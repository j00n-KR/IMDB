0,MartinHafer,"Very good, very vague",8,21 November 2009,"I'm not going to give a long or exhaustive review. A bazillion others have and the movie was released over a year ago--so my giving any sort of in-depth analysis is just needless repetition.The movie's biggest strength is the acting. All three leading actors did a fine job and this was necessary to carry a film that has no special effects, explosions or love scenes. The vagueness of the film is also a strength. After all, the film gets you thinking and yet there is definitely no clear-cut answer as to what really occurred in the film. There is lots of room to foster discussions and debate. And, while I am a strongly opinionated person, I wouldn't have changed much of the film at all--except the very, very end when Meryl Streep's character, for the first and only time, shows some doubt and emotion. This just didn't seem true to her character. Still, this is a minor concern--and who am I to say, since I didn't win the Pulitzer Prize (last time I checked)! Some may hate the vagueness and want a very clear explanation as to what, exactly, the Father did--if anything. Some may hate that the film actually isn't vague enough (I slightly tend towards that). But what I love about all this is that so many different people see so many different things--mostly based on their own prior experiences and expectations. I could easily see someone seeing gay issues, pedophilia (and it's talked ABOUT but never even explicitly said) or a thousand other possibilities--or it could simply be a metaphor for McCarthyism. Who knows? And that makes the film so interesting.",Doubt
1,bkoganbing,The Bell's of St. Nicholas,10,20 October 2012,"From the second I started watching Doubt I was put in mind of The Bells Of St. Mary's where Father O'Malley and Sister Benedict differ over educational policy at St. Mary's school. There was a definite rivalry going there between Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman when Crosby is sent to Bergman's school. But where as those two made beautiful music together in the end, no way will that happen at St. Nicholas School in the Bronx circa 1964.Where the head nun rules with an iron hand and a moral certainty that is frightening to both us the audience and to the rest of the staff. Meryl Streep got one of her many Oscar nominations for this role and I was completely blown away by her performance. She is totally immersed in her character as the tyrannical reverend mother oblivious to outside changes in the world and jealous of her position as dictator of St. Nicholas. Even the very best of players bring something of themselves to the part, they're never 100% in the character. Streep very much is in the character here and in other of her work to a degree I've only seen with one other player, Paul Muni.This is 1964 and St. Nicholas has accepted a black pupil young Joseph Foster and a priest played by Philip Seymour Hoffman is also there to update and bring some policy changes from the real world. This Streep finds intolerable and she goes on a crusade to rid herself of Hoffman by whatever means.Her means is when a sweet young new nun Amy Adams tells her she thinks that Hoffman is showing too much interest in young Miller. Remember in 1964 the priesthood and the nunnery was a refuge for closeted gay people who could have a convenient explanation for why they were not married and raising kids. These sexually frustrated people made the Catholic church and the policies it has. Streep is well aware of this and pursues her vendetta with a frightening gusto.As for Hoffman, he may or may not be gay, but if he were gay he knows what the world was like before taking vows. And he knows change is coming and that little refuge in the Bronx that is St. Nicholas School has to be ready for it. Integrating the school and taking an interest academically in young Foster is part of it. But what if it is more than that.It frighteningly is. When Streep with nothing but rumor to back her up brings it to Foster's mother Viola Davis, she gets an unexpected curve. Davis doesn't want to do anything, just let it all slide after all she just needs to see her son graduate in June.When Streep questions her reasoning and motives, Davis says she thinks she has a gay son and when he showed that he might, his father whom we never see beats him regularly for it. The priest's interest even if it was touched with carnality is better than what he's got at home. And in fact with the stricter discipline in the parochial school, she's reasoned he has less of a chance of being bullied.I was completely blown away by Davis's role and performance. She's a mother first and not left with a lot of good choices. Foster was bullied in public school and 48 years ago there was no place in the world of acceptance for him. She's thinking that if he gets through he can get into a decent high school and leave a frightening childhood. Davis and Adams both were up for Supporting Actress and I give the edge to Davis who might have won if Adams weren't in the same film.Bullying is such a hot button topic today that Doubt is one of the timeliest films I've seen recently. It demonstrates that we can thank God there are now places in an organized LGBT community in many of our largest municipal areas that our kids can go for safe space and acceptance. Some better choices are out there for the Joseph Fosters of the world. The final confrontation climax with Streep and Hoffman is something you will rarely see, two of the very best going head to head. I can only compare it to Spencer Tracy and Fredric March in Inherit The Wind. Hoffman got a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this and it was well deserved. This review is dedicated to a couple of places that operate today for the Joseph Fosters of the world that in 1964 not only did not exist, but were inconceivable then. I speak of the Hetrick-Martin Institute in New York City and the Gay Lesbian Youth Services of Buffalo. What an incredibly different world we live in than when I and the young man young Mr. Foster plays grew up in.",Doubt
2,SnoopyStyle,Three terrific performances but slow at times,8,31 December 2014,"It's 1964 the Bronx. Catholic priest Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) gives a sermon on doubt. Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep) is the strict principal of the school. Sister James (Amy Adams) is a young naive teacher. Donald Miller is the first black student at the school. Beauvier is concerned about Flynn and his sermon. James observes the closeness between Flynn and Donald and shares it with Beauvier. Beauvier sets off to uncover the relationship and sends Flynn out of the school. There is no definitive proof but there is also no relent in Sister Beauvier.It's a laborious start. I almost want Sister Beauvier to break a case at the start like Nancy Drew. If she has doubts, then the audience can't help but have doubts themselves. That's the point of the movie. The audience is never sure. The three leads are terrific but the material doesn't always have the tension. Viola Davis also throws in a great scene. Their performances make this a good movie.",Doubt
3,Hitchcoc,Incredible Acting,9,25 August 2009,"This is a movie filled with memorable scenes. It really captures the Catholic private school milieu of the sixties. The nuns run the school and are overseen by a priest, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Things are a bit harsh, but deliberately so. Meryl Streep plays the principal of the school and is on a continuous campaign to keep the new wave of education reform out of her school. She becomes suspicious of the priest when he takes interest in the only black child in the school. She becomes particularly obsessed when the boy is called out of class for private council. This was in the pre-catholic priest as pedophile days, but it really strikes a chord today. What we are involved with is Streep's acting on her suspicions, coming from a possession of weakness (though she is not weak) as her role relates to the church. She is determined to get him, though she has no hard evidence. This isn't a big movie with flashy events. It takes place behind closed doors. One of the strongest characters in the movie is the boy's mother, who is called in to talk with the principal. There is a scene that will be viewed as one of the best and most real I've ever witnessed. Everyone has their A-game going here. This is an actor's movie.",Doubt
4,Prismark10,The power of words,7,16 April 2014,"Doubt is a film about suspicion and accusation. John Patrick Shanley adapts his stage play and directs as well.Meryl Streep is the head nun and a strict headmistress of a Catholic school in the 1960's. The new priest of the church is a progressive, even a liberal played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman senses a wind of change in the air with a move away from the more stuffy 1950s. He has let in a black pupil to the school. Amy Adams plays a young nun who thinks she might have seen the priest being over friendly to the young black pupil.This leads to a clash of wills between Hoffman and Streep with accusations, gossip and rumour flying around some based on flimsy evidence such as the length of Hoffman's nails or the way he was brushed off by another student.The film is stage bound and could had done more with being opened up more. A key scene is set in the outside with Streep and Viola Davis walking and Davis revealing information about his son. The film could had done with more external shooting.The film does leave you with doubt as to Hoffman's guilt or lack of it. Of course we live in a world now where the abuses of priests in the past are now out in the open, in that sense many viewers opinion may be coloured by real life events rather than Shanley's intentions as expressed in the original play.",Doubt
5,claudio_carvalho,What Do We Do When We Are Not Sure?,8,11 June 2009,"In 1964, the authoritarian and intolerant Principal of the Saint Nichols School, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), rules her school with iron hand, demanding strong discipline to the students and pressing the nuns under her command. When the naive Sister James (Amy Adams) raises suspicious against the progressive and charismatic Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to Sister Beauvier, believing that he might have made advances against the needy and only black student in the school, the prepotent nun begins a campaign to step the priest aside the parochial church, distrusting his explanations and without any evidence against him. ""Doubt"" is a powerful drama about doubts and questionable certainties taking place in a Catholic school in the 60's. This feature is supported first by the magnificent performances of Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman in the lead roles, and Amy Adams and Viola Davis in the support roles; the quartet really deserved their nominations to the Oscar. The theme doubt is justified by the awesome screenplay, with strong and witty lines, that gives powerful elements for the duel between the authoritarian Sister Beauvier that believes that she owns the absolute truth, and the supportive Father Flynn that wishes a progressive education and a welcoming church for his community. The priest's lectures about gossip, intolerance and farewell are simple, but vigorous and effective. The set decoration, landscapes and costumes show the lifestyle in Bronx in the 60's. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Dúvida"" (""Doubt"")",Doubt
6,kosmasp,Bleak and dark,10,6 August 2009,"And when I say dark, I'm not referring to the clothes in the movie. It's morally ambiguous and it might leave you with more questions than answers, but it's striking nevertheless. The powerhouse performances we get to see in this movie, are worthy Oscar contenders and leave free interpretations as to which character will be to your liking (or which character you despise the most).While many movies do give you moral clarity, this one plays with many things, that are never fully uncovered ... or maybe they are and I'm just not willing to accept them? Actually it leaves room for some interpretations of things that went down (no pun intended). It's about guilt, it's about doubt and many other things, that makes us human. How you receive the movie might say a lot more about yourself than the movie itself. Which is a great thing. A movie that actually makes you think, even long after the credits finished ...",Doubt
7,classicsoncall,"""What do you do when you're not sure?""",10,7 October 2012,"""It's an old tactic of cruel people to kill kindness in the name of virtue."" That's what Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) says to Sister James (Amy Adams) in attempting to explain her superior's behavior by accusing him of molesting an altar boy. At this point the confrontation between Flynn and Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) hasn't taken place yet, but you know it will. The principal is guided by one stunning admission that inspires her motivation to expose Father Flynn - ""I'll bring him down"".Some of my best and favorite movies have a certain ambiguity about them. There's the scene at the end of ""Angels With Dirty Faces"" when Father Jerry challenges Rocky Sullivan to show cowardice when he faces execution for his life of crime. So does Rocky go to the chair a hero or a yellow rat? As the viewer you have to decide.Just as you have to decide here whether Father Flynn was a pedophile or a victim of circumstantial elements that cast doubt on his character. I have to admit, this one is a baffler, although the way the script carries the story forward, it just may be that Flynn was guilty. However the film offers a complex dynamic to the proceedings with the introduction of Mrs. Miller (Vioa Davis), who reveals a seriously more disturbing picture of her son's home life than one would expect. By attempting to balance her son's well being against an accusation that may or may not be real, we see how conflicted and torturous it can be to learn the truth.What comes across most strongly, as well it should, is the idea that once a reputation is damaged, there's no going back. Father Flynn's analogy of the pillow and the feathers was a brilliant way to demonstrate how lives can be affected by repeating an assertion that cannot be demonstrably proved, but is accepted and repeated, often to the detriment of the parties on both sides of an accusation. The film's ending bears this out, lending further resonance to the movie's title, because we now understand that doubt has been cast in both directions. That was an effective way to end the story, even if it leaves most viewers with more questions than answers.",Doubt
8,lee_eisenberg,"doubts about faith, but not about the movie",9,12 July 2009,"To the pantheon of voices that Meryl Streep has employed on screen we can now add New York. In John Patrick Shanley's* ""Doubt"", Streep plays the stern, pallid Sister Aloysius Bouvier, head of a catholic school in 1964 New York. The arrival of a new priest (Philip Seymour Hoffman) has invigorated the parish. But when a young nun (Amy Adams) suspects wrongdoing on the priest's part, it challenges the faith of both women.Everyone in the movie did a very good job. Sister Aloysius** is the type who always behaves as though she's about to physically harm you, but it's understood that all her actions are for the good of the school and the people in her inner circle. Father Flynn is not just the new priest in this specific school, but wants to be a new KIND of priest: the type who appeals to the younger generation. Sister James*** is just trying to do her job, trying as hard as possible not to rock the boat, but feels tormented at the events unfolding around her. Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis) only her son to be able to graduate, regardless of the seedy occurrences in the school.Aside from the cast, the setting is perfect. This dowdy institution in autumn-winter gives a feeling of grimness as much as the events taking place inside. And Sister Aloysius's line at the end not only refers to what the movie depicts, but should serve as a wake-up call to anyone excessively entrenched in any religion.Criticism that I read of the film is that it emphasizes shouting between Aloysius and Flynn, and that the redeeming character is the beautiful young woman. I understand this criticism, but it's necessary to understand the overall point of the movie. Aside from looking at the issue of sexual molestation committed by priests, there's also the question of absolute truth. I think that the movie does a very good job looking at both of these, and I definitely recommend it.Also starring Joseph Foster and Alice Drummond (the ""Ghostbusters"" librarian).PS: This is the third movie in which Amy Adams plays a woman whose faith in her lifestyle gets challenged. In ""Junebug"", she befriends a woman but subsequent events damage their friendship. In ""Enchanted"", she plays a fairy tale princess who gets transferred to New York.*Shanley also directed ""The January Man"" and ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" before creating ""Doubt"" for the stage. **Why do nuns have male names?***The tension between Sisters Aloysius and James reminded me a little bit of ""The Flying Nun"", but the events here are definitely no laughing matter.",Doubt
9,jboothmillard,Doubt,6,21 January 2010,"Directed by John Patrick Shanley, writer of Moonstruck and Alive, based on his own play, sounded like it was worth a try, seeing how four of the stars were nominated awards. Basically it is 1964, at St. Nicholas Catholic School in the New York Bronx, where the first black student, twelve-year-old Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II) has come from public school and been accepted. The school is fiercely guarded by the strict discipline of nun Principal Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep), and visited regularly by charismatic priest Father Brendan Flynn (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Philip Seymour Hoffman), who did a good sermon about ""doubt"". One day, while teaching her class, hopeful and innocent nun Sister James (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Amy Adams) notices new student Donald acting very strangely after seeing Father Flynn, and airs her suspicions of something to the Principal. With this accusation of the Father giving the child alcohol to take advantage of him, Sister Aloyisius is on a personal crusade to get to the truth and get rid of the Father she despises. She starts by talking to Donald's mother, Mrs. Miller (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Viola Davis), who is not all that interested in any accusations, as long as her son finishes school in July and the father/husband can't beat him or her. There is the point when Father Flynn and Sister Aloysius finally get into a morality and wills battle to get to the bottom of the matter which could ruin the community. In the end, it seems Father Flynn cannot win the battle and decides to step down, and Sister Aloysius was threatening a phone call to a nun in a parish and get him expelled, but she admits to Sister James that she lied, and that she has such ""doubts"". Also starring Alice Drummond as Sister Veronica, Audrie Neenan as Sister Raymond, Susan Blommaert as Mrs. Carson and Lloyd Clay Brown as Jimmy Hurley. Besides the story, one of the big reasons to see this is for the powerhouse performances from Streep (with her record-breaking fifteenth Oscar nominated performance), Hoffman and Adams, who all get their great moments, it might be a little theatrical, but it is quite a compelling period drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Good!",Doubt
10,rmax304823,To A Moral Certainty.,8,22 November 2009,"It's a fine movie, made for adults. Meryl Streep is the principal of a Catholic school. She's not sadistic but is pretty curmudgeonly and runs the place like Parris Island. Streep takes a dislike to a newly arrived priest, Philip Seymour Hoffman, whom she deems too friendly towards the polished and well-groomed students. She also is offended because Hoffman uses a ball point pen, takes three lumps of sugar in his tea, and has longer fingernails than she thinks proper.Another nun, a history teacher, Amy Adams, has noticed that Hoffman called one of the boys to the rectory, and when he returned she could smell alcohol on his breath and put his head down on the desk -- ""acted queerly"", as Adams puts it.That's all Streep needs. ""I'll bring him down,"" she says. There are two confrontations between Streep and Hoffman. His explanation of the incident in the rectory is that a custodian found the 12-year-old boy tippling the altar wine. He had a chat with the kid and then let him go with the promise of keeping his misbehavior secret, otherwise the kid would have to be dismissed from the altar boys.""You haven't a shred of evidence,"" shouts Hoffman. ""No, but I have my certainty,"" replies Streep in her usual cold and emphatic tone. She wins, too.Did Hoffman molest the boy, as Streep believes? We don't know for sure. It's a probabilistic universe. We can't really be certain of anything. Will the sun rise tomorrow? The only correct answer is ""probably."" But this isn't a movie about probability theory or even religion. It's a movie about power, about who makes the rules around here. And Streep proves that an unyielding absolute certainty, an unflinching drive, will win out over compassion and love. Streep's approach to people and things she identifies as evil could be described as a unilateral, preemptive strike. There is no good word or short phrase to describe her default attitude towards the world in general. Cynicism, I suppose, comes close but you'd have to add a dash of paranoia and a nearly complete absence of an ability to introspect.Streep positively eats up the screen. She's a splendid actress. Yet the script doesn't turn her into an evil witch. That's one of the things I had in mind when I said this was a movie for adults. A cheaper, less thoughtful, more commercial story would have had her going through hell in order to expose Hoffman's priest for the child-molesting monster that he is. Ambiguity rests uncomfortably on minds that are less than mature. All of the roles are complex and demanding, and Hoffman handles his very well, as usual. Amy Adams' nun is caught between the two. The role is that of a sweet wimp but she delivers. So does Viola Davis in two brief but powerful scenes with Streep.Much of the credit goes to John Patrick Shanley's screenplay, which illustrates the personalities of the characters without yielding to long, wordy set speeches that pit one philosophy against another. The two arguments between Streep and Hoffman take up considerable time but are never boring. I mean it as a high accolade when I say it bears watching more than once -- the first time for the story, the second to appreciate the magnificent performances.Nice job, all around. God, those nun's habits are ugly.",Doubt
11,moonspinner55,Cleaning up gossip...like picking up feathers left by the wind,7,25 January 2009,"John Patrick Shanley adapted his own play for the screen and directed this marvelous match-of-wits between a well-liked parish priest and the principal of the adjoining Catholic school, Sister Aloysius, who prides herself on believing she's an all-knowing, all-seeing purveyor of justice. The issue at hand--why the priest called a young boy to the Rectory, and why the youngster returned to class despondent and with alcohol on his breath--becomes a point of contention between the two sides, with an idealistic young Sister finding herself entrapped in the moral morass. Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and, in a smaller but still telling role, Viola Davis give tightly-controlled, absorbing performances--often times what they do not say is just as important, and can be read on their faces. The movie has a shaky beginning, with several quick cuts that seem tentative and yet are obtuse; also, Streep's Aloysius, the ""dragon"" lady, is introduced to us rather poorly (we observe her observing the others in a somewhat villainous way--the film makes up our minds how we should feel about her before we have the chance). However, by the 30-minute mark, the agenda here becomes more clear, and we see the chess match Sister Aloysius amusingly, clumsily sets up (she's like the malicious child from ""The Children's Hour""). John Patrick Shanley is a talented writer and filmmaker who is overly-fond of symbolic touches (a cat employed to kill a mouse, light bulbs fizzling out on cue); he runs the risk of leaving some viewers unsatisfied by not dwelling on details (such as the students and their problems), yet I found his touch surprisingly light and flexible on the whole. It's marvelous fun watching these two figureheads going at it and yet, on the other hand, I suspect this scenario may not be far removed from reality. ""Doubt"" doesn't dig deeply into private matters; Shanley (thankfully) leaves out the histrionics inherent to the situation. Instead, his work is a treatise on human fallibility, and a good one. *** from ****",Doubt
12,blanche-2,"Thought-provoking film, powerhouse performances",9,29 December 2011,"John Patrick Shanley has done a magnificent job of adapting his play ""Doubt"" for film, and an equally fine job of directing it.I was very privileged to see this play on Broadway with two of the most gifted actors on stage, Cherry Jones and Brian O'Byrne, both of whom could have starred in this film. Of course it wouldn't have made a red cent, so Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman were cast, two brilliant actors, and although different from the stage cast, they are both equally effective.The story is set in 1964 where the principal of a school, Sister Aloysius, suspects Father Flynn of taking an inappropriate interest in a black student, Donald. Flynn denies this, stating that the boy, as the only black boy in the school, needs friendship and guidance. The final confrontation between the nun and priest is one of the most riveting scenes you'll ever see. When I saw it in the theater, I thought my heart would stop.Shanley has deliberately left the question of whether or not Father Flynn is a pedophile ambiguous, and this is what makes the film fascinating. Persuasive arguments can be made on both sides, and behavior can be interpreted in different ways. It's a great life lesson if nothing else.I can't help but compare this cast with the cast I saw. First of all, Shanley has created the real Catholic McCoys as they were in 1964 - the killer nun, the buddy priest, and the sweet, naive young nun (Amy Adams) who takes one side over another. As the inflexible Sister Aloysius, Meryl Streep is terrific and gives a much more emotional performance than I saw on stage, while Hoffman gives a less emotional one but brings a gentleness to the role. Both approaches work for both roles, as they are so well structured. Adams is perfect as the young, confused nun caught between these two formidable personalities. As Donald's mother, Viola Davis gives us another point of view, the point of view of someone who cares deeply about her son but is pragmatic, too, and feels limited in her choices.Highly recommended and makes for a great debate. Though as one who went through 12 years of Catholic school, I have to admit that the stage actress Cherry Jones was EXACTLY like the nuns I had in school. Mean ones.",Doubt
13,Quinoa1984,"dynamite cast, if nothing else thought provoking, sublime direction",10,26 December 2008,"This wasn't simply one of those ""guessing-game"" type of stories that come right out of the theater. It appears to be on first sight: simply, did Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) have ""inappropriate contact"" with the one black boy at the Bronx Catholic school, Donald Miller, in the rectory? Sister Aloysius (Streep) is certain as soon as she hears it from the un-certain Sister James (Adams). It should come down to a simple did-he-or-didn't-he, which for some will be obvious. But even if Doubt was just on that count, which it isn't, it would still be one powerful punch of drama. As it turns out it's not about the hot-button Priest-pedophilia topic, but about a class system, more than one, what turns some into hard-as-nails types like Sister Aloysius and defensive like Mrs. Miller (Davis), Donald's mother, and so seemingly caring like Flynn. What is authority, and how does one submit to right and wrong when things are completely out of balance, out of the tenants of Catholicism and just man vs. woman power struggles? This movie made me think a lot - the outcome of Flynn particularly had me wondering, and then going back in my mind hours after the film ended to ponder the little moments that may (or may not, though more-so leaning towards definitely) gave him away to Aloysius. This is a major credit to Hoffman, who pulls out what I think is one of his top 3 or 4 performances (and think out of the cannon that comes from), who has such conviction as this priest, moments of tenderness and (possibly) righteous anger... and then those little moments, like when he suddenly asks Aloysius in the heat of their climactic argument ""Have you never done wrong?"" that suddenly really makes things interesting. This isn't just bombast between two heavyweights like Hoffman and Streep, but a master's class in subtlety, tone, the way a face looks when it tries to look controlled.This is also for Streep one of her ""BIG"" performances- the kind where towards the very end, and you'll know the moment as it is in fact the last couple of lines she has, you just wish someone would knock an Oscar at her head and say 'hey, stop crying, you've earned it, again!- where what starts as a performance of amusing dimensions (we all know this teacher, whether or not you've gone to Catholic school, for me it was my own middle school principal Dr. Schwartz) transforms into something even trickier than Hoffman's performance, if that's possible: she's not some ruthless task-master or makes-your-blood-turn-cold type, but someone who wants to look out for her parish. And, perhaps, for her own salvation deep down.I also shouldn't neglect to mention Amy Adams and especially Viola Davis; Adams has been around now for a little while, and has shown herself to be a wonderful actress, an innocent but easily troubled person of conscience who has a great scene when she gets tempered at a boy in class, but Davis, who mostly has character actor parts and TV work, steals her scene practically and goes head-to-head with Streep in one of those revelatory scenes that works on multiple levels. Rarely would I say an actor who appears for 10 or 12 minutes should get an Oscar but she too, probably more than Streep, should sweep it up- it is that heartbreaking and soulful and all that and a bag of acting chips.But just so you don't think that Doubt is simply an actors film, the filmmaker, who's only previous directorial credit in film being Joe Vs the Volcano (and now, not too oddly enough, a Pulizter winner for this play), opens up the production to not feel simply stuffed into one or two rooms. This I would credit majorly to Roger Deakins who between this and Revolutionary Road (and in minor part as consultant on WALL-E) continues his hot streak as one of those artists I can gush about any time of day. Yet there's also intelligence in spurts to Shanley's style; pay attention to those shots when the camera is titled on a character- it happens during the talk between Flynn and James- and how those little symbolic touches like a burst lightbulb and wind and rain and leaves aren't just cheap little gimmicks. They're at least fun parts to the story.In one of those mammoth Oscar seasons where the studios drop a lot of movies on somewhat unsuspecting audiences all at once (i.e. Revolutionary Road, the Wrestler, Defiance, the Reader), some better than others and some just overrated or flashy, Doubt can stand up against all of that. It's simply an excellent drama, filmed and acted in a manner that keeps the audience's attention completely centered. If you hear someone talking during any of the heated exchanges or quiet ones or just a momentary glance, they shouldn't go to see movies. Period.",Doubt
14,edwagreen,No Doubt About It. A Great Film ****,10,8 April 2009,"Father Flynn, in a sermon, states that doubt creates a bond. How right he is.This is a knockout film, one for the ages as Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams turn in monumental performances. Viola Davis, in a one scene stealer, is also quite effective here.What really went on in Father Flynn's office? That remains to be seen.Streep, who was never better, and who has the ability to assume those great accents, takes on an authentic N.Y. one. In many scenes she sounds like the late Connie Gilchrist, a wonderful character supporting actress of the 1930s and 1940s.Streep pulls absolutely no punches as the stern, old-fashioned parochial principal of the 1950s. Bitter by the fact that she lost her husband in World War 11 and afraid to accept a changing American culture, she hides behind all this and is absolutely a brutal principal and person to deal with. She is the very old-fashioned principal who many a teacher suffered under.She goes after Father Flynn after a student allegedly drinks wine from a holy ceremony. Hoffman was made for the role of Father Flynn in the same priestly way as Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald earned their angelic wings in ""Going My Way."" He will certainly come into conflict with Sister Aloysius (Streep) as he wants change and understanding. Amy Adams stars as the shy, nerd-like nun who catches Father Flynn in a questionable scene and immediately reports back to Sister Aloysius.There are flaming scenes here between Sister and the boy's mother. The latter is played by Viola Davis, who seems to be the prototype for blacks in society circa 1964 when the film takes place. She doesn't want to rock the boat, she fears her husband and her son will be graduating in June.This is definitely a contemporary film as it alludes to priest misconduct in recent and past years.",Doubt
15,michaelRokeefe,Suspenseful and riveting.,8,8 April 2009,"Two brilliant stars, Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and a mesmerizing story. Set in the winter of 1964, Sister Aloysius(Streep) is a fear inspiring and extremely disliked principal of the Saint Nicholas Church School.

16,sunwarrior13,A Movie That Asks Hard Questions,10,16 September 2012,"Doubt is a film adaptation of John Patrick Shanley's Pulitzer Prize winning fiction stage play Doubt: A Parable. Written and directed by Shanley and produced by Scott Rudin, the film stars Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis. When the principal of a Bronx Catholic High School accuses a popular priest of pedophilia, a young nun caught in between the feuding pair becomes hopelessly swept up in the ensuing controversy. 1964, St. Nicholas, the Bronx: The winds of change are sweeping through this tight-knit religious community, and charismatic priest Father Flynn is doing his best to adapt by revisiting the school's notoriously strict disciplinary practices. Unfortunately Father Flynn's progressive ideas stand in stark contrast to the longstanding beliefs of Sister Aloysius Beauvier, the iron-willed principal, who believes that an oppressive environment of punishment and fear is the only way to keep the student body in line. Suddenly into this tempestuous environment appears young Donald Miller, St. Nicholas' first black student. When hopeful innocent Sister James reluctantly reveals to Sister Beauvier that Father Flynn and Donald have been spending an unusual amount of time together in the church rectory, the unrelentingly righteous headmistress begins a merciless crusade to reveal the beloved clergyman as a lecherous child molester and have him permanently expunged from the school. Yet despite her moral certainty that Father Flynn has committed such an unspeakable transgression, Sister Beauvier has not a shred of actual evidence to back up her audacious claim. Now, as Sister Beauvier and Father Flynn enter into an epic battle of wills, the shock waves set into motion by their explosive confrontation threaten to destroy one man's reputation and tear apart the entire surrounding community. Doubt asks hard questions, and we dutifully squirm in reply.Thanks to a nearly perfect cast,the movie excels in terms of acting performances.The film's four main actors were heavily praised for their acting, and all of them were nominated for Oscars. Viola Davis received her first nomination and Amy Adams received her second nomination for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Philip Seymour Hoffman received his second nomination of Best Supporting Actor, and third overall, while Meryl Streep received her twelfth nomination for Best Actress and her fifteenth overall. This provocative glimpse into the Catholic priest child-molestation scandal manages to be deeply disturbing on several levels.As a movie, very little actually happens. It's a lot of discussion about what might have happened or may occur in future.",Doubt

Suspecting Sister James is correct Sister Beauvier tells Father Brendan Flynn to leave the parish No prizes for guessing why the BBC showed this film . It's a tribute to the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman . That said because the premise also involves child sexual abuse the film is given added topicality . Let me explain to non British members website . For the last few months we have seen many British celebrities being either arrested , charged or taken to court on sexual abuse charges . Several big profile cases have already taken place with most of the defendants being found not guilty . The jury have seen all the evidence put in front of them , have weighed up the evidence and returned their verdict . The sad thing is that even is someone is found not guilty then there's still the element of no smoke without fire . It's a sad fact amongst certain sections of the general public that they seem to take it upon themselves that they know better than a jury who have seen all the evidence . If I was sitting on a jury I'd make sure I'd weighed up all the evidence This is the problem with DOUBT . The audience are presented with no evidence what so ever . Sister James is suspicious relays her suspicions to the mother superior who instantly judges Father Brendan guilty because ... well because . She knows better , she's had experience in these cases and that's the end of it . Let's not beat about the bush here . Father Brendan is a catholic priest and that should be enough to get anyone's secular spidey senses tingling . However the supposed child victim doesn't make any allegations and it's left to sour faced religious zealots to judge if their peer is guilty of something . There is a very strong element that the mother superior simply doesn't like Father Brendan possibly because he is popular with his flock so she might be pursuing an agenda of her own . This ambiguity is paradoxically the story's strength but at the same time its major weakness . Father Brendan may be a paedophile or he may not be . We never find out and because all the protagonists worship the cult of superstition it's very difficult for this humanist audience member to empathise with any of them . DOUBT is a well acted film but because the ambiguity is the entire subtext I'm going to have to return a not proved verdict",Doubt
18,Doylenf,Fascinating confrontations in a story about morality and authority in the Church...,7,26 May 2009,"John Patrick Shanley has turned his prize-winning stage drama into a cinema version that is richly flavored and expands slightly on his theme of power, corruption and moral authority in a Catholic Church during the 1960s. At the heart of the tale is a progressive-minded priest (PHILIP SEYMOUR Hoffman) who is viewed as highly suspect by a tyrannical nun (MERYL STREEP) who personifies all that was wrong with the strict nuns who thought that harsh discipline and humiliation was the way to rule the school classroom. The old vs. the new is what happens when these two clash.Very unlike what happened when Hollywood first tackled the subject of old vs. new in films like GOING MY WAY and THE BELLS OF ST. MARY'S where a young priest has to cope with the unchanging steel will of a crusty old parish priest.Here the subject matter is much more serious too, involving the suspicions of a nun eager to seize on any reason for ridding the parish of Father Flynn whom she accuses of an immoral act with a young altar boy in his charge, based on very flimsy evidence of another naive young Sister James (AMY ADAMS).The story becomes a character study of these three as they confront the issues raised by the domineering Sister Aloysius (Streep) who insists on a private meeting with Flynn in which the accusations fly fast and furious. This scene is super-charged with emotion and dramatically effective--but even more striking fireworks are yet to come when we meet the mother of the boy (VIOLA DAVIS) who is brilliant in her two big scenes with Streep during which another twist is given to the tale.To tell any more would be to spoil this for anyone not familiar with the material. Clearly, Shanley has written a very powerful drama and staged it with simplicity and truth in a way that is cinematic without losing any of its dramatic force as a play.For the performances alone, highly recommended as a thinking man's morality play that never quite gives you the feeling that you know all the answers to the riddle presented. It's open to many interpretations, but there's no doubt about one thing--this is a very fine drama.",Doubt
19,preppy-3,Depressing but powerful,8,28 September 2010,"This takes place in a Catholic school in the Bronx in 1964. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a well-liked priest at the church. Sister James (Amy Adams) has some questions about a very close relationship he has with a 12 year old black student (Joseph Foster). She (unwisely) tells the tyrannical principal of the school Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep) of her suspicions. Right away Sister Aloysius believes he's guilty and sets out to get rid of him. It leads to quite a few troubling ends.Stark and powerful. This addresses what has been quite a hot button issue in the past--pedophile priests assaulting alter boys--and still comes up today. John Philip Shanley wrote the play, screenplay AND directed this one. The dialogue is sharp and great but perhaps Shanley took on too much. His direction is good but the tilted camera angles don't work and there's some hysterically obvious symbolism--Sister Aloysius' office is painted dark green and TWICE a light burns on when someone makes a dramatic point! Don't even get me started on the frequent windstorms. Still--this works. It's a quiet movie but it doesn't dance around the issue--it gets as blunt as you could get in 1964. The only real explosion is at the end when Hoffman and Streep go at it full force.The acting is superb. Amy Adams is given little to do (and disappears halfway through the movie) but she's good. Foster is very good as the young man(even though he's obviously way too old to be 12) and the look on his face at the end is heart-breaking. However Hoffman and Streep are incredible. Hoffman makes his character extremely likable without overdoing it and you see his confusion, anger and pain underneath the surface when he's accused. Streep (as always) was incredible. She's basically the main character and she REALLY chews the scenery but in a quiet way. Her Bronx accent gets annoying at times but her acting carries it through.So--depressing, dark and troubling but an excellent drama. Well worth seeing.",Doubt

Or as the priest pleads, become involved in.Unfortunately, that is not the films intent. It blows us back and forth like a strong wind. So we find ourselves in a purgatorial state of having to choose when there is no choice.

21,dbborroughs,A good film but demonic Sister Aloysius is silly to the point of causing giggles,7,25 January 2009,"I was not a fan of Doubt when it was on Broadway. I liked it but didn't love it,certainly not Pulitzer worthy. I found it too much of a problem play where people sit around and discuss ideas in ways that were meant to explore the ideas more then they were meant to be real. I found Sister Aloysius monstrous and almost comical. I did think it was nicely compact and did what it did and got off.It was with some trepidation that I sat down to watch John Patrick Shanley's film of his play. My reaction was less than I had hoped.The plot has Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) suspecting that all is not right with Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), particularly with his relationship with one of the boys in the school. There is no evidence that anything really happened but the Sister is damn certain something did and she is going to make sure that Father Flynn is removed. As events occur that can be taken any number of ways the heat increases and a battle of wills transpires.In opening up his play Shanley has brought the story closer to the real world. There are more characters, more events and many characters are deepened. Unfortunately, in my eyes anyway, the resulting opening up has made Sister Aloysius seem almost laughable. To be certain she is a monster of epic proportions and I know that there are and were many nuns (and people) who are very similar to her but what worked on stage as a symbol of the stone like past of the church and the world, refusing to change, comes off on screen, in the real world, as a caricature. I found her silly and I found I was giggling more than anything else, especially with her ever shifting accent. Several critics in their reviews of the film said they found Streep to be in another movie from the rest of the cast, and in some ways I did too. Its the construction of the character, as I said she is the symbol of stagnation in a world of change, and she is more archetype then real person. She is just a rigid construct and not a real person, this would have worked on stage but not in a reality based film. (And mark my words its going to be role that becomes spoofed for years to come to the point of becoming a cliché) The battle between stage and the screen is all over the film. What was a series of scenes on the stage where people effectively sat around and talked about what they have seen or might have seen now become a series of scenes where we actually see the events.For me the opening up of the play makes the story not one full of doubt, rather one that seems confused. Events that on stage were only revealed as events others saw transpire are now seen by all to happen. The angst some characters feel at what they saw is now lessened because we see the events (the locker) for example. We also have to contend with a a vastly increased number of characters (the original play had four) so additionally the story is shaded by actually seeing all of these people. How can we feel the uncertainty of what the sisters saw or feel when we see the same events. On some level, the very thing the film is about, doubt, is removed because we see things.I know its not fair to compare the film with the play, since they are different, but at the same time I couldn't stop doing so because there were things the film was doing that didn't work for me (as opposed to the recent Frost Nixon which transcended it stage origins into something truly cinematic). Perhaps Ihad I not been exposed to the play I might have liked this better. As it stands now I found it a good but not great adaptation of a good but not great play.Around 7 out of 10 (when Meryl Streep doesn't cause me to giggle)",Doubt

Clearly written originally for the stage the opening out though skilfully done is academic as is any moral, ethical stance given that writer director Shanley (who also wrote the original play) deliberately offers no solution other than that in the mind of the viewer. Perhaps because her role is so small compared to the other three Viola Davis tends to make the most impact so that it is her performance as the mother of a son who may or may not have been abused by a priest, that tends to stay with you. This isn't the same as saying that those of Meryl Streep as the principal of the Catholic school who confronts Philip Seymour Hoffman's Father Flynn or Amy Adams as the go-between Sister Jane are chopped liver.

Director John Patrick Shanley adapted his Pulitzer-winning stage play and delivers a first-rate drama about a feud between an intractable nun, Sister Aloysius Beavier (Meryl Streep of ""Lions for Lambs), and a compassionate priest, Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Moffman of ""Mission Impossible III""), who she suspects may have abused the only African-American student at their school.Sister James (Amy Adams of ""Enchanted"") sees Father Flynn stuff a shirt into young Donald Miller's locker and later the lad returns from a meeting with Father Flynn and the sister smells alcohol on the youth's breath. Promptly, she reports her findings to Sister Aloysius and the wheels begin to turn in the elder sister's devious mind. Meryl Streep makes a terrific villain with her wire-framed spectacles wrapped around her sharp-nosed, forbidding countenance. She resembles a menacing vulture and the students at the Catholic school are all properly intimidated by her. She likes to patrol the church during Flynn's sermons and reprimand children who are either whispering to one another or sleeping. She confiscates a transistor radio with an ear-plug from one student in Sister James' class and winds up becoming addicted to the device. She constantly mentors the naive Sister James. At one point, and it is worth remembering in the greater scheme of things, she insists that the sister hang an out-of-date photograph of a previous Pope on the chalk board so that she can see the reflection of the class room in it when she is writing on the chalk board with her back to the class. Sure enough, Sister James gets to bust an unruly student.Incidentally, ""Doubt"" takes place in the year 1964, and the evil Sister will let nothing stand in her way to railroad Father Flynn. The strategy that she resorts to is pretty mind-boggling. At 104 minutes, ""Doubt"" bristles with subtlety and nuance than most movies dream about and every performance is inspired.

26,Boba_Fett1138,Really solid.,8,13 August 2009,"Even though this movie always got praised a lot, there also had been some criticism at it, claiming that the movie was nothing more but a filmed stage-play. Normally movies based on stage-plays also sort of bother more, since it obviously got written for a different medium and this doesn't always translate too well to the silver-screen. This however really wasn't the case for me with this movie. It's simply a solid movie, with a good story and of course more than great actors.It's a pure movie, that only relies solely on its script and actors. It directed by the man who also was behind the play; John Patrick Shanley.The movie leaves lots or room for speculation, since it doesn't explain everything that happens in the movie. The movie is more about the human nature and how individuals act in certain situations. A real character movie, that gets made all the more powerful due to main actors. the movie got nominated for a total of 5 Oscar's, of which 4 were for actors. This already says enough about it I think.Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep are two favorite actors of mine and you already knew from the moment that they were cast in this movie, the movie was going to be something special. Amy Adams was a bit of a surprising casting choice as a nun, since she mostly plays the pretty girl, in romantic-comedy like movies. But she also dares to be ugly in this movie and due to this her acting skills becomes more visible. She is simply a great actress who doesn't feel out of place at all within this movie and doesn't get played off the screen by its two leading, acclaimed, powerhouse actors.A great movie to watch, though perhaps a bit too heavy and not cinematic challenging enough to watch for some people, since the movie in its essence is pretty simple and besides its story and acting doesn't feature much more elements that deserve to be mentioned.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Doubt

28,neil-476,Excellent,8,27 February 2009,"For the most part, Doubt was exactly what the trailers had led me to expect. Progressive Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) gets on the wrong side of traditional Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) at the 1960s Catholic School where she is principal. A power struggle follows based on the possibility that Flynn may have groomed - or more - one of the boys in an improper relationship.The title, of course, gives away the strength of the movie - there are always explanations for the happenstances which cause Sister Aloysius' concern about Father Flynn, so the audience is always in doubt in the face of Sister Aloysius' implacable determination to see this man cast out despite having no concrete evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing on his part. As a viewer, I half wanted a definite answer. Conversely, I was very pleased that there wasn't one - nothing so glib as a problem-solving easy answer in a scenario which surely mirrored not only the actual instance it was based on, but many others.The performances are all, as one might expect, brilliant. There is nothing too showy but, for my book, Streep puts in a performance as good as anything she's ever done, playing someone whose actions might be deemed evil if it weren't for the fact that she is doing something she is driven to do out of a sense of protecting children.And, while the film kept me interested throughout, the final minute or two simply devastated me in a short coda which only an actress of Streep's quality could have pulled off.",Doubt
29,evanston_dad,To Doubt Is Human,8,22 December 2008,"""Doubt can be a bond as strong as fear."" If ever there was a time in our country's recent history where that line carried the force of relevance, it's now.And though it's set in the early 1960s (roughly a year after the Kennedy assassination), there's no doubt that John Patrick Shanley's adaptation of his own Pulitzer-Prize winning stage play is a response to these dark times, when the only thing that seems to be uniting Americans is their collective insecurity and ever-weakening belief that things are going to get better.At the center of ""Doubt"" is the mystery of whether or not a priest (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is guilty of taking advantage of an altar boy. The priest's primary (and really sole) prosecutor is Sister Aloysius, the uber-stern and terrifying principal of the Catholic school that provides ""Doubt"" its setting. Watching Hoffman and Streep spar is like watching two professional tennis players at their best, and fans of expert movie acting should waste no time in seeing the sparks fly between these two. The movie purposely never clarifies the ambiguity of the charges -- is Hoffman's priest truly guilty of something, or is Sister Aloysius simply on a mad witch hunt? Streep's character is the most fascinating. From one perspective, she's a nearly maniacal harpie, intent on ruining a man's life and career for no clear reason. However, if her accusations are legitimate, she's a sort of hero, demanding justice from a male-dominated world that's willing to look the other way. Streep's performance is something fascinating to behold -- she can convey more with an arched eyebrow than another actor can with his entire face.Amy Adams gets the pivotal role of a young, innocent nun who first brings her suspicions about the priest to her superior, and then sees them become Frankenstein's monster. In many ways, Adams' character is us, the audience, placed in the position of having to come to a conclusion on our own when empirical evidence is lacking. Adams' role is the least showy, but she does much with it.And then there's Viola Davis, who, in five minutes of screen time, decimates the audience with some shocking conclusions of her own as the altar boy's mother. The insulated, hushed world of the Catholic Church is blown wide open by this struggling mother, who's seen more of the world than any of the priests and nuns sheltered behind the church's walls, and who puts the film's running themes of racial and gender inequality into harsh perspective.The central conflict in ""Doubt"" in many ways comes down to each individual's view of the world and his or her ability to accept the ambiguity of day to day living. There's a lot about the world we will never know and much about our futures we'll never be able to control. So what's better -- anticipating the worst and therefore being prepared when it comes; or believing in the best and running the risk of being disappointed when it fails to arise? The movie just poses this question -- it doesn't try to answer it. ""Doubt"" is not a fancy movie and will win no awards for its cinematic audacity. But in looking back at the movies of 2008, I imagine it will stand as one of the best-acted films of the year.Grade: A",Doubt
30,ferguson-6,Frosty the Heretic,7,14 December 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. Talk about credentials!! Pulitzer Prize winning play, a famous and talented playwright/screenwriter, two of the best screen actors in history, an amazing and prize winning cinematographer ... what more could one ask? Well, I am still unable to answer that question, but I feel some detail is missing, thereby preventing this from being a truly great film.Don't doubt my enjoyment. This is a very nice film with a powerful message. In all honesty, I felt I was watching an actor's workshop. Each scene was stunning on its own. Watching Streep and PS Hoffman go head to head a few times is some of the most fun I have ever had in a theatre; much better than Pacino and Deniro in the much inferior ""Righteous Kill"". And just as terrific was Amy Adams as the heart of gold nun torn between the always-certain Sister Streep and the seemingly ever-so-kind and progressive Father Hoffman. Watching her attempts to follow in the senior nun's footsteps is painful (in a brilliant way), just as her always hopeful perspective that everything is fine now.Viola Davis is generating much Oscar buzz for her brief, but hypnotic appearance as the mother of the boy whom the Priest's alleged indiscretion was aimed. Ms. Davis captures a world that the protected Nun could never comprehend and absolutely catches the accusatory nun off-guard with her reaction. That scene was the soul of the film for me, even more than the nose to nose battle in the principal's office.John Patrick Shanley is the playwright for this story and for some unknown reason, he chose to direct as well. With a credit like ""Joe versus the Volcano"" on his resume, we must wonder why this was allowed. Supreme cinematographer Roger Deakins (a frequent Coen Brothers collaborator) delivers his customary perfect work, even in the confined quarters of the rectory and school. Still, I can't help but wonder if a true professional director could have elevated this film to the next level. One can only assume ego is to blame.Still, don't hesitate to see this film. It will keep you thinking and glued to the screen. Many view Streep's final scene as the key to the film. For me it was the reaction of the boy when the Priest announces he his leaving the church and school. The last thing I want to add is this film had one of the best trailer's I have ever seen. Ms. Streep was truly terrifying and I was incredibly anxious for this film to hit Dallas. I wish more studios would follow suit ... get us excited, but leave us wanting and guessing.",Doubt
31,HotToastyRag,Incredible performances by Streep and Hoffman,10,30 April 2020,"Doubt is the perfect example of excellent acting propelling a story. It's a simple plot, the supporting cast doesn't stand out, and there are no exotic locales to distract you. Based off a John Patrick Shanley play, and directed by Shanley himself, this incredibly powerful drama stars Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep. Both were rewarded with well-deserved Oscar nominations, but Hoffman's nomination was relegated to the Supporting Actor category. When you watch this movie, you know how ridiculous that error was: not only was he the only man in the movie, but the entire story was about his character. Whatever the category, he shines and gives a wonderful performance.Hoffman stars as a priest with unorthodox sermons. Rather than shout about sin and preach from the pulpit, he talks softly about compassion, love, and tolerance. In the 1960s, when this story takes place, his approach is quite different, and some are threatened by the changes he brings. Meryl Streep is a nun who prefers tradition, and she's immediately suspicious of Hoffman. Why is he so different? Why won't he conform? And why is he so kind to a young, black altar boy who's getting bullied? Once again, the 1960s, his behavior is shocking.Both Viola Davis and Amy Adams were nominated for Supporting Actress, but they're not what will keep you returning to this movie time after time. Hoffman and Streep make this movie so excellent. They're two classically trained artists who are perfect during every moment, ace every line, and provide meaningful expressions.

It would be difficult to imagine a finer cast, here cast in roles counter to their usual types, bringing such power to the poetry of Shanley's lines. The story is well known by now (the dismissal of a progressive priest by a crotchety old Catholic school principal over a false rumor and all the 'doubt ' that brings into play in every character), but multiple viewings of this film intensify the humanity of each of the characters and demonstrate just how fine a writer Shanley is.

33,zetes,A battle of wits,8,4 January 2009,"I was a little wary of this one, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. It's much like another one of my favorite 2008 films, Frost/Nixon, which is also based on a play. Both are extremely well acted battles of wits. It's almost like watching a great wrestling match. The biggest muscles here belong to the venerable Meryl Streep, an actress who never ceases to surprise me. It's weird, because she's just given so many great performances. You don't think she'll be able to do anything new, but then she pops up here with a great character, one that doesn't really resemble anything else she's done. She's equally matched by Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of the finest actors of his generation. And I, for one, thought Amy Adams held her own against these two powerhouses. It helps that she's perfectly cast as the innocent, trusting nun. It fits her like a glove. And like everyone else who's reviewed the film, I'd give high praise to Viola Davis. It's pretty much a kind of one-scene-wonder performance, but it's certainly memorable. I have a couple of complaints that keep this film from the highest ranks of my year-end list. I thought Shanley's direction just plain sucked much of the time. Yeah, his script is brilliant, but he hasn't directed a film since 1990 (and it was Joe Versus the Volcano), and it shows. He resorts to some extremely cheap tricks in order to distance the story from its stage-bound origins. He likes to tilt his camera, like he's making The Third Man, and it feels ridiculous. During the climactic sequence, Shanley inserts a thunderstorm that keeps growing until the scene hits its peak. Just cheap and unnecessary. As is the sequence demonstrating Hoffman's sermon about gossip. There's so much power in the simple confrontations between the characters, all these flourishes should just have been dropped. The film is going to be accused of being stagy in any case. Shanley should have just accepted that. I also wasn't quite sold on the final moment of the film.

A priest is suspected of having ""improper relations"" with one of the students in the catholic school where he is stationed and the entire film is a play around if the suspicion is true or not. But the basic concept of the movie is that truth ultimately cannot be known and that only faith can decide on the value of an undecidable sentence.The film is a bit slow, but it has to be in order to work. That does make it a little boring, so you have to be in the mood for a tense psychological drama, which this movie is, in order to enjoy it. The performances of the actors are very good, and that is the reason why I graded the movie above average. Of course, being average in the category of psychological drama puts it well above other good movies.Bottom line: it is worth the watch, but prepare yourself to see it from start to finish and to feel it lasts too long.",Doubt
35,JamesHitchcock,He takes too much sugar in his tea,8,23 February 2009,"Like ""Catholic Boys"" (aka ""Heaven Help Us""), ""Doubt"" is set in the mid sixties in a Catholic school in New York and, like that film and many others set in that particular decade, uses its sixties setting as a kind of cinematic shorthand for ""clash between progressive values and conservative ones"". There is, of course, a major difference between the two films. ""Catholic Boys"" is a comedy which uses this clash as a source of humour, some of it satirical. ""Doubt"" is a deeply serious film; one might even say a tragedy.The clash between tradition and progress was particularly intense within the Catholic Church at this date, as this was the period of the reforming Second Vatican Council which sat between 1962 and 1965. (The film itself is set in 1964). The two sides are represented by Father Flynn, the liberal parish priest, and Sister Aloysius, the strict Principal of the school attached to the church. It is notable that Sister Aloysius has on the wall of her office a picture not of Paul VI, who would have been the incumbent Pope in 1964, nor of his immediate predecessor John XXIII, who was responsible for convening Vatican II, but of John's predecessor Pius XII, regarded by many Catholics as a champion of conservative values.The two dislike one another intensely, and the main action of the film concerns Sister Aloysius's suspicions about the relationship between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, an altar boy. Donald has recently been admitted to the school as its only black student, a development which has aroused resentment among some of the other pupils and their parents. (A reminder that, although we normally associate segregation with the Deep South, the Northern states also had their own forms of racial discrimination). Sister Aloysius begins to suspect that Father Flynn has been sexually abusing the boy and, although she has no real evidence to support her suspicions, begins a campaign to force him to resign. As the film progresses, our sympathies shift first to one side, then to the other. At times we begin to fear that Sister Aloysius's suspicions may be well-founded; at others it seems as though she has launched a spiteful campaign of persecution against a blameless man for no other reason than that she dislikes his theology. Much of her dislike of him, in fact, seems to be centred on trivial reasons, such as that he writes with a ballpoint pen rather than a fountain pen and that he takes too much sugar in his tea.""Doubt"" is based upon a stage play by John Patrick Shanley, who also wrote the screenplay and directed the film. With its limited range of settings (mostly interiors) and lengthy dialogues, the film clearly betrays its theatrical origins. Nevertheless, Shanley is able to turn these features of the film into strengths. The indoor settings suggest a sense of claustrophobia; when the characters venture outside they often seem trapped between tall buildings. The action takes place in autumn and winter and the weather we see outside (grey skies, a thunderstorm, snow) seems to reflect the characters' emotions. Although the film is set in the sixties, the style of decor of the rooms, and most of the furniture, suggests a date several decades before that, adding to the atmosphere of intellectual conservatism.Although dialogue predominates over physical action, that is no weakness when the dialogue is spoken by actors as talented as Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams as the naive young Sister James, who is initially responsible for arousing Sister Aloysius's suspicions about the priest but later comes to accept his explanations. There is also a good cameo from Viola Davis as Donald's mother Ida who asks Sister Aloysius not to pursue her suspicions. Ida believes her son to be gay and sees Father Flynn as the only man who has ever shown him kindness. All four received Oscar nominations, but none of them won. I felt, in fact, that Streep was better than Kate Winslet who won for ""The Reader"". Winslet's performance was technically good but with an emotional and spiritual void at the centre, whereas Streep, putting the ghastly ""Mamma Mia"" behind her, gave one of her best performances. Nevertheless, Streep already has two Oscars whereas Winslet had previously been nominated five times without success. You do the maths.(Incidentally, I wonder if Streep ever will win a third Oscar; her second, for ""Sophie's Choice"" came as long ago as 1983, although she has received eleven nominations since. There sometimes seems to be an unofficial rule that if you've already got two Oscars you cannot win a third. Unless your name is Katharine Hepburn).The theme of doubt runs through the film. It opens with Father Flynn giving a sermon on the nature of doubt and concluding that like faith, it can be a unifying force. It ends, after Flynn has been forced to resign, with Aloysius admitting in tears to Sister James, ""I have such doubts"". I must admit that I was disappointed by the ending which seems too abrupt and does not clarify the nature of Aloysius's doubts. Did she mean doubts about her faith in general, or doubts about Flynn's guilt? Or doubts about the justice of a God who can allow a guilty man to go unpunished? (After he resignation Flynn was transferred by the Church authorities to another, more prestigious, parish; effect a promotion). It is certainly true that in some cases an outward show of certainty can mask inner doubts and conflicts, but as Aloysius has hitherto appeared a person of unshakable convictions, untroubled by doubts of any kind, this sudden, unexplained revelation comes as a shock. A greater emphasis on her psychological development and a less hurried ending might have made for a stronger film.With that one reservation, however, I found ""Doubt"" to be a powerful, well-written and well-acted drama, one of the best films of 2008. 8/10",Doubt
36,Smells_Like_Cheese,The actor's movie,7,17 June 2009,"Doubt, named one of the best films out of 2008, from the trailer I could tell this was going to be the ""actor's movie"" of the year for sure. We have power house actors, Meryl Streep, Philipe Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams in the leading roles. I had to see this movie; based on the play, this is a story that remains as controversial today as back then when this screenplay was written. Not to mention the power of doubt, when you are so sure and you want to go with your instincts, but what if everyone around you just kept telling you that you should have doubt? Meryl Streep pulls in one of the best performances of the year as the tough and cocky principal that is so sure that the most loved priest of her school is something horrific.Sister Aloysius, the strict principal of the attached school, discusses a sermon with her fellow nuns. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior to give Father Flynn cause for preaching about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open for any such behavior. Sister James, a young and naive teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only African-American student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call in her class asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of an alcoholic drink on his breath. On guard for unusual behavior, Sister James reveals her suspicions to Sister Aloysius. Sisters Aloysius and James confront Father Flynn with their suspicions that his relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times, Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself but Sister Aloysius persists. The priest relents, revealing that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine. Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius' belief that he has behaved inappropriately with the boy is unshakable.The thing I love about this movie is the screenplay is it's style and human nature, this film captures the morals and ethics of our conscience, how certain we can be without having any proof. One of the performances I felt was a little overlooked was Amy Adams, playing this little naive nun who wants to just be in a happy world where nothing changes or could be bad. But Amy Adams is becoming more of a great actress every time I see her, she reminds me of old Hollywood, she's got a certain perk that she always brings to her role, she spectacular. But of course the great performance goes to big surprise, Meryl Streep, the woman who proves time and time again why she is one of the most critically acclaimed actresses of our time. She was absolutely brilliant and did a great job. Doubt is a good movie, it's an actor's movie like I suspected, because it's the performances that this movie that could have been dull, into a great strong story.7/10",Doubt
37,blanbrn,"Good film of character study helped by the excellent performances from the cast also it leaves the viewer to question religion, morality, and authority.",7,22 February 2009,"""Doubt"" which is based on an award winning play from John Patrick Shanley hits the screen in fine form as the performances from the cast of Streep, Hoffman, Adams, and Davis are excellent. With all the doubts and headlines that religion has made over the years from abuse of powers like money fraud, and most notable child molestation this is certainly a film that can hold water with the current times and state of faith. And it's probably rightfully titled as many still do have doubt in the church.Set in 1964 in the Bronx, New York at a religious school for children you see from the get go how it's ran. It's a strict professional break no rules don't talk out of turn have table manners kind of way. And guiding the ship is the iron fisted Sister Aloysius(as again Meryl proves she can play just about any role)who shares duties as both head sister and principal. Under her wing is the up and coming yet naive young Sister James(Amy Adams)who enjoys her teachings of the young. This film takes a turns when one day suspicion is brought to her attention when she suspects one of her young boys a black student oddly enough who has been approached by the most visible priest of the church that's the vibrant Father Flynn(greatly portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman). As the doubts of sister James ran wild her thoughts are something of doubt, as the film really does such a great job of keeping what occurred hidden was it giving the boy alcohol, a spanking, or something more serious like abuse in a physical or sexual manner. With the attitude of Flynn who knows as it's clear this priest wants more of an open and laid back secular church. As it was fun watching the scenes of him giving the boys advice on dancing with young girls, and his suggestion of adding songs like Frosty the Snowman to the Christmas play as Sister Alosius was against it because Frosty had magic powers! Anyway after Sister James tells of this to Sister Aloysius then as principal she is put on a mission to search for the truth. Some of the scenes between Streep and Hoffman are powerful as Sister Aloysius is tough and aggressive with her questions all the time she tries not to overstep the bounds of authority yet she must fight for the truth as anyone could have a morality problem even Father Flynn. A secret is discovered when Aloysius meets the young black boys mother Mrs. Miller(in a limited yet good supporting turn from Viola Davis)as maybe after all really maybe Father Flynn was just trying to provide some comfort and ease for the boy. Yet that's one thing about this film really as the viewer never really knows, it's appropriately titled as you clearly as a viewer are left with ""Doubt"".Even after the exit of Father Flynn the end scene between Sister James and Sister Aloysius leaves you stunned as you can clearly see Aloysius feels without prove she overstepped her moral grounds as now she really has doubts if authority was abused. Overall ""Doubt"" is a pretty good film one that will leave you thinking about religion, morality, authority, abuse of power, and it shows when all tied together those themes can still produce doubt as clearly this film leaves the viewer to guess as to what happened. It's also a must see for it's character study as that's the films big showcase and the performances make it so intriguing as always Streep is excellent and Hoffman appears to be growing more and more accustomed to playing heavies so well and you add the good supporting performances from Adams and Davis then that makes ""Doubt"" clearly one of the more interesting and thought provoking films that I've seen in a good while.",Doubt
38,DKosty123,Intelligent Well Acted Film,9,31 December 2014,"Turner Classic Movies just ran this overlooked drama for the first time in honor of Philip Seymour Hoffman. This movie is a gem which I believe more people will notice in future years. While the plot looks simple and straight forward it is anything but. All the acting and cast is excellent in this one. What is unique here is the script of this drama.It is written open- ended. I am not sure if it was intended this way though if it was it is as classic as Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt. If you watch this movie with a closed mind, you think it is a neatly tied up bow package and another condemnation of the Catholic Church. Then you get shocked at the end when one of the main characters breaks down and realizes they have made a huge mistake. I want to be careful here and not totally expose this for the viewer but there are several subtle hints of what is going to happen.The sermon's by Hoffman's Priest are a broad hint. A series of physical actions in the movie, one in particular, are not interrupted correctly. While the viewer who is toyed with is led down the garden path of guilt, the church makes a totally different judgment and the viewer has to be extremely bright to understand why.This movie is a terrific example of why Philip Seymour Hoffman has left us too soon. I am thankful he did this drama in 2008 to point that out. In a way the movie is incomplete because one of the kids is being abused at home but because of one of the main character's flaw in logic it is left open to the viewer to figure out what happened to the child after the movie?Terrific well done dramas with open ended plots are not done often enough. I highly recommend people to see a sleeper that deserves more viewing.",Doubt
39,sddavis63,A Troubling Movie That Raises Questions,7,22 August 2009,"After watching this I was left with very mixed feelings and honestly didn't have a clue what to do with it. The story deals with an old school nun (played by Meryl Streep) who is principal of a parish school who, without any real evidence, accuses a priest whom she obviously doesn't like, of sexual misconduct with a student. Essentially that's the story. In that sense, it's simple and straightforward. My first reaction was a sense of relief that in an age when about the only thing we hear about Catholic priests is allegations of sexual misconduct we were essentially being shown a movie about the priest as a victim - except that in this case he's being victimized by a nun. It seems again to be a case (somewhat subtler than some) of the church and/or religion being used as a ""whipping boy."" The message seems to be that the church/religion/religious people cannot be portrayed in a good light. Frankly, I believed Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman.) While he clearly had some personal demon that tormented him, I never believed that he abused the boy. But this movie still comes across as a slam, because of the horrible behaviour of Sister Aloysius, who demonstrates ultimately that she will go to any lengths (honest or not) to destroy this man.That the abuse issue in the Catholic Church is caused by the very structure of the Catholic Church is demonstrated. The extremely hierarchical and secretive nature of the church tends (as we have seen) to insulate the accused behind a protective veil at times. That's pointed out here as Flynn points out to Aloysius that she should be following proper channels in making her accusations. Insisting on the use of proper procedures doesn't mean a priest is guilty, of course. It's the system, but the very system adds to suspicion and gossip. The damage that can be done by unfounded gossip is clearly illustrated by Flynn with the pillow story. I found the reaction of the boy's mother when Aloysius shared her suspicions with her troubling to say the least, and the end of the movie was - to me - a bit empty. Aloysius confesses her doubts to Sister James (Amy Adams.) Doubts about what? Has her belief in Flynn's guilt caused her to doubt her faith? Has the response of the church (simply assigning Flynn to another parish) caused her to doubt the church? Or, is she suddenly admitting doubt about Flynn's guilt and remorse about forcing him out of the parish? Doubt is valuable in a life of faith. Raising questions is what pushes us to grow and ultimately expand our faith, but I still would have liked to have known exactly what her doubts were about. There's also food for thought here about how easy it is for people in certain professions (teacher, clergy, doctor, police, etc.) to be falsely accused and have their reputations destroyed simply because someone decides that they don't like them.I was not overwhelmed by the performances in this movie. Hoffman was good as Flynn, while I had trouble accepting Streep in the role of Aloysius. Amy Adams - with an air of innocence about her - was believable as Sister James, concerned about the boy, concerned about Father Flynn being treated unfairly, concerned about the behaviour of Aloysius, but all the way through seeming confused as to what she should do about it. The movie isn't exciting, but it does raise a lot of questions. For that alone, I give it a 7/10.",Doubt
40,Buddy-51,interesting theme only sporadically well executed,6,5 January 2009,"Strong performances are the saving grace of ""Doubt,"" an otherwise uneven, overly glib tale of possible sexual abuse in one New York City parish circa 1964.Sister Aloysius is a tradition-bound nun who goes through life utterly untroubled by uncertainty or doubt, running her convent and grade school with unyielding self-righteousness and the iron fist of unchallenged authority. Sister Aloysius doesn't take any more kindly to the accoutrements of the modern world - she has banned all ballpoint pens from the premises and decries ""Frosty the Snowman"" as a celebration of pagan magic - than she does to the ""liberalizing"" effect Vatican II has had on the Church she views as the last bastion of morality in an increasingly permissive and immoral world. This puts her in direct conflict with Father Flynn, a reform-minded, man-of-the-people priest who is more concerned with his parishioners' needs than with church ritual per se - yet whom Sister Aloysius has reason to suspect might be a pedophile. Or is she simply targeting the man and seeing what she wants to see because his view of the Church is so at odds with her own? The third main character, Sister James, is a perpetually upbeat but generally naïve novice who becomes more than a disinterested bystander in the war-of-wills that erupts between her two equally hardnosed superiors.In adapting his play to the screen, writer/director John Patrick Shanley hits on some intriguing themes revolving around certainty vs. doubt and traditionalism vs. progressivism, but the movie isn't always as intellectually honest and convincing as one might wish it to be, especially when Shanley indulges in such hokey effects as the winter wind batting against the windows or well-orchestrated thunder bolts crashing overhead at ""meaningful"" moments in the picture. Similarly, the reactions the characters have to one another and the situation they're involved in don't always ring true given the less enlightened time period in which the story takes place. And the final ""transformative"" moment comes upon us with such abruptness and with so little preparation that it quite literally rings down the curtain on the entire enterprise.Yet, despite all these flaws, ""Doubt"" periodically rises to the occasion and does justice to the complexity of its subject matter. This is particularly the case in a searing scene between Sister Aloysius and the mother of one of the boys who may have fallen victim to Father Flynn's inappropriate conduct, a scene that catches us completely off-guard with its sheer unexpectedness and its paradigm-shifting effect on the story.Moreover, the performances are uniformly excellent, starting with Meryl Streep who brings a surprising amount of humor and even warmth to a character who is, for all intents and purposes, cut off from her emotions by her dogmatically rigid nature. Phillip Seymour Hoffman effectively keeps us guessing as to the truth about his character, never tipping his hand one way or the other as to what is taking place in the depths of his soul. Amy Adams makes a compelling stand-in for those of us in the audience who are trying to reserve judgment on these two characters before all the facts are revealed. Special note must also be taken of Viola Davis, superb in her brief but unforgettable appearance as the mother who delivers an unsettling response to news that her son may have been the victim of a sexual predator.The movie seems to suggest that one can never have one hundred percent certitude about anything in this life and that actions must often be taken even when all the ""facts"" in a particular case can never be fully known. Yet, what happens when such an action could result in the destruction of another person's livelihood and reputation? It's an interesting theme that is only sporadically well addressed by ""Doubt,"" but the food-for-thought that the movie provides makes it worth checking out anyway.",Doubt
41,thesar-2,Only Shadow(s) of a Doubt,5,24 January 2009,"The best thing about 'Doubt' was the outstanding performances by the two leads, Meryl Streep and the always, always impressive Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Unfortunately, even for just a 104 minute film, it seems dragged out for 304 minutes, starting off slow and rarely picking up the pace. There were a few good lines, including Hoffman directly criticizing the actually scary, narrow-minded and old-school Principal, Streep (in a word: ""intolerance,"") excellent sets and sometimes unique shots  but not always. I can tilt a camera, but it doesn't make me a genius. Though I loved Hoffman's gossip speech, it isn't at all original. I'm not sure if it's my own religious upbringing or if I've seen in films before, I've heard that metaphor dozens of times. And even then, it certainly does apply here. I work in a call center  and, honestly, that speech should absolutely be in any call center orientation video. As for the 2008 Oscars: What didn't surprise me: no nomination for best picture (it was good, but not great,) that both Streep and Hoffman were nominated. What did surprise me was Viola Davis and Amy Adams both nominated for supporting actress. Yes, they both good, but certainly there were more worthy roles in 2008 and I have heard of the Academy nominating people for 5 minute roles (see: 'Titanic' or 'Shakespeare in Love') but Davis was hardly worth a nod. (Absolute spoiler ahead) As I do like when movies make us think, allow us to make up our own mind (Yep, believe it, I am a fan of 'Basic Instinct' and it's ""make up your own damned mind"" finale) but come on  half the movie flip-flops back and forth without any conclusion.

42,sol-kay,In the pursuit of wrongdoing one steps away from God!,8,11 March 2009,"***SPOILERS*** Taking place in 1964 the film ""Doubt"" has to do with the major changes-during the Second Ecumenical Council- going on in the Catholic Church at that time. This is soon to reflect in the power struggle that's to erupt at the St.Nicholas School in the Bronx between it's old tradition principal Sister Aloysius, Meryl Streep, and the school's modern thinking pastor Father Flynn, Philip Seymour Hoffman.It seems that Sister Aloysius has been having serious doubts about Father Flynn's ability to preform his duties as both the school pastor as well as captain of its basketball team. Hung up on the past Sister Aloysius is also against the students using ballpoint pens to do their schoolwork feeling that it will corrupt their penmanship! It's when Sister James, Amy Adams, reports to Sister Aloysius that one of the students Donald Miller, Joseph Foster, has been acting odd since he was seen in the presence of Father Flynn that she get the idea that the good father has been making uncalled for advances towards Donald.Not giving Father Flynn a chance to explain his relationship with Donald, the only black student in St. Nicholas, Sister Aloysius goes all out to have him dismissed from his job as pastor even to the point of having him defrocked as a priest in the Catholic Church! As the movie later shows Father Flynn did have a special relationship with Donald but not the kind that Sister Aloysius thought it was. Father Flynn's kindness and compassion for the troubled young man was about as Christ-like as one can get. It was just too bad that the mindless and even vindictive, in her attempts to destroy Father Flynn, Sister Aloysius was too blind to see it!When Donald's mother Mrs. Miller, Viola Davis, goes to talk to Sister Aloysius about her son's problems at school she tries to make her feel as if Father Flynn is the cause of them. It doesn't at all concern Sister Aloysius in what Mrs. Miller says about Donald's father who's real psychical abuse of her son is far worse then Sister Aloysius' totally unfounded accusations about Father Fynn's treatment of Donald. As things start getting out of hand it's Sister James who starts to feel guilty in alerting Sister Aloysius on Father Flynn's, in what she thought at the time, inappropriate conduct towards young Donald. It soon becomes evident that Father Flynn was only trying to get Donald to have confidence in himself in order to make his way towards graduating from St. Nicholas the following June. Getting a diploma from the highly regarded private Catholic School would have Donald qualify to get into a much better, and safer, high school then those available to him in the crime and drug ridden South Bronx.****SPOILER ALERT****The films sad and heartbreaking ending is more of a statement on the actions of the bull-headed Sister Aloysius then on those of the kind and compassionate Father Flynn. Sister Aloysius finally did get her way in having Father Flynn, even though he was promoted to another Parrish, removed from St. Nicholas. Not wanting to see the truth in the damage that she caused not just for Father Flynn but young Donald it took Sister James to get Sister Aloysius to finally realize that she wasn't doing God's work in regard to Father Flynn. It's then for the first time in the movie that the so sure of herself Sister Aloysius started to have doubts in when she did! And it's these doubts that will hunt her for the rest of her life!",Doubt
43,Robert_duder,"Brilliant performances, with a dark tale of morality",9,18 May 2009,"A quiet hit last year, and a star of the Academy Awards Doubt looked like it would be a powerful drama and I was right! Perhaps oddly I don't attribute the performances in the same way that some of the critics did and perhaps part of this is personal opinion but I still think the most brilliant performance of all was completely ignored and some of the weakest performances were heralded more than they should have. Doubt is absolutely a character study, the plot is solid but this film revolves and thrives on the characters. They obviously kept much of the style from the original Broadway play which is a good thing and really holds it's own when translated to the big screen. The entire film really only has one basic setting in the church and various offices and most of the dramatic moments come from the scenes where various characters square off of each other and its plainly brilliantly filmed and you will watch with your mouth open it is completely enthralling. The best part of Doubt is just how incredibly intelligent the film is. The incredibly appropriate title doesn't just mean what is happening on screen but what the film will leave with the audience. I will begin with the actors that received a lot of acclaim for this film. First Meryl Streep seemed to be on tip of everyone's tongues for this film and yes she was nominated for yet another Oscar for her role. I personally have always found Streep over hyped given far too much credit for her ability. She has done good work, don't get me wrong, but she often plays the same dreary serious characters and I don't find her all that impressive. She does alright as the powerful nun with a vendetta but she isn't mind blowing by any means and I think her performance is enhanced by her co-stars. Amy Adams is a good actress, and has a talented range of genres. Still I thought her performance in this film was a little over hyped. She does decently as the timid emotional sister but she isn't really a heavy player in the film. Her role is rather small and yet she was so focused on by critics and the Academy as she was nominated for an Academy Award as well. I think perhaps the Academy just loved the film enough that they wanted to reward everyone because even Viola Davis who had a very, very small role warranted a nomination. Finally we come to who I think is the true star of this film. The brilliantly talented Philip Seymour Hoffman is mind blowing as Father Brendan Flynn, accused of misconduct by Streep's character. Hoffman has had many great roles in the last few years and his emotion and powerful ability shines through. When he is on the screen you will be riveted. He also brings out the absolute best in Streep when the two of them face off in a brilliantly written battle of words. A particular scene where the two of them square off in her office marks one of the best scenes in cinema I have ever seen. Perhaps it may sound like I am being harsh to the cast except Hoffman and I don't mean to because they are all great in their roles in this film. I just feel like Streep and Adams particularly got more notice for this film than Hoffman who blows everyone else away.Original writer, screenplay writer, and director John Patrick Shanley obviously is passionate about his own work. He is not a seasoned director, in fact this is his only directorial big screen work in nearly twenty years since Joe vs The Volcano, which isn't exactly in the same genre. Still being the original creator of this brilliant story he obviously knows and has expectations for. He got a solid cast who all worked very hard in their roles and everything just seemed to fit together. Ultimately being a tale of morality and potential corruption it is also a mystery of sorts that will leave you wondering and deciphering all the various clues left by the characters. I formulated my opinion as to whether or not Father Flynn is guilty but in talking to others I know that everyone has different opinions and the case is all laid out. You must see this brilliant, moving, intelligent film!! 9/10",Doubt
44,Lejink,Redoubtable...,8,3 August 2009,"A complex, thought provoking movie as much about guilt and truth as doubt, enhanced by three excellent performances at its heart by its principals. I am aware that this is a film version of a successful play and while it's not hard to guess its theatrical source, pleasingly the movie version has been adapted and directed by its writer, John P Shanley, no doubt enabling him to preserve his version and vision of his play.Set in 1964 Boston, the material's relevance to today is of course heightened by the recent exposure of the much publicised abuse scandal amongst the Boston priesthood against children in their charge, but goes further by putting the viewer firmly in the jury stand and asking us to decide if one-woman judge, jury and symbolic executioner, Meryl Streep, as the stringent Mother Superior of a Boston convent-school has the right to railroad Pater-familias Philip Seymour-Hoffman out of his job over his interest in and attention to a young black student and perhaps others before him.The movie also puts forward themes of family sacrifice, as the young student's mother is shown torn against accepting the abuse in order for her son to get the necessary grades move onto a better school in a few short months, obligations to peer-pressure as inexperienced young Sister James, played by Amy Adams, after initially reporting her suspicions to Streep, finds herself developing a conscience and with it the moral backbone to question Streep's myopic campaign against Hoffman, as well as issues over enlightened education (there's even an amusingly ridiculous argument put up by Streep over the anti-religious sentiment of the song ""Frosty The Snowman""), racial discrimination and school-bullying.The plot, whilst very much a variation on Miller's ""The Crucible"" is well drawn out, with just enough doubt portrayed in Hoffman's behaviour, to make you think that where there is smoke there could be fire, a doubt of course, shored up by the fact that we know of the guilt of the Boston priesthood in this era of just the abuses Streep's character suspects. For instance, even though Streep's initial suspicions are based on a seemingly harmless exchange in the playground between Hoffman and rebellious white schoolboy Jimmy Hurley (before the flames are fanned by Sister James' reported suspicions over Hoffman's taking in hand of the more sensitive and vulnerable black boy Donald Miller), there is a scene later on in the gym where Jimmy again recoils from Hoffman's outstretched hand, making you just wonder if there is something going on now or has been in the past between them. Or is just that he's offended by Hoffman's female-length fingernails...?Nevertheless, Streep's unyielding harridan, hooded almost entirely throughout like the symbolic black-crow later referred to by Hoffman in a conversation with Adams, is obviously building her case on a sandy foundation, culminating in her bluff to Hoffman during their key confrontation on a fiction that she has spoken anonymously to an accusatory nun at a previous school from which Hoffman has moved on. And yet again, why doesn't Hoffman's character doesn't take her on, if he's so sure of his innocence, instead yielding to her diktat and resigning his post...and why does he move on with such regularity...? Doubts again...The acting here is uniformly good. Good to see Streep back doing serious acting after moonlighting in froth such as ""Mamma Mia"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Hoffman, is a fine foil to her in a carefully modulated performance, shocked at the seriousness of the career-threatening allegations against him but ultimately powerless to appeal to Streep's (in)humanity. Amy Adams is also very good in this heavyweight company as the mouse that finally roars and extracts from iron-willed Streep her closing confession of doubt. There's also a fine supporting performance by Oprah Winfrey lookalike Viola Davis as Donald's anguished mother.The direction is largely effective although sometimes too obvious imagery is employed (I'm thinking of the ""million feathers"" scene used to illustrate Hoffman's sermon on gossip). The dialogue throughout is intelligently written, redolent of Pinter at times, thoroughly idiomatic and expertly delivered by the cast. The children all act very well too by the way.Overall then, a well-argued and cunningly written piece, brought convincingly and intelligently to the screen.",Doubt
45,ElMaruecan82,"""One must step away from God to prevent a wrongdoing""",8,11 December 2020,"""And God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually""By turning a Catholic school in the Bronx into one of the realms of men's wickedness, ""Doubt"" seems to establish an ironic truth which is that the closer to God, the more capable we are to spot the wrongdoings of men even in their slightest expressions. Clearly, there's something rotten in St. Nicholas that is never totally revealed, which makes it all the more disturbing because it invites the imaginations of our own thoughts.It's because men can envision evil that things such as gossips and suspicion can prevail, but like the school principal Sister Beauvier (Meryl Streep) would say: one should take a step away from God to prevent a wrongdoing, I got the meaning or I think I did: if hell is paved with his good intentions, the road to heaven is sinuous and can't do without ethical shortcuts. There is a meteorological leitmotif consisting of a sweeping wind taking everyone off guard, you'll notice that whenever there's a confrontation between Sister Beauvier and Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), it's like God wheezing his own anger toward his subjects.Or is is it the wind of change incarnated by the reforms of Vatican II? The film opens with a preach about uncertainty: following the death of Kennedy and in the infancy of the Vietnam War, American hearts were haunted by the ghost of disillusion and fear. Flynn, using his prose and charisma, embraced the change, much to the reluctance of the more conservative Beauvier. Adapting his own Pullitzer-winning play, John Patrick Shanley confronts two opposite forces one to another: liberal and conservative, both incarnated by two powerful figures and with a reputation-shaming scandal as both the backdrop and the ""x"" in the equation.Sister Beauvier is the iron lady who wouldn't hesitate to rebuke misbehavior using a firm tap on a kid's shoulder and forcing her subordinate nuns to have frugal meals but empathetic enough to cover a Sister whose senility and blindness might cause her expelling. Her intolerance is only superficial. However, Father Flynn is more charismatic more prone to lead his school by insufflating the air of modernity. He smokes, drinks, doesn't mind the use of secular songs for Christmas but that's a façade as well, he also grew a certain liking on one altar boy named Donald Miller, the only African-American member of the school.The suspicion doesn't begin when the young teacher Sister James (Amy Adams) notices a few troubling signs about Donald after seeing Flynn, but from the very start when he offers him a little toy. Maybe it's because we, modern audience, do understand the meaning of such a gesture after the scandals that soiled the reputation of Catholics schools, but Shanley (who based the play from his own childhood) never lets the material fall in the ""howcatchem' type of intrigue. Doubt is essential because we have to question our own certainties first and let the characters lay their cards. Had Flynn been played as a villain, the purpose would have failed.And so ""Doubt"" features the overarching conflict between two persons whose difference deepen over the course of the film driving each one to one extreme for the corner, the question is: who's gonna get in the corner? A character like the sweet Sister James (to which the film is dedicated) is crucial because she's as close to Sister Beauvier as she's respectful towardf Flynn. She doesn't believe in his guilt but isn't it a way to preserve her faith in men's goodness? The moment she snaps at a kid, she's guilt-ridden and gets instantly back to her benevolence. Maybe she wants to stick to her innocence for the sake of her own beliefs and maybe she caught the attention of Sister Beauvier because she knew she could manage it.For its minimalist approach, ""Doubt"" could only depend on the actors' sincerity. On that level, the film contains some of the best acting ever, with four performances that earned Oscar nominations. Streep once again proves her unique talent in nuances and subtle displays of weaknesses even in her most impressively strong characters, the late Hoffman is equally mesmerizing as the man of power whose confidence is slowly eroded by the subtle grilling of Sister Beauvier, until he looks like a little boy who tries to find the right expression to inspire pity. And Adams is just irresistible as the young and idealistic Sister James torn between duty and a devotion that hides a fear of a discovering a truth she couldn't handle.It all leads us to the confrontation with the mother, one that would contradict all expectations. As Mrs. Miller, Viola Davis gives a pivotal performance as the mother of a boy, capable to handle that ugly truth because she figures it's the lesser of so many evils that can strike Donald. Her dialogue with the Sister is shocking but it has one merit; it is heartfelt and honest and she's perhaps the only character of the film who's got the luxury of certitudes no matter how disturbing they are. For her ten minutes of screen-time, Viola Davis made the fourth acting Oscar-nomination of the film.The scene with Mrs. Miller is followed by the ultimate interrogation whose merit is less in the end than the means to achieve them, as impenetrable as God's ways. That scene isn't the real climax because it's only when sighs of relief are possible that Sister Beauvier finally shares with Sister James a moment of true sincerity that indicates what doubt is: that feeling of powerlessness in the belief that there's a power to depend on, not an institution, and that conscience might be our only bond with God.Yes, compassion does exist for as long as someone is sincerely regretful... but can you ever reach a man's heart? not to mention the thoughts that go with it.",Doubt
46,MOscarbradley,Keeping the faith.,9,8 March 2009,"The problem I have in reviewing ""Doubt"" is that if I say what the film is 'about', or rather what I personally perceive the film to be about, (it is, thankfully, open to interpretation), then I feel I am giving away the denouement. It isn't a thriller per se but this psychological battle-of-wills does pose at least one fundamental question - why? And if we can answer that to our satisfaction then we can sleep peacefully in the knowledge that we have solved the mystery. And the mystery is simply - why? Of course, that is reducing John Patrick Shanley's very fine play and this superb film of it, which he has adapted and directed himself, to the simplistic level of a conventional thriller and ""Doubt"" is so much more than that.By now most people will know it's about a priest suspected of having an improper relationship with a young (black) boy by a particularly ferocious nun, (the boy's colour is significant). It is fundamentally a four-handed character piece where the motives of the characters and the intricacies of their lives become much more significant to the development of the film's plot than the mere question of 'did-he-or-didn't-he'. If ""Doubt"" finally lacks something as a drama it's that Shanley, the dramatist, is posing a few too many questions without ever providing the answers. It's one thing working things out for yourself; it's quite another in having an author who tries to put all the questions he can think of into the mix without actually seeming to know the answers himself or at least giving them to his audience.""Doubt"", then, is something of an over-egged pudding but it is also that rarest of beasts, a popular entertainment that actually makes its audience think and more significantly, debate. You could hardly call it a failure in that respect. It is also a terrific actor's piece and it is blessed by four terrific actors. One of life's great pleasures is watching Meryl Streep 'perform' in a piece of work worthy of her talents, (which hasn't always been the case in recent years). As the formidable Sister Aloysius, ('the dragon is hungry today' Father Flynn says as she drags another pupil to her office), she is simply magnificent. OK, once or twice she goes over-the-top in a bravura display of histrionics but mostly she burrows deep inside the character's skull to come up with a living, breathing and very human being. This is great acting from probably the world's greatest actress and it's great precisely because she lays bare all of her character's contradictions. The highest praise I can bestow on her is that there is more of Sister Aloysius here than there is of Meryl.She doesn't have it all her own way, though. As Father Flynn, Philip Seymour Hoffman confirms his position as probably the best actor working in movies today. Like Streep, he finds the core of his character yet this is a very difficult role to play. Flynn must remain an enigma while at the same time be utterly real. Hoffman nails him.There are two other great performances. Amy Adams may have the most difficult role as the young nun who first suspects Father Flynn. Superficially naive and innocent, (I don't think she quite comprehends what it is she is comprehending), Adams has to bring layers and shadings to Sister James in order that we may watch her grow and develop. I think Shanley has under-written the part, (she disappears for a time mid-way through the film as if her character had somehow become redundant), but Adams fleshes her out and finds a life in the character the author seems to have ignored.Viola Davis as the mother of the boy who may or may not have been abused is only in the film for one short scene but she almost steals the film, (and for that one, short scene she steals the film from her co-star, Meryl Streep). It is through her character that the film's 'mysteries' are finally revealed. Davis may only have that one scene but she knows she has the best 10 minutes or so in the picture and she grabs it with both hands. Oscars have been won for less.As a director Shanley las a lot to learn. The material, (and the performances), are powerful enough to speak for themselves without the need for thunderstorms, swirling leaves and exploding light-bulbs. Despite being mentioned in dispatches this isn't a movie about the Devil but rather about ordinary and very flawed people attempting to understand and come to terms with their own humanity. As such, it is a considerable success.",Doubt
47,MLDinTN,too boring for me,3,22 November 2009,"There's not much to the plot of this movie and it never even answers the main question it's asking. Did Father Flynn do anything improper with one of his alter boys? Meryl Streep plays the school's principle and she's the one leading the witch hunt to get rid of Father Flynn. She's presented very, very vague evidence by one of her nuns: That the boy in question was called by Flynn to his office and came back to class acting strange by laying his head down and had alcohol on his breath; the other thing was the nun saw Flynn putting an undershirt in the boy's locker. Apparently that's all you need to know to accuse a priest of wrong doing.Sure, the acting performances were good. The problem was they had very little to do and it just wasn't interesting.FINAL VERDICT: I only recommend it if you want to be put to sleep.",Doubt

This film is an acting powerhouse and features some of the best acting you'll ever see. Also, this film is a hot commodity because of the Catholic abuse scandal which happened around the time of this film's release. The movie itself is well-written and very engaging despite some over-stretched scenes.John Patrick Shanley's film is about a fear-inspiring nun who is a principal at a Catholic school/church and she has suspicions arise when she discovers that a priest, Father Flynn has taken a special interest in a 12-year-old boy.This film features some outstanding acting by Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis. The scene with Streep battling it out with Hoffman is a very powerful one as well as the scene involving both Streep and Davis. All four of these actors deserve their Oscar nominations.Overall, this is a powerful, engaging film that is relevant to the news of today. The story is a great hook, but the acting carries the film.

49,Irishchatter,"Good film with Streep,Seymour Hoffman and Adams",8,30 April 2017,"You honestly wouldn't think of Meryl Streep acting as a tough nun and knew what went on. She really did a good job on her performance and like, her character was so strong that she was able to identify what went on with the late Philip Seymour Hoffman's character getting involved with the black student. From looking at Hoffman's character in my personal opinion, definitely did sexually abuse the boy because of the way the priest always wanted him in his office and that he did seem rather touchy. I know that the author who wrote the book only told Seymour Hoffman if his character was actually guilty or not for rape. I doubt the author would tell anyone else to be honest for a very long time. Amy Adams was good in this too, she really knows how to play the sweet teacher. Its hard to not get rid of the fact she was sort of a Disney princess when she played Giselle in ""Enchanted"". I just think of her as a princess in a nun's costume haha. Seriously tho, she is a pretty brilliant actress as well as the rest who were involved in this! I give this movie 8/10!",Doubt
50,inkblot11,"No doubt whatsoever, this is a great film, tackling great issues, with a great, great cast",10,4 January 2009,"In 1964, in a Catholic school in New York, Sister T-Rex, oh pardon me, Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) rules her small world as the academy's principal. She keeps everyone in line, bopping children on the heads if they fall asleep in church and handing out severe punishments for those who talk in class. To the other nun-teachers of the school, including sweet, kindhearted Sister James (Amy Adams), Sister A is also their domineering leader and they do as she wishes, most circumstances. Into the middle school comes a seemingly pleasant priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who conducts phys ed classes and counsels the student body. His personality is the polar opposite of Sister A's but there is little friction between the two. This academic year, however, there is also another change, as the school has accepted its first black student, Dennis. Dennis adores Father Flynn and, under the priest's guidance, is one of the parish's altar boys. One day, loving Sister James is unwittingly a witness to what she comes to believe is a sexual overture from Father Flynn to Dennis. Alerting Sister A of her suspicions, the younger nun watches as the older and more powerful sister becomes obsessed with finding the truth about the situation. Can Sister A get Father Flynn to confess his sins, if, indeed, there has been an inappropriate nature to his friendship with Dennis? This is an amazing film and it should be on everyone's ""must-see"" list, even if one believes, as I did, that the story seems like a downer. In truth, the tale has many humorous moments, for Sister A has a sharp, stinging wit and Father Flynn, too, has some ironically funny comments to make. But, first things first. The cast here is beyond measure in its greatness. Hoffman shows none of his own sardonic, caustic commentary, for his Father Flynn is a genuinely ""nice"" human being, without a touch of nastiness or sarcasm. Adams, too, is wonderful as the nun with a giant heart. As for Streep, it is, without a doubt, one of her best performances ever, for she sinks her teeth into her meaty, powerful role with relish. The lesser performers, including Alice Drummond, are also quite fine. Then, too, the re-creation of the world of a 1960's Catholic school is breathtakingly real and jarring, for some of us know little or nothing of such things. Compliments can also be extended to the costume designer, the cinematographer, and the production crew. As for Shanley, the writer and director, what a tour de force he has created! His tale takes on everything, religion, race, sexuality, love, gender, and more while, most importantly, leaving the viewer to make his or her own final analysis of the situations presented. Brilliant, utterly brilliant, are the only words that spring to mind. Therefore, without a doubt, make plans to see this one, especially with a group of friends, family, or even church members, Catholic or not. This is a story that will have everyone enthralled and, after the film's conclusion, talking for hours and hours.",Doubt
51,ironhorse_iv,"No doubt about it. This movie was one of the best Church dramas, I ever saw.",8,13 December 2015,"This American drama film adaptation of John Patrick Shanley's 2004's Pulitzer Prize winning stage play, 'Doubt: A Parable' was well-deserving of all the Oscar praise, it got in 2008. Set in 1964 Brooklyn, the film directed by the same author, tells the story of harden, Catholic school principal, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), challenging and questioning Father Brendan Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman)'s ambiguous relationship with a troubled young student, Donald Miller (Joseph Foster). Can, Father Flynn fight against the allegations of sexual abuse claims that Sister Aloysius is spitting out, or will her inappropriate claims have some truth to the matter? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I like the fact, that the movie never truly, bring closure to the main conflict. That's a pretty brave statement for the filmmakers to make with this film. When the novel first came out; it was during the height of infamous sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston, John Patrick Shanley could easily wrote that Father Flynn was guilty of the crimes and people would easily be happy with the results. Instead, Shanley makes us think, deep about it. You really don't know, if Father Flynn had sexual relationship with the minor or not. You just have to judge, for yourself, what the film events is trying to show you. This movie doesn't treat its audiences like wolves or sheep. That's one thing that I love about the film; you're left with a thought-provoking decision. I have to say, this film is one of the better scripts, I have ever readt about the controversial subject. Most of the scenes, and dialogue works so well. And just when you think the film is just only about pedophilia. The film works in social commentary about homosexuality, race relations and most of all, how the church should be ran. A lot of the film, focus on the tension between the friendly progressive social changes, that Father Flynn has been promoting for; against that, of the strict-religionist traditional values of what Sister Aloysius is trying to keep. The film pushes this theme even further: at one point, we see the nuns run by Sister Aloysius glumly eating nothing, but a traditional sparse meal, interspersed with shots of Father Flynn and his bishop having a jolly gluttony full dinner. While, it might seem like Sister Aloysius & Father Flynn are one-dimensional conservative vs liberal stereotypes in the trailer, the film further blurs the lines, when it, introduce the women rights factor. While, Father Flynn seem very liberal to everything, around him. One thing, he's very traditional with, is how he assumes that the nuns are there to serve him. Having Sister Aloysius being the first woman in her church, to test the power of the priest is a very interesting viewpoint; because at the time, it was always the male-control upper management of the church that always, had the last say in the matter. This shows the huge changes that was happening at the church, at the time. Indeed, 1964, was a huge year for social changes within the church, as more women were allowed, more freedom of speech, due to actions of the Second Vatican Council meeting. I think, this is another reason why this film works so well. While, Sister Aloysius seem unfriendly, unforgiving, cold, and cynical; she does somewhat care about the safety of her students. You really don't know, if she's the hero or the villain in this story. Meryl Streep gives a great performance as the lead. She matches very well against, the charming, yet darkly mysterious, Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I love Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance in this. His character is charming and straight-forward, it's a lot better than his last performance as a preacher in 2003's Cold Mountain. That version of a priest was way too-over-the-top & cartoony. Anyways, their intense chemistry, together is well-balanced. Another person that really shine in the film was Viola Davis in her very short-supporting role as Donald Miller's mother. Wow, the caliber of talent, within this actress was amazing! It's really surprised me, on how great her scene was with Streep. The only actor, I was somewhat disappointed with, was Amy Adams as Sister James. She was alright, but very forgettable, compare to the others in this film. Despite that, the film's four main actors were heavily praised for their acting, and all of them were nominated for Oscars at the 81st Academy Awards. It's very rare to see that, these days. I have to agree with the Oscars. While, the dialogue scenes were indeed extremely lengthy. Most of the conversations between the actors in the film, were hardly, boring or slow. Yet, there are some faults in other sides of production. The film is a bit heavy-handed when it comes to the camera and its direction. The movie really wants to make sure, its audience understand, the gloomy atmosphere of the story. Shots of the wind-spun leaves, lashing rain, dreary skies, makes this film, somewhat depressing to watch. There's hardly any humor or lighten moment to keep the audience from feeling sick to their stomach. Another thing that was annoying is how the movie overplayed the Dutch angles shot. We get it, filmmakers. You want to depict madness, unrest, and disorientation themes. Enough with the Dutch angles shots. Overall: Doubt is the most thoughtful movie of that year. Its provocative portrayal of doubt and certainty is timely, penetrating, and deeply provocative. Doubt is a must-see movie — and I am completely certain, you'll enjoy it. No doubt about it.",Doubt

While his direction is fine for the most part, Shanley does go a bit overboard with tilted camera angles. Streep, Hoffman, and Adams are excellent. Her performance starts off as somewhat of a caricature, but Streep ultimately presents a memorable portrait of a concerned school principal. Hoffman excels in the difficult role of the suspected child molester, striking the right balance between despicable and sympathetic. Adams is quite likable as the teacher who avoids confrontations but finds herself drawn into the scandal.",Doubt
53,johnnyboyz,Effective dramatic weight executed rather well twinned with tough subject matter handled superbly.,7,9 December 2009,"Doubt made me recall something American film director Woody Allen said a few years ago, during an interview with a British critic, regarding cinema as a spectacle. His speakings revolved around how an individual facial expression when testing times and all round tensions are at an extreme high; or the body language and the manner in which people react to certain things can be just as awe-inspiring, if not more awe-inspiring, than items such as an action set piece or a similar explosive scenario. Doubt is a film that grabs you with its claws and unleashes several proverbial explosive set-pieces of dramatic awe; as situations and altercations play out in a 1960s New York set Catholic school.The film revolves around three distinct and quite frightening scenes; the most effective of which is the one in which assumptions and suspicions are first made aware to certain third parties. The other two are dialogue driven sequences between this third party individual and each singular person of the accusing side; although later on, the chief antagonist of this 'side' will engage in a long, drawn out and very revealing conversation with a mother of a certain character which carries its own revelations. One scene relies on tension and build up; one delivers a verbal jousting complete with bizarre and disorientating camera angles while another carries a certain shock value. Each of these scenes are well spaced around a film that sees steady build up; attention to character traits and flaws more-so development as well as an excellent technical side of things, driven by a superb capturing of an era under the watchful eye of Roger Deakins.The three chief forces of Doubt are two nuns and a priest; the nuns of whom one is young and you feel means well, while the other is elder, more experienced although far less lenient. They are Sister James (Adams) and Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Streep), respectively. Their suspicions and theories of wrong-doing are aimed at a certain Father Flynn, a priest at the congregation who is suspected of paedophilia when an alter-boy named Donald (Foster), the only African-American in the school, returns from his quarters and acts in an odd manner. This is spotted by Sister James who promptly informs Beauvier of the situation which in turn leads to all manner of dramatic, potentially explosive events.So the premise is set between these three parties; one of whom is certain of something despite not actually witnessing it herself and this is only after she is informed by someone else, whose ability to spot these things we perhaps do not entirely trust. Included with this is a man in the middle of it all, the sort that sees the film take time to establish as quite kind; knowing and understanding and whose affection towards God sees him jot down any number of ideas for sermons throughout the day so that he may always have something interesting to talk of in the house of God when the time arrives.The film actually begins with a church-set sermon; laying out some general themes to us, the audience, as we watch on from the somewhat distanced boundaries of the church pews in which everybody sits. The ideas are on that of instincts; first impressions and what to do in times of crisis, promptly setting up what it is people are to go through in the film. Our attention is on Flynn for a while, before we are dragged away by the actions of Sister Beauvier; as she berates a number of children for not giving their complete attention.Writer-director John Patrick Shanley takes time to establish Beauvier as this eagle-eyed and strict observer of the children; confiscating items and picking out children for beration as a result of things so much as slouching. On one occasion, a pupil makes very slight contact with another Sister and is dragged of by Beauvier for whatever punishment lies in wait. The games Shanley plays with us continue when James' own skills of observation, specifically towards her respective pupils, are called into question by Beauvier who promptly installs a reflective item onto the wall so that she can observe them when her back's turned.With all this content of watching; observing; picking people out and berating them for what they've done, driven by Beauvier, it's easy to forget it is James who picks up on the event that drives the entire film; the one whom needed help in her initial skills of spotting behaviour in the first place.The film is a cinematic game of sorts between these three people. Our loyalties towards these characters and who we trust ourselves more than the others are pushed to their limits. Amy Adams' Sister James is quick to accuse, but during the mentioned scene in which Flynn is confronted and tells us what ""actually"" happened, she is quick to backtrack and admit a mistake – is she really able to come to a stone-wall judgement if she is quick to accept the ""truth""? Shanley's execution of the scene that acts as the spark to the entire narrative carries something special, as if you know something's afoot. The suspension in waiting for Sister James to arrive and the further building of the predicament with the serving of teas heightens tension. The Sisters' notion that they are all present in the first place to discuss the Christmas pageant is a further addition to the film's overall theme of supposed innocence on the surface, with raw and unhinged subject material lurking beneath. Shanley implements some crafty red herrings to further our sub-conscience verdict that he simply 'must' be guilty; items such as the fact it's a black student (himself a victim, at home) who is at the centre of it all, and that Flynn himself takes charge of gym class during which most of the boys are engaging in physical activity in whatever loose clothing they wear. Doubt is a really engaging and taut film.",Doubt
54,filipemanuelneto,"A good story, but one that never seemed believable enough.",8,9 August 2021,"I confess that I had no idea what I was going to see when I picked up this movie. I have to start by saying that I am a Catholic, a practitioner, and my work puts me in direct contact with the priests and the church, so this is an environment I know reasonably well. And what I saw in this movie is truly good, and to me, it's a story that almost sounds believable... and I'm going to explain why that doesn't happen.The story begins in a Catholic college, where a superior nun imposes a rigorous, and sometimes retrograde, discipline and organization. In fact, the passage of time and the demands of modernity impose themselves, but she doesn't want to hear them. Despite her severity, she truly believes she does what's right for her students, and she cares about them. And that care will lead her to investigate the community priest, who is her hierarchical superior, when she senses that his affection for one of the students is going beyond the limits of normality.The script is really good, and the whole story is engaging and works well. However, there are things that really didn't convince me, especially as I am a person who knows the ins and outs of the Church well. Starting, from the outset, with the inquisitive and intimidating attitude of that nun towards a priest. She has no proof, she doesn't know what really happened, she's just guessing, and he's on the defensive when he could perfectly well demand hard evidence or threaten her with a serious conversation with the local bishop. In real life, I don't see this happening at all. What's more: the film never makes it clear to us whether there really was an improper relationship between the priest and the young student... this is on purpose, I understand the intent, but it's an annoying dramatic feature.The strong point of the film, and I think this is something that everyone will agree on, is the cast and the way it behaves and works. The film is a nest of stars, full of well-known and extremely competent actors, giving their best and providing us with performances that are, in a word, extraordinary. The highlight goes, of course, to Meryl Streep, an actress who already has such a cinematic record that this film becomes a minor work, without this meaning that it is a less remarkable work. She's almost always fine, and when she's not (I would negatively highlight the final scenes of the film, totally at odds with everything we've seen before) I'd say it's the fault of the script and the material received. Philip Seymour Hoffman also shone in the role of priest, and Amy Adams looked credible as an emotional young nun. Far less interesting, the role of Viola Davis seems to me to have been overvalued. She's good, but she hardly appears in the movie apart from a single dialogue.Technically, it's a low-key movie. A restrained but competent cinematography, discreet but effective directing and editing. The film has good sets and costumes, and the period environment is recreated convincingly and realistically enough. The soundtrack doesn't stand out either. The space is entirely up to the actors to shine.",Doubt
55,howard.schumann,Avoids easy answers,9,22 December 2008,"According to a report commissioned by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, over four thousand clerics were accused of sexual abuse during the past fifty years. Although approximately thirty percent of these accusations were not investigated because they were unsubstantiated, given the proclivity of the bishops to cover up these incidents, the figures are widely suspected to be underestimated. What may be lost in the discussion of statistics about sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, however, is an understanding of the humanity of the people involved or the complexities of the circumstances.This factor is brought to light in Doubt, John Patrick Shanley's filmed version of his Tony Award and Pulitzer Prize winning stage play. Based on Shanley's personal experiences at Catholic School, the film explores not only the issue of possible sexual abuse but conservative versus progressive religious values and how far one can rely on suspicion in the absence of proof. Set in 1964, one year after the Kennedy assassination, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep) is the dragon lady of St. Nicholas school in the Bronx. A strict taskmaster, she relishes her role as the upholder of tradition, rejecting such modern devices as ballpoint pens and the singing of secular songs at Christmas like Frosty the Snowman which she equates with pagan magic.Under Aloysius is the sweet and innocent Sister James (Amy Adams) whose easy going manner and charming personality is a welcome antidote to her authoritarian superior. The priest at St. Nicholas is Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is the closest thing to a progressive at the school. He is open to new ideas and the changes initiated by Pope John XXIII, being much more open and relaxed with the children and engaging them in sports and conversation. In his sermons he brings the language of religion into the twentieth century, talking about the positive aspects of doubt and the injurious effects of gossip. ""Doubt"", he says, ""can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty. When you are lost, you are not alone."" Resentful of the role of women in the Catholic Church and suspicious of Father Flynn, Sister Aloysius assigns Sister James to keep an eye peeled for anything unusual in his conduct. Her fears appear justified when Sister James reports that Father Flynn asked Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II), the school's only African-American student, to a private conference in the rectory and was seen hanging up the boys undershirt in his locker. Sister James also informs her that there was alcohol on the boy's breath and that the boy seemed upset when returning to his desk.Although no inappropriate behavior was witnessed, Sister Aloysius suspects wrongdoing and summons the priest to her office on the pretext of discussing the Christmas pageant. She accuses the priest of misconduct with the altar boy who denies that he gave altar wine to the boy or that anything unusual happened. The drama takes more twists and turns, especially when Donald's mother (Viola Davis) raises Aloysius' eyebrows by suggesting that, in spite of the allegations, the boy, who is due to enter high school in a few months, may be better off in the hands of the priest than having to face his intolerant and abusive father.Doubt avoids easy answers and challenges us to view inflammatory issues from a broader perspective, embracing the essential mystery of human behavior. The acting in the film is uniformly brilliant. Streep is mesmerizing, even if at times more theatrical than may be necessary for the character. Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is more restrained and draws our sympathy with his broader view of church doctrine and display of love and compassion, although his demeanor at the end tantalizingly suggests remorse.What may be the most noteworthy performance, however, is that of Viola Davis whose dialogue with Aloysius is one of the dramatic high points of the film. The issue of whether Father Flynn acted as a friend and mentor to the boy or a sexual partner is ultimately left to the viewer to resolve, though what is beyond doubt is that absolute certainty without considering other points of view is a dead end for all involved.",Doubt
56,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Tremendous cast and a good adaptation keep the richness of ""Doubt"" alive",8,11 June 2009,"Doubt is the antithesis of faith, which is the foremost idea upon which the Catholic Church stands. A fitting title, then, for a drama surrounding scandal in a Catholic school. But it's also fitting because doubt is also a concept, a feeling and the story of ""Doubt"" plays on these feelings, it's richness lying in depth of character and morally ambiguous themes. It's tendency to annoy the audience is more fitting for the patience of theatre-goers, hence why it was a Tony award-winning play previously, but as a film it shines through its top-notch cast and takes on a relatively new spirit.John Patrick Shanley, author of the four-person play, took on the task of adapting his work for the screen and even going so far as to direct it. Shanley's experience writing for film, namely his Academy Award-winning script for 1987's ""Moonstruck,"" proves essential to the success of this endeavor. Unlike many playwrights adapting their own work, Shanley opens his mind and is able to expand ""Doubt"" for a cast including children and many more nuns. Although he could have found ways to use this bigger portrait of Catholic school life to expound deeper meaning unto his story, it's enough to stimulate the shorter attention span of movie audiences and serves this award-winning dialogue quite well.Set in a Catholic school in the Bronx is 1964, ""Doubt"" begins with a portrait of three characters: Father Flynn (Hoffman), a loving friend and father figure as the only male in the school; Sister Aloysius (Streep) the strict and deeply convicted principal of the school and Sister James (Adams) the quiet and naive 8th grade teacher. When Sister James notices something strange with one boy, the only black child in the school who's been particularly close with Father Flynn, she tells Sister Aloysius, who believes despite no proof that something inappropriate is happening and vows to unearth the truth.Without much else happening, these characters are essential to the welfare of the film. Therefore, what better hands than Hoffman, Adams and especially Ms. Oscar herself, Streep? Whether playing characters of moral certainty or emotional doubt, they are all excellent. Viola Davis as the boy's mother also brings incredible emotion to a very critical turn in the film, so much so that she actually manages to upstage Streep -- not an easy feat. Streep gives Sister Aloysius the unflinching character yet also a brittle layer below the surface. Hoffman makes Father Flynn a naturally compassionate figure who despite his newfound beliefs starts to buckle under the microscope of Aloysius. Adams too channels what made her so lovable in ""Enchanted"" into a character of such impeccable innocence. Most cast lists blow you away because they have six or seven major names attached, but ""Doubt"" fills flawlessly the only four it has to give.""Doubt"" is a tough film because it demands of its audience, it wants a multitude of interpretations and cares much less about the insights it provides the audiences than it does the insights the audience discovers on its own. This makes it tough for film, but this cast does it as best as anyone could, probably better. Only Shanley struggles in slight ways. It's not enough to just adapt the play successfully, you have to use the medium to bring more to the story. Shanley helps the story come across beautifully, but he doesn't add -- the metaphors, for example, don't carry the same weight. Still, if you can step away from your own biases and that craving for concrete resolution, it won't be hard to see why ""Doubt"" is a great title and a great story.",Doubt
57,jzappa,Adaptation is a Funny Thing.,9,28 December 2008,"When I saw John Patrick Shanley's one-act play Doubt at Playhouse in the Park about a year before this film was released, I watched Sister Aloysius, an infectiously wry, apparently cold, frigidly strict veteran nun, a woman who is startling when she raises her voice because she otherwise speaks with a dubiously low volume. As one would expect, I thought that if this play were ever made into a movie, this role would have to go to no other than Meryl Streep. Almost a year later, I sat in the AMC theater at Newport on the Levee seeing just that.This Catholic parable walks a tightrope in so many different ways. Its dialogue narrowly balances razor-sharp wit and occasional humor with worrying allusions and challenging moral and philosophical questions. The tone of the play by a hair's breadth maintained equilibrium between the social acceptance, especially given the time and place it portrayed, of a black and white categorization of right and wrong and the individual perspective of the ethical dichomoty of nearly everything. It was the tightly controlled grey-area realism of the story that made me so intensely involved, invested greatly in the outcome of each character, those both on and off stage.The adaptation, in spite of being by the original writer himself, who also directs, elaborates outside of Sister Aloysius's office and the clandestine urban antiquity of the courtyard just outside of it. There is a beautiful rendering of the 1960s Bronx and the community of this church's parish and its elementary school. There is a routine of which we become aware, and though this is so atmospherically effective that those who haven't seen the play before will enjoy the film even more because of it, the play's theatrical intensity bottled the characters' ardor even more, and more opaquely hid us from the tangible truth.""What do you do when you're not sure?"" Philip Seymour Hoffman asks his congregation, opening the story by establishing skepticism and an uncertainty of principles. He delivers another in his series of explosive and affecting performances as Father Flynn, the endeared pastor to whose principles and minor tastes Sister Aloysius of the Order of Sisters of Charity tends to object. In her somewhat amusing means of disciplining the children, she asserts that her students not be spoiled. Flynn, following the Second Vatican Council's decree, considers the clergy more approachable to the parish, which should be seen as family.These two attitudes come into outspoken disagreement when Aloysius suspects Flynn of imposing himself upon the school's first black student. Charm that has not been lost in the story's transition between mediums is in the dialogue, where Shanley and his characters have a conscious understanding with the audience that the full extent of her suspicion, in such a setting, was only acceptable to be vocalized in so many terms.Amy Adams may have yet to maintain the caliber and intimidating capacity to be fully engulfed in the intensity of her characters as are world-class maestros Streep and Hoffman, but she is nonetheless wholly absorbing as Sister James, a very naïve but wholehearted young nun who has been a distant observer to the exchanges concerning Flynn and the student. When James unwillingly testifies to smelling alcohol on the student's breath after seeing Flynn, she instigates the story's fundamental conflict into drive, instilling true begrudging thoughts in us. The student's mother, played with profound humility by Viola Davis, presents yet another perspective, quite an unexpected one, as we feel we can assume judgment on the situation just like Aloysius and we, like her, are suddenly changed when the mother is brought in to talk about the situation with her.Nevertheless, when I saw the play, its director applied a rhythm that stayed one step ahead of you. In a way, Doubt was a two-act play. One act was what one saw on stage, and the other act played out in your thoughts afterward. The movie, with Shanley himself at the helm, did not quite share that plus. There were a few moments at which I thought, ""Are we here already?"" But the power and universal identity of his themes remain: Is there a definitive right and wrong? Is there such a thing as a situation or an issue that has a thorough effect in either of those two directions? The story's conclusion involves deeds portrayed as right that are unethical, and vice versa. It's not a morality tale. It's the very opposite, yet it has the same truth-seeking result.",Doubt
58,Chris Knipp,Powerful hints put you in a state of moral confusion,8,29 December 2008,"'Doubt' takes us into the narrow but intense world of a Catholic high school in the Bronx in 1964, where a steely nun, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), the mother superior, gets information from a young innocent nun, a history teacher in the school, Sister James (Amy Adams), and decides that Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) has an ""improper relation"" with a boy. She moves to force Father Flynn to leave.The film was directed from a screenplay by John Patrick Shanley, who wrote the original play produced on Broadway in 2004 and later in London. Shanley's action is cunningly constructed so as to be coy, yet nonetheless riveting. The events are crucial--and yet they are perhaps, ultimately, not. The issues are bold--yet they are unclear. There is a Jesuitical ingenuity about the arguments and the implications of the plot. They seem spun out of thin air, and you may feel left empty-handed. Nonetheless, amazingly, they also leave you shattered. The main issue indeed is doubt--and suspicion--and how, in the narrow and parochial world of a Catholic school in 1964, people can be manipulated, their lives perhaps destroyed--altered forever anywaydue to pressures and insinuations, with barely a shred of solid evidence to go on.'Doubt' is a bond uniting people as strong as certainty: Father Flynn says this in a sermon he delivers at the outset. The issues are clear though the facts are not. And there are complications. Sister Aloysius adopts a pose of certainty, but in the last scene she sobs and declares she has terrible doubts.The boy, Donald Muller (Joseph Foster), looked troubled after being called down from Sister James's history class to see Father Flynn, and Sister James smelled alcohol on his breath. This is all Sister Aloysius has to go on. The fact is, Aloysius doesn't like Father Flynn, with his taste for pop music and ballpoint pens and his friendly manner with the boys. These things don't tell us if he's guilty or not. But to Sister they're trappings of the Devil.Donald Muller complicates matters in two ways. He is the first Negro boy to attend the high school. When Mrs. Muller (Viola Davis, in a powerful performance) comes to talk to Sister Aloysius, she reveals that her son is ""that way."" She is glad Father Flynn is taking an interest in the boy, because he was ostracized by his classmates at public school for his inclinations, and his father hates him. He needs an adult to support him. It's ""only till June,"" she says. Then he'll graduate and have a chance of college.Father Flynn's explanation is that he'd caught the boy stealing drinks of the altar wine. He implies the boy did it because of the pressure he's under. Sister Aloysius thinks Flynn gave the boy the wine. Donald must be relieved of his altar boy status. We never know what really too place.What happens to Father Flynn is dramatic but not altogether bad. Nonetheless Doubt, for me much more on screen than on stage, is profoundly disturbing and leaves one shaken. It seemed to arouse painful memories of repression and cold authority figures that I experienced in school. Apparently one doesn't have to go to Catholic school to have Catholic school experiences. I confess that I have had contacts with nuns and Catholic priests, and they weren't happy.The film has a vivid physicality the New York production lacked. You can almost smell the linoleum and the incense and hear the swish of the black gowns and the creak of the floors. The Catholic school world is not less vivid for being barren. Mrs. Muller and Sister James have very important roles in the play and the film. But since among other things Doubt is about a power struggle, you can see this as the duel to a draw of two great actors. Streep and Hoffman are virtuosos and they get to strut their stuff. Hoffman gives an unusually generous and complex performance. Hoffman, who tends to play depressed, dysfunctional men who can't cope, here has his warmest, most human role. Streep's role calls for narrowness--and her pinched, pointed features serve her well. It's funny to think that the same meanie in her played even better perhaps in the fashion queen of The Devil Wears Prada. But here she manages a dash of humanity too, behind the coldness. Considering her role's ample opportunities to become caricature, her performance is restrained enough. In their climactic shouting-match battle both get too loud, but this is theater, not ""reality."" Hoffman's Father Flynn is a good man. Remarkably, Streep's Syster Aloysius is not a bad woman.A paradox, not the only one, is that here is a member of the Catholic church trying to root out a pedophile priest, not cover up for one, as was the rule; but Father Flynn may be wrongly accused. It's also a paradox that Father Flynn seems the better person, but he may not be. He represents liberalism. He talks about love, smiling, bringing fun to the school and the community and making the school less like a ""prison."" Sister Aloysius is obviously a meanie, a tyrant--a gorgon. When she calls a boy up to her for discipline Flynn murmurs, ""The dragon is hungry."" But although Flynn looks better and is more appealing, it's still quite possible that Aloysius is right and Flynn is denying the truth when he says there was ""nothing improper.""'Doubt' is a play. It's beautifully, powerfully done. It hasn't exactly been transformed into something truly cinematic. It does its job, as the play did, to shake us into a state of moral confusion, and maybe even awaken painful buried memories. It doesn't necessarily recreate a whole world or even a whole incident. Cinema, like theater, is magic, but also trickery, working with powerful hints.",Doubt
59,billcr12,Clash of titans,8,25 February 2012,"Meryl Streep is Sister Aloysius and Philip Seymour Hoffman is Father Ryan in this riveting drama from John Patrick Shanley, drawing from his experience at a Catholic School in the Bronx of the 1960s. The adaptation from Shanley's play will bring back memories to anyone with similar childhoods. I can recall the nuns at my school walking up and down the aisles, commanding the full attention of the class. Streep nails it so convincingly that she appears to have taken vows before filming the part. The same can be said of Hoffmann who seems to have been ordained after seminary training. Doubt will leave you wondering about faith, religion, and what to believe in. The plot revolves around a 12 year old boy who may or may not have been molested by Father Ryan and the ensuing search for the truth by Sister Aloysius. There is no sentimentality at any point, Shanley keeps it real to the end, we will always in our lives have doubt.",Doubt
60,freemantle_uk,An excellent actor's film with grand themes,9,30 August 2010,"The original play by John Patrick Shanley, Doubt: A Parable won a Pulitzer Prize and won near universal praise. He returned to his material, writing and directing the screen adaptation which obviously designed to gain award nominated but also a powerful showcasing of acting.Doubt is set in a Catholic area of New York in 1964, telling the conflict of a strict conservative nun and principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) and a modern, popular priest Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Sister Aloysius is very old fashioned woman, believing a strict interpretation of the Bible and old fashion values on disciple, whilst Flynn believes the results come from being more friendly with the children and wants the church to be more open and modern. He is an effective teacher. In the middle is Sister James (Amy Adams), a young and naïve history teacher who ends up becoming suspicious about Flynn's relationship with Donald Miller (Joseph Foster), the school's only black student. Aloysius believes the worst and sets out to bring down the priest.There is a lot of ideas and themes in Doubt, showing that Shanley is a skilled writer. There are ideas of the battle between liberals and conservatives in religion, that the Catholic Church was run by men, the aging members of the organisation's leadership, how the church would deal with abuse allegations (it was not a coincidence that this film was set in the 60s) and expertly adds questions on child abuse and what Aloysius' motives for her witch-hunt. Some of the issues have parallels today, that in Catholicism the priesthood and nunneries are aging and that there is no new generation to take. The ideas of liberals and conservatives is a constant battle since the creation of religion: people who want to fight the modern world and people who want to agree we live in the modern world, I personally side with liberals. Doubt shows that church just pass problems priests on and that it was a boys club.Shanley does an excellent job raising doubt about Father Flynn where scenes between Flynn and Donald can easily be interrupted as either the two being too close or simply a caring priest comforting a boy. There are questions like was Donald targeted because he was isolated because of his skin-colour and that his father beat him, making him to gloom or that Flynn knows Donald's problems and that he simply see potential in the boy. There is a lot of ambiguity in the film.But even though Shanley shows he is a good writer and director some moments of his direction is a little heavy handed like when the lights blow out or the use of an almighty gale.Shanley captures the nature of school live and early 60s New York. There is strong dialogue and keeps the characterisation of the young people down to Earth. He keeps the tone realistic and sinister without it having to be grim and depressing.Shanley gets the best out of his actors, placing the camera in the right place and lets them do their thing. Streep and Hoffman are both great actors and act as yin and yang to each other, representing the different ideas of the church. They have serious animosity between the two and both were worthy of actor nods. Amy Adams was also very strong and shows potential as a kind-hearted, naïve young nun cause in the middle. She shows a kind nature of Christianity and tries to embodies both Flynn and Aloysius ideas on the religion. Adams was able to hold her own with the more established actors. She has come a long way from Cruel Intentions 2. Viola Davis in her show her talent in her short amount of screen, showing a mother wanting to her son's education first. I thought it bold move by Shanley not to even give Oprah Winfery a reading when she was lobbying for the role. He stuck to his guns and hired a lesser known actress.Doubt is a actors film with universally excellent performances. Yet Shanley was able to add a lot of deep, characterisation, themes, ideas and commentary about the church and society. An excellent film.",Doubt
61,dfranzen70,Stagey Doubt has strong performances boosting slow tale,7,17 December 2008,"Doubt, a story about a priest accused by a nun of unspeakable (in the film, at least) crimes against a young student, is well crafted with an exceedingly top-notch cast that expertly lifts the movie when there's a pause in the tension. However, it does not completely escape its stage origins, as the film relies perhaps a little too heavily on words, rather than action, to get its muddied points across.Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is the forbidding principal of a Catholic school, of which Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the priest. When the naive Sister James (Amy Adams) reluctantly comes to Sister Aloysius with concerns about Father Flynn's relationship with the only black child in the school (the film's set in 1964), the headmistress decides to get to the bottom of things - no matter the cost.Streep's role as the domineering, terrifying nun seems tailor made for another Oscar run - she's been nominated 15 times - but don't kid yourself; her towering performance will have you shaking in your boots if you ever attended Catholic school, and if you never did, like me, you'll be glad you didn't. She doesn't rap knuckles, because she doesn't need to. She is judge, jury, and executioner in her school - except she reports to the priest. Oops.What makes Streep's character work is that she's mean in the beginning and still mean at the end, so it's not as if she undergoes deep character development in two hours. Still, she's not without compassion, so when word reaches her that the priest - whom she does not particularly like - might have plied an altar boy with wine and then blamed the boy, her hackles, shall we say, get raised. Here, Streep brings the fire and brimstone with a vengeance. Her eyes blaze with fury so often you'll be worried she'll set the school on fire. (Like any good, disciplinary nun.) Streep's not alone with her strong performance. Hoffman is perfectly oily as the smarmy, condescending Father Flynn, a Good Guy who hobnobs with the bishop and is a pal to the kids, particularly the lone black kid. He seems, on the outside, to be a wonderful, beloved priest, and it's his progressive ways - let's have a secular song in our Christmas pageant! - that set Sister Aloysius before the impropriety even occurs. When confronted by the sisters, Father Flynn is ambiguous, then defensive, then explosive, and Hoffman powerfully depicts a man either losing control or in complete, unadulterated control.Completing the troika is the young Sister James, played by the lovely Amy Adams, who looks - dare I blaspheme - absolutely adorable in a nun's habit. Adams is good here, definitely, and she provides the necessary innocence to offset the jaded veneer of Streep and the callous bluster of Hoffman, but sometimes her character just seemed to exist for the purpose of comic relief. Which seemed incongruous, since this movie tackles such serious subjects.Doubt is good to have, Father Flynn tells his flock, because it's a shared emotion; we all doubt. And the ending of John Patrick Shanley's movie (he adapted from his play) is so ambiguous that you're likely to feel what the protagonists are feeling, that what you had thought earlier might not be the truth of the matter at all.",Doubt
62,JoeB131,"Ah, Catholic Memories....",6,16 May 2009,"Can't say I see what all the fuss about this film was for.This film takes place in 1964 Catholic school, as an old nun Sister Aloyusius, takes on a modern priest, Father Flynn, whom she suspects of molesting the schools first black student. The film is about the conflict between these two characters.It's hard to like either one of them. Sister Al is the typical old school nun (one almost thinks of Sister Mary Stigmata in the Blues Brothers) who terrifies children and has a bug up her habit. Father Flynn is molesting a kid. Or maybe he isn't. Even the kid's mother doesn't seem to care, because she's concluded the kid is going to grow up to be an interior decorator anyway.In some ways, this is a period piece. YOu have the Church after Vatican II trying to modernize, and a lot of the old school not taking well to change. (Sister A is a traditionalist while Flynn is a modernist.) You have the hierarchy of the Church where the nuns don't have the power and influence of the priests. Some people have called this film ""anti-Catholic"". You know what, I went to Catholic Schools for 12 years, my mom taught at one. This really is what they were like back in the day. The older nuns really were mean old birds. There were a lot of priests you knew you never wanted to be alone in a room with because they were that way.The film's ending is ambiguous, because they just sent the priest to a new parish. Well, doesn't that just make him someone else's problem? I think the final line of ""Sister, I have such doubts"" is one of someone who has dedicated her life to something she now suspects is corrupt, not that she had any doubt about Flynn's guilt.",Doubt

""Leave it to Sister Beaver"" to make such accusations.

64,st-shot,American Film's heavyweight acting champs square off.,8,29 December 2008,"There are no better actors working in American film today than Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Streep has been on top for some time now and Hoffman has an unmatched resume of fine performances over the past five years. Pairing off as adversaries in John Patrick Shanley's stage play brought to screen they parry and prod throughout with each landing hay makers along the way.Change is in the wind in 1964 for both the world and the Catholic Church (Second Vatican Council) as the country moves from conservatism to liberal thought. Sister Aloysius (Streep)is the principal of an inner city Catholic school who rules with an iron fist. Lamenting the loss of tradition (she thinks Frosty the Snowman is a song about worshiping false idols) she crosses swords with the popular and laid back Father Flynn who takes a more liberal view seeing the need to keep up with the times. His progressive ways gnaw at Sister Aloysius and she is soon suspecting Father Flynn of inappropriate relationship with altar boys even though she is without concrete proof.The scenes between Streep and Hoffman are riveting from start to finish. Both attempt at first to be civil with each other but eventually they end up at each others throat bullying and threatening. It is a titanic emotional struggle that makes for a gripping drama flawlessly acted. I'm no big fan of Streep, finding the adopted accents she employs in some of her films false and hollow, but as the self righteous Nunzilla her pugnacious style and inflection rates with her Sophie's Choice performance. Hoffman has his work cut out for him to keep up with the formidable legend but he holds his own with equal footing.In supporting roles Amy Adams is very effective as the unintended go between Sister James. Seized with doubt she like the audience mirrors our own misgivings as conflicted objective observers. Viola Davis as a troubled boy's mother has one lengthy powerful and painful scene that begins to tie loose ends together but offers no easy solution.Writer director John Patrick Shanley does an admirable job in keeping the plot nebulous with ambivalent scenes and peripheral characters that purposefully enhance the suspense. Scenes are tightly edited with sparse but effective dialog giving the film its steady pace. Other than some jarring oblique angle shots the camera compositions and set design provide a somber ambiance for the drama and an arena for the perfectly measured performances by two masters of the craft in this fight to the finish that remains absorbing from beginning to end.",Doubt
65,MaxBorg89,"A real ""actors' film""",8,17 February 2009,"At first sight, Doubt could be dismissed as the usual preachy morality tale about done-to- death subjects like the problems between Church and the rest of society and the bad reputation of Catholic priests. However, playwright John Patrick Shanley, whose first (and, prior to this film, last) directorial outing for the big screen was the not-so-loved Joe vs. the Volcano (1990), is too smart to tackle such topics lightly, and brings his acclaimed play to the screen with the intention of giving no easy answers and avoiding everything that comes close to predictable storytelling.The setting is New York, and the year is 1964. People are still affected by the death of JFK and are uncertain about the future. This is something Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a priest who teaches at a Catholic school, is very aware of, and by combining those concerns with his natural charisma he delivers sermons that reach all the way to the heart and soul of those who listen. Only one person is completely indifferent to Flynn's attitude: Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep), the school's strict principal, who sees nuns and priests as people who can't coexist with the rest of the world. One day, the young and naive Sister James (Amy Adams) tells Sister Aloysius of her suspicions regarding Father Flynn's interactions with Donald Miller (Joseph Foster), the school's first African-American student, and with no proof whatsoever aside from her absolute certainty, the principal accuses Flynn of improper conduct, thus initiating a conflict that will have negative repercussions for everyone involved.Shanley doesn't do much to hide the film's theatrical origin: the story is told almost exclusively through dialogues or monologues (Father Flynn's witty sermons), all three of the key players get an equal share of time in the limelight and there's a definite ""artsy"" quality to certain scenes, such as when all the nuns get up simultaneously in the morning and prepare for the day's duties. Perhaps it was inevitable, since Shanley follows his original text to the letter (including the wonderfully open ending), but it constitutes a partial downside since those ""artsy"" moments feel too staged and forced to really fit in with the rest of the narrative. The wisest decision, in this case, would have been to leave the movie in the hands of a more experienced director, like David Mamet did with Glengarry Glen Ross (another character- driven drama, but devoid of any pretentious ""artistic"" shots).On the other hand, by effectively trusting the actors to carry the bulk of the story without any external help, Shanley offers a string of performances that are nothing short of astonishing: Streep's character, in particular, could have been lazily described as the nun version of Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada, but she hasn't earned the reputation of being the best American actress of her generation without a good reason - Sister Aloysius is much more ego-driven than Miranda, and the dry wit is of a completely different brand. Next to her, most performers have a tendency to be overshadowed, both on screen and off, but Hoffman and Adams (plus Viola Davis in what is essentially a one-scene role) prove to be really worthy adversaries. Besides, it's a pleasure to watch Hoffman play the ""good"" guy for a change, given his trademark propensity for weirdos or villainous parts.All in all, Doubt is, first and foremost, an actors' piece, and the cast is probably the main reason people are inclined to watch i t (I was going to say there's no doubt, but it sounds kind of cheap under the circumstances). That doesn't detract from the story's power, though: some might be annoyed by the absence of proper answers (but hey, honestly, how often do we get them these days?), but Shanley handles an uncomfortable theme with restraint and precision, delivering a morally ambiguous, consistently riveting character study.",Doubt

The thing that not really saved this movie, but helped it a lot, was the a list acting. The movie just got kind of boring, and a chore to stay interested. Don't get me wrong, the actors deserved their Oscar nominations, they really did. It's just that the film is hard to stay interested in. It fails at being intriguing and interesting. In short, great acting by A list actors, no substance or interest. 5/10.",Doubt
68,3xHCCH,We Decide This One On Our Own,9,5 February 2009,"""Doubt"" is about a strict traditionalist nun Sr. Aloysius who is a terror principal of a Catholic School. She frowns upon modernities like ballpoint pens and secular Christmas carols. She suspects improprieties regarding their progressive younger parish priest Fr. Flynn. When one of her teachers Sr. James tells her about a suspicious incident involving Fr. Flynn and the school's first African-American student Donald Miller, Sr. Aloysius uses this to launch her virulent attack against the priest.""Doubt"" is truly an acting vehicle. When it played on Broadway in 2005, the actors who played Sr. Aloysius, Fr. Flynn, Sr. James and Mrs. Miller all got nominated for Tony Awards. When playwright John Patrick Shanley reincarnates his script for film, he decides to direct it himself. Now, as then, all four actors who played these rich characters are again nominated for Oscars.Playing the imperious Sr. Aloysius is none other than Meryl Streep. Her attack on the role is a bit theatrical, but it is really masterful, like no other actress can do it. Each of her one-on-one scenes with Amy Adams (Sr. James), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Fr. Flynn) and Viola Davis (Mrs. Miller) is an acting highlight which also brings out the best in the other actor. All of these actors fully deserve their nominations given their very realistic portrayal of these difficult and complex roles.When you watch this film, you fully appreciate its theater origins. It is driven by very strong and incisive dialogue alone. Despite the fact that this film is all talk, with no real action, I liked it very much. I like that it is thought provoking. I like that the ending did not really tell the audience what really happened. Fr. Flynn did not categorically say if he is guilty or not. Sister Aloysius did not really say what she was doubting at the end. It is all for us to decide for ourselves.",Doubt
69,JoeKarlosi,Doubt (2008) ****,10,1 February 2009,"Riveting performances from Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman highlight this intense story of a 1964 Bronx, New York Catholic school's head nun and its chief priest, who are at odds with each other. As Sister Aloysius Beauvier, Streep is a staunch and conservatively no-nonsense disciplinarian who looks down with disdain on the free-spirited progressive ways of Father Brendan Flynn (Hoffman). Joining the father in his modern way of thinking is the youngest nun in the church, an 8th grade teacher called Sister James (Amy Adams). But there is cause for concern when Sister James uncovers evidence that the well-liked Father Flynn may be engaging in improper conduct with the only black student in the school, a 12-year-old boy named Donald. Sister Aloysius seizes this opportunity to try and have Flynn ousted from the school at any cost, despite that there is no clear-cut unshakable evidence to indicate the priest's guilt, and that Father Flynn's side of the story sounds perfectly legitimate.What makes this movie so good is not only the aforementioned standout performances from Streep and Hoffman, but also Amy Adams as the distraught sister in the middle, and a strong turn by Viola Davis in a key scene as the young boy's desperate mother. In a few differently powerful confrontational sequences, Streep and Hoffman are just amazing to observe together. In some ways Hoffman's acting is exceptional, as we are never one hundred percent certain as to whether he's innocent of the charge or not. We're also not sure what to make out of Streep's motivations for wanting to bring him down. This all adds up to a powerful ending scene which drives home the film's message for us, and makes us leave the film questioning what we think may actually have happened, and why. **** out of ****",Doubt

71,slokes,What Happened In The Rectory,9,26 September 2012,"Someday, maybe, John Patrick Shanley will come clean and tell us all what really happened in the rectory between Father Flynn and that Miller kid. Until then, we are left with the myriad conflicting versions of us, the audience.Is it for the better? I have doubts. But not knowing does make for a rich and singular film-going experience, delivered here by Shanley as director and a killer cast led by Philip Seymour Hoffman as the suspect priest and Meryl Streep as the senior nun who reaches a conclusion she has no choice but follow to its grisly end.Shanley does a great job right away putting us in a position to judge no one fairly. On the one side, you have the sordid history of sex scandals in the Catholic Church which would make one predisposed to believe the worst in Flynn. Point against. Yet Flynn speaks in favor of what he calls ""progressive education and a welcoming church,"" and seems a refreshing breeze for a grim Bronx parish circa 1964. Point in favor.Sister Aloysius's suspicions seem to dovetail too neatly into a general fear of change brought about by the liberalizations of the then-new Vatican II Council. Point in favor. But Streep plays her as a self- demanding character with a more worldly outlook than she lets on, willing to risk all in the service of those children who cringe at the sight of her, able to get Father Flynn to talk a little too long about whether he ever did something wrong. Point against.It all adds up to a pretty amazing experience, and its impact can be witnessed in the robust back-and-forth found on the message boards here. The first couple of times I saw it, I was convinced of Flynn's guilt, but then I read some alternate explanations for his behavior offered by other viewers, and now see where they are coming from. I'm glad I'm not the principal.The verisimilitude of the film does a lot to make you care. Streep is pretty brilliant, surprisingly gentle and funny but realistically frightening at least to this veteran Catholic schoolboy. You get to see her showing compassion for an aging nun as well as her fangs to a schoolboy who makes the mistake of touching a nun. (""The dragon is hungry,"" jokes Father Flynn.) It's a tight little film, but Shanley gives Streep a lot of room to develop her character, and it serves to put us on her side however hidebound she is to the laws of her church.Hoffman's Father Flynn is by contrast only given little moments to clue us in. He delivers mesmerizing sermons and enjoys the awe he inspires in his young charges with a satisfaction that can seem smug if you are predisposed to see it that way. One scene shows him looking at a stained-glass window with a heavenly eye floating at its center, bearing down on him. What does he feel when he looks up at it, guilt or doubt? Maybe trust? He's the riddle of the story, and Hoffman does a great job keeping us guessing the more he speaks.Poor Amy Adams is the third wheel in this production, more of a reactor as innocent Sister James. While Streep and Hoffman get to rail to the heavens, her big moment comes when she delivers the line ""Well, I LIKE 'Frosty The Snowman'!"" Adams is solid, though, because she does her job of keeping our attention on the two leads. When she goes away near the end of the film, we miss seeing the story through the one character we feel we can trust.There are bits of obvious symbolism that call attention to themselves, like a bird trapped inside a church and a light bulb in Sister Aloysius's office whenever there's a moment of high drama. Shanley likes his Dutch angles, everything presented askew. It does get a bit tinny.But the overall arc of the story and the caliber of the lead performances make ""Doubt"" the kind of film that doesn't tire at all with repeat viewings. In fact, you feel yourself finding new things to call into question previous certainties. The movie ends on a still frame of the movie title, and that feels about as apt a way to sum it all up.",Doubt
72,EUyeshima,The Quality of Mercy Is Not Strained in This Compelling Actors' Showcase,8,12 March 2009,"Director/writer John Patrick Shanley measures the quality of mercy in his uncommonly well-crafted 2008 adaptation of his 2004 Broadway hit. One can imagine how well his intimate story must have played onstage as a four-actor chamber piece since the vivid personal interactions raise large questions about morality and organized religion. The title refers to the religious doubt that results when faith is not enough to reconcile suspicion with intellectual certainty. The subject of doubt is a popular priest who could be violating his position of trust and power. The question then becomes whether the severity of an accusation is enough to convict someone of wrongdoing and how the accuser must live with the consequences of raising doubt among others without the burden of proof.The story takes place in 1964, a year after Kennedy's assassination, in a non-segregated Bronx Catholic school. It's a time of great tumult in the church with the Second Vatican sweeping in reforms that prove unsettling to old-school Catholics like Sister Aloysius, the strict school principal who terrorizes the students with her mean-spirited, iron hand tactics. She is offended by ballpoint pens, too much sugar in others' tea, and the possible use of ""Frosty the Snowman"" in the holiday pageant. Her adversary is also her immediate superior, Father Flynn, a compassionate young priest who is fully immersed in the daily life of his congregation, particularly with the schoolboys whom he coaches in basketball and in life's lessons. She is suspicious of his motives, and when Sister James, an innocent novice, reports that one of her students, Donald Miller, returned from a meeting with the priest behaving strangely, Sister Aloysius becomes determined to remove him from his post.What Shanley does particularly well with this set-up is ensure we never know the true story and whether Sister Aloysius' assumptions are based in hard evidence. The ensemble cast is superior. It becomes redundant to praise Meryl Streep, but she does bring an ardent fervor and unapologetic small-mindedness to the formidable Sister Aloysius with a convincing accent that comes by way of the Grand Concourse. She infuses her vinegary character with welcome humor. As Flynn, Philip Seymour Hoffman manages to bring enough ambiguity to the priest to make the suspicions palpable, while Amy Adams plays Sister James with her natural perkiness toned down to reflect her character's questioning conscience. As Donald's anguished mother, Viola Davis blazes with quiet authority in an impressive face-off with Sister Aloysius that ends with an unsettling revelation. Shanley brings out all the dramaturgy of his work with full gale force and does not shy away from the dark, somber theme. It's just a good thing the actors make it intensely involving as well.",Doubt

He wisely opened it up, for us to see more of the Church & surrounding area. Only one very short scene is set away from the church area.The time period is December 1964,I felt transported back to that time, & was mesmerized by the superb acting of the 4 principals & the 12 year old lad who is the crux of the story.A young Nun misinterprets what she sees,innocently reports it to her superior.This superior sees evil everywhere.this creates problem for all concerned including the mother of the lad om question.I will tell no more.Meryl Streep is the principal of the school,She can see evil everywhere & in every one. She is the teacher we all hated when we went to school.If after seeing Miss Streep in this film & the one before this MAMMA MIA,you will never again doubt that she is one of very best actresses ever to grace the silver screen.Philip Seymour Hoffman has created many memorable characters. His role here as the Priest who may or may not have done something improper, is equally mesmerizing. Over the years there have been many excellent Priest roles by actors, now add Philip Seymour Hoffman to the list headed by Spencer Tracy & Pat O'Brien, who to me were the very best playing priestly roles.Amy Adams relatively new to the screen is the young nun that starts the rumour of possible wrong doing. she is magnificent, she is the teacher you always loved.Viola Davis is the mother of the lad, She has only 2 scenes & in one of them she steals your heart away.All 4 actors have won or been nominated for awards for there acting in this great play & film.The 12 year old lad who is the crux of the story is very well acted by Joseph Foster, this is only his second performance, He has definite possibilities.In both the play or film, we do not know if the priest is innocent or guilty.

It's not surprise that the movie is based on a Pullitzer winning play, and most importantly, though not necessarily the best choice, it was also directed by the original writer.""Doubt"" has much intensity, but its uneven, there are moments that you almost suffocate because of its powerful subject matter, as lines are exchanged by the likes of some of our best actors. Somehow, something strange happens during some of these scenes, as we focus our attention on those histrionics and stop listening. Meryl is almost a force of nature, but she is a times, just a little too cold, almost robotic in her perfection. Hoffman fares a little better, but he has to keep up with her, and we feel almost as if we are watching a showcase for acting, not exploring the depths and darkness of a debatable subject.There are moments when true emotions burst through, and these are mostly the responsibility of the marvelous supporting cast, as Adams and Davis show their vulnerability and sympathy to Streep's superior and implacable director. Particularly, Streep's street scene with the child's mother will trigger hundreds of conversations as the mother pleads the case to one of the most obsessed and driven characters seen in recent movies.""Doubt"" is not a perfect film, but it is very good at exposing the rationale behind many of the emotional and flawed actions of humans.

75,Enchorde,Stellar acting,6,17 June 2012,"Doubt is a very well played movie, an escalating conflict between the characters of Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Streep plays the nun Beauvier that suspects Father Flynn, the parish priest, to have an improper relationship with a young boy in the church's school. In a series of confrontations the pressure and tension between them rises until one of them must break. Is Beauvier's suspicions correct? There are clues that support her feeling. Or are Flynn's explanations, that are plausible, how it is? In the middle, between them, is Sister James. She has doubts. Whom is correct? It is a decent plot that is augmented by great acting. It is a thrill to see Streep and Hoffman to go up against another. The plot, however, is thinner, even with the mounting suspense. Part of it is that the audience is also held in doubt. Since the title and theme is what it is I can understand why that is done, and in part it does help to build the tension. But I'm not sure it is the right one in the end. The movie ends without really revealing the truth, or give any real ending at all, and some part of me wants a conclusion. I know it is simplistic and that the truth is in reality impossible to know, and perhaps during the circumstances not important. But the movie-watcher in me that wants to be entertained feels a little cheated.The character Sister James is used a little oddly. In the beginning she is in the middle of it. She is the one that makes the observations that leads to the suspicions. It is in her classroom that many clues are found. She is the character that tries to find the moral balance in the story, that tries to find the truth, proofs, and not be lead by her own preconceptions. Early on she seems to be the character that pushes the story forward, but later on she suddenly disappears, she needs to go to a sick brother, and only appears briefly at the end. I wonder if the story would have unveiled more naturally in Sister James' perspective, not clouded by any convictions. Her uncertainty would have given the suspense some edge.The acting is well worth the Academy Awards it got nominated for, and the story is set in an interesting context, considering the news from recent years. However, as a movie it lacked an edge to me. It might be the concealed truth, it might be Sister James' disappearance, it might be something else.6/10",Doubt
76,onepotato2,The power of Christ compels you ...to give me an Oscar,4,23 December 2009,"Doubt has a problem. It wants its ambiguity in the foreground and that prevents it from being a better movie on either of two fronts. It cheats the audience of either the moral finger-wagging of the child molestation storyline, and it minimizes the dramatic stakes the non-molestation angle offers. The movie could even have gone a third (more interesting) place; Namely, that a caring gay priest can still aid in the shaping of young men, and may be more interested in the task than men who are out conquering the world for their own self-aggrandizement. The unspoken subtext of the piece is that adult men, who are not molesters, can no longer show kindness or affection to young men (and thus, become their stewards) either, without being suspect. Looking back on my education there were any number of male teachers (who were obviously gay in hindsight) who really cared about us as kids. We didn't have a clue.Streep is a cruel shrew/nun who seeks out and pounces on arbitrary transgressions that you or I would not perceive because they don't exist. Streep plays the kind of miserable emotional vampire that thinks her job is to make children ready for the harsh world, a world she makes harsher by the minute. She runs her school like Joe McCarthy. Her current pogrom is to find the pretext to dump a priest she finds effeminate ...or perhaps she finds him effeminate SO that she can fire him. She envies any hint that she doesn't have all the control and the attention. She is continually on guard against joy, or free thought. She's the 'ends justifies the means' type, who tramples everything in her path. Phillip Seymour Hoffman (the accused) bellows at her, ""What will make you stop?"" ""CONFESS!"" Streep shouts. And viewers scratch their heads asking, 'Didn't we see this in The Crucible?' The biggest problem here is that Streep is never given any shred of motivation. She's just a shallow, biddie baddie dressed like Boris Badanov. So when her 11th hour guilt kicks in, a viewer is just bewildered by the whole endeavor. When the dam breaks, it's so uncharacteristic of the nun (um, vulnerable? ...no), that we know we're just looking at Streep shamelessly bidding for an Oscar. Movies whose central point is ambiguity, have long ago ceased offering anything but shallow returns (Yay, a guessing game). The milieu is so strong here that I wanted to see it poured over, instead of glossed over in favor of one dreary point. But ""Ambiguity"" (which allows 3 or 4 actors opportunities to be dramatic) is on the big list of approved Oscar gambits.",Doubt

Some people here believes the priest wasn't having an affair with the kid, but just trying to protect his sexual orientation.

78,lewiskendell,One of my favorite movies.,9,1 February 2016,"Doubt is a compelling, emotionally dense drama. Not a typical, watered-down contemporary film drama, but the kind of drama that usually only comes from a compelling work of literature. It continues the tradition of No Country for Old Men and There Will be Blood in the way that it suspends your own sensibilities and thrusts you wholly into the world of the characters.The film wouldn't be so captivating without it's marvelous cast, but they wouldn't be able to shine so brightly without this outstanding script. The exchanges between characters are eloquent, yet believable. There's almost a music to the dialogue, and the theme of the tune switches from kindness to confrontation to lingering disquiet with every scene. It's no surprise that mixing acting titans with an extraordinary screenplay resulted in Oscar nominations for all the principal actors, as well as one for the script.Doubt is essentially about the crisis of seeing the world in black and white, good and evil, when there's no way of knowing with certainty that you are right. Even if your actions or intentions are good, the consequences that they bring about will not come with a price. The subject matter is distasteful, but it's never handled in an exploitative or crude manner.

The time period is 1964.This was a play made into a movie and yes, these plays-into-movies are talky, talky, talky, but this one works because of the star power and good dialogueand, it wasn't too talky because the dialogue was quick, lively and was spread around evenly. Oh, it also works because there is doubt about Sister Aloysius' claims, and doubt whether or not Father Flynn is guilty of anything. I sided with Fr Flynn and looked at Sister Aloysius as a real bitch (don't hold back, Bob, tell us how you really feel).The acting all around is Oscar Worthy, but I would put my money on Viola Davis, the boy's mother. If you don't tear up and feel her lack of hope when you watch the conversation between Mrs. Miller (Davis) and Sister Aloysius you aren't paying attention. I hope she gets nominated and wins. Amy Adams as Sister James is actually the one who keeps the movie from turning into an all-out brawl between the priest and the Sister, but there is a moment when it could have become just that. Great stuff. This has nothing to do with anything, but I have my doubts if it was a good idea to have a hottie like Amy Adams portray a Sister?

80,bandw,Living with Doubt,9,23 September 2009,"The year is 1964 and the place is the Saint Nicholas Church School in the Bronx. The story details an internecine struggle between the school principal, Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) and the parish priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymore Hoffman). Sister Aloysius is old school (she even opposes the use of ballpoint pens) and Father Flynn embraces more openness and engagement with the modern world. Inevitably Flynn and Aloysius must come into conflict, but the good Sister takes it as her mission to bring Flynn down. She is on the lookout for any possible indiscretions on the priest's part and alerts a newly-arrived naive nun, Sister James (Amy Adams) to keep an eye out. Sister James does report a couple of incidents that indicate that Father Flynn is showing special attention to a young black boy who is having a hard time of it, not the least because he is the only black in the school. Sister Aloysius leaps on the meager evidence as proof that Father Flynn is having improper relations with the boy, and the battle is on.My first impression was that Streep's performance was a bit over the top, but some Catholic friends who grew up in the 60s told me that such nuns were not at all atypical in their experience. Hoffman gives a strong performance; his two sermons on doubt and gossip are powerful. A person who could consistently give such sermons, with the emotional force of a Hoffman, would prompt me to be in the pew listening.One theme emphasized is the privileged position of priests with respect to the nuns. Father Flynn simply assumes his position of power. So there is more than one reason why Sister Aloysius may resent Father Flynn and, being lower in the food chain, she has to devise an indirect strategy to attack him and she seizes on the accusation of child abuse. More than one innocent person has been ruined simply by such an accusation.But, is Father Flynn innocent? This film cleverly tempts us to violate one of its main messages, that being the need to accept the fact of living with doubt. The first thing people discuss after seeing this movie is whether Father Flynn is guilty of Sister Aloysius' charge. Since the evidence in not conclusive, you are encouraged to make up your own answer to that question, and that is not living with doubt.I was puzzled by the final scene where Sister Aloysius confesses her doubts. What was she doubting? I guess, in keeping with the main theme, we are to be left in doubt about that.",Doubt
81,tomsview,Wind of doubt,8,25 July 2016,"Although ""Doubt"" demonstrates Philip Seymour Hoffman's ability to get inside a role and inhabit a character, there is a scene towards the end that has added poignancy since his untimely death. When his character, Father Brendan Flynn, delivers a farewell to his congregation, it could almost stand as the actor's farewell to the world:""I never like to say goodbye. But there is a wind behind every one of us that takes us through our lives. We never see it, we can't command it; we don't even know its purpose. I would have stayed with you longer, but that wind is taking me away"" The words are by author and director John Patrick Shanley, and this film, based on his play, is an inspired work by all involved.An outgoing and likable priest, Father Brendan Flynn, is observed by Sister James (Amy Adams), a teacher at the parish school, engaging in what she thinks is inappropriate behaviour towards one of her pupils. She reports it to the principle of the Parish School, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep). Sister Aloysius has a wary view of human nature and is a believer in firm discipline. She could have given a few tips on keeping order to Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman in ""Full Metal Jacket"".Sister James' suspicions set off a train of events that have a surprising result, but also brings to a head the clash between Sister Aloyisius' traditional values, and Father Flynn's more progressive approach to the pupils and his congregation.Although Meryl Streep's Sister Aloysius seems austere and unapproachable in the beginning, the genius of her performance is in the way we end up seeing her as safeguarding the most vulnerable people in the story, the children.This film is a celebration of the power of words, and single words resonate throughout the story: doubt, intolerance, gossip, trust and compassion.""Doubt"" has the suspense of a thriller, but eventually leaves us wondering.John Patrick Shanley is as assured a director as he is a writer.

82,DeeNine-2,Starts slow but builds to a powerful conclusion,10,31 July 2009,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)The doubt is on two levels. One, there is the doubt that Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) molested the boy. The deeper doubt is that if he did, did he do anything wrong? Or on an even deeper level, did the wrong that he did outweigh the good that he did? This last question is at the very heart of the relationship between priests and boys in the near contemporary American society depicted in this film.Personally I don't believe that the ephemeral culture in which we live can answer that question. Perhaps it is true that people like Father Flynn are compelled to do good in this world for just those boys who most need them because of their ""nature"" (as Meryl Streep's character Sister Aloysius puts it). Science has a lot of trouble accounting for homosexuality, and understandably most scientists aren't interested in exploring why some men are sexually attracted to boys. The truth from an evolutionary point of view must be that in some sense that attraction leads to, paradoxically, a better fit for not only the boy, which is obvious in some circumstances, but also for the man. How can this be? Most theories about homosexuality invoke male bonding as the evolutionary force that makes the behavior adaptive. Homosexual males bond with other males (homosexual or not) and thereby increase their access to females. So great is the advantage that accrues to such males that even the homosexual males (who mate only to have offspring) have an adaptive advantage over outsider males.But what is the adaptive advantage to males who are sexually attracted only to boys? In a way this film (and the direction by John Patrick Shanley based on his play) actually addresses this question. The answer comes from the scene in which Sister Aloysius and the boy's mother (Viola Davis as Mrs. Miller) talk and walk. The mother clearly sees that whether her boy is getting molested by the priest or not is secondary to the fact that the priest cares about him more than his father. In other words (and most specifically in other circumstances) the priest would become the ally of the mother and they would bond. In a world far removed from ours, in the prehistory, they might become as one. Or in a world removed from the celibacy of the priesthood he would love the boy and the mother and she would love him and sex would happen, although perhaps not as frequently as it would if the man were heterosexual. Certainly he is a better man for the boy and for any further boys than a father who would beat his son.Meryl Streep who has given us so many brilliant performances gives yet another one here. And Hoffman ditto. I have said it before and I'll repeat it, Meryl Streep is nearly flawless in everything she does. Philip Seymour Hoffman ditto. To see two of the greatest actors of our time in the same film is quite a treat. To give them such indelible characters to work with and such a compelling story to act out is really wonderful. And I must say that Amy Adams who played Sister James was also excellent and was not noticeably overshadowed by Streep and Hoffman. Viola Davis who played the one scene as the boy's mother was also excellent.The movie starts slowly as in a play, which it is. This is allowable since the play-going audience has an investment and won't get up even if the first act goes slowly. After a few minutes the story picks up and gathers power until, with a not entirely discernible suddenness, we are enthralled. In the end we realize how quickly the story was actually told.Do not give up on this after the first ten or fifteen minutes. It is a story about an issue for our times not to be missed, told with dignity and compassion for all concerned, and with a deep appreciation for the subtleties and paradoxes of human nature and the complexities of our world.",Doubt
83,wisewebwoman,Pitiful Movie Conversion of a Powerful Play,4,26 February 2009,"Full disclosure: I had some minor reservations about the play, depicting a catholic school of 1964, dominated by the a power struggle between a nun and a priest. It stretched my credibility metre that a nun of that era would defy a priest. I was educated in a catholic convent in that era and that would never have happened. Nuns were cowed by the holy fathers. Those saintly men who diddled and drank were never challenged.That said, the play was small and tight, well scripted with believable characterizations.Exploded in Hollywood style to the big screen it does not work. The fact that Shanley, the playwright, is also responsible for the movie was a shocker to me. How could he trash his own play? Meryl Streep, and I'm an admirer, phones in her performance as the principal, her accent varies, her one-note unbending righteousness gets tiresome after ten minutes and there are no subtleties. Her acolyte, played by Amy Adams, rings untrue as well, the boss would have chewed her up and spat her out as a matter of course in her first week teaching.Philip Seymour Hoffman, and I'm also an admirer of his, was seriously miscast or perhaps it was that the layers of character and motivation in the play were absent here.The much touted doubt should have stayed with the audience.The last scene was appalling, right up there with the fifty worst endings of a film.And did I mention all the anachronisms? Too many to list.4 out of 10. Much less would have worked so much better. Or better yet, some plays should stay that way.",Doubt
84,Screen_Blitz,"Though nothing provocative, this film provides a powerful examination on it's touchy subject matter",7,30 September 2016,"There's a thought-provoking message to be handed from this film, and the message is doubt is a more powerful weapon than certainty in the moral code; a message that director John Patrick Shanely incorporates well in this religiously-charged drama based on his award-winning play. Though the play itself is not necessarily based on historical events, it certainly does mirror some real-life circumstances that have occurred in the Catholic Church for many, many decades, but only to have remained stray from the public eye for many years before finally being uncovered by the news media in the early 2000s. With cases of child molestrations occurring by Catholic priests throughout the last century, it is not to easy to deny that this film pervades with subject matter that will surely hit close to home for some, especially as these sorts of events have hit hard to challenge the faith of many born-again Christians; and this film paints a smart, if somewhat flawed picture of a moment that sets off the ignition of doubt. Set in 1964 in Bronx, New York, this film follows a story of Sister Aloysius Beavier (played by Meryl Streep), an iron-fisted principal of the Saint Nicholas Catholic School who has a wide eye for finding moral sin around every corner and believes in her fearful disciplinary style of wash the school free of sinful behavior. Father Flynn (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is an assistant of the school and while serving as the priest of the local Catholic Church. When the school enrolls their first African- American student Donald Miller (played by Joseph Foster), Father Flynn takes special interest in the boy which leads to newcomer Sister James (played by Amy Adams) sharing suspicion with Sister Aloysius that Flynn has engaged in an improper relationship. In desperation to uncover the truth, Sister Aloysius engages in a battle of wills against Flynn that threatens the very foundation of the Catholic school.Translating a stage play into an on screen outlet is always a daunting task, and without the direction can lead to major, if not massive cinematic disappointment. Fortunately, John Patrick Shanely hands in the ingredients to deliver a film that though struggles in the narrative department, manages to be smart and mature in a compelling way. After spending some quality time introducing the characters and getting them settled in, the film presents us with a short scene between Father Flynn and the young boy Donald Miller which soon sets off the plot in a desperate pursuit to crack the truth whether this Catholic priest is just a man trying to protect the boy from possible racial prejudice (keep in mind that this takes place during the Civil Rights era) or simply trying to help the lad fit in, or the horrifying pedophile Aloysius suspects he is. As Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character develops, he grows likable to the point you hope that Sister Aloysius's suspicion is just false alarm. But as the story dives deeper into a Father Flynn's past, you begin to develop the feeling that maybe this man is not so innocent as he appears. From there on, the story keeps you guessing on why this man is taking so crucial interest in this new kid and whether or not he has committed the ""ultimate sin"". While the story more than not tends to feel shallow in it's emotional core and sometimes even a little sluggish, the biggest payoffs is the performances by Meryl Streep as Sister Aloysius. For an actress with a higher number of Oscar nominations under her belt, Streep plays her role with great posture and maturity, and the cinematic talent she's brought over the years definitely shines through. Amy Adams, playing the slightly optimistic teacher, also remains decent as ever for the fine actress she is. Sharing only a short amount of screen time is Viola Davis as the boy's mother who leads one good emotional moment where Donald's past is firmly revealed. Finally, there is Phillip Seymour Hoffman who delivers a strong sense of liveliness and maturity in his role, and his scenes with Meryl Streep are likely to leave you debating of who stands out above the other. They're both equally that good.Doubt is nothing necessarily provocative or surprising, but it shows John Patrick Shanely at his directorial efforts on bringing this stage play adaptation to life, and feature some amazing performances by a powerfully ingenious cast. Though the film ends on a rather dry note that is likely to trigger the feeling of ""what, that's it?"" in some viewers, the majority of this film remains a genuine artwork, but not without it's flaws.",Doubt
85,dunmore_ego,Sinfully Good.,8,28 April 2009,"DOUBT lives up to its title so staunchly that we cannot do anything but.About a Catholic priest, Father Flynn (the magnificent Philip Seymour Hoffman), accused by a nun, Sister Aloysius (the also-magnificent Meryl Streep) of inappropriate relations with a grade-school boy.No evidence, no proof, no witnesses, no reports. Yet Aloysius has no doubt.Caught in the crossfire of accusation and indecision is Sister James (Amy Adams), whose sympathies flip-flop between Aloysius and Flynn.Written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, from his Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name, DOUBT is a writhing serpent of accusation and denial, strident hypocrisy, sexual frustration and lurid innuendo. Yes, it's about Catholics.Father Flynn is one of those cool priests who gags with the schoolboys and gives sermons that don't put people to sleep. In trying to make the learning environment at St. Nicholas school more personable, Flynn arouses the suspicious eye of battleaxe Aloysius, dragonlady school principal, who claims his friendliness is pedophilia.But this word is never mentioned. Set in 1964, social mores force everyone to tiptoe around the most damaging and dangerous crimes. Neither does anyone say the words molestation, rape, homosexual, or even sex.DOUBT is so good because it never blatantly shows us the ""crime"" that Flynn is accused of. It gives us intimations of a closeness between Flynn and young African-American altar boy, Donald (Joseph Foster) and then - the accusation hits everyone square in the bleeding heart.We doubt the accusation at first, then we doubt Flynn's denial.Then, in a morbid twist, Donald's mother (Viola Davis) reveals to Sister Aloysius that Donald may have caused the alleged incident unintentionally, because he may be ""that way."" And we find ourselves doubting the poor boy's sexuality.But every scene is truncated by interruptions - a phone call, a knock on the door, or someone just busting in like Kramer - and none of the arguments are resolved.Just when you think Shanley has left us hanging - he has! We end up doubting exactly what transpired between poor Donald and Father Flynn, who is forced to resign his post by the acerbic Aloysius. A pivotal scene between Hoffman and Streep is like Godzilla and Megalon thundering through skyscrapers, Hoffman's Flynn outraged yet waxing ambiguous throughout, ""There are things that cannot be said,"" while Streep's Aloysius frustratingly steamrolls him. Flynn asks Aloysius if she has ever committed a mortal sin - to which she admits 'yes' - and of his last great sin being between him and his confessor. What do we make of this? Well, doubt, for one thing! We may think DOUBT is structured to make Flynn look falsely accused - but this doesn't account for the way WOMEN would view the exact same film. Through high maintenance shrike eyes. Women who would side with the nun simply for the sameness of sex; simply because a woman accusing a man is ""always right""; simply because it has been inculcated in this double-standard society that grown men fiddling with boys are somehow worse than grown women doing the same...As proof of this view askew, in the pivotal Hoffman/Streep scene, Flynn is asked whether he gave Donald altar wine to drink. He flatly denies it, ""No."" I watched this movie with a female, who swore that she never heard Flynn deny it and that his assertions of innocence only proved he was guilty of pedophilia straight up. I had to rewind the DVD to prove that Flynn had said ""No"" - to the female's surprise! So even though most of us find Flynn's ordeal intolerable, dealing with the shriking, frigid nun (who needs a good stiff one to stop thinking of other people getting good stiff ones), there will always be females siding with Aloysius from the outset, no proof needed to incarcerate a Man - because his maleness is a sure sign of his guilt.But there is one great surprise in store for all of us. Throughout her insane accusations, Aloysius was always ""certain."" And months after Father Flynn has been ousted from her school (and actually promoted at another diocese), her incredible character arc in the film's final moments suddenly throws us all into Doubt! Now who where wha--?--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Doubt
86,frankde-jong,Not the accusation against the Catholic church that you meybe expecting,8,5 February 2020,"""Doubt"" is a film that manages to mislead his viewers several times. At first you think that it is a film about abuse in the Catholic church, like ""Spotlight"" (2015, Tom McCarthy), but we never really know if Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is guilty. On top of that Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is not tyrannically enough to justify a comparison with Sister Bridget from ""The Magdalene Sisters"" (2002, Peter Mullan).Then you think the film is about a man wrongly accused, like ""Jagten"" (2012, Thomas Vinterberg). Apart from the fact that we never know for sure if the accusations of Sister Aloysius against Father Flynn are false, her accusation certainly do not spread to a brainless crowd, which was the terrifying element of ""Jagten"".After all the answer to the question what the real theme of ""Doubt"" is, is very simple. The real theme of ""Doubt"" is doubt. Father Flynn preaches about doubt in the beginning of the film. Sister Aloysius suffers from doubt at the ending, and the viewer experiences doubt (about the guilt of Father Flynn) during the film.The film is also about dogma (Sister Aloysius) versus renewal (Father Flynn), a theme that was very actual in the Catholic church in the time in which the film is situated. The film is situated in 1964, the time of the Second Vatican Counsel (1962 - 1965). The film tries to illustratie the inflexibility of Sister Aloysius by way of her resistance against the ballpoint pen. Far more telling for me was an intercut between the dinner table of Sister Aloysius (silent, disciplined) and that of Father Flynn (burgundian and animated). It made me think of the fear for a book of Aristotle treating the ""virtue of laughter"" in ""The name of the rose"" (1986, Jean Jacques Annaud).The film has some fine acting (Hoffman and Streep), but the real gem is the cinematography of Roger Deakins (cinematographer of the Coen brothers). The only downside I have discovered were the blowing wind and the thunderbolts accompanying Sister Aloysius. This is a narrative technique more suitable in the horror genre.",Doubt

89,brchthethird,"The winds they are a-changing, and they come sowing the seeds of doubt",10,14 November 2014,"If there ever was a film to make you think seriously about your beliefs, this is the one. DOUBT is a powerhouse of acting talent that tackles issues of faith, certainty and truth head on, and holds the audience responsible for drawing their own conclusions. The story takes place in 1964, at a Catholic school run by Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep): a firm disciplinarian who is very conservative and quick to make judgments based on little to no evidence other than her suspicions. Philip Seymour Hoffman is Father Flynn, who is new to the parish and is more progressive, open-minded and more embracing of life's uncertainties. Amy Adams is Sister James, a young nun who caught between these two people. The catalyst for the plot is the suspicion that Father Flynn may or may not have been improper with the school's only black student. From this comes a battle of wits between Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn, as she accuses the Father of impropriety based on little evidence, and the Father using the ambiguity to his advantage. Despite being dialogue-driven, this is very riveting material and I hung on every word that came out of these thespians' mouths. I also like the way in which things are kept ambiguous, because in real life answers are often hard to come by and sometimes we make decisions based on gut feelings or premonitions, rather than concrete evidence. The film also puts front and center the crisis of faith, and whether or not it is rational (or right) to make heavy decisions based on faith alone. Is doubt permissible in religion, or in a system where one normally takes things on authority? The film raises all of these questions and more, even touching on what has become a well-publicized scandal in the Catholic church: that of sex abuse and pedophilia in the priesthood (although it is only addressed rather obliquely, given the PG-13 rating). Bottom line, if you like to think after watching a movie, and not have it think for you, then this should be right up your alley. Awards-caliber performances and an incredible script make this a must-see.",Doubt
90,jaredmobarak,Killing kindness in the name of virtue  Doubt,9,10 January 2009,"Something about small-scale films adapted from theatre resonates with me. I love the emotional punch packed inside, tightly constructed for a powerful impact. Unlike a novel, plays need to get everything out in a short period of time, and that concentrated energy gets released with so much more weight. What I originally thought would be a back and forth between priest and nun, eventually ending in the truth coming out and all being over, instead becomes an exercise in humanity and ego. Everything we do as people has reasons and consequences, the truth is a strong thing, but speculation is even stronger. When someone gets an idea into his head, he will continue that course of thinking until the end, doing whatever he can to bring the wrongdoer to justice and vindicate the victim. No matter how much that judge may believe he is doing right, the toll and price of his actions may exceed the cost of finding the truth. Because if the truth isn't what he thinks, he will never believe it, therefore making justice void, ruining lives by allowing fear and the unknown take control over the pursuit and achievement of fact.While the idea of child molestation hangs in the balance, on whether this priest began an inappropriate relationship with a boy, it is not the main aspect of the story. Instead, the question of how someone deals with his own doubt comes to the forefront. As Father Flynn, the priest in question played wonderfully by Philip Seymour Hoffman, says early on, doubt can be as powerfully bonding as conviction. You may think it's you versus the world, but there are really so many out there sharing the same questions of faith and action as you. All it takes is one small event, one seemingly innocuous moment to make someone question another's actions. Once the seed of doubt is planted, however, it is very tough to remove, yet rather easy to spread onto others.The film doesn't even really need to tell you if the atrocity in question actually occurred or not, that isn't important. What is crucial becomes how everyone involved deals with the accusations. The power struggle of the church becomes a big factor as you start to question whether the men do have the women pressed under their controlling grip. At multiple instances the regimented structural hierarchy of nun to priest to bishop to pope comes up showing a chain of authority that cannot be questioned at any moment. The format only succeeds if it is followed to the letter, the entire system will topple if anything less occurs.As a result, so much is challenged. Religion, morals, that gray line between right and wrong, whether wrong can somehow be good if you allow yourself to see only the benefits and lie to yourself about the horrors happening along with themthis film will make you look deep inside yourself and wonder how you'd react. Would you be able to go against your vows, against the rules of God that you have followed for so long, in order to seek what you thought was right? Would you question a higher authority's word on a hunch? Would you have that much faith in yourself that he was lying? To be able to fully commit yourself in a course of action, consequences be damned, you must have no doubt at all. However, if at the end things change, if doubts start creeping in, you will be devastatingly lost, always unsure of yourself and whether you can ever trust your gut again.The strength and resolve of a human being is not shown better than in the two final confrontations of this film. Viola Davis is amazing as the possible victim's mother, a woman who is trying to keep her family together and give her son a chance at a life. No matter what is happening, she just needs until June, until he graduates, then he can go away to a good high school and possibly college. She is surviving and hoping her son does as well, because it isn't just the boys in school, or the teachers making accusations on each other around him, but also their home too, with a father that won't except a son who doesn't fit his ideals. When she and Meryl Streep, the nun at the head of Father Flynn's witch trial, have their walk together, that scene becomes the film. Davis, as a mother, begins to go outside the boundaries of that sacred job just as Streep goes out of hers as a nun. The two are so much the same, yet on opposite sides, that it becomes such a powerhouse of emotions and revelations.But it all culminates in the final showdown between Hoffman and Streep, the point at which the film takes a turn I never anticipated it doing. Whether the truth comes out or not, this is a scene containing two of the best, screaming and challenging one another with empty threats, lies, and half-truths. It becomes a test of whether a reputation becomes bigger than the person. Is it worth it to risk shame in order to keep a lie underwraps? Just because there is no proof for guilt doesn't mean the creed ""innocent until proved guilty"" will hold true. Once someone calls another's self into question, once a person's integrity becomes blemished due to fact or fiction, there is no turning back. Like the metaphor of a pillow's feathers flying across town, unable to be retrieved, gossip spreads like wildfire and it can never be overturned. People will always think twice, but it also works the other way too. If everyone seems to feel that person is just, and it's only you who thinks differently, well then the guilt all of a sudden transfers. It begins to eat away at you as you wonder if all that work, all those sacrifices with their dire consequences, were for nothing.",Doubt
91,sharky_55,The wind took them all over.,9,4 November 2016,"One of the reasons I admire films like Cavalry, The Sessions and Gran Torino is because they have the gall to consider Catholic priests as human beings. Like any other characters they have their own secrets and insecurities, their own biases, their own moralities to wrest with. In films such as these they are rendered imperfect by God's designation, not fully equipped to provide all the right answers to a world ridden with corruption and sin. And who could indeed? They are a refreshing change from the often prudish, stuffy figures that roam the church halls - and that goes for nuns as well. The characters in Doubt, even Sister James as the youngest and most naive, all possess an awareness of the issue that they are discussing, even as it hangs uncomfortably in the air without being explicitly addressed. All of them can broach the possibility that even a pious man like Flynn could do such a despicable thing. Although we now know the appalling and wide-reaching extent of the abuses within the Catholic church, Shanley's play does not fashion itself as an exposé, perhaps because that would err towards objectivity - and no one would pay money to watch a police investigation. Hoffman, the best actor of the aforementioned esteemed group, is allowed to live and breathe before any accusations are thrown at him. His booming sermons showcase an aura of authority as he appeals to his audience to trust in solidarity in times of doubt and uncertainty. But his sensitivity towards his students also indicates that he cares strongly for them, and how he is finely attuned to their needs; he uses humour to disarm them and then himself, and to assuage them of all the worries that boys bother themselves with. There is a fantastic showing of his reputation when Sister James and Aloysius arm themselves to confront him in his office, and Streep makes a big fuss of his tea, flustered and stumbling over her words. They both know that for a woman to accuse a man is a much more precarious situation than if the roles were reversed. A clever move from Shanley is to place Amy Adams in the middle of this confrontation. She plays Sister James with bright, pleading eyes and a tittering sing-song about her voice, and who would rather discipline with that than the cane. As the strong personalities clash she bumbles about, trying to use tea to temper the anger that stirs them, and practically leaps up in relief when it appears that the matter was a simple miscommunication. Beyond the scene, throughout the film, she wavers between the priest and the nun, constantly switching sides and attempting to find her own place in the confusion. She finds that the trick with the pope's reflection is useful for disciplining her students, and yet condemns herself for raising her voice in the same demonic manner that Aloysius wields. James' own disposition doesn't afford her the malice that Flynn utilises when he addresses the evils of gossip and slander, but she asserts herself in her own way, and in a tearful and trembling profession, asks us to reconsider the importance of Aloysius' own biases and grudges. Another character that is going through the trials of bargaining is the mother of Donald, played by Viola Davis. By the time she makes her first and only appearance the film has somewhat realigned the audience towards Streep, by revealing under the draconian strictness a steadfast devotion to the well-being of her students, at whatever the cost. Shanley has doled out little hints and flashes of Flynn's behaviour that may well deserve suspicion (each line of dialogue is laced with suggestion from the point onwards - taking the boys on a camping trip, dressing them up for the pageant). So we react in the same manner that Streep does, horrified that any mother would brush aside the implication that their son was being abused. Then Viola Davis speaks powerfully and simply. She unearths an entire world of weight and burden that she faces as a result of her gender and race, and how this has forced her hand to make a deal that no mother should have to make, and choose the lesser of two evils. It is a stunning slap in the face for those who have shouted for an hour over the moral high ground that the church should take, but have not paused to consider the tremendously difficult choices that Mrs Miller must make. The film's power comes predominately in its script and performances, no surprise in a stage adaptation. Shanley, in collaboration with three giants in Deakins, Shore and Tichenor, brings his story to the screen. There are visual tricks to indulge in: canted angles to imply stress and tension, angled shots from above and below to suggest power, motifs of wind and light (see how Aloysius uses the act of opening a window as an accusation), and the distinctly cinematic sequence which visualises the dangers of a whispered allegation. What is more vital to the narrative is how Shanley evokes a specific period in America, one where a nation, largely unscathed from the World War and enjoying economic prosperity, had been shaken by the assassination of their president and were moving into a time of uncertainty. In an era where civil rights and feminist movements were still raging on, we see these macro struggles re-imagined in the everyday lives of these characters, and how it advises caution in their steps. Sister Aloysius, in her determination to uncover what she believes has taken place, finds herself dealing in minor sins in order to expose major ones, and discovers that rigid religious order can often give way to moral convictions. ""Did you ever prove it to anyone but yourself?"", asks Sister James, and we see that she is haunted by all she has done, and all that she might not have.",Doubt
92,TOMASBBloodhound,Was there ever any Doubt? This was a great film from the start.,9,24 June 2012,"Writer/director John Patrick Shanley hits all the right notes in this drama about potential abuse at a Catholic middle school. Phillip Seymour Hoffman (playing much older than he is) plays Father Flynn. Flynn is the leader of a parish that seems out of step with the changing times of the 1960s. His pleasant demeanor and friendliness toward the children draw the ire of Sister Beauvier (Streep) who seems as rigid and set in her ways as a statue. One day an alter boy shows up to class with wine on his breath after being summoned to Flynn's office alone. Though there is no real evidence of any wrongdoing from Father Flynn, Sister Beauvier uses this incident for an opening to try and have him removed. Though this action flies completely in the face of proper procedure and chain of command, the appearance of a scandal would be ruinous to Father Flynn. He denies any wrong-doing, yet Sister Beauvier will do whatever it takes to keep pressing the issue. This sets up a dramatic conclusion that took me a bit by surprise, though it is not clear exactly what we know for sure about each character by the film's final frame.Doubt seems different than other films dealing with abuse by clergy members. In films like Sleepers or Primal Fear, we the audience are dragged through the depths of all kinds of depraved behavior and allegations. Here, I don't even recall hearing the word ""molestation"". All of the accusations are implied through ominous glances, lowered voices, and words like ""inappropriate conduct"". We know what Sister Beauvier thinks Father Flynn may have done, but she never spells it out in exact terms. The film gives us a gripping view of a repressed world that attempts to shut out the world outside it. Anyone like Father Flynn who might bring even a secular Christmas Carol into the Christmas pageant is a definite threat to someone like Sister Beauvier.Spoilers ahead!! Does Father Flynn molest the boy in question? Probably not. He does strongly deny it. However, Sister Beauvier seems to bluff Father Flynn into opening up about his past in a manner that brings his word into question. So much so that he is forced to resign. This was a shocking development for this author, and it may in fact be a reminder of just how wide-ranging these kinds of scandals have been within the Catholic Church. To this day, millions and millions of dollars have been paid in settlements to victims of abuse. And even the nicest of clergymen may not be completely trustworthy. Perhaps at the root of this film is Shanley's agreement with the assertion that maybe its time for the church to do some real changing. Maybe priests should be allowed to marry as they originally were. It is just too difficult to ask even the most faithful servants of God to repress their human desires for life.Doubt is a fine film with top-notch acting and it paints a reportedly accurate picture of Catholic schools at this time. Streep and Hoffman are excellent, and perhaps Oscar-worthy. Amy Adams shines in support, too. Go see this fine film! 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Doubt
93,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An acting tour-de-force with thrilling ambiguity at its core.,10,16 May 2020,"Years before Spotlight (2015) won the Oscar for Best Picture, Doubt (2008) took a hard look at the scandals that have been in the Catholic Church for some time and presented a gripping parable of gossip versus evidence. Aside from this central point, I found Doubt to be a fantastic movie filled with contrasts. The differences between male and female leaders in the Church only heightened the fundamental conflict between Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters. Add to this the hardline stance of Streep's Sister Aloysius, who has no flexibility for rules that aren't actually in the Bible, and the result is an incredible look into changing times.Aside from Streep and Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis also gave superb performances full of raw and heartfelt emotion. In fact, I'd recommend everyone watch this film just for the career-defining roles of these individuals. Even among these, the intense ambiguity involved with Doubt's core premise is a testament to the excellent writing present within its screenplay. The fact that the cinematography used Dutch angles and other film techniques to sow discord and unease to such a significant effect enhances the source material even more than the stage could ever produce.While there are no direct answers or consolations for the turmoil of the Church in this movie, it is slightly disheartening to see any doubt arise amongst the Church's leaders in the first place. Sure, there is a need to break into the modern world and reach modern people, but if this is at the cost of looser morals, do the ends justify the means? It's disheartening to live in a time where trusted leaders in a community will always have the squinted eye of suspicion because of others who have abused their power. Then again, to sin is to be human, so nobody should be above suspicion in this fallen world.An acting tour-de-force with thrilling ambiguity at its core, I give Doubt 5.0 stars out of 5.",Doubt
94,cultfilmfan,Doubt,10,3 January 2009,"Doubt is based upon the play of the same name by John Patrick Shanley who also wrote the film's screenplay and was the director as well. It takes place in 1964 at a Catholic school where after some suspicious behaviour, the school's priest Father Brendan Flynn is brought to the school's principal Sister Aloysius Beauvier who accuses him of abusing the one African American student that the school has. The boy's teacher Sister James who first brought the awkward behaviour of the boy and Father Flynn to Sister Beauvier's attention is very ready to believe that Flynn is innocent, but Sister Beauvier is not as easily convinced and is set to uncover the truth and find more evidence to prove whether, or not Father Flynn is actually guilty. I think that Doubt much like 2007's There Will Be Blood will divide the movie going audience seeing it for much of the same reasons. Both films are great in my opinion, but both also are very unconventional in their storytelling (which is a trait I admired of both films), but I think also the fact that both films reveal a dark side of human nature are bound to leave some audiences feeling disturbed, or disappointed that the films did not have more of a typical Hollywood ending resolving things and giving the viewer more satisfaction in knowing what really happened. If this is how you like your films then you should probably look elsewhere than with Doubt. This film is really highlighted by a great screenplay that really carries the film. It is good not only for it's top notch writing and dialogue, but also because of the thought provoking, philosophical and disturbingly accurate portrayals of human nature and power. The film mainly consists of just talking between the few main characters that carry the story, but because the situations and conversations between the characters are so riveting and compelling to the more thinking person's audience this film will be just as captivating and even at times thrilling than any summer movie blockbuster. The film moves along at a great pace and because of the style and mood of the film as well as the story, which may sound simple enough on the surface, actually has more thought and depth than most films this year and is completely fascinating because of the dissecting of each of these characters and their true emotions and motives. I also have to mention the acting from the three main leads because they are all at the top of their game here and give much truth and power to the words they are saying by great facial movements, the tone of their voices and body language. The performances are so strong that I am sure they will be nominated for Oscars as many of the performances are already being recognized by other film festival awards. The film's screenplay because of it's rich examination of the human psyche and behaviour as well as it's thought provoking and compelling writing will also no doubt be nominated for a screenplay award. I think the word entertained is the wrong word to describe how I felt during this movie, but perhaps I shall say challenged, riveted and completely fascinated by this excellent study of human nature and the fine performances and writing behind them. The sets and the film's low key and almost drab appearance also completely suit the film with a sombre look and feel that feels completely home for the script and makes the film almost have a cinema verite look to it and makes it feel all the more real, which I thought suited it perfectly. This was an ideal night out at the movies for myself, but for those who like more upbeat, traditional and straight forward storytelling you may have to look elsewhere.

95,Danusha_Goska,Must See for Streep's Performance,8,27 December 2008,"Meryl Streep's riveting, razor sharp performance as an old-school Catholic nun is reason enough to see ""Doubt."" Streep rises above very good material and her costars, the adorable and much praised Amy Adams and the Academy-Award-winning Phillip Seymour Hoffman. These formidable stars might as well not even be on screen while Meryl is doing her stuff. I'm not a Streep groupie, and her accents have sometimes annoyed me, but you've got to surrender your praise to Streep for her complete inhibiting and vivification of Sister Aloyisius.John Patrick Shanley's direction of Streep only adds to her power. She is first seen only partially: the back of a black habit on the margins of the frame. The black habit proceeds up the aisle of a packed Catholic church, a hand reaches out and smacks heads where the judicious application of the flat of her hand would stiffen some weakening, macaroni spines. I have to confess that I have reprimanded young people today for their often utterly nauseating misbehavior in church. Kids behave better in movie theaters than during transubstantiation. I could only admire Sister Aloyisius' focus and righteous power.Production values support Shanley's vision. ""Doubt"" is a modest film. Its Catholic church, Catholic school, and working class, Catholic neighborhood, complete with retro autos, painstakingly recreate 1964.Shanley's play ""Doubt"" won the Pulitzer Prize. It's pretty thin and somewhat gimmicky. Sister Aloyisius suspects Father Flynn of molesting a boy. The play never provides conclusive evidence one way or the other. Shanley wants his audiences to experience doubt, which Shanley prefers to certainty. Certainty is a bad thing, he tells us; it's what got us into the Iraq war. I thought that the election of George Bush got us into the Iraq war; might as well demonize democracy. Shanley is utterly certain of the superiority of certainty, which makes him certain. His own position contradicts itself.Ironically, in his effort to induce doubt in his audience, Shanley has, perhaps inadvertently, done something quite other: he has dramatized a clash between conservatism, in the person of Sister Aloyisius, and liberalism, presented by Father Flynn. Sister Aloyisius insists that to serve people, you must provide them with firm guidelines. You must be willing to be unpopular. You must adhere to timeworn tradition. Flynn wants to serve people by smiling at them, befriending them, hugging them, and letting them sing ""secular, pagan"" songs like ""Frosty the Snowman"" at the Christmas pageant. The competition between right and left is emphasized by literal winds that blow throughout the film. These winds are, of course, ""the winds of change."" Whether Shanley intended it or not, Sister Aloyisius wins this competition hands down. A more handsome and charming star should have been cast as Father Flynn. Phillip Seymour Hoffman simply looks guilty, in the worst way. There is no doubt. He can't well represent the allure of liberalism.Shanley makes another false move. Sister Aloyisius suspects Flynn of molesting a black boy. ""Doubt"" tells us that a black child is particularly vulnerable because blacks are low man on the totem pole, and might endure abuse for a chance at a brighter future. In fact, the working class Irish, Italians, and Poles who created Catholic parishes were themselves low man on the totem pole, and they endured horrors in Catholic schools because their peasant, immigrant parents and grandparents really believed that it was only by enduring brutality that their children would survive. Sociologists have written at length about this ""internalized oppression."" It is also, simply, factually true that most abuse victims were white, not black, and many parents turned a blind eye because they had been taught to obey unquestioningly. Politically Correctness tells us that blacks, and blacks alone, are America's oppressed, and Shanley internalizes this falsehood to jazz up his play.",Doubt
96,jem132,Compelling,8,2 February 2009,"Very strong drama with Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman doing some great work as the rigid nun and the progressive priest who are at loggerheads. The subject matter of the film is very delicate, but handled well, and it is very gripping to watch. I'm not sure what to think of Amy Adams' performance. With those big blue eyes and sweet face she's very appealing, but she never really hits great heights in this film. Solidly directed, if a little obvious (the thunderstorm motif gets a little old, as do the angles mixed in with close-ups for a little variety). But the best part, and the key to this film, is the acting of the two leads, and they excel. Streep never makes a caricature out of her stern nun, and we never quite know what to think of Hoffman.

98,EijnarAmadeus,Dungeons and dragons.,7,2 February 2009,"So much remains unanswered in John Patrick Shanley's DOUBT, a theater-drama turned into one of the most brilliant films of 2008. It's a film that creates tension within its restrictions, the restrictions of a 1960s Catholic school and the tensions when Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep) accuses Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) for having intimate relations with a young black boy student. Shanley's script doesn't go searching for an answer, instead it digs deep into the conversations and the changing times that stirs inside the school's walls.Philip Seymour Hoffman is absolutely piercing, he doesn't match the conservativeness of Sister Aloysius, he is a far more liberal catholic that sees the change of times, and feels like adding ""Frosty the Snowman"" to the school-choir's Christmas concert, allowing ballpoint pens and admitting to be a ""sweet-tooth"" when adding three spoons of sugar to his tea. It is one of the most difficult characters Hoffman's portrayed, and once again, he proves his enormous talent. The rest of the cast is absolutely superb; Meryl Streep, who buries all those Mamma Mia memories and earning herself a Oscar-nomination, a carefully layered Amy Adams as Sister James and Viola Davis, as the black boy's mother Mrs. Miller, entering the scene for one of the most electrifying film-scenes of last year.It's tone is shadowy, silent and absolutely autumnal with Roger Deakins once again working at the peak of his powers. The screenplay provides powerful and thoughtful questions of faith, whether it's whispering words in the corridors or preaching on the high-chair, and when Hoffman and Streep clash, expect a confrontational rampage.",Doubt
99,barryrd,Great acting but no resolution,8,19 November 2009,"When I watched Doubt, memories from a Catholic childhood came flooding back of the nuns and priests I knew at a parish church and its school. As in the movie, the school and church were located on one property but the authorities were separate and there was a respectful distance between them. This protocol is followed up to the point where Sister Aloysius feels she has no other alternative but to break through the bounds. Her actions are what any Catholic parent would expect when scandal reared up or was suspected. Meryl Streep as Sister Aloysius brought to mind the old-style nuns who enforced discipline in the Catholic school. The Father Flynns of the time, as portrayed in this movie by Philip Seymour Hoffman, were the nice guys who had a guarded respect for the nuns and one suspects that even they would have trouble measuring up to their standards. The raucous dinner at the rectory with drinking and off-colour banter was in sharp contrast to the regimented dinner routine of the nuns.The nuns were reminiscent of what I recall: the emphasis on penmanship, the vigilant attention to the children at mass, the eyes in the back of the head trick...all so typical. Sister Aloysius was an embodiment of every sister superior - the demeanour, the glaring, the sarcastic language. Meryl Streep had these down to a tee. Into this early 1960's school, we are introduced to a potential scandal involving the alleged abuse of a black student. Once the scandal became the focus, we somehow find that the peaceful coexistence between nuns and priests is shattered. Is Father Flynn the victim of a nun's suspicious imagination or is Sister Aloysius the voice of justice with an intuitive knowledge of vice hiding under a liberal priest voicing good intentions. The questions abounded and were sharpened by the characters of Sister James, performed by Amy Adams, and Mrs. Miller, mother of the child, performed by Viola Davis. The acting is first-rate and the atmosphere recaptures a time when Irish and Italian families depended on Catholic nuns to give their children not only a moral foundation but social skills as well. These elements are reinforced by a clever screenplay that captures the details of a particular time and place. I did find one flaw however in the use of the word ""boy"" by the nuns. This was one thing I never once encountered. My instinctive sympathy was with Sister Aloysius but there was no real evidence against Father Flynn. The nun was flawed but tried to follow her conscience; however, we are unable to make a full judgement about the priest. The ambivalence of the film leaves the viewer confused particularly at the end. This seems unfair to the audience which wants to know the facts on which to base a judgement. The lack of any resolution leaves a gap in a movie that otherwise shone in many other respects.",Doubt
100,jdkraus,There's NO DOUBT this will get some Oscar recognition,9,26 December 2008,"I've known for a long time that the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards often pick the glossy, limited released dramas over the big blockbusters (save for ""The Lord of the Rings"" films). I always enjoyed a good drama, and ""Doubt"" drew my attention. Nominated for 5 Golden Globes, it rightfully deserves its recognition.What makes this film so great is the intense and electrifying performances by some very fine actors. I really can't say who I loved the most. Meryl Streep (who I consider one of the greatest actresses of all time) once again proves her talent, portraying a hard and determined Nun who seeks the truth about a questionable relationship between a young African-American student and the school's priest (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Meryl Streep is not only great in this role because she has a great background of mesmerizing performances, but she adds depth to her character. She reminds me much of an old teacher that would be any child's worst nightmare, yet at the same time she portrays herself as a human being who seeks truth and justice. As for Hoffman, he's basically the guy anyone likes. He's funny and energetic, but reveals his true colors in the end of the film. Amy Adams, who I've only seen in a couple of films, is another grand addition to the film. Of all the characters, I think hers has the most depth because she starts off as a naïve, innocent, cheerful nun who enjoys ""simplicity"" but is drawn into conflict as the drama unfolds and is not sure on who to believe or how to react. I've never heard of Viola Davis, but as Mrs. Miller, the mother of the African-American student, her twenty minutes in the film, can lead a very promising career as a great actress.In addition with all of these excellent performances, I personally enjoyed how the film goes in deep with what a Catholic school is like. It is all organized, the nuns have to get up at a certain time, the student's have to wear uniforms, and there's corporal punishment. It also depicts the prejudice between the nuns and the priest. With the dinner scenes for example, the nuns eat simple food (which the film shows as something indigestible), and the priest gets a special dinner of red meat. He enjoys himself with his plentiful food while the nuns are quiet and trying to swallow their meager meals. It also brings into question on whether Catholicism is following the path of the bible, or just a way to promote their priests and earn money. Adding to the subtleties, Roger Deakins work of cinematography adds to the mood of the film. The night's are obviously dark, bleak, and mysterious but during the days, he puts a lot of emphasis on light, but not so much that it is bright and colorful like ""The Wizard of Oz"", rather it is muted and holds a depressing tone like in ""The Pianist"". This color also helps shape the film's plot but also with the constant symbolism that is shown throughout the film via the weather. John Patrick Shanley's direction is decent, but I felt there were too many cuts used between the scenes of dialog. I would have rather he focused on a couple of wide shots and then some medium or up-close shots on the characters of the scene to capture the emotion of the film very much like Kurosawa did in Ran. And for a 104 minute film, it seemed a little slow, but overall, ""Doubt"" is an excellent film. I hope that Meryl Streep earns another Oscar, Amy Adams receives one for her brilliant work, and perhaps Roger Deakins can finally get one. I won't bet on best picture though.",Doubt
101,JohnRayPeterson,The perfect title. The movie is deliberately ambiguous and astutely ambivalent.,9,9 April 2011,"The perfect title. The movie is deliberately ambiguous and astutely ambivalent.After watching, only just recently, this movie, I tried hard to figure out why it was so good; I did not dismiss the quality of the actors of course but I somehow suspected there was more to it than that. The dialogs were not compelling, so it was something else; the subject matter was not one that would be inspiring or revealing, so again it had to be something else. Great performances by actors was too obvious. Then I read some critics and reviews hoping for a clue; so many varied opinions on the movie's message almost made me wonder if I watched the same movie. The title was the clue I was looking for.I believe the words not spoken, the limitation of many of the scenes and the omission of clarity when we crave it was intentional; the more is left to the imagination the stronger the connection to the reader or moviegoer will be. The director has certainly the experience to use that knowledge, and in my opinion, he has, very effectively. As Sister Aloysius breaks down, in the last scene (refer to the storyline), with the admission that she had some doubts, the dramatic revelation has the desired climactic result, hence my choice of ""perfect title"" for a review summary.For those who read my review summary/heading and immediately think you're reading an oxymoron, you are. Its use is not a grammatical error if written or spoken intentionally, as is the case here. It not only is a grammatical error when it is not deliberately said, it is also a clue to the speaker or author's degree of intellect.I don't need to elaborate on the point that Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman delivered outstanding performances because that has been repeated profusely in the hundreds of reviews since listed in IMDb, and I share those opinions; I'll add that Amy Adams also performed superbly, it's not just my opinion because her supporting role received the same awards recognition as that of Seymour Hoffman.Finally, I'd be remiss not to mention the scene featuring Viola Davis (Mrs Miller) and Meryl Streep, since it merited Davis an Oscar nomination. Davis has only two scenes in the movie, the other ten seconds appearance is negligible. That scene is one of the two most dramatic moments of the movie because they are both thought provoking. If you were raised Catholic and if acts of defamation or slander raise your blood pressure as it does mine, watch this movie; you'll not be disappointed.",Doubt

The novice nun seems naive and weak. Through the course of the film, these characters develop and show surprising new sides to their character. Much of this film is riveting and uncomfortable to watch. In the end, the outcome is very clear, and yet it remains ambiguous. The priest was obviously guilty. The nun who succeeded in getting him removed from the parish still has her doubts. All the emotions in this film are authentic. The outcome, in light of past lawsuits against diocese for protecting pedophile priests is true. Realistic and disturbing.",Doubt
103,skepticskeptical,Unpleasant,6,10 February 2020,"Meryl Streep channels Louise Fletcher´s Nurse Ratched in this bizarre tale of suspicion--and what not--in a world with a serious joy deficiency. But is Doubt, as the name implies, really a tale of epistemology or is it, rather, a scathing critique of the repressed sexuality of females who betroth the church as nuns? I ask this because the Amy Adams character is equally unpleasant to behold, in her own pathetic way. In fact, the women in this film are all deeply flawed, even the mother of the young black boy woven into Sister Aloysius´ colorful fantasy in which Father Flynn has seduced him. One of the older nuns is going blind and is, as she put it, ¨bushwhacked¨ by a branch falling from a tree, after which that plotline is dropped completely, and she disappears altogether. So perhaps that scene was intended purely as a metaphor supporting what I suspect (mere suspicion, not certainty!) to have been the director´s intention in mounting this piece.I will not watch Doubt again because I found it neither enlightening nor entertaining. What´s the point? The acting by Philip Seymour Hoffman (RIP) was good, as usual. He also played the only likable character, and with whom it was possible to sympathize in a world being run by a delusional, intransigent termagant.",Doubt
104,moviesleuth2,Doubt,7,12 June 2009,"FDR said that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. However, in many cases, doubt is just as ominous and destructive. Uncertainty can be a terrible thing; just ask anyone who has to wait for their college admissions letter. Or, in a more applicable sense, someone who is waiting for the verdict of their trial.Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the progressive priest at St. Nicholas' School. His positive and lax attitude towards life and religion makes him an enemy of Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep), who has the spirit of a religious fanatic. But when Sister James (Amy Adams) sees a student acting suspiciously after a private meeting with Father Flynn, Sister Aloysius becomes certain that what happened in that room was not just a ""talk,"" but rather something more unsavory...If anything, ""Doubt"" makes us remember how good our justice system is. You can't be convicted (or charged) with a crime without any evidence. There's no evidence anything bad happened during the incident in question, but Sister Aloysius becomes so certain of Father Flynn's guilt that she'll do anything to be proved right.As ridiculous and absurd as this attitude may be, it's not unbelievable (of course, it helps that Sister Aloysius is played by Meryl Streep). Recently, I read a book detailing the events of the Duke Lacrosse scandal, and I couldn't help noticing the similarities. There was little credible evidence, but at the hands of a stubborn prosecutor, lives and reputations were severely damaged. Sister Aloysius is a dead ringer for Mike Nifong (the prosecutor in the case); once she's certain about something, she doesn't stop looking for answers until she gets the one she wants. Any lives or reputations that are destroyed are collateral damage.The three principal characters are symbolic. Sister Aloysius is reactionism, Father Flynn is progression, and Sister James is the innocence that is caught in a dangerous position in the battle between the two. The genius of John Patrick Shanley's play is the ability to create three dimensional characters while still recognizing them as these symbols.""Doubt"" would not have had the same impact that it has had it not been for an outstanding cast. Ask anyone who the greatest living film actress is, and chances are that many would say Meryl Streep. I don't think that she has the capacity to give a bad performance. Creating a three-dimensional character out of someone who has only a single purpose in a story's plot is a difficult task. But if anyone can pull it off, it's Meryl Streep. When Father Flynn says ""The dragon is hungry"" when Sister Aloysius calls a student to her office, you know exactly what he's talking about. Speaking of Philip Seymour Hoffman...I have to say that I previously was not a fan of the actor. While he is very talented, early in his career he displayed a propensity for the weird, anti-social and otherwise bizarre characters that earned him a big name in the independent film circuit, and his beating Heath Ledger out of a much-deserved Oscar in 2006 made me like him even less. But I'm quickly warming up to him, and his performance in ""Doubt"" furthers that trend. Father Flynn is a genial man, who's the complete opposite of his nemesis, Sister Aloysius. He's what we want to believe all priests are like. This makes it easier to sympathize with him. He has great chemistry with everyone in the cast, and his scenes with Streep are dynamite. Amy Adams is terrific as the perfectly innocent Sister James. It's through her that we see everything, and Sister James is a wonderful guide. Like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Viola Davis made her name in the art-house circuit. However, her performance in ""Doubt"" made her the talk of the Oscars, and while she lost to Penelope Cruz, her performance should open a lot of doors for her. She's only on for two scenes (the latter of which is only a brief appearance, and she doesn't say anything), but she dominates it. Especially noteworthy is that she's with Meryl Streep. While it is a good performance, people that say that she stole the scene from Streep. This is true, although it is partly because Davis' character is more forceful (at the time).Of all the people to adapt and direct a film based on a play, who better than the person who wrote it in the first place (provided they have experience behind the camera)? While he does good work in his treatment of his Pulitzer-Prize winning play, there are times when Shanley becomes a little self-indulgent. He uses some ""unique"" camera angles that don't really add much to the story, among other things. Additionally, some of the revelations are not clear.""Doubt"" is good film, but not a perfect one.",Doubt

106,ThurstonHunger,Punish or Parish...,9,20 December 2009,"As an agnostic, doubt for me flickers like a flame on my mind, like the Holy Spirit flickers on the tongue of believers. As a film-goer, ""Doubt"" delivered a gripping, wrenching and nearly pitch-perfect experience.Rare is the (American) film, that strives for no clear resolution. Rare is the film where four actors deservedly were up for Oscars. And as much has been properly made of the dialog in this film (not a surprise for an adapted play), but what of the monologues? Where can you find them these days? John Patrick Shanley seized upon the sermon as a bully pulpit for one perhaps being bullied, but surely for an opportunity for someone to have an amazing monologue. Three of them, each speaking differently to those in the film and those of us outside it.I hesitate to write more for fear of spoilers, more than for fear of a wrathful God. I wonder if perhaps as a lapsed Catholic and a lapsed rhetorician (some may argue which is the greater sin)...I wonder if perhaps this film is too well aimed at me. Would my Muslim and/or Jewish friends find this as a compelling as I did? And my wife did...although we drew decidedly different conclusions at the film's end.Hmmm, I left out the Atheists (and Zoroastrians and Coptics etc...) but I would truly recommend this film to all my friends. I remember as I became a father 7+ years ago, I wondered how my complicated relationship with doubt would fair. I had seen others who upon reaching parenthood, cast aside all doubt (while not all childish things). This film is more than a whodunnit, more than an ifdunnit, but it is an opportunity for a discussion on doubt, something I cherish and fear.On a less personal level, this film also might be a springboard for a discussion of Vatican II (is this the prequel ;>). I actually have heard that term used before and not really known much about it (Hey I was weeks old at its perhaps-less-than-immaculate conception). Two other small notes...1) If, like my wife, you were worried about the potential for this film to lapse into popular priestly perversion, I think you are safe. That is not to say you won't feel squeamish at times...2) I read at least one other review citing Shanley's larger body of work. I too was curious upon the completion of the film, what else he had worked on...but the other IMDb entries showed *nothing* in line with the quality of this film. 9/10 Thurston Hunger",Doubt
107,WriterDave,Perhaps We're not Meant to Sleep so Well...,8,21 December 2008,"It seemed rather fitting that I saw ""Doubt"" on the first day of winter, the sun making its shortest visit of the year, the advancing cold indicative of the looming incertitude of the characters in the film. This is the second film in a row after ""Frost/Nixon"" that has been adapted from an award-winning play. Unlike that film, ""Doubt"" is directed by the playwright, John Patrick Shanley. Wisely he employs the best in the bizz, cinematographer Roger Deakins, to translate his theatrics into film language. The crooked camera angles, the overt symbolism of storms approaching, windows blowing open, snow covering the ground, crows squawking, and lights blowing out, all smack the viewer in the face. There's no denying what lies at the heart of ""Doubt."" Set in New York in 1964, the film tells the story of Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep acting in her wheelhouse), the principal of Saint Nicholas' School, who begins to suspect the new priest (Philip Seymour Hoffman, insidiously innocuous) is developing an inappropriate relationship with one of the altar boys, who also happens to be the school's first African-American student. The naive Sister James (a perfectly cast Amy Adams) is at first pulled into Sister Aloysius' plot to uncover the truth, but soon falls under the priest's spell and is convinced of his innocence. But things aren't so cut and dry, and soon both women are riddled with doubt after being so certain they were on the side of the just.Some have claimed Streep's performance verges on camp and that the film relies too much on Gothic overtones. However, anyone who was raised Catholic and attended Catholic school knew a nun just like her (mine was Sister Laboure), and her portrayal of a domineering principal who still defers to a higher power is nothing short of brilliant. Also, the Gothic nature of the film falls right in line with the traditions of Catholicism as it subtly hints at other crimes and sins in its sly treatment of secondary characters and plot lines that stir the audience's imaginations not unlike Henry James worked readers into a tizzy with ""The Turn of the Screw"" over one hundred years earlier. Yes, there are moments where the film plays like a psychological thriller, and that's part of its brilliance, for in no other way can we come to accept the sins but in the guise of horror.Like ""Notes on a Scandal"" the film uses a salacious topic as a vehicle for an acting showcase. The fireworks amongst the three leads are worth the price of admission alone. In its treatment of the Catholic child abuse scandal, the film accurately portrays how insular the Church was (and still is) from the rest of the world and how easy it was for the accusations to be never voiced properly, or if they were, swept under the rug. In its closing scene of Streep and Adams finding solace in each other's doubts on a bench in the dead of winter, Shanley seems to beg the audience for a little bit of sympathy on behalf of the Church. However, it left me thinking of an earlier scene where Hoffman's priest asked Streep's nun, ""Where is your compassion?"" To which Streep replied, ""Nowhere you can get at it."" Perhaps any sympathy should be showered on the victims...for I feel nothing for the Church. ""Doubt"" will leave you chilled, and like the Sisters, perhaps we're not meant to sleep so well as long as the crimes continue.",Doubt
108,LoneWolfAndCub,A compelling story which is further helped by intense performances and a tight script,10,10 January 2009,"After leaving the cinema, upon Doubt finishing rather powerfully, my friend and I had a half hour long discussion about what we had just seen. This talk further made me realise just how good the film is, and how rich and layered it is. Based off a stage play (of the same name) by John Patrick Stanley, Doubt centres on Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), the principal of St. Nicholas Catholic School. Sister Aloysius runs a tight ship, ensuring everything is done in an old-fashioned style (no ballpoint pens, no Frosty the Snowman as he is a heretic, etc) and that the children are afraid of her. Young Sister James (Amy Adams) is a sweet and innocent woman who stumbles across something she has suspicions about, that one of the priests, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is having an immoral relationship with the only Negro student. She informs Sister Aloysius of what she witnessed and so begins an attempt to bring him down.It is hard to believe this is Stanley's second feature film as a director, as this is so well-made in all aspects. The acting is uniformly amazing from the cast, with Streep and Hoffman in top form, and Adams proving herself a talented young woman. However, it is a newcomer that is particularly pleasing, Viola Davis as Mrs. Miller, the mother of the boy, gives an emotional and mesmerising performance for her short amount of screen-time (I smell an Oscar nod here). I would not be surprised if the actors from this film sweep the awards' ceremonies. The script is incredible and provides the film's most tense and riveting scenes, especially towards the end. Furthermore, there is some subtle symbolism and imagery throughout the film which really adds an incredible amount of depth and leads to some great discussions. The cinematography is totally suited to the tone of the film, and Roger Deakins seems to be the man to go to for perfect filming. Howard Shore's score is in the same boat, suited and quite unnerving at time, leaving feelings of uncertainty throughout.Doubt is entirely based around its title, and I found myself feeling it for the entirety of the movie as much as the characters were. It is a movie where it is hard to take sides with the characters, because they all have their many positives and negatives, their flaws and strengths. Not enough can be said in any review about how good this film is, and I will wrap up by stating that this is by far the best film of 2008 from what I have seen.5/5",Doubt

It lacks depth and subtlety to manage to captivate the viewer's attention, disillusioned by such a linear and conventional script, from which one doesn't get any message or opinion.Let's also note the last scene between the two sisters, frankly ridiculous, almost like a parody.A pretty disappointing movie all in all, that will be remembered more for its form than its content.",Doubt

Her love and need for simplicity is heartbreaking. Never do you want to take your eyes off her. Viola Davis, in her one scene wonder, gives a masterclass on acting.

In the way of an actress, I really do but, I don't like her take on the performance. I've never seen Cherry Jones in the original stage version so I have no base for comparison but Streep may have overdone it a tad. Worthy of a nomination? Definitely. Should she win the Oscar? Absolutely not. She commands the screen like always but when it comes to bare emotion. It doesn't really work. I don't know, its just something that didn't feel as natural as I would have liked it to be.Screenplay is top notch and expect director John Patrick Shanley to get the nomination for adapting his own play. However, his direction on the film isn't as strong as it could have been. It felt like he was just given a slam dunk cast and really all he had to do is sit back and follow the script. Nothing daring about choices he made.The film is solid and actually quite great until that final scene. Loved the idea, but not executed properly. It felt rushed and a bit strange. After that, a bitter sour taste was put in my mouth. But I did enjoy the film very much.***1/2/****",Doubt

115,majikstl,A Reasonable Doubt,8,8 February 2009,"DOUBT is a mystery story. It has a detective who acts on a hunch, and despite a remarkable lack of evidence, pushes and pushes to bring the culprit to justice. But there is a catch, several actually. The detective is a nun and the culprit is a priest. And the culprit might be totally innocent, while the detective might be not only wrong, but emotionally, and perhaps morally, corrupt. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Father Flynn, the gregarious, forward looking priest placed in charge of St. Nicholas parish in the Bronx in 1964. Meryl Streep is Sister Aloysius, the hard-line principal of the church school, who frowns on anything modern, such as ballpoint pens, secular Christmas music and having an open mind. The more Father Flynn strives to make his church more out-going and relaxed, the more stubbornly Sister Aloysius fights to keep the place strictly old-fashioned and demanding. One night over dinner, Sister Aloysius, slyly, almost sinisterly, asks her nuns to keep an eye on Father Flynn's behavior, to look out for anything out of the ordinary. She keeps her suspicions vague. One day, Sister James (Amy Adams), a wide-eyed young novice, notices some odd things in Father Flynn's actions toward a young boy, Donald Miller, the only black child in the school. Nothing that Sister James sees is particularly strange individually, only when taken as a whole. What develops is a game of cat and mouse, as Sister Aloysius lays out her plan to rid the parish of its young priest. But her every blunt accusation, fragile bit of evidence and determined attack is parried by Father Flynn with simple and logical answers. What the mild-mannered priest can't fight off is the sheer ferocity of the nun's unrelenting sense of righteousness. Whether guilty or innocent, Father Flynn has to face the reality that by simply suggesting impropriety on his part, Sister Aloysius' could scar his career, disrupt the parish and maybe even permanently damage the young boy at the center of the matter. In a typical story such as this, Sister Aloysius would be proved right. No matter how vicious and ruthless the attacks seem, she would be vindicated by her deeply felt passion. And DOUBT certainly plays on that, both because the detective-with-the-hunch is always right in mystery fiction and because of the sordid history of pedophilia within the church. Indeed, Father Flynn's appearance of innocence all but insures that he appears guilty, such is the demand for irony. But John Patrick Shanley, the writer/director of the film and author of the play on which it is based, doesn't play the game that way. Beyond vague circumstantial evidence, there is no real proof of Father Flynn's guilt, other than the intense certainty of Sister Aloysius' assertions. And certainly the sister is carrying a lot of emotional baggage going into the fray, as Father Flynn represents everything she fears and hates about the new direction the Church was taking in the 1960s. No matter how profound her belief in Flynn's guilt is, it is far from pure. When she tries to drag Donald's mother into the confrontation, it is obvious that Sister Aloysius' concern for the boy is tentative at best  her victory over Flynn is more important than the honesty of the cause. But even so, Sister Aloysius might be right and Father Flynn might be guilty. Or maybe not. That is what is intriguing about DOUBT; it leaves open all the possibilities. All the way to the end and beyond.To some extent, the deck is stacked against Father Flynn; after all, why make the movie at all if he isn't guilty? Having the part played by Hoffman, given the history of oddball characters he has played, it only adds to the weight of his possible guilt. This forces Streep to overplay her role a bit, but even if she is totally wrong in her approach, Sister Aloysius is right to fight for her belief  and many will leave the movie believing this, that she is a righteous villain. Her means justifies the outcome. A story like this could be infuriating. It is written in generalities and vague innuendo. Pedophilia and molestation is never stated, homosexuality is inferred. That is because this is 1964 and within the confines of the Catholic Church, where such things just weren't uttered aloud. And that approach works in this story, leaving suspicion as little more than a mist across the landscape. There is no clearcut crime or even a clearcut accusation; only the disquieting chill of ""what if.""",Doubt

117,socrates99,Not as edifying an experience as I had hoped,7,13 April 2009,"The idea that a nun might have questioned the behavior of a priest back in the '60s doesn't jive with my personal experience though I admit, that though a Catholic, I did not attend a Catholic primary school. But that's a relatively minor quibble. If I accept that it might have happened at such an early date, then Ms Streep's role would have made much more sense. It's not that she doesn't flesh out her character's personality convincingly. It's just that she would have seemed extraordinarily ahead of her time to me, and the plot makes no attempt to convey anything like that. But then there are problems with the plot itself that add to my general dissatisfaction. Hoffman's character, and Hoffman is quite convincing as a priest, is a little too willing to let himself be accused of harboring improper feelings for one of the students. And though the story is meant to create an atmosphere of doubt, it does so, in my opinion, in a fairly dishonest manner. Still, Amy Adams is quite memorable as the naive newcomer. And there were stretches where I was not wondering about all of the above. In the end I would have changed quite a lot in an attempt to show how difficult it would be to act with so little information. It would not have been the play set to film but another story all together.",Doubt
118,diac228,Um...sir..I believe you are missing some footage...,4,12 January 2009,"The Oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep, engaging, powerhouse ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn Best Picture in the big show. Among them is this film that is based off a very popular and well-acclaimed play. The original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation; which comes as a double-edged sword. On one hand, who better to translate the play than the original writer? On the other hand, who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself? Doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense; with a frustrating ending, unnecessary dialogue, questionable directing, and of course, the inability to provide substantial answers. It is a growing trend among these ""high-caliber"" films to not answer all questions it provides, and this has to stop.Doubt is like a joke without its punch line, like a book with the final 20 pages missing, like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game, and like not having the 50 cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next. Doubt, just like the previous Best Picture frustrationfest No Country For Old Men, doesn't really end; it doesn't provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending. Yes, that was the intent, but this isn't a test of humanity, it's a cop-out. I do not pay money to see an unfinished work, I pay money to see a beginning, middle, and end, and pray that I don't fall asleep during the three acts. We are forced to become the ""writers"" of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other.This little drama is about a nun (Meryl Streep) who seems very sure that the well-beloved priest (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church; the first African-American boy in the Catholic church. The church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyone's backs. The plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently, which attracts the notice of a young teacher (Amy Adams). The story is set right after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other.Doubt's strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever-engaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over. Streep seems to be Oscar-worthy in every role she's in, and here she is no different as her sternness and cold-hearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church. Hoffman excels yet again as the priest, by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura. The seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off, especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time; but Hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers. When these two argue, you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched. But let's not forget Amy Adams (Enchanted) and Viola Davis (Law ad Order) for their superb job either. Doubt's casting ensemble is among the best in 2008.Yet, like previously stated it's the writing and directing that ruins this film, especially when dwindling down the third act. Questions pop up, but they aren't answered. Characters pop up, but provide no real enhancement towards the plot. Kids behave different, but we never truly find out why. There are awkward angles in the camera-workandthere's no actual reason why. John Patrick Shanley, the writer of the play, had one previous film in his directing repertoire: Joe Versus the Volcano. Whether sheer arrogance or stupidity, we are stuck with seeing overdrawn sequences of random conversation, utter annoying chatter that bores to no end (There was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted) thanks to Mr. Shanley.Bottom Line: The lack of an ending is a stupid trend that's just as irritating as the seizureific camera-work in action films. It doesn't matter that we have a great talented acting cast, or decent cinematography, or a good story being worked upon, or good usage of sound and music; because we have a barrage of unanswered questions that sprinkles all over a film that is over 100 minutes yet doesn't even finish! The translation from play to film is good and quite accurate, because we have the original madmen behind the projectbut he took the mistakes and stupid hiccups from the play to the film as well. This decade has seen its share of blockbuster and high-profile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end: Sideways, Cast Away, No Country For Old Men, Burn After Reading are a few examples.Newsflash: end your stinkin' movie. Please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank (like Wall-E's depressing backstories), instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of emptiness, confusion, and mental anguish. Have a beginning, middle, and the end please!! As a critic, I prefer my films to be whole, not incomplete. Doubt feels incomplete, which is why it gets an incompetent grade.Someone has to break this stupid trend.",Doubt
119,eddax,I have doubts... about the movie.,7,27 May 2009,"Perhaps John Patrick Shanley should've left the direction of his play/screenplay to a better director because I have to say that apart from the stellar acting, I was quite underwhelmed with the movie. Apparently only the actor who plays the priest knows if he's guilty or not but hello, all signs point to ""Yes."" So there's a distinct lack of doubt right there, though, that's of course not the only doubt Shanley refers to but it is the overlying one. Shanley's also quite heavy-handed with his symbolism, with recurring big winds and exploding light bulbs.But the actors save the movie, and how could they not, being three huge stars and one new one. Meryl Streep can do no wrong and she disappears fully into her righteous head nun role. It is a role that unfortunately borders on caricature though, and her expressions and words perhaps bring too much humor into a somber movie. At least Streep has good scenes against all three of main co-stars in which they play off each other and bring out their best.I'm not really sure if I should blame Shanley or Philip Seymour Hoffman for the overly obvious guilt of his priest. His is also the performance I least appreciate but that may be because it is an understated one. Even when he finally admits defeat to Streep, Hoffman is a tad too subdued. Though, now that I think about it, maybe it's because Streep and her character chewed him up and spat him out.It is to Amy Adams credit that she can earn an Oscar nomination for essentially a more dramatic version of Giselle in Enchanted, since here she's also an innocent who eventually realizes that the world is not sunshine and roses. Or maybe this nomination is for both roles. In any case, Adams fills the role perfectly, though I have to say her work in Junebug was more poignant and memorable.Doubt's breakout star is Viola Davis, perhaps because her performance is short yet powerful and what she says is not what you'd expect, and is hence even more memorable. But I don't want to take away credit from Davis herself, who embodies the role of a mother who just wants the best for her son, no matter how unconventional the means.I'm a little torn about this movie. While I didn't care much for how it played out, I loved Streep and Davis in it. But I guess actors can only go so far in redeeming a movie.",Doubt
120,kijii,Powerfully dramatic battle of wills between a nun and her parish priest,10,8 December 2016,"The movie was Nominated for five Oscars: Best Actress (Meryl Streep), Best Actor Supporting Actor, (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Best Supporting Actress (Amy Adams), Best Supporting Actress (Viola Davis), and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay (John Patrick Shanley).The movie captures your attention almost from the very beginning. My wife and I went to a local jam-packed Cineplex to see this the day after Christmas. It was so engrossing that the entire audience was totally quiet throughout the movie. In fact, at times, I almost forgot the audience was there--they were all as engrossed as we were.The plot takes place in a Catholic Church and school in the Bronx in 1964, shortly after John Kennedy was assassinated. There is a strong suspicion that the new priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), is abusing a black alter boy, Donald Miller—though the words are never used —as they would NOT have been then. The suspicion begins with the school's Principal, a very tough task master, Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep). She advises her fellow nuns to be on the lookout for anything that may seem strangeor wrong in the parish. When a young nun, Sister James (Amy Adams), thinks she sees evidence of an inappropriate protective nature that Father Flynn has towards Donald—together with smelling alcohol on the boy's breath--Sister James reports it to Sister Aloysius. This sets in motion a powerfully dramatic battle of wills between Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn. The audience can hardly help from getting involved, being drawn into the situation and feeling strongly for one side or the other...Another idea that one thinks about upon leaving the theater--in silent awe from the movie--is that back at that time, priests had great power over the nuns—as well as the parishioners: the 'good ol' boys network.'",Doubt
121,rollernerd,What would you do?,9,29 September 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is Doubt (2008), where the queen herself Meryl Streep, plays a harsh iron gloved stuck in her old ways yet protective principal at a Catholic School. Her ways are challenged by the charismatic priest played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman who is popular among the children. Streep's character soon suspects the relationship between the priest and a young boy which soon locks into a battle of wits and a demonstration of power struggle.So here is the question: both a nun and the principal have suspicions that the priest is a danger to the children with no hard evidence - what is the right step to take? To not follow a case without positive evidence? Or to follow the case and forcefully find out the truth? Maybe he was innocent and he has a right to privacy and is a good man empathizing with the youth and is open to modern times. Or maybe he is who Streep's character believes him to be.This movie blew me away. Great acting, great script and great story. There is more about this film that your usual story around unearthing the truth, so much more. The main conflict comes down to each individual's perspective around their beliefs and values of the world and their ability to accept the ambiguity of day to day living. There's a lot about the world we will never know and much about our futures we'll never be able to control. The movie questions us to either ignore or anticipate the worst and therefore being prepared when it comes; or believing in the best and running the risk of being disappointed when it fails to arise? And the fact that the movie just poses this question is genius. Both Streep and Hoffman are amazing and it was like watching two professional boxing players at their best, blow for blow which leads to the final and explosive confrontation. Streep's character is the most fascinating, her accent is on point along what you expect of a harsh principal but her belief in demanding justice within a male-dominated world that's willing to look the other way - masterful. Then there is child's mother played by Viola Davis, who is in it for like five or so minutes, decimates the audience with some shocking conclusions of her own which questions the racial and gender inequality into harsh perspective, which can be related to today's modern world.

I really enjoyed this film for it's effective portrayal of a lone woman fighting the inherent misogyny within institutional catholicism. Undoubtedly, Sister Aloysious became a nun for deeply spiritual and humanitarian reasons. Inevitably, from what she observes, she has to doubt some of the beliefs she otherwise holds very dear. It is a sad situation for her but she carries on doing the best that she can for all of her charges. Streep plays her role superbly.

124,galileo3,Doubt is a masterpiece and the best film of the year,9,9 February 2009,"Doubt (2008) Number 1 - 2008John Patrick Shanley adapts his Pulitzer Award winning play to the big screen with success, selecting a fine cast, that enable the film to become the magnificent motion picture that it is. This is one of the very best pictures of the year and I am hugely disappointed that the Academy has not nominated this powerful, morally inquisitive film for Best Picture. The reasons lie in the fact that the film is 'small' and does not have the material or vast scope of other Best Picture nominees to catapult it into that category, although it deservedly should be there.The film's story is simple, but its message unyielding and eternally applicable - Doubt - and the problems that can result from uncertainty. The film takes place in Saint Nicholas High School in the Bronx in 1964. It centres around the possible misconduct and sexual improprieties of Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) towards the only African-American student in the school, Donald Miller. Father Flynn is shown in the film to show an apparent liking to the unfortunate boy, who had no friends or support in an era where schools in America very much had de facto segregation. Sister James (Amy Adams), a young and naive teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller. One day during Sister James' class, she receives a call in her class asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance, she notices Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. On guard for unusual behavior, Sister James reveals her suspicions to Sister Aloysius, the school's strict, old-fashioned head mistress (Meryl Streep).Aloysius becomes convinced that Miller was abused by Father Flynn and set upon destroying Flynn for his unforgivable sins. The film revolves around this issue.Many will not see a point to Doubt and consider it a superbly acted film with little substance. However, this film has much more than might appear. It is a parable about life, mistakes, stubbornness and a nod to the rapidly changing nature of the church during the 1960s. This is a great film, an incredible picture that deserves more recognition than it has gained.Masterpiece. Full stop.10/10",Doubt
125,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"Heavy, thought provoking, yet ultimately unsatisfying and almost boring despite the best acting of the year.",7,24 December 2008,"I had my doubts about this film, no pun intended. The film is pretty much nothing but dialog and based on a play (which outside of a select few, often fails), so my expectations were lowered, but one look at the superb cast makes one's expectations rise...so I didn't, and still don't know, what to make of the film.The acting is nothing short of tremendous - as expected - however, this does not make a film great...It makes a film good. Which is what I've decided ""Doubt"" is. It has a story that, despite being set in the 1960's, feels extremely relevant and will test the nerve of a viewer. ""Doubt"" is not one for the viewer who doesn't like to think in the theater - it is certainly the thinking man's drama - not thriller.The film is, as I've already said, almost entirely dialog. For this to work, a director must be given a good script, and since said director not only wrote the screenplay, but also the play itself, he's the perfect man for the job. The dialog is quick, fast, and electrifying. John Shanley's work has transferred beautifully in this sense - in others, not so much. I never got to see the stage play, but I can certainly see the theatricality of the play running through the veins of the film. The sets are simple, yet elegant, and all of our main characters besides Father Flynn wear the same costume throughout the film, a practice often seen in a play. The best thing that's happened in the transition is the beautiful cinematography from Roger Deakins.Another thing I noticed was that each performance looked more like a stage performance than a film performance, though this is not necessarily a bad thing. All of our performers are loud, use projection, and use their voices over their faces to express emotion - all of these are qualities of great stage actors. The only exception to this 'rule' would be Viola Davis's character who actually does the reverse - using the face over the voice.""Doubt"" is a film that requires thought and will test the morals and views of each viewer who comes across it. It certainly does the job in this department. You'll find a sort of 'inner-conflict' within yourself during the film, asking yourself ""which character do I believe?"" and ""which character do I support"". Surprisingly, because of the tremendous characters and performances, the answer to both of those questions may not be the same.Let's start off with the always towering and intimidating Meryl Streep, who maybe brought a bit too much theatricality to her performance. Don't get me wrong, Streep's show is dynamite and spectacular. There's no one in the business that can deliver a tough tongue lashing like her. I just found that her character seemed too larger than life within the setting of a film and really should've been taken down a notch or two by the director.Philip Seymour Hoffman is on some kind of streak of a lifetime recently, isn't he? Hoffman has a pair of Oscar nominations within the last few years, and it'll be a crying shame if he doesn't get a third one for his wonderful portrayal of Father Flynn. He is likely the character that the audience will identify with, because of the warmth of his performance. This is something Hoffman and Shanley know, and they use it to their advantage for great dramatic affect in the climactic showdown between Hoffman and Streep.On that note, I must say that the aforementioned scene is probably the most well-acted scene of 2008. I was on the edge of my seat, and in awe of two of acting's greatest titans going at each other like that.Though her profile may not be as high, the delightful Amy Adams's talent pool is just as deep as her co-stars. I mentioned that each viewer will likely side with one of the 3 main characters, and I sided with Adams's Sister James. Her instant likability sets the stage for some great moments between her and her more famous co-stars. Ms. Adams has continued to impress me with every film role she's had for the past 3 or 4 years, and I would like to see a second Oscar nomination for her work in this film.Viola Davis has, perhaps, received the most praise for her brief turn as the mother of the child at the center of the film's controversial subject matter, while I think the praise she has received is due (she's nothing short of heartbreaking), she simply does not have the screen time to affect the viewer in the way that Hoffman and Adams do. Her turn is simply stunning, yet too brief to leave too much of a lasting impression.""Doubt"" is a film that is extremely hard to discuss, and I'm surprised I've gotten this far into it. It's the thinking man's drama, and is certainly not for the faint of heart. Meryl Streep is larger than life, while Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams further pad their resumes with wonderful performances for their futures, however it doesn't mean the film is exactly perfect. The transition from stage to screen is difficult, strenuous, and borderline boring if you can't get into it within the first 30 minutes. The ending, that leaves the viewer wanting MUCH more, made me feel a bit unsatisfied.",Doubt
126,rlaine,Writer/director had his own doubts?,6,18 January 2010,"I went to this movie only knowing it would have performances worthy of four Oscar nominations, not really knowing anything of the story itself, which I find the best way of viewing most movies.There certainly was potential and the performances were enjoyable – tho maybe not exceptional. Like it's been said, Amy Adams' character was somewhat flat compared the rest of the cast. Hoffman pulled off as much as I believe was possible with the script given and Streep was a pleasure to watch, until maybe the very ending.The story was intriguing until around the half way thru, when they kind of let the monster out of the closet. Like horror movies are good only until they show the beast, Doubt also was only good until Streep's character let out her full thoughts to the boys mother. I'm not 100 % sure, but I believe up until this point, everything was only hinted, not exactly spoken out.I figure it would've been so much better, if the audience would have had to make up their own mind of both the accusations and doubts. After all, the audience knew just as much as the characters, who also had to create their accusations and doubts over a couple of dialogues and a few hints. A lot of stuff seemed underlined, mostly as spoken by Adams' character, who I felt at times played the one ""who explains everything to the audience"".The ""sub plots"" of the pupils seemed somewhat irrelevant and some symbolism (the light bulb, ballpoint pen, sugar?) as well as some camera trickery (tilted view on certain scenes) were confusing at most. I haven't seen the stage play, but I assume the movie would've worked better more bare boned, with only the four characters. They should've trusted the actors, actresses and the audience more.Now the movie fell a bit flat both as a drama and a mystery.",Doubt
127,talisencrw,One of America's great 21st-century films!,9,22 September 2016,"Knee-deep in the throes of my first love, I was quite surprised to hear that my lady's favourite movie was 'Joe Versus the Volcano'. (I still haven't seen the film). It dawned on me, when I wanted to check out an American film which, to my knowledge, had a plethora of fine acting, that this was written and directed by the same guy who made that film much earlier. Being raised Christian and hearing in the press over the past few years about misdeeds, especially involving leaders of the Catholic church (represented in films as diverse as 'The Boys of St. Vincent' (John N. Smith, 1992) and 'In Bruges' (Martin McDonagh, 2008), I was especially intrigued by this, his work of more recent vintage.The ambiguity at the core of the film (and hence the 'doubt') really acts in the movie's favour. The script and direction are both tense and flawless, and the beautiful New York locations chosen to illustrate The Bronx in 1964 help air the play out, and give it more cinematic scope. It features some of the finest work I have seen from Philip Seymour Hoffman (though my favourites will always be 'Happiness' and 'The Master'), Meryl Streep (my most-esteemed works of hers are 'The Deer Hunter' and 'The Devil Wears Prada') and Amy Adams (this is her finest performance IMHO) as well as a breakthrough role for Viola Davis, who steals every scene she's in. This easily holds up well even with Shanley's Oscar-winning screenplay for 'Moonstruck', and, though dark and depressing, is thoroughly recommended for those who can stomach its subject matter, and peer into that abyss without flinching, as these fine exemplars of 21st-century American cinema so easily do here.That it didn't win any of its five Oscar nominations is almost as ghastly, to the cinephile, as the misdeeds insinuated here are to the community at large.

128,fung0,More like Vagueness than Doubt,6,14 May 2009,"Doubt is almost a great film, but it falls short on logic. The many 10/10 ratings seem to refer more to what the film *should* have been, than to what it turned out to be.For me, the main problem is the trick that Meryl Streep's nun plays on Hoffman's priest - lying about calling a nun in his old parish. This seems to reveal with far too much certainty that the man is indeed guilty - of something. If he wasn't expelled from previous positions, why does he not question the (supposed) phone call more strongly? If we are to believe that the priest resigns simply because he feels unable to fight the slander, then we should hear him say so. Instead, we see only that he's running away; apparently, the nun's tactic has worked.As a result, the nun ends up looking far too 'right,' and the ending sounding far too glib. There's no other explanation offered, no discussion of ramifications or possibilities. Could the priest's obvious good works excuse some wrongdoing? The question is not asked, nor answered. On the other hand, is the nun right to be malicious and inflexible, because in the end she accomplishes the correct result? Apparently she is, since any ill effects - especially on the naive younger nun - are not really delved into. (They're suggested in one scene, then abandoned. If there have been no ill effects, then clearly the older nun was right.)So far, the film's point of view is clear as mud. (In fact, various reviewers here have come to entirely different conclusions. That's not Doubt; that's just vague.)On top of all this there's the historical perspective. I was actually IN Catholic schools at about this time, and I happen to know the real guilty party, beyond any Doubt: it was the Church as an institution. The film seems prepared to tackle this issue, but again fails to carry through. We have the older nun, representing the stiff, traditional past. Contrasted with the priest, who reflects the much-needed modernization brought in by Pope John XXIII. Yet it's the priest who ends up in the wrong. What are we to make of this?And what about Meryl Streep's character - who quite accurately represents generations of venomous, domineering nuns who terrorized small children - a legacy of institutionalized bullying that did easily as much harm overall as any priestly molestations. Do we hate her for the harm she does? Well, it's not really shown. She's right every time she deals with a child, and none show any obvious ill effects of her domination. (Though I would suggest that in fact the film's characterizations are accurate; Catholic schools tended to either crush children's will, or turn them into obnoxious rebels. Both outcomes are represented in the film, but the point of what we're seeing is not raised.)With all this in mind, Streep's final cry of ""Oh, I'm so wracked with doubt!"" sounds very hollow indeed. What is she so doubtful about?? She has absolute certainty that the priest was guilty. Is she just agonizing over the methods she used to defeat him? Could it be that the *real* doubt in this movie is merely whether or not the ends justify the means?? If so, how disappointing, when so many other questions have been raised! And how uninteresting, given that no real ill effects of her tactics are shown.Which brings us to the central dramatic failing of the film. The real pivotal character of this story is clearly that of the younger, naive nun. She is the only character that undergoes a major transformation, and hence begs to be spotlighted. Yet we are left entirely unclear as to how the events of the film have affected her. Has she been poisoned by the elder nun's harsh attitudes? Or has she absorbed the love and humor of the (possibly flawed) priest? Or, ultimately, can she find a middle course, that would show a way forward for the Church: due caution, tempered with a love that puts the children's welfare first? Unfortunately, the film's ending veers away from this, THE key question, and focuses on Streep's deeply uninteresting ""Doubt.""It seems like Shanley set out to create one of those knife's-edge dramas, where difficult questions are raised but not given absolute answers. But at some point he slipped off, ending up not with ambivalence and ""Doubt,"" but with logic that's just muddled. Or maybe the gaps were filled by material that ended up on the cutting room floor. I had the strong feeling the film wanted to be about fifteen minutes longer. A bit more exposition might have at least told us what we were supposed to be in Doubt *about.*On the positive side, I'd say that the film looks terrific, and the (three!) main performances are brilliant - even though constrained by by Shanley's confused script.",Doubt
129,dakjets,Just great - I really love this film,9,22 March 2019,"Meryl Streep. Philip Seymour Hoffman. Viola Davis. Yes, the casting is strong. Still, Doubt has not become either Streep's or Hoffman's best and most famous films. Far from it. In my opinion, it has not received the recognition it deserves. I think this is a great movie, very strong story and not least with this A-team that portrays a nun and a priest who really measures forces against each other. In a story of yes, doubt, but also rumors, assumptions, power and roles. The film takes place at a Catholic primary school, where the nun is the principal, and the priest her superior. The film does not have many effects, and most scenes take place at school. Still, it do not a theater touch, but has progress and ability to play the doubt over us who are watching. We also take the position of what is unfolding, and this is engaging. This is a top drama, of the best quality in terms of both the actors (including Viola Davis) and the somewhat appalling act. For movie lovers!",Doubt
130,Michael Fargo,"It's not just the wind the blows in John Patrick Shanley's ""Doubt""",6,14 December 2008,"Adapting his own award winning Broadway play into a filmand then making the poor choice of directing it himselfthere's no one else to point fingers at what makes it to the screen here. Stage plays are notoriously difficult to adapt to the screen. This probably stood a pretty good chance of being interesting had Shanley turned the project over to someone who had a little more perspectiveand a lot more skill. A director, say, who didn't resort to the use of weather phenomenon to convey emotion: wind, rain, icemore wind.I was personally angered by what I'm guessing was the point Shanley was going for here. The abuse by priests on young members of their communities isn't a subject that really calls for a treatise on doubt. The Pope, for God's sake, apologized to his fold for these abuses. And the Catholic Church doesn't have a record of hastily apologizing for its errors: Took a few centuries to get around to excusing themselves for the Inquisition, just about as much time for persecution of members of the Jewish faith. But here, it was wham-bam-we're-sorrythrowing in large sums of money to settle legal claims.So mounting a project called ""Doubt"" on this particular subject matter takes a delicate hand. Sister Aloysius Beauvier doesn't really tread lightly with either hand nor fist nor, as Shanley lays it out, someone slow to judge.By the end, I was so furious that we're invited to condemn her for what appears to be a pretty damning set of circumstances against the new priest in her parish. If say, the character of Sister James (Amy Adams hitting the wall on her range as an actress here) were the one quick to suspect, and Sister Beauvierrepresenting the old order of the Church which conspired to keep the lid on the abuses of priestshad been the doubter, that at least would have mirrored history.Instead we get one of the campiest characterizations of a head-thumping/ruler-wielding (in one instance she carries a prop thatno kiddinglooks like a Devil's pitchfork) this side of ""Saturday Night Live."" Streep is really cast adrift by the director here. She certainly doesn't need to prove anything as an actress, but it's clear that she needs an experienced director.Philip Seymour Hoffman does better, but he's also playing a character who is meant to ""charm"" everyone. And that he does. But Shanley just sets up some innuendo's and a few facts that together actually do raise doubt not only for Sister Beauvier but also the audience. We do see the reason for a meeting between the three principal characters to iron out the misunderstandings/accusations. It's the best part of the movie, but from that well-played scene we move to one of the most objectionable scenes I've seen in a major motion picture.Sister Beauvier approaches the allegedly abused boy's mother to sound out her feelings on things, and the words the mother is given to play raise such a repulsive point of view--right out of the pages of a child abuser's handbook--that Sister Beauvier's response (which is ""Excuse me"") made me laugh out loud. (The actress who plays the mother, Viola Davis, earns all the praise she's getting as an actress; I just find what she says to be so mindbogglingly stupid that I'm puzzled there aren't pickets by the mother's of abused children in front of theaters.) And then there's the final line delivered by Streep.There really aren't ""false accusations"" in this drama. It felt like Shanley wanted to present the accusations of abuse by priests over the last decade as something similar to the Salem Witch trials, where innocent people were accused for all sorts of reasons. Sister Beauvier who may be narrow-minded and feeling threatened by the changes in society around has valid ground for asking the questions she does. The answers Father Flynn gives raise the ante for both the Sister and for the audience. And when the whole thing is over (we aren't given proof for either side) the playwright/screenwriter has the nerve to suggest she should have never opened her mouth.Given what the child's mother has to say, given what Father Flynn chooses, given the history of this issue within the Church, it's morally reprehensible to suggest Sister Beauvier should have never started down the road she chooses. From where I sat, she did the right thing. Just because you're an unpleasant nag doesn't exempt you from protecting children. And the damage this type of material does to the cause of protecting children from abuse is considerable.",Doubt
131,GirishGowda,How Does One Get Rid Of Their Doubts?,9,6 July 2010,"One of the most well-acted and engaging films, this is another good piece of work from the year of 2008 where we had so many wonderful movies. There are three powerful actors; Streep, Hoffman and Amy Adams in the leading roles and I just got a chance to see it last night. Streep and Adams are my favourite actors and I knew this movie had to be something special. I loved their 'Julie & Julia', and considering the fact that in this movie they actually get screen time together, I was excited. Both of them pull in their best performances and Hoffman is also excellent in his portrayal of the Father. Before watching the movie, I had a notion that this movie would tackle the subject of God and our society's fading beliefs in Him. But it had nothing to do with it and I was actually quite glad, I have seen many a movie which have a religious theme, especially Bollywood films. Set in 1964, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep) is the strict vice- principal of St. Nicholas School and she discusses about the recent sermon of Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) where he tackles the subject of 'doubt'. She is concerned about Father Flynn's attachment to Donald Miller, the first black student in the school and wants the sweet innocent Sister James (Amy Adams) to be on the lookout for any odd behaviour in Donald Miller. Sister James notices that Donald has alcohol breath after his talk with Father Flynn alone in the rectory during class hours. After this disturbing news, Father Flynn is confronted by Sister Aloysius where he tells her to leave the matter alone, but when she persists, he reveals that Donald Miller drank the altar wine and he had nothing to do with it. When asked why he didn't report it, he tells he was just protecting the boy. He manages to convince Sister James and she puts her doubts to rest after this revelation, but Sister Aloysius seems to be convinced that Father Flynn is hiding something. In all outward appearances Father Flynn is a caring and loving man, but Sister Aloysius' belief that he has behaved in an inappropriate way with Donald is unshakeable. Did he or didn't he commit the crime?The subject of morality and the power of our conscience is tackled in this controversial movie. It remains as appropriate today, if not more in its theme. The direction and screenplay is wonderful, there isn't one boring moment and its credits go to the three leading actors. This is an actor's movie, make no mistake about it. The conversation of Sister Aloysius with Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis) is very powerful as it brings out all the fears of the woman who is living in a world which isn't exactly kind to her or her family because of the colour of her skin. Meryl Streep brings out all of Sister Aloysius' convictions and her conflicting thoughts about the judgement she has to receive after she dies; she was perfect. Amy Adams has blossomed into such a wonderful actress. Amy Adams' character lives in a world where nothing could be bad and she was perfect for the role of the naive girl. Even I had my doubts over Sister Aloysius' determination to bring down Father Flynn, because Hoffman gave such a fabulous performance as a sweet, loving man who just treats everyone in an equal manner. The ending kinda bummed me out, but is this a true story? Because they have dedicated it to a real Sister James. Anyway this is a very good movie, watch it if you can. 9/10",Doubt
132,Jared_Andrews,Nothing is as Certain as You'd like it to be,7,22 July 2020,"When a friendly priest appears to become a little too friendly with a young altar boy, he must be guilty of something. Or does he?A couple of nuns, one the principal of the Catholic grade school and the other a teacher, suspect the priest of inappropriate behavior after he called a boy into a private meeting for no reason in particular. The priest is kind, especially to the boy. The priest is so caring that the boy would even say he's fond of the priest. After all, the boy is the lone Black student, he's new to the school, and this story takes place in the 1960s. He has trouble fitting in, so he's grateful to have anyone he can consider a friend.So, what's the truth? With a title like ""Doubt"" you would be right to suspect that the facts might remain uncertain. The principal, Sister Aloysius, maintains a steadfast resolve of the priest's guilt. She seems so certain about everything - her disdain for the modern world, including all of its most gruesome amoralities, like Frosty the Snowman and ballpoint pens.Of course she resents the priest for his forward-thinking ways and willingness to adapt to the changing times. He represents a threat to her pious way of life. To her, things should stay as they have been, now and in perpetuity. Anything else is blasphemy.In the movie's most powerful scene, Sister Aloysius tells the boy's mother about her suspicions about the priest. The mother's reaction and reveal catch her off guard. Suddenly the situation isn't so simple.The movie brilliantly dangles hints but is careful not to reveal too much until the very end. Even then, you may not find the clarity you hoped for. Watch ""Doubt"" if you want to think, but happy times should be sought elsewhere.",Doubt
133,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Doubt Can Kill You!!,7,1 September 2013,"Everyone doubts others actions, methods or intentions. It's a natural human tendency. The movie uses the same plot of a strict principal doubting one priest's relation with a troubled kid in the school. But the things are not always the way they look like at first glance. As the plot uncovers it raises the doubts not only about actions but even about our beliefs of right and wrong. The movie carries a single tone throughout. Acting is most strong part of this drama. Meryl Streep excels as usual while Hoffman and Adams provide the committed support. The movie does not answers all your questions and leaves you puzzled or better to say in a state of doubt.",Doubt

Meryl Streep is once again an acting force in her role, too bad I didn't care more for her as a character, nor have any empathy for what she tosses to Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams-thank you JUNE BUG!-is such a strong contrast to Streep's nun.

Acting is great; notably streep and seymour's intense spar moment and viola davis's. They successfully conveyed and surprise you with many complicated issues worth thinking about, in terms of religion, sex, race, humanity, and the judgement of right from wrong. Although the main question is 'Did the priest really committed it or its just the obsession of one nun in great doubt?' but i see this question being intertwined with so many more possibilities along with many sub-questions, all purposely unanswered. In fact i tink the answer is neither, I tink there was some confusion going on....the nun may be right that he did do something, but then she maybe also wrong that he did not commit to any wrongdoings as what she had 'expected'. Would like to see the play if i am given the chance. Although it did not win in the golden globes, it definitely will give a hell lot of homework to any student writing a piece of report on it.",Doubt
136,ltlacey,A Sister at a Catholic school has suspicions regarding the priest and one of the students.,9,11 April 2009,"Set aside the ""goofs"" that whoever was in charge of continuity missed (for a film of this caliber whoever was in charge should not be allowed to do this job anymore), the superb acting will win you over and you won't notice any of them. Streep, as usual (even in fluff movies), is spot on in her role as Sister Aloysius, who suspects that Father Flynn, played by Hoffman (man, can this man act) is up to ""no good"" with one of the students. Every scene in which the two of them are together is powerful. Davis, as the mother of the boy who in involved in this ""scandal,"" is perfect as usual, and if her scene with Streep, when she is talking about how her son just needs to make it to June, does not move you, then, well, nothing I can say about that. Hate to use the word twice, but this single scene is the most powerful in the movie. She knows her son is a certain way, and that possibly something is amiss at his school, but what can she do? The real surprise, though, was Adams, as Sister James. I was getting weary of all her roles as some ditzy or silly character, especially lately, but this movie proved that Adams has the mettle to go head-to-head with some heavy hitters (Streep, Hoffman, and Davis). She starts out a little immature and juvenile, but so do all new teachers. Then reality kicks in. I look forward to seeing Adams mature, along with her roles. And I so want to see Streep and Hoffman do something else together as well. If you are looking for a movie with physical action, you'll not find it here. This movie is pure theater, put to screen, and done so quite well.",Doubt

138,stevepat99,Better title: DoubtLESS,5,10 January 2009,"Time for me to swim a bit upstream on this one. First off, having viewed the trailer numerous times I was set-up for an awesome conflict of ultra talented dueling movie star icons. The film delivers grade A+ on that score so hand out those well deserved acting awards! Amy Adams however is the exception.Leaving the theater I felt cheated. First, nonsensical casting of Amy Adams playing a near airhead version of miss Sister goody two shoes. Amy hits her crescendo, dramatic peak when, for the first time in her life, she seriously chastises a student. Sister Aloysius would have chewed her up and spit her out long ago. Next, I knew there was trouble in paradise when ball point pens took center stage. Why doubtLESS? Because Sister Aloysius, possibly due to a deep seated pre-disposition against men, has it in for Father Flynn from day one. Her doubtless days begin even before the alleged event occurs. She is driven. She is sister terminator, sister ever ready bunny, relentless in her pursuit of her oft stated 'certainty' of Flynn's guilt. So certain she does not hesitate for a nano second in confronting him face to face with her accusations. So doubtless that she freely, gleefully admits the lack of any hard evidence is irrelevant because she is doubtless in her certainty of his guilt. She, like Carnack the Great, KNOWS ALL.The ultra level of her doubtless certainly is laid bare time and again. No need for her to involve higher ups, no need for hard evidence, no need to question the 'victim' and/or major witness. She is not a bad cop she is sister cop/judge and jury. Whatever her private demons they instill and fuel her doubtless fervor.Where's the beef? Nada, none, nil. Guilty or innocent...who knows? As sister Aloysius admits....there is NO evidence....ONLY her own inner voice declaring him guilty. By playing out her sister terminator card Sister Aloysius easily convinces Flynn to take the only available path consistent with his understandable desire for self preservation. It also permits Flynn to protect the student from certain damage should the student's 'nature' be publicly aired and revealed.Consequences: Aside from lack of any evidence and a the awesome verbal duels the film offers NONE. There are no suicides, no damage to Flynn's career, no body counts and no severe except perhaps to Aloysius as she fights those inner demons. Just the opposite as Aloysius notes that Flynn has been promoted and is now in charge of an entire school. There is no indication that the 'doubt'Aloysius eventually professes has anything do with her perceived,irrational certainty of Flynn's guilt. More likely she doubts her actions as they conflict with her church, vows, dormant morality code etc.And what about sister's Aloysius 'phone call' to a nun at Flynn's last assignment. Does not Flynn's reacton prove his guilt? Of course not. Sister Terminator admits to Flynn she is has violated church rules and will do what ever it takes, LEGIT OR NOT, to nail him. In the end Flynn reacts to sister Terminator rather than the alleged gossip between Aloysius and a nun at his last assignment. In fact Flynn pleads for Aloysius to call the Monsignor at his last Parrish all to no avail. After all the 'doubLESS' Sister Aloysius determined early that the only reason to investigate the matter would be to prove Flynn's INNOCENCE. And that was never on her agenda.One could apply the Seinfeld theory of 'all about nothing.' Start with a teacher calling a student out of class for a discussion. From that 'nothing' (we never learn it is anything more) we add an inner demon fueled terminator nun, a few hot chats between she and Flynn and he Flynn announcing (in Arnold's best Terminator twang) ...OK you winnnnn...ADIOUS AND I WON'T BE BAAACK!",Doubt
139,arthera09,sigh,7,4 July 2009,"I was debating on whether I was going to give this a 6, but that would not be fair because I already had such a strong opinion of what happened before I even watched the movie because I already saw the play. This will probably be my most pretentious review and probably one of my most critical reviews making me seem like a stuck up know it all. I will say that I saw the play performed by a small private college and was pleased by the staging. I enjoyed the minimalistic set design and the lack of characters. By never meeting so many characters in the play the concept of doubt was much more tangible and most of the nuances of the play were lost by seeing the characters and seeing things that only happened off stage. The movie gave a much more complete feeling of the surroundings, but I do not think that played that much into the theme of the movie. I get how it is not important that the audience is left to make their own decisions about the characters, but I feel as if the director made it too direct. I like how the play/movie is open for debate and that everyone can come away with a different interpretation. I feel as if the play left much more open, but that is once again that is just the nature of the play. There were very few things that I think the movie improved upon that even the amateurish production (that was still excellent in my mind) that I saw. So here is my major criticism: I think Shanley stopped this from being a best picture contender and that he is a sloppy director at best. First of all the cast was fantastic and the acting really good. The one criticism I have for the cast actually goes to the women that won the academy Award and that is that Streep's accent came and went. In the longer more emotional speeches she lost the accent and I feel as if people miss that because of the power of her acting. I thought Amy Adams did a much better job keeping the character through out the entire movie. I do not disagree with the award, but things like that bother me. Surprising enough the weakest member of the cast was Hoffman and I do not blame him at all. I think that the director made a bad decision by having Hoffman play the sermons more subdue. I would have loved to see them played with much more passion than he did. Especially the first one. I think we got enough of the compassionate side of his character through other moments. I am not sure how this was nominated for best Adapted screen play having seen both. I would have loved to have seen some of the fire that he portrayed in his final scene with Streep in his sermons. Also there was the one shot when the camera was crooked that looked ridiculous and the shot could have been done better. I would have like to have seen the camera steady itself as Streep composed herself instead of just being slanted the entire time. I think the cast saved this and the Shanley did keep the open ended nature of the play in the movie. So the last thing and this was hotly debated with a friend of mine before I saw the movie and after I saw the play. The last line of the movie. I would say that it did not work mainly because Streep played the character too strong. I think the reason it worked in the play that I saw was because the audience felt the doubt that the character Streep played (I am not going to try to spell her name) throughout the play instead of it just being one huge contradicting moment at the end of the movie. This is probably my longest review ever and I will stop, but there was a lot wrong with this movie and it could have been better and the cast saved it. I really enjoyed the special feature about the Sisters of Charity. It also seemed pretty apparent pretty quickly in the special features that the actors got the movie better than the director and the one guy interviewing them for EW (which is staring to anger me as a movie publication). That is all. Do not watch this movie if you have seen the play. You will probably enjoy if you have never seen the play, but will probably still find problems with it.",Doubt

142,joestank15,Subtle and nuanced drama,9,25 December 2008,"Doubt - In this fascinating character drama, Sister Alyosius Beauvier (Meryl Streep) squares off against priest Brendan Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) in her quest for the truth concerning his questionable relationship with a black boy at their parish. Set in 1964, this film deals with themes of race, power, certainty and (obviously) doubt. There is also thought to be given to our preference of tone over message in most aspects of society. Too often is the right answer lost in the fray due to our desires to have everything sugar-coated for us. The acting is as good as you could imagine with two acting superstars of the movie world as the leads. Meryl Streep continually proves her mettle as one of the finest actresses on the planet with a deeply nuanced character that reminded me, at her nastiest, of my harshest teachers. Yet beneath this is a person who cares deeply about truth and justice. She is cruel because she is not a sugar salesman. Hoffman's character Flynn is sensitive and easily likable. He is kind and understanding and viewers may find themselves switching viewpoints and often giving in to doubt. As Flynn mentions, certainty and doubt are themselves emotions and subject to the same scrutiny you would any flimsy feelings. Mention also goes out to Amy Adams' sweet and genuine performance as Sister James, our audience companion and the soul that Flynn and Alyosius battle over. The direction is content to let the powerful leads do their thing, though the use of the back and forth camera gets a little tiresome as the most interesting thing for me is the reaction shots of the characters to each other. The storm during the argument is, admittedly, a bit of a tiresome device at this point. Still, overall, no complaints about direction.Something I absolutely loved was the subtle tension in the preliminary confrontation scene. It's actually far more effective and gripping than the shouting matches the trailers have showcased. Shouting matches are very showy but not as interesting as what goes unsaid whilst the mind makes calculations. In fact I missed a few small events due to their subtlety and almost thrown in quality. Nothing is telegraphed or intoned. Clearly John Patrick Shanley (Director, writer, and original playwright) is quite a clairvoyant in picking up energies from people, because the tension is sometimes electrifying here. No doubt about it. Compelling to the end, Doubt, gets an A-",Doubt

Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis do extraordinary and career defining work in this. they all got Oscar nominations but didn't win unfortunately. its actually very hard to determine who my favourite actor was in the film. the directing and screenplay is simply amazing by John Patrick Shanley. i've not heard of him before but hoping he makes other flawless masterpieces like this. i think he should of won some Oscars for this film. i really don't know how Slumdog Millionaire got the better of this, The wrestler and The curious Case Of Benjamin Buttons. don't get me wrong because Slumdog is brilliant but them other films surpass it i think.its a truly powerful and stunning story. the story tackles with a very controversial concept, child abuse.

144,maximovlE,disapointment,1,16 March 2021,"By the looks of other reviews, mine will probably be hugely unpopular, although it remains valid.As I regularly do, I started watching the movie with no preconceptions. I had no knowledge of the film at all. For me it started well, a great cast, well directed, and as the story progressed there was some fantastic acting. And then nothing.The ending is abrupt. even the final line tells us that nothing was certain. There could be a million different reasons as to why events unfolded as they did and there is no certainty at all that any wrongdoings were carried out.So, it's not a story at all as such, but a lesson in the power of language? I'm sorry, but for me this isn't entertainment. I was entertained for a while, but that entertainment was reduced to frustration when I discover that the build up leads to nothing. Are we required to decide for ourselves what really happened? Does what really happened actually bear any relevance at all?Maybe I missed the point. However, I want to indulge in a story, I want to be entertained, I want the movie to do the talking. I don't want to be responsible for filling in the blanks. So for me, there is nothing here but disappointment.",Doubt
145,Davalon-Davalon,Riveting,9,2 February 2009,"I can see there are scads of wordy reviews on this film. I certainly understand that; I was really taken aback by it. But in brief: Meryl Streep is America's finest actress. Some critics have called her over-the-top in this role. I thought she was brilliant and spot on, as I did with Amy Adams, Viola Davis and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Should some important questions have been answered in this film? Should certain moments been explained more clearly? Actually... no. This film sucks you in and you must make your own conclusions about what may have happened at a small Catholic school in 1964. But while you are drawing your own conclusions, you should be swept away by the enormous acting gifts of all the principals. I cannot say one was better than the other, although I can say Viola Davis was fearless in her two brief scenes and that the woman is an amazing actress -- probably more so as a supporting actress because she is so intense that to watch her carry an entire film may be too much. At any rate... I came to the film knowing nothing, and I was simply overwhelmed by the talent, the tension, the intensity. I would say this was an extremely satisfying movie-going experience.",Doubt
146,Sankari_Suomi,Streepy... and not in a good way,8,1 April 2014,"I am not a fan of Mery Streep and she is particularly Streepy in this claustrophobic tale of repressed 1960s American Catholicism, but she does it quite well so fair play to her for that.Here Streep plays an obsessive, guilt-ridden nun (or, to put it another way, she plays herself).Philip 'Seymour' Hoffman is superb as the sensitive, homosexual priest who infuriates Streep by not being interested in gay altar boys. Not even Ben Affleck could have done better.Amy Adams gives a fine performance as the timid, sexually frustrated nun disturbed by her latent lesbianism (practically the entire film is about sex, it's quite disgusting).Viola Davis is the black working class mother who wants Hoffman to sodomise her son for a few months so he can get into a good high school (apparently this is how the Catholic education system works). Her climactic confrontation with Streep is deeply moving.Neville Gorman shows off his walk-on skills as an extra in the Davis/Streep scene and manages to provide essential context without upstaging the foreground. He is credited as 'Man with Beagle.' Overall an excellent movie, if somewhat disturbing in parts. I rate 'Doubt' at 26.64 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a solid 8/10 on IMDb.",Doubt
147,lucasversantvoort,"Great stuff, no doubt about it",8,6 May 2015,"Doubt, like its title suggests, is a story about doubt. Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play Doubt: A Parable, it deals with notions of guilt, innocence and what to do with one's own convictions in times of great doubt.It's 1964. In a Catholic Church in the Bronx, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) gives a sermon about doubt and how it can be a force that unifies rather than divides. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) finds it odd he would talk about that particular topic. Like the predator she is, she tells her fellow Sisters to keep their eyes open. Soon, some circumstantial evidence starts piling up, suggesting Flynn might be guilty of child molestation. Some of the 'evidence' is brought to Aloysius's attention by the sweet Sister James (Amy Adams). Aloysius's gut tells her she's right and she begins her hunt to have Flynn persecuted.The acting is great across the board. Only PSH was told the truth regarding Flynn and he adapts his performance suitably. You can simultaneously read him as the sneaky, perverted Father or the wrongly accused do-gooder. Streep's role is the meatiest and she plays it very well, though there're moments where I see her acting or moments that just feel over-the-top. Amy Adams, now an established name, was still somewhat of an up and comer. She had already been nominated for her supporting role in Junebug and now she was sparring with heavyweights like PSH and Streep. Needless to say, she pulls it off. Her role is tricky in that she represents tenderness and true innocence and in lesser hands, that can come across as schmaltzy, but Adams elegantly avoids these pitfalls. Compare that with her badassery in The Fighter and her subtly threatening performance in The Master. Speaking of breakthrough performances, Viola Davis was an instant Oscar nominee despite her only having one major scene. It helps that she's the dramatic focus of that scene, but she outperforms Streep and that should tell you something.Despite the incredibly strong narrative, I did find the ending to be rather weak. After being threatened by Aloysius, Father Flynn left the Bronx Church, having been promoted to pastor in another one. Aloysius sits alone in the garden when Sister James arrives. She confesses to Sister James that she lied to Flynn about her having visited a nun from a previous church he worked at who confirmed Flynn's guilt. According to her, his leaving confirms her suspicions. Otherwise, why didn't he fight her allegations? She then breaks down in tears, confessing to Sister James that she has doubts. Two things I don't like. First of all, the scene feels way too hammy and even Streep can't save it. It's supposed to be the cathartic moment where we finally get to see her as a Real Human Being, but it just doesn't feel right. Secondly, I don't like how the script suggests Flynn was indeed guilty while the whole point of the film was that we just don't know, that we automatically rely on our previous experiences and instincts despite the lack of evidence. Indeed, Aloysius's doubts aren't about whether or not Flynn's guilty, but whether she did the right thing in wasting all that time and energy attempting to expose him (""in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God""). His guilt was never in question for her. Also, why is Flynn's leaving an implicit admission of guilt? In my eyes, he realized Aloysius would never relent and that his reputation would be destroyed even if he decided to fight her simply due to the rumors that would inevitably spread. So he left, seeking to do good elsewhere with his reputation intact.Despite the ending, the rest of the film is very well set up. The script is wonderful (unsurprising considering the playwright adapted his own play for the big screen) and it engages you from beginning to end. It sprinkles clues regarding Flynn's guilt or innocence throughout, like the flowers in his bible, perhaps representing the amount of children he's robbed of their innocence (though the symbolism is laid on a bit thick sometimes, like the constantly blowing trees and Aloysius opening Flynn's curtains, forcing him to 'see the light and repent for his sins', as it were). Almost every line uttered by/about Flynn signifies either his innocence or guilt. It can be read both ways, like when Aloysius bluffs by telling him she went to talk with the nun. Flynn responds by saying that she should've talked with the pastor as that's the proper procedure. If you believe Flynn's guilty, then he's saying this to keep Aloysius in the dark. That particular pastor might've known and approved of Flynn's behavior so he would definitely vouch for him. If you believe Flynn's innocent, then it signifies him believing in doing the right thing and Aloysius yet again doing something improper all for the sake of persecuting him. You could easily analyze the entire film like this and it's one of the reasons I really like it. Also it perfectly fits with the whole point of the story. Like Aloysius, we fumble in the dark, trying to find out the truth about Flynn with zero evidence at our disposal. Combine this with the overall stellar acting and you've got a winner.",Doubt
148,AZINDN,Words + Actions = Shades of Gray,9,23 May 2009,"A film of subtle interpretations and definitions, the dialogues of confrontation and innuendo are alive in Doubt. Set in 1964, St. Nicolas School, a working class Bronx neighborhood Catholic school, is rife with change as new progressive priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) butts heads with the school's conservative Principal, Sr. Aloycious Beauvier (Meryl Streep). Clashing over most issues including Christmas carols vs. secular tunes (Frosty the Snowman), ball point pens vs. ink well penmanship, and rigid ideas of interaction between laity and religious personnel are simply the most overt issues identified. The young Sister James (Amy Adams) is situated between the two polar characters, a naive young woman who would like to see the world as simple and kind, but is made doubtful by the actions of Streep and Hoffman's characters in the situation of the school's only Black student, Donald Miller. Fr. Flynn encourages a less formal hand with the children, esp. the boys whom he instructs in altar boy routines, basketball, and length of finger nails. But, he also is observed by Sr. Aloyscious from her window, and Sr. James who sees Fr. Flynn place Donald Miller's undershirt in his school locker, and later, Miller's trepidation after a one-on-one meeting with the priest during school time. Little kindnesses between priest and Miller can be seen through multiple interpretations, a small toy offered can be a bribe or simply a gift, is a hug to comfort the child or an inappropriate show of affection, these gestures are observed and noted by not only the adults, but the children, who are classmates of Miller, and respond as well to what they know. Their responses to the priest clue the observer that adults in authority might be suspect. Perhaps most disconcerting is the dialogue between Sr. Aloyscious and Mrs. Miller, Donald's mother, whose school meeting is overseen by Fr. Flynn, and reveals significant information that color the observations of the senior Sister, and suspect actions of the priest toward the boy. Secondary to the issue of abuse by the priest are issues of race in the Civil Rights Movement era, patrilineal institutions like the Catholic Church, the nascent Women's Equal Rights Movement, and homosexuality as choice versus nature. All become revealed in conversations between the women. Trying to do right by all is not a simple issue of black and white but as revealed, the multiple shades of gray.The Church, the diocese, the pastors of former parishes, and the male-centric brotherhood of the priests versus the women, the convent world of the Sisters, and perhaps, a woman's intuition are contrasted harshly. In their face-to-face confrontation, Fr. Flynn and Sr. Aloyscious rend the issue of truth to the bone. However, in the final scene, the returned Sr. James is the comfort of the elder sister, whose confession of ""doubt"" can be neither the resolution nor the solution. A soul tormented, a problem covered over and ignored, and the Church inviolate, the film's ending certainly offers nothing but second thoughts to ponder and reconcile by the audience. The film is a marvelous study of words, actions, and institutions our society continues to revere and question.",Doubt
149,p_radulescu,The Movie and the Case,9,22 June 2010,"I think there are two distinct cases to discuss: the case in the movie; the case about the movie.The case in the movie: it is 1964 and in a Catholic school in Bronx a conflict erupts between the principal (Meryl Streep) and the priest (Philip Seymour Hoffman). The principal is Sister Aloysius, a nun very strict about the discipline. The priest, Father Flynn, is just the opposite, a very natural guy, open to people and to the world. The nun suspects him of pedophilia. The suspicion will never be confirmed, never thrown away. Eventually it's up to us to decide, and our role of spectators is played in the movie by Sister James (Amy Adams), a younger nun who is trying to understand what really is, oscillating between the two. By the way, genial idea of using male names for the Catholic nuns, to stress out the strictness of their rules.The case about the movie: the epoch Doubt was made and the epoch the picture takes place are very different. The sixties were the years of Vatican II; the Catholic Church was opening largely its windows. It was the conflict (often brutal) between new and tradition, between progressives and conservatives. This was then. Today the Church is facing the scandals of pedophilia (and the way they are handled by the Catholic hierarchy).So, if we take the epoch of the sixties, we take the side of Father Flynn, a man open to modernity, empathizing with the youth, with their questions and their way of seeing the world, speaking the language of his epoch, a wonderful man suspected by a retrograde nun.Only the movie is made today, for today's viewers, and we are focused on today's issues. So here is the question: once the nun had suspicions that the priest was a pedophile, what was the right way to take? To not follow a case without positive evidence? Or, by the contrary, to follow the case, to force him to come with proofs of his innocence? What was more important: his right to privacy or the safety of the boys? We can say that the movie leaves the case open. Nothing demonstrates positively that the priest is a pedophile; nothing demonstrates that he isn't.Well, the movie brings something more: what if? What if the boy is born with another orientation and the priest is just understanding and protecting him? Maybe just because the priest has the same orientation? There is a key scene in the movie, the discussion between Sister Aloysius and the boy's mother (wonderfully played by Viola Davis), leading to an unexpected outcome.And I think here is the doubt the movie is putting forward: more than the doubt of Sister James (is Father Flynn an abominable pedophile, beyond his openness?), more even than the doubt of Sister Aloysius (was she right in following a man without positive proofs?), there is the doubt of humanity. Human behavior is complex, each human case is unique and cannot be assimilated to a general pattern. Things aren't every time what they look like, we should always consider this question, what if?",Doubt
150,sonya90028,"Powerful, intelligent drama.",10,4 January 2009,"Doubt is the most powerful, well-acted drama of 2008. The story is set in 1964, at a Catholic school in the Bronx. The plot centers around the school's priest, Father Flynn. He is suspected of instigating an improper relationship, with one of the students at the school.Meryl Streep plays the stern nun and school Principal, Sister Aloysius Beauvier. Sister Aloysius is often at odds with her subordinate, Sister James. Sister James is a much younger nun, then Sister Aloysius. And Sister James doesn't agree with the harsh methods, that Sister Aloysius insists on using to deal with the students.A black student named Donald Miller is admitted to the school, and he's the only black attending. Mass integration hasn't yet been implemented at the school. So, Donald is often singled-out by the white kids, as a target for their racism. Donald seeks advice from Father Flynn, about his interest in becoming a priest. Father Flynn also gives Donald morale support, when Donald is harassed by some white students.One day, Sister James witnesses Father Flynn summoning Donald into a private meeting, in the Rectory. She also sees Father Flynn place Donald's T-shirt, into a locker. When Donald returns to his desk after his meeting with Father Flynn, Donald seems upset to Sister James. She also notices the odor of alcohol, on Donald's breath. Suspecting that Father Flynn had lured Donald into a carnal tryst inside the Rectory, Sister James goes immediately to Sister Aloysius with her concerns.Meanwhile, Father Flynn wants the school to become more progressive, and reach-out more to their congregation. His philosophy is in direct opposition, to the old-fashioned mentality of Sister Aloysius. She thinks that order and propriety, are more important than the more congenial values, espoused by Father Flynn. After Sister James confronts Sister Aloysius with her terrible suspicions regarding Father Flynn, Sister Aloysius is 'certain' that Father Flynn is guilty. And she's determined to prove that the seemingly benign, compassionate Father Flynn, is truly a proverbial wolf-in-sheep's-clothing.Meryl Streep should win an Oscar, for her stellar performance as Sister Aloysius. As a woman on the cusp of being a senior citizen, Meryl fit nicely into the role of the dignified, elder nun. Phillip Seymore Hoffman, was also a good choice to play Father Flynn. Hoffman portrays Father Flynn with just enough of a smarmy aura, to make the view believe that he could really be a devil-in-disguise.Doubt is a deep, and moving drama. It's an intelligent film, that makes the viewer question their own assumptions about human nature. I highly recommend it, especially for Meryl Streep fans.",Doubt
151,fablesofthereconstru-1,"It's a man's world, sister",7,29 December 2008,"Before she had doubts, Sister Aloysius Beauvier(Meryl Streep) used to be a dutiful nun who abided by the stringent hierarchy that upholds the social infrastructure of the Catholic church. As Father Flynn(Phillip Seymour Hoffman) delivers a sermon to his rapt congregation, the less rapt spring into erect upright positions at the slightest touch and whispered admonitory words from the abetting nun. Although Sister Aloysius exerts a formidable will over the students, her dominion ends there, because there is no jurisdiction for a man of the cloth; no containment for their unchecked power. Waking the children is merely a rote exercise the nun performs out of quotidian habit that no longer has any correlation with the speaker/listener channel she, by all appearances, still boosts in pious earnestness. The outset of ""Doubt"" catches Sister Aloysius in midstream, an overdue dawning that priests are fallible men whose words should be held up to critical thinking, not blind acceptance. Even before the principle of a New England parochial school brings forth her accusation of choirboy abuse against Flynn into the light, a rehearsal for discordance is well underway by posing questions about the father's exhortations. Complicit no more, the principles with principles, goes on the offensive against an institution she knows, produces monsters who protect other monsters under the noses of their flocks.In the film's pivotal scene, Flynn gets summoned to the principal's chambers after Sister James(Amy Adams) raises the possibility of an infraction against Father Flynn, who was alone with a student in the rectory. Donald(Joseph Foster) returned to her classroom with alcohol on his breath. Before the interrogation takes place, Flynn rattles the nun by stealing her agency; he occupies the seat behind her desk and reduces this servant of god into his own personal servant, taking three lumps of sugar with his coffee. Flynn commandeers the discourse by off-handedly purporting that their impromptu meeting is a result of the upcoming Christmas pageant. Like a seasoned politician, the priest bides his time by getting the chaste ladies off-topic, advocating that the church meld with the secularized world to appear less intimidating to its followers and the curious. When the priest suggests they mix in ""Frosty the Snowman"" along with the traditional hymns, misogyny emanates out of ""Doubt"". Without a doubt, Sister Aloysius sounds like a loon with her proselytized world view that the popular Christmas tune is heretical and subversive. Her hard line of extremism only gives credence to Flynn's assertion that the church needs to open up. But the nun regains her bearings and steers the conversation towards Donald, who it should be noted, is black, and more importantly, black during a period of social unrest. Smack dab in the Civil Rights Movement, Sister Aloysius comes off as faintly racist when describing how Donald should be appropriated in the program. Talk about Donald's ethnicity transitions into speculation about how Flynn exploited the boy's otherness. The strong prey on the weak, and being the token black in an all-Irish parochial school, would indeed make Donald susceptible to trading favors for protection. The camera is noticeably tilted when Flynn gets attacked by the nun's certainty that he acted inappropriately with the minority choirboy. The nun's certainty feminizes the patriarchal diegesis, creating a topsy-turvy world of her own making, which the camera captures through the projection of a woman's slant made dissonant by her sheer gall to challenge the establishment. As the vehement nun lashes out at the priest, the phone rings, which fails to impede her reprimand, as would the rings from a sanctus bell had Flynn been in possession of one, or a church bell, should the liturgical text itself wanted to protect its petitioner.Late in ""Doubt"", Sister Aloysius wonders aloud about who keeps opening her window. The culprit, of course, is she, a woman in doubt about her faith, who at one point, holds the crucifix like a weapon in Flynn's presence, which leads us to ask if the crucifix in repose is a weapon against women's suffrage. The woman already lost her husband in a world war, now she's losing her faith in a liturgical one. By shutting her window, shutting herself from the outside world, the nun is only prolonging her ignorance. Sister Aloysius' answer lies in the blowin' wind(Bob Dylan released ""Blowin' in the Wind"" in 1963; the film takes place a year later), not the church. Although she hates secular music, a folksong doesn't have the patriarchal connotations of a hymn(homonymously speaking, a hymn can be a ""him"").",Doubt
152,gcrokus,"Not an Academy Award Winner, but close",8,12 February 2009,"""Doubt"" is a troubling film, and is intended to be, making us mull over the events that unfold. This picture is not for the plex crowd; it is too much an art house affair. In fact I would label it one of the top non-action films of the year. While I never looked at my watch, primarily due to the first-rate acting and seeming plausibility of the situation, any need for exterior shots is quite noticeable. One can almost always tell when a play is adapted into a movie in just the first few minutes.Set and filmed in the Bronx, the movie quickly develops a taut narrative regarding a nun - Sister Aloysius Beauvier - (Meryl Streep) and a priest, the former of which accuses Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) of some form of abuse of an altar boy/student at the parish. The interplay of any other characters by the priest and nun completely overshadows the substantial contributions of the supporting cast - the mother of the boy, a nun assigned to teach under the ministrations of Streep and a few others. But this is a sparse and compact tale, one which does not require any more subplots to mar the nun/priest interplay. What happens as snippets of detail are deliciously revealed is just enough to continue to sow the fields of uncertainty we feel. Hoffman's turn as a priest is quite believable, and he mentions in an interview that he only learned enough of the ceremonial side of things to validate his portrayal. As he says, ""the play is not really about the Catholic church. The venue has to be convincing but ultimately what we're getting at is something that's not about the Catholic church. It's about something else"" (www.canmag.com -Philip Seymour Hoffman interview).And this film will certainly conjure doubt in your mind. Definitely a top-shelf series of performances makes this one of the must-see films during the Academy Award campaign.",Doubt
153,tubby1,Don't doubt the intentions but its means,6,21 February 2010,"Doubt, adapted from the very successful play, produces strong performances and interesting thematic endeavours. However, all its efforts to provide a discussion on morality, or psychological suspicions is hampered by its open-ended conclusion, which bases the film in a theoretical rather than real-world bias.Doubt, is very much a character driven film and is heartened by its fine cast. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Father Flynn, a seemingly kind and well liked character who provides a nuanced performances of ambiguity. The principal of the school Sister Aloysius is the opposite to Father Flynn, she is respected in the congregation but is a stern and authoritative influence on the pupils. Merryl Streep gives enough venom and underhanded wit as Sister Aloysius to make her agreeable and obtuse in equal measure. In between the two is the sweetly-innocent Sister James (played by Amy Admas), who acts as I suppose a mediator between Flynn and Aloysius. James can be seen as the voice of reason, as she is the only other person open to the discussion. However, I would add that although her thinking and actions are logical, she is too weak to bring any bearing on the outcome and is handily away from the film when Doubt begins to unroll.Doubt is finely directed and I like the way it uses symbolism such as Sister Aloysius annoyance of open windows to project her traditionalist and non-flexible views. Yet although the film is setup nicely between the modern priest and traditionalist nun it is orchestrated with exact precision to provide an ambiguous outcome. Although I believe one scene in particular certainly conveyed if Flynn was guilty of the suspicions, you have to accept that Doubt is a film concerned with theoretical leanings. Doubt is delivered to be an intelligent tale about suspicion. However, logically the screenplay does not play ball. The questions, which would be raised and would need to be certainly investigated are left to linger frustratingly on the peripheral. It is never the films intention to provide a clearer and rounded picture but to cast us adrift from the real to a theoretical debate surrounding 'gossip' and 'intolerance.' The intentions of Doubt are good and its purpose does stir up debate, however if you cannot accept its intentions,you are left slightly cheated by its refusal to progress along a more thorough foundation.",Doubt

There were many unrealistic and overly dramatic aspects to the film and the ending was even more contrived and pathetic - much like seeing the rat walk across the screen at the end The Departed - and most of all, the lack of full resolution left the viewer unsatisfied.The only real positive is that it was nominated for 5 Oscars, but didn't win 1.

155,blackburnj-1,Superb Acting + Brilliant Writing = Great Film,9,1 February 2009,"The prospect of screen legends Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman together in a film, along with the increasingly impressive Amy Adams, is an extremely appetizing one. Added to that, the film in question is an adaptation of a Pulitzer Prize winning play and, to the joy of film geeks, is being brought to life by composers, photographers and other filmmakers who are at the top of their game.So much expectation has been built up, and with great expectations comes an even greater possibility of disappointment. However, we are in very safe hands here and, from very early on, this film proves to be a gripping and interesting piece, superbly brought to life by, not one, not two, not even three, but four brilliant performances.The film is set in 1964, around a Catholic school. The Catholic community is still reeling from the death of JFK the year before and is at the dawn of a new age. This is the time of Vatican 2 and change is in the air. In the school, Father Flynn (Hoffman) is open to the winds of change and aware of the world outside of his church and school. Meanwhile, the principal, Sister Aloysius (Streep), is deeply conservative in her thoughts and methods. In between them both, is the suggestible innocent, Sister James (Adams). James momentarily suspects that Flynn has done something to a boy and Aloysius adopts a position of absolutely certainty in the truth of the accusation, leading the principal and Father to enter into a battle of wits and gender.The great joy of this film is that one can sit back, relax and enjoy the superb acting at any time. Streep's role could so easily have become a stern, uncompromising old bag, but she manages to give Sister Aloysius a tremendous amount of depth. The nun does not enter into making these accusations without a sense of duty and care. Why she is sometimes difficult to understand is because she is of a different time.Streep's sparring with Hoffman is delightful to watch, as Hoffman manages to inject Father Flynn with appropriate ambiguity. One wants to trust him from the start but often feels that the trust may be misplaced. Hoffman delicately constructs his performance, ensuring that one is always gripped by his presence.Meanwhile, in two key supporting roles, Amy Adams and Viola Davis (as the mother of the boy in the alleged case) are outstanding. Adams's portrayal of the well-meaning innocent who doesn't know what to think, or who to believe, demonstrates the kind of depth which her career has hinted at but has not, hitherto, delivered. Viola Davis, meanwhile, delivers a bold performance as the petrified African-American who is only interested in ensuring her son's and her own survival as she is faced by the obstacles of prejudice and an abusive husband.The film's greatest obstacle is that, as it is adapted from a very wordy play, it is susceptible to being quite stagey. At times, it does indeed fall into this trap, but the combined weight of Howard Shore's subtle score, Roger Deakins and Matt Turve's careful cinematography (the use of Dutch angles being particularly impressive) and John Patrick Shanley's engrossing writing is enough to save it from being an un-cinematic adaptation.As the film draws toward its conclusion, there are moments which are spine-tingling. It is a powerful film and an intelligent one. Whilst it may not be perfect, it is more than worth going to see if only for the magnificent acting. It is rare that a cast of this quality is seen performing material which is so good, and it is an opportunity which must not be missed.4 Stars out of 5",Doubt
156,Monotreme02,"One of the most accomplished, multi-faceted films of the year; incredible acting",9,11 January 2009,"The most important element in the film is the acting. Throughout history the actors have always been the most important aspect of stage plays, a fact that has crossed over into the film adaptation of this particular stage play. The film features a broad and very talented supporting cast, but four performances in particular stand out from the crowd as being particularly prominent. First and foremost, there is Amy Adams as Sister James, a young actress who has been around for a while now but only truly caught prominence after her Oscar nomination for her wonderful performance in the mediocre film Junebug. Since then she has received her first starring role, in Disney's Enchanted, in which she showcased even more range and a wonderful skill for comedy and drama. With Doubt, Adams treads even new ground and delivers her most dramatic, mature and most fulfilled role yet; although she's not as prominent as the other veteran thespians in the cast, she still manages to stand her own against them and leave a lasting impression. It's a great performance. Next up is Philip Seymour Hoffman, in the lead role as Father Flynn, the priest accused of molestation of one of his altar boys by his opposing force and the other lead character, Syster Aloyisus. Hoffman has also been around for quite some time now but ever since his Oscar win for Capote has he really been considered an acting force to be reckoned with. I have been a fan of his for a long time, and I think that it's absolutely wonderful that recently he finally been getting the recognition he deserves and is considered by many (myself included) to be one of the finest actors working today. Throughout his illustrious career, Hoffman has shown impeccable range in his roles, and now he can add Father Flynn to his arsenal as one of his most accomplished, rounded, and best performances. Relatively unknown compared to the rest of the cast, Viola Davis, portraying Mrs. Miller, the mother of the boy who may or may not have been molested, has only one scene in the movie that lasts no more than a few minutes, but it leaves a lasting impression as one of the best and most powerful scenes in the movie. In it, she showcases such raw, visceral emotion; you can feel the desperation behind her anxious, darting eyes. Hopefully, this performance will go down in history as one of the great ""single-scene"" performances, along with Beatrice Straight, who won an Oscar for her six-minute appearance in Network.But the fourth performance is so delightful, so magnificent, so grand and bombastic and significant, that it deserves its own paragraph, although it can be summed up in two words: Meryl Streep. A few months ago I saw the movie Sophie's Choice for the first time, and I was utterly stupefied, totally blown away by what quickly became, in my opinion, the single greatest female performance of all time. It was at that time that it suddenly hit me that Meryl Streep is probably the single greatest actress of all time, and now, 25 years later, Streep proves that she still deserves that title. Her performance in Doubt is so good, that I really find it quite difficult to put into words. Every single little detail and aspect of the performance is nailed, to perfection, by Streep. Every facial tic, every eye-rolling, every mouth twitch, every pause in the dialogue, every sigh  it is one of the most beautifully, amazingly calculated performances I have ever seen, and I don't think any actress other than Streep could have pulled it off quite as well. She nails the Bronx accent, the body language, the tone of voice  it's a sight to behold, and I think the film is worth checking out for her performance alone, although of course there is much more to it than that. My favourite actress is Kate Winslet, and what I want most for her is to finally win a long-time, much-deserved Oscar; this year, with two acclaimed performances, her chances seem better than ever  and yet, if there is any justice in the world, Streep will win her third Oscar for her performance in this film. It's that good, and it is, by far, the best performance of the year.Doubt is one of the most accomplished, multi-faceted films of the year, and that is because it has so many elements going for it that are so expertly done. It is based on a brilliant, clever, witty screenplay by John Patrick Shanley, adapted from his play and featuring a compelling story, sympathetic, well-developed and rounded characters as well as touching upon broad theological, philosophical and sociological themes and allegories. It features the best acting ensemble seen in any film this year, with Amy Adams, Viola Davis and Philip Seymour Hoffman delivering some of the best acting of the year, and Meryl Streep going even further and giving us the single best performance of the year and one of her personal bests. And overall, Doubt is a fascinating, gripping tale that is heavily dramatic but also features many moments of humour; meaningful and significant, wildly entertaining and thrilling to watch, and keeps you thinking about it both during its runtime and after it's over. One of the best films of the year.",Doubt

158,commandercool88,Electrifying and Smart,8,14 January 2009,"Where Frosty the Snowman is a heretic. Where gossip are feathers in the wind. Where doubt is just as powerful as certainty. Bringing his Pulitzer Prize winning play to the silver screen, John Patrick Shanley directs 'Doubt' with a steady hand and watchful eye. It is simultaneously a metaphorically obvious picture and one steeped in ambiguity. And while it stays away from saying profound about the Church, 'Doubt' is nevertheless a breathlessly engrossing and captivating tale.'Doubt' unfolds very much the same way a stage play would. This may be a handicap for some, but in bringing his own work to the screen, Shanley's deep understanding of the material allows the picture to showcase the terrific talent it plays home to. There is nothing particularly arresting about Shanley's direction, no powerful insight. He knows where the true power lies, and he allows the film's obviously capable cast to command the wheel.With a stare that could turn fire to stone, Meryl Streep demands unconditional attention in 'Doubt'. It is a delicious performance, wrought with unreadable poker faces and deadpan delivery. Only Streep, one of film's greatest talents, could deliver such a role so convincingly. She is joined alongside her noble adversary Philip Seymour Hoffman around every corner, and the cat and mouse game that ensues is explosive and smart. These are two giants going at each other in an intense psychological battle that culminates in many memorable clashes thanks to a sharp script that mounts tension.Alas, the supreme scene-stealing moment comes from neither Streep, Hoffman, or the wonderful Amy Adams. Viola Davis' single scene provides 'Doubt' one of the year's most impressive show-stopping moments. It's one thing to star alongside Streep. It's another to upstage her. It really is something to watch and admire, a profoundly moving role that will surely earn her an Oscar nomination.With so much bubbling under the surface, 'Doubt' shows great restraint in not letting the cat out of the bag. Symbols are overly abundant, whether it's a blown out light bulb or powerful wind. But like the film's true nature, certainty lies just out of reach. Ambiguity lends its hand to create a rather unsettling atmosphere that raises more questions than answers. It's a high-quality production across the board, and while it may not leave a huge impact, it's a very potent film that will leave one with much to ponder. Who will you believe? Who will you find sympathy for? Who will you doubt? More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Doubt

But I want to leave much of this excellent movie's excellence alone and say, simply, that Streep has never been better. Which is saying a lot. As perfect as the other performances are, Streep eclipses them and she invests the character with an authentic lifetime's worth of human experience. Astonishingly, she manages to render a hard and unpleasant character with the degree of humanity such people are imbued with in real life, and she does it through no tricks to gain sympathy, but in staying true to the role.

161,SimonHeide,When the Dragon is hungry.,7,9 February 2009,"The story takes place in 1964 in Bronx and we follow a conflict - and it's consequences - between a nun (Meryl Streep) and a priest (Philip Seymour). The priest has taken a special interest in a black boy and this seems suspicious to the nuns. The term ""sexual abuse"" is never used but we sense that this is the issue here.We are never certain as to what happened between the priest and the boy and this challenges the viewer in several ways. What do you do when you have a suspicion but no evidence? Are you in fact innocent until proved guilty? On deciding what to believe what do you underscore as important in a story like this? These are questions who are very difficult to answer without a considerable amount of ""Doubt"" in a case like this.In a sense this movie is similar to watching a detective story. In certain aspects it reminded me of ""12 angry men"" where we follow the jury trying to decide whether a young boy has killed his father. The story never reveals if the boy is guilty but here the jury, because of the ""innocent until proved guilty"" code, decides that the boy is ""not guilty"". Sister Aloysius is Father Flynns judge and jury and decides to be so without any evidence because ""she knows people"" as she puts it.Her motive for pursuing the case to such an extent is another challenge to the viewer. Is it out of compassion with the boy or is it because she has a much more conservative world view than the priest that she wants him out of the way so that the school can return to normal again? Doubt can be very annoying and grow to such an extent that it paralysis you but on the other hand Certainty can be just as undesirable which is what I think the story is also trying to tell us.I will recommend this movie for it's dialogue and acting and for having the quality of forcing the viewer to become the judge himself with the moral dilemmas accordingly.Regards SimonPs.

Today most flicks are for kids or a kid's mind. This film was executed with much passion, yet restraint.It involves a nun who perceives a child predator priest moving from victim to victim. No one believes a priest could be guilty of such evil. The plot is made complicated by a black mother who has a gay son. The problem of course, the kid is only 12 years old on the radar screen of Father Flynn, a pedophile.The drama is excellent and the doubt is not that the good Father has violated a boy, rather that the Church disbelieves the messenger.

Stripping it of the religious embellishments, the film raises some grave questions about the very bud of faith and tackles the concept of certainty Vs doubt. Which is more human? Which is more soul-gratifying? And most importantly, which is closer to the truth?

164,westpenn49,From the opening sermon the die was cast,10,1 June 2009,"Seldom has a screenplay delivered more, even more rarely has a cast risen to such heights. I was utterly blown away by the opening sermon. For a religious leader to even admit to the possibility of doubt is to invite the wrath of the congregants. I know I admitted my struggles with a Biblical passage to my congregation and heard quickly ""We do not pay you to struggle, we pay you to tell how it is"" So it was with Father Flynn, after admitting the possibility of doubt as a unifying factor in a community of faith, his faith was in question and it was a matter of time before the forces of ""good"" would find a way to send him away.This is one of the most powerful films of all time. That priests have been guilty is not the point, that priests have also been forces for good and instruments of God's love is more the point. That parishioners cannot tell the difference, especially with the help of well meaning ""experts"" is all the more the point.Was Father Flynn guilty, maybe, we will never know. Was Father Flynn driven away unjustly, the victim of self righteousness however justified, yes.Justice was not served, but the universal truth of human nature was brutally and honestly carried out in this masterpiece. Streep, Hoffman, Adams and Davis all deserve the highest credit for conveying with honesty the characters that they played. This is a story for the ages.",Doubt
165,tml_pohlak_13,"Forgive you, Father, for you have sinned... maybe.",10,9 June 2009,"SPOILERS EVERYWHERE!I knew practically from the very first I heard of it that Doubt was a movie that I'd want to see. I was positively mind blown when I first saw it. John Patrick Shanley wrote the play on which the film is based as well as the screenplay, and he also directed the film. This is exactly why Doubt worked so well, I believe. Shanley is the original author— everything about the play is in his mind, and it doesn't undergo someone's interpretation of his vision. Thus, a pristine version of Shanley's play is translated on screen, the result being far better than most stage-to-screen productions.In addition, Doubt is one of the best-cast films ever made. Meryl Streep plays Sister Aloysius, an extremely conservative, authoritarian nun with an iron grip on her school (of which she is the principal). The students are completely frightened of her, a literal holy terror. When the audience first sees Aloysius, only her back is shown. She is in church. She begins walking around, correcting improper behaviour. Such a presence emanates from her, that the audience immediately feels a sort of antagonism, although the conflict has not even been introduced—it has been hardly 5 minutes into the film. Streep, one of the most talented and versatile modern Hollywood actresses, steals the show. Never does Sister Aloysius become a caricature of a tyrant. She is a person whose personal prejudices blind her to possibility that her suspicions may be unfounded. Eventually, when she does give way to doubts, she feels guilty, and yet, reluctantly admits so.Phillip Seymour Hoffman was snubbed at the Oscars by being nominated for Best Supporting Actor, a category that Heath Ledger was obviously going to win for his fantastic portrayal of The Joker. Hoffman plays a pivotal leading role in the film, and should've been nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role. He certainly won in my book. Hoffman's Father Flynn is introduced as a sympathetic character. He reminded me of many a priest I know for his jolly demeanour and his compassionate nature. However, the film inevitably gets the audience to doubt whether Flynn is really innocent. In the end, though, I came to the conclusion that Flynn was a good priest and wrongly accused. He was too progressive for Sister Aloysius, who promptly sought to destroy him. Flynn acts with compassion towards the school's only black student, who is ruthlessly teased by others. Because he doesn't deal with him sternly, Aloysius automatically decides something is wrong with it. In addition, during several scenes, Flynn gives sermons during Mass. Hoffman's line delivery (and the sermon itself, for which Shanley must receive due credit) could've come directly from an actual homily. Hoffman's portrayal of Flynn is so fantastic because he captures not just the uncertain side of Father Flynn, but also his priestly nature (after all, it is Flynn's job).Another of the film's true stars is Amy Adams. She perfectly encapsulates the character of Sister James, an innocent young nun who shares Flynn's kind-hearted nature. When she begins to emulate Sister Aloysius' traits in her classroom, yelling at students and sending them down to the principal's office, a feeling of horror settles in. How can this kind woman suddenly become a clone of her superior? The downfall (although, judging by the film's end, temporary) of her innocent humanity is powerful to say the least.Even if you think Doubt's acting was terrible, even if you hated the storyline, you cannot help but admit that the film is beautiful. It looks beautiful. The cinematographer is Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men), and he just does a fantastic job of handling the camera. One of the most beautiful shots occurs after Viola Davis' scene comes to an end, as Sister Aloysius walks off alone, the wind blowing leaves around her. The camera movement is just beautiful, rendering the shot not only aesthetically pleasing, but also effective. Deakins' cinematography and Shanley's direction are key elements that make Doubt far better than the average stage-turned-screen production. In the average play, the locations remain the same (or are similar, with minor alterations), so as to make scene transitions smooth, fast, and not inconvenient. As a result, many plays turned movies have an extremely static feel to them, making it boring. Doubt, however, goes far beyond the play it originally was (one for four people in a couple of rooms onstage). The action shifts from place to place, it is filmed on location in New York, and as a result, it gains a richness rarely seen in films, transcending far above its theatrical origins. A truly one-of-a-kind cinematic experience, Doubt's direction and cinematography are brilliant and practically flawless.The Verdict: From an artistic point of view, there is a huge difference between the terms ""movie"" and ""film"". A movie can be fun entertainment, but in the end, doesn't add up to too much. To me, film is an art form. A film is brilliantly executed, entertaining, thought-provoking, and deep. Undoubtedly, Doubt qualifies as a brilliant filmic achievement, a cinematic opus magnum.Overall Rating: 10/10",Doubt
166,lizziebeth-1,Doesn't know how to end a talky yet bereft argument! Only 5/10 for this indie.,5,20 January 2009,"This is just a quickie based on 1 viewing.Clearly the filmmakers intended Doubt(208) to be at least self-referencing for the audience, that is, they never had any intention of settling the priest's guilt with the plot. I went in expecting that.However it was a rude shock to see this ultimately nothing-but talky movie offer only homilies couched in a few sentences of priestly sermon about gossiping being a sin, and valuable truths being easily dissembled into flying feathers that you can never collect again.There is no better case than this made or attempted by the movie for its subject.Good one-note premise inadequately realised with a few measly conversations and one screaming match. Oh, and one honest mother.That's it.The movie doesn't go anywhere, and then it ends.There is a little bit of throwaway hindsight in the shape of Meryl Streep's nun finally regretting (or being afraid of) her own unsupportable certainty; and the information that what happened in this case too was that the accused priest was just moved on but never dealt with. On the contrary he was promoted in another parish for having suffered her accusations.But of course nothing was decided then, nor is it in this movie.The cast is universally very good (Viola Davis as the Afr-Am actress mother is even better than Hoffman or Streep. She is just WONDERFUL as she cries about her tormented only son in a world that refused to understand).The 1960s period recreation is great, too. However the unexamined possibilities of the other schoolboys' stories is INFURIATING. I have no patience for movies which deliberately hide certain points of view in order to set up their meagre case.If the interpretation is this poorly developed in order to make its case, then it simply hasn't made it.I did not need or want this confusing, mired ""vision"" of such a confusing and brutal reality repeated on film for no good reason, and with nothing else to offer.Waste of ""vision"" for an indie; Scott Rudin and John Patrick Shanley (Writer/Director) - are letting their fans down.

DOUBT's story centres around child molestation within the Church, while simultaneously tackling race relations. But it is nowhere as simple as it may sound. The story is a complex and diverse one, and there are so many little things occurring that have significant implications and hidden meanings that it may take more than one viewing to fully digest. This film will make an excellent study at film school at almost any level. The mood created by John Patrick Shanley is profoundly morose and cold, with the sense that something is always looming on the horizon, threatening to boil over. In life, there are rarely any simple answers, and such is the case with DOUBT. Those searching for gratification at the end may find very little. All that comes long after the film has stopped rolling.The acting is top-drawer, good enough to garner no less than four nominations, and could very well win two of them. Meryl Streep gets better with age and experience, and her portrayal of the head Nun and Principal is flawless. Of course, the movie may not have worked well with a weak opposite, and Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is anything but weak,as he holds his own against Streep in every scene, and sometimes outshines her. Supporting roles from Amy Adams and Viola Davis are similarly impeccable. Adams is solid and reliable throughout and is the easiest character to associate with. Davis, in her one and only scene is simply outstanding, and will silence the audience into submission. Her scene is also one of the more important in terms of story development.So much can be said about this excellent film, all of it good. 9/10. 4 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 150 at 140.

170,dj_xand325,"Doubt is an explosive, intense, riveting, endearing picture with knock-out performances",9,6 February 2009,"John Patrick Shanley's Pulitzer prize winning play has been given a shift onto the screen. Interestingly, Shanley chose to write the screenplay and direct the film which allows for a raw and unchanged account of Shanley's compelling storyline. The story of doubt is very simple, a priest (Father Flynn, Phillip Seymour Hoffman) at a 1960s American parish school is accused of molesting a pupil by the principal nun(Sister Aloysius Beauvier, Meryl Streep). Throughout most of the film, the story is remarkably open-ended, there is no dramatic irony here, there is no indication on who is right here (except perhaps the ending). Aloysius is acting on impulse, perhaps even a God given impulse, that Flynn is abusing a child. Yet on the other side, Flynn seems to be a very respectable, decent and benevolent priest and just wants to do good.We are torn between the harsh yet observant character of Aloysius and the loving yet strangely ominous character of Father Flynn. This film is all about doubt, there is never a certain moment in the film, we are constantly trying to guess what is truly going on, who is right, what side to go on. This constant aura of uncertainty can also be a symbol included by Shanley of the moral dilemma in religion. Flynn argues that the aim of Christianity is to love and that is what he is doing yet Aloysius is stating that God wants us to always seek wrong-doing. Of course, both are right yet the film still suggests that one is wrong In a way, Doubt questions the moral fabric of Christianity as a whole whilst telling a story of true uncertainty that requires the highest amount of audience participation I have ever seen in a movie.Meryl Streep pulled off yet another magnificent performance as Sister Aloysius. Such a role had the potential to fall flat on its face as a clichéd, bitch-faced nun yet Streep put something different into the character that was very interesting. It will be very close in terms of the best actress academy award, it looks as if it will be a two-horse race between Streep and Winslet. Hoffman was also great to watch as Father Flynn whilst Amy Adams was surprisingly good in her role as Sister James, she could be a dark horse in the best supporting actress academy award category.Doubt is morally complex yet devilishly simple, short yet explosive, and exceptionally acted.9/10",Doubt

The priest is played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and the nun investigating (Sister Aloysius, great name) the situation is played by Meryl Streep, the best living actress and the best actress of the year. The language used in the film treats the situation very carefully and the confrontations between the characters crackle with well- written intensity.

This was an excellent screen adaptation of the award-winning play by director, John Patrick Shanley which ultimately resulted in a uniquely liberating, somewhat painful, yet truly thought-provoking viewing experience. Kudos goes to the principal players, Meryl Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Viola Davis and Joseph Foster, all of whom gave wrenching award-worthy performances.The story is set in the mid-sixties, not long after the assassination of JFK. A Catholic school in the Bronx accepts its first black student, Donald Miller, beautifully portrayed by Joseph Foster. The priest, wonderfully realized by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is truly empathetic and realizing what a struggle it must be for the student, keeps an eye on him to make sure he adjusts well to this new and very intricate situation. Because of his attention, one sister, a very effective Amy Adams, initially becomes slightly suspicious of his motives and, unfortunately, reports her suspicions to the principal, an exceedingly pedagogical nun, exquisitely played by Meryl Streep. She, of course, confronts the priest with her suspicions which he vehemently denies and she steadfastly refuses to believe. She even confronts the boy's mother, portrayed by Viola Davis who gives a wrenching performance. The encounter between these two is as taut and revealing as those between the accusing nun and the outraged priest. The overall dialogue is crisp, biting, poignant and positively riveting.Certain aspects of this whole scenario evoked poignant memories making it rather easy for me to relate to. Moreover, certain revelations the mother made to the nun re the boy's home life raised VERY serious questions. These questions will be at the focal point of any discussions about the play for the simple reason the author wisely neither confirmed nor denied those suspicions which, obviously, was pivotal to the whole theme. Any ""doubts"" you find yourself faced with while watching this further fuels the profound impact the film makes because in the final analysis, it will be up to the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions - as well it should be. The ending is little short of devastating.With such a riveting and important play being realized by a positively flawless cast, this could hardly miss. Just eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeescellent.

(Yes, I know that a lot of nuns back then, and even still some today are that way.) Doubt is cast on the innocence of a relationship between a young boy and a Catholic priest. Streep, convinced beyond any doubt that the priest (Hoffman) is guilty of wrongdoing, works her hardest throughout the film to have him ousted....finally succeeding. I don't know, I guess I expected a film with a little more power displayed from the actors. Only Hoffman seemed to display any passion when defending his character. I think they had a good idea, but from idea to screen, anything interesting was lost in translation, transforming itself into dull, lifeless form. To top it off, Streep confesses to fellow nun (Adams) in the last scene that she had ""such doubt"" (off his guilt) after all. WHAT?!First off, it defeats the whole purpose of the film. Secondedly, i've already accepted her as some crony old nun rock solid in her ways. don't give her human characteristics right before the credits roll.Thank goodness I saw this at the cheapie theater, because I still felt offended leaving, but at least I had to lose out on only $3.50.

The other is a hard headed, strict school principal with a chip on her shoulder about being subjected to the male in the hierarchical ecclesiastical establishment in which she in a part of. She too has her ""doubts"". A mental battle ensues between the two, as one develops a strong suspicion without any concrete proof.-SPOILER ALERT- (Maybe) ----- The movie does not reveal what actually happens or what he did which leaves it for us to make our own interpretations of the situation. This will foster debate about the issues of whether or not he did do it and other more universal and larger ideas concerning religion and morality. -----A focus is on the characters and their personalities but the movie fell short of delving deeply into personal development. A revelation of this character's past or an explanation of why she is who she is as the extremely uptight, strict uncompassionate person could have fulfilled this necessary gap.The younger teacher caught in the middle had an innocent naivety throughout the whole situation. The play on her innocence against the probably morally tainted, sexually gregariously off priest and the embittered, ""experienced"" in the deceptive nature of individuals, principal/nun was one of the most delightfully amusing parts of the story.Much is said about the performances of the two great actors. When watching Hoffman you become immersed into his character, he does an excellent job. On the other hand, it feels as though you are watching Streep, which distracts from the character who she should create. She repeated the same emotions, mannerisms and expressions as we've seen in her other movies except in this case it was in a slightly over the top fashion.

Philip Seymore Hoffman is the spitting image of a priest in that era. The image of overly stern and punishing Nun is pretty close too. This is not a film that I would watch again and again, but it is a great window for looking back into the early '60s Catholic Church. This also touches on the subject of pediophile priests. I can say that I have not met one who I was wondering about. Probably the strongest fole of all was the mother of the boy at the center of this entire film. She puts in an award winning performance.",Doubt
178,Cheetah-6,Do You Wonder,8,30 December 2008,Overall this film is a compelling look at the power of suspicion and how it can color one's interpretation of events and appearances.Phillip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as the priest in question. Streep's and Adam's portrayals of catholic nun's feel a bit like caricatures at times but overall are sufficiently believable.The power of this film is the crevice it places the viewer in between actual proof and mere probability while never resolving all reasonable doubt. Situations can be more complicated than meets the eye when one begins to scratch below the surface. Individuals are more than what isolated deeds may say about them.Personally I enjoy movies that leave you in a place of uncertainty and wonder .,Doubt
179,treadwaywrites,Subject Matter Seems Too Late,7,8 March 2009,"About 10 years ago this film may have been considered cutting edge. Certainly the subject matter is still considered a hot button in many sects of the country. The performances in Doubt are given by two of the best actors of our times. I can't help feel that the subject matter is just a little late and with that feeling comes a little heavy handed as well.The film is set in a Catholic school, the Bronx and the year is 1964. Father Flynn (Academy Award winner Philip Seymour Hoffman), seems to be trying to bring the church and school's culture into a new age. Unfortunately for him Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Academy Award winner Meryl Streep) is holding onto her disciplines as closely as she can. The school has just accepted their first black student while Sister Aloysius begins to suspect the Father of inappropriate attention, in fact child molestation.Though the original play came out a couple of years after the Catholic Church sex scandals, the time has been set in 1964. Rest assured there are some weighty issues that come with this film. There are no easy answers and many many undertones and ambiguity. The film looks and feels stage-like. The movie never clearly seems to make that necessary crossover into the film world and we are left feeling like an audience instead of a voyeur.The performances are very good, the actors are top notch and try to work with the material. The writing is also good, without taking on the challenges of converting to the screen. The film always seems limited by the confines of the stage. Academy Award winning screenwriter John Patrick Shanley (""Moonstruck"") adapted his own play for the screen and I think he was just too close to the material. Add to that Mr. Shanley directed his own script. There is some good, juicy work here on everyone's part, but it never quite clicks for me. There are many chances to make a social comment on the sex scandals but just when we get close Shanley takes us in another direction.",Doubt

Unless someone tells me this is based on real life events of that time, I simply don't believe that Nuns would do this, even until very recently, Nuns would be totally (for want of a better word) subservient to Priests, so even if such suspicions would occur to them, which would be unlikely, I can't imagine any of them doing a single thing about it. Although I like the period look, I think it would have been more realistic to have been set much later, 80's or early 90's even! If this doesn't bother you, it's a good watch.",Doubt
181,John_Truby,"A strong Moral Argument, but no emotional connection",7,6 January 2010,"Drama is a story structure based on exploring a difficult moral issue in depth. It puts more emphasis on moral argument - concerning the right and wrong way to live - than any other genre, which is both a blessing a curse. In the Great Screen writing and Advanced Screen writing Classes, I explain in detail how to express moral argument through the story structure, instead of presenting it in dialogue like a sermon. When moral argument is done through structure it has tremendous impact on the audience, not because it tells them how to live but because it shows them, in deeply personal terms, the effects that moral decisions have on our lives.Doubt, by John Patrick Shanley, is a classic drama, and it shows clearly the strengths and limitations of the drama form. Because of the form's emphasis on moral argument, the best drama tries to cut the particular issue as close to 51-49 as it can. And Shanley does this quite well. Sister Aloysius is a hard, bigoted, rule-bound woman who accuses another human being of a heinous crime based on no evidence but a feeling. But she is probably right. Father Flynn is a compassionate, gentle and decent man who wants to bring fun and community to the school. But he may be molesting boys. The boy whom the priest is accused of molesting is the first black child at the school. And Father Flynn is his only friend.This balance and complexity is Doubt's great strength and allows Shanley to create two powerful scenes between the nun and the priest that have the quality of a heavyweight fight. But Doubt's great failure - and it is the most serious mistake a drama can make - is that the story is nothing but moral argument. Drama must always be a story first, and that means plot and character development.Plot and character development are the scaffolding on which moral argument must stand. Plot is based on surprise. It's what delights us. It's the game that seduces the audience into facing the pain the drama ultimately causes its characters and all who watch them. Character development is what makes the audience care about the people going through the struggle. It's what makes the emotional connection.Doubt has virtually no plot or character development. We see four characters dealing with a crisis that Sister Aloysius has brought to a head. Almost the entire story is played out in the two big scenes between the priest and the nun. Since the film has no plot or character development, it creates little emotional connection with the audience, so the argument remains intellectual and the mechanics of the drama come to the surface.Without an emotional connection, everything in the film boils down to the quality of the moral accounting, and in this the drama fails. Sister Aloysius uses trickery to force the priest out, but this trickery is not unreasonable or extreme. And it indicates that the priest was probably guilty. So the film ends up supporting not so much her method of attack but her original certainty that he is guilty, even though it is based on nothing but a feeling. This is highly suspect.Shanley seems to realize his moral accounting is skewed. So he has the nun experience an emotional breakdown in the final scene, in which she cries out that she has ""such doubts."" But this moment is both intellectually unbelievable and emotionally phony. Try as hard as she can, Meryl Streep can't bring it off. And if Meryl Streep can't bring it off, there's a good chance the problem is in the script. The result for the audience is a huge letdown. Because the nun's final breakdown and confession of doubt is unbelievable, it doesn't correct the imbalance of the moral argument.Screenwriters who wish to write drama can learn much from this film, especially from its complexity and its hard-hitting dialogue. But most of all we can learn that even drama is a story first, and the old foundations of plot and character development are the keys to greatness.",Doubt
182,peterkowalski,A movie that will leave you without any doubts!,10,6 February 2009,"I am always drawn to movies with religious themes. I don't know why exactly. I believe that there is a certain darkness to every religion, especially in the past, especially in Catholicism. I will spare you the details about the performance, I will only say that a 10-star rating is not nearly enough.It is the ending that struck me the most: strong and rigid Sister B breaking down in tears - having ""doubts"". It is a summary of everything: the movie, the religion, the life even. I don't believe Sister had doubts about her own accusations: a woman so deeply believing in God without having any proof of His existence wouldn't simply break down because nobody believed her. It is my own personal belief (key word being ""belief"") that she is crying over her own lost time, so to speak: the time she sacrificed standing by God and religion and a corrupt environment that has clearly rewarded Flynn. Not that, of course, he was rewarded FOR his actions directly, but he DID get rewarded in the end, did he. Obviously, even though the movie ends, the story does not and perhaps he will be punished - which would make all the viewers' doubts go away - but it is our own faith that must determine if he does. And I'm sure that a strong and religious woman that she is, Sister Beauvier will realize that God is all-knowing and He will punish Flynn for his actions, whatever they may be.""Doubt"" is one of those movies that make you THINK. More power to this title, it makes you think very early on; watching it, you will perhaps wonder WHO exactly is the title referring to - is it Sister James, who is young and oh-so-naive, is it Father Flynn (for obvious reasons), or maybe it is the Sister Beauvier who is simply plain crazy? As the movie progresses, you will see your own beliefs reflected in it: you will take sides and you will get confused. But you will enjoy every movie of it. Simply because it has invoked profound feelings.",Doubt
183,m_shankar20,Great Acting on Display,7,23 March 2009,"Doubt has a stellar cast including Merly Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. But for such competent actors, it would have been impossible to tell a story so layered and open to interpretations.The plot is relatively simple. Streep is a strict, orthodox nun who is the Principal of a school where Hoffman is a new and forward thinking sports teacher. Amy Adams, in a wonderful supporting role, is a history teacher who grows suspicious of Hoffman's relation with the only African-American student in her class. The rest of the story revolves around Streep trying to establish the truth behind the suspicion and Hoffman refuting it. Viola Davis puts in a brilliant cameo performance as the mother of the student.Doubt is a very intelligent and engaging film. Not much is said about the event in question to prevent the audience from taking sides. We are told about the student that 'the nature of the boy' upsets his father. There again a lot is left to guesses and imagination. The film puts the audience as much in doubt as Streep. But she is convinced whereas the audience I'm not sure, probably equally divided.The arguments between Streep and Hoffman is as much about ego clash and power struggle as it is about the doubt. The climax exposes the human side of Streep's character as opposed to the stern, composed and almost mechanical form we see throughout the film. Hoffman throughout is her counterfoil both through his demeanor and thinking.At end, we really don't know who was right and what was the truth. It depends on how much doubtful and certain each viewer is. A must watch.",Doubt

Mesmerizing intensity from Streep as the nun seeking to find Hoffman guilty of a sin he may or may not have committed. Amy Adams gives a sincere performance as the nun who sets the ball rolling with her suspicions that Hoffman may have molested a black student. The scenes between Streep and Hoffman crackle with intelligence and frightening intensity. Streep, as the unrelenting figure of justice, determined at any cost to destroy Hoffman, is terrifying and unrelenting. Hoffman gives a performance less restrained and mannered than the one he gave in Capote (and won the Oscar for) and boy, does he ever deserve to have won a second one for this outing. An absolute knockout, nuanced and convincing in every way. What a masterful performance! John Patrick Shanley's script is riveting from start to finish.

186,aminjacoub,Refined drama,10,27 February 2009,"John Patrick Shanley gave us one of the most pleasant surprise this year, a movie that instantly become classic. Even the movie stands in the group with other Oscar nominees, and even the move did not win any, it is an example of cinematography masterpiece. The plot touches the problem that Church always had and have, in context with pedophile issue, regarding today time line where this is very serious problem, the concept of the plot was intelligently positioned in the era when society where much more conservative, and where something like this where strictly taboo. Even it is not much clear where the character of father Flynn (for witch Philip Seymour Hoffman truly shines) really did for what Sister Aloysius Beauvier (played by extraordinary Meryl Streep) accused him, I think that main problem is emotional connection between the characters (father and the boy), not physical, because there where nothing that would represent physical abusing, and there where few situation that associate need for pure love and attention, like conversation between father Flynn and sister James in the garden. Sister Aloysius Beauvier in this conservative context is depressing, very conservative and suspicion character, yet at the end she projected human character, with the same problem as it have father Flynn. This is core of something that represent the true nature of institution of Church, in this case human beings that have (because of the problem with celibacy concept) constant seducing with natural necessity. The brilliant young actress Amy Adams as Sister James represents very important element, between intolerance and acceptance. Anyway all the superlatives can go to this movie, for acting to directing, complete production, intensity and developing the plot. The superlatives also goes to character developing, and here all the mentioned actors did it brilliantly, also important is to mention great Viola Davis as a mother of a boy as a main issue in the movie. This is one of the movie that you will not forget so easily, and it deserves respect as cinematography masterpiece.",Doubt
187,natalierosen,No Doubt about Doubt,10,27 December 2008,"I saw the newly released film ""Doubt"" yesterday and loved it. This serious multi-faceted enigmatic film starring Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams was, in my opinion, extraordinarily thought provocative and perfectly cast. The film was excellent.The movie takes place in a private Catholic school  perhaps in Boston -- shortly after the death of President Kennedy. It involves Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep), the strict, sour, humorless nun and principal of the elementary school, who makes accusation against a humane and likable parish priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman). She accuses him of committing an immoral act and mortal sin with the lonely and lone African American student and, perhaps, somewhat effeminate, church altar boy whom Father Flynn has befriended.It is thought that by the younger, sweeter, more innocent Sister James (Amy Adams) on Sister Aloysius's order to ""keep an eye on Father Flynn"" because of his sermon on the subject of doubt. Sister James believes, on circumstantial evidence, that Father Flynn may have committed an immoral act with the boy. She has, though, no concrete proof of its occurrence. Sister Aloysius is happy to do the obligatory assault on Father Flynn's character when Sister James provides her with this salacious ammunition however flimsy it20may be.As I watched this, other excellent films came to mind. I thought about Lillian Hellman's 9 CThe Children's Hour,"" a film about a child's lie and the suicidal consequences of that lie as well as that lie's element of truth. I thought about Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible"" and its false accusation of immorality when people see things even when they don't see them and what they will confess to seeing even when it is not there. I thought about how easy it is to bear false witness, to think we see what we do not and to believe false witness testimony, holding the fate of others (perhaps innocent others) in our hands. I finally thought of the Christian element of this film. It is about the possible accusation against a humane and potentially innocent man. It is about the surety of his accuser (Rome) and the torment of the accessory to the punishment (Pilot) because he knows he is condemning an innocent man.This film, though, is not about certainty it is about doubt. Sister Aloysius is, perhaps, the most interesting character. What made her the Dickensian menacing character she was? It is hard to tell but we are told she had a married past -- a nun with a married past? That's all we are told. Sister Aloysius is hard pressed to show an ounce of humanity and in true Dickensian fashion derives glee from whatever gossip she20can acquire.She, however, shows us another side. She shows us doubt. What does she, though, have doubts about? I do not know. That is one of the enigmas of the film and that is what the viewer must weigh. Does she doubt her own possibly false consequential accusations against Father Flynn or does she have her OWN personal doubts about her faith, the church and the existence of God. When she puts up ""any old pope"" on the blackboard despite the fact that it is not the right one she says oh who cares you just want to use it as a reflective mirror to watch the kids and ""make them think you have eyes on the back of your head."" This is not exactly what one would expect from one who is supposed to love the church and its hierarchy. She is really quite cynical about church hierarchy and knows how the power game is played. She is shrewd and smart as she lies to Father Flynn about her knowledge of his allegedly sordid past in other parishes. She has none but she told him she did. He never questions it. Why would an innocent man not question that? More room for doubt this time of Father Flynn's innocence. We never really do know if he is truly innocent even though I rooted for him to be so.The once innocent Sister James says she now never sleeps. I have no doubt that she does not. Sister Aloysius cries with doubt at the end. Why? I do not know. I have my ow n doubts. This film is about good and about evil, truth and lies and shades of gray. It is above all , I think, about doubt of all that we are and all that we know. There is no doubt in MY mind that ""Doubt"" is a film not to be missed.",Doubt
188,UncleTantra,The body language of Doubt,10,21 January 2009,"The morning after seeing it, I am still pondering Meryl Streep's powerful performance in ""Doubt."" Painful to watch, much about it is liberating to ponder afterwards.Meryl Streep has always been a very physical actress. She is very, very, conscious of how ""body language"" conveys more than the delivery of lines or emotional ""internal dialog"" does. I remember a scene in ""Falling In Love"" in which her character, a married woman ringing the doorbell of the married man she is about to have an affair with, is waiting for him to answer the doorbell. She is standing with her back to us. *How* do you, as an actress, convey the inner turmoil and indecision that is part of being about to cheat on your husband, with your back turned to the audience, and with no lines to deliver? Meryl Streep put her hands behind her back and stood there wringing them together. A passerby on the street, seeing this, would have known that there was something *going on* for this woman, much less those of us in the theater audience.""Doubt"" is very much a film about physical acting. To some extent, this is out of necessity, because most of the scenes take place in a monastic setting in which shoot-em-ups and histrionics and over-the-top emotion would not ""ring true."" So the actors convey what is going on in their lives -- and what those lives have *made them* -- through their body language.Philip Seymour Hoffman's body language ""speaks"" of a man who has his sins and his weaknesses, but who has somehow managed to understand love and enjoyment of life and the joy of trying to help people enough that his body language is ""light."" He's a big guy, but he moves lightly for the most part, and his body language ""speaks"" of having to some extent left his sins back in the confessional. Amy Adams' body language ""speaks"" of hope and the joy of ""new faith,"" before it has been worn down by the world, and the doubts that the world (and the servants of doubt) implant in her.But Meryl Streep's body language just *hurts* when you look at it. Her body is a canvas upon which the ravages of doubt and judgmentalism and hatred and certainty have painted a landscape of horror. I'll have to watch the movie again to be sure, but I'm not sure she smiles once in the film. But even if her lips do, her body doesn't. Her face and her body are the ""templates"" for what doubt and judgmentalism and spiritual certainty *DO* to a person who indulges in them for a lifetime.Over the course of the film, as Sister Beauvier wreaks her revenge (for what, we're really never sure) on those around her, we even occasionally see a ""transfer"" of this horrific body language. A child whose body language is the personification of joy and innocence and light hears the words, ""Go to the Principal's office, right now,"" and that child's body language changes into the language of fear and the absence of light. Priests and nuns who cross her also receive the same ""transmission"" from Sister Beauvier, and we can see *their* body language change as they become less than they were a few moments before.It's really a remarkable performance, and has taught me a lot. About the ""sameness"" of life within cloistered walls, no matter what the spiritual ""flavor"" of the cloister might be. About what doubt and vindictiveness and certainty about the accuracy of one's own spiritual vision can DO to a person over time, both spiritually and physically. And about the alternative, and what the body language of people who have chosen to favor compassion over judgmentalism ""looks like,"" and ""feels like,"" out in the theater audience.The fascinating thing about this film from my point of view is that it doesn't leave us feeling that we ""know the truth"" about the situation at the heart of it. The ""facts"" are never quite clear.But we see at least one character on screen who has never had the slightest doubt that she knew the facts. Her *certainty* drives her from start to finish, and allows her to justify almost *anything* in the perseverance of ""being right"" and the pursuit of her self-appointed role of being the person who ""rights wrongs."" She KNOWS what is wrong and what is right, and what she has to DO about the things she KNOWS are wrong.And on screen, we see in Meryl Streep's body language what that ""knowing"" has done to her.I think it's an important spiritual lesson.",Doubt

It is, however, an indictment on subjective reasoning.Streep's character is challenged by individuals who personify this: the priest, the mother, and the teacher. She uncompromisingly confronts all three and eventually triumphs, but with a devastatingly heavy cost to her faith.The question is not whether the priest is guilty or not. In the end it is obvious. But rather, is what he did a misdemeanor or a felony? Do his liberties outweigh his positive influence on children? These questions are neatly hidden within the story, but are reflected in the priest's rationale in dealing with his unhappy conscience.Another clue to his guilt is in his argument that love overrides virtue. Whatever kind of love he is talking about is inconsequential since virtue is characteristic in defining the nobler aspects of love. Carnal love, however, has little to do with virtue. Considering the subject matter, the film is illuminatingly objective, apparently not influenced by political correctness.

The film, adapted from a stage play, deals with big themes like the nature of truth, sexual identity, and the still relevant theme of abuse of power within the church. With its question of whether or not a priest is abusing his position of power, the movie has infinite dramatic potential. But the movie is also heavy handed and underlines its themes repeatedly, over emphasizing its core questions so those in the cheap seats don't miss them. The film is indeed about Doubt. And Sin. And Guilt. And just in case you missed it, the movie repeats the word ""doubt"" at several crucial points throughout. See this is a movie about Doubt and each character struggles with doubt and the dramatic climax arrives when several characters finally confront their own doubts. And perhaps I would be more willing to forgive the film its heavy hand if the final exchange did not ring so false and end with yet another repetition of the word doubt. Meryl Streep delivers these final lines and it seems without this final thematic overkill, the film might have arrived at a more satisfying conclusion. ""Doubt"" falls apart in the final moments and reveals what a machine the entire enterprise actually was. The central story is merely a means to give actors a chance to have important, heated conversations about meaty themes. ""Doubt"", the film at least, is about the actors.

194,Dorjee_Wang,Moving piece of work,9,2 November 2016,"Based on the eponymous novel by John Patrick Shanley, ""Doubt"" is a powerful piece of work which takes full advantage of its ensembles' abilities. The movie deals with themes like doubt, conformity, and morality, and it does it ever so strongly. Packed with emotions, the movie is entirely character driven. Set in the 1960s, the film centres around Sister Aloysius (played by Streep), a strong, bold, intimidating principal of a local parish in the Bronx and Father Flynn (played by Hoffman) a jolly and amicable priest of the same parish.When Sister Aloysius doubts the priest might have had made inappropriate advances on a black kid, she starts taking a strong stance against him and goes to large extent to make him resign from the parish. ""In the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God"" she says to one of the other nun Sister James (played by Adams) while trying to prove the Father's wrongdoing, whilst he defends himself without hesitation. The film progresses through dialogues rather than events, due to this there is doubt that the film is not everyone's cup of tea. While the screenplay is not perfect by itself, it does its thematic topics a lot of justice and is executed with such brilliance, you can't help but be riveted through the entirety of the film. The final scene with Adams and Streep does much for the film as it aptly wraps up the movie with ambiguity and ""doubt"".But what sets apart this movie from the bunch is its actors. Streep plays the stoic nun very well, yet she delivers a touch of vulnerability which elevates the role to magnificence. But she's not without competition here, as Hoffman portrays the jovial priest with equal brilliance. There is a tête-à-tête between the two characters in the second half of the movie, the scene while simple is very gripping and ruthless due to the acting capabilities of the two leads I could not help but compare it as a showdown between the two acting giants. The movie also makes a smart use of Adams' doe eyed exterior as she plays the naive nun as if the role was made for her. Davis also appears as the mother of the troubled black kid, and while her role is short it leaves a strong imprint.As a caveat, the movie's not technically perfect and there is some narrative redundancy it'll still be one of the best acted movie of 2008. 9/10",Doubt

I read some encouraging reviews, and as the movie started Meryl Streep took me back to my teacher, Sister J. . As Streep wandered the aisles of Church and school, I said to myself, ""Yes, this is an accurate scene. This is just how it happened."" However, what was the purpose of this movie, and what is it's message? This is where I am deflated, let down and discouraged. I thought perhaps that the writers don't really have the insight into the real world of the Catholic Church just the periphery. Sure, recent years have uncovered a plethora of pedophiles, and if more was said of the movie in this, perhaps maybe the better, but little was said, just inferred. It seems that the message of this movie is it's title, and as the not so good Father tells us in the opening sermon, we can all find unity in having the same flaw. WHAT!!!??? This is a secular pile of dung. If priests and nuns wrote this movie they would write and act of doubt's antithesis, the all important credo in unity, which is Faith. Now, writers and audience alike may criticize my viewpoint, saying it is I who don't understand, but that is what I think is all wrong...with the world viewpoint and with this movie. I hate to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but the end says it all. In the end, Streep becomes a bad person. The movie tells us Father Flynn's next residence is larger and therefore puts more boys at greater risk, not to mention that Streep.... Well, I don't have to tell you if you want to watch it.I have another problem with the movie as to how it handled the Miller boy. The movie let's us believe one thing, but the boy never shows any signs of being of a certain orientation, only the word of his mother in close conversation. Was the movie's point that gay boys attract the pedophiles? That whole line was confusing, and arguably underdeveloped. Point is if you're going to divulge the conversation with the Mother than something more has to be done with the subject matter, even if it's closed off quickly.I can't recommend this movie except for the individual performances of Adams, Seymour and Streep (order by alpha or ind. rating, take your pick). They were all fantastic. I just wish they had a better script with which to work.",Doubt
198,mrvirgo,Hollywood Continues Its Catholic Bashing,1,16 December 2008,"No doubt about it. This movie stinks. There was no reason to use the Catholic Church to express the theme of this drama, but the liberal Illuminati that run the movie industry have yet to miss a chance to bash Catholics or Mormons. Until they reduce American to a spiritually dead place--like Europe--they won't stop. Happily,I didn't pay to see this movie. It stinks for a lot of reasons.1. Merle over plays Sister Alyosius to the point of creating a cardboard stereotype. She does her usual accent stick which is becoming a bit boring and adds nothing to her character.2. There is a deliberate and obvious attempt to make her character a villain.3. The writers go overboard in creating a contrast between the sister and the priest. An example is when the two groups are having dinner. The nuns are eating in total silence and the priests are enjoying a raucous meal. Nuns with moral standard=bad priests=rule benders and friends to minority students (i.e. bleeding heart liberals) good.4. The dumbest part of the movie is the end. After getting the father transferred, Sister Alyosius blurts out she never was sure of her accusations. Oh, come on! The whole plot depends on her being an absolutist versus father who practices moral equivalence. Hence the movie comes apart in the final scene.5. It's not clear why Father Flynn doesn't fight back against the child molesting charges. Is he really guilty? The viewer is not left with any clear clues so it's perplexing to say the least.6. The relationship between the principal and the nun who teaches there is bogus. As her superior, Sister Alyosius would not have been so chummy with Sister James. No garden tete-a-tetes or stunning confessions would have happened between them due to their difference in status.7. And as a bow to the gays the black student may be homosexual. Good grief, they writers needed that to create sympathy? I'm surprised they didn't put him in a wheel chair as well.Save your money. Don't see this rubbish no matter how many meaningless awards the industry insiders give it. That alone should be a clue that this is a propaganda project like so much that is being cranked out these days.",Doubt
199,paq5528,Excellent film -- but keep it light!,8,6 March 2009,"OK, the film deals with an issue of great moral consequence and really shouldn't be taken ""lightly"", but reading some of the other comments, I think people are looking too deeply into the film for some hidden meaning.Why did the blond boy smoke the cigarette? Because he could! It validated what Sister A said about him earlier, that he would try to get away with things. Remember the scene in the classroom with the reflection in the picture? It was simply to show that Sister James was becoming more like Sister A, and Sister A was not always wrong.However, it's a huge jump from classroom tricks to accusing someone of such impropriety. The ""luxury"" many of the reviewers have in watching this film is in not understanding the complete hatred of gays in the early 60's and the discrimination of being both black and gay in such a society.Did leaving his post prove that the priest was guilty? Absolutely not! As he said in his sermon, it matters not whether the allegation is true or not, once the feathers have left the pillow, they are impossible to collect and put back in. The damage is done! Again, as sermonized, moral certainty brings with it a comfort. But so does doubt. It is something we share. We do not KNOW that god exists, we do not KNOW many things. But the things we do not know unite us and make it a shared journey. Father Flynn could not both spare himself and the child(ren) in his care, so he ""sacrificed"" himself to moving again. Sister A sacrificed her faith and her vows for her ""certainty"" in another's wrong-doing.Wouldn't it have been better to cherish the shared doubt, than press on with the moral ""certainty""? We see at the end that Sister A has paid the price...",Doubt

The performances of all 3 major characters in the movie make it one of the most smoothly paced movies of the year. The screenplay is very much like those you get in classics from 50s and 60s. Hoffman and Streep are always a pleasure to watch and here also their clashes were simply great. Sister Veronica's character has also been played to its best possible by Amy Adams which is a pleasant surprise that we still have good talent coming into Hollywood.

202,grantbullert,Streep and Hoffman Are Incredible,8,23 April 2019,"""Doubt"" is a film that demands the audience to consider what they know, and what they think they know. It is storytelling done beautifully and is without a doubt a great film.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The way in which the story is told is absolutely brilliant. We, just like the characters, are not given all the information. We only have the words of the characters to go off of. We are not sure who to trust, or who is right. Director John Patrick Shanley masterfully toys with our trust and emotions. *Cinematography/Editing: Roger Deakins creates wonderful images and turns the world on it's side with his framing, but this is far from his best work. The editing is powerful; keeping the pace right where it needs to be and withholding just enough information from us. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue is incredibly powerful and captivating. Each character draws us in with their wit and intellect. Performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Meryl Streep make this film a work of art. Amy Adams and Viola Davis give strong performances as well. *Music/Sound: The score is not boastful at all, but rather plays its role by heightening our emotions. The sound design is brilliant, using silence as a way to heighten tension during many scenes. *Production Design/Special Effects: Realistic sets and costumes adds to the overall aesthetic of the film, but nothing out of the ordinary or terribly remarkable.*Conclusion: ""Doubt"" wonderfully examines fact and fiction in a place where it makes all the difference. There are no easy answers, but plenty of good questions.",Doubt
203,clg238,Four Brilliant Performances,10,28 January 2009,"There are four powerful reasons to see this film besides Shanley's excellent script. The four top performers (who have all been nominated for Academy Awards) are worth seeing and seeing again. On the second viewing, I was just as riveted. Seeing DOUBT again, I picked up on some doubles entendres, e.g., the Father's remark about the window and the need to let light in. From the very first second it appears on screen, Streep's face makes us privy to the inner workings of her character. She is not a one-dimensional character (""the dragon"" as she is called); there is no doubt as to her commitment to what she is doing and her willingness to aid those whom she considers her allies in the mission. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives us a very fine performance (if not his all-time best). Amy Adams makes us believe, even when, on reflection, her character is not totally believable. In a very few minutes, Viola Davis gives us the single most powerful scene in the entire film; some of this is due to Shanley's brilliance but the rest is due to her conveying a complexity we could not have imagined.",Doubt

And at the very end she's used as some device to show how everyone is human and fragile and full of doubt regardless of the tough exterior.It just wasn't believable. It was the typical cheesy Hollywood ending.",Doubt
205,paloma54,"Great film, if a bit unsatisfying.",8,7 March 2012,"Superb acting performances from Streep, Hoffman, Adams, Davis! The slightly unsatisfying ending could have been avoided by further comments from Sister Aloysius as to what exactly did she doubt. I can see by other commenters that each viewer has simply assumed that these doubts were the same ones shared by the viewer. This is pretty cheap, as it avoids elucidating her character. Is she doubting the value of what she is doing? Is the doubting her faith? Is she doubting her decision to lie? Is she doubting her ""decision"" that Father Flynn is guilty? It would have been helpful to know. Instead, the film refuses to make any point.What I loved about the characters were the mix of good and bad in each one. Sister Aloysius, despite her stern austerity, is not devoid of empathy or kindness, as we can see in her tender attention to the elderly nuns. She is not unkind to Sister James, even though it is obvious she thinks Sister James is too ""soft"". And she is fairly honest about herself. Sister James' character seems to recognize during the course of the film, that she can learn a few things from Sister Aloysius. So, we see her evaluating what is good and maybe not so good about her boss. This is what we all do, generally, or should do, attempt to find the good from those around us and provide grace around those areas of which we don't approve.And Father Flynn. He strikes me as a good, decent, compassionate guy, but leaves himself open with his quirkiness over his fingernails. Perhaps it is something as minor as this which causes the prejudice against him taken by Sister Aloysius. I gathered that we are not supposed to think he is guilty, but that we see the harm of malicious gossip, without any objective foundation, into which human beings are prone to lapse. And, there is the spiritual temptation provided by an ignoble desire to think the worst of others, and to revel in someone else's downfall. Viola Davis gives a wonderful short performance as an embattled mother.Although this doesn't really bear on the film, I couldn't help noticing that the sermons by Father Flynn are always his opinions about this or that, and do not provide even one single scriptural reference. The emptiness of such sermons is a perfect illustration of why so many Christians found nothing of value in ""church"" and drifted away. The priest is supposed to expound God's word to us, that we may be inspired by IT, and not by the priest's own personal opinions.",Doubt

But the single most powerful scene for me was the single scene in which Viola Davis appears--for which she got a Best Supporting Actress nomination, along with Adams.

It is a travesty--and an indication of the shallowness of the people who vote for the Academy Awards--that Doubt did not get a single Oscar for the 5 nominations it received.",Doubt
207,Anaslair,Do you doubt?,9,26 February 2017,"Doubt was at the same time brilliant and exasperating.There isn't much I can say about this movie without spoiling it. I believe I have never watched a movie that featured such ambiguous dialogues, which for me was at the same time genius and nerve- wrecking. It was a very powerful movie and there were scenes when the characters never said a word but you could feel a range of emotions coming through the screen. At times, the tension was palpable.I am still trying to process it all. It is a solid film with impressive interpretations, a controversial main theme but so much richer than that, as it confronts the spectator with several serious issues to which you may never get a right or wrong answer.In the midst of it all, I think I found Viola Davis' character the most shocking and emotionally packed. Both Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman blew me away with their performances throughout the entire film, and the way they played their characters was brilliant, particularly Streep's. Sister Aloysius sure goes through a troubling development. However, Davis as the altar boy's mother, in perhaps five minutes in the entire movie, was something completely out of any league, so disturbing and heartbreaking, and she was so freaking good.I hope you will watch Doubt as it really is an excellent movie, but please know you may be disappointed in the ending.

The movie intelligently portrayed a issue of trust in even the most faithful believers to the church, which made it so hard to make a decision. I thought Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves an award for his brilliant acting in this film, he is what made the movie so enticing.

The trailers were of course a jumble of scenes which gave some idea of what the film was about. While watching I had the feeling I was watching a play. I don't have that feeling very often. Typical Hollywood fare is highly predictable, littered with lame humour and the obligatory fireball explosions even where orange flame wouldn't be right. But this isn't the typical, this is a serious production on a serious subject, but still felt predictable in some unfathomable way.Strong performances by Meryl Streep, Philip S. Hoffman and Amy Adams, but I felt the real standout was Viola Davis as Donald's mother. I'm feeling Hoffman is being overused as he has been in several films I have seen in the past two years so the illusion of him as a priest isn't quite working.After seeing the film I was informed it was indeed adapted from a play. Hmm. So why in the adaptation doesn't it lose the feel? All in all it was an interesting film about a world, an Inner City Catholic School unlike that which I was raised in and was perhaps unintentionally informative.

First, this is a nicely written, wonderfully acted movie. Alas, it looks like Mr. Shanley felt that the film version needed more oomph than the stage version. I say this because we get crooked camera angles, a lot of those super slow zooms and dramatic last lines before the cut to a new scene (Sample: when one of the employees at the school shows how the new cat caught a mouse and says triumphantly, ""See? It takes a cat!"" Sister Aloysius says - almost twirling her mustache - ""It certainly does."" I mean, good grief, the employee's comment was already heavy-handed enough: we got it... we GOT it).Ebert is sure right in saying that Viola Davis is wonderful and is the heart of the movie. Aside from the fact that Ms. Davis does a great job, I think the secret lies also in the fact that hers are emotions that we almost embrace, knowing them to be real - unlike the rest of the characters, whose feelings and motives we doubt.All in all, a good movie that could've been great.",Doubt

This film really does just keep firing outstanding perofrmances scene by scene at you and not for one second does it do anything to make you wont to stop watching! It keeps you gripped it starts off slow getting you used to characters ""the way things are"" and then all because of one incident one moment of doubt one possible misunderstanding a whole twisted and indecent idea/truth is unleashed upon the church and those involved.The film does so many things well it's hard to mention them all. Hoffmans character so easily makes you believe he is Innocent and streeps character so easily makes you believe there is something very wrong happening. You really don't know what to think you can't make up your own mind! Father Flyn comes across as a caring and extremely compassionate man who is living in the real world and treats others with kindness and love as god intended.Now sister Aloysius is the opposite she takes a tough as nails approach she punishes the children majorley and believes being strict and firm will teach them the ""way"" and is what god intended.Sister Aloysius does not like that Father Flyn treats the children well , sympathises with others and has a more modern approach to the church and the teachings. So straight away you feel as if it is an attempt to get rid of Father Flyn but as put before both sides make you believe and are extremely convincing.The only things in my opinion that could have made the movie better was a different ending. I really didn't think a lot of the ending of this i felt i needed the film to tell me more than it was telling.Also it was one of the few times i'll ever say this but it maybe needed abit more almost over acting it needed to push the boat out at times and get really heavy on your ass but it just didn't., Although some scenes were extremely amazing and gripping that must be said.

216,gooelf50,I still have doubts,8,24 March 2012,"This was the most unsettling movie I have seen in many years. Throughout the showing I found myself wandering back and forth between condemnation of the Priest's behaviour, the Principal's behaviour and the behaviour of the young black student's Mother. The part of the traditional nun who is principal of a Catholic School is played perfectly by Meryl Streep. She's unhappy with change and views it almost as a loss of the comfort and peace of mind that comes with tradition. The part of the new Priest is played just as perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He views change in the way religion is practiced as absolutely essential and wants to see the iron fisted traditional rule of the principal disappear into the dark, inflexible past where it belongs. Thus, from the beginning of the movie there is a silent war between the two main characters. If you are a trusting and positive person, you may find yourself believing that the new priest is a wonderful man who cares about nothing more than the religious health and happiness of the parishioners and young students of his church. The affection that he displays for the troubled young black student at the centre of the controversy is touching and absolutely appropriate. On the other hand, if you are a more cynical person, likely to be suspicious of any behaviour that strays from the reserved understanding that a priest traditionally expresses in a more sombre way to his parishioners and students, then you may quickly decide that he is all of the things that the principal suspects him to be. In the end, the principal wins out and succeeds in driving the new priest out of the parish. He moves on to another parish where he has greater responsibilities and enjoys a higher level of professional respect. But I, the viewer, am left wondering if the principal is a paranoid cast back to 17th century religious practices, who victimizes a new priest simply because he represented change that she wasn't prepared to accept, or if the new Priest actually is an abuser who took advantage of a young vulnerable boy who had no one to turn to for comfort, but was ferreted out by a wise, no nonsense adherent to purity in religion.",Doubt

The shot selection of Roger Deakins is terrific, along with a knuckle-whitening score from Howard Shore. The film's harrowing, dark tone is played brilliantly by John Patrick Shanley, who not only holds nothing back in terms of intensity, but uses symbolism to perfection in more ways than thought possible. It's not for the faint of heart; it's a brutal study of corruption, bias, and of course, doubt, which is incredibly intense and does not let up, which in itself is a testament to the incredible job done by Shanley.

218,jwardww,Our Divine Dissembler,9,7 January 2013,"In case you have any doubt who our finest actress is, a viewing of Doubt will set you straight. How could Meryl Streep, a Presbyterian Yalie, portray so flawlessly a Bronx nun with a rich accent tempered by propriety? There are not many actresses with the skill to do something that specific, let alone do it so well. One can only imagine the hard work went into her preparation for this performance. I happened to be educated early on by nuns who had the same provenance, accent and deliriously self-righteous personality quirks as those brought to life in Streep's virtuosic performance; and I am happy to report her portrayal is accurate. That is probably the case in all her work. When she commits to a role, the character is examined objectively and forensically without condescension or contempt. It's a total delight. That being said, I must add that I think she has only begun to fulfill her potential as an actress. Of course, at this time, no director, producer or agent is likely to be inclined to meddle with her process on the set. I should think they'd be intimidated. However, as a member of the hoi polloi, I have a purely subjective suggestion for her. In order to join the pantheon of film legends, she might begin to focus on the effect a role will have on her audience and make that effect part of her goal. What does she want us to feel, as well as see. Her limning skills are unparalleled, but for the audience to have an emotional response, specific goals should be established, along with her technique to achieve them. I think she might then rise to the level of a John Barrymore or Marie Dressler who—whatever the character—were not only able to dissemble, but to devastate.",Doubt

There is no innocent until proven guilty and she commits mortals sins along the way just because of what she believes to be true. It is quite like the priest saw through her enough to understand that she could damage his reputation beyond repair with no way to disprove her allegations even by telling the truth since she outright accuses him of lying. If anyone has displayed immoral unethical behavior it is the principle. I wish to have my almost 2 hours back. I pray you never watch this..

220,DavidTL,Doubt and Dilemmas,9,13 December 2014,"Doubt perfectly deals with major issues. The film, like the title suggests keeps you constantly in doubt as a nun (Meryl Streep) suspects a priest (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) of molesting an altar boy.She, as a woman in 1964 works by herself to try and reveal the truth, due to the over-powering of men which she knows will be on his side. She has a high job as a principal in the school, and the young students fear her strictness. She has her 'right ways' for doing things. Using traditional hymns instead of radio 'christmas tunes' which Father Flynn wants for the Christmas sermon. She is even against the use of ink pens and sugar, which Flynn also uses and has in his cup of tea, three in fact. Sister Aloysius uses these to draw her suspicions to the truth in her mind.She gains the suspicions from a sermon Father Flynn has, and wonders what relevance does it really have if not about a feeling he has himself. She asks Sister James (Amy Adams) to keep an eye out for suspicious actives, but due to James' own naivety doesn't report anything until a week later after Aloysius fears an incident would have already happened.The film deals with large issues in a not-so on the nose way. Such as the overpower of men over women, and also struggling black families and parents wanting the best for their child. Sister Aloysius wants Flynn out of the parish due to her high suspicion and her own 'truth' that Flynn is a paedophile, and singles out the one black boy in the school as he would be the 'special' one. Flynn on the other hand says he is helping the boy, Donald, and no foul play has occurred except for the fact that Donald took altar wine, which Aloysius believes he actually gave him.We are in constant doubt as to who's side to be on. The sister or the father. Children should be protect in schools, and also if need be helped by a tutor. Especially one, such as in 1964 which is the only one in the school of a different skin-colour. After the sister approaches Donald's mother, she say it is ""only until June"" and suggests that it will not be her son's fault and hints he may be homosexual. She wants the best for her son. She wants him to go to the best school, get the best grades and get into college. And she in her own way does not care that there is a possibility of her son being molested due to she does not want her husband to find out to beat her son again. She is in a dilemma of protecting her child from wrongdoings or doing what is best for him in life. Because she cannot do both, due to the colour of their skin, and also her abusive husband and challenges that arises due to racism.The film ends with Flynn leaving the school and at his leaving sermon he says goodbye to each individual person in the congregation. Donald cries, while another boy smiles. What was this about? The film never showed any dislike of Flynn from his boy before. Was this due to Father Flynn coming onto this boy as well as Donald? We will never know. Even sister Aloysius is in high doubt at the end, and annoyed that Flynn gets a promotion at another parish.The film is very character driven, and has dialogue heavy scenes which are all wonderfully acted by the entire cast. Each of them deserved those Oscar nominations, if not all should have won. The visual direction and hints are great, such as the heavy wind which can be linked to Father Flynn's ""gossip"" sermon, which was about a woman who confesses to the church that she had a dream that God was pointing a finger at her, and due to her gossipping. The father of her church tells her to go onto her roof and cut open a pillow then come back and tell him what happened. She said feathers. He tells her to go and collect every one, and she replies she cannot due to the wind taking them everywhere. He replies that THAT is gossip, and how fast it can travel. Back to the actual wind that occurs in the film, I feel this heavy weather reflects back on the intensity of the ""Did he do it? Did her not?"". We will never know, but we are stuck with the dilemma, such as his own mother to should he be protected from evils in the world, or comforted to have a good future?Roger Deakins cinematography is great once again, but one thing that I felt was off was the use of his dutch tilts in the film, that I felt did not convey or progress any more emotion in the film that was already there. They felt forced, and strange in this drama. One use of editing and his work which I quite enjoyed was a shot of Aloysius looking down, with the camera looking up at her, her powerfulness. Then it cut to a shot of Flynn in another location, looking down on him as he walks. He looks up and we see where the camera was. A window with an eye on it. She is keeping close eyes on him, and will over-power him.",Doubt

Shanley constructs a story of a minister accused of wrong doing and the sister hell-bent on proving it. The story is so evenly balanced that it never becomes clear whether he has done anything or not. Things are suspicious, but nothing is clear, building doubt in the audiences' mind (both for the minister and for the nun). Only in the end is the answer revealed, and even then, it is not clear, doubt abounds. And to top off such an interesting concept are the riveting performances by Streep, Hoffman, Adams and Davis. Together they make an already mesmerizing experience into something unforgettable. This is a must see.",Doubt
222,nyc man,A very good movie to think about and see a slice of life,8,18 July 2010,"Although ""Doubt"" suffers from being too much like a play, it is a fine film, with complexity and depth.********Spoiler Alert******** I think the role of the black child who is beaten up for being gay, and sees the priest as a positive figure (which he is) and wants to become a priest (sad, but often true in life), is reflected upon our knowledge, some 40 years after the events, that the Catholic Church is full of child molesting priests, who get away with it for decades and upon tens if not hundreds of kids, whether they be gay or straight.Child abuse is serious, and the Meryl Streep character recognizes it. But, she also recognizes in that profoundly Catholic thinking, that writing with a ball point pen (which is the slippery slope to bad penmanship) and belief in magic (""Frosty the Snowman"") are also evils, since the latter has a magic hat. How many fundamentalists hate the Harry Potter movie for its magic, which I personally find enchanting (pun intended?).It's a good movie, and I appreciate the Doubt that it instills even upon an astute reviewer such as myself. In my opinion, the priest is gay and probably knows the kid would have sex with him, but chooses not to do so, out of compassion for the hard life of the kid, and perhaps for being chaste as his oath requires of him. Whether the priest has sex with adults, well, that may be another story.And the mom is a bit scary. She is willing to let the child have sex with his mentor, basically since the benefits far outweigh the damages. I know it's shocking for America to face it, but I've known more than 1 boy who liked older men and willingly had sex with them, and would do it again if they had magically re-lived their life. A story of a kid and his track coach in the shower in Junior High come to mind. The kid later grew up as a well-adjusted gay guy, and felt the story was hot (it was, as others I told that to agreed) and the kid (now adult) looked back on that with nostalgia and pride.As for Sister James, who amazingly or not so amazingly is drawn from real life, she is a paragon of a good nun and a naive, but real person. Sometime naivety is a blessing. ""'Tis the Gift to be simple""It saddens me that Sister James starts aping Sister Aloysius, and it only takes a few changes to profoundly affect the children, one of whom cries. I think Sister James is the strength that is the Catholic Church, open, trusting, reflective, strong, caring and deliberate. Some of the other nuns have a simplicity perhaps borne of simple minds, or of Alzheimer's, but even they have a strength beyond mine to accept blindness and spartan accommodations, which quite literally contrasts with the lives of the smoking, drinking, laughing priests. Sister James' simplicity is one of choice and deliberation, and seems like goodness personified -- even if she can be led ""astray"" by Meryl Streep's strong character. **********Spoiler Alert************But the ending is sublime, for it shows that even the bad (inflexible, actually) Sister Aloysius has doubts, and is thoughtful. And for that, I feel she has been redeemed. For as Goethe said in rescuing Faust from the Devil: ""Wer immer strebend sich bemüht, Den können wir erlösen"" (my translation:) Whoever continuously strives, We shall redeem them.

Cold weather. Cold northeastern winter weather. The kind that blows across your path, knocks down limbs in your way, obscures your vision and maybe makes you see things that aren't there. The kind of hard wind that blows away the fine line dividing right and righteous, wrong and wronged. The kind of cold Meryl Streep exposes as Viola Davies offers up her son to the bare bones of stark truths. Just as Shanley did with the play, none of the other actors know if Father Flynn is guilty. Yet, the Spartan dialog gives these accomplished angels their wings. Doubt floats with the power of their performances. Nary is a word wasted.

224,jack-964,pg-40,8,23 January 2009,"Doubt is a movie about moral (good and bad) and takes place in the early sixties in a somewhat cliché setting considering the problem it hints on; pedophilia.There is nothing wrong with this movie. The story is good and it is told well, technically and artistically. The pace may seem a bit slow, but considering the setting it is correct.The actual topic i think is not the pedophilia it hints on, but the moral change in a changing world. The whole story spins around the 2 lead characters that do not agree. Streep plays a seemingly cold hearted, pragmatic woman that finds her safety in conservatism vs her male opponent that is in favor of change and interprets love in a rather unconventional (?) manner. All this in the setting of Christianity, thus questioning the very basis of this religion.You are slowly taken into this big question (if u are open to it), leading to an 'open end' I was particularly taken by this end scene, where Streep suddenly breaks the continuity of her character and emotionally proposes the final statements, which feel more like a question that you have to answer. It is a bit strange that the movie makes this turn here, at the end. But i like it!The complexity of the moral angles plus the setting it is in, make me think this movie will not be understood easily by youngsters, so i gave it a PG-40",Doubt

To call me a ""fan"" of this woman, would be like saying that Tiger Woods plays Golf. There are not enough superlatives to express my admiration for Meryl Streep.The film is a modest effort, and the story is somewhat loose and uneven. The performances are, however spectacular. Meryl Streep just hammers it home. She has no proof of any alleged improper behaviour by the priest, but her moral certainty and rage is almost like a female George C.

Recently the school had just accepted its first black student, and Father Flynn, and the principal, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep) quickly become concerned with the welfare of their new student. Sister Aloysius shares with Sister James (Amy Adams) and a few others that she has seen a few things lately that have made her suspicious. Soon after Sister Aloysius and Sister James begin to believe that Father Flynn is getting a little too close with the school's newest student, and Sister Aloysius will stop at nothing to find the truth.I have heard some people say that this film is too slow and boring for their taste, and that may be true for many people, because the climax of the story hardly gets above a heated debate between two people. But I actually enjoyed that about the movie. I thought the story was very interesting, and found myself really wanting to know how it was going to end. The script in my opinion was brilliant, which helped the story out, so I thought that part of the film worked out fine.However, the story was definitely not the strongest point of the movie. The acting was. These three actors, Mery Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams were absolutely unbelievable. I honestly thought that Meryl Streep deserved to win best actress. This movie being her 15th nomination, she really deserves to have won more than just twice. But Oscar or no Oscar she acted perfectly in this film. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams easily deserved their nominations as well.Overall, Doubt is slow at times, but it really makes you think, which not many movies do these days. It was brilliantly acted, and I thought was worthy of a best picture nomination.",Doubt

(Genesis 3:1, KJV) ""McCarthy was an asshole, but he was right about a lot of things."" (Ed Harris as Parcher in ""A Beautiful Mind"") what could be more morally repugnant than a person in an office of extraordinary trust robbing a child of his or her innocence of the dark side of adult sexual emotions? how about a disdainful father inflicting intolerance-fueled violence upon that child? what if the victim is a willing victim? are there ways of knowing truth that evade the norms of justice? true story: a half dozen firefighters were putting out what seemed to be a fire well under control inside a dwelling. suddenly the lead fireman, a long-time veteran, ordered everyone out. moments later, the floor collapsed into an inferno blazing below. asked later how he knew, he couldn't explain it himself. he had been around a long time, and he just knew.should someone's entire life's work be nullified and their career destroyed if their *alleged* heinousness hasn't been established to a moral certainty?Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) opens ""Doubt"" with an absolutely superb soliloquy delivered as a sermon from the pulpit of his working class Catholic congregation. he preaches that doubters are no less a community than believers. as such, they are not lost and alone, just as believers are not lost and alone within their community of belief. sitting in the back to insure her charges neither slouch nor whisper to one another, the parish-school principal, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), detects a whiff of ""smoke"". shortly later, she asks a starry-eyed young nun, Sister James (Amy Adams), just what doubts of his own might have inspired Father Flynn's sermon topic?eventually, a lot of smoke rises, but no flame can be proved. when Sister James expresses doubt that Father Flynn could be a moral monster, Sister Aloysius dismisses her naiveté. but, when Sister Aloysius informs Mrs Miller (Viola Davis) that Father Flynn is abusing her son Donald (Joseph Foster), it is Sister Aloysius who seems naive. in a gut-wrenching performance deserving of an Oscar, Viola Davis, burdened by handicaps of race, gender, and class beyond the ken of a white nun, tearfully explains that, all things considered, the current arrangement is Donald's only chance to get into college.the idealistic Sister James believes Father Flynn's dodgy explanations. the intolerant Sister Aloysius dryly remarks, ""you just want your simplicity back"". moral complexity and ambiguity are the tightly woven warp and woof of this superb film achievement. about the final scene: based upon many IMDb.com user comments, and even the (user-written) ""FAQ"", it seems many viewers of ""Doubt"" believe that in the final scene Sister Aloysius is expressing her own doubts about the guilt of Father Flynn. some commenters were angered and offended, asserting that writer/director John Patrick Shanley was casting doubt as to the guilt of pedophile priests generally. others felt it was a disappointing contrivance lacking conviction and credibility. this is an unfortunate misreading of the film. since ""Doubt"" was written at the height of the recent scandal, and since Shanley is no ""Sister James"" himself, he would not have intentionally cast doubt on Flynn's guilt. but, if it were his intent, he failed. his script makes clear beyond a reasonable doubt that Flynn is as guilty as OJ. to avoid adding more spoilers, i will just expand on the smoke/fire metaphor: there wasn't just ""smoke"" -- there were fire engines up and down the block, people screaming from windows, and someone running from the scene holding an empty gasoline bucket.instead, the final scene bookmarks the sermon that opens ""Doubt"". as already mentioned, it begins with Father Flynn's preaching that doubters are as much a community (and perhaps by implication, a communion) as those who unquestioningly believe in the Gospels, and the Catholic Church and its sacraments as the sole path to eternal salvation. Sister Aloysius, who seems to have never harbored a doubt about anything, self-righteously (even smugly) wonders: just what does Father Flynn have his doubts about? she has devoted her life as a widow-turned-nun to following the directives of the Church in the heretofore unshakable belief that this was the best way, indeed the only way, to guide all ""her children"" to salvation in the hereafter. however, from the beginning of ""Doubt"" Sister Aloysius has been experiencing the public face of Vatican II (still in session in 1964) as stepping onto the slippery slope toward secularism, or even paganism. by the end, she is seeing the Church's hierarchy as an old-boy network that protects its own, even its rottenest apples.in the final scene, Sister Aloysius bitterly reflects that this old-boy network has promoted an obvious ""arsonist"" to heading up an entire fire company. given her already dark view of the human condition, she probably has surmised that if the Church hierarchy is covering up for one pedophile, it's also covering up for others. therefore, her doubt is a *crisis-of-faith* (not reservations about the guilt of a slithery serpent such as Flynn).Shanley isn't questioning the guilt of pedophile priests, or the Church's complicity in their crimes. in fact, he's laying it out for all to see. instead, he's dramatizing how profoundly shaken this shocking moral and criminal horror left even the most faithful of believers. (special note to those reviewers who have caviled about Meryl Streep's interpretation of Sister Aloysius: Joan Crawford is supposed to have once said, ""if you want the girl-next-door, go next door."" by analogy, if you don't want to see Meryl Streep's interpretation of a larger-than-life ""dragon"" of a nun {Father Flynn's wry description of her from the outset}, then don't watch Meryl Streep.)",Doubt
228,griffinfinity,I have my Doubts...,3,5 July 2009,"This film opens with a view of a street scene from the sixties. We see the neighborhood and those who inhabit it, preparing for the daily parade to the center of the community, the Catholic Church. And that is as far as we are taken from church grounds. Without researching the production, I can be reasonably sure that it originated as a play. It is not so much what happens on these grounds that is the reason we are here, it is what might have occurred.This is a story-based film, and one that I was looking forward to. Philip Seymour Hoffman is an outstanding actor, and one of my favorites. Meryl Streep isn't but she is excellent in everything she chooses to be a part of. With story being the action, I didn't feel enough kick. It was too subdued. What we received packed little punch and was nothing more than an episode of 'Little House on the Prairie'. I say this because in the end it was always the moral of the story that was most important. And often times, that was left for the viewer to interpret. This is central to 'Doubt' as well.I loved the feel of the film, as I was raised in the sixties. Everything looked right and it brought back memories of a time when buildings had character, automobiles were distinct and the people who lived around you were not strangers. It is a period piece that succeeds exceedingly well on that level. And true to form, Meryl Streep is fantastic. I had thought that this took place in any one of the cities with a large Irish population But Ms. Streep has an unmistakable Boston accent (and perfect I might add).The Catholic Church in America is a once powerful entity that for a time was as influential as the government itself. But it began to crumble; as did the government when the truth was revealed to those whose support made the institutions possible. Lying beneath the surface was an ugly network of pathetically powerful men. A cabal based on power, greed, lust and deception. Demons who were meant to dwell in the final chapter of the book they used to advance their cause. There is little doubt where they are headed.",Doubt
229,wgg-1,"Meryl Streep channels Margaret Hamilton in ""Doubt.""",3,3 January 2009,"I saw John Patrick Shanley's ""Doubt"" on Broadway with Cherry Jones as Sister Aloysius and Bryan F. O'Byrne as Father Flynn. It was one of the most riveting afternoons of theater I have ever experienced: forceful and clean acting, minimalist staging, no sound effects (other than the gasps of the audience). Cherry Jones played the hawkish Sister without any notion of Catholic school stereotypes. The plot twists provided all the thunder and lightning necessary to keep the attention of an audience left exhausted by the emotional battle between Aloysius and Flynn, whom the Sister perceives as a threat within the faculty of the school where she is the principal.Shockingly Shanley has added all the clichés, including thunder and lightning, to his film of ""Doubt"" that he so effectively stripped from his play. In sabotaging his own play with stereotypes on screen, Shanley has found a ready ally in his lead actress, Ms. Streep, who lacks only the green warpaint for her depiction of Aloysius as the Wicked Witch of the West. She does wear the shiny black gown and requisite spiked hat. It would take only long fingernails to turn her into Margaret Hamilton, but those are reserved for co-star Phillip Seymour Hoffman who makes Flynn about as threatening as the morning milkman. With the exception of Amy Adams and Viola Davis to round out the central foursome of the play, the movie of ""Doubt"" bears no emotional resemblance to its vastly superior stage incarnation. By the time of the film's climax, so devastating as portrayed by Cherry Jones on Broadway, Streep has become such a cardboard cutout of the Catholic School nun that any suggestion of her personal redemption, or regret, is laughable. She even slaps the students with rulers as she purses her lips underneath that black cap.With maturation, Streep appears to be entering the arena of late-career overacting previously pioneered by Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, and Dustin Hoffman. Well, it works for the Motion Picture Academy. She will certainly score a nomination and probably win an Oscar for her hammy work in this anemic adaptation of a great theatrical entertainment. For some of us, Margaret Hamilton will remain the genuine witch to watch. And ""Doubt"" will linger in the memory as a great Broadway experience, shamelessly reduced to camp on screen.",Doubt

It's great. Wonderfully accompanied by shots of feathers floating through the streets. The director could have also left this to the imagination of the viewer which some might say would have been better but I really like this decision.I did think the motives of Streep's character could have been made more clear.

231,RisingStar12,How far would you go to protect the truth?,9,4 January 2009,"Doubt. It's something all of us will face in life. We doubt ourselves as people. We doubt our friends and what they mean to us. And, as this film shows, we doubt the truth, and whether or not we have gone too far to protect it. In case you are unaware of the plot of the story, ""Doubt"" takes place in 1964 in a Catholic (or a religion very close to Catholic) school. The priest Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is well-respected, giving convincing sermons, and is liked by all but one: Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep.) Sister Aloysius is a strict, old-fashioned nun. She detests the idea of upgrading anything, which includes ballpoint pens, sugar in tea, and Frosty the Snowman. Father Flynn, however, has the opposite view. One day Donald Miller, the only black student in the school, is called down to the rectory. When he comes back, his teacher Sister James (Amy Adams) finds him to be uneasy and somewhat troubled. When she hears about this, Sister Aloysius is convinced that Father Flynn has molested Donald. And from there the pressure builds up and up and up, until, somewhere in the middle, it explodes. And what comes out is one of the best films of the year. There are several remarkable elements to ""Doubt."" One of them is, of course, the acting. Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Viola Davis all make the movie shine. Another great thing is the writing. John Patrick Shanley can easily switch from humorous to intense without making the audience exhausted. It would be a shame if he does not at least get nominated for an Oscar for writing and directing. The atmosphere plays a large part in the story, and Shanley is able to capture it flawlessly. But perhaps the most outstanding thing about this film is how realistic it is. In this film, people get interrupted mid-sentence, people talk over each other, there are no ""big"" Hollywood lines of dialog that, once you hear, you know some big shot writer in Hollywood wrote in attempt to get an Oscar. There is no overly-dramatic music, there are no moments that seem out of place, the swearing, violence, and drinking are kept under control, and, most importantly, there is not a single moment when you are bored. So, in short, I'm only saying one thing: You must see this film. ---RisingStar12",Doubt

I have such doubts."" only that this time its guilt doubts.another interesting dialogue is the one where the Father said to Sister James ""There are people who go after your humanity, Sister, that tell you that the light in your heart is a weakness.

233,jack-115-853599,Poignant!!!!,10,22 August 2013,"As with all art forms, the perspective bought into the mix totally defines the impact. This was an excellent screen adaptation of the award-winning play by director, John Patrick Shanley which ultimately resulted in a uniquely liberating, somewhat painful, yet truly thought-provoking viewing experience. Kudos goes to the principal players, Meryl Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Viola Davis and Joseph Foster, all of whom gave wrenching award-worthy performances.The story is set in the mid-sixties, not long after the assassination of JFK. A Catholic school in the Bronx accepts its first black student, Donald Miller, beautifully portrayed by Joseph Foster. The priest, wonderfully realized by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, is truly empathetic and realizing what a struggle it must be for the student, keeps an eye on him to make sure he adjusts well to this new and very intricate situation. Because of his attention, one sister, a very effective Amy Adams, initially becomes slightly suspicious of his motives and, unfortunately, reports her suspicions to the principal, an exceedingly pedagogical nun, exquisitely played by Meryl Streep. She, of course, confronts the priest with her suspicions which he vehemently denies and she steadfastly refuses to believe. She even confronts the boy's mother, portrayed by Viola Davis who gives a wrenching performance. The encounter between these two is as taut and revealing as those between the accusing nun and the outraged priest. The overall dialogue is crisp, biting, poignant and positively riveting.Certain aspects of this whole scenario evoked poignant memories making it rather easy for me to relate to. Moreover, certain revelations the mother made to the nun re the boy's home life raised VERY serious questions. These questions will be at the focal point of any discussions about the play for the simple reason the author wisely neither confirmed nor denied those suspicions which, obviously, was pivotal to the whole theme. Any ""doubts"" you find yourself faced with while watching this further fuels the profound impact the film makes because in the final analysis, it will be up to the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions - as well it should be. The ending is little short of devastating.With such a riveting and important play being realized by a positively flawless cast, this could hardly miss. Just eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexcellent.

235,amitaishwaryajogi,"Great theater perhaps, not a Great Film",6,18 February 2009,"Great theatre doesn't necessarily make for great cinema. Doubt proves this. Despite brilliant all-round performances by a sterling cast- for instance, every time Meryl Streep looked into the camera and I mean really looked, that icy stare, something inside me froze, the temperature dropped and the air turned chilly- there were a couple of times when I found myself thinking 'when will all this end'. After all, the story doesn't really move, and all the action, so to speak, is intellectual. The expected duel between Hoffman and Streep never really materializes- with the former quietly slipping away. The central question of the film- can love be a sufficient justification for lust?- remains strangely unanswered. The film does little to influence the viewers' views; it ends up merely reinforcing them. (For me, the answer is No, and Doubt hasn't created any doubts in my mind about that.)The moment of catharsis, when it does finally come, arrives in the form of a dialogue that Ms. Streep's character has with Viola Davis, who plays the mother of the black boy she believes Hoffman's character has 'made advances at.' It's a short scene, but boy does it surprise! Both actresses hold no punches back: morality, it seems, has no place for a mother who only wants her child to get away from the world she has brought him into. There can be no certainty about things like that. Material is prized over the moral, giving way to a new unorthodox kind of morality. Wasn't that incidentally also the theme of Vatican-II being held at the same time as the events this film depicts? In the end, Doubt is all that remains. Still, if you are a student of acting, even an amateur one like I am, this film should not be missed. There can be no doubt about that, at least.",Doubt
236,hosolo,Film Doubt,7,23 April 2009,"The draw of this movie was based on all the Academy Award nominations it received (with help from Miramax, of course). In fact all the lead actors and director/screenwriter were in contention, but Doubt was shut out. It's the story of students in a parochial school run by Father Flynn (Hoffman) and an aggressively tough principal (Streep). The film slowly takes you to it's main plot, and at the end, it will leave you wondering, if the Sister did the right thing, hence the film's title. The actors are all good, in particular Streep, no surprise there, but some of the film sequences were bizarre, such as the wind blowing or the camera angle when Father Flynn and Sister James (Adams) are talking on park benches, as if the audience would recognize it's meaning.This film comes across like a stage play, and even though it is an adaptation of an actual play, it still feels like the story would be better told in a theater. There is no accompanying dramatic music, just actors and dialogue with ""cinematic"" effects. Nevertheless, ""Doubt"" is a compelling story, well acted but probably better staged.",Doubt

Meryl Streep elevates this movie to a super realm of societal commentary. This movie is interesting because it takes more or less ordinary situations and makes them so abstract that, while I say that it's commentary, it makes no judgments and hopes that the viewer doesn't either and hopes that the viewer simply appreciates it for what it is. This movie is a diamond in the rough of tedious movies. While this movie might make you think that it is tedious, watch the whole movie and just absorb because I guarantee that you will like it. I personally am not one for (seemingly) morose movies, but this movie comes from somewhere else. Great movie.",Doubt
238,sweetlittlepie,You can never be too certain,9,7 May 2009,"The film's title says it all, this is a film that fills us with doubt.The film takes place in 1964 and follows Sister Aloysius, the strict principal of a Catholic School in the Bronx. When Sister James (Amy Adams) informs her that Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the parish priest, called a student to the rectory alone she is convinced that Flynn has overstepped his boundaries. The student in question is Donald Miller, the only black student in the school.She confronts Flynn, who defends himself and after the confrontation Sister James thinks that Flynn is innocent, but Aloysius doesn't think so. She still firmly believes that Flynn has an inappropriate relationship with Donald Miller.Meanwhile Sister James after seeing Father Flynn embrace Donald warmly begins to have doubts about the priest's innocence.Aloysius tries everything to prove that Flynn is guilty even calling Donald Miller's mother, Mrs. Miller to the school to speak to her. In the film's quintessential scene Mrs. Miller tells the nun that Donald's father hits him, and does not express disgust or outrage when Aloysius speaks her suspicious of Flynn's indiscretions, which leads the elder woman to believe that Miller is not a very good mother. She coerces Mrs. Miller, like she coerces Sister James, into believing her.At the end of the film there is a confrontation between Aloysius and Flynn. Flynn looses the fight, but does not confess. At the end of the film Aloysius tearfully reveals to Sister James that she has doubts.After watching this movie your mind is racing, and if you're like me you are left with a somewhat uneasy feeling after watching the dubious ending. John Patrick Shanley does a great job as he adapts his award winning stage play into feature film. If anyone else had adapted his play, it just wouldn't be the same. Shanley knows these characters in and out, they are his characters and that's one of the reasons why the film works.Streep as always delivers a great performance. It's funny how someone like Streep can be in a fun musical like Mamma Mia!, and in a tension filled drama like Doubt in the same year. It just shows you that she is an actress filled with diversity. I believe she can play any character she wants to because she fully commits to her performance. Some say that her performance as Aloysius is a caricature and too over-the-top, but I believe that if you're going to play a character as cold, manipulative, and strict as Aloysius that you might as well do it right or not do it at all, and that's what Meryl Streep does, she fully commits to this role.Amy Adams is wonderful as the innocent young Sister James. We the audience are a lot like James because like her, we are caught in the middle of Flynn and Aloysius' battle and we don't really know who to believe. Viola Davis is a revelation as Mrs. Miller, she's probably in two scenes in the whole movie and yet her performance is probably the best in the whole film, she definitely deserves her Oscar nomination. Phillip Seymour Hoffman delivers a great performance as Father Flynn. The tension between him and Streep is palpable and it makes the film all the more watchable.",Doubt
239,proteus6847,Dubious: A Review of the Play,2,11 June 2012,"When a novice in English literature encounters the designation ""Mystery Play,"" he anticipates Agatha Christie and is surprised to discover the First and Last Things. John Patrick Shanley's play reverses that experience. As a drama about clerics entitled ""Doubt: A Parable,"" it leads one to expect a story of spiritual crisis, of the loss or hard-won preservation of Faith. These expectations are encouraged by the play's opening monologue, which touches briefly on that very theme. But this proves to be a red herring, for the topic vanishes immediately afterwards, never to reappear. Instead, the play devolves into a modest, middlebrow detective story about a nun who suspects a priest of being a pedophile.A small-m ""mystery,"" then, but one which remains unsolved, since we are never told whether the nun's suspicions are justifed. By withholding this information, Shanley seeks to validate his title and invest his play with an imposing ambiguity. All in vain, since debating the priest's guilt or innocence is as pointless as arguing about the Lady or the Tiger. On the evidence presented, either alternative is plausible, but since the author hasn't written a solution, there is literally no solution. That isn't ambiguity, it's gimmickry.Because in real life there would be a solution, and one which human effort could uncover. There hasn't been much ""doubt"" regarding clerical molestation, and there needn't be much doubt about the guilt or innocence of this play's Father Flynn. All one has to do is ask the adolescent boys that he's been teaching over the years.And here we stumble upon a serious problem, for the play never explains why the nun fails to question the relevant boys in her own school. She insists (with little basis) that one of them would lie to ""protect"" Father Flynn. Yet she admits seeing another student shrink from the priest's touch, and that boy certainly isn't disposed towards protective prevarication. Obviously, other students might have seen or heard something as well, yet the nun never bothers to speak to any of them. This frankly incredible oversight leaves an enormous hole in the story's plausibility, a hole that Shanley couldn't fill without destroying his gratuitous ""doubt.""Narrative illogic aside, this is a slight play, since a pedestrian puzzle that a couple of interviews can unravel is not an adequate metaphor for the mysteries that no one can solve. Does God hear our prayers? Is there a God at all? We will never know. ""Is Father Flynn an active pedophile?"" is simply not in the same league. Leaving the question unanswered does not make it profound, and of course there is no adequate reason to leave it unanswered in the first place.Only once does this conventional play invite its audience to think unconventionally, but the invitation can hardly be accepted. In a late scene the nun tells an African-American mother that Father Flynn may have victimized her son. Unexpectedly, the mother replies that she can live with that--her boy is gay, his prospects are nil, perhaps an influential older lover can give him a head-start, etc. She is not presented as a moral idiot, but as a desperate woman wanting the best for her child who feels driven to take the widest possible view. But while her attitude is striking, it is obviously unacceptable as a rule for action. Assuming arguendo that some children might derive some benefit from a pedophilic mentor, should we therefore allow pedophiles to flourish unabated? Judging from their victims' testimony, these ""mentors"" inflict enormous damage; if they ever do a child some good, they are likely to do him as much or greater harm. In the end, it really isn't possible to inject much complexity into this issue, and the mother's plea for tolerance on behalf of man-boy love does not persuade. If Father Flynn is seducing children, he should be removed from the parish, the priesthood, and society as well. There is nothing more to say about the matter, and consequently not much ""doubt."" For the rest, the play offers two-dimensional characters and serviceable dialogue. It holds the attention without gripping it.",Doubt
240,SpitztheGreat,Without question an instant classic,10,24 June 2009,"Before I begin I would just like to mention that this is my first rating of a ten I have ever given out. Perhaps that will mean something to you as you read this review.In the history of cinema there are some movies that either instantly, or eventually, became classics. Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, 12 Angry Men, Chinatown, The Shawshank Redemption, Forest Gump, etc, are all nearly universally acknowledged as classics that should be viewed by anyone. I dare say that I believe Doubt should be put among the list of movies that should be viewed by everyone. My only hesitation is in Doubt's difficult subject material and design. Where as Forest Gump may be a very easy to follow story, Doubt leaves much up to interpretation. However I reconcile this fact that to have any list of ""Greatest Movies"" the list should span all genres and tastes, so as a result Doubt goes on the list.Now that all the formalities are behind us I just want to stress how incredible the acting in this movie is. This is the movie that The Reader was trying to be. Where as Kate Winslet is amazing in The Reader Meryl Streep is equally, if not even more so, amazing in Doubt. Hoffman is equally amazing in his role and the two are polar opposites. The real surprise is Amy Adams who completes the triangle and manages to anchor the film. This is where Doubt accomplishes what The Reader could not, Adams' role is key to connecting the film and its characters with the audience. This key aspect is something that I felt was sorely lacking from The Reader.Most of what the film does well has been said already and I do not wish to further repeat others words. I would simple like to highlight the multiple layers that this film has which is simultaneously it's strength and most frustrating feature. The depth gives the move it's gravity and it's ability to really get under your skin, make you think, and keep you thinking after the credits have finished. However, some will walk away frustrated that a more definitive argument is not made. This is the nature of the beast.I am simply hard pressed to find something that the movie did wrong, or more aptly, didn't do superbly. Perhaps a bit of slowdown in the middle of the movie could be pointed out, but nothing that lingers for too long to be considered damaging to the films integrity. Every action, every scene, in the movie is outstanding and there is nothing that holds it back. Not an unnecessary scene, not an annoying/unimportant character who gets in the way, nothing.Now go watch the film, you may not give it a ten but it is surely worth your time!",Doubt

But I know what I like. I look for characters to be BELIEVABLE. I hope for a meaningful story in a movie of this kind (not necessary in action/adventure films). I pray for a plot that I can understand since all too many plots leave me wondering what I just watched.This film has it all! The casting was PERFECT, the acting was PERFECT. This is the first movie in which I have appreciated Meryl Streep. Amy Adams is PERFECT as the naive, trusting, young Nun. As is Philip Seymour Hoffman as the Priest. You watch his face carefully, your watch his body language for clues, you listen to the inflections in his speech ...

The movie is a careful exploration of human behavior.Bravo! A movie worth watching.",Doubt
242,lkdg32,I doubt this movie,1,3 January 2009,"I thought the trailer of this movie looked so good, but when I saw this movie, it was pretty bad. First of all, instead of the serious, to the point trailer, this was more like a drawn out comedy. Amy Adams character's bubbly traits completely contradicted the seriousness of how this movie should have been. Meryl Streep's character took forever to get to the point of the movie and start yelling at Philip Seymour Hoffman's character. Also Viola Davis's character had the pointless subplot of ""having to get to work"". That had nothing to do with the point of the movie and took away from it somewhat. Overall I was very disappointed with this movie after seeing such a great trailer.",Doubt
243,ReneWirtz,Doubt? Or question?,8,25 December 2008,"Saw this movie on Christmas Day charmed by the trailers and it has been a while that a movie without any action or CGI was able to grab my attention and hold it. The script lends itself for being very open to interpretation and that is exactly what you will take away from watching the movie: discussion points, because there is no flash back and there is no flash forward. Just the facts, although not hard by any definition, and a lot of circumstantial evidence. And therein lies the beauty and brilliance of the script and the movie, because I am under the impression that it is not only doubt that drives the motives of the protagonists, as it is the lack of questioning.The movie is very manipulative into making the audience believe a certain point of view which is evidenced by a few pieces of dialogue. But, and this may be my naiveté, I believe that Father Flynn only meant to be compassionate, forward thinking, open minded, sharing his love throughout his parish as opposed to Sister Aloysius fire & brimstone tactics of instilling the fear of god into each and everyone.Hence the title of my comment. Don't doubt, but question everything.",Doubt
244,viennashade,Brilliant from beginning to end,10,9 March 2014,"Unlike with other films, instead of counting the plot holes I am counting the cunning devices and remarkable performances and marveling at the dialogue and how everything fits together. I couldn't find any flaws, so I'm giving it 10 stars.So many powerful scenes here, including the confrontation, the talk on the park bench between Father Flynn and young Sister James, and the walk with Donald's mother.I thought because it was about religion it might get tedious, but I just wanted to rewind.Self-righteous principal Sister Aloysius suspects impropriety from her priest on a hunch, and determines to bring him down. She knows the delicate situation as he is her superior, but she plows ahead. He gets very angry at the accusations. Ordinarily to me this indicates guilt, but that it no doubt just another clever ploy in this wonderful script..When I heard his sermon that opened the movie, I definitely thought the doubt he was addressing was doubt of your faith, which I'm sure is a very common issue among every priest's parishioners. What do you say to that? It can't be easy to write a sermon...or even just to not put everybody to sleep, let alone to convince the doubters. I thought it was a fine sermon. But already this woman insisted on reading something into it that wasn't there, and began building her case.I know this type of abuse goes on and is dreadful and I don't mean to defend it in any way, but I also know that people can be framed and that also angers me. And this film shows how it could be done even by a well-meaning and upstanding person.That everyone in this film got an Oscar nomination was no surprise, and I think it was only due to a strong field that there were no wins.Meryl Streep is nothing short of amazing. She never made a wrong move. It was fascinating to watch the way her character swung so easily from unreasonably cruel to glimmers of humanity.The lead actor was brilliantly cast in Philip Seymour Hoffman, whose sleazy expressions combined with his hairstyle to make him look like he could be a pedophile; while his kindly expressions and ideas and actions made him seem like the model priest...for the perfect balance of good and bad. In every scene I kept thinking how incredible to be able to make yourself look so convincingly innocent, yet also make yourself look guilty at the same time. Mesmerizing.Viola Davis stunned. She delivered lines that sounded so unfeeling and unlikely, and made them believable to your very core. Heartbreaking, raw, real. Amy Adams was also deserving, but her role was more subtle.We never find out for sure if Father Flynn is guilty or innocent. I know what I believe, based on what we are shown of his actions and his character, but without true evidence, that is all there is to go on. In other words, just like life.Father Flynn advocates loving children. He's a little sleazy, he's got long nails, he smokes, he wants to modernize the Church... They throw just enough at you to make you...doubt.",Doubt
245,tmcona-1,The Actors were better than the movie.,7,12 February 2009,"The number one thing that I take from Doubt is the acting. It is absolutely outstanding. Meryl Streep is a close tie with Kate Winslet for Best Actress, and Amy Admas and Viola Davis are neck and neck in my opinion. Philip Seymour Hoffman really steals the show for me in this one, one of Hoffman's best performances ever. Streep also gives one of the best performances of her acting career. However this is all I get from this film, the acting. The plot and it's slow moving pace sort of turned me off. Don't get me wrong the story is outstanding and the concepts are good, but this film just moves a little too long for me. The actors outshine the plot. I realized this from the beginning. In my opinion this film highlights meaningless and unimportant characters far too much. The plot is overdrawn a bit too much. The actors save this from being just an average film however. Please see the film though, it is well worth the 2 hours. 7/10.",Doubt

Hoffman and Streep are magnificent and kudos to everyone else for a job well done. Without giving it away, the last 60 seconds, although predictable in a way, felt jarring and somewhat out of place. But I'm hard put to figure out a different way to end it. Both Streep's and Hoffman's characters are complex and finely drawn, and at the end of the film you find yourself shocked in a way not quite expected. It's a terrifically intelligent screenplay--gets my vote for the Oscar--and beautifully directed and edited.

249,nferlisi,Thinking About Doubt,7,13 November 2019,"Doubt is a film that takes what made it such an impactful show on the stage and transfer it to the silver screen. There are many things stage plays and films do differently in order to bring to life the stories they wish to tell, however, there are times where it can feel similar. The production of Doubt is note complicated one, not requiring large production value when it comes to sets, costumes, lighting, and such. Rather than focus so meticulously on the visuals or spectacle of visuals, this film centers its focus on the intelligent writing and powerful performances of the casts. With John Patrick Stanley, writer of the original stage play, coming in to helm the film as the director and a primary cast consisting of Meryl Streep, Amy Adams and Phillip Seymour Hoffman- nothing but excellence could be expected.I have admired many of the principals casts' performances throughout their respected careers. I would say that there is no denying these performances form the principal cast can be considered some of their career bests. These performances from Meryl Streep, Amy Adams and Phillip Seymour Hoffman have such power and emotion resonating with each dramatically fueled scene. The actors took a very high level of seriousness in order to sell each scene well. A major contributor to the fine tuned performances comes the well-written screenplay. I think having the original author/writer of the stage play invites certain advantages to push the progress the production smoothly. The story John Patrick Stanley's crafts is not only emotionally impactful, but it is also highly thought provoking. Keeping you invested in the story, constantly wondering that truly happened in the story's central conflict. Another bug part about this film is its handling of themes- including religion, morality, and humanity. All themes go hand in hand when creating tension, power, and emotion between the characters. I found myself ""in doubt"" whether or not I knew the real answer to the central conflict, which I find very good by the end. Thought provoking films have a good way of keeping audiences invested and wanting to know more. So again, this film exceeds that greatly to the very end.Overall I found Doubt to be a film with a great deal of power and really making you think while watching it. I can see what all the buzz was about when i first heard about it. An adaptation that exceeds well and performs very highly. If I ever get the chance to see the theatrical stage production I'm going to take it.

250,randy-377,Undoubtedly Good,10,30 May 2009,"It's 1963, ten years away from the American Psychiatric Association removing homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, thus negating its previous definition of homosexuality as a clinical mental disorder. What's important to remember is that this film is not about acts of sexuality, but about insinuations and the harm they can do. In 1963, people were blackmailed for their sexuality, and that is really what this is about. Was the priest gay? Undoubtedly. Did he have inappropriate sex with the boy? No. But it was enough, based on a cruel intuition of a very controlling person, who essentially guessed correctly. Sister Aloysius is extremely unlikable and then there are flashes of charm and warmth—we are asked to take sides. The fact is, in this situation Father Flynn is an extremely good priest. His empathy with the Miller boy is appreciated and in what has to be one of the great speeches about brotherhood, the mother understands, which is truly, truly unique. This film is directed like a poem: no line of dialogue, no gesture, no nuance is meaningless. And in the scene where the nun brings in the dead mouse, it is the metaphor for the movie-a cat and mouse chase. She has suspicions and a deep sense of injustice that priest have so much authority. She doesn't like Flynn as they are by nature, opposites. Father Flynn and Sister James are life-affirming, progressive people in an environment that has animus towards change. Father Flynn has a speech about how we are all guilty of something, and in in the shooting gallery of sins, Sister Aloysius picks homosexuality. Is he guilty? In theory, no. The church says it is OK to be homosexual, but not physical acts of homosexuality. Father Flynn is guilty of something although we are not exactly aware of what it is, but it is enough to make him leave. The end, the doubts that Sister Aloysius confesses seem to more about the nature of the church and her own faith, then that she forced a good priest to leave. She is demoted by her action, thus, confirming her own distrust of the institution. This may be a film about good versus evil, kindness over control, faith versus trust. It is also about the church itself, which does in fact, reward priests who have moved on from empathy to sexuality. The truth is always seen at an angle, and it depends on where you're standing. The fact that the truth is usually so complex, so multi-layered is the essence of this film.",Doubt

I think horror films should take this tactic into consideration - we can create the monster ourselves, fear comes from the suggestion.One of the quietest films I have ever seen - and ever INCH of film is worth watching - over and over.

255,oscarfanatic,This is assuredly the Best Film of 2008!!!,10,26 December 2008,"When I heard that John Patrick Shanley's play was being adapted into a movie, I went head over heals crazy. But when it started getting iffy reviews, I began to worry. Now that I have seen it, let me say: this is by and large the best movie of 2008.First off, this has to be one of the best acted movies I have ever seen. And for the people who think that Meryl Streep is anything less than brilliant in this role: Were you watching the same movie as me? She was PHENOMENAL! She studied this role to a tee and delivered a performance of such depth and emotion! Her Sister Aloysius is a force to be reckoned with, a person who goes wholeheartedly for what she believes is true and just. I do not think that her actions in the situation were malicious at all. Everything she did was out of concern for her parish. She would never want to compromise the wellbeing of any of her students. The scenes between Streep and Hoffman are the best acting I have seen in a long time. They play off each other so well, and watching the sparks fly between them is so worthwhile. Each character has their own convictions and each is doing what they believe to be the right thing. Their acting is injected with a sense of duty, really. They know their job, and each go about doing the way they know how.As for the supporting players: Viola Davis and Amy Adams were both magnificent. Though Adams as Sister James doesn't stray far from the innocent roles she has played before, this one has a little more meat to it. She acts out in fine fashion. Sister James loves without question and believes the best about everyone, because, well, that is what her faith tells her to believe. And Viola Davis does SOOOOO much with the little screen time that is allotted her. She is just trying to protect her son. Every facet of this woman's life is driven toward giving her son a better life than she had. And so she can't understand why Aloysius wants to use her son as a pawn in her plan to push out what she believes to be immoral and unholy. She holds well up against Miss Streep in her scene, and after her voice is heard, the whole feel of the movie changes from one of suspicion to one of understanding.Roger Deakins does some of his best work this year as cinematographer here, using each shot to convey the feelings of each character. Great color palate for the film as well, making for a dreary and gloomy feel that makes watching the movie a thrilling experience. Please, Academy, nominate this film for best picture! Artistry can find no higher form than this.A very very solid 10 out of 10 (for the best picture of the year!)",Doubt
256,pcbrooks,Doubt... and Disillusionment,10,18 December 2009,"Just a reminder: what follows is a spoiler.Undoubtedly an excellent story, and well-deserving of its plaudits. Likewise the acting, which is superb.I disagree with other commenters though in their conclusion that at the end of the movie, doubt concerning Father Flynn's guilt still remains, and that Sister Aloysius is a single-minded overbearing tyrant.If nothing else, the story is an exercise in deductive reasoning. Once presented with all the evidence, one is left with the same conviction that is possessed by Sister Aloysius: namely, that Father Flynn is indeed guilty as charged.He took advantage of a child whose sexuality was already recognized by his parents and had caused him to leave a prior school. It doesn't matter whether the child was a willing participant (as is clearly the case), he was still a child and Father Flynn had an obligation as an adult not to take advantage of that. That is as true now as it was in 1964, the time in which the story is set.With Father Flynn the child was attempting to create the relationship so clearly missing with his own father, who tried to physically beat him into something he could not be. The mother recognized the child's nature yet still permitted abuse by his father, a situation that is still commonplace today in dysfunctional families where one parent passively permits abuse by the other, for a variety of reasons.The inexperienced and readily manipulated Sister James is all too willing to accept Father Flynn's explanation because the alternative is for her unthinkable. She reflects the discomfort that the majority of us would feel in the same position.The final piece of the jigsaw is revealed when Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that when confronted with the information that a nun at his prior parish had confirmed his previous inappropriate behavior, Father Flynn had demanded to know the name of the nun rather than denounce the claim as untrue. Sister Aloysius had not contacted anyone at his prior parish - hers was a shot in the dark and it connected. Father Flynn's bluster and bravado crumpled at that point, which is not what would have happened had he been completely innocent.Having managed to protect the child (and possibly even more children - the reality has been that those priests who have admitted to inappropriate behavior have done so in literally hundreds of instances, not just one or two) from the attentions of Father Flynn, Sister Aloysius is inevitably and inescapably driven into a position where she now doubts her own faith.How could any God worthy of the name allow such execrable things (physical violence, abandonment and sexual exploitation by those in whom a child should be able to place absolute trust) to happen to the young children for whom he claimed to have such love?It should be pointed out that the story is not anti-gay. No mention is made that the nature of either the child or Father Flynn is anything other than normal.What is wrong, however, is the failure of an authority figure (Father Flynn) to maintain the correct level of trust and responsibility when dealing with a minor. Had the child in fact been a fellow adult, there would have been no issue (although of course we know that even today such a relationship is still a contentious issue, even between consenting adults - and it should not be).The tragedy is that Sister Aloysius did the right thing - she maintained the responsibility she had been given (namely to look after the best interests of the child) - but paid the price of beginning to lose her faith. She doesn't lose it absolutely - we are simply told that she now has severe doubts - and one could extrapolate to a future in which she reconciles her beliefs with what she has experienced; however, it is my opinion that ultimately she must lose her faith if she is to remain true to herself and her principles.This excellent story tells itself through a process whereby some of the facts are provided to the audience indirectly.On that basis I suggest that the title is missing a key piece of information. It should read: ""Doubt... and Disillusionment"".",Doubt

The dialogs have a way of making you feel the emotion of the character they were spoken from, and just when you think you finally get who is wrong and who is right, there comes a symbol of some sort, or an action of one of the characters that makes you doubt them some more.The movie is beautifully directed by John Patrick Shanley, who also wrote the scrip for the movie and the play its based on, so we can say that the adaptation is quite remarkable.The end of the movie brings us face to face with one of the most natural and common feelings that a person has, even though they can shout out laud that they were ""certain"" of something or someone, Doubt.This is quite a remarkable movie that needs to bee seen and seen again to understand, but i highly doubt that anyone will figure out who is right or wrong.",Doubt
259,Jazzist-H-Crisp,A story loaded in favour of the abuser,3,5 November 2010,"Paedophile crime is hard to detect. The child victims are often afraid to speak about it, or too lonely, or feeling guilty - the victims are, after all, only children. A paedophile who is a priest, by contrast, has good social position, authority, the trust of the parents and easy access to children. Such priests are even able to persuade their victims that what they did together was natural, or a sin the priest can absolve, or even put the blame on the victims.""Doubt"" presents us with a case of possible child abuse by a priest. The 'doubt' of the title arises because the two nuns who accuse him have only circumstantial evidence to go on. The basic moral point is therefore that we should give the priest the benefit of the doubt and avoid rushing to judgment. That would be a matter of simple justice, but the story goes further than that.The story is loaded in favour of the possibly abusive priest. He is humorous, liberal in his outlook and popular with the pupils. The principal nun, by contrast, is grim, authoritarian and probably sexually frustrated. Her accusations of improper relations between the priest and a boy pupil therefore seem to us to reflect more on her own deficiencies than on any harm that the priest may have done. Given the characters involved, we are inclined to side with the priest and to dismiss the accusations against him as mere jealousy.The story then swings entirely on to the side of the priest. The boy's mother tells the principal nun that she is glad that the priest has been so nice to her son because the boy was lonely and isolated. She seems to think that her son is lucky to have the support of the priest and that sexual relations are a small price to pay for such help. Any doubt that the film might have acknowledged about adult-child relationships is here swept aside. The conclusion offered is that we should not be worried about possible cases of paedophile crime because the parents condone it anyway. Any doubts that we may have had about a suspect priest should be dropped.In the real world parents are not so casual about sexual predators. As an antidote to ""Doubt"", I recommend ""Deliver Us From Evil"", a documentary about Oliver O'Grady, a paedophile priest who operated in California for years until he was sent to prison. Whenever there were accusations the bishops just moved him on to a new parish to start all over again. The film includes interviews with O'Grady, his victims and the parents of his victims. The indulgent attitude of the parent in ""Doubt"" is nowhere to be seen in the documentary. Those parents are shocked, outraged and angry. They feel betrayed and exploited. Nor are the victims grateful to their abuser. He wrecked their lives.""Doubt"" is a gripping story, well acted. As a drama it works well, but its moral purpose is indefensible. Of that I have no doubt.",Doubt
260,DexterManning,Doubt: A Review.,8,31 January 2009,"Central to this story's concerns are not so much the clergy and religion (those are mostly tools to help serve the story), but the nature of people's perceptions of certain events and of one another, their convictions that those perceptions are factually accurate, how they act upon those convictions (whether they are correct or misguided), and the consequences of those actions. (And, yes, one issue does beget the next.) It is about people believing what they want to believe, even if to do so they must turn the other cheek.It could not have been an easy task to incorporate so many essential human conditions into one story, and develop them as well they have been here, but John Patrick Shanley, who both directed the film and adapted his own play from stage to screen, has succeeded in what is easily one of the best-written films of the year.These themes could occur in any place or at any time, but it makes sense that Shanley chooses to set it in a Catholic church and school located in the Bronx in the mid 1960s, a year after President Kennedy's assassination. It is, arguably, a time when people within the country have doubts about the world and themselves and, perhaps, looks to their religion and faith to find some hint of reassurance. Yet, over a relatively short time, that stability and certainty is challenged for the small group of nuns, clergy, parishioners, teachers and parents at the center of this story.This is one of the better stage-to-screen adaptations in recent memory despite the fact that it was directed by the same person who wrote the original play. I don't mean that as an automatic criticism of all such movies; it's just that many such films, in their execution, are sometimes too ""stagey""mere replicas of the shows they were based on, rather than assured transformations from one medium to another. (""The History Boys"" and the newer, musical version of ""The Producers"" are good examples of good stage shows turned into poor movies because their basic cinematic requirements were ignored.) An oft-overlooked fact is that each medium has its own distinct conventions and opportunities to be taken advantage of.""Doubt"" does not entirely overcome this transitional problem. The entire production still feels rather theatrical, which is not necessarily a criticism in and of itself. However, some scenes do look a bit overly-staged here and there, especially when the sole action on the screenand from the speakersconsists of characters standing and talking to one another. Of course, this story is told much more through dialogue than physical action, so it is expected that most of the running time would be devoted to characters speaking. Notwithstanding this, little cinematic touches could have been introduced to make the whole affair seem more cinematic without sacrificing the simplicity that works so much to the film's benefit. One obvious touch would be the addition of a bit more music to the soundtrack. It's ironic that Howard Shore, one of the most revered film score composers working today, was hired for this movie, yet his work is only infrequently used.The somewhat static quality brought on by the occasional staginess, in any case, is a relatively small criticism, which the writingthe meat and potatoes of the filmeasily overcomes. Shanley clearly is an expert at the art of metaphor, a talent which abounds in his script, sometimes a little too often or too humorously, but never so much as to be a true distraction; it's usually just enough to make things more interesting. Some of the more memorable uses involve the weather, a light bulb, glasses of milk and, best of all, a bloody steak.If you were not able to see the theatrical play (even if you did see it) go see this film. You may wish you had seen the play. If you're not religious, don't let the church setting, and presence of nuns and priests scare you away, as it's about something more fundamental and universal than religion. No matter what your persuasion, it merits a close viewing.",Doubt

Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are a striking pair to put together. It was not just them, but Amy Adams's role in the film as well, maybe even better than Streep and Hoffman, that made this a MASTERPIECE. I could go on for days about the film's acting. The acting was so great, I didn't know who to believe, and that's what this film achieves. The film starts off really slowly like an alligator creeping up on it's pray, pure silence, then it attacks, like a fierce cheetah, grabbing a hold of you and never lets go until the sad end, and you're sad that the picture is over. But from the beginning to end, its so very mysterious. It doesn't reveal too much. A tragedy that its over now. It's an absolute thrill watching this film. You get to really know this characters, and in a way you don't. It's a mystery. It's interesting. In the end, you feel, really feel, for the plot's loser. That's acting. I was constantly in thought during this film. Amy Adams's performance is magic, bringing to viewers I think a kind of sorrowfulness, great character, and remorse. The writing is flawless and the directing is so visionary, what can I say? John Patrick Shanely, adapting the film from his own play, knew exactly what his vision was for this film, and he achieved it. The close ups in this film are masterful. Meryl Streep is sort of like a villain in this film, seemingly cruel, but sticks to her mind, and Hoffman is the priest, but you know he has a secret, from the very beginning. How this was not nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, I don't know. I wish to thank every single person involved in the making of this picture, all those who were on the credits, and those who weren't. Thank you for this experience. A perfect 10 out of 10.",Doubt
264,The_Film_Addict,"Unable to provide clear-cut answers, ""Doubt's"" ambiguity brilliantly has audiences do what every great film does: think",9,4 January 2009,"""Doubt can be a bond as powerful as certainty,"" says Father Brendan Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to his diligently observant congregation as they sit attentively during his sermon. Though little sense can be derived from those inescapable words, by the end of the film, Doubt will have made its case. Supported by a phenomenal, intelligent screenplay and headed by a prestigious cast, ""Doubt"" is a fascinating picture that explores complex emotions in astounding ways. Unable to provide clear-cut answers, ""Doubt's"" ambiguity brilliantly has audiences do what every great film does: think.When the overly naïve Sister James (Amy Adams) believes Father Brendan Flynn (Hoffman) to be abusing Donald (Joseph Foster), the only African American student at St. Nicholas Catholic school, she immediately confides in stern-faced school principal Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), who believes in the value of fear, intimidation and punishment. Pushing Sister James' accusation into the realm of sexual molestation, Sister Aloysius Beauvier sets out to unravel the truth behind Father Flynn's motives by meddling deep within his affairs. Fearing his image to be tainted, Father Flynn, radiating anger, fear and frustration, warns Sister Aloysius to steer clear from her suspicions when he firmly tells her to, ""Let it go."" Sister Aloysius does other wise.Like some escalating boxing match, writer/director John Patrick Shanley, who also helmed the original Broadway Pulitzer Prize-winning play, injects this film with a dose of mystery and anticipation. With determined thoroughness, Shanley expands each character's harrowing conviction with such vigor and grace that the world created in ""Doubt"" is impossible to turn away from. With the rise in child molestation cases the Catholic church has been getting drowned in, one would naturally assume ""Doubt"" to be a finger pointing morality piece; however, though the issue is raised, ""Doubt"" instead becomes a palpable, thought provoking film about the fears and insecurities within all of us.In essence, Doubt is a showcase of vicious talent that is driven by its superior cast. Screen legend Meryl Streep comfortably eases her way into the role Sister Aloysius Beauvier with a mesmerizing balance of poise and perplexity. Without a doubt, Streep has created one of the most compelling characters of the year. Foil to Sister Aloysius is Father Flynn, fleshed out by the incomparable Phillip Seymour Hoffman who exhibits emotion so perfectly that his collision with Sister Aloysius is utterly fascinating. Torn between Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn is Sister James played by the lovely and talented Amy Adams, who has shown an incredible, exuberant growth since her debut as the sultry vixen in ""Drop Dead Gorgeous."" Limited to a minuscule performance as the boy's mother is Viola Davis, who in less the 15 minutes of screen time, brings the show to a complete halt by providing a genuine, raw performance. ""Doubt's"" ensemble is breathtaking.At the core of ""Doubt"" is lies a poignant and somewhat cryptic message about our morality and driving convictions. The clash between the film's protagonists is a bitter, multilayered battle that is exemplified by its extraordinary characters. Apart from Flynn's accusation, Sister Aloysius, who devoutly honors the traditions of the church, is threatened by Father Flynn, the progressive Father who wants to bring change. Though Sister Aloysius's actions may be filled with authoritative strictness, overall, she means well. As for Father Flynn, who faces serious allegations, goes to lengths to protect his secret, though whatever that secret may be, will have to be resolved by the viewer.With show stopping performances, and a tightly written screenplay, ""Doubt"" is single-handedly an extraordinary tour-de-force of skill and talent. It's extraordinary and powerfully moving; at the end of the film, Sister Aloysius and Sister James have a thoughtful discussion, Sister Aloysius, sitting quietly, conceals her crucifix and breakdowns. What she says afterwards left me emotionally shaken.",Doubt
265,reginaszymczak,High-Quality; No-Brainer,9,22 April 2013,"If you go to a screening of John Patrick Shanley's Doubt, you will also be attending a Master Class in acting. When I was sitting in the theatre I was giddy. Having read the play in college, I knew I was about to watch a film about a priest who may or may not have committed inappropriate acts with an altar boy. Not the cheeriest of subjects, but I was giddy nonetheless. This is like the ideal Superbowl; the two best teams facing off under the best conditions, in the best arena. Here we have two Academy Award winners going head to head in a story that not only won the Tony for Best Play, but also the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.Doubt tells the story of a charismatic priest played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who reaches out to the first black student to be enrolled in a Catholic Parrish in 1964. This special attention is noticed by the young and idealistic Sister James played by Amy Adams, who dutifully reports her findings to the Parrish's iron- clad principal, Sister Aloysius. Needing nothing more than second-hand conjectures and her own moral certainty, Aloysius is determined to go to the ends of the Earth to prove her suspicions as truth regardless of the cost.What both the film and play do so well is the same thing that I liked about 2006's Little Children. As soon as you find yourself feeling sympathy for one character, a change of perspective, a peculiar word choice, or even an eye flinch will turn your opinion upside down and back again.What I loved about the play when I first read it was the attempt to challenge the audience in regards to our uncontrollable, involuntary snap judgments. Instead of making the priest a creepy deviant who spends his days lurking around corners, Shanley writes Father Flynn as a man from the working class Northeast who plays basketball, has a great sense of humor and wit, and an undeniable charisma. His adversary, the woman who is trying to convict a man of child molestation, isn't a young and beautiful, bright-eyed underdog but an aging, miserly tyrant. Cherry Jones, who originated the role on Broadway and won the Tony, went out for every performance with her eyebrows combed downward and without an ounce of make-up.""When you take a step against wrongdoing, you are taking a step away from God, but in His service."" That is the most revealing clue the audience will have into the character of Sister Aloysius. Her relentless and unforgiving determination drives her to do things that she admits takes her away from God's will in order to carry out his justice... But at what cost?All four of the lead actors were nominated for Oscars including Tony Award winner, Viola Davis and previously nominated Amy Adams. Although I adore Amy Adams, her weakness definitely showed in the shadow of these powerhouses. She made the right choices but almost to a fault.

268,sprintz1132,"Fantastic acting, interesting story",9,18 April 2009,"Doubt could easily be dismissed as an Oscar-bait movie. An argument could be made that people are just distracted by the star-studded cast. This movie, however, is a testimony to how a performance driven film can be powerful, have substance, and hold its own against other, more exciting plot lines and visual effects. I've come to admire a movie that can stick to the script with no frills and Doubt surprised me in that it kept my attention all the way through with nothing but excellent character acting and a mystery.Sr. Aloysius (Meryl Streep) plays a hard-tact nun with a strict obedience policy. When she learns from Sr. James (Amy Adams) about a possible odd occurrence between the parish priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and the school's first black student, Donald Miller, Sr. Aloysius embarks on a crusade to prove Father Flynn's guilt. She has almost no proof whatsoever, but she has fervor and total conviction and she's convinced herself that nothing will stand in her way of doing the right thing. Flynn, the church's new, young priest has a substantial argument to confirm that he is completely blameless for any suspicions. Each side has a convincing stancebut is he guilty or isn't he? The sparks fly from the confrontations that happen between the two powerhouses of Streep and Hoffman. Their characters are so easy to make into villains but each portrays such strong convictions toward the greater good that it is near impossible to decide which is wrong. Streep is an absolute force of nature. Her portrayal of Aloysius is one of unchecked authority. In order to play a woman who nobody would dare question (lest they have a death wish), you must be believable, and Streep is purely authentic. Hoffman, too, blew me away. I can't imagine a more difficult person to portray, but he managed to pull off one of the most original performances I've ever seen.In such an emotionally charged film, there also needs to be a strong protagonist. In this case, that role belongs to Sr. James, played in all her sweet, naïve glory by Adams.The point in the movie in which the story fully rounds itself out is the confrontation between Sr. Aloysius and Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis). With a mere 12 minutes of screen time, Davis expels an incredible flood of emotion with careful restraint. Her performance is heart wrenching and beautiful at the same time.I've noticed that some critics complain that the story lacks a big conclusion considering the heavy subject matter, but I think the final confrontation between Aloysius and Flynn is something of a grand finale. It tells you and I, as viewers, that we're pretty much never going to know who is blameworthy. Both of them will not budge and the story comes to a screeching halt. Ending the movie the way they did end it was a brave choice. They didn't simply hand us the answer to the main question, they allow us to figure it out for ourselves.My grade: A-",Doubt

Alternatively this movie has many. It is a tightly woven story; likely because the playwright also did the screenplay. Almost everything is a double-entendre, but if you want to be immersed from the moment the film starts, keep the idea in the back of your mind that everything has its own ""nature"", and that we trap ourselves controlling it.Hoffman, Streep, Adams and Davis are all magnificent. Streep plays a lot of herself, but don't let that overshadow the complexities of her character. Hoffman is probably more enigmatic, and rightfully so; his portrayal is more akin to his ""Capote"". Davis, who has only one scene, takes advantage of every moment the camera is on her; watch her emotions.What some may find frustrating is the the visuals do not reveal the ""answer"" as to whether something did or did not happen between the sole Black student and Father Flynn.There are so many themes keeping them separate in mind may be difficult, but the underlying tone is one for me that questions whether in order to have conviction about something, one must internally suppress one's severe doubts. Imagine the juror in a capital case where execution is sought, struggling with the doubts that must be overcome by a decision based upon circumstantial evidence that could take a life. ""12 Angry Men"" comes to mind.If you come away depressed, or confused, do not despair. One of the struggles I saw was whether discipline and order stand in the way of the truth. Watch as it all unfolds, and how much effort it takes the characters (Father Flynn and Sister Aloyisus) must take in order not to reveal the truth.But if you were expecting a ""deus ex machina"" to reveal all, the final scene will prove equally dissatisfying. Look beyond the ""crime"" and into the substance of the nature of the characters and everything they do. This will also help understand a vignette involving the cat and mouse. Enjoy.",Doubt

Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman really shine and put on brilliant performances. The title of the movie simply says it all. Right from the beginning, Father Flynn's sermon about ""doubt"" already sets the whole tone of the movie. Throughout the movie, doubt after doubt after doubt stack up together, creating a baseless and dangerous certainty. That kind of certainty is clearly evident in Sister Aloysius, who draws conclusions without any proof. I was shocked to learn nearing the end of the movie that her suspicions and prejudice towards Father Flynn stemmed from something so petty and insignificant. What's more astonishing is the lengths she can go to prove herself right. I think her pursuit for the truth is deviated and is nothing more than just a self satisfying act to prove her righteousness. I think her repeated statement throughout the movie, ""in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God"" is merely an excuse to justify her own actions. I feel sad to see towards the end she still thinks she is right, even though failing to prove Father Flynn's guilt to anyone besides herself. But then again, these are just my thoughts. The movie leaves the case open to other conclusions. Personally, I choose to look at the good in people, hence I sympathize more with Father Flynn's predicament. Father Flynn's second sermon in the movie that touches on ""gossip"", really leaves a strong impression. The metaphor he used is by far the most accurate and solid one I've ever heard. After watching this movie, it stirred me to think about many things related to ""doubt"". I strongly believe that doubt is a double-edged sword. It can be empowering and enlightening when used for the right purposes, or it can be a weapon of mass destruction. In other words, doubt can be constructive or destructive. The other thing I thought about was doubt on others and self doubt. Suddenly, I just find that such a simple word can translate into so many different interpretations. The complexity of the human mind and emotion is really fascinating. Lastly, I just want to share a quote from the movie by Father Flynn, which was particularly memorable and inspiring to me. ""There are people who go after your humanity, Sister, that tell you that the light in your heart is a weakness. Don't believe it. It's an old tactic of cruel people to kill kindness in the name of virtue. There's nothing wrong with love.""",Doubt

So, I can't exactly say I wasn't warned.The movie begins by constructing and displaying the personality of the characters involved, adds some suspenseful music just to keep you guessing what's around the corner, turns belly up about half-way in, and ends in a blurry, unfinished mess to the complete befuddlement and dissatisfaction of the viewer. Streep and Hoffman certainly played their parts adequately, but that is as much acclaim as can be had for this sleeping pill, in my opinion. It is NOT suspenseful, it is NOT a nail-biter, my daughter and I literally found ourselves nodding off rather than on the edge of our seat, and it's anyone's guess why the very end of the movie has Sis. Beauvier bawling her head off about how she's always doubting things. Boom. The movie suddenly ends on that point--as if the writers had no idea how to truly end it and simply chopped it off just then. It's pointless, doesn't fit with the movie at all, and had my daughter and me looking at each other incredulously and saying, ""Huhhhh??"" We couldn't help but to laugh.One finds himself tolerating the blandness from scene to scene for at least half the movie--if for no other reason than to see if a plot or the promised suspense actually ever develops. It is highly predictable and highly lacking in its delivery, though I can not fault the actors. In fact much of the movie seems like a ""two-man band"" with Streep and Hoffman merely playing out a script between each other from scene to scene and Amy Adams popping in from time to time just to remind us how tediously prim, proper, and lackluster sexually-repressed women were in the 1800s (neverminding that the movie was set in 1964).I must admit it was refreshing to see Hoffman play something other than the quintessential and overtly gay man . . . he did the job rather well and sustained the emotional life of the movie. For this I give it two stars.",Doubt

I think that John Patrick Shanley (the writer, director) didn't have enough muscle to handle this enormous talents. Meryl's nun couldn't hide anywhere, she carries her intolerance, frustration and repression on her sleeve. She knows she is hated but according to her, that's her job. No, I didn't believe it. I thought what Vanessa Redgrave, Liv Ullman, Helen Mirren even Cherry Jones who played her on the stage could have done with this creature and then, Philip Seymour Hoffman's priest, without a single vibe of sexuality, imagine what Montgomery Clift could have done with that! After saying what I've said I also have to add that the film is never boring and that is also merit of the miscast leads. They are great fun to watch.

The two women, working together on this set, became fast friends. And this particular scene was Davis' rocket to stardom.When Davis received her star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame in 2012, Streep was there, not just to cheer her on. She gave a speech, saying,""Viola Davis is possessed. She is possessed to the blazing, incandescent power. She is arguably the most immediate, responsive artist I have ever worked with,"" Meryl Streep then went on to describe Davis's ability to be ""so alive she glistens"" and to ""write paragraphs with her eyes.""Watch the interplay between Meryl Streep and Viola Davis, and you will understand the respect, the admiration, and the brilliance they share.",Doubt
287,darkteam_manu,Truly thought-provoking,9,25 December 2008,"""Sometimes doubt can be a bond as strong as certainty"" The movie, which is based on the Puliter-prize winning play by writer/director John Patrick Shanley, is set in the 1960s in a Catholic school which is run by principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) who accuses a priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) of abusing the school's first black student, Donald Miller. Sister James (Amy Adams) and Douglas's mom (Viola Davis) step into the fray as they both are dragged into this mess by Sister Aloysius.Now, for the analysis: I gave this movie 9 out of 10 simply because it is magnificent. I think Shanley directed this excellently mainly because it was his play, and no one would know how to portray this better than him. The screenplay was extremely suspenseful and filled with moral lessons that we can all take from this movie if we just pay attention.The acting was superb, and that's not just my opinion apparently; Every main actor in this movie received a nomination for their performance in the golden globes (Streep, Adams, Hoffman, and Davis)and i wouldn't be surprised to see those names pop out during Oscar nominations. In fact, I would be extremely disappointed not to see them up there. Streep took the lead splendidly, creating a heartless, cold character which we despise at first, but we end up having trouble deciding whether she is a hero or a false accuser. Then comes Hoffman who shows why he is such a good actor; the sermons he delivered were frightening; we could feel his frustration and anger in his voice every time he spoke. Amy Adams lit up the screen with her innocent, lovable character and i think was excellently casted for the role. And of course, Ms Davis who, in one scene, received a golden globe nomination. It was as if she were truly the boy's mother.Doubt is a fantastic, worth-seeing movie. In fact, the whole movie the audience are the ones who are having doubts on who to believe. All the people that were with me were split on whether to side with Sister Aloysius or Father Flynn. Amy Adams' character shows us how important kindness and down-right decency is in the world. I haven't seen Frost/Nixon yet but i firmly believe this is the best movie of 2008.",Doubt
288,wonder-32,Not as profound as I had hoped,6,27 December 2008,"I was not happy with the ending of the film, a contrite Sister Aloysious was not real to me and I ""knew"" her in 1963 very well.I thought the acting of this film superb.. The acid test for me was when Meryl Streep opened her mouth and out rolled the ""Bronx Irish Catholic"" (or BIC as we called it) accent of the Sisters of Charity of NYC. The filming of the interior scenes at the College of Mount St. Vincent in Riverdale was very appropriate and slammed me right back there with the college chapel all done up in Pre-Vatican II style. Yikes! The RC Church was a dreary place back then and I am sure the nuns who were there in the Mother Seton habits of the day, feel the same seeing it all again. The S of C Community was strict and unforgiving; the Sisters who were the strongest, were tyrants in the convent as well as the schools. Living that way was hard, and may still be, but at least they may have a sip of wine now and then as other Orders of nuns do, and of course they are out of the silly attire.Now, I am not so sure a young nun would have had her suspicions raised as readily as this young one did in the film. Afterall, what did any of us know about sex abuse back then? She may have suspected corporal punishment of the child by the priest but I cannot imagine she would have guessed more. I may be wrong, but this nun was especially child-like.. but of course, she may have been a victim herself and in that case,it would be understandable.",Doubt
289,novak38,Are we meant to feel sorry for the priest or the nun or the boy?,6,14 August 2009,"Meryl Streep makes a very severe looking nun. Her opening scenes fill one with dread and anticipation. It's a good performance that she sustains throughout the entire film.Despite this good performance, I never thought there was any real drama in the film because the audience is really kept in the dark too much.We are meant to suspect the priest of supposed wrongdoings based on Streep's ""feelings"" about him. She says that ""she knows people"" and once she's made up her mind she won't take no for an answer.When she eventually traps the priest with a lie, are we meant to feel sorry for the priest or the nun or the boy? It seems the nun's morals are not much better than the priest's, if we're to believe her version of the truth.For all intents and purposes the priest could be helping the boy because the boy is being harassed at school. If Streep's character had opened her eyes, she'd see the possibility of this being the case. However, as she maintains that her first impressions are always right, the priest never really gets a chance to defend himself.And as none of us knows what really happened -if anything happened- we really are in doubt.We get no real insight to the character of any of the children and only one parent is spoken to, and even she doesn't want to listen to Meryl's arguments. Then, to our horror, we find out that obviously whatever's going on at home for her son is much worse than what's going on at school.The boy in question doesn't get much to do or say. He's just as much a victim as the priest is, but most people would probably suspect the priest anyway once someone like Streep's character had sewn the seeds of doubt in their mind.All in all a good enough film, but one that just needed a stronger dramatic punch to give it a harder edge.",Doubt
290,mago1942,"Rigid personal values, not a culture",10,12 July 2009,"""Doubt"" is a great movie, in which two talented actors (Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman) reward the spectator with outstanding performances. It is impossible not to spend a lot of time thinking about what happens in this story after having seen the film.Someone put me an interesting question about what would really be happening there: Could Father Flynn be mainly seen as a disturbing outsider trying to change a rather stable culture? May we see the story as the confrontation of an established social system by someone who persistently doesn't agree to follow its rules? In my opinion such a description is not the best one – and I have a very simple conjecture to put in making my point: should Sister Aloysius leave her position as the school's principal (instead of Father Flynn leaving his, as a priest in that parish), and soon the school's internal social climate would radically change. In other words, in Sister Aloysius' absence, the behaviors of fearful caution and secrecy that nuns and pupils have been showing will very quickly fade out, to everyone's relief. The strong impression that such a change would effectively happen is enough to show that we are not at the presence of a main cultural trait in a social system, but only of a pattern of response from everyone in the organization to the principal's attitudes: typically, her sick rigidity and obstinate righteousness. So, what we have here is just a terrible social climate created by a leadership style marked by a rather pathological severity.Therefore, he who eventually decides to use this film as an educational resource in a workshop about organizational behavior will probably not teach much about corporate culture, but will certainly teach a lot about leadership styles: Aloysius is an exceptional example of autocratic and coercive leadership, marked by rigidity and prejudice and eliciting in everybody deep feelings of fear and reserve. In her tortuous mind, she sees licentiousness where there is love, perversion where there is joy, and anarchy where there is pleasure. She represents an archaic and vicious kind of leadership that the Holy Church experimented for many and many years in the past, grounded on the punishing God of the Old Testament much more than on the Gospel's loving God.",Doubt
291,virtualcomputer,No Doubts Left UnTold,7,28 September 2009,"There is ""no Doubt"" that the performances turned in by Streep and Hoffman are outstanding. One should see this film, if for no other reason, but this alone.Set in the early 1960's at a Catholic school, the film (and play I presume) present a subtle and somewhat hidden tale that delivers very superficial hints at homosexuality, child sexual abuse by priests, the relevance of religion in modern culture, progressive vs conservative culture and religious dogma. All of this is tied up in a messy bow of a meandering narrative.As soon as the movie begins to develop a cogent point, it just as hastily veers off into another topic leaving the last unresolved. I gather this very well may be the point.While some could well argue that Streep's character's breakdown at the end of the movie is the climactic endpoint bring all the Doubts illuminated throughout the movie into one sharp point, I would rather suggest that it is less a point rather than a prism that breaks all the Doubts into a final array of unresolved Doubts.It is a good film and one that could lead naturally to a lot of follow-up discussion. I have to admit that I don't know whether I was truly satisfied at the end or just left with a nagging sense that I should have been given more in this film than just all the Doubts about many facets of this film.

292,gmsdoggies,Wonderful drama - transported me back to my own school days,10,31 January 2010,"I really enjoyed this film and it transported me back to my childhood as both my primary and secondary schooling were in convent schools in Northern Ireland between 1967 - 1980. Even though this school was set in the US the nuns seem to be molded from the same cloth and even though some other posters question the portrayal of Sister Aloysius as being a little over the top I would say that in my experience I have met quite a few nuns who were very similar to Sr Aloysius.I always felt that these sisters had to be silent in a male dominated society and they worked tirelessly to educate us in the all girls schools I went to and especially in the years from 1969 to 1980 when the troubles were at their heights in Northern Ireland.The headmistress of my secondary school was a very stern lady in a starched habit, with a square shaped veil, with her silver glasses perched on the end of her nose and which through she looked at us pupils with the sternest gaze which seemed to bore right through your soul. This nun also had a very staccato voice and we likened her speaking to us like a daleck (Dr. Who reference). This Sr. was especially frightening to younger school pupils but as the years went by and when myself and my other student friends had reached our senior years this nun showed her self to be dedicated, firm, fair and devoted to the school, the pupils and her convent.As I have already mentioned this was during the troubles in Northern Ireland and this nun tried to educate us and make us value ourselves and others. Some of my fellow pupils left school and became involved in the struggle and ended up in prison in Armagh Jail. During this time some Irish Republicans would not recognise the court when appearing before a judge particularly when it was a diplock court, this was a trial with only judges and no jury. Sometimes these young women would end up with lengthy sentences because they would turn their backs on the court.I know for a fact that this sister would visit these women in jail and would try to bring them comfort and pastoral care. This did not mean she approved of their involvement but she was still in a motherly way bringing them familiarity and trying to reach them.This sister is now deceased and I think of her and her kindness and I feel that our schools are not the same without these dedicated women who gave up their lives and followed their paths and lived their lives out looking after their pupils, schools and parishes.I also know that there were bad clergy but I have never experienced any negative Sisters or Priests in my life.Caroline Northern Ireland",Doubt
293,mickosaer,A rarity; excellent film totally reliant on story and character,8,24 December 2008,"It's such a refreshing experience to see a 21st Century film only 90mins long and shot on a moderate budget, but that has all the complexity and character intrigue of a Dostoyevskian masterpiece.The story is of a Priest (Phil Hoffman) suspected of 'improper behaviour' with a student at his Catholic school. Yet the real story is that his prosecutor (the always-outstanding Meryll Streep) is in no place to accuse, has no evidence - only here-say - to go on, and no real reason to stir up trouble. But stir she does.The film starts with a pre-emptive sermon on the liberating nature of doubt - to be able to question what you've been told when it conflicts with your instincts, and to guiltlessly challenge your beliefs. But this is at odds with the old-school style of obedience and fear that's instilled in the students, and is the underlying conflict between Hoffman and Streep's characters throughout the film. I won't go into the plot in too much detail, but the way the audience is forced to doubt every accusation and twist is a masterful compliment to the film's overriding theme, and a rare instance of an 'open' ending that doesn't frustrate. The film has made it's point.It is, if nothing else, brilliantly written. It's hard to tell if the film is critical of Catholicism's straight-line believers or sympathetic to it's well-meaning principles - but the grey area in between is delved into with gusto and asks questions of the characters that they are unable to answer. The film also touches upon themes of male-dominated hierarchy within the church (adding another layer to Streep and Hoffman's battle), racism in the classroom and domestic violence in the home with the lightest of touches, and never gives an easy answer.Besides the two lead performances, the acting across the board is outstanding (Amy Adams' patient and understated character is the only source of relief in a forceful script). Adapted from the stage, this film is primed for the powerhouse performances Streep and Hoffman are famed for, and they don't disappoint. Well worth watching for their exchanges alone.A certainty for consideration in the run-up to the Oscars, and a timely reminder that small films with big ideas are far more interesting and provocative than their blockbuster counterparts.",Doubt

He is confronted head on by rigid disciplinarian, Sister Aloysius, who almost is looking to get him thrown out for his liberal views, and especially his rather close relationship with their first black student. Although it is inferred that he may be having sexual relations with Donald, the young black boy, it is never proved. Father Flynn puts up a strong front and attempts to fight the stubborn sister, but backs off in the end and is transferred to another parish. The verbal hyperbole is fascinating and stimulating.

Doubt is a fine piece of work. Not since Closer has a play turned into movie been as rewarding an experience. Streep astonishes again. Her continued never-fail acting work is almost off-putting but she always lives within the character (with the possible jarring exception of Mamma Mia!) and her talent is undeniable, especially here. Amy Adams is 2nd best and surely deserves a shot at the Best Supporting Actress Oscar again (since she was snubbed for her sweet performance in Enchanted). Her quiet work opposite of Streep is astoundingly powerful in context to the film. Viola Davis (fantastic in Far From Heaven) is clearly a shoe-in for a nomination. Her part is too small, but even with her limited screen time her character alone is the center storm of the plot. And despite a distracting runny nose she is very effective. Hoffman is splendid and wisely makes the audience doubt Streeps judgement even though we feel we shouldn't. Doubt is well directed. It does not shy away from every-day character activity instead uses it to subtly whisper the story until it is necessary to scream, so to speak. However, Doubt could have afforded to be slightly more edgy. It was wise to create suspicion by not saying too much but I wouldn't mind my mind being played with a little more. The lead in to a great religious edge was the metaphor of the wind and how it was blowing in change. Much like the banishment of modernization. IE: the transister radio, the secular Christmas songs, etc. Despite its slightly shaved off sharp edge Doubt is one of the best movies of the year. It holds your attention the way a pot-boiler drama should. I can still hear Streeps powerful cry at the end of the movie even now. Doubt leaves the answers up to us.***1/2 out of ****",Doubt

Meryl Streep is the principal and a superb Amy Adams is a teacher who believe that Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is abusing a child. There is no proof but Streep has her certainty. While beautifully written, the director John Patrick Shanley allows many annoyances to distract the audience. For example, when Streep confronts Hoffman, the phone rings and does not stop. One interruption after another follows. This doesn't add to the drama but is just a distraction.

Well, in the movie Doubt we have Hollywood at its finest. The casting is perfect. Meryl Streep transforms herself into the antipathetic principal of the school, whom she plays so convincingly that we grind our teeth. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the sympathetic priest with a believability such that the drama between these two characters, thanks to an intelligent and engaging script, brings home to us the terrible consequences of uncharitableness. The clash between priest and principal in the principal's office is played superlatively by Streep and Hoffman. As to the supporting cast: With wide-eyed innocence, Amy Adams plays Sister James, who functions in the drama as the person of goodwill who struggles to find out what's what. Accolades also for Viola Davis, who plays the mother of the boy who's the victim of the struggle. Good acting and script need good cinematography to make a good movie. The opening shot shows a street in the bleak morning light. As a still it belongs in a museum for photography, as an establishing shot it sets the mood.

This picture has a thick plot line that few can intellectually grasp as we are devoid of attention society. The classic power struggle between Steep and Hoffman adds a WW1 trench warfare atmosphere and exposes the dysfunction of power within the catholic religion known for hiding felonious acts of indiscretion. This movie invokes the scam of religion, ethnic tension, male vs female power struggles in the 1960's, and the ponderment of evidence vs surface appearance to actual facts. The guilt, battlement, and pulling of Davis from one side to another leaves you with astound attention during this film. Doubt is the perfect name for this film and the reason I give it a 10.

Phillip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant as her match, giving a terrifyingly conflicted performance. Seeing these two face off is like watching a cage match. They have no need to carry the film on their own however, as Amy Adams, Viola Davis, and the various child actors go above and beyond in their supporting roles. The attention to the smallest detail in every scene is fantastic; every scene has a purpose for being there.The screenplay and the way it is performed by its actors is exhilarating to witness, I find more entertainment and excitement in it than most recent blockbusters.

But this movie, as I think, is not only about doubts of priests, but also is about doubts visiting every human being once in a while.The title of this movie perfectly reflects its essence. The film offers no answers, only raises questions and creates doubt. What would you do in this situation? What to do if you have a doubt absorb, but there is no evidence of your innocence or error? And as much as you may be assured of 100% right, sooner or later you will still be overtaken by doubt.And we can see a perfect illustration of that at the end of the movie when the protagonist's doubt translates into tears.So, what can be said about the movie as a whole. The setting is realistic. The acting is great. Meryl Streep is unmatched as a villain. A few minutes of watching and you have the urge to strangle her.What can I say - all the actors are amazing. Bravo to the director, the screenwriter and actors! I strongly recommend this movie to everyone.",Doubt
304,kirateterina,What role does doubt play in your life?,10,4 February 2018,"The film leaves a bright aftertaste after watching, and, like a juicy fruit, it remains to ripen, gathering more and more new associations with our life. Each time, involuntarily and unconsciously recalling this film, you realize that it is much deeper than it seems at the first blush. It's our reality full of doubts from top to bottom. 
We are so distrustful, so doubtful about the people around us, that this often only complicates our lives. It's simple to blame, much harder is to stop it and to realize the mistake, even if the doubt is unreasonable and not proven.
So it happened with Father Brendan Flynn, a priest, remarkably played by Philip Hoffmann. Sister Aloysius Beauvier suspected him of molesting one of his disciples, Donald Miller. Who knows whether was it or is it just guesses of a woman who believes that her sixth sense never fails her. Is it sincere care for the boy, who needs it like no other, or a nasty act of a man who took advantage of his own position? The ending of the film is constructed in such a way that the viewer decides on whose side he is by himself.
As for me, the innocence of Father Flynn is obvious. How can you blame a person for this, without good reason, only because of long nails and addiction to sugar? 
Although, while watching the film, scandalous cases of child molestation by Catholic priests come up in memory. In March 2011, in connection with the investigation of the case of molestation 21 priests in Philadelphia were removed from the services. However, I think that the fault of these priests has been fully proved by a lot of evidence and they were not accused only because of someone's baseless suspicions. Maybe that's why I remained on the side of Father Flynn.Especially I would like to note a brilliant playing of actors. Not for nothing, the actors playing the main roles were nominated for an Oscar and many awards. Particularly stunning for me is Meryl Streep. She was absolutely convincingly able to play a conservative Sister Aloysius Beauvier, convinced of her rightness. While watching the film, I believed the actress so much, that I even began to hate Sister Beauvier. Amy Adams remarkably created the image of a kind and slightly naive teacher, and Philip Hoffman - the image of a great orator and a good person.

While watching that film I felt doubts about the plot and its meaning. As for me the first part of the movie is forgotten immidiately, and it is not good. Because what's the point of watching then if you hardly remember what was at the beginning. Useless waste of time. 
As for the second part, it was rather confusing than interesting. Sister Aloysius was sure that Father Flynn did someting wrong according to religion, also Sister James tried to defend him. At the end Sister A got what she wanted, after that she had a talk with Sister J and suddenly confessed she had a doubt about all she did. 
On the other hand it makes you think that you should check everything before doing something or blame someone.
But the whole impression of this film was negative. It could be 30 minutes long, because some scenes were redundant and it hard to recall them.

The film turned out not boring, although very calm and sad. Everyone will find in the film something important for him/her and everyone will understand it in their own way.

315,evseeva_j,Great characters brought to life by great ensemble of actors.,10,5 February 2018,"Doubt is a wonderful drama film based on John Patrick Shanley's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Doubt: A Parable. Set in a Bronx Catholic school in the mid 1960s, Doubt explores the conflict between Sister Aloysius Beauvier, the strict and conservative principal of the school, and Father Brendan Flynn, a priest whom Sister Aloysius accuses of having sexual relationships with the school's first black student, Donald Miller. Doubt is all about faith, judgement, suspicion, and of course, doubt. The story is mostly told through dialogue. In some of the films that I've watched dialogues could really bore me to death, but the ones in Doubt never did. On the contrary, it was the dialogues that didn't allow me to take my eyes off the screen; it was the dialogues that with every word, every sentence, every scene made the characters more convincing and put a seed of doubt into my head.It's impossible to imagine a cast that would give a more powerful performance, connect with their characters and express such a great range of emotions any better that those four did. Meryl Streep. When this name just appears on the horizon, no further words are necessary. It speaks for itself and it says, 'Where there is Meryl Streep, there is perfection and power'. Philip Seymour Hoffman is incredible. The scenes between the two of them are thrilling, their emotional fight is riveting. Amy Adams wonderfully portrays a naive and childlike adult. Viola Davis is only in one scene (as the boy's mother, Mrs Miller), but it doesn't stop her from giving a strong and touching performance. I waited for her to appear in more scenes because it wasn't enough for me but, obviously, I have to witness her incredible talent on How to Get Away with Murder.The scenery, generally dark and uninviting, matches the general mood of the film and adds to its tense and gloomy atmosphere. Even the ringing phone adds tension. But what I liked is that the story allows some breaks from the seriousness of the subject matter. When Sister James, for example, declares her love of Frosty the Snowman, you can't but smile, or when the students learn to dance, you start tapping your foot to the rhythm and for a minute forget about the main conflict. What's interesting is that not only Meryl Streep's character has doubts when the matter seems to be solved, but we are also left in doubt after watching this film. We don't know for sure why Sister Aloysius wants so desperately to get rid of Father Flynn (perhaps, she despises him for being so progressive or she just wants to protect the student), as well as we have no proof that Father Flynn is actually guilty. And this kind of an open ending allows us to think about and dwell on that, to find out if doubt is a part of our nature and what it does to us. Not many films in today's film industry give us such an opportunity, so we should thank John Patrick Shanley, the director of this amazing film, for that.Don't doubt whether you must watch this film or not.

317,atera-70845,It is only our decision to dispel the doubts or not.,8,4 February 2018,"Doubt. The thing that can ruin our life or can rescue from the things or people who can ruin us in a more cruel way. The movie ""Doubt"" is a 2008 American period drama film written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, who puts the notion of the ""doubt"" in the center of this drama. The first time when the director introduces the main theme of his movie, happens during the sermon of Father Flynn. Doubt has become an important issue across the USA and in the American churches from the last mid century due to the several reasons. After the assassination of Kennedy and the beginning of the war in Vietnam, doubt had undermined American certainty in general. The problem laid in the fact that the doubt infiltrated into the most sacred place - the church. In 1976 numerous Roman Catholic priests were accused of the systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area. The biographical drama film ""Spotlight"" touches upon the question of child molestation as well as John Patrick Shanley's ""Doubt"". Oscar-winning Meryl Streep as Sister Aloysius with Sister James have the doubt that Father Flynn might have too much personal attention with the school's only black student Donald Miller. This distrust for Sister Aloysius turns into the persecution of Flynn and his subsequent resignation. In order to understand the main idea of this movie we should think about the notion of a doubt. ""Doubt"" is not intended as a docudrama about possible sexual abuse, it is the work that helps us to conduct the introspection of our feelings and thoughts. Sister Aloysius surely has doubts about Father Flynn, but also she has doubts about herself. She saw life in the black and white colors. She knew that ballpoint pens, long nails and hair pins are evil in the walls of church, and the faith in God was the salvation. Everything changed when she faced her doubt. ""I have doubts. Such strong Doubts!"" - Sister Aloysius screams. It was the very moment when she saw the world in the gray color. The was no any white or black shade - now she is not sure about Flynn's blame and that is more important she is not sure about her own faith in people. 
""Doubt"" is terrific, it gives us the opportunity to analyze not the concept of the abuse or the feeling of blame, but to analyze the psychology of people. While watching I wanted to find out whether Flynn was guilty or not, now my doubts will not allow me to answer this question. We remember this key phrase ""Resignation in his confession"" - probably resignation can prove the fact of child molestation. But it is only our decision to dispel the doubts or not.",Doubt

This film is full of sensible dialogues with draw you attention and make you analyze every word. The back ground is very important and impressive here, the strong wind, pouring rain, thunderstruck, the bulb that switches off at very emotional scenes. All these attracted me so much during the film and they added a lot of hidden message to the film. 
The film itself is very calm, there is no action, no bright and colorful landscapes no crazy changes of events, but the whole film I could feel this tension and concentration on words, actions even faces themselves because they showed e lot of feelings without words. And, of course, the acting of Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman is impressive. They manages to feel their part so well that I really believed them in the film. 
The directing of the film is perfect. I felt as if it is a story told by someone. The changing of the events, the landscape, and settings helped to show the idea of the film. The director of the film, John Patrick Shanley, visited himself the parish school where some part of the film were filmed, so? Of course, it adds the authenticity to the whole picture of the film. The film flew slowly from one scene to another. The colors in the scenes are very soft, but a bit cold and gloomy. We could not see a lot of sun during the movie what definitely support the main word in the film - doubt. 
The most impressive in this film for me personally is that the title is ""Doubt"", the main idea is being doubt about some actions of the character in the film and that the review is left with thiss feeling after watching. We are absolutely unsure about the truth in the film and it is up to the person to choose the truth.

The person without doubts looks like Sister Aloysius Beauvier. The performance by Meryl Streep is brilliant. She is a nun very strict about the discipline.The nun suspects the priest of close relationship with one of the students. The suspicion will never be confirmed, because there is no real prove. 
During this film I was on the Sister's side because she talked so persuasively, that it was hard not to be influenced by such a strong personality. And our role of spectators is played in the movie by Sister James, a younger nun who is trying to understand what really is. So later we see her change of mind and finally it is up to us to decide who was wrong and who was right.

A tricky situation happens with the modern pastor in one of the non-secular schools with a convervative head teaher. The reputation of the priest must be pure, according to the rules of Church but not today. All the events of the movie develop in such a way that the sypathy of the viewer is on the side of pastor and it is not clear up to the end who is right or guilty.
Be tolerant and patient even if you become witness of others sin. Eventually, it is out of your business and it doesn't personally concern you... But the sister Heloise, the director of Catholic school, looks hysterical, uncompromising and stubborn after leaning some secret information.An image of the typical chief-nun, old maid is created.
And pastor is on the contrary: consists only from merits, favourite children's teacher, and everybody's sympathy is on his side, his fault doesn't find the sufficient bases. Even ""the fury"" couldn't stand this impact, though achieving the aim. But in heart there is doubt.
The aim of the movie is to seed doubt in the mind if the viewer. And it is achieved. The only question is ""What is the purpose of this doubt?"". The movie is all about the game of emotions.

This film is definitely relevant for all time. The main idea of this film is doubt. Every day, every person doubts something. It may concern small things. For example, a person may doubt whether to go somewhere or not, eat for a healthy breakfast or harmful. Also, doubts overwhelm us in the most difficult moments of our life. We doubt whether we should make a choice in one direction or in another, because our choice can change both our lives and the life of another person. Doubts surround us everywhere. The film ""Doubt"" has caused me a lot of different emotions, from laughing in funny moments, to deep sadness and reflection at the end of the film. This film, I believe, applies to each of us, everyone can try on a character from the movie.
In the center of the plot is the directress of a closed church school. Her name is Eloise, whose role was played by Meryl Streep. This heroine is the woman, who keeps the whole school in fear, everyone is afraid of her. This woman is devoted to God and her principles. Father Flynn is in her submission. His role was played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. This character is revealed to us as a very kind, sincere person, who loves and understands wards children. One day, one of the sisters witnesses a situation that casts doubt on Flynn's reputation. The sister tells about it to the headmistress. From this moment the film turns into a drama, which keeps in continuous tension to the very titles.
All the funny moments that can cause laughter among viewers, occur at the very beginning of the film. Virtually all actions and behavior of the directress are so demonstratively designed to observe the order and rules of human existence, which involuntarily cause a smile. The moment when all the sisters dine in silence, and Sister Eloise watches everyone's meal and controls every piece of food, was especially memorable. Father Flynn has caused me only kind, positive emotions, and great pity for him at the end. The film does not disclose all the cards, does not tell what exactly this story ends, leaves the viewer to think up and solve it for himself. We cannot be sure exactly who is guilty, and who is right. 
Sad music and gray-brown tones, in which the film is shot, only strengthen the effect of drama.
I definitely can recommend this movie for viewing. I believe that we definitely have to watch films that make us think about something. From this film, I took for myself the next main idea - you should always think about aftermath of your choice and about aftermath of your decision, how they will affect not only you, but also the lives of others, not to regret the deed for the rest of your life.",Doubt
322,lullaby-84090,"""There is nothing wrong with love""",8,4 February 2018,"In the center of the plot lies the confrontation of a devoted Catholic school female principal and a priest who seems to have ""improper relations"" with a student. Though religion is the central theme of the story, it is only the background with the help of which the movie actually raises a few very important fundamental questions about the human nature. Faith. Doubt. Compassion. Love. Can we trust our own inner feelings or shall we rely only on prescribed morality, be it religious beliefs, social rules and norms or something else? The main characters of the movie present two different poles, two different answers to the questions. On the surface, the answers may seem obvious and simple. Speaking during sermons is bad. Listening to music during lessons is inappropriate. Singing secular songs at a church school is strange. Close relations between a priest and a boy are suspicious. But the movie proves once again that it is not so easy to tell good from bad.Was Father Flynn a good person? Did he really care about the boy? Questions about his nature, intentions and actions were left unanswered in the movie. But whatever he has done, the boy's tears after his resignation can tell us something. Yes, there could happen things that at first sight seem damaging, but was the final outcome good for the boy? Nobody had cared about him before, and Father Flynn seemed to be the only person who could protect him. And now he again has nothing. Though of course I also have doubts about the Father Flynn's good nature.But still, is Sister Aloysius's approach better? She is very tough and strict with the students, she expects only discipline and obedience from them, she seems to show nearly no real compassion and humaneness. And she is sure that she knows what to do. She seems to be sure. But what do we see in the end? Like any other human being, she admits that she has doubts. Did she have doubts only about the fact that Father Flynn did something bad to the boy or did she have doubts about this ""bad""? Was it bad? What is bad?For me the movie is really thought-provoking. I shall add that the settings and the picture are very sophisticated and very beautiful from the aesthetic point of view. Scenes with strong wind, heavy rains and storms contributed very much to a tense atmosphere of the movie. I admired that many things were not said directly, and Father Flynn's sermons played a big role in it. Actually his three sermons divide the narration into 3 parts and go together with the dramatic development of the story and it is also an interesting trick. 
But the ideas raised in the movie are the most remarkable. Certainly worth watching.8 out of 10",Doubt
323,zelman-26786,Strange feelings,7,4 February 2018,"Doubt is a 2008 American period drama film written and directed by John Patrick Shanley based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning stage play Doubt: A Parable. Produced by Scott Rudin, the film takes place in a St. Nicholas school led by Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep). Sister James (Amy Adams) tells Aloysius that Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) might have too much personal attention with the school's only black student Donald Miller (Joseph Foster), thus leading to Aloysius starting a crusade against Flynn. The film also stars Viola Davis as Donald Miller's mother, Mrs. Miller.
The entitled ""doubt"" was not about Father Flynn's guilt (which I believe becomes apparent toward the end of the film).
 The ""doubt"" is manifested in Sister Aloysius as she comes to doubt the institution of the Catholic Church she has devoted her life to.Instead of getting rid of the priest, the church covers up the crime and promotes him to pastor a more thriving parish. I think that would be enough to cause anyone to have ""doubts"".
The main event of the film is sexual abuse but nobody knows exactly it is true or false. All the film we listen to the discussions of the main characters. In my opinion it is morally-deeped in sense film. It is important to listen to all the phrases because almost each of them has the key meaning inside. Durring the film I always felt tension because of constant confrontation between Sister Aloysius and Fathet Flynn. Sister James is middle link. All the event and discussions are around them. They try to identify the truth.In my opinion, the film i really monotonous , at the same level of tension. 
I liked the settings an costumes that successfully helped create the atmosphere of that time. In the end of the film I had strange mixed feelings. Niw thinking about it , I can say that it was relly good, thought-povoking film, even intereting.

324,elenaleader,"""There is nothing wrong with love""",7,5 February 2018,"I am absolutely impressed with the way my brain is organized. Faith is a very meticulous issue for me. I try to avoid this subject in real life communication. When it comes to movies and TV series about belief and religion, I just can't withstand the desire to watch it. Doubt, both directed and written by John Patrick Snanley, depicts the situation happening in the parish school, where a rigorous principal, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), together with a young teacher, Sister James (Amy Adams), are starting a crusade against Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) whom they beleive might have close relationship with one of the students.The movie begins with Father Flynn (Hoffman) delievering a sermon about doubt. This monologue reveals the main message of the movie.
""Doubt can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty""
So, the audience is given the answer to the riddle just from the start and our aim is just to follow the autthor's and director's storyline and see how far it will go.I can't but pay a great respect to the actors starring in the movie. Meryl Streep did a marvelous job potraying a very dubious character. Her acting was convincing enough to leave no doubt in my heart. I am not much of Amy Adams' lover, but I did enjoy her in this movie. I was deeply impressed with the way she uses facial expression to expose her emotions. The scene of the dinner, where Sister Beauvier (Meryl Streep) and Sister James (Amy Adams) interract without any words, is a good example of two talented actresses showing there capacity to uncover their feelings without verbal communication. I was also fascinated with the starring of Philip Hoffman as Father Flynn. I think he did what he was supposed to, (spolier alert!) he practically made us fall into doubt about him being involved in a relationship with the boy. 
But most of all I was smitten with the acting of magnificent Viola Davis. Being a huge fan of her in TV series ""How To Get Away With Murder"", I wasn't surprised by her outstanding but short performance in this movie. She makes us believe every word she produces. She makes us sympathize with her. She makes us understand what she is trying to say. She makes us doubt. 
Two scenes. 10 minutes on the screen. And such a great impact.Everything that is connected with director work is perfect. Slow movies are precious. Such films let you sneak into every little detail and give you plenty of time to contemplate. Scenes when the camera is still. Perfect. Long monologues. Perfect. No further quesion, Your Honor, John Shanley.Overall, this is a great movie that leaves no one without his ot her personal opinion. The main question remains unanswered, unsolved, covered with mystery. It's up to us to decide whether to blame the person, to sympathize with him or to stay on neutral side.

And you have no slightest idea of which one it's going to choose next.",Doubt
325,gorelova,Doubt,7,5 February 2018,"How good is Doubt? To my mind the film is pretty good. But to be honest, I don't like such films where church is taken as a whole scene. I have no connections to the Catholic Church and the plot is too slow developed. 
The film takes place in a St. Nicholas school led by Sister Aloysius. At the very beginning of the film Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) preaches a sermon to his congregation in which he asks the question, ""What do you do when you're not sure?"" There are two answers to this question. You could acknowledge doubt, exploring it as best you can, accept that there may be things we can never know, and live with the ambiguity that so often is a characteristic of human life. Or you could retreat into a dogmatic certainty, suppressing any doubts, and act forcefully to live as though your understanding is the absolute truth - sometimes wreaking great evil in the process. This choice between certainty and doubt is a central theme of the film. 
At the center of modest setting is a duet play of two outstanding actors Meryl Streep and Philip Hoffman. They are capable of creating persuasive characters with no make-up and unchanging clothes. The scenes between them are thrilling and catching from start to finish. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always good and he is in the centre of the events which are happened in the film. He looks like an ordinary priest; however Sister Aloysius accuses him in having strange relationships with one of the students. Their acting is shaded by a sweet and naive Sister James by Amy Adams. Like an audience she reflects our own misgivings from one strong figure to another. Her love and need for simplicity is heartbreaking. And Viola Davis as a mother of a trouble boy performs a powerful and painful monologue which sheds some light on the matter but still doesn't offer an easy solution. 
I consider if there is more than one setting (church), the film will be more interesting and eye-catching. The actors are quite good but the plot is rather strange. There are no actions, dynamics, only annoying jump from loud music and conversations to silence. 
I think I should watch it again to get the whole picture and understand it thoroughly. When you watch a film several times, you always find something new. I recommend this film to grown up people.",Doubt

A crusade against Father Flynn is held after Sister tells Aloysius that Father Flynn might have too much personal attention with the school's only black student. Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman did fantastic job playing their leading roles in ""Doubt"".
 Although being very much on point regarding the social issues faced by America in 1960-s - especially racism, this film may turn out to be too monotonous for some people who enjoy action more than the exercising of wit and charisma.

And this movie showed us one concrete decision of one person.The movie is philosophical, It shows how people influence lifes of each other motivated only by some inside things. How can we decide for other people when we don't have any proofs? This question was the main one in my head after watching this movie. 
This movie made me think of influence on other people more than of doubts. All people doubt I think. We have the reasons for it because we have so many variants in life. But not all people show it. This is an example of some personal desire to prove the idea you have (I'm talking about Aloysius). Many sides of a person are shown in this movie and it's good to see and think of yourself. After watching it I had many questions to myself. 
I would recomend this movie to people who want to find questions but not answers. Personally for me I can't answer if Aloysius was right or not. And I can't answer some personal questions after it as well.",Doubt
328,laalmadeguerra,Doubt is a doubt,8,11 March 2018,"In 1964 Father Flynn, a parish priest in a Catholic church in the Bronx, reads a sermon about doubt and its unifying power - because everyone doubts. Soon he will have to test his theses in practice. The parish school where he teaches is dominated by stern Sister Aloysius. The suspicion is that Father Flynn, a kindhearted humanist with too long nails, is in an immoral-intimate relationships with the only Afro-American and the first Afro-American pupil of the school, runs his Sister Aloysius to action. Sister Aloysius doesn't have any evidence but is not doubt a burden that any person who chooses an action for the glory of his ideals should bear? 
The action takes place in autumn and winter and the weather we see outside (grey skies, a thunderstorm, snow) seems to reflect the characters' emotions. Although the film is set in the sixties, the style of decor of the rooms, and most of the furniture, suggests a date several decades before that, adding to the atmosphere of intellectual conservatism.
The theme of doubt runs through the film. It opens with Father Flynn giving a sermon on the nature of doubt and concluding that like faith, it can be a unifying force. It ends, after Flynn has been forced to resign, with Aloysius admitting in tears to Sister James, ""I have such doubts"". I was disappointed by the ending which seems too abrupt and does not clarify the nature of Aloysius's doubts. Did she mean doubts about her faith in general, or doubts about Flynn's guilt? Or doubts about the justice of a God who can allow a guilty man to go unpunished? (After the resignation Flynn was transferred by the Church authorities to another, more prestigious, parish; effect a promotion). It is certainly true that in some cases an outward view of certainty can hide inner doubts and conflicts, but as Aloysius has still appeared a person of firm convictions, untroubled by doubts of any kind, this sudden, unexplained revelation comes as a shock. 
The movie's biggest strength is the acting. All three leading actors did a fine job and this was necessary to carry a film that has no special effects, explosions or love scenes. The vagueness of the film is also a strength. After all, the film gets the audience thinking and yet there is definitely no clear answer as to what really occurred in the film. There is lots of room to foster discussions and debate. As usual, Meryl Streep eclipsed everyone and everything with her unlimited talent. She really succeeded in acting the role of a strong-willed women. But Philip Seymour Hoffman also played very emotionally. The episode in the office where the two opponents grabbed in a verbal battle made a great impression on me. I was delighted with their play very much. Viola Davis appeared only for a few minutes, but showed a drama that many actresses will not play in their entire life. And Amy Adams is very convincing in the image of a naive and meek sister. In general, excellent actors, a good story and a pleasant film that leaves an aftertaste. 
""Doubt"" is a doubt as it did not give us an answer to the question: Who was ultimately wrong? And we do not understand who is ""bad"". Is it the priest with greasy eyes, who, nevertheless, is truly appreciated and respected by the downtrodden boy? Is it the nun who embodies righteousness in its pure form and at the same time confesses that her soul is not at all pure? And who is ""good""? Let the viewer decide.",Doubt

And doubt again. Does the question of any right to maim the lives of others, if it is baseless and unsubstantiated? 
""Doubt""is a film by American Director John Patrick Shanley. The atmosphere of the film nervously suspicious, there are many doubts. Black-brown, dark, almost no bright colors. The story is about a headmistress of the closed Church school, Eloise (Meryl Streep), a woman devoted to the Lord and his principles. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), is a man with a questionable, but not a sinful past, a loving and understanding children. 
The action takes place in 1964 in the United States. The new pastor of the Church, is a teacher in the school at the Church, father Flynn with all his progressive vision about a new Church, close to the people, makes the headmaster look at him with caution, with a certain distrust. The themes of his sermons sometimes had a strange subtext! Once, one of the sisters becomes a witness to a situation that casts doubt on the reputation of father Flynn. From this moment the quiet film turns into an acute psychological drama that keeps in tension until the credits roll. Throughout the movie Eloise lost in a vague doubt, suspecting father Flynn, the priest at the school, in the depraved actions with the only black student of the school. She doesn't share her suspicions directly, but severely punishes all school teachers to report any oddities in the attitude of the priest. She goes too far with her suspicions, without a single evidence strongly believes in the guilt of father Flynn. Young and naive sister James looks completely confused, she didn't know what to believe. The saddest thing is that all of these events come from good intentions, evil must be punished, but does it? Fascinated, sister Eloise had forgotten that any doubt has two options, and only one of them is correct, but what? Fifty-fifty. The priest in the end cannot withstand such pressure and voluntarily leave the school. And only after a certain time after that, sister Eloise confesses to sister James that she had no evidence against the priest, and again her heart's not in it, and whether it was received... In fact, the denouement of the film still remains a mystery. Was father Flynn guilty or not - it is not clear, the Director has left us his own question - what do you think? Who is right and who is wrong? We have to find out the answer to this question...

331,ddianchiikk,""" I Have Doubts, Such Strong Doubts!""",10,23 April 2018,"It's just a wonderful movie with a deep meaning! Without loud words and direct speeches, the whole situation in the film is clear to us. Amazing acting by nearly everyone in the cast. 
The whole story is filled with twists and turns and painful moral questions. One minute, you belive the priest, the next, the nun. What is most disturbing, however, is the lack of proof to either side. As its title announces, ""Doubt"" isn't about certainty, but ambiguity.
""Doubt,"" John Patrick Shanley's movie tackles the subject of pedophilia and paranoia in the Catholic Church.
In 1964 at St. Nicholas in the Bronx, two characters faced.
On one side is Sister Aloysius, an advocate of tradition and rigid authoritarianism, she stands firmly against change.
 Certainly the school's first black student, Donald , attracts her attention and becomes a victim.
On the other side is a charismatic, youthful priest, Father Flynn, who rides on the winds of change. He favors a more open and friendly rapport with students that recognizes emotional needs, not just academic ones. As played by Hoffman, an actor seems friendly and reliable.
My most favorite moment is a comparison of gossips with a ripped pillow, that all feathers will fly around the city and they will never be assembled.
It is a powerful movie about a catholic priest and a black boy that get close to each other, throughout the movie you never hear the words rape'' or pedophilia'' .
But from the way the story is being told and from Meryl Streeps character you understand what is going on, however this may not be the case hence the title 'Doubt', you aren't given a proper answer to the accusations which in all honestly could be false.
"" I Have Doubts, Such Strong Doubts!"" What a powerful ending, I loved the way it ended, I love that the Nun was questioning everything she believed in.
The heavy moral themes, racism, deep looks into Catholic morality, and complex relationships make this film very deep and it is not for everyone.",Doubt
332,anufrieva_nastya,Doubt 2008,7,23 April 2018,"In 1964 the winds of change are sweeping through Sister Aloysius' (Meryl Streep) St. Nicholas school. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a charismatic priest, is advocating reform of the school's strict customs, and the first black student has just been accepted. When a fellow nun (Amy Adams) tells Sister Aloysius that Father Flynn may be paying too much personal attention to the student, Sister Aloysius begins a personal crusade against the priest -- despite her lack of evidence. 
A Catholic grade school could seem like a hermetically sealed world in 1964. That's the case with St. Nicholas in the Bronx, ruled by the pathologically severe principal Sister Aloysius, who keeps the students and nuns under her thumb and is engaged in an undeclared war with the new parish priest. Their issues may seem to center around the reforms of Vatican II, then still under way, with Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as the progressive, but for the nun I believe it's more of a power struggle. The pope's infallibility seems, in her case, to have descended to the parish level.
Some will say the character of Sister Aloysius, played without a hint of humor . 
Sister Aloysius of ""Doubt"" hates all inroads of the modern world, including ballpoint pens. This is accurate. We practiced our penmanship with fountain pens, carefully heading every page ""JMJ"" -- for Jesus, Mary and Joseph, of course. Under Aloysius' command is the sweet young Sister James, whose experience in the world seems limited to what she sees out the convent window. Gradually during the autumn semester, the situation develops.
There is one African-American student at St. Nicholas, Donald Miller, and Father Flynn encourages him in sports and appoints him as an altar boy. This is all proper. Then Sister James notes that the priest summons the boy to the rectory alone. She decides this is improper behavior, and informs Aloysius, whose eyes narrow like a beast of prey. Father Flynn's fate is sealed.
But ""Doubt"" is not intended as a docudrama about possible sexual abuse. It is about the title word, doubt, in a world of certainty. For Aloysius, Flynn is certainly guilty. That the priest seems innocent, that Sister James comes to believe she was mistaken in her suspicions, means nothing. Flynn knows a breath of scandal would destroy his career. And that is the three-way standoff we watch unfolding with precision and tension.
Something else happens. Donald's mother fears her son will be expelled from the school. He has been accused of drinking the altar wine. Worse, of being given it by Father Flynn. She appeals directly to Sister Aloysius. It lasts about 10 minutes, but it is the emotional heart and soul of ""Doubt"". 
Doubt. It is the subject of the sermon Father Flynn opens the film with. Doubt was coming into the church and the United States in 1964. After the assassination of Kennedy and the beginnings of Vietnam, doubt had undermined American certainty in general. What could you be sure of? What were the circumstances? The motives? The conflict between Aloysius and Flynn is the conflict between old and new, between status and change, between infallibility and uncertainty. And Shanley leaves us doubting. ""Doubt"" has exact and merciless writing, powerful performances and timeless relevance. It causes us to start thinking with the first shot, and we never stop. Think how rare that is in a film.
I came to a different conclusion seeing this film. The entitled ""doubt"" was not about Father Flynn's guilt (which I believe becomes apparent toward the end of the film). The ""doubt"" is manifested in Sister Aloysius as she comes to doubt the institution of the Catholic Church she has devoted her life to. Instead of getting rid of the priest, the church covers up the crime. I think that would be enough to cause anyone to have ""doubts"". This was the last straw that caused this nun to have an emotional break down, reducing a once rigid woman certain in her beliefs to a sobbing and lost wreck of a human being.
To answer the obvious mystery in the film - whether Father had some sinful (or criminal) relationship with a twelve year boy? The one word answer on the platter is 'Yes'. I don't think the plot of this movie made a lot of sense for its 1964 setting. Would a nun in 1964 really suspect a priest of sexual abuse based on nothing more than a shirt being placed in a locker? In 2018, after two decades of priest abuse stories in the media, sure; however, in 1964, at a time when no one would dare criticize a man of the cloth, I have my doubts. Either way, I did enjoy the film and thought it was well-acted.",Doubt
333,wikanet,"Nobody is perfect, no one is absolute",4,2 May 2018,"As far as I understand, this film is mainly about the fact that it is our human weaknesses that make us human. And in the end the character Meryl Streep - Sister Aloysius - ""grows"" from the standard, the embodiment of righteousness and rightness, the only true measure of absolute good and absolute evil into something ""living"", not ideal, not absolutely true, something doubting. But I enclosed the word ""grows"" in quotes not accidentally. After all, an open ending actually kills this idea.
I can't say that I liked the movie. All the main characters are the classic of the stamp. Padre - of course, all such a caring, sensitive uncle, over-taking care of boys. And the most important circumstance that causes suspicion is long clean nails. Exactly these circumstances can't but undermine the confidence in his Holiness.
The next classic hero is a conservative guardian of the rules; she is a strict teacher; she's Meryl Streep. Well, necessarily in every story there is a wicked witch, and everyone obeys her unquestioningly and terribly afraid of her.
In contrast, there must be its complete opposite. This is a quiet, meek, naive sister, James, who faithfully believes in everything. Just an angel who descended from heaven.
What we have is a suspicion of Flynn's father who drags the whole film without any hint of truth or lies. This work is more suitable for the stage, for the theater with its pathos, with lively emotions, with an element of participation. Moving his own play to the screen, the director turned the characters into walking dolls, stuffed with clichés and stamps. Instead of speaking openly and without subterfuge, the pastor and sister, speaking in a language of virtue that is incomprehensible to modern man.

The idea is to show how differently people live through the period of doubt, when they have only suspections but no evidence. The actors' play is so realistic, that while watching the film you can't but take the position of one of them, as the film goes. But only in the end we also have doubts and have to choose whom to trust, because no truth is said, the ending is open. 
After watching this film you feel troubled, there're so many questions and no evident answers. The atmosphere of the film coincides with the inner state of characters and viewers, it's dark, windy, oppressing.
I didn't like neither the character nor the play of Amy Adams, in my opinion she's too meek, she can't choose whom to believe and her role in the story isn't very clear.
In general, the film is intriguing, you need to watch it very attentively, catching all the changes of the characters' thoughts and emotions, though it's not really psychologically comfortable to watch oppressing films like this one.",Doubt

Philip Seymour Hoffman did a pretty decent job, although barely any sexual energy was felt between him & the boy in question.

Playgoers have to put their imaginations to work if they're going to make sense out of what they're seeing on stage, and that was especially true here. Of course, no one could make a movie set in an elementary school without showing the kids; it would look ridiculous. Nevertheless, the kids got on my nerves. They looked too small to be in the eighth grade for one thing. Full disclosure here: I attended Catholic schools for sixteen years, except for kindergarten and graduate school. Philip Seymour Hoffman, for all his excellence, didn't convince me. Bryan F. O'Byrne, the Broadway Father Flynn, conveyed the inner torture of someone who struggled with impulses, and was trying to cover up a past he wasn't necessarily proud of. I didn't feel cheated out of the money or time I spent on this movie, and those who never saw the play should enjoy the actors' duel between Hoffman and Streep.",Doubt
337,ailtorres,Why did they make this movie?,2,24 January 2010,"I am not one of those people that will walk out of a movie that was based on source material and automatically say, ""The book was better."" I know better than to demote the value of a movie just because it wasn't a faithful adaptation. There is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the director's/editor's/cinematographer's/producer's control and certainly out of the original author's control. Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect a movie to be exactly the same, word for word, as a book or play or video game or Disneyland Ride, or whatever! A movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society. Moreover, a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and, if it is based on source material, its relevance needs to be reexamined and enhanced by the filmmakers. Films like There Will Be Blood follow this paradigm because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century, Oil!, it feels relevant because of things like the Iraq war and energy concerns that the film's country of origin, the US, was and is experiencing. Even King Kong, based on the original film, benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people have.With that said, I just don't understand why they even bothered to make this movie? Besides the great performances, guaranteed Oscar nods and Shanley's director/writers fee and royalties he will get, this movie seems to come from nowhere. It should have simply stayed as a play. The movie (which is essentially the same as the play) says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the Catholic church here and abroad. It says nothing new or different than the original play. I can't help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time: Frost/Nixon, which was also based on a play. Frost/Nixon, while about Nixon's regrets, seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when President Bush was about to leave office. The regrets that Nixon had, as depicted in the play/movie, about the war and his presidency could just as easily reflected on Bush and his presidency. In that respect Frost/Nixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo in the country at the time. In contrast, Doubt felt like it was yesterday's news and didn't seem to offer anything that the play didn't offer.Of course the movie is ""good,"" the performances are outstanding, and the screenplay adaptation is apt, but so what? Why didn't it just stay as a play? Why, besides marketing and financial reasons, make it into a movie? It gave audiences nothing new to discus about the awful subject.",Doubt

But what was the point of those weird angles, looking up at the actors' chins? They were jarring and not in sync with the dialogue. Were they to tell us that things are not as they seem? If so, then why were the most emotional scenes shot in a very conventional manner? Great writing, but Sister Streep's last line threw the whole story into the garbuerator. It ruined the movie for me.As for the debate about ""did he or didn't he?,"" to me it's clear he (Father Hoffman) did. Sister Streep asks him a direct question: tell us, get it out in the open, what happened? He responds not with the truth but by asking HER a question. To which she should have said, ""Stop evading the issue. What happened? If you have done nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide. But by hiding you are acknowledging you did something wrong."" But instead the movie takes a left turn, with Sister Streep crying unbelievable tears and Father Hoffman pleading that he's only human. Human sinfulness is not the issue. The issue is, did HE sin with the black boy, or didn't he? Skirting the issue tells me he did, sort of like A-Rod's bungled steroid confession forty-five years later.The clincher: when the Father says his goodbyes, the camera does a close-up on the Bad Boy's face.

The film centers on Sister Aloysius, a domineering nun in charge of St. Nicholas School, while the parish is run by Father Flynn. The central question boils down to ""Did he or didn't he?"", but the film contains such powerful themes the final answer pales in comparison to the reasons for asking the question. Streep's icy Sister Aloysius represents what screen villains should be: three-dimensional, highly motivated and obsessive. Hoffman turns Flynn into a truly ambiguous character. My only fault with the film lies with Amy Adams' Sister James. Personally, I feel no human can possibly be as cheery as Adams. Such cheeriness rendered Sister James into a manipulated character. However, it may simply be a personal fault against Adams.Shanley's direction of the opening thirty or so minutes was incredibly inspired. The remaining hour revealed great performances, but the feeling of watching a stage play sadly returned to the film. Had Shanley maintained the feeling of film, this would be one of my favorite movies of the year.",Doubt
344,Privet_Tarkovsky,A work of art with superb actors!,9,24 March 2017,"A mind-boggling roller coaster of corrupting human belief systems and corrosive social structures. Rhetorics, human relations, guilt, peer pressure, sexuality, religion, the willingness to suffer for piety, the persecution of the ill-fitting...and even a hint of metaphysics. This movie glued my brain to the screen. Its script is cunning, insidious and resourceful. Emotions and ratio collide when watching this film. The acting of Streep and Seymour-Hoffman is cutting edge, the tension between their characters tangible. Last but certainly not least, Viola Davis character is well-played and so realistic that I fell silent after her scene with Streep. I had to stop the movie to process the implication of the words her character utters.

345,stephen_burns,Doubt,9,25 January 2009,"This movie was captivating to say the least! Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymour-Hoffman were engaging adversaries both accurately capturing the huge emotions which encompass the plot. I have a completely different view to that expressed already. I don't believe Sister Aloysius had the purest of intentions in support of her actions. I don't believe she had even the best of intentions for her students - none of her interactions with them confirmed this. She came across as a severe and unloving principal who sought only to keep her students in a dutiful, obedient and unquestioning line.I believe there was a deeper emotion below the obvious battle of egos between Sister Aloysius and Father Brendan Flynn. In the first scenes Sister Aloysis is pictured taking in his sermon on Doubt. It seemed to me that Father Flynn had accurately captured the core of religious fears of the faithful in this sermon. This was demonstrated by the attentiveness of his congregation and the emotion shown on the faces of those listening. I believe Sister Aloysius felt negatively challenged by what he had to say. I believe she had pushed her fears about her faith deep down and his words to the gathered threatened her - they were being scraped open. So because she felt this occurring she made an unconscious decision to discredit him - to bring this tall poppy down. The lamb to the slaughter was Sister James  she presented Sister Aloysius with the means to achieve her aims. The Priest wouldn't conform to her understanding of her faith, and she not only resented his freedom over her nuns, but also generally the power that men held over women in those times. The suggestion made in the film that something unacceptable was occurring gave her the ammunition she needed to shoot him down  because he had unwittingly opened up her personal ""can of worms"". She presented him with a fabricated investigation and then convinced herself, of something she needed to believe to make the end justify her means. She sited his decision in the light of this, as proof of his guilt  but the final scene shows her Doubt - of herself - her actions, her motives and finally - her faith. Who was the winner in this?",Doubt
346,stephmil_22,Expert acting and portrayal of story,8,29 September 2012,"Doubt is a story about a baseless accusation of an inappropriate relationship with a priest and student overlaid with the issues of the post Vatican II movement of the Catholic Church. The setting is a Catholic Church school in the 1960's. A place of God should be a safe haven for children to grow and develop relatively normal lies. Yet, the winds of change are coming on as quickly as the storm in the movie comes. The Vatican II Council wants the church to develop friendlier relationships people the ministry and congregation. Now, Sister Aloysius begins to suspect Father Flynn of improper relations with the school's first black student, Douglas Miller due to his seemingly over friendly behavior. As the conflict is never fully resolved and wind never ceases to blow, one is left wondering if there a truly trustworthy place still exists. The Christmas pageant scene is the most important scenes of the film. This scene gives excellent insight into the characters and plot. Sister Aloysius asks the priest into her office for the discussion of the Christmas pageant. Soon, it becomes clear Aloysius simply asked him into the office under false pretenses, yet accuses the priest of being the liar for denying having an inappropriate relationship with Douglas Miller. Aloysius takes the priests' preference for three scoops of sugar in his tea, desire for a secular song in a Christmas pageant, and friendly relationships with the people of the congregation as signs of overindulgence and inappropriate, Antichrist behavior. Meanwhile, Flynn sees Aloysius' strict rules and accusing remarks as the actions of a stiff, old world, pre-Vatican II dictator who thrives on putting fear in the hearts of children. Their argument escalates and the audience can sense there is much more behind this conflict than ""Frosty the Snowman.""Not only is there a difference between Aloysius and Flynn, there is also a contrast between how the nuns and priests interact with each other. In two separate dinner scenes, we see how the women behave with each other and how the men behave with each other. The nuns eat in a somber atmosphere, where discussion is one-sided and marked by the ringing of a bell. The priests laugh and joke. Yet, both scenes depict a sense of protection. Aloysius quietly moves an eating utensil so the sister who is going blind can find it. Seeing as a blind nun would be kicked out, this simple act shows the sisters are willing to protect each other's secrets. The men's behavior gives a fraternal relationship feel that makes one feel that they also would protect each other. These parallel scenes, which is an excellent narrative technique to highlight comparative groups, are artfully included to highlight these relationships.This film was expertly cast. Meryl Streep takes on the role of a nun whose absolute certainty of the priest's guilt with such conviction it is hard to remember she is just an actress. Philip Seymour Hoffman is to be commended for being able to act like a priest who is acting like he has nothing to hide. Amy Adams expertly acts as a innocent nun caught up in a messy situation and must make a decision between suspicious evidence and someone's sensible explanation. Even some of the smaller roles were cast well. Viola Davis, who plays Mrs. Miller, beautifully portrays a desperate mother who cares so much about her son's happiness, she is willing to overlook what happens between the priest and son.This movie leaves the audience uncertain. What are you supposed to do when you suspect someone of seducing a child? What are you supposed to do when enjoying a secular Christmas song, lending a helping hand and taking three scoops of sugar in your tea is the basis for a pedophile accusation? The answers are never easy in Doubt.",Doubt
347,ejrhoades,Manchester College Review,9,1 October 2012,"Doubt is an intense movie about the uncertainty of religion, the chain of religion, and the flaws within the Catholic Church in the 1960's (Abstract). The movie does not just question God, but the Catholic Church as a whole. The movie takes place in a Catholic private school in the late 1960's (Analysis). The nuns run the school while the pastor oversees them. The main characters are the two nuns. One is the teacher, Sister James, and the second one is the principle. Another meaningful object in the movie would be the Father stressing the importance of clean hands (Analysis). He told the boys that it didn't matter if their fingernails were long or short, but they needed to be clean. This was symbolic to religion. Everyone sins, but it is important to wash away your sins through communion or confession. Father would not confess his sins, but washed his own hands to rid himself of his sins. However, in the religion of Catholicism, God can only wash away your sins through confession. Meryl Streep plays nun who is the principle of the school. She played her character fantastically. Her character was not the typical nun. She lied and stepped outside the boundaries of a typical nun in order to figure out the truth. Her character was a very strong, independent woman who questioned her faith in the church. The specific scene that she played the best was when she was having her last conversation with the Father in her office when she made up the lie that she called a nun from his previous church. This was a very powerful and emotional scene where she threatened to leave the church in order to prove the Father was guilty. Maryl Streep couldn't have played the part any better (Evaluation). As for the movie as a whole, the writing was purely fantastic. There were many different forms of doubt taking place in the movie (Evaluation). Not only do we see a transformation happening with the nun's faith, but I noticed how I started doubting religion as a whole. How could someone such as the Father who has that much authority in the church take advantage of his power and do such horrible things? This makes me question the goodness of religion. The symbol of the wind plays such a huge symbolic role within the movie. There are many different times that Maryl Streep refers to the intensity of the wind. There are multiple times where a window has been left open and the wind is blowing rain into the rooms. There were times when characters commented on the wind and how it has gotten worse. At the end of the movie when the Father is gone, the wind is back in control. This seems to be a symbol of how the Father was stirring things up within the church (Grouping). There was a scene in the movie where the Father and Maryl Streep were arguing about where the direction of the church needed to go (Induction). At this time in history, the Catholic Church was dividing between a more contemporary style versus the traditionalists. Maryl Streep was very against the contemporary style church whereas the father was very open to new ideas. I noticed the tension between this throughout the whole entire movie. This was a great depiction of what was happening in the church at that time (Induction). All religions have some sort of doubt, in this movie doubt took on many different forms (Deduction). The nun's started to have doubt when they questioned the goodness of the Father. Sister James doubted the goodness of the religion and that's why she was having difficulty sleeping at night. At the very end scene when the two nuns are talking, we finally see Maryl Streep break down and say how much she questions and doubts the Catholic Church and the goodness of God. I learned a lot of different things from this movie. One of the major things I learned is the technique of symbolism (Synthesis). Doubt seemed to get most of the deeper messages within the movie through to the audience by using these symbols. If I pay more attention to symbols then it's easier to get the deeper meaning of the movie.",Doubt
348,Vidstar24,A mess of a film with so much potential.,3,13 April 2009,"What happened? 'Doubt' had so much potential to be a brilliant film - but instead it faltered with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching. The only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of Meryl Streep, who no DOUBT deserved the Oscar-nomination. Though it was not one of her best performances, she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which blossomed through the screen.However, not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill. From the boring start, which had no power or punch - to the less than convincing ending, the film was truly a disappointment - especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers. It was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film, which dragged on for too long, with too much talk and not enough action.Furthermore, the other Oscar-nominations were less than convincing. Though Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, it was by no means Oscar-worthy. (Especially since they completely left out performances such as Will Smith, in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve the nomination. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - as it was one sided and plain. It would have made more sense to nominate her for a Razzie, as I am sure she would have walked away victorious. Viola Davis gave a short but truthful performance, but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination.Overall, I consider Doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of 2008. It was a mess of a film with so much potential, and I do not recommend it. The only shining light in the film is Meryl Streep, who though gives a stunning, solid performance - doesn't even do enough to save this film. *** / 10.",Doubt

Compared to either of these the movie is almost unwatchable. I've been plodding through the DVD for the past two evenings and am still not finished. Way too much extraneous dialog, and waaay too many added scenes and people. Yes, the four major performances are quite good, esp. Ms. Streep's.

352,knopkalife,What do you do when you're unsure?,8,3 February 2018,"My film review I want to begin with such quotations: «Our doubts are traitors, and make us lose the good». And one more quotation is «Doubt is an illness that comes from knowledge and leads to madness». I think that these quotations fully express the meaning of this film.
I'm going to speak about the film that is called «Doubt». Doubt is an American drama film that was written and directed by John Patrick Shanley based on Doubt: A Parable. The film takes place in a St. Nicholas school led by Sister Aloysius. Sister James tells Aloysius that Father Flynn might have too much personal attention with the school's only black student Donald Miller, thus leading to Aloysius starting a crusade against Flynn. 
I can say that I like this film. I would put 8 score out of 10. Why not 10? I'm a thriller lover. I love films with unexpected plot ends and action, action, action. This film is absolutely opposite. However, it is still a beautifully made, balanced and mind-bending film in its own right.
The place and the season of the year (autumn) in which the film was made creates a certain atmosphere. The beginning made me listen for every little sound in the film: the rustle of leaves, wind noise, sounds of rain, all these small details create the mood and put me through that. Being an aesthete, I was really fascinated by the costumes. I really like this conservative and restrained; certainly more classic style and design.
What struck me most was the acting of the actors. I've watch a few films with Amy Adams and I couldn't «fall in love» with her or with her acting, it seemed like she didn't match to the roles or vice versa. But this film was a revelation for me. I opened this actress, I really believed her and couldn't take my eyes off. As for cast itself, I was very glad to see Maryl Streep and especially, Viola Devis. She doesn't play the main role here but after watching the serial «How to Get Away with Murder», she is one of the best actress of all time. Returning to the issue of the cast, I think they did a good job for sure! The acting was so fascinating and convincing, it's absolutely remarkable.
The best scenes in the film are the scenes of Father Flynn's sermons. They are so thought-provoking. It adds a lot to the film. To my mind, these episodes teach the viewers main film's ideas. What do you do when you're unsure? Is gossip a sin The main topic in the film that capture the essence.
Speaking about camera operations, everything was done well. It fully shows character's emotions, describe the settings and of course, creates the atmosphere. It use a lot of close-ups, every wrinkle, emotion can't be hidden from our eyes.
 I would have no hesitations in recommending this film.",Doubt
353,funnylala,Did not surpass my expectations.,4,4 February 2018,"First of all, I wasn't amazed by this film at all. This is because I don't like movies, where a church is taken as a main scene. But I don't blame anyone for it, I was just told to watch this film, so I did.
The story is set in the Catholic Church School in New York in 1964. I won't describe you the plot as it is given on this website. I've just mentioned the setting and the time as they give you the understanding of what the film is like. At least, this sentence made me understand I wouldn't like the film at all. Nevetheless I watched it and now let me give you the reasons it wasn't good.Firstly, the lenght of the film is unjustifiably big. The plot is not that twisted and complicated. Thus, the film could've been compressed to 1 hour lenght. Secondly, it is dull. There is only one setting, which is a catholic church school, there are no actions, and special effects, it is not dynamic - in other words, the movie isn't gripping at all. If you don't turn the film loud enough, you have a risk to fall asleep. You can object and say that this is because of the genre, which is drama, but I can respond that there are dramas, which are more exciting and worth watching.Thirdly, the plot of the film itself is odd. Briefly, an Afro-American student, Donald, is bullied in the class and his only friend is a priest, who is much older than this schoolboy. Being suspected in strange relationships with Donald, a strict principal fires a priest. At the end, the principal confesses that she didn't have any evidence of these suspicious relationships to dismiss him. 
So, what is the idea? My only suggestion is ""Never blame anything on anyone until you are 100% sure"". Though, I guess the film has more profound sense and I simply wasn't able to get it.
The reason I rated this movie 4/10, not 0/10 is that I really like the cast. Meryl Streep perfectly performes a role of Sister Aloysius Beauvier, an intimidating principal. Her eyes and gait are so heavy that I could feel it through the TV screen. Another main character is Father Brendan Flynn played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. He acts his part very well, no doubt. He makes me believe in his innocence (although it isn't proved he was guilty). One more actress in this film is Amy Adams, who plays Sister James. She is a nun at the parish school and a blameless young teacher, who is the first to notice strange relationships between Donald and Father Brendan Flynn and the first to tell this to Sister Aloysius Beauvier. She is also great at playing second fiddle to the principal though having her own point of view. 
To sum up, this film has quite a high rating and a lot of positive, highly-rated reviews. I'll probably be the first to rate it lower than 5/10, sorry. As my title says, the film didn't surpass my expectations.",Doubt
354,margaret-58981,Spoilers Are Impossible,8,5 February 2018,"What can one expect from the film with a title ""Doubt""? Mystery is a central plot mechanism. It paints a rather different picture. There are many possibilities of how the action may develop and the film provides evidence to support nearly every one of them. The picture is based on Pulitzer Prize-winning play and directed by John Patrick Shanley. The events take place at the Catholic school in the Bronx in 1964, a year after the assassination of President Kennedy. The progressive Father Flynn wants the school to catch the wind of change, which is much to the disproof of the school's principal Sister Aloysius. The children of the school are terrified of the harsh Sister, who hates ballpoint pens, prohibits sugar and finds a pagan symbolism in the Frosty the Snowman song. Father Flynn however has built a genuine relationship with his students, and has even taken young Donald Miller, the school's first black student, under his wing.The director does an admirable job in enhancing the scenes with suspense and provocation. Every single monologue and action is calculated to achieve the maximum effect. The mystery is added by symbolism of the wind, rain, thunder, a cat catching a mouse and a burning bulb. At the center of modest setting is a duet play of two outstanding actors Meryl Streep and Philip Hoffman. They are capable of creating persuasive characters with no make-up and unchanging clothes. The scenes between them are thrilling and catching from start to finish. It's mainly an emotional struggle of two atlantes. Their acting is shaded by a sweet and naive Sister James by Amy Adams. Like an audience she reflects our own misgivings and flounces from one strong figure to another. And Viola Davis as a mother of a trouble boy performs a powerful and painful monologue which sheds some light on the matter but still doesn't offer an easy solution. The term ""spoiler"" seems to be inappropriate for this film as the twist plot doesn't get a definite resolution. The moral decision is left to the audience as jury. As good oaky wine the film leaves a long aftertaste which draws our thoughts back to the film again and again and every time plunges deeper in doubt.",Doubt

It seems to her that Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) does not meet the moral and church statute at all. He quietly smokes, drinks wine in the evenings, loves the sweet. But most of all, sister Aloysius is worried about Flynn's excessive love for their new boy, the black boy Donald. The principle is filled with doubts: is it not hidden that sinful in such a care of the priest? And Sister Aloysius arranges a whole investigation to find out the true cause of Father Flynn's love for Donald. Will the woman develop her doubt, or confirm it? What will prevail - faith or justice?With great interest, I was watching the dramatic story created by the play of the same name.
It is filled with psychological problems, questions of faith and at the same time in this history there is always an actual vital moment - how easy it is to get rid of someone unwanted.
The action takes place approximately in 1964 in the United States, in a Catholic school for children.
Between the principal of the school, the abbess sister Aloysius Bovier and the priest-teacher Father Flynn a deep conflict is ripening.
She is a conservative and tough woman who does not accept anything new. He is a kind and cheerful person, striving to keep up with life, sincerely loving children.
Aloysius dreams of dismissing an unwanted priest, and soon there is supposedly a serious reason for this.
But is this really a truth what is accused of Father Flynn?
This is a film about the importance of doubt, the horror of slander and gossip, the dramatic fate of a number of characters, how difficult it is for those who do not fit into generally accepted norms.
And who knows where is the truth? Many people are very clever to wear masks, especially when your life is at stake.
This is what the viewer has to understand. For you to help, there is the brilliant game of all the actors, without exception; harsh, emotional dialogues; strong intriguing scenario.
The film is built on dialogues, dueling views and heartfelt emotions. Everyone has his own truth, and it is impossible to tear off the eyes from how heroes defend it.
The atmosphere of time is conveyed quite realistically, in all details, as well as the atmosphere in the church school.
Shooting is very qualitative; it creates a certain mood, conducive to reflection.
Musical accompaniment is beautiful, there are secular and spiritual melodies.
The actor's game is strong, especially Meryl Streep stands out, she created a complex and unobtrusive image, which is especially clear in the final scene.
Doubt is a very complex, difficult and rather uncomplicated feature film that leaves a lot of questions and doubts after viewing the picture. The film, in my opinion, deserves an excellent evaluation, I can recommend it for viewing.",Doubt
356,reebokpercent,Anyway the wind blows,9,11 February 2018,"'Doubt' is a gripping psychological drama with incomparable Meryl Streep and brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman in the leads. The film is directed by John Patrick Shanley and based on his own Pulitzer-Prize winning stage play of the same name. 
 Before watching the film you may be attracted by the film poster with a cross (a symbol of faith) and the word 'doubt' depicting on it, what immediately hooks you due to combining two mutually exclusive concepts. Actually the whole film is based on opposition and proves how controversial can be issues of Good and Evil looked at from different perspectives.
 It is natural for humans to doubt. It is a result of their capability of speculation and their innate desire to find the truth. However, there are cases when not everyone is ""allowed"" to doubt due to some personal moral convictions or some restrictions from outside. That's what happens to the main character of the picture, the head nun, Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep), who dares to call in question righteousness of the priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) suspecting him of sexual relationship with one of the students of the Catholic school. Her suspicion is neither confirmed for the lack of evidence, nor refuted, but the seed of doubt is already implanted in our minds as well as in the mind of a younger nun, Sister James, wonderfully portrayed by graceful Amy Adams. She observes this opposition between ""the prosecutor"" and ""the accused"" and with childish naivety tries to find absolute truth, which is non-existent in the context of the film.
Particular attention should be given to excellent acting of Meryl Streep, who perfectly suits the role of a self-possessed principal, running the school in an imperious and domineering manner. Her conservatism seems to be on the verge of absurdity, from prohibition on ballpoint pens and candies to total control of the students (episode with the portrait on the blackboard). So, in comparison with Father Flynn, whose appearance is as ""sweet"" as his tea and whose deeds and speech are always alarmingly good, Sister Aloysius looks like a true oppressor. However, such an image of her somehow fades as the film progressed. It is she who takes care of her whole nuns' community in the male-dominated environment. Those touchy moments, when she displays particular concern for the elderly Sister Veronica who is going blind, just testify that she is a perfect leader: tough but considerate. A true venerator of traditions Sister Aloysius has a genuine fear of changes, which are brought to Bronx Catholic School with the wind of 1964. Her remark about the weather 'the world is crashing' becomes pivotal for the whole film and even more crucial for herself. In attempts to stop liberalism that starts shifting firm conservative views, the head nun crosses swords with the priest, considering him a disseminator of destructive liberal views. But in the end, ironically, she finds herself doubting her own longstanding believes, realizing that values of the modern world are no longer the same, and that something, once used to be totally unacceptable, today is quite adequate.

Far, far away. To the England of, say, Ten Little Indians. Or to the train journey covered on Murder on the Orient Express. Or to any setting of any number of other brilliantly constructed mysteries that have successfully enabled a number of novelists to make a living. Agatha Christie and the rest shared an important talent with author of ""Doubt""--the ability to leave tiny clues on the trail pointing, inexorably and in aggregate, to a truth--a truth that we deny was there all along. Did he or didn't he? Let's face it--it's clear enough.Crumb 1: A hero worshiping 12 year old tells a priest that he wants to enter the profession. Offhandedly, and with surprising diffidence, the man of the cloth says ""you'll make a good one."" And instead of praising the career choice, the priest instead produces a toy--an exotic dancer that twists on a table--and encourages the boy to play with it. Crumb 2:""There are things I can't tell you,"" the rather dodgy priest says to his interlocutor in the most high stakes debate of the film. Yes, his protagonist, Sister Aloysius, is made as unsympathetic as possible (snickers at her declaration of Frosty the Snowman as a threat to faith filled the theatre I attended), but it is clear her case is never disproven.Crumb 3: I could go on. But herein lies the brilliance of the film: we are fascinated for virtually every moment of the 1 hour, 40 minute film--but it's not because we are trying to determine innocence versus guilt. We are driven to see if moral certainty--and the authority of experience--will carry the day in the end. We all have at least one thing that we believe in to the core of our being. Would we go to the mat for that belief, as Sister Aloysius does? Or would a doubt, large or small, be our highly defensible excuse for opting out? How much proof, in fact, is demanded if our entire life experience points to undeniable realities?These hard questions and more are tightly interwoven into this masterwork, brought fully to life by superb acting. Meryl Streep as school principal Sister Aloysius is able to compellingly show us several facets of what initially appears to be a one-dimensional, closed-off and cosseted character. Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the priest is highly likable, yet has his own veneer. The supporting actors are picture-perfect, although one can't help but wonder why there is no opportunity for the boy who is the epicenter of the storm--Donald--to report on what has or hasn't happened to him at the priest's hands, not by his mother, father, teacher, or religious leader.Although a few on this forum complain that the original play's material wasn't taken to another level by virtue of film, in this case the ""play's the thing."" We don't need a greater expanse of scenery or a cast of thousands.

Meryl Streep is one of my heroes she will always be be here something happened. Her performance is devoid of highs and/or lows. She goes through it in second gear. I had hoped for a performance of the Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratchet with a pleasant almost benign exterior but a monstrous center and Philip Seymour Hoffman, another great, doesn't project any kind of sexual vibe so the sexual allegations may work on a stage play but not on the screen. The part needed a John Garfield. On top of that, there is something missing on the structure of the story. We're taken through two acts but the third act is missing. I didn't believe in that ending it felt to come out of left field. So yes, I was entertained but dissatisfied.",Doubt
362,suzannerosbach,Best Film I've seen in years,10,28 December 2008,I rarely go to movies anymore because most movies made by the Hollywood machine are just plain junk & not worth my time & money. I do love the acting style of Phillip Seymore Hoffman though. Everything about him spells QUALITY ACTING. So this was top on my list to see. I was not disappointed. The acting all around was superior. The setting matched the general mood of the film. Even the ringing phone added tension. The director & script leaves the audience to their own conclusion as to what actually happened to the child by the priest. I did not feel manipulated by the presentation. This film was sublime to watch and near as perfect as I've ever seen.,Doubt
363,bishopt2,Try Being In That Position,10,3 January 2009,"I am a graduate of Marquette University Class of 1976 from the College of Journalism with a double major in investigative journalism and theology. I went on to become a vowed member of the Third Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel for 13 years in the inner city of Chicago, Illinois in the very neighborhood I grew up in as a teenager.During that time when I was a member of the Order and the Catholic Church, I was involved in going after five priests in four different parishes who were stealing, molesting kids and selling drugs. I became known as a ""church cleaner"" which got me in tons of trouble with the powers that be of the Roman Catholic Church. I found my journalism background stood me in very good stead as I had the tools and training to find the truth and try to catch some very bad guys indeed.Later on, when I left the Catholic Church and was eventually ordained a pastor in another denomination, I found out that such problems were not limited to the Roman Catholics. That was not a surprise to me as I was also called in to deal with the same problems in other denominations. So I left the Roman Catholic Church to become a pastor, not because of any sense of shock over the scandals I had found. Believe me, the Baptists and Pentecostals are just as messed up or worse.But seeing this movie reinforced the sense of contentment I have at not being a part of that Catholic system any more. If you have ever been in a parish where the priests are white and arrogant and engage in behaviors that are reprehensible, while the parishioners are black and poor, you will have NO problem understanding how hard it was to prove the guilt of the priest in this story. Neither will you struggle to understand the dynamics of the extreme gender bias and powerlessness you have as a female of color in a church dominated by males back then.Philip Hoffman managed to channel the exact persona of such a pedophile priest. Those flowers that he carries in his prayer book are the trophies of his conquests of other little boys. The undershirt, the smell of wine on the boy's breath, the confusion of the mother, the way the other boys behaved around the priest and the young Black boy and most of all, the way the priest reacted when Sister Aloysius said she had talked to another nun at his old parish tells me that this man was guilty as sin. I knew Black mothers who would allow their kids to be molested from some misguided notion that it was ""good for them"" and that there was ""nothing they could do about it anyway.""Having been in that position, I would have done the same thing as the Mother Superior, because I have been there. She's just lucky that she didn't end up being fired from her position. That's exactly what happened to me and all the nuns who stood with me on my first ""cleaning."" The priests went and so did we by order of the bishop. The convent was sold to a group of Black Muslims, thus depriving many aged sisters of their home. That was the revenge we had placed on us for catching our priests stealing over $65,000 and sleeping with the married parish secretary. The parish was due to be closed because of ""lack of funds."" We saved the parish and lost our jobs in the process.When this film comes out on video, I recommend that it be shown in every church around the country with a discussion guide. These issues of abuse of power, guilt mongering, pedophilia and other such problems needs to come out for everyone to see and understand. This well acted, thought out and very realistic film is an excellent vehicle for this purpose as well as being great entertainment.",Doubt

I'm not a Roman Catholic, so I don't have personal experience to color my opinions, but I'm appalled at sexual abuse by priests. I'm also appalled by nuns like Sister Aloyicious (sp?). She was ""smarmy."" I came away with the feeling that she was so obsessed with her suspicions of Father Flynn because she had her own ""problems,"" namely, in her feelings for the younger nun--that she was ""projecting,"" to use psychobabble. Why wasn't she harder on Sister James, who strenuously opposed her at least once in the film? My husband disagreed with me about the priest's guilt or innocence, until we talked about it. He came over to my side: that Father Flynn was innocent. At any rate, we agreed that the movie lived up to its name and that ""Doubt"" ruled the day.",Doubt

She treated the students terribly. She seemed to enjoy being top dog and running everyone ragged in fear of her. I think she had a sick need to be right at all costs. She conjured up the whole sexual abuse thing in her head because that for some reason is what she wanted to see. She added two and two and got six. I'd say she was one sick woman who lied, manipulated and broke her vows of compassion for her own evil thoughts. While excellent this movie was hard to watch. I don't believe Father Flynn seduced the boy but because this was 1964 and he wanted a more progressive education and took time to care about students he may have been accused of things previously. The other shame is that poor Donald Miller lost a friend in Fr. Flynn. Thank God I never ran into a nun like her.",Doubt

I was engrossed from the start and rather than fall asleep on my sofa as I thought I would, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.Although it starts quite slow, it does give the audience a good background as to what is going on in both the church and the school and introduces the priest and Streep extremely well. You find yourself hating Streep and liking the priest from the start. As the story develops you understand just how easy it is, with the right personality, to groom young children when you are in a position of power. Streep on the other hand, is not likable at all during the film.A definite recommendation!!",Doubt
367,GarySchouborg,Explores the dialectic between intimacy and personal boundaries.,9,25 January 2009,"Some reviewers have seen Doubt as a whodunit polemic against moral intolerance. Though that may be the creators' intent, the film itself is richer and subtler. It's a brilliant exploration of the role of doubt and conviction in the dialectic between intimacy and personal boundaries. If you haven't seen the movie and don't want to know about two major surprises in the plot, read no further. I can't make my point without revealing them. Father Flynn (FF, Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the progressive priest for whom kindness takes priority over belief and rules. Sister Aloysius (SA, Meryl Streep in a quirky tour de force) is the conservative nun for whom conviction and rules govern. Sister James (SJ, Amy Adams) is the innocent every-person who isn't sure which of the two to follow. Donald Miller (Joseph Foster) is the first and lone black student in a Catholic high school of Irish and Italian children. Donald's mother (Viola Davis in a stunningly artless performance) defends him against his father, who physically abuses him for being gay, the students, who could lash out against him at any moment, and SA, who would sacrifice him on the altar of her moral and prosecutorial convictions. FF's warm kindness and SA's cold intolerance are their most obvious traits. Yet there is also a troubling softness to FF, one that raises doubt whether he is wholly kind or also indulging a need for approval that blinds him to what is truly good for the youngsters in his care. In contrast, SA is truly kind to those whose need is obvious: the older, failing sisters in her community. She is also shrewd and practical, aware that the students' welfare often requires tough love, though she maniacally over-does the toughness. The interaction among these five personalities drives not only a compelling whodunit and polemic against intolerance, but at a deeper level, an interplay between intimacy and personal boundaries. Five scenes are particularly revealing. The first is SA's care to follow the rule that she and any priest not be in her office alone. The rule unnecessarily distances her from FF. But it also prevents unfounded suspicions. After all, had FF and Donald always had a witness to their meetings, there would be no suspicion, even from SA, that their encounters were sexual.The second scene is where SJ uncharacteristically asserts herself toward a student who disrespects her in class. A sensitive, timid, inexperienced, and unassertive young nun, she wins our approval in finally standing up for herself. Yet almost immediately, she apologizes to the student when she sees how mortified he is by her unexpected forcefulness. This is a highly ambiguous, subtle scene that can be read several ways. Those focusing on intolerance can see her as recognizing her error in judging the student to have done something wrong. Those focused on personal development can see her as rightly sticking up for herself but unable at this early stage to maintain her posture, quickly backing down lest she make anyone an enemy. But within the framework that I'm drawing here between personal boundaries and emotional intimacy, there is revealed the difficulty of asserting oneself while maintaining intimacy. New to the skill, SJ distances herself from the student while rightly insisting that she be respected. Recognizing the resulting rift between them and valuing intimacy more than anything else, she apologizes to the student in order to repair the breach. The film might have let us know that a more integrated Sister James could have asserted herself while maintaining intimacy. Whether deliberately or not, whether unfortunately or not, the film does not present us with that possibility. In the third scene, SA reveals to Donald's mother that she herself was married before becoming a nun. We are stunned to find this out. What are we to make of it? Was she happily married and embittered by losing her husband in the war? Or was she a frigid woman who was freed by her husband's death to become a nun free to follow her moral convictions and traditional preferences? Or what other clues to her character might this revelation give us? The fourth scene is the most morally sensitive one, where Donald's mother reveals to SA that her son is gay and being physically abused by his father for it. Rather than disgusted by the possibility that FF has seduced Donald, she is grateful for the priest's love for the boy in a world where the boy is loved by no one else. She therefore confronts SA, explaining how exposure of the alleged relationship between FF and Donald would only hurt the boy, and challenging SA whether she's on the boy's side or that of her heavy-handed moral understanding of love. In the final scene, SA confesses to SJ her own doubts. About what, she doesn't say. About FF? About her faith? About her many convictions of how life ought to be lived, including an almost moral fervor in her preference for fountain pens over ball-points? About how her grasping for conviction has robbed her of emotional intimacy with others? Characteristically, and with great integrity, the film does not say. In none of these scenes does the film indulge the audience with a clear answer. But the doubt in question is not primarily the immediately obvious one of whether FF really did seduce the boy. In all these scenes, we are left with conflict between behavior that distances us from others and behavior that draws us to emotional intimacy. Which does which under what conditions, we are left to ponder. The genius of the film is that it leaves us ultimately exposed to ourselves, challenged with our own inner discernment between practicality that is an emotional Pyrrhic victory and practicality that is constructive; and between intimacy that is merely feckless sentimentality and intimacy that is true communion between two flesh and blood mortals.",Doubt

369,morpheus1590,I think it's an analogy,10,17 April 2009,"I think that Doubt actually analogizes the differences between conservatives and liberals. Sister Aloysius, of course, represents conservatives. She is stuffy, scary, and clings to her beliefs with almost fanatical conviction. She's really dogmatic and a little obnoxious, but she's still somehow kinda lovable. A little like a cute, black bat. Meanwhile Father Flynn, representing liberals, seems really hip and cool, and is always trying to challenge established traditions and ideas. He's great because he lets you get away with all sorts of stuff. So you're an alter boy who likes to sneak a little wine now and then --who cares? Hey, if it feels good, do it. Still, he's somehow slightly creepy, and in your heart of hearts, you know he's molesting little boys on the side. In the long run, even though Sister Aloysius' holy crusade against Father Flynn doesn't earn her many friends, at the end of the day you're thankful she was around. She may be slightly out of her mind, but you know you're probably better off without that creepy priest hanging around.",Doubt
370,Floorer6,Faithful to director's intentions; well-acted by principals,7,14 May 2009,"Fist off, I'd like to address the frequent comments here praising the film for keeping the audience in the dark regarding the father's guilt or innocence. I'm puzzled. From the halfway point onward, the film actually makes the verdict quite clear, and the ending practically slam dunks it home (despite the attempt made immediately to back-pedal). I'm wondering if some of the viewers fell asleep early, or are referring to another film.Anyway, Hoffman and Streep are outstanding here (it's a relief to see Streep working for her check again, quite frankly - she could coast on her laurels like DeNiro), although I can't say the same for some of the others, especially Amy Adams. She wasn't wrong for the part, but piling on even more innocence and weakness than she already possesses made her character cartoonishly unbelievable. Any nun/teacher I had was at least a little authoritarian; enough to control a classroom. This is one of several examples where the film doesn't trust us to understand the primary character traits regarding how dominant and submissive the characters are. Even Streep's portrayal herself seems a little over the top - but I understand the film needed to get us on the priest's side early on, rather than her's. In that sense, the writer/director did the right thing, although it still comes across as excessive manipulation. There was still room for much more subtlety in the film. Either way, the confrontation between the priest and the principal would have occurred. And the revelation that she once had a life outside of the Church seemed distracting - surely her general prudish demeanor would make more sense if she had always lived as a nun.The only other flaw that bothered me a little bit was the unrelenting claustrophobia throughout. Again, we do get the oppressive atmosphere, but a more colorful, broader depiction might have given Hoffman's character even more room to exercise denial. He and the other men in power were portrayed as overly weak and passive-aggressive (such as in his sermons, which were swipes at her). It might have been better if the very real oppression of that time and place were revealed more in terms of how awesomely vast the advantage was for the men in charge. The film itself hinted at the growing network of higher ranking Church officials who might have/may yet come to his aid. He really could have destroyed her.In defense of the film (and all films, really), I've learned to forgive a film for being historically inaccurate to some degree. A filmmaker's job/intention is to make points or ask questions, and bring a script to life in a manner that is adequate for a 2 hour event. In that sense, Doubt succeeds pretty much perfectly. Pacing and dialog were consistent and efficient. Oh, and about Donald himself (the black youth who is suspected of being on the receiving end of improprieties) - he hardly gets a voice at all. At first I wondered if that was fair. But guess what - it was (if harsh). That's the point. He had no say. I wasn't molested in Catholic school, but I did experience something odd and unjust enough at the hands of the harsh female principal when I was 6 to make most adults and parents uncomfortable - and therefore doubtful. I even got punished for revealing what happened. No dice. At least Donald had an adult advocate (assuming he needed one - heh, note my lame attempt to keep the lid on the spoilers long after that barn door has been ripped from its hinges), even though the odds were against his advocate; far more than the film would have us believe.In summary, it's an intelligent film, when it's not engaging in too much caricaturing, and certainly as thought-provoking as the original playwright intended. Oh, and there's one scene where the principal meets Donald's mother, and is startled and appalled by her take on what might be happening to her son. This scene helps broaden the film's scope, and partially rescues it from the badly-damaged sense of balance it tries to draw us in with.",Doubt

Meryl Streep (one of my all time favorite actresses) proved her incredible worth once again with a stunning performance that could not have been done better. Amy Adams, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses, is a true joy to watch and does an incredible job.

Father Flynn's kindly nature is a stark contrast to Sister Aloysius' tyrranical disposition.Amy Adams plays Sister James, a fresh faced, innocent, young woman who loves and cares about her students. She is deeply concerned when she suspects Father Flynn of having an improper relationship with Donald Miller. Unconvinced, Sister James does bring the matter to the attention of Sister Aloysius, who pursues it most vehemently.All three actors did an amazing job in the movie.

Both lead actors, Streep and Hoffman deliver powerful, strong performances and make believable characters that go perfectly with Amy Adams's character.

375,heesunmin,Review for World Religions Class,7,28 May 2012,"The movie was based on a play by John Patrick Shanley which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, and is well-known for its controversial theme of pedophilia within the ranks of the Catholic Church. The film portrays developing tensions between Sister Aloysius, a strict principal of a Catholic school, and Father Flynn, the widely loved local priest. Throughout the story, the paranoid development centers around Sister Aloysius' suspicions that Father Flynn is involved in improper relations with a young African American student and the confrontations that are incited because of this.Regarding the content, I feel that the film's strength comes from the sense of unresolved mystery. We never really uncover the true motives of Father Flynn and this fact itself allows the story to have a more stirring impact on the audience. This is because people indeed cannot know everything that is going on within the ranks of the Catholic Church which is frightening especially in light of recent scandals related to pedophilia. The plot itself wasn't very intricate, and this could be considered a fault in the film, but actually, I felt that the simple setting and almost mundane turn of events speaks closely to the reality that unspeakable misconduct could be occurring right next door, hidden in a cloak of familiarity.The religious tradition in the film is the Catholic Church, and through the development of the story, I learned much more about the hierarchical nature of the institution, as well as the stereotypes often associated with Catholic schooling. It surprised me how much propriety was valued especially in the interactions between the Sisters and the Father, even to the extent that Sister Aloysius felt uncomfortable speaking with Father Flynn one-on-one. Additionally, when Father Flynn became angry about Sister Aloysius contacting a Sister from his previous parish instead of the Father there, I learned that there are quite a number of socially acceptable rules within the Catholic hierarchy. Secondly, the stringent school system instituted by Sister Aloysius was interesting because I had actually attended a Catholic School in New Jersey when I was in First and Second Grade (Though I was Protestant). Comparing my experience to the one in the 60s, I realized how much more progressive Catholic schooling became, though it is probably unfair to make such a judgment from only two Catholic schools. Overall, however, the movie did open up the Catholic tradition to me and gave me insight into a religion I didn't have a deep understanding of.",Doubt
376,GrafZeppelin127,Spectacular ambiguity.,8,9 August 2020,"Watch this movie once, with the idea that Fr. Flynn is guilty. Then watch it again, with the idea that he is innocent. Or do it the other way around. Shanley's dialogue is so perfectly, brilliantly ambiguous that this is really two movies in one. Both are powerful, and both possibilities are horrible to contemplate, for very different reasons.Having seen both the play (during its original run with Cherry Jones and Brian F. O'Byrne) and the film, the play obviously has the edge because it's more intimate, consisting only of four characters. The film expands its milieu (as film versions of plays typically do) but I think having the schoolchildren, other nuns, and school staff present in the film diminishes it just a bit. The play, of course, is about ""knowing"" things that we don't actually know, and the movie shows us some of what the play leaves to the imagination. Although the ultimate question remains ambiguous, the viewer may be distracted by looking for clues in the other characters, especially the kids.What gives this piece its power, though, on both stage and screen, is its stubborn refusal to answer that ultimate question, or to provide any solid evidence of either conclusion, leaving it entirely up to the viewer to judge these characters.",Doubt
377,jshore-3,A great adaptation of a very good play,9,25 December 2008,"*** This comment may contain spoilers *** I saw the play ""Doubt"" last year and liked it very much. Although the movie previews made me cautiously optimistic, I was still was doubtful (pun sort of intended) that such a thoughtful and intellectual play could be translated well onto the big screen. In particular, the ending of the play (which I really liked) was the kind of dramatic ending that works great on the stage of a playhouse but I just couldn't even imagine it being pulled off in a movie.Well, the good news is that the movie is even better than the play, helped along by tremendous performances by the lead actors. Furthermore, the ending from the play was basically preserved...and they made it work on the big screen! I have to admit that I was a bit surprised by a few of the negative comments that I saw here. I strongly disagree that the guilt or innocence of Father Flynn is made obvious in either the movie or the play. I think those who believe that may themselves by looking for easy answers, which is exactly what the play is teaching us we should avoid! I don't for the life of me know whether to believe that he is really guilty or not.Also, I cannot agree that the movie is anti-Catholic. In fact, I tend to see the whole story, while certainly using the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church as the subject of the plot, as really about much bigger themes. It is a fact that the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church is a big enough story that movies will be made that deal with it and if you don't like how this movie treats it, I can't see how you would like any possible treatment of it. I.e., I can't imagine how the people who complain could ever be satisfied unless the subject were not dealt with in the movies at all!",Doubt
378,earthling42,What do you do when you're not sure?,9,7 March 2018,"The performances of the cast in this film adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play make you doubt a lot of things, except their brilliance.
 
With this year's somewhat disappointing Oscars this 2008 film was like a breath of fresh air. The film explores a really relevant issue of the Catholic Church and pedophilia. The story takes plays in the 60's American Catholic School where a priest is accused by a school principal of corrupting an African-American altar boy. 
 
Unfortunately, ""Doubt"" didn't get as much attention as more recent ""Spotlight"" (no pun intended) and stayed underappreciated to some extent. I guess one of the reasons is ""Doubt"" not being as shocking and revealing as ""Spotlight"". 
 
However, this film grabs your attention right from the first speech by Philip Seymour Hoffman (Father Brendan Flynn) to the last words of Meryl Streep's character (Sister Aloysius Beauvier) and keeps you thinking and doubting. Father Flynn's thought-provoking metaphorical speeches play a big part in the film and show his perspective on things. Actually, there is quite a lot of metaphors in this movie: a cat catching a mouse (Flynn and Beauvier) and weather slowly changing from quite calm to a raging storm are some of the attention-worthy. 
 
Regarding cinematography they've made a safe choice by mostly using a very popular nowadays teal and orange color grading. Though using of diagonal shots to emphasize some of the highly emotional moments was an interesting creative decision. 
 
But the strongest part of the film is its actors: Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and incredible Viola Davis. They were outstanding and mesmerising in their roles. It was a pleasure to watch them not perform, but actually live on screen. It's a pity that none of them got an Oscar. Especially Viola Davis for her short, yet powerful performance.
 
To sum it up, ""Doubt"" is a remarkable film with interesting and diverse characters played by talented actors, which would make you question your own decisions and think about its consequences. I can guarantee that you won't regret watching this film.",Doubt
379,pacificsmn,Save your $10,4,23 December 2008,"The film is fixed with a delicious title. Doubt. The word floods the potential viewer's mind with questions. The desire to know the uncertainty the title promises draws you in. That and the star studded cast of accomplished actors. However, Doubt leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind as to the guilt of Father Flynn. Within three minutes his culpability is clear. With Donald's first line (the first words of a major character), it is obvious that he had inappropriate relations which lead to a discomfort with his body. Why else would a twelve year old boy ask if he looked fat-- especially in a movie we know will be pondering pedophilia. Next came the sermon shot. ""We're all hiding things"": pan to lady hiding illness, then man who's lost his friends, then to Hoffman as he talks of those who have done something sinful. Then comes the shot of Donald looking up to the light, to purity, but it's tainted by the presence of a pigeon, the filthiest bird of all. Already knowing the ending, I could have left before running out of popcorn.Shanley puts no trust in his audience, leaving no nuances to be discovered. Every idea is conspicuous and symbols appear to be thrown in for the sake of creating something ""deeper."" Flynn's destructive winds of change that hurt the old fashioned ways Sister Aloysius' loves (ie Sister Veronica's fall due to the wind) are somewhat cliché along with the literal storm that accompanies the ideological storm the conflict unleashes. The high point came later in Flynn's conversation with Sister James when he said Siser Aloysius was trying to bring them back to the ""dark"" ages and away from the ""light."" This more subtle hint (Thank You!) which clearly contradicted Streep's actions in the previous scene further proved Flynn's place as a liar. The only other appreciable part was how Shanley humanized Sister Aloysius. The scene where she scoots Sister Veronica's fork to her is a first glimpse of warmth. The anecdote about her listening to the transistor radio for news about her husband during WWII and her newfound love for it proves that she has a capacity for love she's saved but kept hidden since her husband's death. Streep does this without forgetting the strict front her character lives with. But the viewer only sees her ability to love and her rigidness. Sister Aloysius only has two shades. Even worse, the other characters only have one! There is no true depth to any of these characters, especially Amy Adams. Though she's meant to exemplify innocence, that doesn't have to imply stupidity. All I see is butterflies floating inside an empty head. Sister James gets tugged back and forth like a rag doll to a point where the viewer tires of it. As far as acting goes, there were no mind-blowing performances. Viola Davis outshined her more famous castmates. Hoffman seemed out of touch with the time period and his character, Adams was so-so (overly emotive at times), Streep was good, but faded in and out of her accent. No Oscar nods to be deserved here (perhaps with the exception of Davis).In conclusion, this whole movie could have been ten minutes without losing anything. The plot was nonexistent, causing the movie to drag on. For the first time since I saw Wickerman I wanted to walk out of the theater. I love Streep more than anyone I know, but even I can't throw my support behind her on this one. What I expected to be my favorite film of the year has turned out to be my least.",Doubt
380,evtushenko-94405,So boring,2,4 February 2018,"Despite of the acting of inimitable Meryl Streep this film was destined to drown in boredom.
The gloomy tone of the picture itself, boring and unconvincing dialogues finally disappointed. The feminine fantasy surpassed all expectations. Accusations without evidence, doubts and a huge number of subterfuges. What really pleased, so this comparison of male and female sex during lunch. It immediately becomes clear who the evil is.
Therefore, 20 out of 100, for the idea mostly.
Doubts sometimes ruin lives. The ambiguity of the choice is not always obvious. So it is here. It is not known whether there was any fault (for me, so it's not), but the choice is made. Alas!
In general, of course the whole thing is in the tastes, but the movie definitely does not meet the expectations from the deep and high morale of the film.",Doubt
381,doricheva,Too many questions,4,4 February 2018,"The actors in the movie did a good job, but I didn't get any idea of it. The story is full of obscurities, understatements, and blind sports. Thanks to Meryl Streep's acting that it gave me an opportunity to turn a blind eye to the story line of ""Doubt"". After watching it I still have a lot of open-ended questions, though I was watching the movie with all my attention. Why did Father Brendan start to be Donald's patron? Why didn't Mrs. Miller nip their relationship in the bloom? Why didn't Sister Aloysius turn to senior priests for help? of course, one may say the movie just gives us the ground for meditation, but there is no end of it. 
So, it was much more interesting for me to follow the developing of the underparts' stories. Such as London's, Sister James' and poor Sister Veronica's.",Doubt
382,partofme-02135,Doubt,7,4 February 2018,"""Doubt"" is a drama with an element of a detective movie, in which the action takes place at one of catholic schools. Two nuns - a young and not much experienced teacher Sister James and a strict and convinced Sister Aloysius - suspect a priest of getting into a close relationship with one of the fellow students and try to figure out if it's true. The plot concerns some very important themes like religion and the way people approve of their actions by it, intolerance, the theme of prejudice and doubt, of course. 
I can't say that I loved the movie really much, but there are some points that make the film worth watching:
1. Actors. I can't help but admiring how different Meryl Streep in every particular film is and how perfectly she can fit into a character she plays. In this movie she appears a rigorous headmistress of a catholic school who definitely calls contradictory feelings. I think she has greatly performed her character. Amy Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffman have also done their best.
2. The atmosphere of the film. The action takes place in the sixties which adds to some charm of that time. The bleak colours used in the film and the weather conditions like rain and snow create a certain feeling which one might compare with the feeling of doubt. You can't say for sure if the suspicion of the nuns is true. 
3. The dialogues. They are really long and concern different topics but they let you think and make your own conclusions and suppositions. It's great because you don't just watch the film as an entertainment but also think. 
In general, the film is worth watching, but if you're not fond of long dialogues and not very dynamic plots, you probably won't like it. The actors are great, the atmosphere certainly attracts and the film has a thought-provoking element. I would rate this film 7 out of 10.",Doubt
383,yana-07131,A good drama movie,7,11 February 2018,"I'm not a drama-lover, hardly any drama movie I managed to watch more that 20 minutes without falling asleep. This movie definitely won't let you take your eyes off the screen. The tension that's created by uncertainty and ambiguity of events holds your attention during the entire movie. The cast is absolutely well chosen, including one of the best actresses of all times Meryl Streep. It's exciting the way your opinion changes like a roller-coaster every time new facts of the story are revealed. The movie leaves you with a heavy heart after it's over and makes you reconsider many issues. If you doubt whether it's worth watching, at least this is a good reason to make a choice in favour of a thought-provoking-movie that's gonna probably change your whole perception of justice and guilt.
I would insist that this movie must be watched by people responsible for making decisions relating to other people. Accusation must have a valuable, facts-supported basis, but sometimes your intuition and inner belief overpowers. What would you stick to?",Doubt
384,alyssaoconnell,a must-watch,9,5 March 2018,"Sometimes I have a feeling I want to watch something deep and full of emotion, something that would give me to a bit of philosophical thinking. If you're craving to watch something to feel the same, 'Doubt' is definitely on the list! Moreover, that is a drama guys would enjoy watching too. It's not anything sweet or full of moments where you want to burst into tears. It is rather the one that would make you look inside yourself and ask, what do you do when you have doubt? and when you are FULL of doubt? what makes you feel doubt and why?Perhaps, part of the success is not just the feelings that you come across with while watching, but the cause of them (and this is not just all about the plot, its ideas and moral values). Part of the success is influenced but HOW the ideas are SHOWN. And there comes the time to praise Meryl Streep, Amy Adams, and Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting. I could not have imagined better actors for each of the 3 characters than these guys. No wonder the movie got so many awards. Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, by an Actress in a Supporting Role, by an Actor in a Leading role, also Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, wow! That is a must-watch one!",Doubt
