0,Leofwine_draca,Quite the bore,3,30 July 2021,"Here's another one I've previously heard a lot of good things about: SAINT MAUD (2019), a slow-burning slice of British horror about a young nurse whose latest role is as a caregiver to a terminally ill former dancer. As the plot slowly unfolds, it turns out the nurse is a committed Christian who believes her client's soul is in danger and who'll subsequently do anything to save her. Not a bad set-up there, but as it turns out this is a horror film for people who don't really like horror; in other words, there's not really much of it around.I spent the whole of the running time awaiting the inevitable plot twist, which was saved for the last five minutes, and it all felt fairly obvious and ordinary in its execution. It's one of those modern films that's constantly dark and dreary, shot in rainy Scarborough with a depressing look and feel to it. The actors aren't bad, particularly Jennifer Ehle who I've always liked since seeing her in THE CAMOMILE LAWN a few decades ago, but the script is dire and the religious stuff quite turgid and dull. Like THE BABADOOK I saw this over-advertised as the ""scariest movie ever"" and like that one I fail to see the fuss. I'm afraid that as a character study I found this quite the bore.",Saint Maud
1,kosmasp,Penetrating religion,8,15 July 2021,"This is not Boondock Saints - not a the horror version of it that is. Also some might even feel that this isn't the type of horror they expect. This is a more sublime and subtle horror, that really creeps up on you. A movie about an individual that has issues ... a lot of issues, that she thinks are resolved or at least will not surface, because of her love to God and His acceptance of her (she hears and feels him).Having said all that, the (alleged?) Saint in question is played so convincingly, so powerful, that the movie reaches a new height and level of obsession. And while as I said it is a slow paced movie, it still has quite the scares thrown in for good measure. Not just the final moment, that might really creep you out and give you quite the shock moment, that is able to stick with you.I personally like horror movies like this. You have to think about it, the filmmaker is challenging you to have your own experience and own thoughts of what you see and what it means ... very well made and while you may disagree with descriptions like ""masterpiece"", remember that it isn't the filmmaker who said it - it is the critics. You can have a different opinion on that and still really like the movie.",Saint Maud
2,jboothmillard,Saint Maud,6,12 October 2020,"I knew almost nothing about this presumably independent film, apart from reading and seeing posters containing positive reviews from critics, it was these alone that convinced me to go the cinema, while I could, during the COVID-19 pandemic was happening. Basically, following an obscure traumatic experience, Maud (The Personal History of David Copperfield's Morfydd Clark), a reclusive young nurse with an impressionable demeanour, pursues a pious path of Christian devotion. She is charged with the hospice care of Amanda (Pride and Prejudice's Jennifer Ehle), a retired professional dancer ravaged by cancer. Initially, Amanda admires Maud's good intentions, seeing to her every need, bathing, dressing, and feeding her. Maud's intense belief of her faith quickly inspires an obsessive conviction that she must save her patient's soul from eternal damnation, believing she has been appointed to do so by God. Slowly, Maud's behaviour becomes stranger, as she vies for Amanda's absolution and solidarity. The tense atmosphere only increases by the constant visits from Amanda's friend, perhaps lover, Carol (Lily Frazer), who Maud tries to keep away. Meanwhile, Maud bumps into an old friend, Joy (Lily Knight), they have a small conversation, exchange numbers, and go their separate ways. One night, Amanda throws a party at the house for many of her friends and colleagues. Maud is there helping with food and is jealous watching Carol get to close and kissing Amanda. The atmosphere turns sour when Amanda makes a small but seemingly snide comment, and Maud slaps Amanda in the face. Angered, Amanda tells her to leave and orders her superior to send a replacement nurse. Maud is devastated and shuts herself away for some time in her small flat. She tries going out and attempting to socialise with strangers, but only shuns them away. She also tries calling Joy hoping to spend some time together. During her seclusion, she talks to an unseen demonic voice speaking a foreign language (possibly the Devil), who gives her assurance. One day, Maud insanely sticks small nails into the soles of her shoes and goes out for a walk whilst her feet are in pain. She stops to rest on a bench and starts a conversation with a woman, who introduces herself as Ester (Rosie Sansom), until she abruptly walks away. Joy does eventually show up at Maud's flat and makes an effort to communicate with her, but Maud stays silent and faces away from her as she talks. Eventually, Maud lies and assures Joy that she is fine and makes an excuse to send her away. Maud then dresses herself in long white robes, like a misguided martyr, and walks to Amanda's care home, intending to kill her, some kind of ""absolution"". After killing Amanda, Maud walks onto the nearby beach, carrying a large container of flammable liquid. Beachgoers look on in horror as she pours the liquid all over herself and ignites a firelighter, causing her to go up in flames and burn to death. Also starring Turlough Convery as Christian, Marcus Hutton as Richard, Carl Prekopp as Homeless Pat, and Noa Bodner as Hilary. Clark is splendid as the tortured, devoutly Christian and mentally unstable loner, and Ehle is equally good as the innocent but bitter and stubborn dying woman intensely alienating her carer. It is a simple concept, a religious young woman who becomes dangerously obsessive and goes mad to the point of self-destruction, expect knowing nods to The Exorcist and Carrie, it has one or two jumps, but is mostly eerie and builds up to the shocking conclusion, an interesting psychological horror. Good!",Saint Maud

4,CinemaSerf,Saint Fraud if you are looking for a horror film....,6,19 October 2020,"Grumpy old Jennifer Ehle (""Amanda"") is a former dancer/choreographer suffering from a terminal, mobility impairing, illness and so requires round-the-clock care. Enter ""Maud"" (Morfydd Clark) as a heaven sent nurse to see to her body and her soul. Initially they bond OK, but soon it appears that the piety of the carer and her employer's rather liberated lifestyle are going to clash and that they do! There can be no doubting that Clark's performance is gripping, she really does emanate some of the senses of confusion felt by her character but this certainly isn't an horror film - more an inquest into personal religiosity. We are unsure as to whether ""Maud"" is just zealous beyond measure or whether (or not) God is in direct communication and that clearly leads her to some considerable personality issues - which though conveyed effectively by auteur Rose Glass, left me feeling that something was just a bit lacking - perhaps we needed a little longer on the screen; more at the start to get a better grip on just who and maybe what ""Maud"" was? Without it - well it didn't quite work for me. Probably doesn't need a big screen either.",Saint Maud

As Maud struggles to maintain her faith, devotion as a caregiver and facing a moment of clarity of divine purpose, Clark echoes Sissy Spacek's mousy demeanor of CARRIE, Mia Farrow's haunted mother-to-be in ROSEMARY's BABY and Angela Bettis' outsider-looking-in misfit MAY yet also elevates the maddening slow burn of the film's plot and themes with a unique balance.",Saint Maud
6,ferguson-6,her faith is questioned,7,24 May 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. This feature film debut from writer-director Rose Glass made the festival rounds beginning in 2019 and, like so many films, had it's opening delayed due to COVID. So even though it officially opened in February, I'm just now getting around to seeing it.Morfydd Clark (THE PERSONAL HISTORY OF DAVID COPPERFIELD, 2019, and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES, 2016) stars as Maud, a nurse relieved of her duties at a hospital after a tragedy. She's a recent convert to Roman Catholicism from a more free-spirited lifestyle, and is now convinced God not only speaks to her, but also periodically enters her body. Maud takes a new job as an in-home palliative care nurse for Amanda (Jennifer Ehle, ZERO DARK THIRTY, 2012), a former popular dancer/choreographer who resides in a large British seaside home as she waits for the terminal cancer to do what it does.As Amanda chain smokes, guzzles booze, and entertains guests (both intimately and socially), Maud becomes more committed to saving Amanda from herself so that she might have everlasting peace in her soon-to-come death. Though initially enchanted by Maud's pious dedication, Amanda ultimately rejects Maud's role as savior in a most public and humiliating manner. This not only costs Maud her job, but kicks her into a faith-questioning, pain/penance/sacrifice mode that is painful to watch. We've witnessed her in a near-orgasmic state as God takes over, and now we see the solitude and extreme loneliness of a lost soul seeking direction. Is she possessed? If so, by which ""side""? If not, is she a religious zealot or is she mentally ill ... is there even a distinction between the two? Maud's two different eye colors lend credence to two sides battling for control.In addition to Ms. Glass' screenplay and direction, cinematographer Ben Fordesman contributes strong work with extreme close-ups of Ms. Clark and creative shots of Amanda's house that turn it into a character - a house on the hill that's not the haunted one. The score from Adam Janota Bzowski adds just the right atmosphere to the uneasy feeling we have around Maud. The supporting cast includes Lily Frazier as Carol, Amanda's online hook-up, and Lily Knight as Joy, Maud's friend and former co-worker.We are initially led to believe this is a story about the unlikely connection between Maud and Amanda, but in fact, this is Maud's story and no one else's. Has she been chosen as God's disciple, or is she losing her mind? Is there even a discernable difference between the two? Filmmaker Rose, whether intentionally or not, seems to influenced by some fine films, including: William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST (1973), Scott Derrickson's THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE (2005), and two projects from Paul Schrader - TAXI DRIVER (1976) and FIRST REFORMED (2017). The inclusions of William Blake's religious paintings contribute to this as an example of the feelings non-believers have towards the pious and their often accompanying hypocrisy. Morfydd Clark's performance is top notch, and this is arthouse spiritual horror at its finest ... certainly not for the masses, but sure to tickle the fancy of a few.Currently streaming on Amazon Prime.",Saint Maud
7,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Dying can be so dull.""",3,9 October 2020,"Learning that in the coming days my local Odeon was going to close,I looked at the listings for what movie I would watch on the final opening day. Spotting one screening of a new Horror,I got set for a saintly final viewing.View on the film:Spending the majority of the film nursing the saving of a soul on her own, Morfydd Clark gives a very good performance as Maud, whose saintly innocent thin smile Clark has become increasingly brittle to all those who try to get near Amanda,and a slide into obsession over a holy faith in gaining her wings.Gazing over in wide-shots the brooding Scarborough skyline, writer/director Rose Glass attempts in her feature film debut to cross a slow-burn sinking Horror atmosphere uncoiled in long panning panning shots pulling at Glass & cinematographer Ben Fordesman plucking at Maud's sanity.Attempting to nail a eerie appearance via covering Amanda's house with dour colours, Glass undermines each chance for a chill to begin,by slapping on Adam Janota Bzowski's terrible,ill-judged Industrial grind,which rumbles on until the eyeball-rolling worthy angelic wings final being a extremely grating, on the nose ending.Burning the candle at religious and psychological Horror, the screenplay by Glass fails to nail either,due to the permanent distance Maud is kept at ruining any chance for psychological depth to be weaved into the Horror from Maud's relationship with Amanda, whilst the attempt at altering religious images into stark symbolism lands with a thud as Glass goes for a sledgehammer level of subtle for Maud's pray.",Saint Maud

9,MOscarbradley,Probably the most disturbing film you will see all year.,9,19 May 2021,"Horror movies come in all sorts of disguises that not everyone can recognise but then we all have our own horrors and our own definition of horror. Who can deny the horror of a lynching or being in a high-rise apartment as bombs fall on it from the sky but are movies about such things ever really thought of as 'horror' films. ""Saint Maud"" is a genuine horror movie and it's about the horror of not belonging, the horror of being so self-aware you actually go mad or insane and the horror of pain, both self-inflicted and inflicted on others; yes, there is a lot of horror in ""Saint Maud"".Of course, there's a clue in the title; it's also about the horror of religion. 'Maud', (a truly terrific Morfydd Clark), is a young nurse and carer whose latest assignment is looking after Amanda, (an equally terrific Jennifer Ehle), a former dancer now confined to a wheelchair and close to death. Described early on in the film as being something of a Norma Desmond, Amanda is also something of a bitch who nevertheless finds herself somewhat sympathetically attracted to the waif-like Maud who is convinced God has put her on earth for a purpose and that purpose is to 'save' Amanda.The opening shot is also something of a dead giveaway. You know from the moment you see her that Maud is no Saint Bernadette. She believes that to follow Christ you have to go the way of the cross; in other words you must take on board Christ's sufferings on earth and all the horrors they entailed, physically, if not quite in Maud's case at least, spiritually.This extraordinary film is brilliantly written and directed by Rose Glass and superbly shot by Ben Fordesman and unnervingly well scored by Adam Janota Bzowski and its horrors work because they are fundamentally real, (the more fantastical moments are clearly figments of Maud's warped imagination). Maud sees the visitors to Amanda's sprawl of house on its hill as spawns of the devil that she must battle by whatever means she sees fit but unlike other 'possession' films this is totally grounded in a horrible reality; the house and its location, (the seaside resort of Scarborough in the North East of England), feel just like the kind of places where Maud's obsessiveness could fester and Maud herself is like an open wound. An astonishing debut for Glass and I can't wait to see what she does next.",Saint Maud
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Her little saviour.,8,3 July 2021,"There are essentially two ways to read 'Saint Maud (2019)', though its final half-second pretty much tells you exactly which reading is preferred - intended, even - by its writer/director, and it constantly keeps you flittering back and forth between these readings until its final few frames (literally). A film focusing on a deeply religious character is always going to be controversial, even if it doesn't depict her doing fanatical and dangerous things, but I don't think that the picture is condemning religion itself. In fact, I don't think it's 'about' religion at all. Instead, it's about loneliness. Maud is a deeply flawed protagonist, spiralling further and further into her own personal delusions as she exhibits increasingly harmful behaviour. However, it's typically easy to empathise with her, without condoning her actions. The movie starts off more or less as a straight drama, seeing our lead take on a new position as an at-home nurse for an ex-dancer with late-stage leukaemia. There are levels of enigmatic dread running through this segment of the film, mainly thanks to the director's willingness to slow things down and gnaw away at the audience, but things don't really slip into proper horror territory until around halfway through. Even then, the horror is mostly subtle. There are some elements of wince-inducing body-horror but most of the scary stuff is psychological. It becomes increasingly clear just how entrenched we are within Maud's perspective, as we begin to get glimpses of the way she sees the world, and it's never clear what's actually 'real'. This keeps you on your toes until the thing reaches its somewhat surprising yet simultaneously inevitable conclusion. For the most part, the affair walks the line between supernatural and psychological with poise. There are only a couple of moments in which it wobbles, with one sequence in particular feeling as though it crosses that line a little, but they aren't all that bothersome once you've cemented your final reading of the narrative (which, again, will either be confirmed or entirely upended by the last half-second). It's a really interesting, engaging and effective experience overall. It's also achingly well-made, with some phenomenal cinematography and brilliantly low-key performances. It's distinct, it's disturbing and it sticks with you. 8/10.",Saint Maud
11,cruise01,"Unsettling, disturbing tone, and decent thriller.",7,21 February 2021,"3.5 out of 5 stars.Saint Maud is a pretty fair psychological horror film about a in home nurse Maud (Morfydd Clark) who is practicing catholicism and believes god is testing her. She visits her new patient Amanda (Jennifer Ehle) which is very ill. Spends her remaining time, trying to get by and having her hook ups. Maud tries to test her own boundaries trying to find her purpose which she is fearing that god has left her all alone.The plot is pretty decent. About Maud having a psychological breakdown. Believing Amanda to be some sort of dark spiritual dancer before she got ill. She causes pain to herself. Tries to do sexual acts with strangers. Trying to find a sign from god.It is a slow moving direction which can be boring at times with nothing happening. Morfydd Clark and Jennifer Ehle performances are good.The film is more psychological than horror which lacked scares. Does have some unsettling scenes. Focuses more of a character possibly losing her mind. With a slow direction.",Saint Maud
12,eddie_baggins,A slow-building religious themed horror,7,14 April 2021,"In a year not exactly jam-packed with high quality genre offerings, independent British horror Saint Maud saw itself become one of 2020's biggest festival and critical darlings, as Rose Glass's competent debut exploring faith and mental illness made its mark with an unnerving exploration of the deteriorating mindset of religiously driven nurse Maud.Played in a star-making fashion by its break-out performer Morfydd Clark, Maud is an Arthur Fleck like lost soul who believes she communes directly with God and has a mission to save lost souls she may come across, perhaps born out of a traumatic experience from her recent past as a nurse.This ""mission"" Maud believes she is on remains front and centre throughout her new role as Jennifer Ehle's dying Amanda's stay at home hospice nurse, as the two very different woman forge an uneasy friendship that can never end well with Maud's belief and Amanda's unbelief.A quiet horror and one that revels in its almost constant unease rather than out and out scares (of which there aren't many, but they hit hard when they arrive), genre buffs or more casual horror hounds heading into Saint Maud expecting a stereotypical horror or one filled with gore, frights and twists will be left sorely disappointed with Glass and her leading lady far more concerned with examining Maud's fragile mindset and internal battles with faith rather than easy genre wins.The slow pace and lack of scares will no doubt leave some viewers left disappointed by Saint Maud's hyped existence and there is a case to be made that some of the films more ponderous early sections could've ramped up events ever so slightly but in the films latter stages there's a captivating horror and beauty to where Maud's journey is taking us and Glass shows her hand as one of the brightest new talents in the industry.Backed by some captivating work from first time feature D. O. P Ben Fordesman (a scene involving a levitating Maud goes down as one of 2020's most iconic singular film moments), Saint Maud is a well designed calling card for Glass and her creative team and while much of the film is confined to Amanda's lonely hilltop house and the small seaside town that lays close by, there's never a feeling of confinement in this confident film that walks its own walk in a crowded horror marketplace.Final Say -More flat out nerve wrecking than downright scary, Saint Maud may not be the film some of its plaudits or promos have made it out to be but this is a memorable calling card for its debut director and the stepping stone for actress Morfydd Clark's leap to the big time.3 1/2 comfy pairs of shoes out of 5.",Saint Maud

14,jtindahouse,Good things come to audience members who wait,7,4 February 2021,"Nearing an hour into 'Saint Maud' I remember thinking to myself that time was seriously running out for stuff to start happening. At only 84 minutes long the film is incredibly patient in its build up. We are following a young girl, who in all fairness isn't very likeable. We can tell she's troubled and conflicted for sure, but that isn't always enough to keep a character watchable. I think this movie is going to lose a lot of people before it gets to the good stuff, and that's a real shame - because the good stuff is really good.In fact the incredibly slow build up is what I think makes the good stuff so good. When the film all of a sudden hits you with a sledge hammer, it's so out of the blue that the impact is doubled. I don't get frightened by films very often at all, but this one got me good. My heart was still racing 20 minutes later. The last 15-20 minutes of 'Saint Maud' is extremely dark.I'm going to be very interested in how the general public perceive this film. Not everyone has equal amounts of patience and I can see some people getting very fed up. The saying 'Good thing's come to those who wait' very much applies here. Stick around and the end of this film will give you a real treat.",Saint Maud

Our hero does some extremely painful self abuse to suffer for her sins. We Catholics have been taught to offer up our pain to Jesus. The writer uses this as a basis for the storyline.

Amazon Prime after originally being scheduled for theatres and missing out due to the pandemic (we were very excited to catch this and crushed by the pandemic delaying it). The storyline focuses on a woman with a tragic past who becomes a home aid for a former artist that is slowly dying. The artist throws various parties and has friends that the home aid doesn't agree with. One night, both the home aid and woman are touched by god leading to the home aid becoming obsessed with saving the woman's soul. This movie is directed by Rose Glass in her directorial debut and stars Morfydd Clark (Crawl), Jennifer Ehle (Zero Dark Thirty) and Lily Frazer (The Gentlemen). The storyline for this is interesting and slow paced. It takes a little while to get ramped up as you watch Maude lose her mind and grip on reality. I loved the use of Coney Island as a backdrop and the cinematography of the city and area was magnificent. There are some really well done and executed scenes including the sex scene, bed exorcism ending, firework/levitation sequence and the sneakers make me cringe every time. The ending fire sequence was an outstanding way to wrap this picture up. Overall, this isn't the masterpiece I was hoping for but was still a fun viewing. I'd score it a 6.5-7/10.",Saint Maud
17,parry_na,"Mood, atmosphere and weirdness.",9,8 September 2021,"At first I was reticent about watching 'Saint Maud'. A horror film concerning a terminally ill woman seemed too depressing (and too reality-based) a premise for my liking. Jennifer Ehle plays Amanda Köhl, and it is true she enlists the help of her 'little saviour' Maud (Morfydd Clark) to look after her through her final weeks and days - but that's only part of the story.The inclusion of Maud's strict religious beliefs also sounded alarm bells for me. All too often, religious types are presented as fanatics, perverts and/or murderers, and that is a plot point I find not only predictable but lazy in its exploiting of an 'easy target'. Amanda mocks the idea of religious belief, but there's no laziness here. None of the characters are black and white; with the aid of clever writing and exemplary playing, you believe in them entirely - but none of them are predictable or easy to like. Things are more complex than that.Despite my misgivings - misgivings that reinforce the belief that it's best to go into any film blind - I absolutely loved 'Saint Maud'. In this astonishing debut feature Rose Glass has created a world within a world - a world of abject loneliness and exclusion, of the fragility of human beings and the casual unkindness of others. Not that Maud is easy to sympathise with - initially she is pious and judgemental, but then, we are all flawed. Amanda wants to live her last days as a reflection of her exotic past, whereas by all accounts she was, as the departing nurse at the beginning of the film points out, 'a bit of a c***.'Most of the location filming took place in Scarborough, I was delighted realise (it's a favourite place of mine) although - apart from the giveaway 'Coney Island' gambling emporium - many of the background details are blurred out, giving the impression that this is just another seaside town.This won't appeal to everyone. CGI lovers and jump-scare addicts may not find enough to hold their attention, but this is about saturation levels of mood, atmosphere and a very definite weirdness. I look forward to seeing more of Rose Glass's productions. My score is 9 out of 10.",Saint Maud

19,drownnnsoda,An incisive portrait of loneliness,8,13 February 2021,"""Saint Maud"" follows the titular Maud, a young hospice nurse in a small, dreary English seaside village who takes a job caring for Amanda, a cancer-stricken, middle-aged American dancer and bon vivant living in a secluded mansion on the hillside. Maud, a recent Catholic convert prone to her own bizarre visions, comes to believe that caring for the dying Amanda is her mission and purpose--a soul to save. But at what price?This insular and occasionally shocking feature debut by director Rose Glass is, though marketed as a horror film, really more a psychological examination of abject loneliness and descent into madness. In some ways, it feels like it could have been written first as a novel, and that's part of what makes the film unique. The film's largest achievement is that is successfully operates on a number of levels, functioning as a meditation on loneliness, a portrait of a nervous breakdown, a hagiographic tragedy, as well as (possibly) a demonic possession story.Ultimately, at its base level, ""Saint Maud"" is a character study reflected between the two dichotomous central characters: Maud, the lonely, psychologically-fragile nurse obsessed with matters of the spirit; and Amanda, a woman who has lived for the pleasures of the flesh (the fact that she was a dancer, a profession strongly appertained with the physical body, is no symbolic coincidence). Their philosophical clashing of perspectives ultimately shatters Maud, though she manages to rebuild her absolution in a terrifying way. Both characters are delicately portrayed by Morfydd Clark and Jennifer Ehle, respectively, and the film would not work without the strength they bring to each.All in all, this film is a dour portrait of both mental decline and spiritual ecstasy, depending on how one wants to look at it. Glass puts forth her own take in the film's final frame, which almost veers too far into hokey territory, but in the end, ""Saint Maud"" manages to be a potent (and depressing) examination of one person's tragic search for purpose. 8/10.",Saint Maud

21,Pairic,Dark Reigious Mania,8,6 December 2020,"Saint Maud: This dark psychological drama is very much a film of two parts. Starts off with Maud (Morfydd Clark) taking a job as a live in carer for Amanda (Jennifer Ehle). a dancer who has terminal spine cancer . Maud is filled with religious fervor and wants to save Amanda's soul as well as provide palliative care. Amanda smokes, drinks, wants to live a hedonistic lifestyle during her final days. Maud disapproves but they reach a modus vivendi for a time. Eventually though Maud's reverence coming up against Amanda results in a worrying clash. After this the film takes off in the direction of horror. Much of what then occurs is filtered through Maud's perceptions but is she a reliable narrator? While the horror is mostly psychological there are a few violent and disturbing scenes. The narrative is very much driven by Maud's religious conviction, she sees herself as akin to the Saints, an incipient martyr. There is a frisson of apprehension as this movie heads towards it's denouement. Written and Directed by Rose Glass. Showing at the Irish Film Institute, Dublin. 8/10.",Saint Maud
22,andrewchristianjr,CREEPY AND ATMOSPHERIC.,8,7 February 2021,Creepy and atmospheric. Slow burn psychological horror. A really compelling blend of trauma and religion mixed with body horror in a way I've never really seen before. Mental illness is not a joke!,Saint Maud
23,3xHCCH,Mental Disturbance Spiked With Religious Fanaticism,8,7 July 2021,"Morfydd Clark's performance of Maud was incredible achievement in acting. Clark actually transformed into this mentally-disturbed woman who was experiencing the horrors of a guilt-tormented soul. She only spoke very little, and if she did, she was speaking with God. Maud's prayers, from her fervent adoration of His glory, her desperate questioning of His purpose for her to her perceived understanding of her divine mission, served as the film's narration.Aside from being intensely contemplative and psychologically demanding, this role was also a very physically exhausting one for Clark, . Maud was inflicting wounds on herself -- her hands and her feet, all symbolizing of her psychiatric breakdown from a traumatic past experience. Maud's climactic confrontation scene with the bedridden Amanda was truly horrific, and we see it all transpire from Maud's distressingly distorted point of view.This dark and depressing British indie film may not be for everybody, but it was certainly a triumph for writer-director Rose Glass in her feature film debut. With Glass's inspired choices in cinematography, editing and musical score, even the most mundane scenes were all shrouded by a tense atmosphere dripping with a sticky sense of claustrophobic discomfort. That final scene on the beach was glorious and ghastly at the same time! 8/10.",Saint Maud

The more I thought about it, the more I realized how everything fit together and that there were many little details that added to the story. For a movie that isn't very scary, I would still consider this a horror movie based on the content.",Saint Maud
25,I_Ailurophile,"Superb, twisted, slow-burn thrills",8,27 May 2021,"I had fairly high expectations, and for a time while watching I was beginning to wonder if I'd been led astray. But with the final act comes clarity, and revelation: 'Saint Maud' is delightfully dark, and well worth the ride.This is nothing if not a vehicle for Morfydd Clark. 'Saint Maud' is wholly built around Maud, centering her perspective of events, and Clark fills the role with aplomb. Writer-director Rose Glass, in her excellent screenplay, pens the nurse as a quite willful young woman; Clark gives her a force of personality that's disconcerting. As faith turns a corner to become zealotry, our star greatly embodies the proud, stubborn devotion, and a cold dismissiveness toward others' perceived lack of piety.Clark inhabits her role so well, and it's entrancing to watch her as events unfold. The simple premise suggests great emphasis on the relationship between Maud and her charge, and while this is true, it's also misleading. 'Saint Maud' focuses squarely on the protagonist, whether or not she is in the same space as her temperamental patient (Jennifer Ehle, fantastically embracing Amanda Kohl's cynicism and last ounces of joie de vivre). Every moment of resolve, doubt, supplication, or initiative is played out with reverent consideration of the character's state of mind, and the lingering gaze of the camera captures every nuance of Clark's portrayal.Fascinating as it is to watch the tangle of Maud's characterization unfold in her journey, somewhere in the second act I began to doubt the trajectory of the film. It didn't entirely seem like what I had supposed, and at the same time that Maud was wandering from her purpose in the film, so my favor wandered. Yet this was just the calm before the storm, because once Maud gains renewed confidence in what she sees as her mission, the tension ramps up quickly in the rush to the climax.And that brings us to the ending. The perfect, exquisite ending. 'Saint Maud' spends its entire length documenting the course of events as Maud perceives them. Even through that lens we get a disturbing image of the character's psyche as her escalating religious fervor collides with reality around her. Abnormal occurrences in various scenes suggest that there's unmistakably something special about the protagonist, one way or another, until ultimately - in the literal last moment of the movie - all is revealed.That final illumination puts a fresh spin on 'Saint Maud,' and dispels any doubts about its craft. Every preceding minor point of tension, every anomaly that Maud observed as a sign from god, and the very relationship between caregiver and patient is slammed through a refined filter.This is bold and brilliant. The spotlight on Maud, and her every behavior, make the movie captivating, and thrilling as emotions intensify, priming the audience all the more for the stunning finish. 'Saint Maud' is a fine film, well worth 84 minutes of anyone's time.",Saint Maud
26,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Haunting Tale of Religion, Madness and Mentally Instability",9,2 March 2021,"This was one of my more anticipated films for 2020. Due to the Covid pandemic, this of course got pushed back into 2021 where Jaime and I watched it at home through streaming as part of our Valentine's Day plans. If you were curious and do not know, it is an Epix Exclusive. It is a bummer we couldn't see it in the theater, but still glad to finally view this. The synopsis here is a pious nurse who becomes dangerously obsessed with saving the soul of her dying patient.We start here with an interesting way of introducing our main character. She goes by the name of Maud (Morfydd Clark), but later we get revealed that it is really Katie. Something happened while she was working a hospital and it resulted in a patient dying. To get back on her feet, Maud is taking on a job as a hospice nurse for a former dancer and choreographer named Amanda (Jennifer Ehle). I did want to include here that hospice might be a bit different in the United Kingdom where this takes place from what Jaime was telling me. Amanda has cancer, but the care she is getting does seem like it could prologue her life, if she wants that.The two have a bit of a rocky start where Amanda mocks Maud. The more they spend time together, the more Amanda starts to buy into doing some things that her more religious nurse is doing. It does come off as a mocking her at first, but she does seem to get some reprieve from it as well. Amanda though has a young woman named Carol (Lily Frazer) that visits her. I thought she was a prostitute when I first saw her, but it does seem like she is more of a sugar baby. Maud tells her to stop coming around as she is interfering with the saving of Amanda's soul at this critical time in her life.Maud has her fall from grace due to this. Amanda mocks her at a party in front of her guests and this causes Maud to strike her. Maud loses her job and seems to lose her purpose as well. Through Joy (Lily Knight), a former co-worker, we learn that Maud used to be a bit wild and then had a psychotic break at work. She turned to religion which did seem to help. We see that Maud could possible be visited by religious presence, which Amanda seemed to feel as well. Or is she having another breakdown?Now that is where I want to leave my recap of this movie. What really intrigued me coming into this was that I saw the trailer. I tried to avoid them, but this one I couldn't help when I went to see movies with Jaime. I also saw that it had a low running time of 84 minutes. What I'm getting at here is that there isn't a lot to the story, but it is really about this young woman and her mental state.That is where I think I want to start here. Despite this movie's short running time, I think it does some really good things with giving us back-story without force feeding it and filling in gaps with things that we're seeing. Like we know there was a mental break and something horrific happened pretty early on involving Maud. It is interesting is that is the first thing we learn about her. Clark's performance as this character really sells it as well. She comes off as mousey and not confident in herself. I mean there is good reason. She has her religion, which gives her strength. It doesn't help that she is mocked for it though. There is mentally instability here for sure.There is the idea that Maud could be visited by angel, God or even a demon. What I think works here is how it is presented. Maud has these moments where her skin will pull and distort how she looks. It does feel like an unseen entity is causing this. Jaime brought up the good point that it could also be her having a seizure. We are mostly seeing things from Maud's point of view so it isn't the most reliable either. Regardless, what I like is that it only happens when there is no one else to see it. She does also hear a voice that seems to be speaking in Latin, but turns out from what I read to be Welsh. It is just distorted in a way to make it creepy. It is pretty unnerving. To add to her religious experiences, Maud is doing things that harm her physically. This makes me think of St. Thomas More who felt that to be in constant pain was to be closer to God. We get some pretty cringey things here that were effective for me. I do like that the end of the movie gives you a look at the truth and it completed it for me.Since I've already talked about Clark's performance, I want to shift to the rest of the cast. This is really a character study of Maud with those around her pushing her to where she ends up. Ehle is solid as this woman who seemed to have everything, but has given up on life due to her health failing. Maud wants to help her. The problem is that she doesn't want to help herself. She wants to enjoy the pleasures of life and give up. Knight gives us a glimpse into the old Maud, or I guess Katie. There's an interesting scene where Maud reaches out to her and Katie is unable to join her. This sinks our main character into more of a depression. Frazer is also good in causing stress in Maud's life that leads to her downfall. The rest of the cast also helps round this out in my opinion.Where I want to go next would be the effects. We actually get a fair amount, but the movie doesn't necessarily rely on them. There are some practical ones like what Maud puts into her shoe. This is aided by the sound design actually. The movie does use CGI, but it is to accentuate things. If I study it, I could tell it was done with computers, but how they used it was effective for me. Overall I'd say this was well done in building more of the horror elements. The cinematography, especially for the ending sequence, was well done on top of that.In conclusion here, I tried my hardest to not come in with high expectations, but regardless there were some there. I think this movie gave me exactly what I wanted it to. We are toeing the line here of whether something supernatural is happening or if this is someone who has a mental break. I think the performance from Maud really sells either side of the explanation. The rest of the acting helps to push her to where she ends up. I think the effects were effective. The sound design and soundtrack worked for me as well. This is a good movie in my opinion. It will be one that I plan to rewatch before the end of the year to see where I ultimately fall on it.",Saint Maud
27,jadepietro,She's Got Fervor,7,22 June 2021,"IN BRIEF: Disturbing yet confusing vision of mental illness that is one part psychological study and one part horror film.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Beware of those religious fanatics, those extremists who share the words of God as a weapon to conquer all non-believers. The title character in Rose Glass' gripping and unsettling directorial debut, Saint Maud, is a recent convert to Catholicism, a hospice nurse tending to a new patient and more worried about her soul than her physical well-being.After a harrowing hospital experience with a dying patient, Kate (Morfydd Clark) seeks spiritual refuse and renames herself Maud. Wanting to start anew, Maud becomes a private care nurse and is assigned to Amanda (Jennifer Ehle) a terminally ill cancer patient living in an English seaside town who happens to be an atheist. A sermon approaches, especially after Maud sees Carol, a constant visitor of Amanda, whom provides sex for a price. One day, Amanda goes too far showing her atheist tendencies and unwisely mocks her religious fervor at a party, calling Maud ""my savior"". But Maud will have none of that skepticism. God will guide her and both will forgive and save Amanda too. The fight for salvation is on!Part psychological thriller and part horror film, we see the story solely from Maud's demented point of view. Lights flicker as she has seizures while speaking to God. A crucifix falling becomes a tell-tale omen to her. She views Amanda's lesbianism which she spied upon as a ""sinful"" acts in her mind. Tensions mount. However, there is no sense of reality on display and accuracy is at a minimum as nurse takes over the role of protector. Through most of the film, the surreal and off-kilter images, while powerful, still place the moviegoer at a confusing crossroads of what is real and what isn't.As they bond together, the film has an ominous feeling of dread. Writer/ Director Ms. Glass builds the suspense most effectively. She relies heavily on voiceover narration to explain Maud's thoughts and behavior as a means of clarification, but that is not always successful in her storytelling.Both actresses are excellent. They create very well defined characters. Ms. Clark downplays the showy title role and blends the role of victim and predator very adroitly. Her character's madness is convincingly realized. Ms. Ehle shows the bitterness of a dying and vein woman with the utmost subtlety.For the most part, this psychological thriller becomes a finely-drawn character study and a disturbing portrait about mental illness. But in the film's third act, it becomes obvious that Maud has slipped further into madness for everyone, including the audience, to witness. This is when the movie goes full bonkers into the horror genre and overindulges in its gore and scare tactics. The overwrought atonal music does not help matters as it pulsates, booms, and bellows too eerily, becoming a clichéd distraction that one continually hears in many standard horror films. It all leads to a shocking conclusion, one that may not satisfy many moviegoers.Conceptually similar to the fire and brimstone antics of Hereditary, The Witch, Midsommer, or First Reformed, Saint Maud (the movie) is bi-polar too. While I enjoyed the well-handled psychological thriller aspects of the film, the demonic horror trappings were run-of-the mill cheap thrills, unbecoming of the talented Ms. Glass. Religion may be a double edged sword and Saint Maud cuts very deeply. Too bad it overplays its hand and eventually falls victim to its own excesses. (GRADE: B-)",Saint Maud
28,vengeance20,Boring with little to no pay off,2,10 October 2020,"Only seen a trailer of this a week or so before watching & to be honest it actually looked the business.The film follows a young maid/nurse who looks after this woman who she thinks believe in god as she does so religiously. After a clash she ends up being kicked out & then discovers the woman she once looked after wasn't a true believer in god after all.The film for the most part was boring. Sorry not sorry but it was. The end while it had some ""horror"" elements in it was in itself a bit flat & uninteresting. The films narrative, dialogue & pacing was incoherent & lost, which made it harder to follow what the main protagonist goals were never mind the antagonists plans were.The only good was the ending which sad to say was actually good to be fair. 3/4 of the film was just plain dry boring & uninspired. Rose whatshername needs to write & direct better scripts.Overall, this film is way too over-hyped & flat out boring. 2/10",Saint Maud
29,begob,Flares out in horror,7,27 February 2021,"A nurse with a troubled past takes on a job caring for a dying dancer, when the voice in her head calls for the salvation of the patient.Well assembled psycho-drama. The story doesn't cover much ground - a fleeting flashback to a mysterious event, a relationship formed and broken, and the inevitable consequence - so that's reflected in the shortish runtime. The editing and pacing are good, so it all fits just right.The lead performance is excellent, and well supported in the character of the invalide dancer. There are good touches of erotic rapture, so the performances sustain interest in a solemn atmosphere, but the possibility of two women orbiting each other in celestial ecstasy isn't pursued. Toward the end I was resigned to a well-observed take on religious psychosis, no more than the sum of its parts. There is a pub scene at the midpoint that might have reached for the crazy, but it stuck to straightforward images and camera.Blake's spiritual engravings are introduced early on, but that just goes in parallel with the delusions of the protagonist without winding into her character, and after a promising scene with a body suspended in air leads no further than an underwhelming crisis, when we hear the voice in the protagonist's head (Old Welsh, I guess - the couple of uses of distorted voice are a bit cheesy). Another influence comes with flashes of the patient's past as a dancer, which has all sorts of possibilities to convey the horror, but I didn't feel it.But in the final ten minutes the movie takes flight, when the director at last hits the screen with images showing the insanity, rather than treating its symptoms. Those three scenes do rely on CGI, but the technique is unusual and effective, giving a blast of perverted sanctity. So we do get there in the end, even though I felt it would have been made more powerful by really folding in the tropes of Blake and the darkling dancing early on.The music is always interesting, but I'm still waiting for the horror movie that integrates music and, in this case, dance with its base concept, rather than using it just for effect. The cinematography is sympathetic to the location, and sometimes uses odd angles, but for the most part brief CGI is needed to signpost the otherworld.Overall: Strong drama that flares into horror at the end.P.s. There's a credit for Nancy the cockroach, followed by the assurance - No animals were harmed in the making of. Probably ""resting"" these days, what with the lockdown and all.",Saint Maud

35,gedikreverdi,Beware of your little savior!,8,4 February 2021,"We don't know what exactly happened in the hospital she was working with. We saw her with bloody hands and a dead woman in a dilapidated hospital room. But his coworker Katie told her it wasn't her fault so probably she died in her care. She then starts working as a private carer for a woman named Amanda who has cancer at terminal stage. She has a beautiful house at the top of a hill. Amanda was a former dancer and her lover carol visited her and they made love and maud was very displeased with that as she thought they had bigger things to deal with like helping Amanda being found and she tried to convince her of that but carol showed up at Amanda's birthday party and Amanda along with her friends mocked her because they thought she's a bigot or she's simply jealous of them and maud slapped Amanda and was fired. Back to his gloomy and very humble little flat, she was in pain because she expected to be more special than this as she was a true believer. She had sex with random guys and dis everything against her belief and she repented and suspended in the air in her room. At one night god talked to her after in a language that sounded like Hebrew after she saw that black insect creeping around in her room. He told her that she already knew what she had to do. Her friend Katie visited her in her room and it was really disturbing how she lost contact with reality as looking up in the sky from her window and saw clouds gathering while her friend was keeping a one sided conversation. She then went to the house of Amanda and broke in. Her health seemed to have worsened and she said she forgave her but as she wanted to bless her, she said god didn't exist and maud saw her as the raging devil and crushed against Amanda's toilet mirror. Then she took a pair of scissors and stabbed her in the chest and in her neck. And then in the morning she saw she grew a pair of angel wings. She went out dressed as a saint and walked on the beach. She poured down the bottle of hydrogen peroxide on her as she looked up in the eye of the storm. People around her wanted to stop her but she set herself on fire as she saw everyone bent their knees before her, saint Maud. It was a slow burn and it was definitely worth watching. Jennifer Ehle in particular did a great job with her character.",Saint Maud
36,blott2319-1,"Wonderful movie, if it's your kind of thing",4,6 August 2021,"Mental illness plus religious fanaticism is probably a good recipe for a horror film, and I'm sure people who enjoy horror will find Saint Maud to be a success. That is unless you are a person who is looking for a lot of jump scares in your horror movies. This movie has only one of those moments as I recall, and otherwise thrives more on the general creepy atmosphere and unsettling images. To people who want to be startled, I could see this movie being downright boring most of the way through. As someone who does not enjoy horror all that much, I was a bit turned off by the entire experience no matter what brand of scares it provides. I'll admit that I was riveted throughout the entire movie, because I never knew what Maud might do next, but when I saw what happened it wasn't exactly an enjoyable experience. There are 2 moments driven by Maud's psychosis that I found truly effective and powerful. I almost turned to the point where I was going to say this was a movie I kind of liked, and those were the scenes that convinced me this is a high quality film, even if it's not my cup of tea. I think that needs to be my final statement on Saint Maud, while it clearly doesn't line up with my personal taste, I see it as an excellently-made movie that accomplishes what it wants in a powerful way. In short, I admire it even if I don't like it.",Saint Maud

The horror witnessed in the film is probably in her head and we see what she sees. I think the murder was for real in the film. Perhaps that was the intensional moral of the story. To bring more awarenesses to mental illness. Ironically, people are more alone and reclusive than ever before because of technology. Some spiral deep into isolation and mental problems. What I don't think this film is about is religion despite the religious references. I can see the girl or man as obsessed with a political ideology and still fall into self-contaiment and isolation. You could still end up with the same outcome as in this movie.I did enjoyed it. Another good film from A24. Keep it up A24!",Saint Maud
40,bob-the-movie-man,"""My Little Saviour"": Astonishing Saint Maud delivers psycho-religious chills",9,6 October 2020,"Saint Maud is the debut feature from writer/director Rose Glass, and it packs a punch. The film was first seen at last year's London Film Festival, but was due for broader nationwide release soon. What a crushing disappointment it must be for Ms Glass that so few people will likely get to see it in the current climate... at least, not for a while. Since it is an effective little chiller.Maud (Morfydd Clark) is a palliative nurse looking after ex-choreographer Amanda (Jennifer Ehle). Maud is extremely religious and feels God move in her... regularly. Acting on His guidance, Maud sets out to save the soul of her ailing bohemian charge. But is Amanda beyond reach, and far will the zealot-like Maud go to achieve her goal?Morfydd Clark appears so young in this film that you would think this was her debut film. But she's actually 30 years old and has quite an impressive filmography already. Although this is her movie-lead debut, she's had a substantial part alongside Kate Beckinsale in the excellent ""Love and Friendship"" and smaller parts in ""Crawl"", ""The Personal History of David Copperfield"" and the fun ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"". She's likely to get more worldwide exposure soon as a young Galadriel in Amazon's new version of ""Lord of the Rings"".As Maud she is simply superb - expressing such a range of joy, hurt and despair that you must think a BAFTA Rising Star nomination should be on the cards.Clark is ably supported in the leading role by the splendid Jennifer Ehle, still so memorable to me as Elizabeth Bennett from the BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice"".Scarborough is also a star of ""Saint Maud"". The Yorkshire seaside town is another star of the movie. Clearly filmed before lockdown, the rainy and windswept resort looks bleak and unwelcoming. And that's before Covid! Many of those struggling bars and amusement centres, as in other resorts all around the UK, are now on their last legs.Adam Janota Bzowski supplies the impressively claustrophobic music, which deserves recognition. A scene with Maud, flicking a lighter rhythmically in time with the sonorous beat, is a masterpiece in musical choreography and editing (by Mark Towns).At the heart of this horror-thriller is whether, following a Dawkins-style argument, fervent religious followers are less insightfully correct and more mentally unstable and misguided. When is the voice of God just the voice in your head? And how would you tell the difference anyway? Piecing together the plot and motivations of Maud was intellectually challenging and rewarding.I always get a little tense and nervous when I see the word ""horror"" on a movie bill. I am NOT a great horror fan! But for me, as a 'horror movie', ""Saint Maud"" is of the 'horror-lite' variety. Highly watchable, it builds more in the way of creeping dread than cheap shocks. There were only a couple of jump-scares (but for me, the one in the finale was a doozy!).A BBC interview with Rose Glass I just saw says she relates Maud's relationship with God as like many people's relationship with social media. Always looking for support, guidance and affirmation. Interesting.This is also an obviously female-led picture. All the men are complete tools. no, really, literally they are. It makes me feel ashamed to be among their number.Overall, ""Saint Maud"" is a minor classic. I didn't go in with great expectations of this one, but I was pleasantly surprised. As a small British movie, it packs a punch significantly above its weight. When I came out I was at about a 7* rating. But this is one that really stayed with me, and I've subconsciously thought about little else all day. So for that reason I am going to escalate my rating to something more appropriate.You might struggle now to see it on the big screen, but if you can do so, it comes with a recommendation from me. I think this one could REALLY be a ""Marmite film"".... so if you see it, let me know what you thought with a comment on One Mann's Movies. (Thanks).",Saint Maud

'Saint Maud' thrives on ambiguity - is the main character really being guided by divine intervention, demonic possession, or delusion? It is a slow burn - A24 style, but an incredibly effective one at building the tension.

42,tonypeacock-1,Psychological thriller that has elements of classic films from the genre,8,3 February 2021,"Let me begin this review by saying from the start that Saint Maud is not a horror film in the traditional sense of jump scares galore, serial killers on the loose et al. It is more of a psychological quasi religous thriller.It follows the story of a character called Maud (Morfydd Clark). She begins the film as a timid looking individual a live in nurse/carer for a palliative care patient, 49 year old ex-dancer/choreographer Amanda Köhl (Jennifer Ehle).As the film develops we learn that Maud is not all that she appears. She speaks to God (or thinks she does) and has a strong Roman Catholic belief.
She thinks she is on some sort of mission caring for Amanda. To save her soul?We learn that Maud used to be called Katie and was involved in a tragic incident in her previous nursing job at the hospital.I say save her soul. Amanda gives the impression of being sceptical about Maud's devout beliefs even gifting her a book by William Blake!As the film develops we see Maud develop from this timid looking carer to a quite sexually promiscuous character when she goes out to a local club alone.As for dying Amanda she hosts house parties for her birthday and enjoys the company of a lesbian friend, Carol who Maud tries to keep away from Amanda earlier in the film.It is it her birthday party that Maud is humiliated and hits Amanda in a rage losing her job in the process.The lighting and sound effects are excellent and add an atmospheric ambience to the film as well as the location photography in Scarborough.As the film develops we hear Maud listening to a Godly voice and partaking in quite painful scenes of self-mortification including walking around Scarborough on shoes she has put drawing pins in the soles.The final act of the film is the most shocking as we at see further scenes that hark back to films such as Polanski's Repulsion (1965), The Exorcist (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976).Indeed the final scenes are some of the most thought provoking in modern independent cinema featuring murder and the ultimate sacrifice on a Scarborough beach.A good debut by Director Rose Glass.

43,killercharm,The ending that saved Coney Island,7,3 June 2021,"Wowee wow wow what an ending. Worth Every Minute. I have to admit it took me a second try to get hooked but second try I did, thank you lord. Saint Maud is the typical recent convert to most anything, i.e., she judges everyone else harshly and feels it well within her rights to smack them across the face whenever they need it. She can tell when they need it because they haven't swallowed her teachings whole hog. Some sort of sordid mars her record, of which we are told only enough to maybe incorrectly decide for ourselves what her record is. Because it really doesn't matter what the specifics are.

44,kuarinofu,A rather enjoyable psychological thriller,6,22 May 2021,"The film neither breaks new ground nor raises any previously uncovered themes, but overall it is shot and compressed quite tightly and well.The lead actress is well cast and overall plays it perfectly.The film could have been a little more interesting if we had learned more about the main character's past or more scenes of her interaction with other supporting characters.However, overall, the film is quite atmospheric and well suited for a one-time viewing experience.I wouldn't call it a horror, but rather a psychological thriller about loneliness and probably mental illness.Also, each time I saw Jennifer Ehle, she played Amanda, I couldn't help myself seeing younger Meryl Streep cause they are indeed so much alike.",Saint Maud
45,Movi3DO,A Brilliant Mockery disguised as a horror,9,5 June 2021,"Kami-sama? Answer me God. Yes....Back to the Christian high school days, I usually listened to speakers who had revelation from God, and heard His voice. Of course I found those ""transformative"" moments a load of rubbish. However, this movie took this idea to an extreme, and man it was brilliant.A slow burn story of a young woman descending into madness. The plot showed the progress of a new believer who had strong loyalty to God. The music, editing, and cinematography made for an atmospheric horror. The twist and ending, despite how shocking it was, was fitting and logical. It was a mockery at the extreme side of Christian belief while being an effective horror.Overall, even though some parts were a bit slow, the movie was incredible and brilliant. Keep listening to God. 9/10.",Saint Maud
46,Neptune165,Unclear until the last 5 minutes,3,12 February 2021,"This movie was very slow, had an unstable plot. While its another film from A24, IMO it's about as much of a horror film as The VVitch was, although I wouldn't hold it in the same high regards. It a slow burn that deals with mental illness, isolation, and destructive behaviors leading to a climax that lasts about 15 mins until the closing credits. Some may enjoy the storytelling but for me it wasn't anything that i haven't seen before. Watch at your own risk. How this film has so many positive reviews is beyond me. Just bad from start to finish. Not in the least bit scary, poor acting, awful CGI(especially the cartoon angel wings) and weak plot twist ending. More of a fantasy flick than a horror. Don't waste your time. Film was a little boring for me. I wish there was more to it but it's basically just watching a lonely woman lose her mind, commit murder and then suicide. didn't explain what was really happening. It just seems like it's a bunch of random scenes thrown together. It's just all so weird and frankly not scary until you get to the scene in the last 10 minutes. Kept on about what Maud did in the past yet never found out? Final scene was when it started to get good then it ended? Completely anticlimactic.",Saint Maud
47,Blue-Grotto,Spell-binding; female driven thriller in male dominated genre,9,15 September 2019,"""Tis better to be that which we destroy,"" claimed Macbeth ""than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy."" A young Christian hospice nurse, Maud, struggles with this notion when she is charged with taking care of cancer stricken Amanda. The pair are opposites save for arrogance and self-righteousness. ""Nothing worth trying comes easy"" is Maud's mantra, yet she gains little traction with Amanda. In doubt, desperation and loneliness, Maud doubles down on her distorted beliefs and spirals out of control.This tense and spell-binding film employs compelling techniques including pulse quickening ambient sound, funnel clouds that mirror Maud's disordered state of mind, sideways and upside-down camerawork to portray drunken delirium and more. A female perspective in this male-dominated genre is refreshing and fascinating. Morfydd Clark (Maud) and Jennifer Ehle (Amanda) are fantastic in their portrayals. An intriguing bit of information was revealed in the question and answer session after the film's shocking conclusion; Morfydd is Welsh and when she appears to speak in tongues, she is actually speaking Welsh that is slowed down enough to be almost unrecognizable. The production crew was careful not to dwell in one location so the setting might appear to be anywhere. Seen at the Toronto international film festival.",Saint Maud

Flashback or flash forward? You have to wait to find out.Just as with Norman Bates, you know that Maud/Katie is going to end up doing something horrible. Unlike with Hitchcock, that's the only thread of suspense, and also unlike Hitchcock, we get to share Maud/Katie's delusions, fantasies and hallucinations. For all I know of these, the depiction seems to be authentic. This may be why, as well as with the nursing theme, Saint Maud resembles a clinical docu-drama at times, rather than a thriller.There are several effective scenes, great photography, and subtle FX.

She's a carer looking after Amanda (Jennifer Ehle) who has lymphoma. Both women have a past. Amanda's as a successful dancer. Maud... well that's the arc of this story. A trauma has lead Maud to God. She's desperate for guidance, for purpose. Something she thinks Amanda needs too in her large seaside house full of faded creative decadence. It's not a welcomed intervention though and Maud is spurned, sending her spiralling to a dark dangerous place. Clarks performance is electric. Her near euphoric spiritual rapture and psychotic obsession writ large on screen, with clipped narration as she talks to God and in turn to us. This is Maud's voice, as she sees things. What's hidden though from both her in denial and to us are events that make her dangerous, both to herself and to Amanda. This is exactly the kind of horror I love. Claustrophobic and tense, with a rock solid backbone that sends shivers down your own. It's the sort of film that makes you squirm. Menacing. If not relatable, recognisable. Astonishing really. These actors are all new to me and no one drops the ball. This is writer director Rose Glass' debut feature too and the sound, oh my god the sound! Keep an ear out for Adam Janota Bzowski, his compositions here are like an nightmare inducing embrace, especially as Maud (I'll keep up the pretence of the name) unravels and we get a sense of what's lurking in her past. Too much time can be dangerous. A sponge, soaking up venomous religious texts, feeding her compulsion. Maud see's her calling. It's a blistering piece of cinema and although it does have a couple of weak moments, by enlarge it's magnificent.

52,ronakkotian,Expert storytelling from debutant Rose Glass,8,16 June 2021,"I've heard a lot of this film and have wanted to see it for the longest time. Having seen it now, I'm really excited for Rose Glass's second venture.Saint Maud is about Maud, a nurse that recently converted to Catholicism, who becomes obsessed with her latest patient, believing she has to save her soul.I was led to believe Saint Maud was a horror film but it turned to be a rather disturbing character study with a few horror elements. This is the debut feature film of Rose Glass and I'm dazzled by her storytelling. She opens up the film with a beautiful yet haunting scene that left many questions in my head. There are many moments like the opening that Glass leaves ambiguous to the audience, providing us with strange fantasy-like sequences that get us to question its actuality and Maud's mental state. What makes this extremely effective is Glass's decision to illustrate it through Maud's perspective entirely. The lack of an outsider's viewpoint builds up these questions we have regarding Maud's visions and the fantasy-like sequences that occur more frequently as the film goes on adds to the eerieness and tension. This leads to the incredible climax where the build up pays off in the final shot lasting one second showing an image that has stayed in my mind ever since I've finished it. I don't think I've ever seen a film revealed it all in the final shot and made me reevaluate the entire thing. It's a testament as to how brilliant of a storyteller Rose Glass is.Aside from the terrific story, each and every technical element contributes to the eerieness of the film. The haunting cinematography filled with dimmed lighting add to the darkness and the score is very strange which fits extremely well with the overall creepy tone that Glass sets from the beginning. Morfydd Clark delivers an outstanding performance as Maud. She is front and centre of the entire film and owns every single scene. She has a lot of talent to carry a film like this and I hope to see her more in the future. Despitw the film's very short runtime, what didn't work for me was the incredibly slow pacing.Aside from that one issue, Saint Maud was a strange film that truly managed to get under my skin. Rose Glass delves deep into many underlying themes here whether it's to do with mental illness, obsession or faith and she explored these ideas in such an evocative and atmospheric manner. I'm astounded this is her feature film debut. Filled with macabre imagery that's etched into my brain and expert filmmaking, Saint Maud is a definite watch.",Saint Maud

54,ridi-arahan,Our belief system need not be inflicted upon someone else who believes otherwise,8,12 March 2021,"What worked:
First of all I am pleasantly surprised by the movie. As a mental health professional, I can vouch for many of the scenes that is depicted regarding the features of the person. It's a well researched work about visual hallucinations and grandiose delusions., and quiet frankly I loved the work done on that area with minimal to no flaws. Now, as a movie viewer, I am equally impressed by the movie. The director did a great job assembling the team together of some fine filmmakers. The cinematography, editing, both sound and video mixing all adds up super fine making it a very enjoyable and entertaining watch. It's one of those movie that we can show in the film school regarding what and how to set a design, production as well as execution values.What did not work:
I would have loved it more if we knew little bit more about the main character Maud, maybe some extra scenes where the two nurses talk about the past. It's okay but just some concern because if she had some terrible history how is she allowed to work privately.
Final verdict: definitely recommended",Saint Maud

For me there was no story, not much writing, absolutely no character development and an ending that was extremely unsatisfying.Not exactly sure what the filmmaker was trying to say. I do not think she knew either. What she was experiencing was not religion, and it was not spirituality, it was just delusion, psychosis and and a bent nature.There was not really much of a horror element to this film, so I don't know why it's being called a good horror film. It was just more like a descent into psychosis. Spare yourself 2 hours, there's much better work out there.",Saint Maud
56,sweidman-28016,Horror With Truth Behind It,8,17 February 2021,"Here, but for the grace of God, goes Maud, a reclusive young nurse whose impressionable demeanor causes her to pursue a pious path of Christian devotion after an obscure trauma. Now charged with the hospice care of Amanda, a retired dancer ravaged by cancer, Maud's fervent faith quickly inspires an obsessive conviction that she must save her ward's soul from eternal damnation - whatever the cost. Saint Maud has finally reached the U.S. after it's release in the U.K. among other countries last fall. I have been eager to see this for a while now. I love a good A24 horror film because they have a certain style that you won't see from mainstream companies. Plus, a directorial debut is always something to be excited for, especially when it comes to an original horror film. Not everyone is going to be on board with Saint Maud. Rather than a hellish experience like Hereditary, this is more of a psychological-drama. Not till the third act does it get a full horror introduction. Also, some can get sensative when it comes to religion. Personally, I liked how it portrayed it. It shows different perspectives. In no way is it criticizing it, but it shows a perspective from an aethiest, a devoted Christian, and just an outside view in general. I could go into depth because there's so much in the script and symbolism that plays into the message, but that would take more time than you'd probably like. The script is clever in the way it uses voice-over. Usually I'm not a fan of voice-over, but it's used in a way where it's like praying. The script also poses deeper themes regarding religion (obviously) and lifestyle. And I love how it keeps us questioning the whole time. We know a little about Maud's past from a flashback, but it's never fully explained but instead implied. With the sparatic route that it takes in character decisions, you never know what is going to happen.Morfydd Clark is absolutely fantastic. Maud is a hard character to paly, I imagine, and she got an understanding and played the hell out of her. As an audience member, I can't seem to place a good explanation on Maud, but Clark just nailed it. There's a demonic nature behind her heavenly presence. Jennifer Ehle is great as well. Her character is making the most of her unfortunate circumstance, but that clashes with Maud's ideals. I just liked seeing Ehle play Amanda because she's an underrated actress. Watching is an intrancing experience. The cinematography looks stunning, the set design looks fantastic, and the score is conflicting. To further on the score, it's so demonic and intense, but then has moments that sound like it's from a hymne. A disturbing moment could happen, and then it will cut to the next scene and be so peaceful. It's inviting us to a dark story without trying to scare us away. Many will consider this to be entirely boring and not scary. I will admit there is a slow spot in the middle. Still, this is an engaging film. The final act is that dark moment that I needed. I love how the final moments are portrayed. Some may think it's too silly of a way to end, but I think it's just right. As indie horror movies come, this is one to check out. Most people have liked it and I think if you give Saint Maud a chance, even if that means researching afterwards, you may find a truth behind it.",Saint Maud

The direction is assured; restrained for most of the film, but not afraid to be more direct at the right moments. The central performance from Morfydd Clark is something special, but Jennifer Ehle also deserves much praise for her important and subtle turn as the woman Maud is sent to care for.

62,TwistedContent,"Rich, Brave and Compelling in Unappreciated Ways",8,6 February 2021,"And here I, at last and once again, meet the kind of horror movie that butters my bread just the right way. It is astonishing the variety of new horror filmmakers and their debuts, and their continuum, that we have been gifted during the last years, from Severin Fiala & Veronika Franz (""Goodnight Mommy"", ""The Lodge""), Robert Eggers (""The VVitch"", """"The Lighthouse""), Ari Aster (""Hereditary"", ""Midsommar""), etc., and now Rose Glass, with an equal force in probing for horror in the psyche of a human mind.""Saint Maud"" follows Maud, a devout, young nurse who works as a private carer, and becomes dangerously obsessed with saving the soul of her dying patient, Amanda Kohl. While the plot is admittedly short and, as many complain, plenty predictable, it is not that much the structure of the story or the amount of plot turns where the substance is at. ""Saint Maud"" is an exploration of a traumatized mind grasping for a safe ground, about absolute fanaticism and the dissimilarity between the beliefs of a religious mind and all others, about the relationship between faith and oneself, a young woman fighting and succumbing to deteriorating mental state, and a tale of loneliness. And a story of possession.It is truly an impressive and daring film debut, with Rose Glass orchestrating Maud's rise and downfall with much ambiguity, leaving all possibilities open. Is such a tunneled fanaticism a mental illness? Is God really speaking to her? Maud believes only the father in heaven can help her and the whole wicked humanity & she' sure God acts through her, touches her soul. The story is told almost entirely from Maud's perspective, so we see, through her, all the manifestations and sensations that find her in her lonely, routine life. Delusions, and not willingly perceived. Reality that has started to bend to adjust to these delusions. With only 80-minute runtime, Rose Glass is not in a hurry to confirm that Maud is a deeply troubled, mentally ill mind in need of help other than Gods. Much of the ground of ""Saint Maud"" is built from the relationship between Maud and Amanda. Maud admires Amanda for her strength, but believes her mind is shrouded in darkness and need of a holy touch, and the mission becomes clear when Amanda calls Maud her 'little savior'. Maud disapproves of certain Amanda's actions, like her sexual relationship with another woman, and eventually it boils up to conflict and Maud's crisis of faith. ""Revelation. Just in time."" ""Saint Maud"" is a powerful and psychologically exposed downwards spiral into uncontrollable depths of a person's mind. We are fragile.No less impressive are the aesthetical values and acting. Morfydd Clark stars in her first leading role, and does so as devoutly as her character is to God, it is a physical, demanding and impressive performance that should be recognized. Jennifer Ehle adds strength, compassion, humanism, a different pole from Maud's, as Amanda, an ex-choreographer suffering a stage four spinal lymphoma. ""Saint Maud"" is certainly a female-led movie, all the men characters are, frankly, idiots. It's a movie beuatiffuly shot and edited, every frame seems thought-through, and there are no hiccups in the visual language. Much respect goes out to Adam Janota Bzowski, responsible for the eerie, pulsating original score & its only his first full feature, great future is ahead.I see people arguing whether ""Saint Maud"" is a horror film, and I'd say for sure it is, but the horror can be more felt than seen. It is what the characters go through. And the finale was very effective in all regards of horror, in my opinion.It's admirable how much Rose Glass has put in 80 minutes, and I stand by that it is anything but an empty film, emotion can substitute for a lot. Movies like this one, that make your brain work for days after, are the reason I'm into cinema. My rating: 8/10.",Saint Maud

66,fciocca,An artsy film project that lacks on story telling and character development,4,17 March 2021,"I don't understand what this movie is about. I suppose that the director wanted to create something open for interpretation. My personal one is that Maud experienced a traumatic event that is never fully disclosed (even if you can guess what happened from some scenes), and to cope with it, she get closer and closer to religion that will drive her completely crazy.The problem is that this is just a artsy project where nothing really stand out. Main character is just flat, she is not interesting, as she does not have any kind of background, therefore I do not care about what she does and why she acts in a certain way. Rest of the cast is no better. The plot is poorly developed and there is basically nothing worth to be mentioned. At the beginning the film is extremely slow and I was almost giving up. From a technical perspective there are a few scenes that have an interesting photography, but nothing really peculiar and most of ideas are not even that original. Special effects are simple and effective.Actors were just okay, cannot say that I was impressed by any performance in particular, and I will for sure forget very soon whoever acted in this. Overall a pretty mediocre movie, that had his potential, if only director and writers made an effort in order to create the screenplay.

67,dr_clarke_2,Far more than just another psychological horror film,9,6 September 2021,"Rose Glass's feature debut Saint Maud was released in 2019 to critical acclaim and won her a British Independent Film Award for Best Director. However, it may have baffled some audiences when they first went to see it, since they may have been expecting something else entirely. The film was wildly advertised as a psychological horror, and whilst that may be technically true, inept advertising created a false impression of Misery with lesbians. In fact, it is something more nuanced, more intelligent and altogether more disturbing than the advanced publicity suggested: a character study of a mentally ill protagonist with a disturbing and tragic ending.Saint Maud sees the eponymous nurse assigned to care for terminally ill dancer Amanda Köhl, who pays a young woman named Carol to visit her at night for sex. Maud, who is a devout Catholic, becomes convinced that she has been chosen by God to save Amanda's soul and doesn't approve of her relationship with Carol. This is pretty much all that several previews revealed about the film, and it gives a woefully inadequate picture of what the film is really about. Because Maud isn't just some stock religious fanatic, but rather a complex and damaged young woman who is haunted by a previous failure to save the life of one of her charges and has started to hear voices in her head, specifically the voice of God.There's a sense of inevitably tragedy in the way the film unfolds, with Maud - who changed her name from Katie after the aforementioned death - seeking redemption by trying to save Amanda's soul, but misguidedly trying to judgementally enforce beliefs that the film implies she has desperately embraced as the result of a breakdown. When her attempts backfire she engages in self-destructive behaviour that culminates in her drunkenly flirting in a bar and being raped, a sequence that is intentionally hard to watch. By the time somebody actually reaches out to her with kindness, she is too far gone, entirely consumed by her own delusions and making one last doomed attempt to save Amanda, which leads to bloody consequences for the dancer and a stomach-churning unpleasant end for Maud at her own hand.Glass wrote the screenplay having been inspired by the idea of a young woman who hears voices, and her characterisation of the lonely, awkward and emotionally scarred Maud is the backbone of the film. We hear Maud's internal monologue, providing narration of a sorts. Through this, we learn of her piousness, her views and her emotions; Glass' masterstroke is juxtaposing Maud's thoughts with her actions, so that the audience sees one thing and hears another, gradually making it clear how intense and disturbed the character is; the voice over thus turns out to be a highly effective narrative technique rather than the lazy expository tool it could have been.Glass's cast is small and gives centre stage to Morfydd Clark, who is astonishingly convincing in the title role, whilst Jennifer Ehle gives a brittle performance as Amanda, who alternates between fear, bravado and cruelty as she faces her own mortality. Glass's direction brings a deliberately bleak feel to the film, with a visual aesthetic that is reminiscent of the creepiest of nineteen-seventies British film and television programs and benefits greatly from the windswept Scarborough location filming. Ben Fordesman's cinematography is quite beautiful, but also eminently capable of being unsettling, with askew frames and carefully chosen shots that reflect Maud's unravelling mental health.As the film becomes darker and Maud becomes more disturbed, the sparse but haunting soundtrack by Adam Janota Bzowski becomes darker, and Mark Towns' editing reflects the mood, increasingly making use of faster and faster cuts (including flashbacks to the death that haunts her), as Maud gets sacked after slapping Amanda and the film's structure mirrors her fracturing sanity. The ending is shockingly powerful, especially the fleeting final shot of the screaming Maud on fire, which stays with the viewer long after the credits roll. Saint Maud might not be what some viewers were expecting based on the advance publicity, but if anything it is better than the mere psychological horror they might have been expected and makes an arresting debut for Glass; her next feature film should be something to be awaited with great anticipation.",Saint Maud

Director: Rose Glass
Starring: Morfydd Clark, Jennifer Ehle, Lily Knight, Lily Frazer, etcOverall rating 87/100Saint Maud is about is about a care nurse who become scarily obsessed with saving the soul of her dying patients, Wow Saint Maud was a different kind of horror that was really intriguing and mostly executed well, so let's start talking about it.My first few positives would be the narration, interesting and likeable characters, themes and cinematography. I really enjoyed the narration from Maud's character, it gave more depth and understanding to the character of Maud, as well as filling in gaps with the plot and what Maud was thinking in those particular scenes, it was done right here, it was almost stretched out to being overused but for me was balanced very well in developing and moving the characters and plot along nicely. I also thought the characters were very interesting and likeable, the character of Amanda ( Jennifer Ehle) was very likeable and had loads of interesting qualities to her, she was incredibly independent and was infectious whenever she was on screen despite how ill she was, the character of Maud links into my next positive which is the themes portrayed within the film, the recurring theme of loneliness and turning to religion in your darkest times was explored very well and especially with the loneliness theme it almost became a dark character study based on this which I really loved. I also thought the cinematography was fantastic and very unique, the visual creativity considering it's low budget was excellent and really interesting, there was loads of visual metaphors and some fantastic shots that really impressed me.My next few positives would be the use of sound, building of tension and uncomfortable/scary tone. The film's use of sound was excellent, it's score built up tension well, and just the disturbing diegetic sounds and added performance from Morfydd Clarke made the film even more disturbing, the film also built up tension really well, the movie slowly built up more and more tension throughout and kept on teasing the audience with disturbing imagery making me on edge more and more, the movie also did an excellent job at lingering on the extra tense and uncomfortable scenes to really let it sink in, the movie also created as I previously mentioned a very uncomfortable/scary tone that worked very well. The movie slowly got darker and darker as Maud became more obsessed with her goal the movie was a different kind of scary not needing to rely on Jumpscares but more of a psychological horror that sticks with you.My few negatives for the movie for me would be the inconsistent scares in the first half, pacing issues and some repetitive plot points. For me the movie overdid the teasing of the more horror based tone and scares, this led to the tone being very unclear and slightly messy within the first half of the movie, but they fixed this in the second half but it's definitely still worth mentioning. I also found that there was some pacing issues, the movie sometimes moved at a very slow pace, which mean due to the tonal imbalance with the scares in the first half I lost interest in parts. Finally I also found that there was some repetitive plot points, once again continuing my issues with the first half, I felt like there was too many reused scenes that didn't add enough new plot everytime, the repetition of Maud and what she did with her job got tired after a while and it took a while for the movie to truly do something different with the plot.My final few positives would be the use of gore, the excellent script and fantastic performances. The gore used was fantastic, it was very sudden and unsettling and delivered the desired uncomfortable tone perfectly. I also thought the script here was excellent, the social commentary on faith, mental illness and even being alone and isolated was really clever and thought out and made me think. And finally the performances here were excellent. Jennifer Ehle was incredible in her role, with heaps of charm and likeability and I just loved how she delivered her lines of dialogue. But the true star of the movie was of course the lead role Morfydd Clarke. She was absolutely incredible, she showed so much versatility and depth to her performance, she was very believable and played the disturbing parts to her character very for a very believable, unsettling and powerful performance.Overall, despite a few issues with the first act. Saint Maud, is a different and unique kind of horror that I haven't seen before, with excellent performances, visual creativity and being so much more then just a generic horror, it makes you think whilst at the same time deeply unsettling you.",Saint Maud

72,deexsocalygal,Mediocre,5,18 February 2021,"So, there were so many different reviews here, fluctuating from spectacular to just blah & I love horror so I watched it. This movie is about a nurse named Maud who is deeply religious & wants a sign from God. She slowly gets more & more frustrated when she doesn't get the kind of response back from God she expects for her straight & narrow life & deep obedience to Him. She keeps mentally deteriorating losing jobs, friends, & finally commits suicide. There's only 1 very short horror scene in the whole movie & it's about 5 minutes long. She goes back to the house of the woman she was taking care of. As they're talking the woman tells her there's no God, starts laughing when this makes Maud cry, & turns into a demon. It's a very short scene. I do not recommend this movie.",Saint Maud
73,ExpendableMan,"""Never waste your pain""",9,26 October 2021,"British seaside towns can be unbelievably depressing, especially when it isn't summer. In 'Saint Maud,' Scarborough looks like the most miserable place you could possibly live; a decaying, windswept and perpetually overcast little hell hole. The sort of place people go to when they're ready to die.It's the place where Maud, a young palliative care nurse lives and works. She spends her days looking after Amanda, a former dancer now living with terminal cancer. Maud however, is probably not the best person to be working in the care services. She's an awkward and humourless woman, who seems to have a tenuous grip on reality as it is. Aside from the fact she has an appalling taste in footwear, she keeps getting messages from God...What follows is an unnerving, slowburn tale of psychological collapse. Saint Maud starts off feeling mildly uncomfortable, then grows increasingly unsettling at it goes on until you're squirming in your seat with tension. This isn't a horror film relying on jump scares, it's more like having an itch that won't go away and gets progressively worse with every minute that passes. And Morfydd Clark is excellent in the lead role. This won't be for everyone and some folks will definitely be put off, but I for one thought it was terrific. It makes a night out at the pub look horrifically bleak too.",Saint Maud
74,dommercaldi,Morfydd Clark Is Phenomenal Amidst The Other Positives,8,11 November 2020,"Pros:
1. The cinematography is great especially as it mirrors Maud (Morfydd Clark). It's rigid and purposeful when Maud is confident and assured in her faith, but it goes haywire and literally flips upside down as she loses control and faith.
2. The colour palette is gorgeous, particularly with the black of darkness used to emphasise and embolden said colours.
3. Jennifer Ehle (Amanda) delivers a terrific performance, with Morfydd Clark being phenomenal, especially with the physicality her role required.
4. The score is eerily ominous which seemingly pounds into your very body. It's excellent at increasing the tension.
5. The violence, which is mostly self-mutilation, is intense, itching and really uncomfortable.
6. The atmosphere is thick and suffocating with dread and horror which only increases as the film goes on.
7. The CGI mostly looks great and is inserted appropriately.
8. The scene with Amanda as the devil is utterly bone-chilling, terrifying and mesmerising.Cons:
1. The scenes with Maud having a crisis of faith and sinking into sexual degeneracy feel mostly pointless and needlessly prolonged.
2. The character of Maud isn't likable and is barely interesting. If her backstory had been expanded on, then this could have changed.
3. The CGI fire looked distractingly awful.",Saint Maud
75,tccandler,It wallows in misery...,2,3 February 2021,"By definition, horror movies are a lesser form of filmmaking. They can entertain, when done well, but that's about it.

Hopefully she's planning on being an addition to A24's little stable of horror directors for a while, because she easily holds her own next to Robert Eggers or Ari Aster. This could have been a fairly humdrum entry in the category of ""horror where you're not sure whether things are actually happening or the main character is just bonkers"", but damn did she ever keep things interesting with her weird cinematography and the tantalizing refusal to ever clarify exactly what's happening. But holy crap does it walk that line really well.And also...Morfydd Clark, MAN. Hopefully she's planning on...acting for a while, because she totally shines in this. Just being so...normal and shy for ages, almost to the point of you wondering how this is even a horror film, and then letting loose and you wonder how she ever wasn't creeping you out.Which does bring me to the biggest issue I had with this - the first 20 minutes or so are a little dull, and honestly not even really a horror film at all. What it ends up becoming is most definitely worth it, but maybe there should have been a few scenes implying that things aren't quite right before that point.But other than that, there's a lot to appreciate about this, including the score, god-DAMN the score. Couldn't think of anywhere else to mention it, but it is there, and it is amazing.And just a little sidenote for anyone who may have thought (like me) that the final shot did confirm whether or not certain things were really happening...it may not be as clear cut as you thought.

The main character is a nurse. We are eventually made aware that she has made a mistake in her previous workplace, but it is uncertain what this is. We also do not know where she comes from, background. It meager presentation of her as the main character. The film is at its best in the scene where the nurse and the patient get to know each other. It soon becomes clear that this will not be a normal patient - nurturing relationship. But I do not think it will be particularly exciting or engaging. The film has good performances from the actors, but I think it lacks progress. In my opinion, it becomes largely lingering, and slow. That does not mean that it is a bad movie, but it did not capture me despite the fact that I think it was an interesting script, which perhaps could have been developed into something more?",Saint Maud
81,Bertaut,"Emotionally ambiguous, thematically complex, aesthetically daring - an exceptionally accomplished directorial debut",9,12 March 2020,"Is religious fanaticism a form of mental illness? Certainly people such as Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett would argue it is. However, from the perspective of the fanatic, such fanaticism is often not only logical and justified, but unavoidable; they don't choose to be fanatical, they are compelled to be fanatical. The disparity between what a fanatic believes and what other people believe is the main issue examined in Saint Maud, the stunning debut feature from writer/director Rose Glass. Part-horror, part-psychological thriller, part-character drama, part-ecclesiastical treatise, Saint Maud can be read in a variety of ways - an analysis of the interaction between faith and self; a threnody for the life of a young woman suffering a mental breakdown; a drama about loneliness; a tale of possession; a tragedy about the frailty of the human body. Told mainly (although not entirely) from the perspective of a fanatical Christian, the story makes room for the possibility that, however unlikely, such fanaticism isn't mental illness at all and that God really is communicating with this person. And this magnificently handled ambiguity is the film's trump card. Disturbing, horrifying, challenging, unpredictable, emotional, and occasionally very funny, this is a film that forges a path entirely its own, and is as impressive and daring a directorial debut as you're ever likely to find.In a thoroughly depressing English seaside town, Maud (an incredibly physical performance from Morfydd Clark) is a recent convert to Roman Catholicism. Exceptionally devout, she believes that mankind is amoral, lustful, and wicked, and that only by way of a true saviour can we be saved. Is she that saviour? It's possible, because God has explicitly told her that He has very special plans for her in the near future. Meanwhile, Maud is working as a private palliative care nurse, and the story begins as she arrives for her first day with Amanda Köhl (the always brilliant Jennifer Ehle); a formerly world-famous American dancer and choreographer suffering from end-stage spinal lymphoma. She and Maud get on well - Maud admires her strength of character and zest for life, whilst she wants to help Maud let her hair down a little. However, there are certain elements of Amanda's life of which Maud does not approve; most significantly, the frequent visits from Carol (Lily Frazer), Amanda's lover. When catastrophe strikes and a dark secret from Maud's past threatens to resurface, Maud decides to prove to Amanda, God, and everyone else just how far mankind has fallen and just how sanctified she really is.Although Maud is a hard-line fundamentalist, Glass refuses to dismiss her, arguing instead that such individuals genuinely believe they really are communicating with the Divine - Maud may be mentally ill, but even if that is the case (and the film is in no rush to confirm that it is), then surely she deserves compassion and kindness, so completely has her mind bent reality to support her delusion. Glass tells much of the story from Maud's subjective perspective, and in this sense, it's almost understandable when she sees signs of God's presence in everyday things (an inexplicable whirlpool in a glass of beer, for example) - this may be delusion, but if it is, it's a total delusion that she is powerless against. In a very real sense, she cannot be held accountable for her actions.Even irrespective of mental health issues, however, Maud is all-in on the whole Catholic thing. She tells God, for example, about how important her work is, as it allows her to ""save souls"" and she credits her recent conversion to Catholicism as reversing the downward spiral of her life. She's also a firm adherent of the Job school of faith-by-suffering, cheerfully telling a beggar, ""never waste your pain"" and later engaging in some truly gnarly DIY shoemaking.Along the same lines, she tolerates Amanda's little digs about her life and how lonely she seems, but when Amanda turns her caustic wit to Catholicism, Maud is unable to let that stand without offering rebuke. Her relationship with Amanda forms much of the film's narrative backbone, with neither woman allowed to occupy the moral high-ground. Amanda is profoundly bored with her illness, and her isolation and inability to leave the house mean she seizes on this strange, ultra-serious young woman who has come to look after her. Amanda is not a villain any more than Maud, but she does regard Maud as a plaything, not with the intention of hurting Maud, but with the intention of amusing herself.As strong as Saint Maud is thematically, however, where it really excels is in its aesthetic design. Glass directs the hell out of it, and there's not a weak link amongst her crew - from Ben Fordesman's murky cinematography to Paulina Rzeszowska's detailed production design to Paul Davies's oppressive sound design to Adam Janota Bzowski's creepy score to Mark Towns's ambiguous editing (including a shocking slam cut right at the end that's as brilliantly jarring and thematically crucial as anything in the work of Nicolas Roeg).Crucial to the overall aesthetic is how Glass handles perspective; most (although, crucially, not all) of the film is told from Maud's perspective, so we encounter her visions not as an objective third-party would, but as she does. So, when she sees a small whirlpool spontaneously appear in a glass of beer, we see the same thing, and there's no cutaway to show us Maud staring at a normal glass; when a towel placed near a crucifix falls to the ground for no obvious reason, we see it as she does, and there's nothing to objectively suggest why it may have fallen; when God talks to her (in Welsh, no less), we hear His voice as she does, and there's no portion of the scene where we see Maud answering a voice we cannot hear.Along the same lines, what are we to make of the many (many) shots of Maud with windows or lights in the background that create a halo effect? Or of the shot of her walking on the beach, with a thin layer of water covering the sand, which is framed in such a way that it looks like she's walking on water? One particular scene near the end of the film, which I won't go into as it would be a spoiler, is especially important in the construction of a subjective point of view - what we're seeing couldn't possibly be anything other than psychosis, and yet the film has given us very little to confirm such a reading. Could it be that what Maud is experiencing is real? Is this scene confirmation that her mind has irreparably snapped, or is it confirmation that she was completely sane all along? Constructing a scene based on two literally inverse interpretations can't be easy, yet Glass does it so smoothly, you won't even realise the sharp dichotomy until it's all over.Running only 84 minutes, it's extraordinary how much Glass squeezes into her debut feature; from the arresting performances by Clark and Ehle to the thematic complexity to the extraordinarily well-handled perspectival ambiguity to the haunting aesthetic design. Looking at issues such as trauma, faith, fundamentalism, sexuality, and human impermanence, the film has much more going on than the generic horror elements one might expect. Either a depiction of the mental collapse of a young woman or a study of the supernatural, the film is built on ambiguity. One of the best directorial debuts I've seen in a long time, I was only half-way through and I was already looking forward to whatever Glass does next. Saint Maud probably won't break any box-office records, but we are going to be hearing a lot from Rose Glass in the future.",Saint Maud
82,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"Creepy, unsettling atmosphere",8,3 October 2021,"Starts out slow, but wow are you in for a wild ride once Maud starts to unravel. It's not the most conventional scary film. But its themes alongside some great visuals and a wonderfully chilling performance by Morfydd Clark makes this a modern horror in my opinion. It really has a good creepy atmosphere to it. I think if you like a24 films (Hereditary, Midsommar as examples) then you kind of know what you're getting into in sense of the type of horror you're getting into and will like this as well. I can't give it a perfect score though because as stated, it is pretty slow for the first half of the movie. It takes awhile to set things up and get the ball rolling.",Saint Maud
83,TuesdayThe17th,Not what I expected but still a good if not very good drama/horror film,7,1 April 2021,"This is a good, if not very good psychological horror/drama film. I bought the region 2 blu ray release of this movie and like most others my expectations had been very high since this movie was announced a year or two ago. Thankfully though, i was able to lower them before finally watching it last night. I can often visualize a movie quite well before going into it solely based off previews, reviews, and the vibe and tone films boast. However, from the start this film was tough to decipher. The previews were very vague in a similar way that the previews for the film ""The Lodge"" were. Speaking of, this movie has the same vibe as ""The Lodge"" with "" Saint Maud"" ultimately being the weaker film, and is a step or two below ""Hereditary"" and ""Midsommer"" in its production value. Still, this movie falls in the same category and is a nice pick from A24.This movie feels rushed with its super short indie length run time and scenes are cut too quick and i get that is part or the creative choices behind the film but truthfully it hurts this film. The run time should have been at least 95 minutes in my opinion.Also, there isn't much to look at here. There is little to no blood but there is still a large amount of tension that builds through out. This movie is not a masterclass in suspense but it has that flair of atmosphere that other A24 films have. The story is a little bit predictable and overall the story isn't great. The little cgi is also a little bit poorly done and it hurts me to say this but its true. Its kind of mostly a religious drama with touches of pure horror. I still give it a 7 because even though it wasn't what I was expecting it was still right up my alley as i enjoy the slow masterful creepers like this.",Saint Maud

This one is no different. It's a tale of a lonely girl who has found God, but has she really? A study of how loneliness, guilt, grief and religious fanaticism all combine to yield andindividual that is damaged and misguided, and the events that unfold are signs of just how unhinged Maud is becoming.Everything about this film is a winner; from the directors choices to the cast and the script, it all works stunningly well, but again its to be expected. What I didn't expect was to feel goosebumps so clearly when it was all over. Growing up Pentecostal, I've seen what religious fanaticism can do to a person in real life, and it strangely reminiscent of what Maud experienced (minus the....shocking...things, of course).It's a disturbing, difficult film to watch with many layers to peel away.

In general, this is just a very solid film that doesn't feel lacking in any department.Going into this though, it really is much less of a horror than what's suggested. It's a thriller mainly, though that might even be stretching it. It's more so a dramatic character study of a lonely girl who finds her answer and comfort in a religious obsession. It also adds the confusion of what do you believe? Is she just going insane, or is there actually a god or something out there guiding her. Some scenes are clearer in this than others. I chose the former.The story is well done overall, though I found that her transformation was done quicker than I would have liked. I'd rather have had some of the earlier segments cut. Because the first third of the movie is quite slow.The acting, fantastic, no faults to note. No one felt off or out of place or was simply bad.Sounddesign and music...really really good. Some good pair of speakers with bass will enhance your viewing a ton. Besides that it's just so well than and carries the second half of the movie extremely well.

I also loved how it displayed how far people will go for religion and how scary that can be.I really loved the area it was shot it.

Although I liked the descent into madness through mental illness and pious religious punishment, I couldn't see a justifiable reason to link the two and needed more answers for the overly used and hackneyed excuse for craziness. Sometimes people are simply mad, and sometimes people have religious obsessions, but that doesn't equate to being evil, which is the ultimate feeling I had about Maud at the end.Maybe there needed to be a bigger overall picture for me to totally get into bed with the film, but it's a valid effort and might even become a classic in the years to come.

It definitely wasn't that but it was exceptionally atmospheric. It built up such incredible realism and bleakness that I was expecting a pay off that never really came. The subject matter was naturally depressing and the twists and turns of the main character's existence were a dark slog from start to end. It was really well made and the acting from the two leads was top class but overall it was just too relentlessly gloomy without enough more to offer.,Saint Maud

101,ccamp89,"Weak 4 // Well-worn, but comfy nonetheless",8,14 February 2021,"Saint Maud is a debut film that feels like one. It treads familiar psychological horror ground and wears its influences on its sleeve. Carrie, The Witch, Under the Skin, and First Reformed all flash into mind at various moments. Thematically, it has a mildly disappointing bluntness. Its exploration of self-denial, masochism, sexuality, psychosis, and religious delusion is frequently on-the-nose and, at its worst, trite.What it lacks in subtlety, though, it makes up for in its bold visuals, unsettling tone, and infectious first-timer energy. Rose Glass creates a compelling portrait of a woman in extreme conflict with herself, at odds with the very foundation of her being and grasping desperately for a sense of purpose. The juxtaposition of saintly and savage imagery handsomely evokes the internal battle between the superego and id raging inside Maud, brought convincingly to life by the perfectly-cast Morfydd Clark. It's well-worn, but comfy nonetheless.Weak 4/5",Saint Maud

In fact this was more akin to a British drama off BBC one or ITV. People seem to think these days that making a horror movie with religious overtones will convince people it's scaelt because it could be real. Bit these type movies are two a penny now and this director is really not made or cut out for making a horror movie. There were no thrills, suspense or intensity just the same boring plodding story that relies on using a religious background if that makes sense to envoke emotion in people although it fails there too.

111,MK_Ultra_,"Terrific atmospheres, acting and ambiguity",9,5 June 2021,"What a debut. This film isn't a-typical in its approach to both mental illness and fanaticism. You get the viewpoint of someone who is struggling to be acknowledged and finds acceptance in religion. To stop there would be doing this film a disservice---and it's where some apparently tailed off or stopped paying attention. This is the blurred line between the two and what becomes of Maud, as her trauma is prevalent throughout. For the lazy reviews stating nothing about the storyline other than ""predictable"" or ""not horror"", that's truly unfortunate, as religion in itself, especially at her level of fanaticism---is truly frightening. A trope, that for me, if done well, sends chills up my spine almost immediately. Her levels of mental illness are hinted at in several key scenes, but again, in the third act, the layers start to reveal just how far gone she is. You see what isolated and traumatized minds can seek a spiritual remedy, all, while ignoring their own reality, becoming easily led. Her psychosis takes on an even more extreme turn late in the film.Acting, sound editing, and cinematography pull you in, enhancing Mauds eventual decay and into quite an ending that no one sees coming. True horror doesn't have to involve what you know of the genre, it's the portrayal of something truly terrifying...for me worshipping a deity and blind faith is just that.9.5 stars.",Saint Maud

Its a smart, clever movie that takes a while to get going, has a lot of padding and is not in any way a real horror film. It most certainly isnt ""the scariest film of the decade"" or whever that nonsense said. The lead is very good as is almost all the cast - pointless as some of them were. I liked the ending, thoiugh it was a little predictable. As an exploration of religious fervour in the wrong mind and the damage that can do, it certainly succeeds but if you are expecting the exorcist or anything like it, you will be disappointed. This is yet another example of critics trying to show how clever they are and at the same time, causing the movie to disappoint movie goers who, had they ignored those critics would probably have said, yeah, that was pretty good that - which is pretty much all it is.

122,paulmcuomo,...I don't actually know how to title this review.,9,10 October 2020,"This film is certainly something that needs to be experienced in a cinema, and I'm glad it got that rather than the streaming service treatment it very easily could've gotten because the luxuries of pausing, checking your phone etc. would've really gotten you out of the movies many terrifying moments. This is easily one of the most uncomfortable, unsettling movies I've ever seen, and I enjoyed it immensely.To start off with, with have the two main characters of Maud and Amanda, played by Morfydd Clark and Jennfier Elhe respectively. Both of them do a fine job, with us viewing Amanda in the moment rather than as a point-of-view character, and she is portrayed as alternatively pitiable in her dying state, and cruel in her treatment of Maud that makes you view her in ways that intentionally work in the moment, and Elhe conveys this perfectly. Clark, on the other hand, portrays Maud as a gullible, well-intentioned, soft-spoken Welsh girl with a strongly devout Christian faith, but who's always a bad moment away from snapping. Clark is excellent with her physical acting, but especially with her face as in two specific moments she contorts it into shapes that make you unsettled, and carries this all the way through. Just like how Ryan Gosling broke out in The Believer, this is Morfydd Clark's breakout. There are other actors in bit roles who all convey characters that give a great insight into Maud and Amanda's lives, but those two are the main highlight of the movie acting wise.The real MVP of the movie is the Lighting and Sound work. Rose Glass, in her directorial and writing debut does a lot of effective work with minimalism and what isn't there than what was. In terms of scares, a lot of it is through theme and mis-en-scene and not so much jump scares - in that, there's one jump scare sequence at the films end and that's it. The film has a lot of close-ups and extreme close-ups to create tension, and in the dark seeing flashes of Maud's eyes piercing through with blue, or the pervasive clock ticking overshadowing a simple scene really emphasise this. However, there are a few instances where the film tries a more experimental approach, and whilst I understand what she's trying, it didn't work for me; namely, when Maud gets fired by Amanda, she starts to spiral out of control and the film portrays this by slipping the camera upside-down, when a Dutch angle would've worked just as well and not been as distracting.Overall, the religious horror film is one that's easy to make but hard to make well without sounding biased or exploitative, or worse just crass. This film avoids both, by making Maud kind but easily led, right but sometimes doing wrong things, and making the horror elements more inferred than overt. You can tell the clear influences of Roman Polanski in this, whilst also making it Rose Glass to the core.If you haven't yet seen this movie, SEE IT NOW WHILE YOU STILL CAN. It won't be the same on DVD or Stream, and there's not much else out so you might as well.",Saint Maud

The subject matter is something that can be easily based in reality, and that makes it all the more horrific. The visuals are beautiful. The acting is good. Morfydd Clark (Maud) was amazing at playing the creepy quiet type. The volume drove me a little bit crazy.

131,willcrabbe,A deeply unsettling psychological horror from debutant Rose Glass,9,15 June 2021,"A fantastic directorial debut from Rose Glass, Saint Maud is a deeply atmospheric and psychological horror that will get deep under your skin in a way similar to other contemporaries such as Jonathan Glazer's Under the Skin and Robert Egger's The VVitch. The horror doesn't come from an excess of jump scares or spooky ghosts and monsters, but from a real and tangible sense of dread and discomfort generated by the deeply unsettling atmosphere and wonderfully isolated and detached performance from the lead Morfydd Clark (at times reminiscent of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver).The film follows hospice nurse Maud (portrayed by the aforementioned Morfydd Clark), a recent convert to Roman Catholicism, who becomes obsessed with a former dancer in her care (Jennifer Ehle), believing she is obliged by God to save her soul.We enter the world and mindspace of Maud as we question whether she is really a vessel of the divine, or if she is going mad. At times we ponder whether there is a clear distinction between the two. The score from Adam Janota Bzowski and sound design from Paul Davies work excellently to drag us deeper into the psyche of this troubled soul.I always love to see successful independent British films, and Saint Maud is certainly another one to add to the pantheon.

This is a brilliant, brilliant psychological thriller in the vein of Black Swan, not Jacob's ladder. The latter (no pun intended) was also a horror movie, this one is not. It is an exploration, in a sense, of the way religion can distort a lonely and fragile mind into madness, but it happens in a carefully paced manner, it slowly burns its way into your mind, rather than attacks your senses, as you would expect a great horror film to do. I wish I would have gone into this movie with the right expectations, and I'm left feeling a bit cheated out of an even greater experience.

I've read some of the other reviews, and it's clear this will be a polarizing movie. As many others have said, marketing this as a horror is very, very wrong. That must set up expectations that aren't fulfilled, thus inviting bad reviews. This is a very intense personal journey into madness (or sainthood), and as such shouldn't really even be in the realm of entertainment, let alone labeled horror for a cheap thrill. The film kept me watching because the acting is superb, and I actually wanted to have some sort of resolution, but I wasn't enjoying it, if that makes sense. Some parts of it I really loathed: seedy sex scenes for example. What is with the lesbian content in every single film these days? Is it not enough to have an only-female cast in almost all films without making them all have sex with each other too?The ending of the film is possibly the best part. Don't blink or you'll miss it.So, overall, I'm mystified as to how to rate. Ultimately, however clever its aim is, I think it misses by making the movie so depressing and downbeat that we can't come away from it believing that we've watched a saint being made.

It is written and directed by Rose Glass (english author of the award-winning Room 55 short), in her feature film debut.The plot focuses on an extremely religious hospice nurse (Kate - who refers to herself as Maud), and starts working for Amanda, a terminal cancer patient, a famous ex-dancer and choreographer, atheistic and hedonistic, in a seaside mansion in England. During the routine, we soon realize that the religious aspect of the protagonist is very weird. It seems to be an approach of the nurse with the patient in the spiritual sense (which to me seemed to be partially ironic from Amanda, who even calls her a ""savior""), but in the end the situation that this generates just intensifies the conflict between the two ways of life.The film revolves around these characteristics, emphasizing Maud's unhealthy relationship with religion, with the background of her personality and past (a piece shown briefly in the beginning), which seeks salvation and acceptance through it. But it ends up following the tortuous paths of fanaticism, guilt and scourge, with scenes of distorted religiosity, mixed with delusions and sin (which are attempts at acceptance), amid the mental illness that fanaticism becomes - or intensifies, with the trigger of it all this being the ""divine mission"".From that point onward, the spiral of hallucination and perdition intensifies, until the very end, which in my view isn't so surprising, although it is still relatively impactful. The pace of the film is slower at first, but begins to take shape and more rhythm with the unfolding of the plot.
In the lead role, Morfydd Clark (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, The Personal History of David Copperfield) as Kate / Maud and Jennifer Ehle as Amanda (Zero Dark Thirty, A Quiet Passion). Morfydd's acting is excellent, natural and it is really one of the highlights of the film that is based more than 90% on the psychology of the character.Ben Fordesman's cinematography, also debuting in a feature film (he made before some short films and the series The End of the F *** ing World), is very good, dark and melancholic, with the use of a yellowish filter and with concise close-ups framing the expressions and environments. The location of the movie in an old seaside city, almost timeless, also emphasizes the melancholy (Scarborough, in North Yorkshire on the east coast of England). The music is by Adam Janota Bzowski (another newcomer to feature films), and emphasizes the unrestrained rhythm that madness takes, with the use of many bass and persistent instruments.The film is a very good psychological thriller with a pinch of horror, in line with other films in the alternative A24 niche (such as The Witch, The Lighthouse, Midsommar). Perhaps not as impactful as the others, but very good nonetheless, with strong performances and a story with an interesting theme and unfolding, which mainly addresses a vulnerable person who uses religion as an instrument to acceptance, but in the process, ends up losing herself even more. I would rate it 7.5 / 10.0.",Saint Maud

147,maxwellsnake24,Horror with brains and soul,9,8 February 2021,"Like the Aussie chiller 'relic' released the same year, rose glass's feature length debut 'saint maud' is unafraid to venture where most mainstream horror dares not go and that's into the very depths of human fraility. It should come as no surprise then that both movies have female directors and both eschew the masculine view of violence and torment as entertainment. Like 'relic' , 'saint maud' also has a three dimensional female protagonist. Maud is a timid,waif like private nurse who cares for terminally ill patients and has strong religious convictions. The latest patient assigned to her is an ex American dancer named amanda, seemingly chalk and cheese in their worldviews, how will these two interact with each other ? I won't divulge anymore as I don't want to enter spoiler territory, what I will say however is that 'saint maud' is an ultra impressive piece of film making and one of the most rewarding viewing experiences i have had in a.while. From the great acting performances, in particular morfydd clark as maud to the deeply profound and thought provoking script, this movie is a million miles away from the T and A saturated gorefests or bland found footage abominations that the genre is known for nowadays.

It's very anti-religion, and will probably be a lot more disturbing to some people in that regard, while others not at all.
The climax of the movie happens so quickly and ends abruptly. We're still left wanting answers to certain questions - especially regarding her past - but left with completely empty hands.
But yes, it's interesting. Not for people expecting supernatural/violent/gore or any of that. It is indeed more psychological thriller (mostly not even a thriller) than a horror. And it's definitely not for people who dislike slow burns.

Also, this movie can be taken as a statement against religious fundamentalism.

It had been a long time since I'd gone to see a good horror film during its theatrical release cycle, and so I was really looking forward to seeing this one at the cinema. But then covid happened and the release was pushed back from April to October, further delaying my gratification. Yet now that I've finally seen it, I can't believe I was ever hyped for it to come out. Make no mistake: I love slow-burn horror movies, but only when they're executed correctly. In this case, I felt that the tension kind of fizzled out half-way through and the third-act payoff just wasn't there. It's less of a horror movie and more of a psychological character study with very brief moments of unsettling imagery. To put it bluntly, the main character just isn't interesting or dynamic enough for this to work. Her internal monologues were much more tedious than they were creepy. The ending felt phoned-in and cliché; I even heard a couple of snide chuckles when the credits rolled. But I think the biggest issue for me was that the marketing felt deceptive... I didn't really get anything resembling what the trailers alluded to... nearly all of the ""action"" was shown in the trailers, with the other 90% of the film being a chore to sit through. Now that I think of it, this mismanagement of audience expectations is quite reminiscent of the way I felt about another A24 dud, ""It Comes At Night"".

I will read an good review about a movie with an interesting premise and then waste my time to watch it. And many times, it ended up to be a movie distributed/produced by A24. Quite an coincident.Just like I was with Hereditary and Midsommer, I had high hope with this one and then see my hope dashed and myself bored to tears. I am beginning to suspect that the production company just hired people to write good review online.This film is about a nurse who is bonkers and getting more so for some very vague and unconvincing reason. The acting from various actors are either melodramatic or drab. There are plenty of good slow burn films but this one is just rubbish. There are also many good films with unlikable characters who somehow strike a cord with the audience and there is not a single one in this film.Thank A24 for another stinking dog pile and for wasting one perfectly good evening.",Saint Maud
203,manumanumanu-41512,So boring....,4,3 October 2021,"Visually stunning.Great actor.A slow descent into a mad mind on the theme of religion.But it s so boring, story is going nowhere.Not a horror movie, not a thriller movie, not a suspens movie...not a movie in fact lol.Boring and boring and boring.How can this have such high rating ?..this is the most stunning part of this movie.....",Saint Maud
204,ncere,Once again critics praise another A24 movie,5,6 February 2021,"I've been waiting to watch this movie for 2 years now, especially when it started going around festivals and gained stellar reviews everywhere it was presented.Having finally watched the movie, I really can't understand what here is so unbelievable, scary, smart, etc. How many movies did we watch where we have main character suffering from fragile psyche due to some past trauma and since we are watching everything from their perspective, we're not sure whats real and whats not.
Cinematography, acting and few scenes are all done great, but that's about it. We've seen this all so many times and to say and hail this like one of the best horror movies is complete and utter nonsense ( to put it mildly ). Between 5 and 6 stars of 10 available.",Saint Maud
205,iTizzano,And I'm glad you're angry,10,18 May 2021,"Saint Maud had its world premiere at tiff back in September of 2019. Met with acclaim both critically, and publicly. It was then picked up for distribution by A24. With the A24 name attached, it was quick to garner attention. Stuck in a perpetual hype loop, it's initial Fall 2019 release was delayed - a literal year and a half. Now officially released in the states, it has been quick to receive criticism for unrealistic expectations getting left unmet.Saint Mauds artistic, elevated labels are as condign as they are trite. Genre filmmaking has taken a dramatic turn. Now accessible to the ironic crowd's, ironic viewing, now unironic... ironically. What a cataclysmic turn that has transpired, indelible, memorable, quotidian.Everything is flawless, start to finish. As with any good writing, it paints a picture outside of frame. It outlines themes between themes, with an overall artistic aesthetic. Climactic payoff, may not be top-tier, more high-mid. However, it does resonate. Everything is exactly as it should be.. The best genre release of the year.",Saint Maud
206,metecanduren,Fantastic.,10,23 April 2020,Fantastic movie that has a decent pace and great eerie sequences. It is a very religious movie and it stands as one of the best of the decade thus far.,Saint Maud
207,rsquires,"Welcome to Planet Earth, Maud",6,27 February 2021,"Every tired characteristic of a religious fanatic was bundled into one in this movie: Death-obsessed mousy wallflower, check; epileptic seizures taken for religious ecstasy, check; schizophrenic hearing of voices, check; bug crawling on the wall, check. The film-making showed me nothing of interest either. Tawdry and depressing? Yes, well, welcome to Planet Earth, Maud!",Saint Maud
208,aya-baclao,A worthy representative of modern horror.,7,14 August 2021,Full of horror tropes but surprisingly not at all dumb and predictable. No jump scares but is rather subtle and psychological. Saint Maud deserves to be a modern cult classic.,Saint Maud
209,dsfbeaujean-22817,Horror??? Freaks show maybe,5,6 February 2021,"So disappointing, the only positive thing I would say is at least the actors aren't too bad but honestly the story???!! Really not worth your time trust me, total waste",Saint Maud
210,ShropshireLass123,Not too convinced,4,5 February 2021,"To be honest I thought there was strange casting involved. Maud simply didn't come across as a nurse, her voice is difficult to make out, and sounds too prissy & educated. Ehle is okay but doesn't have the depth of character of an artist. The friend comes out quite well by comparison. I didn't really consider this to be a horror film, more a portrayal of a mentally ill woman with some atmospheric bits & pieces around her to imply something horrifically supernatural was going to happen, but it never did. After all murder & suicide are extreme expressions of psychosis.... so I'm thinking it's more psychosis than horror . The ending wasn't too convincing either.",Saint Maud
211,tweezygum-98276,No thrills nor chills found here. Sort of.,3,4 March 2021,"Considering the high rating this film has received, I expected the next great horror movie. That wasn't the case unfortunately. Saint Maud thrives on great acting but falls flat with the rest. Not much happens in this film and its basically only the ending that packs a punch. Its definitely a thought provoking film which I kind of liked as well, but it didn't offer enough thrills to really grab my attentionBasically it's a boring film.The plot follows Maud, a reclusive (and highly religious) nurse that is tasked with caring for a patient dying from cancer. Maud becomes obsessed with the idea that she needs to save her patient's soul before it's too late, but madness soon consumes her in her soul saving mission.If you are someone who enjoys more psychological horror with minimal scares/creepy moments I would probably recommend this. But otherwise, it didn't do much for me at all.",Saint Maud
212,davejam-49821,waste of time.,1,2 February 2021,A confusing and pointless movie. the acting is fine. but i wasted an hour and a half of my time on this rubbish.,Saint Maud
213,Belldogg81,Definitely scarier than Harold & Maud,7,8 March 2021,Been hearing good things about this film for a while. Not a huge horror fan but try and watch the well received ones. This is slightly mis-described being much more a psychological drama with horror elements.Amazing central performances from Morfydd Clark and Jennifer Ehle. First thing I've seen from from the writer/director too but I'm sure this must be her finest work to date. Deeply unsettling throughout with some genuinely upsetting scenes. The film makes the most of the central character's religious fervour coupled with her diminishing mental health. This is the engine that drives the film. Although seemingly slow paced it's really clear this is intentional as the tension mounts to the terrifying climax. It reminded me of Under the Skin and to a lesser extent a film Called Calvaire in its almost kitchen sink drama approach to the scares.Nothing showy or glossy which keeps everything grounded and believable. No real gimmicky jump scares or other silly horror tropes which usually put me off. A great little film which deserves a much bigger audience.,Saint Maud
214,aharris69,Slow burner?,4,2 February 2021,"An earlier review said ""slow burner"". I wish they'd set fire to the cameras then I wouldn't have wasted 11/2 hrs of my life. I just don't know what it's trying to be. It's not horror nor thriller nor mystery. Please can film maker's just go back to basics? Stop trying to come up with weird endings, my brain can't take any more.",Saint Maud
215,dataxlore,A really boring non-horror movie,2,31 July 2021,"This was on cable the other night and after reading the description, I was looking forward to watching it.There is nothing scary about this movie. It's not absolutely horrible or the worst thing I've seen. But it's boring, just plain boring. I kept waiting for something to happen or the story to get better or...something.Again it's not the worst thing I've seen, but it's not worth making an effort to watch.",Saint Maud
216,rohan0404,another gem from a24,7,30 August 2021,"I really don't know what should i say about this movie. But here i go : this is a beautifully shot and edited movie. The performances are amazing. This movie had me hooked from the very first shot. Fanatic religiousness, obsession, trauma are not a great mix in one's life trust me. The cinematography is noteworthy as I've mentioned earlier but this movie also has a really horrifying score. Some of the scenes were synced with the score and that was perfect.",Saint Maud
217,julioramosest,A mixed bag,6,23 December 2020,"It's great to see movies made by women with real women in there, far from masculine movie-making stereotypes. Kudos on that. The rest... Meh. it's sold as modern horror and it's not and the big numbers drama just fails for me. I've thought about big numbers. Nothing new or groundbreaking here. And I also find this movie so religion-centered, even if it's for criticize it, that it annoys me just as a Christian-propaganda movie would.",Saint Maud

Astounding.",9,9 February 2021,"If you're expecting jump scares, gore or any other typical horror tropes (re the tired exorcism/possession -yawn) , you won't find them here.What you will find, is a creeping, claustrophobic character study that doesn't let up. Isolation, desperation, shame, punishment...Perverted, twisted and deeply sad. An astounding movie, written and directed by Rose Glass, and beautifully acted by Morfydd Clark.",Saint Maud
219,thelinnets,The most boring British horror you'll ever see,2,20 March 2021,"Not really a horror, more a miserable drama with snail pacing and very little to get excited about. I really can't understand the fuss about this movie as it is literally so boring I couldn't wait for it to be over. I've given it a 2 because the acting is good and one scene was decent and unpredictable but that's it. Save your precious time.",Saint Maud

221,mike_film09,Not nearly as good as everyone says,4,21 February 2021,"At the time of writing, every headline about this movie is filled with superlatives. Well, I don't want to diss a rare well-made British movie but actually, it's quite bad and I'll bet that you're disappointed with it.
Why? Without spoilers, it's fair to say this an anti-hero movie, where we are watching the central character do things that are increasingly awful. Normally anti-hero movies, from The Joker back to (part of) Silence of the Lambs, at least make their anti-heroes interesting. But the central character here is profoundly UNinteresting: stupid, deluded and socially inept. So there's that.
Then there's the fact that the central relationship between nurse and patient is poorly dramatised. Most of the character-related material comes from others who pop up coincidentally (eg while the anti-heroine is walking on the seafront). So the movie's key relationship never really works dramatically.The key to the movie's current success, I think, is that the movie is heavily pretentious, and critics love that. They can fashion whole reviews on the gap between story and meaning. But I don't think mainstream audiences are in the same place at all. And you might find this yourself if you're unwise enough to pay money to see it. So, despite being in a minority of one (so far) I'm just saying be warned.
P.S. If you want a horror movie about a carer, try 'Livide': it's got more genuine creepiness in its little finger than exists in all of 'Saint Maud'.",Saint Maud

223,info-650-994633,"Uncomfortable, but totally worth the struggle!",9,29 March 2021,"It's great to watch a film that finally breaks the mold of the conventional, and frankly very boring standard horror movies we've been subjected to the past decade(s). They all seem to follow the same path: A house (or a doll, or whetever object) - an evil spirit - a family with kids - a few squeaking doors opening by themselves at night - a struggle - an open-ended victory.Saint Maud however, solely focusses on the psyche of one person and makes you wonder if what you see is real, or just the figment of the protagonist's madness. At times it's very disturbing, confusing and rather uncomfortable viewing. It's definately not a date movie like ""Annabelle"": It takes the viewer over the edge a few times, but when you can find the least bit of guts to go through with it, you simply have to admid Saint Maud is totally original and might be the best horror movie you've seen in the past 15 years: It's hair-raisingly creepy, it's lead actress is totally brilliant and the punchline totally haunts you!",Saint Maud

Worth it.",Saint Maud
225,JamShake-101,Ned Flanders Disapproves,8,28 June 2021,"Where were the Oscar nominations for this taut, nuanced and superbly unnerving horror? With two BAFTA nominations (Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer), there is so much to admire about Rose Glass' feature debut. What struck me especially during the initial moments were the deliciously subtle uses of editing and lighting to accentuate the already unsettling atmosphere introduced through Saint Maud's off-key but strangely real characters.The positives extend beyond the initial promise however, as Glass confidently weaves multiple themes - trauma, death, sexual identity, religion - into a darkly sensual web of terror. Morfydd Clark is just the most perfect piece of casting here, her slight frame, quietly raw voice and pale, expressive features really lending themselves to the manifestation of a fractured, desperate soul. Often I found myself recalling moments from Jonathan Glazer's 'Under the Skin', and in certain scenes in particular you really feel a similar sense of piercing, intensely physical and spiritual isolation.Given their equally striking imaginative displays and overlapping themes, it's no wonder that William Blake and his work are interwoven into and echoed throughout Glass' film. I must say that the manner in which Blake was dropped in was ironically flat, but much like in 'Red Dragon', his idiosyncratic imagery adds a provocative visual layer to the film, whilst Maud's hyperphantasia is given a further sense of context and meaning through reference to his work and spiritual outlook. Much as Maud herself cuts out and incorporates Blake's art as part of her shrine, so too do you feel that Glass is pointedly extracting and absorbing elements both as a form of reverence and also as a way of enriching the film's overall meaning.N. B - Never looking at boiling soup in the same way again.",Saint Maud

It will be kind of boring for psychologists and clinical professionals, though (like a plumber watching the movie about kitchen sink failure), since they watch it every day. The lead actress made a good job, and she convincingly depicted the type of schizophrenia the movie is whole about. Even shes physical appearance closely matches the disease. There are parts of the plot in the movie that are left unexplained without a reason. The end is good, but it could be better and it is nothing like David Fincher's ""Seven"" or ""Piaget's Last Fear"" (book) - two masterpieces with endings that you see/read once in a lifetime.

I guess you wont be satisfied with this if you're expecting a thrilling, slashing and traditional horror movie. Because it's not one of those.However - if you like movies such as Black Swan, Hereditary, Midsommar etc - you will love this one as well.

234,timurtaimur,Horror? Yet not?,5,14 February 2021,"I was very excited to watch this movie. But while I understand the references and the obvious religious interpretations many may take from this movie it both strikes at the heart of filming but rides it through an extremely weak storyline.The compositions, shadowing, acting were all spot on for the most part. But if you're expecting horror, I'd say to expect more of a psychological thriller that uses horror as a metaphor.Clearly the main character has mental health issues but that shouldn't constitute the movie genre as being horror specific. PTSD? If so, it doesn't offer an exciting conclusion for those of us that suffer with it.Though the movie offers just enough for us to understand her background, aside from that I feel there is much left out.It's a great movie, and horror films are of course difficult to make, but this misses the mark to be classified as such. Most horror movies are built for jump scares, this goes for the psychological jugular but doesn't understand it.However, if this were a movie depicting mental health and delusions I would say it is a masterpiece.",Saint Maud

Electric, razor sharp direction from Glass.

257,hottentot7,Saint Who?,5,1 February 2021,"Can't decide if it's a Polanski movie or a Gaspar Noë movie, swims in the uncomfortable waters in between and finally drowns. The only thing that momentarily keeps it from drowning is the spirited performance by Morfyd Clark.
Over-directed with tilting camera shots and ominous music masking the lack of substance. The ending rings hollow. For this kind of material done better see Paul Schrader's First Reformed or even Taxi Driver",Saint Maud

The movie is such a deep exploration into loneliness, and how we choose to cope. Yes the movie was undoubtedly terrifying and horrific, but it's immensely sad too. This is honestly one of the best debuts I've ever seen, it's one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, heck it's one of the best films I've ever seen.",Saint Maud
260,maysa-63258,What a stylish cry!,8,21 August 2020,"With the proliferation of online streaming service companies, the film industry had changed considerably in the last five years. There as some pros and cons, about which I am not going to write in detail, but there's at least one undeniable fact: sales and producers are looking for creative content. Free-to-air television channels, such as Film4, had to invest in the search for new talents, and specifically for female voices. It's under those circumstances that a voice such as Rose Glass was heard. I must confess, what a stylish cry!As a movie produced for British TV, thriller is certainly not a risky bet. It is a popular genre among the British, as you can verify on this list released by the BFI. But Saint Maud is definitely not a common thriller. The film is set in Coney Island, UK, that despite being a seaside town, it is soaked up in loneliness. Its mostly empty beach is the perfect scenario to Katie, or Saint Maud, a nurse that has recently converted into Christianism. She's about to start a new job, as a carer in Amanda's house. Amanda, 49, is a former choreographer who is now spending her days begging for company in her wheelchair.Maud and Amanda's clash is not only based on class and upbringing differences, Maud representing the essence of spiritual life, and Amanda's a preacher of hedonism. Most of all it puts into check mental issues. It is clear from the beginning that Maud is a tormented soul, and Amanda has long ago left the phase ""mens sana in corpore sano"".Both characters have suffered traumas. Amanda's pain is visible and clinical, it's certainly difficult to cope with her new reality as her own life was devoted to movement. Something must have happened to Maud. It becomes clear when she meets a former co-worker who is surprised she's still working as a nurse.Gradually, Maud's mind is revealed. It's dark. A whole set of artifices comes to life to build up this darkness: from insects to William Blake's paintings. We become aware that God is the second main character. Saint Maud speaks directly to narratives such as Paul Schrader's First Reformed -- read our review here. Likewise Ethan Hawke's character, Maud has to encourage someone else to face his demons when herself is failing to face her own.In her debut film, Rose Glass has already formed her own solid style, with tints of gothic psychological drama. Saint Maud is part of the London Film Festival, that is currently on. If you miss it, check Film4 future program.Follow me at Amayzing Movies.",Saint Maud

I was unsure of where it was really going for a long time, which will probably improve upon second viewing. The performances were excellent, an astounding directional debut from Rose Glass who is sure to be a talent to look out for. Cinematography was immaculate, sound design and score was chilling and very suspenseful. As already mentioned, the ending unsettled me to my core, and the final image is now seared into my memory.

It would have been useful to learn more about Maud, what happened in the hospital, how she came to be what we see on the screen - basically, we needed to know her backstory. We didn't get any of this, so for me it was just watching a troubled young woman doing strange things that seem schizophrenia related but I had no empathy for her. There was a huge anti-climax, despite the dramatic ending and it was so disappointing.When we left the cinema, I almost had nothing to discuss. So I thought okay, maybe it's one of those films where I need to let it marinate and then analyse. But three days later, I still have very little to say about this film.",Saint Maud

That is a real scare!",Saint Maud

277,Andrewhails,Boring,3,9 October 2020,"This really isn't the film it's being portrayed to be, certainly not a horror of any description. It's premise merely focuses on the deteriorating mental health of a nurse and her influence by god and religion. Well acted with one unexpected jump towards the end but largely a boring ride of a movie. This movie would never of got a main stream release were it not for the lack of movies available to cinemas, better Fayre on Netflix",Saint Maud
278,FilmWook,DEVOTION AND OBSESSION,7,16 February 2021,"One of the beautiful things about religion is faith. It provides a meaningful and spiritual spark invoking hope and belief. A belief that following a certain guideline in accordance to the doctrines of a certain religion can provide someone with clarification and a somewhat clairvoyant way of making sense of world and purpose. It can be a very powerful thing and as in any religion, we see different levels of interpretation and devotion. In Rose Glass' feature debut Saint Maud we witness this firsthand as a young hospice nurse named Maud, once known as Katie, grapples with either a supernatural entity or a mental breakdown. Glass has purposely left the ending to be ambiguous, leaving it up to the viewer to interpret the film in their own way and decide what is happening to Maud. My personal opinion is that her mental health is deteriorating and her devotion to her religion is fueling the psychosis, like shoveling coal into a firebox and unfortunately, which I believe to be Maud's case, sometimes devotion and obsession can fall on two sides of the same coin. We have seen religion used time and time again as a rationalization for people to do some deranged things. Sometimes that rationalization can be used as a justification for committing despicable acts, fully believing or not, that what they are doing is in the name of God or a higher power. While we can't be fully sure whether Maud is suffering a psychotic breakdown or a spiritual being has truly taken possession, Saint Maud successfully tiptoes the line between the two in eye opening, jaw dropping fashion.",Saint Maud

281,mathewhaine,An incredible character study,9,22 February 2021,"Don't go into this expecting jump scares, twists and genre cliches as it appears some others here may have done, and been disappointed.There are genuine scares but it's more of a tragic, dreadful character study than a typical horror. If you like films like The Witch and The Lighthouse you will find plenty to like here.Saint Maud is about how loneliness and isolation can disconnect us from reality (think Taxi Driver). The horror comes from the tragedy of Maud's perception becoming increasingly distant from that of the other characters. The way the film shifts between perspectives is captivating, and even daring, and just so well done in the sound design, effects and cinematography. Mental health and religion are what accelerate Maud's decline but that's not ""all the film is about"".On a purely technical level this film is so well made it defies its rating on that basis alone. Add to that the richness and complexity of the character study and you have one of the best horror films in years.",Saint Maud
282,maxswami,Think 'taxi driver' but with a nurse,6,9 March 2021,"Beautiful cinematography, and a very possible series of events. The direction, imagery and soundtrack/musical compositions combined give you a standing on pins and needles feeling, on edge and forever waiting for some sort of climax. Although the climax doesn't hit quite as hard as 'taxi driver'. I love stories where the way it's told ends up being better than the content of the story itself. It's like how life is, you experience moments that you think are bonified legendary but when you go to tell tge tale to someone else, you realize it wasn't quite as epic as if you were there. This movie does that justice in potraying a very possible situation.",Saint Maud

I don't even mind slow paced plots, but this was too much, even for me... You are being kept waiting for the big bang all the time, only to discover that there is none. Even though I enjoyed acting and the attempt to build up something like a storyline, this movie lacks in many things, mainly finesse and good writing.

284,CatWhisperer_sh1,Slow burn to...no burn (no pun intended),1,9 April 2021,"I was expecting a thriller/horror movie as it is classified as such, it is definitely neither of those. If this had been listed as a psychological drama it I would have given and extra star or two based solely on the fact that it does attempt to cover the very important issue of mental health illness; but it did a very poor job even at trying to represent that. I am all for bringing awareness to mental health issues as I have close relatives that suffer from a variety of illnesses; however, any mental illness is so much more complex than they made it out to be.Warning, I am going to go on a bit of a rant as it is an issue that hits very close to home.You get absolutely no back story on Maude, only a few glimpses and some very vague references to the very recent incident that led to her ending up in private nursing and working for Amanda. To even attempt to understand the most basic facts about mental illness you need to know so much more of the personal history to just hope to grasp the tiniest inkling of what mental illness does and the way it affects a persons entire life. This movie did show how it can overtake a person's life completely, but with no history or back story, Maud just came off as total religious fanatic which in itself is not a mental illness. It can definitely be part of mental illness, but you only know the difference if you have the history and facts.I will stop my rant here will the final statement that I obviously do not recommend this movie as a thriller, horror, psychological drama or any other genre it claims to fit in. It was poorly written, poorly executed; just poorly done in every way.",Saint Maud

In lesser hands Maud could have been portrayed as a villain, but here she's depicted with gentleness and sympathy.

You can't look away, you can't shut it off, it is there right in front of you. The thing about this film which stood out to me the most, was that it was horribly relatable and oh so human. While Maud is at the extream end of things, I found her so understandable and this is what made the film so hard to watch. It's her incredible loneliness that everyone feels but emphasised in the form of cinema and it really gets to you. The direction from Rose Glass was just outstanding for her debut film, the amount of atmosphere running throughout the film was incredible. She held the power to be able to make me apprehensive and frightened over something, so simple like an extreme close up of soup. Morfydd Clark perfectly portrayed Maud as this wandering character searching for someone to project her loneliness onto, she truly understood the character. There were one or two flaws in the film but nothing major that could be noticed.

325,liam_colley,Never waste your pain,8,10 June 2021,"As an A24 fan, I was really excited about this film and whilst this wasn't the horror film I thought it was going to be, it really didn't disappoint. I do acknowledge, however, this may not be for everyone.This film was shot beautifully and I loved the town in which it was set. It created a really dreary, creepy atmosphere which was heightened by the amazing soundtrack. The acting all round was top notch and you could really feel the emotions from the actors, especially the lead, Morfydd Clark. I also think you'd be hard pressed to find a better directorial debut (Rose Glass), except maybe Ari Aster's Hereditary (I know... A24 fanboy).I think this film can be interpreted in a number of ways, but I enjoyed 'why' Maud sought out religion to deal with past trauma as a coping mechanism. Whilst the film does a good job at keeping things very ambiguous which I like, including whether Maud is indeed mentally ill, there are enough clues throughout that give you a sense of Mauds motivations. Within the initial scene and flashback scene, it seems that Maud has accidentally killed a previous patient of hers. This is backed up by the two encounters Maud has with Joy, which gives a sense that something bad happened in her previous job which was Maud's fault prior to quitting and becoming a private carer. Maud could have potentially caused her patient to die due to a lapse in care if she were late for a shift/too hungover to carry out her duties properly, as there were clues that before Maud found religion she regularly went out to bars etc... The trauma of this and her actions causing the incident was then the catalyst to Maud breaking down and finding religion, motivating her to save Amanda's soul, potentially to save her own and seek redemption for her causing a patients death and not being able to save them. Maud can't accept people questioning her faith as she feels this is the only thing that can save her own soul. As it becomes evident that Maud cannot save Amanda's soul, she views Amanda as a demon as she cannot deal with her failure and in turn failing to seek redemption for her past actions. I could of course be barking up the wrong tree, but this film really did make me think.Whilst, this is a slow burn, I do think my only criticism would be at times you did feel the fact it was a slow burn, however the pay offs were so worth it. I really cannot wait to see what Rose Glass does next!",Saint Maud
326,Henry-96594,So boring,2,19 July 2021,"Normally a thriller do not bore me, I am not very picky or easily bored by movies. This movie must be one of the few I have seen, with close to zero action or scary scenes. Why did anyone give this movie a 9/10? Beats me...",Saint Maud
327,kellyannedwards-59198,Not great but not terrible either,7,7 August 2021,86 mins of watchable psychological horror watching an obvious disturbed young woman slip further. Not the greatest films and not one you would watch more than once but definitely watchable.,Saint Maud
328,sxqhtdqht,Saint nothing happens in the entire movie,1,11 August 2021,"This movie was a waste of time. Literally nothing happens. After half an hour i read the other reviews claiming that it would pick up, but sadly it did not.",Saint Maud
329,graemejoy-60087,Underrated Gem,9,15 September 2021,I hesitated to watch this movie for six months and when I finally sat down to watch it I was blown away. Don't watch any trailers. Just go into it blind and enjoy the experience. Solid performances all round especially from the lead actress. It's a haunting masterpiece that will stay with you long after the credits roll.,Saint Maud
330,daves-94448,Had high hopes for this 1 after reading all the reviews BUT what a big disappointment,1,17 October 2021,Starts off boring and continued to be so 30-40 min into the movie. Turned it off. Not sure why it's so highly rated for a horror. I'm not sure what people consider a good horror movie nowadays but this definitely ain't it.,Saint Maud
331,tiggy1500,NOT A HORROR MOVIE,5,18 October 2020,"When I say this was so boring I almost fell asleep you'll know to not see this if you want to be scared. And that's saying something given that I can't watch horror movies because they make me too scared. Walking past an alleyway on the way home was more scary. Have the critics lost all sense since pandemic lockdowns? It's not really even a thriller. It's just a girl going mad in a completely linear plot. No twists, no turns, and a completely predictable ending that you knew would happen since the beginning. I only didn't rank it lower because it's quite pretty and we'll acted.",Saint Maud

334,piergianni91,It's not an horror movie and it's really boring,1,16 October 2020,Don't waste your money. I was expecting a scary horror movie but the best part of the movie is the trailer.The story is empty and it's really slow. I don't understand how is it possible that they released it on the big screen. Such a waste of time,Saint Maud

336,masai79,Criminal marketing!,7,4 February 2021,"The elements of thrill and horror are negligible in this movie.
Does that mean it isn't good? Not quite, rather that the marketing campaign went terribly wrong and people are left feeling being mis-sold. I don't blame them.
All in all a better than average psychological drama that will leave undisturbed the most.
Word of advice for hardcore horror fans: cancel any expectation you might have of getting scared watching this because chances are you won't.",Saint Maud

Beautifully shot, great build up of tension leading to a terrifying climax - fantastic & mesmerising performances from both female leads. You'll want to watch it again as so many nuances and nods to previous work. It leaves you with more questions than answers abs will stay with you for days. Don't miss it.",Saint Maud
339,mertagacik,Such a waste of time!!!,1,30 May 2021,"I can call myself a horror/thriller movie enthusiast. However, thls movie was neither horror nor thriller. It has only one scary scene. It was extremely dull and boring. Although it can be perceived as a slow-paced movie by certain people, I think that it was just boring.

346,mark_masiak,Dull beyond belief,1,6 October 2020,"The nurse has supposed to have suffered a traumatic experience in a hospital which you don't see and isn't explained except for a bit of wishy-washy dialogue in the middle. The nurse than is portrayed as becoming a religious fanatic but the script is so scared of offending it misses a fantastic opportunity for her to become a serious pious fanatic with schizophrenic visions. She has one or two throughout the whole movie. The film is 1hr 24 minutes long, but you can skip to 1hr 22m when something actually happens. The script really let this movie down and could have been really good with much more schizophrenic visions and religious fear. Morfydd Clark acting was superb though which scrapes this movie as a 1/10",Saint Maud

Tired of wasting my time with these artsy fartsy garbage movies! There is litterally ONE scene in this movie that got me, and that was only cause it cought me off guard as i was numb with boredom. I give it 4 stars as the ending was quite good, but the rest of the movie was just boring and eventless..
Cant wait for this era of horro to be over, and hopefully we see a resurgence of evil dead type of horror! It is due time now",Saint Maud
