0,TheLittleSongbird,Has the spectacle but not the brains or heart,5,26 July 2017,"First thing off the bat, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' were thoroughly enjoyable films, more so than expected them to be, though they were not quite masterpieces. 'Rise' was exceptionally well made and very entertaining, provoked thought and had heart. 'Dawn' had a bigger and bolder approach and delivered just as much, if not more so, on the brains and heart.So naturally, expectations for 'War for the Planet of the Apes' were quite large. Unfortunately, despite really wanting to like it (have never watched a panned film expecting to hate it or an acclaimed expecting to love it, regardless of the general consensus, always thinking for myself and always try to be respectful and perceptive), 'War for the Planet of the Apes' was a disappointment. It is a long way from a terrible film, and is not deserving of the 1/10 ratings it's garnered (it's a 4 at least), that implies that there are no redeeming qualities at all that coming from a subjective person that is further from the truth, but out of the 2010's rebooted 'Planet of the Apes' trilogy it's the weakest by quite some way.There are a number of things to admire about 'War for the Planet of the Apes'. The best things about it are the production values and the design and characterisation of the apes. Simply put, the production values all round are exceptional. Once again the cinematography and lighting are of great beauty and the scenery is strikingly atmospheric. It's the special effects and make-up that deserve the most praise, that the apes look so real and that it is hard to believe they were made with a mix of motion-capture and CGI key frame is once again testament to how good they look. Characterisation for them is every bit as incredible. When they communicate they don't need to say much and it is the most nuanced the film gets, when saying or doing little (as little as a glance or a gesture) it still feels like they're saying a lot.Just as good is the character and performance of Caesar. He has always been a hugely relatable and complex character and is much more compelling than any of the human characters here. One really roots for him, he is impeccably designed and remarkably nuanced in how he moves and communicates and he actually feels like a real character. One cannot talk about the film and not mention Andy Serkis, the man very rarely fails to amaze me and he gives an intensely moving portrayal of Caesar, definitely deserving of award recognition.A few of the action sequences are thrilling with much visceral tension in the best moments. The first 15-20 minutes are remarkably promising and highly suggestive of it being a good film. Although very closely indebted seemingly to Colonel Kurtz from 'Apocalypse Now', Woody Harrelson gives it his all and fares well compared to the rest of the human cast.On the other hand, the human characters are nowhere near as well-written or compelling as the apes. Many are underwritten to the point of banality, underused and some add little to nothing to the story (especially the little girl). Harrelson aside, the acting from the humans isn't so hot either, the little girl is really annoying and very overwrought.The script is also very messy, lacking the intelligent simplicity and nuance of the previous two films, and instead resorting to awkwardness and cheesiness. The story started off promisingly but went down the plug fast. The pacing became incredibly dull and stayed that way for most of the film, seriously struggling to sustain the overlong running time, and is filled with crass and gratuitous graphic violence, cartoonish villainy that has more cheese than threat, a strong lack of emotional core and tension, nothing to drive the story forward and a general lack of cohesion. Things feel very rushed, leaden and confused in the final act.Matt Reeves did a great job directing 'Dawn...'. Here one really questions what happened and whether it really is the same guy. His direction here is overblown and lethargic, things that he very cleverly avoided previously. 'War...' is big on the spectacle and looks mighty impressive, but is one of those big and noisy films that forgets to properly tell a story or do anything with most of the characters. It also feels heavy-handed in its portrayal of fascism and slavery. One gets what the war of the title is referring to, but with only the characterisation of the apes working the tension and conflict just doesn't work.All in all, looks amazing but not the sort of film that makes one think or treat its audience with respect and it is severely lacking in heart and soul. 5/10 Bethany Cox",War for the Planet of the Apes
1,Leofwine_draca,Often embarrassing,3,27 May 2020,"WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES is the third of this lacklustre trilogy of revamps and hopefully the last. You're better off sticking with the originals, because the only thing good about these films is the calibre of the special effects; unsurprisingly they're better than ever this time around, and you don't question any of the simians for a moment. Sadly, the trade-off comes in the sloppy writing and random focusing on silly sentimentality, with the momentum often grinding to a halt to deliver one excruciating tear-jerking moment after another. It's silly and embarrassing, sitting ill at ease with the pantomime action found elsewhere in the movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes
2,SnoopyStyle,some issues,7,2 May 2018,"Caesar (Andy Serkis) leads his ape society in the forest. They are under constant attack by soldiers commanded by The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) with Koba's surviving ape supporters serving as donkeys. The Simian flu is infecting humans turning them mute and mentally devolved. Caesar leads a team to follow The Colonel. They are joined by a mute girl and a zoo monkey called Bad Ape.There is amazing CGI work here with the ape characters. They are near perfect. This is a pretty dark episode in the Apes franchise. I like the darkness but there are some issues with the story. I don't buy any reason for Caesar to leave behind his tribe. It could only be revenge and I don't like it. I don't buy all the ape prisoners either. It seems more likely that most if not all of them would be murdered by the soldiers. I don't see them taking prisoners. When the enemy soldiers arrived in front of the compound, there was one moment of greatness that almost came to being. I wish that the enemy army is made up of apes. That would be an amazing reveal like the original's Statue of Liberty. It gets buried and the opportunity is lost. Bad Ape is an unexpected and great turn. Despite some great work, I have some issues.",War for the Planet of the Apes
3,Prismark10,Going bananas,3,3 June 2018,"War for the Planet of the Apes starts of a with an exhilarating battle scene in the forest between apes and humans. The humans are no match to the now battle hardened apes led by Caesar who shows the human survivors mercy and offers them a truce.However the soldiers led by The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) and aided by a few of Koba's surviving ape supporters, attack Caesar's fortress killing his wife and son. Caesar swears revenge but finds himself imprisoned with the rest of the apes who are treated as slaves having to build a wall. The humans are still affected by Simian flu which makes some of them mute. A mute girl, a zoo monkey and a few of Caesar's allies must mount a rescue attempt of the imprisoned apes so Caesar can take them to a desert paradise.The story may have inspiration from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness with the Colonel character. However after a promising beginning this becomes a dull, stupid film. The story is clunky, illogical and ponderous. As the final part of a trilogy that promised so much, I thought they might deliver a conceptually interesting ending but that was too much to hope for.",War for the Planet of the Apes
4,claudio_carvalho,Exhausted Franchise,6,15 October 2017,"Caesar decides to move to a place across the desert with the other apes to end the war with humans and live in peace. However they are attacked in a cave hidden by a waterfall and Caesar loses his wife Cornelia and his son Blue Eyes and only Cornelius survives. Caesar decides to revenge on their death and separates from the other apes to hunt down The Colonel (Woody Harrelson), who was the responsible for killing his family. However Maurice, Luca en Rocket follow him while the other apes head to the safe place. Along the journey of Caesar and his friends, they stumble upon the mute girl Nova and the chimpanzee Bad Ape that go with them. They arrive at the border and find a facility where his clan has been captured by The Colonel and forced to build a wall without water or food. But Caesar is captured by The Colonel and learns that he has slaughtered infected humans. Now the army is coming to kill him and he is protecting his men and himself with a wall. What will Caesar do?""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is another film is the third chapter of the franchise that shows that it is completely exhausted. The story shows moral values, great special effects but now with the death of Caesar that accomplished his mission, let his clan of apes rest in peace in the paradisaical spot and finish this franchise. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Planeta dos Macacos: A Guerra"" (""Planet of the Apes: The War"")",War for the Planet of the Apes
5,nogodnomasters,I think you have no mercy.,9,30 July 2017,"Minor mid plot explanation.The movie opens with a few written lines to recap the last film.The war consists of 5 different sides, similar to Syria with no real solution. Caesar (Andy Serkis) is the leader of the main ape group, protagonist, as he shows the most ""humanity."" The apes who started the war with the humans have now joined with the humans against Caesar, a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Humans are into three groups. The virus has caused a group of humans to become mute. They are pacifists and have moved to the country side. Woody Harrelson leads a second human group who wants to exterminate the virus infected mute humans and keeps apes as prisoners and slave labor. There is a third group of humans who don't want to kill the mutes, so they want to kill Woody's group. They don't like apes either.Woody Harrelson plays a serious role without his usual humor. There is plenty of homage paid to the original film which I loved, especially in the selection of names, ""Nova"" being the most obvious. The X frames on which apes were hung and the marching army reminded me of the original film. Steve Zahn as ""Bad Ape"" reminded my of Golem....sorry guys wrong film. It seems they were attempting to create a film that could tie into the original masterpiece if we would substitute a virus for an atomic bomb.Better than I expected.",War for the Planet of the Apes
6,kosmasp,Between the (front) lines,7,12 September 2017,"Don't expect to see full on war .. it's more Guerilla War tactics and all that. Also it's war on many fronts and it's more of a road movie in war times. Now for a movie to work you need a really strong villain. And Woody Harrelson has that charisma to pull it off. He also has a very memorable scene very early on to justify that status and solidify him in that more than evil role.Unfortunately this cannot be sustained throughout. Still while he may lose some of his drive and certain predictable things happen, there is a lot of Drama and a lot of Action happening to keep you on the edge of your seat. The effects get better with every movie of course. And overall the new PotA movies do justice to the legacy of the old ones, who surely will look outdated to some.",War for the Planet of the Apes
7,classicsoncall,"""Now, I fight only to protect apes.""",8,10 February 2018,"I'm still astounded by the incredible makeup that goes into creating the ape characters in these 'Planet of the Apes' movies. The facial features are so expressive that you would think they're the real deal. I think that's primarily what draws me to these pictures, as the stories become somewhat formulaic over time. What caught my attention in this one had almost nothing to do with the story per se, but the little things inserted by the film makers that brought back a hint of nostalgia for this viewer. Like the 'Bedtime for Bonzo' helmet on one of the human soldiers in the early part of the movie, and the Chevy II Nova chrome plate that showed up as one of the artifacts in the film. My first car was a 1969 Chevy Nova, so that's where the reference resonates with me. 'Ape-Pocalypse Now' was a bit of a stretch, but what the heck, that was kind of cool too.Interestingly, this was the second movie in a row I've seen in which Woody Harrelson kills himself. Out of sequence as I write this, but I saw ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" just the other day, and this one has Harrelson's character doing himself in too. It didn't seem like it had to go that way, so I guess The Colonel's condition was beyond hope, even though it didn't look that bad to me. The thing that bothered me in the picture was the lack of a back story to the young girl, given the name Nova (Amiah Miller) by the Orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval). One assumes she was the daughter of the soldier that was killed by the ape band, but it occurred to me that didn't necessarily have to be so. It would have been welcomed to have her character expanded a bit on.The way the story ended was kind of novel. The avalanche wiping out both The Colonel's men and the attacking soldiers from the North had the effect of wiping the slate clean so the apes could move on. Unfortunately though, just like the Bible character Moses, our hero Caesar never makes it with his troop to the Promised Land.",War for the Planet of the Apes
8,jboothmillard,War for the Planet of the Apes,4,22 July 2017,"The Planet of the Apes movies have been going since 1968, and the recent reboot series has been very successful, Rise of... being very good, and Dawn of... being fantastic, so I was hoping the third would also be great, directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Let Me In, Rise of the Planet of the Apes). Basically it has been 15 years since the ALZ-113 virus, or the Simian Flu, spread across the globe killing billions of people, following the previous events, the highly intelligent apes, led by chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) have remained in the woods. The apes are attacked by a military faction known as Alpha-Omega, a group of soldiers, who have also recruited service apes who followed Koba (Toby Kebbell), the bonobo who previously failed a coup against Caesar, some AO militants are captured and reveal that they follow the leadership of a ruthless Colonel (Woody Harrelson). The prisoners are released as a peace offering to the humans, but Caesar plans to relocate the clan across the desert, not wanting to suffer any more ape casualties, but during the night Alpha-Omega infiltrates the apes' base, and the Colonel kills Caesar's wife Cornelia (Judy Greer), and their eldest son Blue Eyes (Max Lloyd-Jones). Leaving his younger son Cornelius (Devyn Dalton) and the other apes to head for the desert, Caesar departs to exact revenge on the Colonel, accompanied by Maurice the orangutan (Karin Konoval), Luca the gorilla (Michael Adamthwaite) and Rocket the chimpanzee (Terry Notary). Caesar's party are confronted by traitorous albino gorilla Winter (Aleks Paunovic) in an Alpha- Omega camp, they learn the Colonel has departed for a location called the ""border"", Caesar inadvertently kills Winter, causing him to have visions of Koba, he worries he is becoming like him. During their journey, they find an abandoned village, there is a man who they kill when he reaches for his rifle, then they discover his daughter (Amiah Miller), who is unable to speak, Maurice insists they take her with them. Further along, they discover some Alpha-Omega soldiers who have been shot and abandoned, there is a survivor, and examining him they find he is like the mute girl, unable to speak. Later the group meet chimpanzee hermit Bad Ape (Steve Zahn), who before the Simian Flu pandemic lived in the Sierra Zoo, he directs them to the border, a former weapons depot turned into a quarantine facility after the virus began to spread. Arriving at the facility, Luca is killed protecting Caesar from an Alpha-Omega patrol, Caesar is motivated to proceed alone, he witnesses the rest of his ape clan being forced into slavery, building a wall, with no food or water, then Caesar is captured by militant gorilla Red (Ty Olsson). Caesar comes face to face with the Colonel, he reveals that the Simian Flu virus has mutated, it now causes humans who survived the original strain to become mute and regress back to a primitive state, the Colonel is barricading himself in the facility, he believes the solution is to kill any infected humans, including his own son, to stop the spread of the virus. While Caesar is tortured with starvation, Rocket allows himself to be captured as a diversion, so the mute girl, whom Maurice names Nova, can sneaks into the facility to give Caesar food and water. Together, Caesar and Rocket plan an escape, using underground tunnels leading out of the facility, Maurice and Bad Ape use the tunnel to rescue the apes, Caesar orders them to make get away, while he goes to confront the Colonel. The facility comes under attack by rival military who want to defeat AO, Caesar reaches the Colonel, but realises he has been infected by the mutated virus, he spares his life, but the Colonel kills himself, rather than exist as a primitive. During the battle between Alpha-Omega and the rival militants, the escaping apes come under fire from AO, Caesar attempts to attack them from behind, but he is shot by human militant Preacher (Gabriel Chavarria), whom he previously set free. Red saves Caesar at the cost of his own life, and Caesar blows up the facility's fuel supplies, causing an explosion and avalanche, the Alpha-Omega are wiped and the rival militants are triumphant, but the human forces are buried by the avalanche, the apes and Nova survive by climbing nearby trees. In the end, the remaining apes depart the facility and cross the desert to find a paradise- like oasis, the apes joyously celebrate finding their new home, but Maurice discovers Caesar is fatally wounded, Caesar assures him the apes will progress with or without him, and that he will be remembered, he quietly dies. Serkis remains poignant and assertive under the motion- captured, while Harrelson as the power-crazed villain is almost too similar to Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, he cannot compete with Marlon Brando, obviously the special effects have become more advanced, making the CGI creatures and action much more realistic and incredible, and it is nice to see little bits from the original films returning, e.g. a silent girl named Nova, the big problem with this sequel is that story is not as thought-provoking as before, it is slow the majority of the time, only the fight sequences are memorable, it is unclear if the series will continue, a disappointing but reasonable science-fiction thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Okay!",War for the Planet of the Apes
9,ma-cortes,"Nice third installment with epic moments , noisy action , thrills , and overwhelming battles",7,15 November 2019,"This War of the Planet of Apes is an intense and exciting film with great visual effects by means of Motion Capture technology . The picture delivers enough energy and turns out to be an impressive flick full of fighting, action , battles and suspense . An acceptable Ape movie with huge production design in which the performers are very fine , and special mention for Andy Serkis who provides the sturdy central pivot the tale surely needs . There concerns Caesar (masterfullly incarnated by Andy Serkis, Gollum alter-ego) , a chimpanzee who gained human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug that rose to a super-intelligent chimp who leads an ape upheaval . As Caesar and his apes : gorilla , chimpanzee and orangutan , are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel . Along the way the apes suffer unimaginable losses and Caesar (Andy Serkis), a Chimpanzee raised like a child by the drug's creator (first outing with Will Rodman: James Franco) . Here Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and starts his own mythic quest to avenge his kind that is being submitted in slavery and apartheid . Later on , Caesar is locked and seeking justice for his fellow primates , as they carry out a riot in which simians turn the tables . As simians , Chimpanzees , gorillas uprising violently every human in sight . As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) are pitted against each other in an impressive battle that will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet.This awesome film is a brilliant and intelligent sequel that contains fights , thrills , frenetic action , go riding , violence , breathtaking scenes and a strong denounce about animal mistreat . Dramatic as well as spectacular film in which simians undergo a rebellion against humans and winding up at a climatic final . Recent sequel in the series based on Pierre Boulle novel initiated by the mythical film ¨Planet of Apes¨ (1968) by Franklyn J. Schaffner that at time of its release regarded as the most extraordinary Scifi in years . It deals with a Chimpanzee hero called Caesar well played by Andy Serkis , this is the third film in which Andy Serkis plays an ape, having previously portrayed 2005's version of King Kong and he was also the motion capture actor for Gollum in Lord of the Rings . Highlights of the movie are the spectacular ending scenes when happens a fierce confrontation between a human army and the simians commanded by Caesar . As Caesar leads an animal revolt against his human captors and mankind in which humans battle the apes led by the intelligent ape . The flick plenty of metaphysical significance with thoughtful reflexion about vengeance , apartheid , upon origin of human being , racism , and mistreating ; though also packs action , adventures , intrigue and entertainment . Being mostly a decent follow-up of the former stories , with big moments of energy remaining throughout and it results to be , particularly , a breathtaking Sci-Fi movie full of frantic action , battles, suspense and top-notch FX by Oscarized team who made Avatar and Lord of the Rins . The performers , particularly Andy Serks and Woody Harrelson are pretty good , the characters are well drawn and in spite of excessive computer generator frames all of them are still oddly convincing . Although several elements of the screenplay strain credibility to the limit the story turns out to be pretty interesting and amusing . This film is considered to be the third live action film to have its main hero as a thoughtful, feeling , self aware animal . Andy Serkis's distinctive features prove to be recognisable even under ¨Motion Capture¨ FX images . One of the first feature films to use motion-capture in a so-called 'on location' setting , formerly , motion-capture was limited to special studio set up with special ¨motion-capture¨ cameras in very clearly defined surroundings . Similar the previous films, this is an Apes movie to have CGI apes and with arm extensions . Remaining cast formed by Gorilla , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice , in spite of overlong scenes in Motion Capture they are still nicely and compellingly made . Writing credits by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver , along with Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves himself , their screenplay is just clever and including interesting issues about human being and animals . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and luminous cinematography by Michael Seresin . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Michael Giacchino , it's full of fury and sound . Motion picture was well directed by Matt Reeves (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes , Let me in , Cloverfield)
Other adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are as follows : The original and the best is ¨Planet of Apes¨ by Franklyn J. Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , followed by ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970) with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it's followed by three inferior sequels : Escape from the planet of apes , Conquest for battle of Apes and Battle for Planet of Apes. A reboot Planet of Apes 2011 by Tim Burton . And new remakes : Rise of the planet of Apes 2011, and Dawn of the Planet of Apes (2014) .",War for the Planet of the Apes
10,BA_Harrison,That poor horse.,6,24 February 2020,"War for the Planet of the Apes. Sounds epic, doesn't it? Humans and chimps locked in mortal combat for the supremacy of the planet. Which makes it all the more of a let-down that the majority of this third movie in the rebooted franchise doesn't feature any such action. Most of the film follows chimp Caesar (Andy Serkis) as he makes his way to a human military base where he hopes to take revenge on The Colonel (Woody Harrelson), the man who killed his wife and child.Along the way, Caesar encounters both human and apes, some of whom join him on his travels (including a comedy relief chimp called Bad Ape, and a young mute girl called Nova, a nod towards Linda Harrison's character in the original The Planet of the Apes movie). When Caesar is captured and taken to be tortured in the Colonel's ape work-camp, these new friends help him to escape. Of the 140 minute run-time, only the final 20 minutes or so contain any scenes that could be described as 'war', as a human battalion attacks The Colonel's stronghold; the apes are caught in the crossfire as they try to flee.Judging by the film's current IMDb rating of 7.4, Caesar's emotional journey seems to have satisfied many viewers. Me? I longed for hordes of angry apes on horseback firing machine guns (the best thing about the previous movie), but I was left wanting, my disappointment compounded by the fact that the digital effects for this third film have finally come close to convincing me that the apes are real (the CGI has really improved since 2011) and an all-out inter-species battle could have been something truly spectacular. Oh well, maybe next time.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb (although I very nearly rounded my rating down because -- and you can call me picky, if you like -- I refuse to believe that a horse could support the weight of a fully grown gorilla).",War for the Planet of the Apes

Actually, it serves well enough to even be a stand-alone movie, although a lot of information is missing out if you haven't seen the other movies.The movie starts out in a fairly good pace, and it never really slows down, so once you strap yourself into your seat, just hang on and enjoy the ride.The movie has great CGI and special effects, of course. It is primed with lots of action and nicely executed action sequences. But it is not just the action that carries the movie, it is also the character progression and the storyline, which both actually play very big parts in this movie.""War of the Planet of the Apes"" had good acting performances from a pretty interesting cast, with the likes of Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson, Steve Zahn and many others.If you enjoyed the franchise thus far, then it would be a shame to miss out on the 2017 ""War of the Planet of the Apes"".",War for the Planet of the Apes
12,BandSAboutMovies,Pretty decent,5,5 January 2020,"Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves wrote this installment, with Reeves returning to direct. Two years after the human-hating Koba attacked humans - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Caesar and his tribe of intelligent apes have been forced to fight against Alpha-Omega, a military faction led by The Colonel (Woody Harrelson), who uses the apes loyal to Koba as his soldiers, calling them donkeys and Caesar's troops kongs.After Disney bought Fox this year, it was thought that this would be the last film in this universe. However, Wes Ball (The Maze Runner) is directing another sequel that is supposedly taking place in the same continuity.This film has way less humans in it - save the Alpha-Omega and army troops that fight one another and the mute Nova, who befriends Maurice. Steve Zahn also shows up as Bad Ape, a chimpanzee who lived in a zoo before the flu outbreak led to the apes moving up the evolutionary ladder.All the apes want to do is find a place in the desert that will be an oasis for them, so that Caesar can raise his sons Blue Eyes and Cornelius in peace. However, getting there will mean going through hell and confronting the past, where Koba had to die. It will cost him a son, a wife and nearly his own life to find the heaven on Earth that the apes deserve. If the goal was for Caesar to become the Moses of the apes, this movie certainly achieves that.After all, Maurice, an orangutan, makes the promise to tell Caesar's story to his son.

Yes, this is the best film of the franchise to me, helped by CGI effects at their peak. But there is no real surprise, if you already know the American blockbusters for over 13. I particularely noticed Woody Harrelson in colonel Kurz like character, of course a tribute to APOCALYPSE NOW's character played by Marlon Brando. The tribute is so obvious when we see this secluded colonel, commander in chief of an army of mercenaries, shaving his head with a razor and talking in some enigmatic manner with his visitors in his.dark room.

15,Theo Robertson,More Of A Walk Than A War,6,25 July 2017,Their stronghold attacked by humans where several apes are taken prisoner Caesar leads a posse to defeat the humans in their own stronghold I can't say I'm a fan of this Apes reboot. Okay the Cap-Mo brought to life by Andy Serkis and others is impressive and unlike the original film franchise the apes don't look like Homo Sapiens wearing monkeys masks that were bought from the nearest fancy dress shop. That is sadly the only aspect of the reboot beats the originals. The originals had a deranged quality that had you convinced it'd be impossible to bring out a sequel but not only brought out a sequel but even managed to develop key point plots seen in earlier films. Just to repeat I'm not a fan of this Ape reboot but still caught WFTPOTA to see how things panned out though expectations were far from high These low expectations were just about met but even so I still felt the film could have been much better. The main flaw is that Caesar and the other apes are the focus of the story. Yeah I know we're supposed to sympathise with the simians but who'd you rather run in to during a nice nature ramble ? Would it be another human being or a monkey with a machine gun ? Yeah exactly . There's also a limited amount of drama you can wring out of monkeys on horseback and almost an hour of chimpanzee characters riding about on horseback gets very boring very quickly . Then when the human antagonists make an appearance you're instantly struck that the film's trump card - Woody Harrelson as the nameless Colonel - hasn't featured enough. Make no mistake Harrelson is by far the best thing about the movie and leads to this latest- last ? - instalment is something of a disappointment in a trilogy that has been disappointing,War for the Planet of the Apes

Part the aforementioned ""Now"" mixing in ""The Searchers"" and ""Unforgiven"" the plot while familiar is engaging largely thanks to the motion-capture actors emoting for their CGI avatars with truly empathetic results (dare you not to shed some tears particularly with sign-language speaking Maurice, the sad-visaged and wise orangutan thanks to Konoval) and much needed comic relief with Zahn's Bad Ape.

Now, that's both: not saying much and saying a lot. It's not saying much because there are only a handful of good trilogies. But it's saying a lot because there are so many abysmal trilogies, so the odds were incredibly against this series being even halfway decent.If Dawn of the Planet of the Apes didn't establish the apes as intelligent sovereign creatures with no other desire than to be left alone, The War for the Planet of the Apes did. We were given a deeper and longer look inside of their lives as this movie spent more time giving us the apes than the first two.The lead primate, Caesar, finds his community under attack again. He is faced with the choices of flee to a more remote location or take the fight to the humans. It's not an easy choice to be certain because those that they are up against now are trained soldiers.The movie goes far beyond that though. It is a layered story with several portentous moments. Regardless of whether you're an ardent animal hater or merely indifferent to the plight of lesser creatures, this movie will give you pause over the conflict between the apes and the humans.War for the Planet of the Apes is excellent and it only enhances what came before it.",War for the Planet of the Apes
18,neil-476,A good conclusion to the trilogy,8,9 May 2018,"The third film in this series of motion-capture CGI reboot movies has a simple plot. Two groups are struggling to survive, but one believes the other must be destroyed. At the heart of the conflict are the two leaders. Intelligent chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) is familiar to us from Dawn and Rise, the two earlier films. The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) is the new antagonist, in charge of many soldiers and much weaponry, and determined to wipe out the apes.Woody Harrelson is best known as a comedic actor, but there is nothing funny about The Colonel. The character is well-written, with a strong and sympathetic motivation for his actions. The scene where he explains this is truly chilling. It shows you his human pain and the inhuman result of it. Harrelson is as good in this as he has ever been.The Colonel and Caesar are well matched as antagonist and protagonist. Both characters have some justification, which gives their conflict meaning. Andy Serkis doesn't just wear the mo-cap suit as Caesar, he gives a performance of subtlety and power. This is another screen character, like Gollum in The Lord Of The Rings, worthy of Oscar nomination. It's a shame that the Academy still doesn't have a category for Best Mo-capped Performance.There is a big chunk of prison break material at the two-thirds mark. It is very entertaining and action packed, but you've probably seen it before. The Great Escape and Toy Story 3 come to mind. This film is probably the most action-oriented of the three movies, and it is all well staged. You never think ""Those apes are amazing creations"" while you are watching, you just accept them as screen reality. Only afterwards do you realise that the apes riding horses, integrating with people, snow, fire and water, and giving solid dramatic performances, don't actually exist at all outside a computer. The interaction between reality and digital creation is photo-realistically perfect.I thought the filmmakers had been a little too cute with name-checking the Apes history. We have references to Cornelius, Zira and Blue Eyes from the 1960s Apes films. Then we have orangutan Maurice, named for Maurice Evans who played orangutan Dr Zaius in those films. Worse, we have a little girl given the name Nova after a character who originally appeared in Pierre Boulle's source novel Monkey Planet in 1963. Nova has little plot relevance. A better character is Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) a well-written character who is funny and sad, and moves the story along.This film definitely provides closure for this trilogy, but there is scope for the Apes' tale to continue, and Andy Serkis has said as much. So it may be that the Law of Hollywood will apply - if it make enough money, a sequel may happen. But, if it doesn't, this film is a good way to close things.",War for the Planet of the Apes
19,ferguson-6,best of the trilogy,8,11 July 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Counting the original in 1968, this is the ninth Planet of the Apes film (sourced from the Pierre Boulle novel), and the third in the most recent reimagining – including Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014). That's almost 50 years of talking apes questioning the role, purpose and intent of humans. Director Matt Reeves (Let Me In, Cloverfield) is back after 'Dawn' and clearly has an affinity for the characters and the continuing saga. This one is by far the most personal  if that's the right term when applied to a species other than persons! Opening with the film's best battle scene (and perhaps the most superb and vivid of the franchise); the film stuns us with the realism of apes on horseback and searing violence that rivals any war film. We are immediately drawn in by the thrilling and intimate battle scenes, and the accompanying adrenaline rush. It's a beautiful and heart-pounding opening that will surely satisfy even the most demanding action-oriented fans. This is also when we notice that Michael Giacchino's score as a complementary thing of beauty and not just more over-the-top action film music bravado.The great Andy Serkis returns as Caesar, the leader of the apes, and dare I say, one of the most exciting and dynamic recurring characters in the movie universe. This third film belongs to Caesar and we see his intelligence, personality and skills have evolved in each. His human nemesis this time is Woody Harrelson in Colonel Kurtz psycho-war lord mode. In the years since ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", a simian virus has wiped out much of the human race and now the last two human factions (one led by Harrelson) are preparing for a final epic war, while at the same time, all remaining humans are united against apes.Apes simply want to be left alone in the forest, but humans focused on their destruction are forcing the apes to fight. One particular attack causes Caesar to erupt in anger and strive for revenge, providing the foundation for a movie with less action than the previous two, and a more concerted focus on story and character. Some may be disappointed in this. Others (like me) will find it fascinating.Joining Serkis/Caesar for a third round are Terry Notary as Rocket and Karin Konoval as Maurice (orangutan). Also returning is Toby Kebbel as Koba – this time in a manner that really messes with Caesar's mind. Steve Zahn steals his scenes as the comedy relief chimp known only as ""bad ape"", with Judy Greer as Cornelia, and young Amiah Miller as Nova (same name as Linda Harrison in the original). Nova is a human girl who seems to fit much more with the apes than the warmongering humans. Fans of the original will also note Caesar's son is named Cornelius (the same as Roddy McDowell's ape in the original). Director Reeves delivers what would be a fitting end to a trilogy, but there is likely to be yet another if fans can appreciate that the series has evolved every bit as much as the apes.",War for the Planet of the Apes
20,FlashCallahan,Could be the perfect live action trilogy......,10,12 July 2017,"Caesar is forced into a deadly conflict with a ruthless colonel, after his eldest son and wife are slaughtered. After unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker side and begins his own quest to avenge his kind. As his journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the colonel are pitted against each other in a battle that will determine the fate of both of their species and the future of the planet..........First off, anyone who wants to use the term 'Ape-pocalypse Now', don't bother, it's literally used in the film.And what a film. After a plethora of worthless 'blockbusters' released this year, this treats the audience like they have a brain, rather than having the script spout Basil Exposition every three minutes.And as for the script, there are large portions of the film where there is no dialogue, we just focus on Caesar and his journey. But in these sections, dialogue isn't really needed, we can see the pain in Caesars face and gait, and it carries the narrative far more than having dialogue for the sake of it.The film is technically brilliant, the apes are so lifelike, you forget that the are nothing more than actors in 'Running Man' jump suits covered in mini ping pong balls. And if this film doesn't win a plethora of awards, there is something wrong with the planet (of the apes).Serkis is perfect as Caesar, show more human emotion than any of the human characters, his journey is a long and painful one, and I know the air conditioning was on, but I felt really cold during the second and final act.Harrelson as the Colonel, does have similarities to Kurtz from Apocalypse Now, but he is more similar to Barnes from Platoon, as he has method in his madness, and one prolonged scene between him and Caesar is touching as well as sinister, him explaining the reasoning of why he is doing what he's doing.Talking about similarities, whilst watching this, I was reminded of several films. The Revenant, Deliverance, Saving Private Ryan, Temple Of Doom, The Last Castle, and even Braveheart, but I wasn't longing to see any of these films because I was fully involved in this from beginning to end.Zahn is a welcome addition as 'Bad Ape' and even if the film is very serious, he provides a lot of laugh out loud moments.It's a real big thing to say, but in my opinion, it's the perfect live action trilogy, the film film ends perfectly, they couldn't have done anything else to make it better.Bookended with two wonderfully crafted set pieces, WFTPOTA (which no one is calling it) could be one of the films of the year. The film making is so perfect, you forget you are watching a film where 80 percent of the characters are CGI.Full of metaphorical references to apartheid, Slavery, and nature versus nurture, the film is epic on a momentous scale. It's thrilling from beginning to end.Quite wonderful.",War for the Planet of the Apes
21,trashgang,still delivering,8,3 October 2017,"Why does flicks have to clock in over two hours nowadays. The problem you get is that some scenes are way too long and some parts are even boring but luckily for the apes, this part into the franchise didn't bore me at all.There's not that much of action going on but Caesar takes the lead again and does keep you attracted towards the screen, not only by his conversations but just look at his expressions on his face, wow, the CGI is top notch.But to make it more watchable they added Bad Ape into the story, a funny little ape that has a slapstick feeling in his reactions and doings.I do know that some hate this entry into the franchise because there's a lot of blah blah taking place but I liked it a lot. Only the ending with the avalanche is a bit over the top and too sentimental so they could have let that out.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1/5",War for the Planet of the Apes

I am a fan of this trilogy and I am glad that for once the movies don't get worse like they mostly do in other sequels. Maybe this one is not the best one in this trilogy but it is for sure entertaining and that's what it's all about for me when I watch a movie. It's a long movie and maybe they could have made it shorter but in the end it's never boring. The CGI's are great, just like in the other movies. Even if you're not an animal lover like me you will of course take side with the apes. I would not say it was the best performance from Woody Harrelson though, it was just okay. Other than that I don't have anything bad to say about this movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes

And in a world where Presidents behave like dictators & discriminate the minorities, this Apes versus Humans spell-binder comes close to the current state of times we live in & questions hate & violence with thundering ferocity.

24,DKosty123,Going Ape Again,7,6 January 2018,"This is truly a war for the Planet. Caesar is once again the central character, as in the last film in the series. This time Matt Reeves who directs his second Apes film takes a hand in writing the script as well. He is leading a trek for survival away from 2 deadly groups of humans.One of these groups is led by Woody Harrelson as The Colonel, and at first he appears to be the only problem. Then another group of humans appear, and this group wants to take out the Colonel as well as the apes. The apes figure out they need to escape from the West Coast across a vast desert. It is not easy. and there are lots of twists and turns a long the way. This is another solid entry in a series that just keeps on selling tickets at the box office. This film the Apes seem even more realistic than ever in the costumes and make up. CGI has definitely helped this series as the battles are more convincing than ever. 2018 marks 50 years since FOX, nearly bankrupt, started this series in 1968. These first installments kept FOX in business until Star Wars Episode 4 put the studio back into the black. The first film was the most amazing advance in ape make-up during the 1960's. Realism for these costumes just keeps getting better.",War for the Planet of the Apes
25,Hellmant,It's undeniable that this reboot series is far superior to the original franchise!,9,20 July 2017,"'WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the 'PLANET OF THE APES' reboot film series. It once again stars Andy Serkis as Caesar, the leader of a tribe of genetically modified apes, this time leading his people in an all- out war against the humans for complete control of the planet. The film was directed by Matt Reeves (who also directed the last chapter) and it was written by Reeves and Mark Bomback (who also co-wrote 'DAWN OF THE PLANTE OF THE APES'). The film costars Woody Harrelson, Steve Zahn, Amiah Miller, Karin Konoval, Ty Olsson, Judy Greer and Terry Notary. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also another big hit at the Box Office. I really enjoyed it too.The story picks up two years after the end of the last film, when Caesar (Serkis), and the other apes, have been at war with the humans for quite some time. Some apes, that used to follow Koba (Toby Kebbell), have joined the humans in trying to hunt down Caesar and his followers. When a crazy Colonel (Harrelson) executes Caesar's wife (Greer) and child, Caesar becomes obsessed with hunting the Colonel and his army down. A dark (and very violent) war persists.What most impressed me about the film is that it almost solely focuses on the ape characters (especially Caesar), unlike the first two movies (which had multiple central human characters in them too). Harrelson is great as the human villain, and it's funny to see a veteran vegan (of 30-years) playing the violent oppressor of animals in this movie too, but his on screen time is very limited. Serkis is the star of the movie, and the astonishing special effects, and they both magnificently deliver. Reeves' direction, and script, are also both superb. The film is an epic war movie, that definitely deserves to be seen on the big screen, and I think it's undeniable that this reboot series is far superior to the original franchise.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Mg3uG2FLNSE",War for the Planet of the Apes

27,Robert_duder,A Masterful ending to a masterful trilogy,8,14 August 2017,"If nothing else The new Plant of The Apes series proved why ""reboots/remakes"" can be a very good thing. This series has been unbelievable for action, special effects, drama and a new twist on an old story. The character development for a group of CGI apes is completely astonishing. The first two films were staples of my previous summers. I was very excited to see the latest film and I was not disappointed. War for The Planet Of The Apes is not the best of the three but it's also more story driven and wrapping up any loose ends to this particular part of the story (Caesar's Trilogy.) The battle scenes are quite brutal and the interesting thing is you see an evolution to this trilogy where in the original film the focus was on James Franco and his pet ape, the second film balanced the human story with the Apes and now you have this third film where this is entirely from the view of the Apes as they work to build their own land and freedom. The only ""good"" human in the film is one who is almost completely de-evolved. I have always respected how much time and effort they spent on these films and that nothing was ever rushed or pushed. I think they end this perfectly and perhaps leave enough open for a new direction.I'm not sure anyone realizes what Andy Serkis has done for acting. He doesn't just motion capture is characters. He plays every aspect of this character. He made Caesar a film legend. He has depth of character and evolution over the course of three films. His emotional and brooding expressions and personality make you emotionally invested in this. Woody Harrelson is mesmerizing as the vicious Colonel who is the human embodiment of everything Caesar and his apes have been up against is perfectly cast. Steve Zahn and Karin Konoval are very good as well as Caesar's closest allies and family helping him against The Colonel. Amiah Miller is riveting as the human girl they end up taking along with them. Matt Reeves on the big screen has done some incredible work in my opinion. Let Me In was breathtaking and then Dawn of The Planet of The Apes he made a sequel that in many ways was superior to the first two and is easily one of the best mainstream films in the last decade. I think he had a strong vision for how he wanted this to go and he fulfills that perfectly. If the ultimate Blockbuster is entertaining, emotional and leaves an impression this film works but only has part of the trilogy I think. It lacks some of the depth and urgency of the first two but it does work as a closing statement to this particular chapter. Still one of the best films of the summer. 8/10",War for the Planet of the Apes

Aside from its technical mastery, this third instalment - which is just as different from 'Dawn' as 'Dawn' is from 'Rise' - manages to tell a mature and dark story that deals with serious themes without ever seeming overly-serious or dour, perfectly portraying both a literal war and a metaphorical one within the central character himself, and once again its the genuine emotional resonance - alongside the impressive spectacle and superb score - that gives this film the lasting impact it has, allowing this consistently high-quality trilogy to truly end on a high note. 9/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
29,dromasca,'Bad Planet',4,28 July 2017,"'Planet of the Apes' generated by now enough big screen and TV series film to be considered a genre or at least a sub-genre by itself. While the original series was playing more in the post-apocalyptic stories space with the original movie one of the strong head of series creation, the more recent remake started as a sci-fi thriller. The second and now third film in the series see the two themes converge as enough bad things happened on Planet Earth for mankind to become again endangered species. Actually both apes and humans seem to be endangered in this latest War for the Planet of the Apes and the two species are caught in a deadly war that may prove to be fatal to both.The premises of the story are similar with the majority of the other films in the series. Humans have made enough fatal mistakes and their psychological, biological, but especially character problems make of them inferior (on the moral if not also on the intelligence scales) to the apes. On the ruins of what was once our civilizations gangs of human survivors and herds of ape survivors fight for their own existence and between them. It's not a modern war, it's more like tribal fights. Which is no less cruel or spectacular in cinematographic terms.When this new series started and I saw the first film (I think that I missed the second) I appreciated the technical performance of making of each one of the apes a character of its own using computer graphics enhancement, but the story seemed thin and conventional. This third film has the same problems, actually it got worse. Visuals are impressing but the story got not only conventional but full of clichés. It's a deja-vu post-apocalyptic story with religious and moralistic tones, and having it spoken 80% of the time by apes does not make it smarter. Some of the choices of director Matt Reeves also seemed to me uninspired. Some of the apes talk a sign language, other a primitive form of the language of the enemy (English, of course). Arms are an odd mix of modern weaponry, tribal bow and arrows and beginning of the 20th century guns. Female apes are wearing ear-rings. etc. It's difficult to talk too much about acting, as playing the human model for the apes computer image requires special skills - I assume they are OK as the effect is fine, but it's not a novelty any longer and the film relies too much on those. So I assume Andy Serkis is a fine actor but I need to see more of him, while Woody Harrelson does what we expect from him in the human bad guy role.The ending of the original 'Planet of the Apes' was mind-blowing, one of the most memorable final scenes in the history of cinema. What we have in 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is so far from that. The action twist and the meaningful reflection on the future of mankind that were turning the original into a great movie was replaced by a so expected and conventional image with moralistic and religious pretensions. This says almost all about the failure of this film. Faithful fans (and I am among them) will go and see this film. Many will be disappointed, as it is heavy and full of stuff that we have already seen so many times. Good cinematography and special effects are also repetitive and cannot save it. One of the characters is called Bad Ape and repeats his name many times in the movie. He may have said 'Bad Planet' as well.",War for the Planet of the Apes
30,ThomasDrufke,One of the Greatest Trilogies of All Time,9,14 July 2017,"It definitely couldn't have been predicted after Tim Burton botched his 2001 remake, but this particular reboot/re-imagining of the Planet of the Apes series proved to be one of the greatest trilogies of all time. The fact that they managed to make a film that forces an audience to root for the apes over humans is an accomplishment on its own. Caesar's arc through 3 films is one of the most unique and emotionally powerful things that any franchise has given us.Let's start out with the most obvious thing to like about War for the Planet of the Apes, the visuals. In just 6 short years, the CGI/performance capture effects have gone from being impressive to astronomically important. There are recent films that still don't hold up to the precedent set by 'Dawn' a few years ago, and I'm sure it will be years before we see anything close to what Matt Reeves and company did with 'War'. It's also worth mentioning how expanded this cast of characters is to the last film. It's not just Caesar & Koba anymore. We got a deeper look into Maurice, who has always been a favorite of mine in the past few films. Caesar's family grew, hence giving us more apes to care for. And a few new apes that I won't talk about to avoid spoilers. All of them have their own personality and look to them, which makes the visual feats even more impressive.Woody Harrelson came on board to the series as 'The Colonel', a typically bada** character name for Harrelson. Of course, it's no surprise that he stepped up to the challenge of taking on the villain role, after Gary Oldman did a wonderful job the last time around. Much like Oldman's character, the great thing about The Colonel is that he's more than just an intimidating face. As much as this is a 'war' for the planet in a literal way, it may be even more so a 'war' emotionally between Caesar and The Colonel. As expected, Reeves does a great job of balancing out the physical and emotional conflict to incredible results. Actually, because of this, the film ends up going a much more unexpected route than I imagined.The last thing I'd like to touch on is the imagery. This won't be the first review to commend how well Reeves manages to portray Caesar, but I love the way in which he's essentially made into a mythological figure. A figure that will clearly inspire them for generations and all the way up until the original timeline started in 1967's Planet of the Apes. There's nothing more terrifying for a human in this film to see hundreds and maybe even thousands of apes become inspired to revolt because of Caesar. But not just on Caesar's end, the imagery spans every character and every big moment. Nothing was broken up by untimely humor (though there was some surprisingly funny moments) and there weren't any unwarranted or unearned emotional triumphs and losses. This series took its time with storytelling, and it showed.My only real complaint would be that there's a particular group of people that get talked about quite a bit but don't ever receive the proper screen time to warrant them being considered integral to the film. But that's more of a just a comment on how MacGuffin's usually work in films and how it can be frustrating. In all, it's hard to imagine a better conclusion to the Apes trilogy. In my mind, there's no real need to continue it unless it's an unbelievable script, but this was Caesar's arc, and it was perfect.+Satisfying in every possible way+Brutal but emotional+The beautiful imagery+Harrelson and Serkis play well off each other9.7/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
31,Cineanalyst,Mutated and Muted Aping,4,4 April 2020,"First, people put apes in cages in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011). Then, in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" (2014), apes locked humans behind bars. Now, in this third entry in the Planet of the Apes series reboot, ""War for the Planet of the Apes,"" humans put the apes back in cages. It's getting tiresome, although, really, the Planet of the Apes films started being largely stale retreads from the first sequel, ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970). This time, Caesar even engages in a revenge plot that puts other apes at risk while he worries that he's becoming like Koba--the ape who engaged in a revenge plot that put other apes at risk in the last movie. Once again, too, Caesar and company plan a prison break.Moreover, the virus mutates to align with the muteness of humans from the original films, including a female named ""Nova."" This mutation is likened to the evolutionary and Frankenstein-esque science themes of the making of the super-intelligent, sometimes-talking apes. All of which works rather well as a metaphor for the CGI and motion-capture acting that went into making these movies. Human performances are digitally aped, mutated into something else as CGI. With all of this aping, however, the innate humanity seems muted.",War for the Planet of the Apes
32,ericstevenson,Probably the best Planet Of The Apes movie ever!,9,6 August 2017,"This initially came off as too long of a movie for me, but it ended up being well worth the length. The best part is probably this great twist that's introduced that sets up a brand new mythology for the series. In this movie, it's revealed that some of the remaining humans are starting to lose the ability to talk, including this one girl whom the apes befriend. What happens is that the virus is apparently mutating and now the surviving humans are starting to lose their intelligence, reverting to ape like behavior themselves! The scene where the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) explains this is to Caesar is probably the best part in the movie.Koga was a great villain for the previous movie and it's great how we at least get him alluded to here. Even Caesar himself admits that he's starting to become like him, sincerely wanting to kill the Colonel. My only complaint is that there wasn't really a war of any kind here. It didn't have any more action than the previous installment. It was still very well written and they even explicitly mention ""Ape Shall Not Kill Ape"". Some apes do in fact work for the humans. I just wished there were more sympathetic humans here. ***1/2",War for the Planet of the Apes

34,lesleyharris30,"A Well Executed Dramatic Experience,",8,15 August 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a largely engrossing film from beginning to end as we follow these group of apes on another adventure leading up to the events of the first Planet of the Apes movie. The stakes are risen even further once again as Caesar is put up against a group of army soldiers that puts their very existence at risk. This film had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish and is without a doubt one of the most groundbreaking franchises in Hollywood at the moment.I will admit that it did not grab me as much as Rise or Dawn did, it was a lot slower, taking a lot of time to develop these characters and the new world they are living in, which is fine, but there comes a stage where we would like some action. As well as that, the majority of the movie takes place in one location, and not an exceptionally broad or interesting one, I was getting cabin fever just watching after awhile, I wanted to see these characters move elsewhere. I have absolutely no gripes with the cast here. Woody Harrelson exceeded my expectations as the Colonel, an absolutely gripping, condescending and layered villain that we love to hate. Of course, Andy Serkis hits it out of the park once again as Caesar, it never gets tiring to see him in this part. The amount of depth and vulnerability he puts in to this character is amazing, and the characters arc in this film in particular is heart breaking. An action packed, gripping movie. Proving that you can get the gold three times in a row, War for the Planet of the Apes is a must watch for fans of the series, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or adventure film. Caesar and the rest of the apes are put in great danger when a ruthless army colonel and his men try to wipe them out. Best Performance: Andy Serkis",War for the Planet of the Apes
35,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,17 October 2017,"War for the Planet of the ApesIn a society run by apes you can rest assured only evolution will be taught in school.Still, there are a few humans in this sci-fi/fantasy that favour a creationist curriculum.When a human militia led by The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) murders his family, the genetically enhanced simian Caesar (Andy Serkis) takes a troop of monkeys (Steve Zahn, Karin Konoval) with him on a mission of revenge.But Caesar's vengeance takes a backseat when he must liberate hundreds of his brethren from The Colonel's primate concentration camp before they are eradicated.While this heady conclusion to the reimagined Planet of the Apes franchise wears its historical influences on its sleeve, those inspirations make for a dark final act. Nevertheless, the smidgen of action, the endless nods to the original series and the CGI are definitely highpoints.Furthermore, with monkeys in charge you can rest assured bananas will never become extinct.

36,851222,One of The Best Movies in 2017 So Far,10,16 July 2017,"Greetings from Lithuania.""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (2017) is amazing movie. It perfectly ended this trilogy and left me wanting for more. I do hope they will create another trilogy this time focusing on humans, but seeing what incredible movies they made about apes, i want them to me great characters as well.""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is easily one of the best movies i saw this year. The craftsmanship of this movie is nothing short of amazing. Special effects were simply flawless. Not great or amazing - they were perfect. Not for a second did i thought that i was watching CGI creations in front of me - they were there, apes, with all of emotions and etc. Andy Serkis is amazing in here. Steve Zahn stole every scene as a Bad Ape - couldn't take my eyes of him - what a movie magic. Screenplay was great, deep and dark - this is a dark movie and although it is rated PG-13 its theme is more in common with ""Apocalypse Now"" - starting from theme, mood and Woody Harrelson performance which more then once remanded me of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. Overall, once again - ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is an amazing motion picture. There so many quite scenes between apes that i kinda wished they just kept going. Directing by Matt Reeves was more then great - he is truly a force in Hollywood that should be get more recognition - can't wait to see his take on solo ""Batman"" movie. Cant' recommend this movie any higher - great movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes
37,Bored_Dragon,The best part of the new trilogy,8,13 November 2018,"Technically and visually the movie is almost perfect. I believe it would leave me breathless if I saw it in the cinema. But the story itself, although very well-written, didn't excite me. The essence is touching and tragic in its truthfulness, but in my opinion, it is not presented in a sufficiently impressive way. Woody Harrelson masterfully played the role of the main ""villain"" and made me hate him with my whole being, despite the fact that he is one of my favorite actors.8/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
38,ironhorse_iv,Ape Together Strong! What a solid showing! A masterpiece. A grand finale.,8,16 July 2017,"It's time to wage war! Ape-Calypse Now Style! This is the story of 2017's 'War for the Planet of the Apes', which pits, Caesar (Motion Capture & Voiced by Andy Serkis) & his ape colony, against an army of human, led by a ruthless, Colonel McCullough (Woody Harrelson) following the events of 2014's 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, despite the film's title being about the all-out war between apes and humans, the majority of the film is centered on intense, dramatic moments between Caesar and McCullough in a prison settling. While, some people might find, that boring, because of the lack of action, I have to disagree; as those scenes did led to a lot of conflict, between the belief of total authoritarian, and swore allegiance to Colonel as a mean to control the means of the production & the populace versus the belief of working rights & unitization of the four species of ape, under consul leadership under Caesar. Not only does, these open defiance moments, help the film, but it also remind me of prison films like 1963's 'The Great Escape', 2001's 'The Last Castle', 1967's 'Cool Hand Luke' and 1994's 'Shawshank Redemption'. It also seem to me, that the film took influence from much darker prison drama films like 1993's 'Schindler's List' & 1997's 'Amistad', with its harsh allegory of race relations. While, some people might get offended by the anthropomorphism & the sinister portrayal of humanity. For the most part, people understood the story, it was going for, and let it, in. Even if, most of the movie is downright gritty gloom and doom, war & cruelty. It's clearly not for all children, with it intense sequences of violence and death. Lots of frighten imagery. Despite that, the action scenes in the film, were just as good as the prison, rebellion scene. The opening credit, alone is worth, the ticket price. This is, by far, one of my favorite movies, in the reboot, 'Planet of the Apes' series, because of the action. However, there is a few nitpicking flaws with it. One is the fact that the 3D was rarely used. So check it out, in 2D. No need to spent more money, when you don't have to. Another is the many of plot-holes, like why didn't the Colonel, just outright kill Caesar, when he first enter the prison yards? You would really think, that would end, the rebellion, before it even started, since the prisoners didn't know that he was there. Plus, it's not like, it didn't stop him, from trying to do it, before. Unless, his brain skills are so devolution by the Simian Flu that he forgot, the reasons, why he was going to kill Caesar, than I find, this act, very jarring, for somebody that favors stopping any sign of the infected with a dime of a hat. Also, it also seem to me, that his prison isn't well guarded, seeing how the Northern Army will be, heading their way, any minute. After all, a little girl was able to sneak in, and give food & water to the apes, in a long scene of time. It just doesn't add up. Despite that, Woody Harrelson was great in the sinister role. He really did look, like he could do, another action movie, at his age. Yet, there was another problem with the story besides the Colonel's odd judgments; which was, the unneeded comedy from Bad Ape (Motion Capture & Voiced by Steve Zahn). He was borderline, 'Jar Jar Binks' of annoying. It just doesn't mixed well, with the serious tone of the rest of the movie. Anyways, despite that, I do like the references and Easter eggs to the original series, throughout the film. That was fun to see. Also, I love, the story is very similar to the fifth and final entry of the original series, 1973's 'Battle for the Planet of the Apes', in tone, but is different enough, not to be a direct remake, as it does not fit into that series' continuity that well. Hopefully, the whole Icarus subplot would make sense, once it's introduce, in a future series of films. However, there is a part of me, that doesn't want any more films to continue this storyline. As I find, this reboot trilogy of movies, to be amazing on its own right, from start to finish. I really like, how the three movies establish, Caesar in 2011's 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes', developed him in ""Dawn', and had the perfect closure for that character, in this film. These three films really does cement him as a seminal figure in the fictional ape history. It would really be, hard to watch, another film, in the series, without the character, in it, or the actor that plays him, Andy Serkis, whom probably the best CGI model motion capture actor of all time. It would be a letdown. Despite, what happens, in future films, at least, I can say, this movie end the three film, very perfectly in a grand finale. The CGI work for the apes was amazing. The cinematography by Michael Seresin was breath-taking with the beaches and snowy mountains. They really do look like, they really are, there. I also have to give credit to the music by composer Michael Giacchino. It was excellent and touching. 'Nova's theme' alone will make you, cry, when hearing it. Without spoiling the end of this, Matt Reeves's film, too much. The last shot of the movie, will leave you in silence. It's that powerful. Overall: This movie is a great popcorn movie that needs to seem. So, stop monkeying around! Go see it! It's worth your time.",War for the Planet of the Apes
39,The-Sarkologist,The Saga Continues,4,29 July 2017,"In a way I'm not all that surprised that they have now released a third film in the reboot series. A part of me was thinking that maybe they are prequels, but when you consider that the original films created a time loop where apes from the future come to the present, and then give birth to a race of sentient apes, the whole prequel idea really doesn't seem to work. Further, it seems to be a movement away from the original remake, which was actually set on another world on the other side of a black hole. It seems, thus, that they have gone back to the drawing board and have have come up with these prequel reboots, for want of a better word.The problem with these series is not so much not seeing the previous films, but having seen them so long ago that one actually forgets what happened. While they do give us a bit of a recap, this film is unfortunately not one that can simply stand alone. Still, considering the fact that it was a full house when I saw it suggests that there is some popularity with the franchise. As for me, I simply saw it because I had seen the previous two, even though there was really no burning desire for me to actually go out and see this sequel.The film starts sometime after the previous film and the apes are being tracked by a militia. During one such even Caeser's wife and son are killed, so he decides to go off and seek vengeance against the killer. However, he also sends all of the other apes off to find a new home, though this doesn't work out all that well as they eventually end up being captured by the humans and put to work as slaves. Caesar also gets captured, and the film simply descends into what is basically a prison break film. Sure, there are a few twists and surprises, but in the end it is basically a film sit in a prison, where the prisoners happen to be apes.Honestly, I have to say that when I sat down to watch this film, other than feeling rather cramped in my seats, I pretty much asked myself why it was that I was actually watching this film. In part it was fun, but in the end it really just seemed to drag that little too much. I guess the whole premise of sentient apes going to war against humans, and the humans slowly dying off in favour of the apes, is something that seems to have been done to death in the past. I really didn't grab my attention, and for most of the time I was just sitting there quite restless. Maybe, just maybe, if videoshops were still around I'd be waiting for these films to come out on video where I don't have to watch it in one sitting, but since I am too stingy for Netflix, and do other things at home as opposed to watching films, I guess seeing movies of this quality is going to be what the future holds.",War for the Planet of the Apes
40,jacobjohntaylor1,This is a great movie.,9,12 June 2019,This a great movie. Down of the planet of the apes is better. But still this movie has great acting. It also has a great story line. 7.5 is underrating this movie I give it 9 out of 10.,War for the Planet of the Apes
41,paulclaassen,YAWN...is it over yet...??,3,26 June 2019,"I recently wrote about how critics rated 'Bumblebee' the highest (92%!!) in the 'Transformers' series, yet it did the worst at the box office. Well, they've done it again. 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is the highest rated by critics (93%), and it had the lowest box office takings of the reboot trilogy. Seriously, critics, I'm starting to believe you love insanely slow moving films.Yup, this film was just a drag. It was slow and overlong and every scene felt dragged out, accompanied by piano music - one key every two or three seconds...Yawn... This film was quieter than 'A Quiet Place'. This was such a yawner that I couldn't wait for the end.I mean, seriously, the film has no plot, apart from Caesar going after the humans for killing his family, and seems to take FOREVER to get there!! Along the way there are so many unnecessary scenes trying to win you over by being sentimental. Why was the little girl in the film? She served absolutely no purpose whatsoever and was a very weak character. The film is called 'War for the Planet of the Apes', but there's no war. In fact, apart from the first few minutes and the last 15 or so, there's no action. Nothing. Just talk talk talk talk talk...and that sentimental piano music!The action only arrives during the last few minutes, and it's over before you can say ""Ape!"" By that time it was anyway too late for the film to redeem itself. I was only too happy the film (finally) reached its end. SPOILER: Oh, and the antagonist (Woody Harrelson) dies by shooting himself???!! What? No battle to the end between him and Caesar?? No climatic protagonist/antagonist fight??? We just have to assume he contracted the virus, unable to speak, and them shoots himself?? Honestly...If you're looking for action, skip this film. If you're looking for a sentimental (dreary) Sunday afternoon movie, then this is for you.And critics rate this the highest. Well, I suppose they do their reviews on Sunday afternoons then... Yawn.",War for the Planet of the Apes
42,tomgillespie2002,"Often heavy-handed, but refreshingly mature stuff",7,29 July 2017,"Matt Reeves' War for the Planet of the Apes, the reboot of the classic series that also work as prequels of sorts, isn't the first ape-led movie this summer to draw inspiration from Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam classic Apocalypse Now. While Kong: Skull Island attempted to re-create some of the visuals from Coppola's masterpiece, especially the helicopters whizzing past the sunset moment that adorned the posters, it shared little of its psychological tone and gravitas. In War for the Planet of the Apes, the only obvious references are the words 'Ape-pocalypse Now' scrawled by humans in a dingy sewer, and Woody Harrelson's bald, painted and psychotic antagonist The Colonel. Yet War also shares much of its weary, exhausted tone, and the psychological effects of battle are a key theme running throughout, as is the desire for revenge driven by an unquenchable hatred.For anyone hoping to enjoy an action-packed blockbuster full of explosions and thrills will likely be disappointed, or at least take aback by how serious Reeves and co-writer Matt Bomback approach the subject matter. After the blistering finale of the previous film, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which offered the delightful sight of an ape riding a horse wielding two machine-guns, it would seem more fitting to switch the two titles around, and there is little war in this trilogy-closer, but there is certainly a dawn of something big. Beginning 2 years later, Caesar (Andy Serkis), who can now speak as eloquently as any human, is still haunted by his former ally Koba (Toby Kebbell), whose feelings of pure hatred towards his human abusers could not be quelled by Caesar's teachings of tolerance. Leading a huge tribe hiding out in the woods, they are attacked by the military but manage to defeat the small band of soldiers. After this pulse-racing opener, Reeves takes his foot off the pedal to focus on Caesar's inward struggle and personal journey.Caesar's hand in forced when some of his immediate family are murdered by a renegade militant group headed by the genocidal Colonel, who isn't given a name, or much personality until his motivation is eventually explained. Although he sets out on his quest for revenge across the snowy mountains alone, he is soon joined by his loyal companions Maurice (Karin Konoval), Luca (Michael Adamthwaite) and Rocket (Terry Notary, who also did the motion-capture for Kong), who continue to trust the judgement of the leader they have followed from the very beginning. They soon pick up a couple of new faces, the mute young human Nova (Amiah Miller), and former zoo resident and chimpanzee Bad Ape (Steve Zahn). The latter offers the series a levity so badly lacking in the previous instalments, and Zahn wonderfully captures the character's adorable mixture of naivety and weariness, as well as delivering the film's few funny moments. It soon transpires that the clan Caesar had left behind and believed to be on their way to safety have been rounded up by the Colonel and locked away in a concentration camp of sorts, so it becomes a race against time to prevent the extermination of his species.Dawn represented the very pinnacle of special effects, with the CGI rendered characters interacting seamlessly with their human counterparts, as well as the drizzly forest surrounding them. War somehow eclipses this, taking such care with its special effects that you can truly see the humanity in Caesar's eyes. Even the Colonel acknowledges this by marvelling at how almost human Caesar appears, yet this does not sway his disdain. But this shouldn't take anything away from Serkis' performance. As well as nailing the physicality of the primate's movements, he also delivers a performance of remarkable intensity, yet also one of warmth. Caesar's pacifist attitude has constantly been met with aggression, and his tolerance has taken a battering over the course of Rise and Dawn. He is an ape at the end of his tether, willing to risk certain death to see one man burn, but he also recognises the good side of humanity in the form of the harmless Nova, who has witnessed the barbarity of her species first hand. It's incredibly heavy stuff for a big-budget picture, but although some of the symbolism may be clumsily-handled in parts, this is refreshingly mature stuff. It left me with both the sensation of satisfaction after a fitting closure to the story, and the desire to see the franchise push on even further.",War for the Planet of the Apes
43,cruise01,Caesars epic emotional journey and an amazing film all around.,10,14 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is an amazing film all around. It does conclude the story arc with Caesar; from the human experiments and extinction to dealing with Kopa's hatred towards humans and going against what he believes that not all humans are bad. It is a satisfying third film that ends on a high emotional note were there is enough development that you care more for the apes than the humans. Director Matt Reeves does not leave out the emotionality on the humans as well. He does build the emotional impact on how the virus has affected them and reshape the rest of the remaining survivors. Even, when the virus has evolved and started to affect the victims from speaking. I feel like Matt Reeves was inspired by a lot of films and biblical themes to help create this plot of Caesars movement on trying to find peace for his family and apes. He is minding his own business with the humans. He is just protecting his kind from harm. Until, Colonel (Woody Harrelson) wants to wipe out all the apes and trying to save civilization. When Caesars apes are captured and forced as slaves. Caesar will do whatever it takes to set his apes free and to find them a peaceful home. The plot was amazing; it does conclude the trilogy well. Also, opening up the movie for more with other stories to tell as characters grow over the time span and become something without giving away spoilers. The film introduces bad ape (Steve Zahn) who mentions that there are other apes out there in the world that evolved like Caesar did and talk like him. It does open up that there other evolved apes like him. And also, the film brings in another human character of a little mute girl (Amiah Miller), who is lost and alone which Caesar and Maurice bring in to their group.The action sequences are breathtaking and the climax battle with the military is exciting and epic. I love the new setting and concept with Caesar and Maurice going after the colonel for his attacks towards their camp. It is an epic journey and Caesars journey as he is becoming a figure of a leader that sets his apes free and knows what is right and wrong. Caesars path towards revenge against the colonel does make him question if his hatred is making him become like Koba. The visual effects are impressive. Every detail and sequence is great. Michael Giacchino music score is beautiful and amazing. Probably one of his best works yet. Woody Harrelson as the villain, it does make him feel like a cliché villain when he walks to an outdoor camp with sunglasses at night but that is not a major issue with the film. There are a lot of great emotional moments with the film as the little girl is trying to help Caesar when he is starved and captured to some breathtaking action sequences. Overall, War for the Planet of the Apes is a great amazing film. It ties the trilogy up well in a high emotional note. The visual effects and the performances are great. The action sequences are exciting. The plot is epic with Caesar and his journey to saving his apes. I definitely recommend to see the film if you seen the others or not.",War for the Planet of the Apes
44,Floated2,Visually stunning but somewhat lacking,6,7 November 2021,"After rewatching the previous films of this 2010's Planet of the Apes franchise and now seeing War for the Planet of the Apes for the first time, can conclude that enjoyed both previous films than this film. War is longer in runtime and the story doesn't quite feel as engaging, although the graphics, special effects and overall visuals are better than ever.The story drags on slightly, the pace feels slower and the tone here is more serious and depressing than the previous two instalments. Most of the film features the apes bring prisoned by the military soldiers and having them as slave workers. The apes are the primary focus with lesser focus on the humans. Woody Harrelson's Colonel is the lead human portraying the villain yet comes off as somewhat forced. Other than him, the other main human is a little mute girl whom becomes aided by the apes (primarily Maurice- orange orangutan).Featuring a sad ending, it seems this was a solid conclusion to the franchise. Although there were rumours of a sequel to War, it is now going on 5 years and perhaps it is best that War was the final film of the franchise.",War for the Planet of the Apes
45,eddie_baggins,A fitting finale to this furry franchise,8,27 July 2017,"Not even the most optimistic of Ape's fans would've ever dreamed that this trilogy of films, set in the universe that began with the 1968 Charlton Heston classic and was seemingly doomed by the misguided Tim Burton blockbuster of 2001, would've ever been this consistently fantastic.Starting out with Rupert Wyatt's better than it had any right to be Rise in 2011 and built upon by Cloverfield and upcoming Batman director Matt Reeve's larger scale commercial smash Dawn in 2014, War for the Planet of the Apes brings the journey of Andy Serkis's wise ape leader Caesar full circle with another visually stunning and very much above-average summer blockbuster narrative.It's a credit to all involved that War lives up to the standards set by its predecessors and for any fans of the recent Ape entries, there's little doubt that this film will be considered just as good if not better than those that have come before it.War director Reeves has quickly set himself up as a filmmaker of note, from Cloverfield's mysterious beginning's, the underrated Let Me In and the deservedly praised Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and this big budgeted effort further establishes his talent in crafting strong characters around some stunningly conceived visual spectacles.Filled with the emotional nuance and deeper than to be expected themes that have elevated the recent Ape's entries, War wastes very little time in building itself as another higher level blockbuster as we're thrown into an exhilarating forest stanza between man and ape that culminates into some big decisions for Caesar and his loyal tribe of followers, that will eventually see Reeve's turn War into a true battle of the species as Caesar comes face to face with Woody Harrelson's crazed Colonel Kurtz like army head.The narrative that takes place here further allows Andy Serkis to work his motion-capture magic with Caesar in a performance that really should be considered for end of year awards recognition.Its faultless work by the beloved actor, who doesn't put a foot wrong in his turn that his now honed over the 3 films and Caesar remains a likable and inspirational leader for these stories that have been able to leapfrog off Serkis's immaculate work.It must be noted that all motion capture performers, of which includes the likes of Steve Zahn and Judy Greer, are all on top form here as is the CGI work of Weta, who have once more set the bar higher for what we can expect in concerns to this type of film magic.In an age where CGI is becoming less of a spectacle with over stylised and increasingly cluttered events, Apes is often jaw dropping in its realistic depiction of its furry stars and makes an impressive case as to why you should see this film on the big screen.While there's so much to like with Reeves and his teams film, not everything in War comes up trumps in a way that would've made it almost the perfect example of an unmissable blockbuster event.Woody Harrelson, whilst perfectly suited to this type of deranged creation and clearly relishing the limelight, is one of the films let downs with a character that feels like his constantly going to get his real ""game-changing"" moment but The Colonel never really reaches his full potential despite Harrelson's best efforts. Scenes shared with Caesar or The Colonel shaving his head while addressing a crowd of adoring ape-killing soldiers showcase just what might've been had Harrelson been given a little more to do and it feels like a missed opportunity to allow Caesar to truly go head to head with a human adversary worthy of his stature.The other slight disappointment for Reeves film is for a movie that begins its title with the word ""War"" it feels as though we've been a little slight changed by a film that without going into full spoiler territory feels light on for actual warfare and like Harrelson's creation, its arguable that Reeves missed an opportunity to deliver on the full arsenal at his disposal and for those seeking full-blown apes vs human mayhem, you'll leave War feeling relatively underwhelmed.Final Say – With this often brilliant film being the supposed finish to this series, there's now 3 films worth of sufficient evidence to suggest that this trilogy should be regarded alongside the very best of our adored franchises. While War for the Planet of the Apes may let us down a little bit with the ""war"" aspect of proceedings, there's so much else to like in the film and with Serkis and his ape army as good as they've ever been, Reeve's film is one of 2017's must-see big screen events and a fitting culmination for this series as it stands today.4 pairs of unnecessarily worn sunglasses out of 5",War for the Planet of the Apes
46,leonblackwood,Worth a watch!,7,10 January 2018,"Review:
Although this movie doesn't have as much action as the previous Ape films in this franchise, it's still an entertaining film, which shows the relationship between Ape and man, from an Apes point of view. Since the last movie, the Apes are constantly being attacked by the humans, and Caesar, the leader of the Apes, seeks a new home so they can live in peace. When Caesar's son returns from being on the run for some time, he tells him about a secluded desert which will keep the Apes away from the evil Colonel, played by Woody Harrelson but while they are planning there journey, there home is attacked and Caesar seeks revenge after losing close family members. He tells the rest of the Apes to make there way to the desert while he hunts down the colonel, with the help of a couple of his friends. When they finally reach the colonels base, he sees that the rest of the Apes have been captured and used as slaves, and they soon realise that there only way of survival is to escape from the evil Colonel and his army. Visually, this movie was amazing and the plot was intense throughout. The little girl Nova (Amiah Miller) and Bad Ape, voiced by Steve Zahn, we're excellent additions to the cast, along with the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) who was completely nuts but as it was mostly shot from the Apes point of view, it did seem a bit slow in parts and I didn't understand why Caesar didn't talk Ape like the rest of them. The ending was quite emotional and the attention to detail was great but I personally didn't think that it needed to be over 2 hours long. Although I found this movie entertaining, I wouldn't rush to see it again, now that I know the outcome but it's still worth a watch. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Matt Reeves, 51, who also brought you Future Shock in 1994, The Pallbearer, Cloverfield, Let Me In and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2014. He's currently directing the new Batman movie starring Ben Affleck, called, weirdly enough, The Batman. Affleck is also writing the movie, so I'm hoping that it will be better than the previous movies in this reboot. As there isn't any other movies in the Apes franchise planned, I can't help feeling slightly disappointed with this reboot, mainly because it didn't make a huge impact like the original movies but they still were a decent attempt, using today's technology. Andy Serkis really did make Caesar seem real in all of the movies, especially with his movements and face expressions but there wasn't any moments that will make cinematic history, which is a shame because I was quite excited to see how the whole Caesar storyline was was going to pan out. Budget: $150million

47,TheMovieDiorama,War for the Planet of the Apes has restored my faith in 2017.,10,9 March 2018,"Just when I thought no blockbuster would be worthy of a perfect rating, this beauty comes along and proves me wrong. Oh. My. Word. This was absolutely phenomenal. Flawless in terms of the summer blockbuster season. A damn masterpiece in conveying conflict in both war and within one's self. A defining film that will change motion capture imagery for the future (Avatar may have just lost its crown). An action spectacle that knows how to balance explosions with thought-provoking themes and dialogue. A finale that ends a fantastic trilogy (that really we didn't deserve) and cements it as one of the best trilogies of all time. Another reason to love Andy Serkis even more due to his captivating lead performance and consistent hard work on and off screen. So much grit and realism that you'll be questioning to yourself halfway through: ""...hang on, these are CGI apes right?"" as your mind melts and becomes entranced by the sheer perfection of every piece of fur that's visible to human eye as it blows gently in the snowy winds!! So. Much. Emotion. I teared not once, not twice, but three damn times. It's relentless, the waves of emotion just kept crashing down on me...and yet I didn't want to escape. I've grown attached to these complex emotive characters for three films, every chapter felt like getting to know them. The beauty of it is, that the dialogue is minimal...is all in their eyes! So many scenes where the Apes look directly into the camera...into my soul! The human girl added a much needed symbol to the plot: innocence. The dialogue between Harrelson's ""Colonel"" and Caesar was palpable, a five minute scene just of raw powerful dialogue. Bad Ape was a much required lighthearted character who brings some smiles because this film is relentlessly depressing, I warn you now, your soul will be drained of all emotions. But my God what a journey, no regrets whatsoever. Without a doubt, War for the Planet of the Apes gets the perfect rating.",War for the Planet of the Apes
48,Tweetienator,Only a Dead Ape is a Good Ape,2,1 October 2017,"I was never a fan of the new versions - imo the first Planet of the Apes from 1968 with Charlton Heston is way better than the new ones altogether. The first one of the new movies was okay, but this last one is just bad.On top the guy responsible for that bad kitsch soundtrack should be banned from making any kind of music for a movie ever ;) Some scenes spiced with that cheesy music - I really had a good laugh, but I think there was some other emotional reaction from the audience intended or the ""drums"" as Woody hit first time the screen, jeez, really bad stuff it is. And the piano plong plong, really, mostly a not so good soundtrack at least doesn't disturb me, but this is an exceptional example of kitsch. If I ever get caught by whatever mad-hatter and tortured with that soundtrack I will be dead within the hour :DSumma summarum: you get a lot of apes, standard CGI-action, and a plot that could be the script for some C-Western from the 50s.This and last year Hollywood's output mostly really sucks - one by one bad or mediocre movies are released: even big franchises (Tarzan, King Kong, Apes, King Arthur, Transformers etc.) or big actors can't save or disguise the fact that most of the stories told are just bad and ueber-generic stuff, in comparison even the cheap stories published in the good old pulp magazines read like the writings of Satre or Kafka himself.",War for the Planet of the Apes

50,SAMTHEBESTEST,Slow paced but yet another good film from the franchise.,7,14 July 2017,"WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES REVIEW : I have seen previous 2 parts of this franchise and loved them So expectations from this one were not much high but somewhere inside i was expecting a good film. After watching the film i can say i'm not fully satisfied, critics rating were extremely high for this film and i highly disagree with their ratings. It's very slow paced with less action and entertainment, more curved towards building a story but somehow lost the base.Film starts on a very slow note, soldiers vs apes fight, gun shooting scenes were good but film has very useless scenes which could've been removed to make film more pacy. Some minuses are also there, such as Ceaser speaking to Men in human language is OK but he speaks in human language with apes too? I mean what is this? How could all apes understand human language? Colonel's death scene could have been better and Ceaser's death scene in Climax wasn't needed. Except these minuses and despite slow pace i must say War For The Planet Of The Apes is yet Another Good film in the franchise.Story is good, has some logical things. Screenplay is Average, could've easily been much much better. Cinematography is Excellent, probably best thing about the film. I didn't see any 3D effects in film then what is the use of releasing film in 3D, no need to watch this film in 3D, go for 2D and get rid of bother of arranging 3D glasses in theater. Background Score is Kick-ass, i just loved it. Direction is Good and i'm fairly satisfied with the Director because i can't expect a better film with this screenplay.Overall, War For The Planet Of The Apes is almost a Terrific film but fails short to the mark so i can't strongly recommend this film. Less entertaining value hurts otherwise it has everything you expect from the franchise. I personally think there should be no sequels to this film, i mean come on, people won't accept Apes's emotional stories every time, you have to stop somewhere and i think this is the right time. 3 good films is a good time to end the franchise. Anyways that's makers call not mine, so just go and watch this film If you are fan of this franchise otherwise save the money for upcoming Blockbusters. I'm giving 7/10* stars, 1 star extra for Direction and overall impact of the film.",War for the Planet of the Apes
51,matthewssilverhammer,Monkeys Make Movie Masterpiece,9,20 July 2017,"After the slow-burn drama of Rise and the dystopian adventure of Dawn, War is a sci-fi-war-western for the ages. With a world even more segregated, the ape community seeks justice with a new foe, but there's more to this than just pure vengeance. This continues the empathetic story of Caesar, who, when his heart breaks, so does ours; and who, when his blood boils, so does ours. Technically, it's staggering. Reeves has crafted War like a perfectly melancholic song, knowing just when to throw in a major chord or tonal uplift (the delightful new ape) to counterbalance without abandoning the soulful heartache. The CG is impossibly amazing, and the action sequences and scenic shots are so far beyond the norm for a Hollywood spectacle; full of artistic intent and skill, it's more comparable to a John Ford film than a modern superhero outing. And the score is beyond phenomenal. Haunting, sweet, intense; it beautifully plays with the same tones, themes and instruments as the experimental score for the groundbreaking '60s original. At its heart, War is refreshingly thoughtful. Delusions of grandeur, fearing the ""other"", conspiracy theories, slavery, suicide, nature wiping out humanity; this franchise is no stranger to the heavier points of storytelling. Thankfully, such intense empathy has been created for Caesar and his simian brethren in this unexpectedly poignant and fantastic franchise, that we allow (and even long) for its intense honesty. And look, there's a straight-up glut of great stuff in theatres. If you want some light fun full of mirth and mayhem, by all means, see Spider-Man. However, if you wanna be dramatically immersed in a world of emotive power and visual depth, see War.",War for the Planet of the Apes
52,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Another very good movie in one of Hollywood's most surprising franchises,8,25 December 2017,"In terms of big-budget blockbusters, the rebooted ""Planet of the Apes"" series has to be the most pleasant surprise of the decade. No one expected 2011's ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" to be any good, let alone for 20th Century Fox to churn out three commercial and critical successes. Yet that's exactly what they've done. ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" serves as a fitting conclusion (or penultimate edition, or wherever it ends up in the order of these movies) that builds upon the best qualities of its predecessors. The fallout from 2014's ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" sees Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his tribe in hiding, only they've been tracked down by an army of humans (and a few rogue apes) led by the malicious Col. McCullough (Woody Harrelson), who refuses Caesar's gesture of peace when he and his men infiltrate the apes' hideout and leave casualties. The apes must leave their home and a furious Caesar -joined by friends Maurice (Karin Konoval), Rocket (Terry Notary) and Luca (Michael Adamthwaite) - begins a quest to track down McCullough and his army.Serkis remains brilliant as Caesar, one of the most well-written and properly tended to protagonists in any blockbuster franchise today. The series has thoughtfully charted his journey from revolutionary to leader; ""War"" tests the extent of his heroism and pushes him to his emotional limits. A big part of his personal story involves feeling haunted by Koba, the ape who betrayed him in ""Dawn."" That film was more about whether humans and apes have the capacity to make peace and recognizing the good and bad on both sides; ""War"" sees both sides confronting ""the other"" in themselves.Director Matt Reeves and writer Mark Bomback return for ""War"" and the continuity with ""Dawn"" is apparent. They know exactly why the first two films connected with audiences, and even though the story of this film lacks the same compelling, deeply complex tension, they remain focused on the characters and their inner struggles. The bottom line: they spend the time to make us invested in these characters that the story will work no matter what plot points they throw at them.Of course that connection wouldn't be anywhere near as deep without the team at Weta Digital breathing such intense realism into the apes and the world-class motion-capture actors who bridge that realism with sincere human emotion. When you witness some of the apes' powerful facial expressions and get consequently drawn deeper into the story, it's easy to forget how without complete commitment and attention to detail, making a movie with apes as main characters could have just as easily been distracting and laughable. That these films have delivered the exact opposite is movie magic at its finest. That human characters have become less and less essential to each successive movie ranks high among the series' most remarkable achievements.As ""blockbuster"" movies with the word ""War"" in the title go, the film goes pretty light on action. The action takes a back seat to the aforementioned character development. Still, ""War"" has plenty of stunning visuals and Reeves finds a way to make the big action sequences count, at least in terms of being interesting to look at; not so much in terms of doing a lot of riveting storytelling through action. Fans expecting this to be the biggest of the three films will undoubtedly be a little disappointed compared to ""Dawn,"" but anyone who has been taken by the storytelling and visual craftsmanship that went into the first two films will get swept up by ""War,"" even if to a lesser degree. We're a few years a way from putting a cap on the 2010s, but in a decade teeming with superhero sequels that also included the return of ""Star Wars"" to the big screen, the ""Apes"" films will likely be forgotten or remain underrated. They shouldn't be. Considering there was no huge pre-established fanbase eager to consume them, they stand as a shining example of intelligent blockbusters - and what big studio films can be. If they try a fourth time and succeed, they will be nothing short of an unprecedented miracle.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",War for the Planet of the Apes

54,paul-allaer,Ape-pocalypse Now,7,16 July 2017,"""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (2017 release; 140 min.) continues the story of ape commander-in-chief Caesar and his fellow apes. As the movie opens, we are briefly reminded of the context of the previous ""Rise"" and ""Dawn"" movies, and we learn that Caesar and his troops have been evading the humans by hiding deep in the woods for the last two years. But that changes quickly as the US Army finds them, and initiates battle, only to be overrun by the apes. A handful of soldiers are caught, but rather than killing them, Caesar decides to set them free, with the message ""Leave us alone in the woods and the killing will stop"". Alas, that is not to be... At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the concluding chapter of the franchise reboot that started"" with ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". Once gain writer-director Matt Reeves is at the helm. The movie's title as well as the movie's trailer give the impression that this is an all-out action movie, and while there is certainly plenty of action, the movie is in fact more of a character study of the apes, and of Caesar in particular. The apes interact with a subtlety and nuance that we have never seen before. Check the facial expression of Caesar (played brilliantly by Andy Serkis--give this man an Oscar nomination already!). Beware: this is one heavy duty movie. There are some moments of much needed lightness and humor, primarily resulting from the funny ""Bad Ape"" character (played by Steve Zahn), an erstwhile Sienna zoo chimp. Woody Harrelson plays arch-baddie The Colonel, who reminded me immediately of Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz character in Apocalypse Now. Speaking of which, at one point in the movie, we see an underground tunnel spray-painted ""Ape-pocalypse this way ------->"", and that just about sums it up. As good as the movie is, it does suffer in my opinion from an overly long running time. Tighter editing could've easily trimmed this by 15-20 min. without losing any of its essence. And just when you think you've seen it all, then comes the haunting final scenes of the movie. Wow.""War for the Planet of the Apes"" opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely (but not quite a sell-out). Given the excellent word of mouth this movie surely will generate, I can see this playing in theaters for quite a while, even with all of the other summer big budget movies competing for our attention. If you liked the ""Rise"" and ""Dawn"" installments of the ""Planet of the Apes"" reboot, you surely will love the ""War"" installment. ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",War for the Planet of the Apes
55,subxerogravity,A great movie that will help this Planet of the Apes reboot to become a classic Trilogy,9,15 July 2017,"With this third installment, this makes for the best remake of an entire franchise that I ever scene. I've seen movies that are remakes that are better than the original, but it's amazing how this set of ape movies are right up there with the original(Although in Fairness, this set of movies is actually a prequel to the originals) The musical score that pays homage to the old school 1970s Planet of the Apes is proof that they were trying and succeeded in passing the originals (By giving you a powerful essence of the original, possibly setting up the idea that these movies are catching up with the first set). It was a great Sci-Fi Fantasy adventure. A little different from the past two as War for the planet of the Apes focus on the apes more and their adventure form their point of view. The events from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes resulted in the last of the US Military service headed up by Woody Harrison, doing a great Marlon Brando from Apocalypse Now impersonation, attempting to kill the apes who threaten men's place in evolution.The biggest advantage of the new Apes movie versus the old is technology. Technology that allows the apes to be more realistic with Stop motion capturing and Andy Serkis was holding it down, proving what an amazing actor he can be behind the CGI. I can't remember any other movie in which the CGI characters were able to make me feel for them like they did in this one. Each ape perfectly has a personality of their own. 2017 is turning out to be a decent year for large budget films and War for the Planet of the Apes is on the list as one of those.http://cinemagardens.com",War for the Planet of the Apes
56,RodrigAndrisan,Impressive!,8,10 January 2018,"Well, it's not a masterpiece but is has many exciting moments, made in spite of those facial masks, what many actors in maskless normal movies do not succeed. I think Pierre Boulle would be impressed too with what Hollywood still pulls out of his original work. Andy Serkis and Steve Zahn have two very good roles. Woody Harrelson is not bad but I've seen him play much better in many other movies. All those special ape suits and special masks are very well done. So are the decors and special effects. Music is sad as the whole movie. We have come to be on the side of the monkeys, not of the humans... That's the most sad! Nine out of ten other reviews (I can't read them all when there are hundreds...), they say only bad things. The general level of the audience is very low, too low, people are so stupid, they have not understood anything from this movie and from thousands and thousands of other movies.

57,billcr12,The Apes are back,8,26 October 2017,"Woody Harrelson is the Colonel, and he channels Brando's Kurtz from Apocalypse Now,as he has gone off the deep end. After killing Caesar' wife and son, the lead ape is on a mission to settle the score, much like an old Clint Eastwood spaghetti western. Again, as with the previous ape film from 2014, it is much too long at two hours and twenty minutes. Does anyone know the meaning of the word editing? Otherwise, it is the classic battle of good versus evil between Caesar and the colonel. Woody is great, as usual, and Andy Serkis reprises his role from the last Ape movie, and he again equal to the task. The visuals are stunning, and the action non stop. Other than the aforementioned length of the film, if you have some time to kill this is one entertaining ape fest.",War for the Planet of the Apes
58,jamesrupert2014,Pretty good CGI-fest with a misleading title,8,26 February 2018,"I liked this installment in the latest 'Planet of the Apes' series more than the previous two (neither of which impressed me). The rendering of the apes is outstanding (as is their 'acting') and the rest of the CGI (e.g. the battle scenes) are fine, albeit typical for the budget. The story is a simple revenge quest overlaying the core ""Planet of the Apes"" story arc and essentially closes setting up the world on which Taylor (Charlton Heston) and crew will crash-land centuries in the future (as depicted in the original 1968 ""Planet of the Apes""). Anyone expecting an all out clash between an ape army and the remnants of humanity will be disappointed by the climax*, which (IMO) is the weakest part of the film, both from the perspective of the plot and in execution. While I liked the story and the characters overall (even the Gollum-oid 'Bad Ape'), the plot depended on coincidences and a lot of luck on behalf of the apes (e.g. the human guards are notably unobservant at times);and, while the motives behind the 'Colonel McCollough' character were clever (esp. in relation to the overall POTA-verse), I felt that the character was played too much as the standard over-the-top, neo-fascist, super-villain. As a side note: while I liked the nods to the original movie, I found the names 'Nova' and 'Cornelius' confusing (and annoying) as I initially assumed that they were supposed to be the 'actual' Nova and Cornelius - suggesting that the events in the 1968 film were only a decade or two in the future of this film (which was ridiculous but not outside of the scope of Hollywood revisionism). Overall, ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is worth watching as a story in its own right, as a solid and 'key' entry in the ""Planet of the Apes"" reality-stream, and as a demonstration of top-flight CGI (both in imagery and in 'acting'). *an option is to watch 1974's less-than-stellar ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes""",War for the Planet of the Apes

And while some ape comrades join Caeser on his path, Caeser wonders will he become has bad as the colonial.Andy Serkis really gives another good as Caeser, a very good motion capture performance. Woody Harrelson also steals some scenes has the bad guy, when you look into his eyes you really see madness, but there is one scene where his character explains why he does what he does, and that I believe should get Harrelson an Oscar nomination, cause he was so riveting. At times the movie feels like a two part, one part revenge drama, and second part escape drama. The other actors in motion capture suits also do well when acting has smart apes. I feel the ending really sets up for the 1968 film starring Charlton Heston.",War for the Planet of the Apes

And FYI, I have already heard that a fourth is in the works so all you Ape fans can rejoice. This one starts with the simian flu that spread across the world is now changing both apes and humans-that is, the ones that it didn't outright kill. Apes are getting smarter and humans are getting .... well, dumber. Andy/Caesar is talking as if he were completely human and I must mention that the motion capture here is pretty amazing. Some of the apes talk in broken English and some use sign language but they are all in the midst of evolving. Woody plays the human colonel that is hell bent on exterminating all apes, and he does a fine job as a villain that you really dislike. Steve plays a liberated zoo ape that helps Andy and Amiah plays an orphaned human girl that is adopted by the apes. Andy just wants to live in peace with the humans but Woody just can't go along with the program-he has his own personal reasons. There are some apes working for the humans-that are hunting Andy and any other apes-and they are called 'Donkeys', as in they are labor animals. There are characters and other connections linked to the original 1968 Planet of the Apes movie that you should catch, if you have seen the original- remember, these three movies take place before and lead up to the 1968 original. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi violence and action and some disturbing images and has a running time of 2 hours & 22 minutes. I think it's a great entry in the franchise and I would buy it on DVD.",War for the Planet of the Apes

The war I am referring to is the final chapter of the prequel series of the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise entitled ""War for the Planet of the Apes"". In this chapter, Ape Leader Caesar is on a vengeance quest against a domineering Colonel who uses the Apes for slavery, but there is more on why Caesar wants the Colonel fried as Colonel Sanders. Writer- Director Mark Reeves does orchestrate ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" quite admirably, even though I did go a tad ""ape crazy"" with a few scenes that could have been shortened. The film's cinematography, production design, and score were fabulous; and so was the performance capture extraordinaire work from Andy Serkis as Ceasar. The Serkis show of phenomenal performance capture efforts continues for Andy. Even though Woody Harrelson was just being Woody as the Colonel, he still delivered Wood strong once more.

63,alindsay-al,A fantastic fitting end to this amazing trilogy,9,12 July 2017,"I absolutely love both rise and dawn of the planet of the apes so this film had so much anticipation for me and I have now seen war for the planet of the apes and I loved it. The premise of the film sees the apes led by caeser attempting to survive against a human colonel and his legions. Andy serkis is back as caeser and my goodness he is flawless in this film, the CGI looks so real and this film truly focuses on him and he carries this movie. His emotional journey throughout the film is amazing to watch and I cared about him more then most humans in any film. Woody harrelson plays the colonel in this film and this is the best I have seen from him in a long time, even though he is the villain in this film his performance is so compelling that similar to Gary oldman's character in the last film you kind of understand why he takes the actions that he does. This film is an ape centric film and all the performances are great, the character of Maurice is given a lot more to do in this film and provides a lot of emotion throughout the film. Steve zahn plays bad ape in this film who provides a great sense of comic relief that really works for this film and I really appreciated the character in this film. There is a little girl in this film and I really enjoyed seeing her relationship with all the apes develop throughout the film to make you care about her. The story has really good development of the apes and there society and i loved the contrast with harrelson and his group. But I found the last act to be a bit jumbled, they introduce new factors to the story and I just didn't care about it as much as I should have been. The script is great, the drama all delivered and helped to make me care about the characters in the film. Also as mentioned before this film does a really good job with it's humour to help balance out the film. The style of the film is pretty dark and serious that really works, the action scenes all really work with the cgi for the apes looking truly amazing.

It's got the trappings of a war film, and there's some conflict, but anyone expecting factions of apes and humans frothing at the mouth and charging toward one another in a last desperate battle for supremacy are going to be sorely disappointed.With a glacial pace, one dimensional characters and ham-fisted drama, War utterly wastes its impressive technical merits.

66,jimbo-53-186511,The Ape Escape,7,22 July 2017,"Several years after the events of the last film, a colonel (Woody Harrelson) and his soldiers are still hell-bent on destroying every single ape on the planet - despite the fact that many other humans have been able to co-exist with the apes. In order to show that not all apes are evil, Caesar spares the lives of two of the colonel's men and tells them to inform the colonel that they want the war to end. However, the colonel refuses to back down and when his wife and son are killed at the hands of the colonel, Caesar makes it his mission to kill the colonel...As with the previous entries in this franchise, War For The Planet Of The Apes is a beautifully photographed and very well put together film. In its entirety, it is also a very intelligent and thought-provoking franchise - despite each film suffers some slips from time to time.Where this film succeeds once again is in its ability to make its audience care about what is happening; at the start of the film, Caesar is reunited with his son, but this happy reunion is short-lived when Caesar's son (and wife) are killed by the colonel. This tragic incident automatically got me behind Caesar and had me willing him on to get his revenge against the colonel. From this point forward, the film does slow down somewhat as we follow Caesar's journey to track down the colonel. I have to admit that the middle portion of the film is somewhat sluggish (particularly following the impressive opening sequences), but it never lost me and I never felt bored at any point during the running time.I think one of the key moments in this film is the scene where the colonel and Caesar are talking shortly after Caesar has been captured. Up till this point, the colonel hadn't had much development and his motivations for wanting to destroy all of the apes was unclear, but after he explains about what happened to his son and what he had to do to his son it all becomes very clear. This one scene reminded me of how intelligent this franchise is as a whole and this small slice of character development helped me to gain an understanding of the colonel and at the very least I learned why he wanted to destroy the apes.Although it is slow in the first half, WFTPOTA does come good in its second half when we essentially witness Caesar being captured and a carefully co-ordinated plan is orchestrated in order to free him and his fellow apes. This portion of the film was exciting and fun to watch and the idea of counting how many steps it was to each prison chamber was a nice touch. In fact, this part of the film reminded me a bit of The Great Escape, but this was probably in part down to the fact that the colonel ran the place like some sort of Ape concentration camp (which I suppose it was).Other good touches to this film lay with Bad Ape who proved to be a fun addition to the franchise. It was funny seeing the only ape (other than Caesar) who can talk which makes one assume he is intelligent only to subvert this slightly by showing him to be an ape with literally no common sense - I thought this was a nice touch.Aside from a slightly laborious first half, the only other weak link with this film lay with the inclusion of the little girl; she was given no real development and we didn't even find out who her parents were? Was the guy that Caesar killed her father? Because she wasn't developed she acted as little more than unnecessary baggage and served no real purpose in the story. The only thing I got from her involvement was that she was living proof of what the colonel was talking about when he mentioned that his son devolved, lost his ability to speak and became primitive and I couldn't help but feeling that she was only there to remind us of these things.It has some shortcomings, but with its gorgeous visuals, rich storytelling, impressive battle sequences, and an antagonist who is, at least, interesting, and given some development it boasts enough strengths to entertain the masses (particularly those that enjoyed the first two films)",War for the Planet of the Apes

I have, and here are my thoughts: I am conflicted between admiring the CGI and absolute lifelike imagery of the apes, and particularly Andy Serkis as Caesar, as well as the astonishing amazing war-torn-storybook 'look' and then, I am irritated with the obvious re-use of CGI from other films. I constantly had the uneasy feeling I was seeing retread CGI from other movies: this came obvious when they discover a monkey which clearly is Dobby from the Harry Potter films. The thunderous waterfall and fir forests from Disney's JUNGKE BOOK and PETES DRAGON, ....FURY ROAD and the ridiculous recent PAN got a look in with convoys of trucks and the tunnel and fortress from any angle, and it all lapsed into THE GREAT ESCAPE and PAPILLON, eventually. Even a Dr ZHIVAGO citadel room. Then we get a mashup of WIZARD OF OZ Castle of the Witch where the trio and Dorothy hide among the rocks overlooking, this time with a trio of different apes and a little girl, even the Ourang- outang is the friendly Lion; and APOCALYPSE NOW with it's Colonel Kurt imagery throughout and mountain fortress and army. It is a familiar jigsaw puzzle of clever re used imagery heightened with astonishing visual skill which makes it compelling for a few seconds, then you feel irritated that you feel you know where they got the ideas from. It is an amazing result but it betrays itself. I loved some of the obvious studio sets and back projection, and marveled at the Apes few and many... The Dobby Monkey really unraveled it.

He still considers murder an abominable act and preaches for peaceful solutions. Let us live in peace and everything should be fine. Well, not everything is going the way he wants. His family is murdered by an unstable and vengeful colonel who wants to exterminate the apes and carryout his plans for revenge.Caesar's tragedy propels him to find the colonel and seek justice.

Whoever hasn't been killed by the virus is now regressing into different types of humanoids. It's affecting their speech and mental capacities. This becomes an essential plot development that explains what is going on with the colonel.Humans are for the most part portrayed as cruel assassins, with a collective desire to destroy life. The scenes in the base recall concentration camp mentality, and the final battles are portrayed in such a way that we know nothing good will come out of it. Nature is beginning to settle the conflict, and it might end up playing an important part in the film's climax.Much of the success is Andy Serkis' amazing turn as Caesar. He keeps getting better and better, giving us access to the turmoil and the variety of feelings he experiences throughout the film. Intelligence, grief, anger, surprise are clearly shown, and we soon forget that we CGI is even a part of the equation.The film has an epic film, with gorgeous vistas shown in the different parts of the journey. Emotions are highlighted by the use of light and how the camera focuses on everything, the faces, and the background. It's a beautiful way to tell a story, and as you will have experienced by the film's conclusion, and to reach an audience by touching their hearts.",War for the Planet of the Apes
70,adamjohns-42575,Monkey Business!,8,23 May 2021,"A perfectly satisfactory way to end an enjoyable trilogy. It would have been easy to go all guns blazing and have a massive war between Humans and Apes worldwide with huge explosions and ridiculous death tolls on either side, but they cleverly kept it all very focused in San Francisco where the story originated and we are still unclear how the rest of the world faired against the ""Simian Flu"".The characters are all well formed having largely been in the series from the beginning and I loved to see Maurice's role grow. I also adored the addition of Bad Ape, a great performance by Steve Zahn and not what I was expecting from him at all.The CGI in this one has already vastly improved since the first of the trilogy and the apes are almost completely realistic.I'm sure there are people out there who have never seen or even heard of the original 'Planet Of The Apes' films or even the Mark Wahlberg version, so many will be surprised by the ending, but I think the majority of us all knew how it would go down for the most part. I would still like to know how Lady Liberty ends up covered in sand on a beach, but it's not something I will lose sleep over.Although I can't stand Charlton, I am tempted to try and watch the original films all the way through and I would certainly like to read the book, because these three films have sparked my interest in the larger ape world.",War for the Planet of the Apes
71,AudioFileZ,Better Than All The Hate Reviews It Would Seem,6,4 December 2017,"So many thought this should be an epic battle and didn't get it? Obviously that has fueled so much of the negative reviews. What did they expect? Two hours of the first battle which is good, by the way? How would that make a far better film?What we get is the most elaborate CGI in the franchise with a kind of mutated evolution story. It's not like war doesn't bring out some of the worst of humanity. That's nothing to just dismiss. So, we get a fair story of the apes led by Ceasar attempting to balance their own hate and distrust of the remaining humans who still just won't leave them be. Or at least a sizable rogue group of humans are out for blood. True, it's rather simplistic, but think how often interfering using war backfires. It's kind of like ignoring history and blindly attempting to create something that will never be. So, instead of being insulted by the story I say just roll with it. I mean the apes are at the dawning here of mutant bit of humanity where they're just saying leave us be and we'll do the same. When neither side can outright win maybe that's the solution even if the humans take longer to get on board. I guess turning a mirror on some of this old thinking hits people the wrong way when it's grafted onto a sacred movie franchise? This movie isn't trying to make a social statement though because it's just entertainment. Just a story which to some because it's Planet of the Apes is a let down. Get over it.If you're looking for constant violent action scenes I know where you stand. If you're looking for fantastic CGI with some action and an OK story you'll be able to say it's a pretty good flick.",War for the Planet of the Apes

When Caesar and the apes are captured by the Colonel, and are forced into labor with hardly rest, food, or water. As once again liberal Hollywood portrays the US Army as the villains and heartless killing machines and slave masters. Not the first nor will be the last time that happened.

Still a great movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes
73,davidmvining,Apes find the right ending,8,8 September 2020,"The renewed Apes franchise comes to a conclusive end (while keeping things open for further sequels that are currently in development) with a trilogy capper that intelligently explores the fallout from the previous film for the main character. Matt Reeves follows up one of the best big budget special effects driven films of the last decade with a very good film that understands where the central character needs to go next.It's been several years since the events of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and Caesar has been running a guerilla war against the remnants of the US military at his heels. The movie begins with a pitched battle as the military finds the ape refuge and attacks only to get defeated soundly. Caesar has hardened since the war started, but he's still grasping onto his morality, manifested by him letting the few survivors go back to their colonel with a message that the war could end if the humans would simply leave them alone. That, of course, does not come to pass. Instead, the colonel brings in a special ops force to sneak in at night and assassinate Caesar in his sleep, killing Caesar's wife and eldest son instead. This does to Caesar what Koba had wanted from him before his death. Koba saw nothing good in humanity, and now, having felt the terrors of war firsthand and personally, Caesar falls into what Koba had wanted before his death.The new film intelligently keeps Koba around, not as a primary antagonist, but as a ghost who haunts Caesar. The defeat of Koba himself doesn't defeat Koba's ideology. That's something that Caesar must continue to fight long after Koba himself has died. At the death of two members of his family, Caesar falls instantly into that, abandoning the ideological fight that he had won, and seeing nothing but the innate evil of humanity. He sets out on his own (with a few others who refuse to be left behind) to kill the colonel himself while the rest of the herd moves off to find somewhere else to live, their location having been revealed to the humans.Along the way, they pick up a mute girl, and while the girl herself ends up working really well, I feel like her early introduction, right after Caesar has determined that he has become a Koba-like nihilist, is a bit too obvious. Suddenly, Caesar has a little human girl who could never be a real threat to him in his presence right after he picked up his anti-human feelings. Well, yeah, she's going to be one of the primary vessels to get him out of it, why do you ask? They also end up meeting a new ape, one who has no connection to the group but still can speak and has the increased intelligence of the rest, Bad Ape, a former denizen of a zoo who's been barely surviving just outside of humanity's reach and knows of the likely place where the colonel went to.What's interesting about the human characters in this, the third of the rebooted Apes franchise, is that the humans are possibly even more interesting than the apes for the first time. The Colonel is a version of Colonel Kurtz in the movie's most obvious reference to Apocalypse Now. He's a madman who's seen things that his superiors haven't. They don't understand, and, what makes him most interesting, is that he's actually right to a great degree. His effort to destroy the apes isn't driven by hatred, but by a change in the nature of the conflict that Caesar doesn't even realize has happened. The virus that wiped out most of humanity and made the apes smart has mutated and started making humans no more than beasts. It's not a clash of civilizations, it's a fight for humanity's survival, and no one has realized it yet other than him. To add to the character, Woody Harrelson is absolutely electric as The Colonel. He's quiet, intelligent, zealous in his belief, and cruel all at once. His scenes with Caesar are the absolute height of the film as Caesar steadily gets to know the man he wants to kill.Caesar's hatred, though, gets balanced with the fact that The Colonel found the herd and captured them, forcing them to build a wall at the abandoned weapons depot. He can't simply act on his own emotions despite moving in ways designed to separate himself from responsibility. Instead he finds himself grounded by his own people, no matter what he tries. He can't completely descend into Koba's viewpoint. He still has a small son to worry about.It comes down to the conflict between The Colonel, who's taking a by any means necessary approach to a fight he knows he losing, and Caesar, who was willing to take a similar approach in a fight he had thought he had already lost, that is the center of the film. Perhaps the best scene is when the conflict comes to an end, and Caesar cannot take his vengeance anymore. It's a mixture of pity, anger, and relief that goes across Caesar's perfectly rendered digital face, and it shows him a different way forward, one that helps him purge himself of Koba's ghost completely.War for the Planet of the Apes is steeped in the history of the franchise, using elements such as Nova, Charlton Heston's voice, the Alpha and Omega symbols from Beneath the Planet of the Apes, and the human muteness as building blocks in a story about Caesar's final journey into leadership and personhood. It also intelligently uses movies of the past, particularly Apocalypse Now, as inspiration for how to tell this story, going beyond parody and firmly entering homage while standing on its own two feet. I suppose my only small problem is the early use of Nova, though I do appreciate how she gets used later. Still, the movie is a very good final chapter to this new Apes trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes
74,TheOneThatYouWanted,Bad marketing / great movie,10,16 November 2017,"What an epic conclusion to an outstanding series. Shame the marketing campaign did an awful job. Wait, I take that back. It was the title of the film that kept people away. Personally, I didn't watch this in theaters because I thought it was going to be just like the last apes film- which felt like a ""war"" film. Not saying the second apes film wasn't great but we were lead to believe to was going to be the same exact film - which would have been a put off if that was the case. But much to my delight this was an epic odyssey of a film that did not disappoint and helped to put this trilogy as one of the greatest film trilogies of all time. And it ties up all the loose ends perfectly.",War for the Planet of the Apes
75,jadepietro,Going Ape,9,15 May 2018,"GRADE: B+THE FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.JIM'S REVIEW: The Planet of the Apes series has spanned 50 years with a very spotty record of hits and misses. The third chapter in this rebooted trilogy, War for the Planet of the Apes, (totaling 8 remakes, including this 2017 film) is a wonderful offering of strong storytelling, fine acting, astute direction by Matt Reeves, and dazzling state-of-the-arts visuals.The story beleaguers its tale about the battle between man and apes. After all, this is a war movie, regardless of the species, but wisely focuses on the primates and their interplay and conflicts. The film fleshes out their individual traits and humanizes their plight.Andy Serkis once again plays Caesar, the leader of the retreating apes, and supplies voice and action to his character to maximum effect. Woody Harrelson is his blood-thirsty de-humanized adversary, known as The Colonel, a direct descendent of Col. Kurtz from Apocalypse Now. He is seen as pure evil and little time is spent on his character development, one of the film's minor flaws. Also bringing strong support is Steve Zahn as Bad Ape, Karin Konoval as Caesar's loyal friend, and Amiah Miller as the mute Nova.More time is spent on the action packed combat sequences. There is strong evidence of inspiration from other war films such as The Bridge Over the River Kwai, The Great Escape, and that aforementioned Coppola classic. However, the screenplay by Mark Bomback and the director mixes the ""human"" drama with its war scenes most effectively. (Kudos to Mr. Reeves for his strong direction as well which balances the dramatic narrative with epic staging usually found in blockbuster spectacles.)But its the film's Oscar-nominated visual look that champions this sci-fi adventure film. (It should have won.) Without the transfixing motion-capture design and CGI effects created by all the artisans behind the lenses, the film would not have worked so incredibly well. It is an impressive realistic blending of animation and acting that makes the story resonant. The production values are top-notch, especially taut editing by William Hoy and Stan Salfas and a diverse music score by Michael Giacchino that does not bombard the viewer with loud unnecessary fanfare. The series is bookended with its very best efforts and War for the Planet of the Apes, this franchises' possibly last installment, ranks among its finest achievements.",War for the Planet of the Apes
76,rgkarim,War or Survival Of Planet of The Apes,8,13 July 2017,"Planet of the Apes, a series that has had ups and downs over the decades it's been in existence. The recent remakes have breathed life into the series and delivered some fantastic films that scream science fiction as they explain the events leading to the ""classic"" story. After a grand slam, middle movie that started the war, the third installment promised to bring that battle to full swing (according to the trailers). Robbie K here with another review to fill the details and help guide your viewing choices. Warwhat is it good for? Let's see if we can answer that question. LIKES:The Graphics: The new series forewent the costumes, makeup, and looks of the classic series and instead focused on CGI graphics to bring the apes to life. Once more, this series gets the animation perfect in all the high definition detail that modern technology brings. Andy Serkis (or Smeagle from LOTR for most of you) flexes his motion capture muscles in a stunning performance as Caesar the lead ape. The movements are fluid, the facial gestures on point, and despite being painted as a chimpanzee, manages to brilliantly bring out a human like protagonist you can't help but love. When the more exciting moments are brought in, the border between reality (pyrotechnics) and virtual display is blurred even further in a balanced execution that keeps things in check. Overall, the visual presentation is stunning. The Story: When you are doing prequels, it can be difficult to answer questions, but still craft an original story that is good (see the countless Star Wars prequel discussions). War for the Planet of the Apes manages to achieve this balance of answering questions, while still bringing a story of its own. This film manages to further develop Caesar's life, while integrating key relationships that establish a firm foundation needed for these movies. Much of the film is packed with this deep dive into the character psyche, while trying to infuse tension and suspense at the fates of the other apes. A good story indeed. The Emotion: And what makes the story so good, it's the emotion captured in much of the scenes and sequences in the film. Caesar himself is a complicated mess of feelings, motivations, and morale decisions, which is all brought out in the motion capture animation of Serkis' work. Watching his reactions, as well as the visualization of the war are brilliantly displayed with fantastic cinematography and supporting audio that maximizes the punches/kicks of the moment. Animal activists will get double the slaps, but such emotion kept me engaged in the movie and suspenseful as what would happen next. This may be the best component of the movie for me.DISLIKES:The Length: Another example of editing, War for the Planet of the Apes could have cut some time off the movie. This could have been achieved by shortening some of the suffering scenes, or dropping another sequence itself, though this might have weakened the story at points. For this reviewer, there were components that felt a little long winded and unnecessary, which kind of bored me give the title of the movie (more on this later).The Torture: If seeing characters tortured is your idea of entertainment, then get stoked because this is your movie. War for the Planet of the Apes has many dark moments that show the horrors that war can truly be. The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) is a stereotypical, military antagonist and this movie is not afraid to show off his cruelty in that overinflated manner Hollywood makes famous. Many scenes may be disturbing to those with sensitive constitutions or again animal activist passion. I found myself quite irritated, annoyed, and ticked off at times at seeing these scenes over and over again. While I admit a few of these scenes were needed, there is too much of a ""good"" thing that can lead to it being overdone. The Lack of Action: For a movie called War for the Planet of the Apes, I was expecting more combat to be packed in. The trailers promised scenes of battle between man and ape, with military tactics going up against technologically advanced soldiers. Sadly, this was not the case as this film had only two battle sequences to throw some excitement into the mix. These scenes were cool, but a little anti-climactic and didn't show the bravado I really wanted to see to deliver that exciting bang I craved. Sure, War is not just about the exciting battles made famous in cinema and video games, and this film shows another side to War. If that is going to be the case, don't edit the trailers to promise that. The VERDICT:War for the Planet of the Apes might have been better named survival of the Planet of the Apes. While not the most exciting of the movies and a little darker in regards to portrayal of the Apes' journey, it definitely has the emotional punch of the other installments. It's a beautiful tale that brings the prequels to full closure, while still opening up another movie or two to continue bridging the gap between classic and new. I do agree that it is one of the better movies of the summer, still it needs a little tweaking in the editing and action department to bring it to full life. Worth a trip to the theater? The answer is yes!My scores: Action/Adventure/Drama: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",War for the Planet of the Apes
77,eric262003,Great Way to End the Series,9,25 September 2018,"The last of the the series of ""The Planet of the Apes"" titled ""The War of the Planet of the Apes"" sparked an abundance of positive reviews from the audience. The box office reached the plateau of over $134 million and people were just stunned at the outcome of how the series ended. To me this final installment was the best of the series and if a film wants to wrap up a series this is truly the way to do it.It's great to see Matt Reeves back again in the director's chair plus he has double the duty this time serving as co-writer along with Mike Bomback. It's great that Reeves returns that way we can easily have the series pick up where it left off from the previous installment, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"". In this movie we see the return of Caesar (Andy Serkis) getting his vengeance against the ruthless Colonel (Woody Harrelson) after the pain and heartbreak he caused to his family.Although the plot seems like a story that's been done hundreds of times, Reeves succeeds in taking the efforts to create newer, fresher ideas and avoiding using recycled cliches like other filmmakers do. The epic battle between Caesar and the Colonel has increased in levels of sheer intensity is likely to grab your attention. It's also a great way to side with the simians and truly has characters you could easily side with while having villains you could easily despise.Woody Harrelson is excellent as the villain in this story. From the opening scenes you truly hate this person and you hope that in the end he gets what's coming at him. Harrelson is amazingly versatile in all of his performances, but here he does outdo himself here. Don't expect to see any signs of his likable character on 'Cheers"" anytime.Great addition to the cast is Amiah Miller as the mute girl, Nova (similar traits her predecessor Linda Harrison portrayed in the ""Planet of the Apes"" film in the 1960's and 1970's). She's been caught with the simian epidemic making her almost primitive, but her expression and emotions truly make up for role in which she is mute throughout the whole film. Even though comedy is not a necessity in this movie, it does have some comic relief from Steve Zahn's performance as Bad Ape. At least it feels organic and not rubbed into our faces. It also helps that his backstory is quite provocative to make his character all the more likable.The story and the CGI are truly the cornerstones that make the franchise all the more enjoyable. And with the apes who are talking the CGI is in full swing making it all the more effective in its storytelling. Sure I'm more for practical stuff, but the CGI was used wisely and never catches you off guard. And sure their voices are not as on the levels as the human race or have the same types of weaponry as humans, but the film is so effective in its storytelling, you just forget that these simians are CGI. The special effects deserves award recognition come award season.And though the film can brag that the positives outweigh the negatives, there are still plenty of errors too as well. One of the guffaws includes the apes scoping the hideouts of the Colonel. Caesar is observing his nemesis through his binoculars. Luca (Terry Notary) Caesar's reliable ally. Luca asks in him in sign language if he sees the Colonel, but Caesar responds to him even though he isn't looking at Luca. There's others, but they don't hinder the movie that much.To say that this film ends the trilogy with a bang would be an understatement. But if they wish to make more films of this calibre 20th Century Fox can now take the liberties to create more stories along this route. With characters like Nova and Cornelius added to the franchise, this is the opening of potential prequels to the films that were made in the 1960's and 1970's. And though it is predictable, it still quenches your curiosity as to what will happen next. Of course this solidifies the trust we have in Matt Reeves as he'll be directing the next Batman film. Reeves did a great job in the last two films of this franchise as we look forward to his future projects.",War for the Planet of the Apes
78,yoggwork,"the sequel turned to ""human nature""",7,18 February 2019,"After the explosion of the second scene in the series, the sequel turned to ""human nature"", but unfortunately it turned out to be different.

79,bkrauser-81-311064,A Strong End to a Strong Trilogy,8,14 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes and by extension the Planet of the Apes reboot series (2011-Present) is a surprisingly rare breed in today's seemingly never ending cultural centrifuge. It's a remarkably old-fashioned movie - grandiose and exalted in a blockbuster-y way and definitely not as happily disposable as some. Every time a few years go by while we're all obsessing over Star Wars (1977-Present), Marvel (2008-Present), X-Men (2000-Present), Harry Potter (2001-Present), DC and whatever the hell they're trying to do with Godzilla; one of these Ape movies lands and practically instructs us on how sci-fi should be done. Then after months of discussion centered around the premise that Andy Serkis should get an Oscar for his motion capture work, the Ape series just seems to vanish from the cultural landscape. It's the equivalent of a dumb political argument being hashed out over Facebook where a third party drops some actual knowledge and gets nothing as far as responses.The irony of course is Planet of the Apes, from its inception is political allegory told with an almost refreshing amount of pedagoguery. It knows where it stands and dammit, if you're not right there with it, then you may as well be cracking the whip on the backs of its protagonists. Planet of the Apes (1968), Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) and certainly Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) are all impassioned screeds that highlight one form of contemporary injustice or another. And their none-too-shy about expressing it either.Which brings me to War of the Planet of the Apes which definitely follows in that tradition. I mean, the main villain is an angry, paranoid, borderline fascist, with arrogant notions of racial superiority, preoccupied with the building of a wall that will ultimately do nothing. After said villain (Harrelson) disrupts and devastates the lives of the intelligent apes, the lead ape Caesar (Serkis in beast-mode), resolves to put an end to this newest threat. He's aided of course by his most trusted brothers in arms Rocket (Notary), Luca (Adamthwaite) and Maurice (Konoval) all of whom accompany him on an almost mythic campaign to decide once and for all who will be the dominant species on the planet.To say more would constitute as spoilers, lest to say that the movie often doesn't go the way you would expect and it is always to the delight of the audience. The film's unexpected twists and turns are bolstered by director Matt Reeves's confident direction, Michael Seresin's masterful DP work and an evocative score by Michael Giacchino. Not satisfied with merely concluding the story, War for the Planet of the Apes injects just enough personal turmoil, moral ambiguities and moments of contemplation into the story to render it more fable-like than its predecessors. Let it be said that out of all the movies, War is the least about the many and more about ""the one."" Yet out of this ambition, also comes some of War's worst transgressions. Every emotional coda over the film's nearly two and a half hour run time yields fewer and fewer rewards, becoming noticeably askew sometime around Harrelson's well acted but clunky exposition dump. That problem is then compacted by a high-flying third act climax, that bends our suspension of disbelief with awkward staging, forced character changes and a resolution that feels just a bit too pat.There's no denying however, this installment will leave an impression and give audiences renewed appreciation for the series as a whole. I'd still contend that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the best film in the rebooted series, though War will invariably give us all something to really talk and think about. Whether it sticks is ultimately up to you.",War for the Planet of the Apes
80,valadas,An interesting story,7,19 July 2017,Told in excellent images. I have not seen the two previous versions of The Planet of The Apes so my review may seem a little awkward to those who have seen them since some comments would perhaps be also appropriate to those previous versions. Anyway this is a movie full both of action and emotional sentiment. The apes' impersonation is amazingly expressive in their anthropomorphic behaviour. This war between apes and humans favour the former much more in moral terms since the humans kill apes and even some of their soldiers out of combat in summary executions what the apes don't do. A fine action movie though this kind of movies usually don't allow them to be rated above my vote here.,War for the Planet of the Apes
81,jacobs-greenwood,"Akin to what Rogue One was for Star Wars, best for fans of the original",8,19 July 2017,"The original Planet of the Apes (1968) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) were the first sci-fi films that I can remember watching, having been born in 1960, and I preferred the former to the latter. I went on to see the sequel(s) for each, which is probably the reason that the Planet of the Apes remains a fond memory of my past; I even sought and watched every episode of its short-lived TV series. I saw Tim Burton's reboot and have seen the newest trilogy that culminated in this one.So it is with this backdrop that I can say that this is the best of the other films, save the original; the original has to be the best because it gave us the initial concept. This latest trilogy is faithful to that vision and is so multi-faceted, giving us much of what was lost in the films and series in between, by restoring the ""connection"" between man and the apes that was originally conceived and exhibited between Taylor (Charlton Heston) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) & Zira (Kim Hunter).Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) started by (re)establishing a strong (loving) relationship between man (James Franco's character) and ape, Caesar was the first chimpanzee that learns to speak. It gives a plausible reason for the development of his intellect, its spread among many other great apes (chimps, gorillas, bonobos, and orangutans), and the resulting virus that proves deadly to man.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) reveals a remnant of virus- immune humans and their battle with the Caesar-led apes. Jason Clarke plays the human that 'connects' with Caesar, but this is the weakest of the three newer films. It's necessary because it affirms the distrust and strife between the species and establishes through Koba, a bonobo who'd been abused by man, that apes can be just as evil as man.In much the same way that Rogue One (2016) is for Star Wars (1977), War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) serves as a bridge to Planet of the Apes (1968), introducing characters and story lines that were realized in the original. Not an easy task for such a franchise. We meet Nova (Heston's squeeze) as a child, and learn why she couldn't speak, Cornelius (Roddy McDowell's character), and the orangutan that becomes the lawgiver, Maurice (a nod to the actor from the original).While there is plenty of war action in this one, what impressed this reviewer most was the humanity exhibited, by both man and (surprisingly) ape. Despite all the killing and violence between the two groups, there are tender - really beautiful - moments, even between those with the most animosity towards each other: Caesar and The Colonel, played by the ubiquitous Woody Harrelson. It's really quite well done, especially the character development, and highly recommended, especially for those with nostalgia for the first installment of the franchise.",War for the Planet of the Apes

83,arungeorge13,A fitting end to Caesar's saga! [+80%],8,16 July 2017,"'War of the Planet of the Apes', the third (and supposedly final) instalment in the Apes trilogy revolving around Caesar and his troop, is a work of art. Matt Reeves, co-writer and director, opens the film by placing the viewer right in the midst of a battle scene involving apes and humans (a military wing led by the tyrannic Colonel). Both sides end up with a few casualties while the apes fend off the attack by choosing to send a warning message (not to come after them!) to the Colonel's faction.While Caesar (played by the wildly talented 'performance capture' legend Andy Serkis) devises a plan to avoid further fatalities by moving his clan to a safer point (across a desert), the Colonel and his team make a swooping entry into the ape enclosure in the dark of the night and murder Caesar's wife Cornelia and eldest son Blue Eyes.Fueled by revenge, Caesar decides to hunt down the Colonel himself but is ultimately accompanied by Maurice (Karin Konoval), Rocket (Terry Notary) and Luca (Michael Adamthwaite). They come across a little mute girl (the adorable Amiah Miller) who is, by circumstance orphaned by Caesar and later adopted by Maurice to be part of their tribe and christened 'Nova' (hint: A 1968 Easter egg). They also encounter Bad Ape (Steve Zahn), who lives in an abandoned memento store. The film takes its own sweet time to set up the premise, build character and analyze the impact of decisions made by each one of them. The writing is elaborate and supported by terrific CGI work from Weta Digital. Matt Reeves does away with assembling massive battle set-pieces and instead chooses to arrest the tempo a bit, lending ample screen-time for both 'scenes' and 'cinematic moments'.Woody Harrelson is downright evil as the unnerving Colonel who explains how he believes he's right in wanting to persecute everyone infected (including his son). Bad Ape lightens up the mood a bit in an otherwise serious flick. Amiah Miller's presence is substantiated in a couple of cleverly written scenes that tug at the viewer's heartstrings ('aww' moments) in both halves. Here is one film that musters up courage in saying that humans are the antagonists for believing that they're the most intelligent of all and possess authority over all other species. No points in guessing that the viewer obviously roots for the apes to win over the vicious humans (ascribed to sublime writing). Reeves makes sure that the newer audience do not feel left out when it comes to understanding the synopsis. In fact Bad Ape sums it up neatly when he says ""Humans get sick, Apes get smart, Humans kills apes!"". 'WOTPOTA' does remind you of 'Logan', 'The Revenant', 'Apocalypse Now' and 'The Great Escape' in terms of its narration style, character portrayal and setting.While the climactic conflict gets underway, there's an exciting plot twist (a marvelously executed reversal of fate!) that stands out triumphantly over the physics of the set-piece. Again, credit goes to Reeves for churning out one of the best possible finales for Caesar's saga..a satiating cinematic experience that blends splendid performances (both motion-capture and otherwise) with dazzling visual effects. Cinematography by Michael Seresin captures the landscape in all its natural glory (using wide-angle shots) while the camp-scenes possess a shade of melancholy. Music by Michael Giacchino does most of the talking in the film (especially in the first hour).Verdict: A blockbuster with heart!",War for the Planet of the Apes
84,omendata,Superb Movie,8,17 October 2017,"Haven't seen many good movies this year with a message but was pleasantly surprised at this; definitely the best in the series. I especially liked the non-American usual happy ending.Cannot for the life of me understand the negative reviews especially with one star - cmon that just isn't realistic unless the movie was made for $1000 and has zero story and terrible acting which this most definitely is not!I like the tie in with the original movie in many aspects such as the apes crucified on X crosses much like the original Forbidden zone markers and you could call this the prequel to the excellent Charlton Heston original.Great acting on the whole and whilst the story might not have been what most of the negative reviewers wanted it held me throughout; I guess some people are just too grown up and cant let the inner child out - If you can watch old episodes of DR WHO from the 70's and suspend disbelief and still enjoy them then you still have the inner child and are not one of these sad individuals who have to nit pick every small detail and expect everything to be as it is in real life - we go to the cinema to be taken out of real life and immersed in another world for a few hours which is what i feel the cinema should be for in the main!If i wanted to be depressed and watch real life i would turn on the evening news.Superb film one of the best Scifi of the year of which there hasn't been much lately!Suspend disbelief, let the inner child out and go watch this and you will surely enjoy it - if on the other hand you are a critical, sad old faerte with no imagination and want everything on a plate just stay at home and watch the evening news with your slippers and pipe in front of the fire! >;o)",War for the Planet of the Apes
85,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Finely Made Addition to the Planet of the Apes franchise.,9,12 September 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a mouthful of a title, and the film itself provides satisfactory beats that the last two films were leading up to. We're closer to the world seen in the original Planet of the Apes, though this one presumably takes place in a totally different timeline and universe to the classic Charlton Heston film from 1968. And there's a very odd thing happening here with these reboot movies: every sequel in THIS series is better than the previous sequels. 'War' is a great sequel to 'Rise' and 'Dawn' respectively; and the sequels to 'Rise' have been much stronger than the sequels to the original Planet of the Apes film. At least I think these sequels are stronger than the past ones.Andy Serkis is great here, Woody Harrelson is great too (a bit of a Hitler and Trump thing going on with his character I think), and this film is memorable conclusion to a trilogy of films we didn't know we wanted to have. There's sure to be more films down the track from 'Apes', but damn 'War' is a good film in itself.See this one once it's out on DVD and BluRay, or Digital Video.",War for the Planet of the Apes
86,Troy_Campbell,An appropriately epic and affecting trilogy-closer.,8,29 July 2017,"A trilogy-closer for the modern Planet of the Apes outings, we reunite with ape leader Caesar (a motion captured Andy Serkis) as he seeks to locate a safe haven for his clan whilst avoiding war with the humans. Trouble is, after the high-casualty conflict caused by Caesar's troubled right-hand ape Koba (Toby Kebbell – back here in dream sequences only) in the previous film, a battalion of men led by Woody Harreslon's ruthless Colonel are out for blood. Opening with two gripping battles—the first loud, intense and full of explosions; the second a suspenseful sneak attack with brutal results—the action stakes are set high and the narrative tempo is set fast. So much so the remainder of the movie struggles to maintain either. Screenwriters Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves continue the series' bleak theme of how narrow-mindedness causes self-destruction, the uncompromising sombreness and occasional over-sentimentality tolerable due to the immense intelligence and maturity imbued in the story. Reeves, who also directs, furthers this world primarily through character development, Caesar again proving to be one of the most complex and engaging protagonists in blockbusters today; his potency as a revered leader coming from the sacrifice and emotional turmoil he endures to protect his kind. Caesar's ability to captivate comes courtesy of a joint effort, with Serkis' passionate and tormented performance captured and enhanced by the visual effects team who then produce beautiful and flawless photorealistic CGI. There are also relatively minor moments littered throughout that have a lasting effect: meeting Steve Zahn's lonely and slightly crazy simian Bad Ape, Caesar's rage at the torture dished out to a slave ape, and mute girl Nova (Amiah Miller) quietly entering a prison to feed the hungry. It may not stick the landing due to a finale that strangely restrains Harrelson's villain, but it's easily forgiven thanks to the goodwill built by the franchise through crediting its audience as grown-ups who can engage with the weighty and intellectual themes on offer. Arguably the greatest trilogy since Nolan's Batman films, WFTPOTA provides this rebooted series with an appropriately epic, affecting and contemplative closing chapter.",War for the Planet of the Apes

89,proud_luddite,one of the better big-budget films,7,13 January 2018,"In the third segment of a trilogy: Caesar (Andy Serkis) is the leader of a tribe of an advanced ape species, fighting against the advances of an insurgent group of human soldiers lead by a renegade colonel (Woody Harrelson).The locales and photography in the first half of the film leave the viewer with a visual treat especially some wintry scenes during a long journey in the snow. Adding to this excitement are a great musical score and superb visual effects that give the ape characters human-like facial expressions.When the novelty wears off around the half-way point the film remains good though it is somewhat less exciting as it falls into a standard plot of characters wrongly imprisoned and mistreated while wanting to escape. Followed by a spectacular final half-hour (albeit with a rather emotionally manipulative closing scene), ""War of the Planet of the Apes"" succeeds as a rarity: a modern, big-budget film with a story that is good, characters that deal with inner-conflict, and - most important - it is understandable.",War for the Planet of the Apes
90,maurice_yacowar,Caesar saves apes from white supremacist's slaughter,8,20 July 2017,"Beneath the superb special effects and the genuinely moving simian pathos lies a parable for our time. As from the franchise's outset, this human vs. ape confrontation portrays the tragic folly of our continuing impulse to demonize and to subjugate another race/nation/people.The Kurtzian arch-villain Colonel (Woody Harrelson) is a white supremacist who claims control of nature: ""All of human history has lead to this moment. The irony is we created you. And nature has been punishing us ever since. This is our last stand. And if we lose... it will be a Planet of Apes."" The film is prequel to the first Planet of the Apes, pitched shortly after our time, so that a beanie reads Bedtime for Bonzo (a classic Reagan '50s comedy).The Colonel acknowledges the apes' superior strength. ""No matter what you say, eventually you'd replace us,"" he tells his captive Caesar. ""That's the law of nature. So what would you have done?"" Racist belligerence is painted as self-defence. Sound familiar?Caesar's apes represent a more responsible civilization: ""We are not savages. Apes fight only to survive."" He sends human prisoners back with the message: ""Leave us the woods and the killing can stop."" But the bellicose humans can't stop themselves from fear, hatred and killing. The Colonel's particular fear now is that mankind may be wiped out by a rampaging virus that has been attacking humans, stopping their speech, killing them. The mute girl Maurice adopts proves humanity survives that virus. (Full disclosure: Ya gotta love a film where the leader's wise adviser is an orangutan named Maurice.) But the Colonel's campaign to preserve humanity is itself destroying it. The Colonel speaks for our current extremists around the globe when he maintains: ""There are times when it is necessary to abandon our humanity to save humanity."" As its happens, that's how the current American presidency paints its sweeping sacrifice of democracy.The Colonel considers himself fighting ""a Holy War"" — on two fronts. Against the apes he is defending his own culture, however self-destructive and compromised. But he is also facing an attack from a large army of humans from the north, his own military superiors, who are coming to remove the madman from their service. The Colonel needs the apes' slave labour to rebuild the military outpost where he will defend himself against his own. He will exhaust them, then annihilate themAs in the modern Middle East, however, and contrary to tradition, the enemy of your enemy could still be your enemy. The northern army itself also wants to destroy the apes. After the apes have defeated the Colonel, they are immediately bombarded by the other army, all garbed in white. Why in white?Because here nature at last intervenes. Nature reminds us its stronger than man. The Colonel claims the white man is the master of nature, that any other species is beneath him on The Great Chain of Being, that his arrogance and slaughter are on the side of the natural. But the white-uniformed army is wiped out by a snowy avalanche. The white nature overwhelms the presumptuous humans, white and uniformly clad in white. Though the political allegory here is global it has particular reference to Israel's continuing struggle for survival. Like the Jews, Caesar's apes ask only for a secure homeland. They don't want to continue war and killing. Some seek the false security of assimilation — like the apes who serve the Colonel, who are abused, called Donkey, but sustain their vain hope of acceptance. Caesar's name evokes the Roman period when the Jews were driven out of Judea and robbed of their roots and identity. The avalanche that saves the apes recalls the Red Sea's drowning of the pharaoh's forces, finally freeing the Israelites from Egyptian enslavement. Like Moses, too, Caesar gets to see the Promised Land — a desert much like the desert Israel transformed into fertility and modern science — but he doesn't get to enter. Caesar's personal growth is also pertinent to Israel. Through most of the film he is determined to act on his own to avenge the murder of his wife and older son. He imperils and loses some of his people by this vendetta. But he finally subdues this demon. He saves his people — yeah, I know, they're apes, but still — by subordinating his personal campaign to theirs. In his climactic gesture he doesn't kill the humbled Colonel who tortured him and cost him so dearly. Instead he allows him the respectful suicide. Caesar's hands stay clean.As Israel has faced relentless attack since 1948 (and its people there from even before statehood), that lesson is important. Vengeance is a terrible temptation. Forgiveness is hard, so it's necessary if peace is ever to supplant war. Of course, before the Israelis can lay down their arms, forgo vengeance, stop fighting back, the Palestinians might be well advised to stop killing them and to accept peaceful coexistence and prosperity with the Jewish state. And so around the world, where people at war demonize each other, deny the other's humanity and strive to annihilate them. That's not natural.",War for the Planet of the Apes
91,rockman182,War For the Planet of the Apes (2017),8,27 July 2017,"God, the titles for the films in this trilogy are really bad. At least the films are good though. I liked Rise, thought it was a fun re-imagining/reboot of the Apes universe. I didn't love Dawn, but it was good (although I have a hard time remembering parts of it). Matt Reeves taking the helm of the films changed the direction and pace and overall theme of what the first film laid out. After watching War, I can safely say that this is far and away the best film in the trilogy and a satisfying end to the rebooted films.This film takes place some time after war where the war between apes and humans is continuing, although both sides have taken significant losses. Cesar and his loyal apes have to deal with betrayal and capture by humans at a prisoner base. The much more hardened Cesar now has to find out how to rescue his fellow apes while struggling with wanting revenge against the humans who have harmed him.CGI-wise this is still fabulous. Andy Serkis playing Cesar is at its finest. The motion capture and its portrayal is very good. The soundtrack is also very complementary of the mood of the film. This film is actually really emotional, much more so then you have seen in all of The Planet of the Apes films in the past. This is great because its so easy to connect with the characters (mostly the apes). Most of them are inherently innocent and the conflicted ones even are this way because they need to survive.Don't expect a full blown action flick with this film. Its set in war time but is more about the complexities of its characters and the war time struggle that comes with it. Its woven in a way where the interactions of humans and the apes takes center stage. There is comedic elements, some memorable action sequences , and overall its a grand finale to a pretty good trilogy. The last film is substantially better than the others and really does well to elevate the entire trilogy.8/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
92,jon.h.ochiai,The Nature of Our Humanity,10,16 July 2017,"What is the nature of humanity? Is humanity being human? In the unspoken scene in Director Matt Reeves's ""War for the Planet of the Apes"", the mute blonde girl, played by amazing Amaih Miller, cries as she takes the cherry blossom flower from her hair and places upon the fallen ape, who sacrificed to save Simian messiah Caesar, played by powerful Andy Serkis. The cherry blossom was the gift of kindness from the Ape. No words are spoken as tears fall from the girl's eyes, and Michael Giacchino's eloquent score breaks our hearts. Humanity is valuing all life, and seeing the nobility in that life. That is the beauty of Writer and Director Matt Reeves's ""War for the Planet of the Apes"". His narrative imagery is pristine and bold. The movie opens in the misty forest as Special Forces commandos attack the outpost of Ape Leader Caesar. Caesar demonstrating his acute strategy defeats the soldiers. He sends a message to the survivors, ""I did not start this war"" In this final chapter of the trilogy, Caesar distinguishes himself as the brave merciful leader hoping to coexist with Man, who only seeks annihilation of the Apes. But Caesar suffers tragedy at the hands of the Colonel, played by charismatic manic Woody Harrelson. The Colonel is without mercy, and now the noble Caesar wants his revenge. The imagery of ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is stunning. Michael Seresin's cinematography is astounding. He opens with the misty forest weapons battle. The snowy prison compound run by the Colonel is austere and foreboding. He captures the freedom and spirit of our heroes as their horses gallop along the beach at sunset. The visual portraits give life to the poignant narrative written by Reeves and Mark Bomback. Andy Serkis is a wonder as Caesar. His performance is the masterful blend of CGI and powerful actor. We see the compassion, fear, and courage in Caesar's human eyes and gentle visage. As Caesar we believe in the humanity of his kind, and doubt our own. Caesar's defining other is Harrelson's Colonel, who embodies man's inhumanity to all. Harrelson's Colonel is a take on Colonel Kurtz from ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Heart of Darkness"". His madness is visceral. He tells Caesar of his own actions, ""You are taking this way too personal."" Reeves eloquently unveils the Colonel's own tragic irony. In the storyline, the Simian Virus mutates Apes with great intellect and speaking language. Conversely, the virus robs humans of speaking, and devolves them to the vastly primitive animal. Reeves brilliantly intertwines the captivating dialogue and sign language of the evolving Apes. This represents the new stage of evolution and the new order. However, even evolution meets with resistance, especially in the human concerns. Perhaps, mercy is the most profound distinction of humanity. Reeves powerfully explores this in ""War"". There is not black and white resolution in the gray nature of the world we live. I think Reeves spends a little too much time in the snowy Ape prison, time slowly ebbs there. However, ""War"" has distinct power and nobility. It's amazing that the story of evolving Apes inspire, and make us think about our own humanity. Have compassion and value all life. The Ape leader Caesar reminds of this, and so does Director Reeves. ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is one of the year's best. It makes us look into our very souls, as well.",War for the Planet of the Apes
93,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A fitting end to a pretty good prequel trilogy.,8,8 March 2019,"There's something special about the final film in a ""prequel trilogy"" that almost defies explanation. It acts as a springboard to the original content while also tying up all the loose ends that presented themselves in the previous installments of the trilogy. Since the source material is well-known, a viewer can deduce how it will end, but not necessarily how it will get there. In this sense, movies like Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) share a common theme as links between the new and the old.Similar in tone to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), War continues the escalating conflict between the titular apes and the now-endangered humans. Unfortunately, because it places Caesar (Andy Serkis) as the primary protagonist of the whole trilogy, the ""savior"" parallels are a little too heavy-handed here. Heck, they should have titled it Passion of the Planet of the Apes. Still, holding true to the original Planet of the Apes (1968), War almost felt like an homage to another 1960's classic as well: The Great Escape (1963).Of course, while I enjoyed this prequel trilogy and reveled in its impressive computer-generated imagery, it does produce a particular divergence from the original franchise. I haven't seen them in a while, but I'm not sure these rebooted films hold up to the plot continuity of the original ""prequel trilogy"" that was Escape (1972), Conquest (1972), and Battle (1973). Either way, War stands as an excellent end to a reboot series, replete with immediate and long-term foreshadowing that leads people to go back and watch the original Planet of the Apes.A fitting end to a pretty good prequel trilogy, I give War for the Planet of the Apes 4.0 stars out of 5.",War for the Planet of the Apes
94,RforFilm,"After the rise and dawn, War for the Planet of the Apes is a deep and emotional conclusion to Caesar's story",9,17 July 2017,"If you want to talk about how a proper reboot of a series is done, then The Planet of the Apes is the answer. I'll admit that I've seen none of the old movies, though I'm already aware of the big spoiler from the original, which is practically one of the most famous twists of all time. But I'm not here to talk about those, but rather the reboot movies that started with Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Rather then remaking the original, it chose to take a different spin on how the apes became intelligent enough to pose a threat to the humans. Rise of the Planet of the Apes proved to be a major surprise with a lot of critics and audiences finding a lot of sympathy with not only the apes, but apes that were completely computer generated. Plus you have to give a lot of credit to actor Andy Serkis (Gollum from The Lord of the Rings) who brings a lot of depth to his character Caesar and all through the magic of motion capture. Now that Rise and Dawn had built up how this world has succumbed to it's own troubles, we get the finale of the prequel trilogy with War for the Planet of the Apes. Set years after Dawn, Caesar (played by Andy Serkis) is still haunted by his memories of Koba, an ape that started the war between the humans and primates. Though they all seem to be living safe in the Muir forest, the Alpha-Omega, who seem to be the remaining U.S. military forces, come in to try to take out the apes. Caesar announces that he wants the entire clan to move out in the desert where they will be safe from the human. The night before they were to leave, their fortress is attacked and Caesar's wife Cornelia are killed by the leader of the Alpha-Omega, The Colonel (played by Woody Harrelson).Caesar orders the apes to set out for the desert while he heads to the Alpha-Omega headquarters to kill the Colonel in revenge. He's joined by orangutan Maurice, and fellow chimpanzee Rocket to make sure that Caesar is safe. The apes discover many things including a mute human orphan girl that Maurice adopts, an ape named ""Bad Ape"" (played by Steve Zahn), and that the virus that killed most humans may be worse for the ones that lived. Caesar and the apes make it to the headquarters to discover something horrible.As far as this is going, War for the Planet of the Apes continues to rise like the apes who want to be seen as smart and elusive. This movie accomplishes that goal and them some. This happens to be a blockbuster that delivers on the action, but manages to put a lot of emotion into the idea that your about to take on the responsibility of leadership. Sure, some may already see this as a story that doesn't end well for the humans, but you see the tragedy of that the weight Caesar feels when he comes to this conclusion.War for the Planet of the Apes takes cues from the previous Ape movies and revenge westerns to make this the most personal journey for Caesar he has had to undergo. His journey takes him through a beautifully shot film that flows at smooth place, though it does become a little too slow before they reach the humans hideout. Had the CGI been bad, this movie would have fell apart, but I found myself constantly forgetting that I was watching that. The apes have some of the most reactive faces that could rival any bad human actor.Of course I have to talk about Andy Serkis who remains a highly underrated actor. I'm not sure why motion capture performances are rarely noted, but his response through the machines his fantastic. I don't think it's Oscar worthy, but he brings a lot of depth to his character and even seems to connect with his other performances simultaneously to create an arc that spans the three movies. While the humans do well, this movie belongs to the apes who can proudly claim this as their magnum-opus.I'll give this nine Caesars out of ten. While you don't need to see the other movies, I'd still recommend doing so before checking this out. While I'm glad to see this trilogy end on a high note, I'm curious to see if the box office grossings would justify more movies from this series (maybe a possible adaptation of the original Planet of the Apes?). Give the apes their movie and check it out.",War for the Planet of the Apes

After losing a lot of apes because of the war that's raging on between the apes & humans, Caesar decides to avenge his fallen brethren. War for the Planet of the Apes is an excellent film. Director Matt Reeves has improved upon his previous directorial outing in the franchise, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes(2014). This movie is also superior to the franchise reboot, Rise of the Planet of the Apes(2011). The visual effects are phenomenal. The motion capture technology used to portray Caesar & the other apes' emotions & movement, is flawless. The action set pieces are epic. The climactic set piece definitely stands out. The 3D gets you more immersed in the proceedings on screen. The performances are the highlight of the film. Andy Serkis is sensational as Caesar. Serkis expertly portrays the various emotions that Caesar feels, during the course of the movie. Woody Harrelson is spectacular as The Colonel. Harrelson's portrayal of the antagonist of the film, is layered & complex. Steve Zahn provides some much needed comic relief, as Bad Ape. Karin Konoval is fantastic as Maurice. Amiah Miller is outstanding as Nova. Terry Notary is superb as Rocket. Ty Olsson is good as Red Donkey.

99,fernandoschiavi,A worthy and satisfying conclusion to this new trilogy that will definitely be remembered as one of the best commercial American cinema has ever seen,8,22 November 2020,"War for Planet of the Apes offers a satisfactory conclusion to this new phase. Mature and at the same time poetic, War for the Planet of the Apes ends with a flourish one of the best current trilogies. Showing the outcome of the war between apes and humans, the third film is much more than the final clash between the races, it is the end point of a powerful discussion started since the first film about our sense of humanity and superiority that never leaves us.In this closing of the most recent trilogy, humans and apes cross paths again. Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his group are forced into a war against an army of soldiers led by a ruthless colonel (Woody Harrelson), who does his best to ensure his survival when the virus that has decimated humanity begins to present a new side effect: speech loss in humans. When Caesar suffers a personal loss in a conflict, he sets up a personal mission to locate and neutralize the Colonel, aiming to end the war between humans and apes once and for all.In War for the Planet of the Apes, Matt Reeves concludes the prelude to the story of the 1968 film (based on the book by Frenchman Pierre Boulle) with the same urgencies as the previous features (Rise of the planet of the apes, 2011, and Dawn of the planet of the apes, 2014). The tone, however, is different, in a biblical mix of conflict and restart. Over a little over six years, we have followed César's evolution (a remarkable work by Andy Serkis). Not only from a technological point of view, with a clear leap in the movement capture technique (of which Serkis has already become an ambassador), but above all from a narrative perspective, full of meanings.
If Matt Reeves and screenwriter Mark Bomback had already offered something very simplistic and straightforward in Dawn of the planet of the apes, they further reduce the scale and events in War, which is limited to a journey of personal revenge in a narrative without many elements, nuclei of history or even dialogues. Almost all of the 140 minutes of projection are dedicated to Caesar and the core of apes, never diverting the point of view to any human character, who occupy - in the majority - the position of antagonism of the feature. This guarantees the most beautiful and rare moments in the current american blockbuster cinema scene, where various actions and thoughts are resolved through sign language, looks or simple bodily interactions; although César's speech is much improved in this film. The third part of the new franchise trilogy is not as exciting in terms of action as the previous film, but it certainly reflects and discusses its main themes with more depth and maturity than its predecessors.Precisely for these moments, the first act and the beginning of the second are the best moments of the projection. With an impressive opening scene that accompanies the soldiers invading the territory of the apes, Reeves does the favor of avoiding the pyrotechnics of the endless (nothing against, but they contributed little to the evolution of the narrative in the previous features) battle scenes. The war that the title announces takes place much more in a psych sociological field than in front scenes. The small expedition led by Caesar, made up of his companions Maurice (Karin Konoval), Rocket (Terry Notary) and Luca (Michael Adamthwaite) is a strong remnant of western cinema, with the quartet riding slowly across icy landscapes on Canadian soil, and especially melancholic because we are in a post-apocalyptic environment. In this way, we obtained beautiful images that Reeves and cinematographer Michael Seresin, also guaranteeing a good rhythm and a highly immersive atmosphere - the fantastic soundtrack by Michael Giacchino also deserves credits in the creation of this universe, bringing a beautiful waltz as a final theme.
Reeves and screenwriter Mark Bomback draw the parallels between fictional dystopia and our world: two opposing forces are at war with each other because of their distinct worldviews. It looks familiar, doesn't it? The similarities with reality are even more accentuated with the introduction of the Colonel (Woody Harrelson), the military leader who, in order to protect his soldiers, wants to build a wall that separates them from their enemies. The script builds the character in such a way that he personifies the worst in societies around the world today: the fear and hatred of the different, the subversion of the concept of justice to an ideal of revenge, the lack of dialogue and the widespread hostility to anything that might go against an old-fashioned concept of ""morals and good manners"".The emotional plot of War for the Planet of the Apes comes with great action sequences. Matt Reeves delivers an excellent direction completely inspired by New Hollywood from the 70s: the filmmaker applies here framing, lighting and camera movement techniques used by Stanley Kubrick (using the classic centralized framing), Martin Scorsese (using the cuts to create a vibrant rhythm for the scenes), Francis Ford Coppola (taking advantage of lights and shadows to create an atmosphere and reflect the mood of the characters on screen). The influence of films like Apocalypse Now, The Bridge on the River Kwai and The Ten Commandments is explicit. In this amalgamation of genres, Reeves, who signs the script with Mark Bomback, tells an epic story without falling into Manichaeism and goes far beyond the promise of the title war. The Colonel is not a mere villain in his opposition to Caesar, just as the hero is not perfect or infallible. The meeting of the two exposes the complex nature that determines ""humanity"" in the search for survival. Relationships packed with grandeur on the Michael Giacchino score, which alternates brutality and lightness in a journey of many layers, including bringing us a beautiful waltz as a final theme.Reeves proves that he knows not only how to use all the space on the screen, but how to position his camera in a way to decentralize the viewer's gaze. Even when working with gangs, the action does not become dull or lose focus. The camera follows the characters, without losing life in the midst of shots and explosions. The rhythm is built alternating between play and conflict, drama and humor, in a composition that never loses strength in the two hours and twenty minutes of the film fly by. In the first scene, we start with a long shot that introduces us to the soldiers, culminating in a violent confrontation and that already shows us how the visual effects are supernatural: the hair, looks and the light reflect in an extremely realistic way on the apes, each increasingly expressive. Reeves also brings his suspenseful hand from Let Me in and Cloverfield for more tense sequences, like the first encounter between Caesar and the Colonel; marked by shadows and beams of light from weapons and laser sights, and the great battle that ends the projection, full of small conflicts and climaxes that grab the viewer by the throat. It is impossible not to be moved.
The biggest problem is even in the second act, where the narrative takes a curve that appeals to its unpredictability, but ends up sinning in terms of rhythm and duration. More focused on what happens in the human nucleus, it is where Reeves and Bomback end up ""trying too hard"" to reach a dramatic and melancholic level, as if the thematic and visual reference to the Holocaust and Fascism were not enough by themselves - a similar problem that also hit Logan, where the film seems to try too hard to be something more complex and adult - although the dialogues of the excellent Woody Harrelson make this effort worthwhile. Guerra works precisely in its most subtle moments, and this exposure ends up harming and disturbing the good rhythm, besides extending the duration of the film too much.In addition to Reeves and Harrelson, another name that stands out in War for the Planet of the Apesis Andy Serkis, again giving life - through the performance capture technique, which makes the experience visceral. It is possible to see the actor in Cesar's eyes and, at the same time, completely forget the elaborate process necessary for the character to come to life. What you see is in fact a chimpanzee who loves his family, needs to guide a people and overcome a conflict in the search for a civilized life. Serkis transcends layers of equipment and delivers genuine emotion, with an impressive degree of expression and mastery of the body.Planet of the Apes: The War is a worthy and satisfying conclusion to this new trilogy that will definitely be remembered as one of the best commercial American cinema has ever seen. With a greater focus on personal dramas and metamorphoses, Pierre Boulle's creation has never been better represented. War for the Planet of the Apes is a cinematic experience of technical quality and dramatic reach. It is the return of classic cinema in technological packaging, made to entertain, but without underestimating its audience. The work may slightly disappoint those who seek an apotheosis even more frantic than Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, but it will certainly delight and dazzle those who, in the midst of so many shallow blockbusters, are looking for a commercial film that knows how to discuss their own themes with sobriety, maturity and without appealing to pedantry.",War for the Planet of the Apes

102,dave-mcclain,This one wasn't as good as I expected. It was better - much better!,9,14 July 2017,"""War! What is it good for?"" soul singer Edwin Starr famously asked in 1970. Since the song came out at the height of the Vietnam War, it's doubtful that humans fighting apes for control of the planet is what Starr had in mind. Or maybe it was. Two years earlier, legendary actor Charlton Heston starred in the film that launched a franchise. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" told the story of a group of astronauts who landed on a planet inhabited by apes that could talk and humans that couldn't, only to discover (50-year-old spoiler alert) that the planet was earth in the distant future. In that case, the humans had clearly lost and earth had become a planet of apes. Then, a series of early 1970s prequels and sequels told the story of how that happened and what were the long-term repercussions of all of it. Next up (deliberately skipping over the silly 2001 remake), 2011's ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" introduced Movie Fans to a pet chimp named Caesar who learned to talk and later led a rebellion against his human oppressors. In 2014, ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" more clearly drew the battle lines between apes and humans, while 2017's ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (PG-13, 2:20) takes that conflict to a whole new level and shows us a war that's at least good for determining who will dominate the entire planet.As this film opens, the intelligent talking chimpanzee known as Caesar (performed for the third time by Andy Serkis, again via motion capture technology) is fully in charge of the colony of apes living in the woods of northern California and dealing with the fall-out from the events of the previous film. The humans' numbers continue to diminish due to the Simian Flu, which is caused by ALZ-113, the same drug which caused the apes to develop human-like intelligence and gave some the ability to speak. As if that weren't bad enough, the virus has mutated, causing people who catch it to lose the power of speech and regress to a more primitive intellect. The humans are also still angry at the apes because of the apes' attack on San Francisco in the last film. In an attempt to preserve what's left of the human race, a rogue military leader known as The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) is killing any people whom he suspects of being infected by the virus – while also trying to wipe out the ape population. After repelling one attack by the Colonel's forces, Caesar sends the survivors back to their camp with the message that leaving the apes alone in the woods could stop the fighting between ape and man. But the apes are also making plans to migrate across a vast wasteland to a distant location where they can live in peace.After an even more devastating attack by the Colonel and his men, the apes set out in search of that new home, but Caesar won't go with them. He's grown angry, bitter and vengeful and has decided to go after the Colonel personally, but Caesar's trusted lieutenants, Rocket (Terry Notary), Maurice (Karin Konoval) and Luca (Michael Adamthwaite) insist on coming to help. Along the way, they join forces with another talking chimpanzee called Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) and pick up a young, orphaned mute girl whom they start calling Nova (Amiah Miller). When the group finds the Colonel's camp, they are horrified to discover that his soldiers have captured and enslaved the ape community that had left the woods and are now forcing them to build a wall around the camp. This begs the question as to what or whom the Colonel is worried about keeping out, but also sets up a battle of wits between him and Caesar and a struggle for survival between apes and humans which seems destined to culminate in an epic battle.""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is a fantastic movie which represents the culmination of one terrific trilogy. This ""Planet of the Apes"" series established an interesting and layered mythology that continues to build on itself and get better and better as it develops. The third movie is influenced by many earlier films from various genres and decades, but is perhaps best understood as a combination of the classics ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and (especially) ""The Ten Commandments"". The intricate plotting by returning scribes Mark Bomback and Matt Reeves makes for an engrossing film that is filled with rich symbolism and important lessons for all of us real-life talking primates. Reeves is also back in the director's chair and again gives us a well-paced story full of action, excitement, suspense and heart. Last, but not least, the visual effects and acting are every bit as outstanding as in the previous two films (if not better) – especially when it comes to the motion capture performances, particularly that of Serkis. (And would the movie awards community please FINALLY recognize motion capture performances simply as PERFORMANCES, as worthy of accolades for excellence as any other, whether accomplished through prosthetics, from within intricate costumes and hair-styling or just with the simple but skillful use of the voice, face and body!) Now, returning to the question asked at the beginning of this review, what is war good for? In this case, one exceptional film. ""A""",War for the Planet of the Apes
103,joebloggscity,Fitting finale that wins the war for this movie,8,6 January 2018,"You got to admire the producers and directors of this trilogy. They took a gamble in reimagining this franchise. Well loved and a sci-fi classic, we are made to rethink our own morality through the structure of a society of rebellious apes, and it could so easily have gone wrong. It hasn't, and this film caps a great trilogy, something that practically all other trilogy series have struggled or failed to do.First and foremost, I'm a very big fan of the original film, and have watched it countless times. The sequels? Well, not as enamoured with the latter ones, the Tim Burton one we'll forget. This though is a great update, although yes it doesn't necessarily capture as many philosophical strands as the very original, but few if any other films have.Back to this one, we have Andy Serkis in incredible form as Caesar, giving an award winning performance, likely to be overlooked due to CGI etc (and snobbery). He is ably supported by his group, and a new addition ""bad ape"" who steals the scenes he is in. Woody Harrelson is the bad guy but plays it great without cliches, and you really get to understand his character and that of others. There's very much more going on than you realise, but it all comes together and it works.Caesar is out for revenge, battling human emotions which have been magnified by his own consciousness. He struggles and we follow his path but empathy is very much there is when tested.It really is a deep movie, it's also beautifully filmed and I would very much recommend this. There is likely to be a further trilogy, and I look forward to it.This one finely caps off a great reimagining for me. Go ape for it!",War for the Planet of the Apes
104,Vivekmaru45,It wasn't an entertaining film for me.,3,20 October 2017,"This is the sequel to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), and follows events from the previous film.The theme of the film is liberation. If you think about it, the story is so common with The Ten Commandments directed by Cecil B. DeMille. So in this film, the chimpanzee Caesar plays the role that Moses played.Also, a thing you must ask yourself, is why they chose to name the chimpanzee Caesar. Caesar is actually derived from Julius Caesar who was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.He was later brutally assassinated. I recommend you to watch Julius Caesar (1970 film) which I think is the best adaptation of William Shakespeare's play, but I warn you the assassination scene depicted in the film is very graphic and disturbing. Back to this film: Two years after the U.S. military was called to fight off an increasingly intelligent and dangerous tribe of apes, starting a devastating war between the two species, the apes' clan, led by the chimpanzee Caesar, are attacked in the woods by a rogue paramilitary faction known as Alpha-Omega, led by a mysterious Colonel. Alpha-Omega has in its service apes (called ""donkeys"") that had previously followed Koba, a maniacal, human-hating bonobo who led a failed coup against Caesar and started the war after leading a vengeful attack against human survivors in San Francisco.Verdict: the theme of the film as I have mentioned earlier is liberation. Caesar's character suffers a lot from persecution, by both his own kind and humans. Woody Harrelson gives the same performance Marlon Brando did in Apocalypse Now(1979). Similarly, Harrelson's character is the same as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now. I was not impressed by the direction, script, photography and background sound-effects. Since this film deals largely with CGI graphics, the human casting seems irrelevant to discuss. Woody Harrelson is the only good actor who has gained fame with films like: Indecent Proposal(1993), Natural Born Killers(1994), Money Train(1995), The People vs. Larry Flynt(1996), Play It to the Bone(1999) and No Country for Old Men(2007).I was not impressed with Matt Reeves direction. He has made a film even worse than his earlier one. His best film for me remains Let Me In(2010), an American-British adaptation of the of the Swedish film Let the Right One In(2008).",War for the Planet of the Apes
105,swilliky,A decent ending to an exciting trilogy,7,16 July 2017,"The final film in the trilogy that serves as a prequel to the sci-fi classic delivers a bleak story that explains how the furry creatures inherited the planet. Caesar (Andy Serkis) leads the apes as they are attacked by a battalion of humans. They manage to fight off the humans but Caesar spares a few to return a message to the Colonel (Woody Harrelson). Caesar does not want a war but is haunted by the legacy of Koba. When an ape betrays them and reveals the location, the Colonel kills Caesar's wife and son. The apes leave their home and set out for the desert but Caesar decides to turn back and hunt down the Colonel. Refusing to leave his side are Luca (Michael Adamthwaite) a gorilla, Rocket (Terry Notary) another chimp, and Maurice (Karin Konoval) an orangutan. The crew set out finding a deserter and killing him. Inside his house is Nova (Amiah Miller), a mute girl affected by a strange disease.Maurice insists on taking the girl with them and the apes find the humans military camp. The Colonel has already moved on so Caesar and his group follow along towards a military base. Along the way, they encounter Bad Ape (Steve Zahn), a survivor of another group of apes that was wiped out by the humans. Bad Ape is a great source humor throughout the film that needs the lightheartedness when dealing with such a dire situation. The apes make it to the military base where they find apes imprisoned including Caesar's group. Luca is killed in a fight with the sentries. Caesar moves down there but is captured by the Red Donkey (Ty Olsson), a traitorous gorilla. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",War for the Planet of the Apes

107,bob-the-movie-man,"Putting the ""ape"" in ""The Great Esc-ape""",9,12 July 2017,"2011's ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was the one of the big movie surprises for me of that year. With staggeringly good mo-cap for the apes and a touching and memorable story it was for me was a 10* classic.  2014's ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" whilst also good took a slight backward step. With ""War"", the form is back almost to top notch, and this is a summer release at last deserving of the suffix ""blockbuster"".We have moved a number of years forwards from the events of ""Dawn"" and society as we know it has crumbled away still further: even the ""Holidays are Coming"" Coke lorry is no longer in service, so things MUST be bad!  We begin the film with the apes having a nice 'Centre Parcs' break when their reverie and cappuccinos are rudely interrupted by the attacking forces of ""The Colonel"" (Woody Harrelson, ""Triple 9"", ""Zombieland""). For The Colonel is intent on tracking down and killing ape-leader Caesar (Andy Serkis, ""LOTR"").After things get decidedly personal, Caesar leaves his young son Cornelius (in a nice nod to the Roddy McDowell role in the original films) to find and kill The Colonel. So follows a ""True Grit"" style pursuit/revenge chase, made more similar to this analogy by the picking up of a waif-like mute girl (the excellent Amiah Miller). I found this to be a really emotional plot line, with Caesar torn between the animal drive of his revenge and his role as a leader to his whole community.The film analogies continue as we take in a ""Shining""-style winter hotel; a gritty Prisoner-of-War camp escape drama (""The Great Esc- ape""?); a barricades battle in the style of Helm's Deep in ""LOTR: The Two Towers""; and a full-on Coppola-style helicopter-based war sequence (""Ape-ocalypse now"", as graffiti in the film declares).Once again, the mo-cap ability to express true emotions on the faces of the apes is mind-blowing, with Serkis again being outstanding as is Steve Zahn (""Dallas Buyer's Club"") adding some (very funny) comic relief as ""Bad Ape"".  While Woody Harrelson is not everyone's cup of tea (including mine), here I found him to be actually very good (""SO EMOTIONAL""!) as the half crazed dictator forcing beings he sees as less worthy than his kind to build a wall.  (That's just SO familiar... think dammit... think...!) There's a really cool plot twist in The Colonel's character arc that I really didn't see coming. Just so cool.   Another star of the film for me was Michael Giacchino's music which is simply awesome. Starting with a superbly retro rendition of the 20th Century Fox theme (not top of my list: ""The Simpson's Movie"" still holds that spot for me!) Giacchino decorates every scene with great themes and like all great film music some of it you barely notice. A dramatic telling by the Colonel of his back-story is accompanied by sonorous music that is similar in its power to James Horner's classic ""Electronic Battlefield"" in ""Patriot Games"": only when the scene finishes and the music stops do you appreciate how central it was to the emotion of the scene.  The script by ""Dawn"" collaborators Mark Bomback and (director) Matt Reeves is eventful and packs a dramatic punch particularly in the last half of the film. The talented Mr Reeves (who also directed ""Cloverfield"" and ""Let Me In"" and is assigned to direct the next Ben Affleck outing as ""The Batman"") directs with panache, never letting the foot come off the tension pedal.  On the downside, that ""last half of the film"" is still 70 minutes away, and whilst I appreciate a leisurely pace for properly setting characters and motivations in place, getting to those simply brilliant scenes set at ""the border"" is a bit of a slog that might have been tightened up and moved along a bit quicker. Also, while talking about editing, I would have personally ended the film about 90 seconds before they did.I saw this in 3D, but the effects are subtle at best (although there is a nice binocular rangefinder view).  In my opinion it's not worth going out of your way to experience in 3D.  But overall I loved this movie. The film is chock full of visual delights for film lovers (one of my favourites being ""Bedtime for Bonzo"" - a nice historical film reference - written on the back of a soldier's helmet). An epic action film with a strong emotional core to the story that genuinely moved me. There may be other spin-off Planet of the Apes films to follow. But if they left this here, as a near-perfect trilogy, that would be absolutely fine by me.  (For the full graphical review of the film, please visit bob-the- movie-man.com.

The CGI motion capturing and voice-over dubbing were, once again, superb (especially in Andy Cirkis' case). And the writing worthy of Rod Serling's first draft script for the 1968 classic!By that, I mean the screenplay for this movie does a credible job filling in the back story gaps left behind by the original quintet of films from Apjac and 20th Century Fox. Like, for instance; how could just one thousand years of ""barbarity,"" alone, reduce Linda-- the original Nova--Harrison's people to mute hunter-gatherers? Could it have been a slower-acting, undiagnosed side-effect of the same space germ that killed off all the cats and dogs on Earth (as mentioned in CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES)? Speaking of Nova: young Amiah Miller was suitably tender to watch in her interactions with Luca and Maurice. I hope she does at least a couple more films before heading off to college in six years. And Steve Zahn provides hilarious (and occasionally much-needed) comic relief as the Ben Gunn-esque Bad Ape.Last, but not least? Let's talk about Woody Harrelson. He's come a long way since his days as the relatively unknown replacement for Nicholas Colasanto on CHEERS.

Astonishing! Humans are being infected by a virus that affect speech, those that aren't sick are at war with those that are. Caesar is at the centre of all this, he is a 'Moses' figure, his motivation is to free captured 'slave' apes from the human camp and lead them all to safety, there are many other religious references and holocaust related images. And you can't help drawing comparison with some scenes lifted from Apocalypse Now. I can appreciate a film with s revenge theme, so was engaged almost immediately. 'Bad Ape' is a new comedy relief character and scene stealer. 'Nova' is a new young speechless human girl character, she has an important role, it takes time to understand her significance.

Rise and Dawn are great films, but War needs to end this trilogy perfectly, which is a very rare achievement in the history of cinema (i.e. the third movie of a trilogy to be the best) ... Well, War for the Planet of the Apes does what Return of the King did 14 years ago and it is the best film in this memorable reboot and one of the best (probably THE best) of the year!I can't find a single flaw with this movie. I really thought about every detail and there's only ONE thing that I can see others maybe faulting the film for it, which is some of the second act's pacing. Some new characters are introduced along the way and there is a period of time that some people mind find slow or boring ... For me, that's character development in its glory and it's also a massive build-up to a fulfilling climax in the third act.Don't be fooled by the title nor the trailers, you have to manage your expectations: this is not a war film. This is not an epic battle between humans and apes, which is something that I love about this movie: I didn't watch a single trailer, so I went totally blind into the theater. I assumed that I was going to watch an epic fight just by the beginning of the film, but it plays out in such an unconventional and emotional way that I found myself floored. It's jaw-dropping.Andy Serkis, man ... I don't even know what to say. The team that adds the visual effects to the apes are unbelievably talented ... There are so many close-ups of apes' faces and it's impossible for someone to say ""they're fake"" because they're not! They are so perfect that's impossible for me to look at them and not see a real ape. Andy Serkis deserves a freaking Oscar nomination as well as everyone in the motion capture team. It's unreal the amount of realism that they can pull off.Caesar continues to be the most powerful and emotional character that I've met since God knows how many years ago. He has a roller- coaster journey in terms of his feelings and I could definitely feel it: in his eyes, in his face, in all of his expressions and movements. It's a character that just became unforgettable and fortunately, he has a beautiful story about him and his journey told in three amazing films.Maurice (Karin Konoval) is one of my favorite characters from the trilogy and he gets some well-deserved scenes where he absolutely shines. The new characters are superb: Nova is portrayed by the spectacular Amiah Miller and Steve Zahn plays Bad Ape. She adds an astounding amount of depth to the story without saying a single word and she's able to be so compelling and captivating that when the emotional scenes go down, she elevates them to a whole other level. Bad Ape is where all could have gone wrong since he's the comic relief character in a very profound drama ... It works. Matt Reeves is able to guide this character perfectly, introducing him as a joke in just the right scenes and in just the right amount. One of the things that I faulted the other movies for was that the human characters didn't have that much interest and that I always wanted to be with Caesar. This time, the Colonel is someone that is given a very heartfelt story (even if it's through an exposition scene ... the ONLY one that I can count throughout the whole film), so when the third act begins I actually cared for Harrelson's character.Once again, the visuals are stunning, the film just looks amazing. However, the detail that makes this movie go from great to epic is, as always, its score. Michael Giacchino probably produced his best score to date and it elevated the film in such a powerful way. Most of the runtime, there's no dialogue (either there's sign language or pure silence), so the score had to be perfect in order for the scenes to be more complete ... and it is. I already added it to my Spotify playlist and I can't wait to listen to it over and over again. If some scenes are already emotional enough, this score turns them into something that I couldn't hold my tears from. More than once.The ending is so filled with emotion (I have no idea how many times have I written ""emotion"" or ""emotional"", but it's the perfect word to describe this film) that makes it the best ending to a trilogy that I've seen since The Return of the King (The Lord of the Rings). It's such a powerful and fulfilling moment ... Honestly, after some research, I have no problems saying that this is the best reboot EVER done to a franchise since Nolan's The Dark Knight.So ... I think it's pretty obvious ...War for the Planet of the Apes gets my first A+ of 2017! Go watch it! Now!

The first three are the only ones with any notable screen time. We see the sergeant maybe a minute total only because he is marching a column of troops twice, thus you notice who is at the head of the column. There are basically 2 groups of soldiers. You can throw out the later as they are hearing HAZMAT suits. This leaves the white female soldier. There may have been 2 but you see her so briefly in the sea of while male soldiers that if I blinked twice I never would've seen her at all. They lingered in her just long enough for me to notice she was a woman. Hard to tell with solider haircuts.",War for the Planet of the Apes
114,MrDHWong,"Concludes the ""Apes"" reboot trilogy on a powerful, yet appropriate note",9,27 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is the sequel to 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and the third installment in the Planet of the Apes reboot film series. Directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield and ""Dawn""), this third and final chapter in the continuing saga of Caesar the ape is easily one of the best conclusions to a film series ever made.Five years after the events of ""Dawn"", Caesar's (Andy Serkis) ape clan are now fighting off the members of a human resistance group known as Alpha-Omega. The leader of the Alpha-Omega is the mysterious Colonel (Woody Harrelson), a cold and bitter man bent on wiping out apes and re-establishing humanity as the dominate species on Earth. After the apes suffer major losses from constant battles against Alpha-Omega, Caesar decides to move them out across the border to a nearby desert, where he and the apes can live peacefully without any danger posed by humans. Along the way, Caesar, who is still haunted by what the rogue ape Koba told him years ago, starts questioning his own sense of morality and tries to come to terms with his inner animal instincts.With eye-popping visuals, great action, and touching moments of drama, War for the Planet of the Apes effectively concludes the ""Apes"" reboot trilogy on a powerful, yet appropriate note. Topping ""Dawn"" was a tall order, but ""War"" definitely succeeds in just about every way. The CG effects were all highly convincing and seem to have improved drastically after each film. As was seen in the previous two films. Andy Serkis is outstanding as Caesar the ape. Forget Gollum from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, this is the role Serkis should be remembered for. Woody Harrelson also gives a convincing performance as the Colonel, almost as though he is channelling Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. Long time fans of the franchise should keep an eye out for some clever inside references to the other Planet of the Apes films, some so subtle they're hard to pick right away.I rate it a solid 9/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
115,Alexander_Blanchett,The peak of Andy Serkis,8,16 August 2017,"I loved the two prequels and really liked this third part. The story starts in the middle of the great war between apes and humans. You are thrown right into it. It is built up like a Vietnam war film just that it is between humans and their creations. The animation gets better with each film and I think in this part it is just as good as it could get. Awesome and absolutely photo realistic. But beyond all that great Motion Capture is Andy Serkis' performance. He gave his best performance of the entire Ape trilogy. And if his role was a human without any CGI this would be a shoe in for Best Actor at the Oscars. Tremendous work, so many emotions, so real. Also it is character development at its best. I hope the Academy opens up for performances like that. As good as Woody Harrelson was, especially during his big scene, he never came close to the work of Andy Serkis. Also Steve Zahn gives a very good motion capture performance and Amiah Miller was very charismatic. The cinematography was amazing and so was the score. I think the only little, but really very little flaw was the pace. I mean it was extremely excited and quite twisted but somehow I missed the developments outside of Ceasar. Of course the focus was on him but I really hoped they would go more beyond that. Also the Christian and Nazi metaphors felt a bit drawn out. But those are just minor flaws and the only reason why I liked the first two films slightly better. Still it is possibly the best summer blockbuster of the year.",War for the Planet of the Apes
116,cliftonofun,More than a typical blockbuster,7,27 December 2017,"This film is anything but a typical blockbuster. I mean, it is a story told almost entirely via CGI characters communicating with sign language. And yet...it is remarkably human. I could have lived without the sermonizing villain whose plan made little sense (""Allow me to state what I'm doing in detail before making irrational choices""), but this trilogy definitely improved with each chapter. That wasn't about the people or the action - it was about the apes. You couldn't help but care about them and their relationships. So the storytelling wasn't perfect, but it clearly wasn't half bad either.",War for the Planet of the Apes
117,Laakbaar,"OK, but not as satisfying as I was hoping",7,18 October 2017,"This is the ninth PotA movie, and the third of the more recent Chernin-produced reboots (Rise 2011, Dawn 2014, War 2017). IMHO, Rise has been the best of the three. War is very similar to Dawn, in that it finished the story about Caesar.The hallmark of this reboot is that we cheer for the apes now. What keeps it all going is the thrill of seeing realistic intelligent apes, and this film is no different. The CGI is superb. I think the high scores reflect the enjoyment that audiences get from seeing this CGI artistry. After a while, you simply forget that it's not real and focus on the story.I didn't find this one to be as good as Rise or Dawn. The apes are an interesting lot, but they didn't blow me away this time. There were too many of them, I suppose. I didn't feel connected to them. The villains here are not yahoos and hotheads, but crazed, plague-infected humans. The humans are all soldiers and they live in fortresses and are armed to the teeth (an American view of a post-apocalyptic Armageddon). The theme is oppression, brutality, militarism, and so on. Nasty human stuff. This is a dark movie with too much violence for my taste.I wish the series had slown down and maybe gone somewhere else in this movie. Europe? China? But this is the last in the Caesar trilogy and I suppose they had to play that out. It was interesting to see the situation getting closer to the Planet of the Apes we saw in 1968. Humans are falling mute.There were a few plot problems with this one. The biggest one for me is that the simian society can rise so far, and human society sink so low, in such a short space of time. It's happening too fast. Not enough time was spent by the writers in figuring out how that would have played out realistically. The first movie in this reboot did seem vaguely realistic, and I liked that.Another problem is that the movie is not that verbal. I suppose this is necessary, but it's not an easy thing to pull off well. In hindsight, I don't remember any of the apes or their characters really. What are they going to do next? This was...well, a run-of-the-mill movie. It didn't soar for me. It was entertaining enough, but if you miss it, you wouldn't have missed much. It's worth about 7.5. I hope the next one is better.",War for the Planet of the Apes
118,trinaboice,Fantastic end to an impressive reboot trilogy,9,15 July 2017,"Grade: A-Rating: PG-13, 140 minutesIn a Nutshell: This is a war movie with all of the violence, explosions, strategy, suffering, beatings, prison camp, and human drama that the best war movies has.except that it also happens to have apes. This final installment in the reboot trilogy of Planet Of The Apes has incredible visual effects and plenty of heart to end the journey and story in an epic way.I watched the original series of Planet Of The Apes when I was a little girl and remember even attending a Movie Marathon at a theater that played them all back-to-back. I think the original film team would have been proud of this new versionand extremely impressed. ""Apes together strong!""Uplifting theme: Mercy vs. justice Revenge vs. forgiveness Family, friendship, loyalty Fear vs. loveThings I liked: If you have forgotten exactly what happened in the first two movies, the beginning of the movie gives you a clever, quick summary of RISE and DAWN to lead you into the WAR. There's only one other expositional scene, which makes for a very riveting movie without long scenes that have to explain to you what's going on and why. Andy Serkis is absolutely amazing. What an outstanding career he has had in bringing epic characters to life like Lord of the Rings' Gollum and now Caesar. He deserves every one of the awards he has won and been nominated for. The cinematography is stunning. Visually, it's a truly beautiful movie. The motion capture work is unbelievable. There is a blending of humans dressed as apes and real apes and you can't often tell the difference. In fact, you forget you're watching special effects when you see the apes move and talk. They're incredible. I love the small details, like blood vessels in the ape's unbelievably expressive eyes, fog coming out of the apes' mouths in the winter scenes, and ice crystals on the apes' fur. Speaking of the eyes, even Colonel exclaims, ""Look at your eyes! Almost human!"" ""Bad Ape"" (voiced by the lovable Steve Zahn) provides most of the comic relief. He was a scene-stealer every time. In a dark movie like this, ""Bad Ape"" could have been an awkward ""Jar Jark Binks"" figure that just didn't work, but instead, ""Bad Ape"" works very well. I got a kick out of carefully placed words that provided some humor like ""Ape-colypse Now"", and ""Bedtime for Bonzo"". It's truly rare that the third film in a series can measure up to the first or even the second, but this last edition in the franchise is excellent. Critics are referring to the script writing as a masterpiece, partly because it follows the old-fashioned model of storytelling. The score by Michael Giacchino was noticeably awesome. It kept up with the meat of the story extremely well. The green laser sequence was super cool. Directed by Matt Reeves, this film immediately immerses you into the ape world from the beginning. Woody Harrelson was fun to watch, as always. I love that this final installment in the story is so ape-centric. SPOILER: If you think about it, the end of the movie is a perfect set-up for the very FIRST movie in 1968. Interesting, right?Things I didn't like: It's a bit slow-moving. It's more of a thinking movie, rather than an action movie. A lot of dark, night scenes will make this hard to watch on your computer when it comes out on DVD and streaming.The Colonel makes some dumb decisions in regards to Caesar. The Colonel is worried about his race dying because of the apes, but ummm....where are all the women? Doesn't the lack of female humans pretty much end the human race? ha ha It always bugs me when the lines in the movie trailers are different from what's actually in the movie.Interesting lines: ""The irony is we created you and nature has been punishing us ever since."" – The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) ""There are times when it is necessary to abandon our humanity in order to save our humanity."" – The Colonel ""I saved myself."" – ""Donkey"" gorilla ""Is there anything left of you to save?"" – Caesar ""I am like Koba. I can't escape my hate."" – Caesar ""I did not start this war..I fight only to protect apes."" – Caesar ""I may not make it back."" – Caesar ""That's why I'm coming.to make sure you do."" - Maurice (Karin Konoval) Interesting that he's voiced by a woman, right?Funny lines: ""Oh no! OK."" - Bad Ape ""You're probably not much of a reader."" – Colonel to CaesarTips for parents: There are bodies of dead humans and apes throughout the entire movie. A lot of the monkeys use sign language, so there are a lot of subtitles kids will have to read quickly. There is a lot of violence, including frequent and bloody beatings.Take another look at the first two parts of the story: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Rise Of The Planet of the Apes @trinaboice",War for the Planet of the Apes
119,bheadher,There is something definitely wrong...,7,29 December 2017,"...but it isn't really with the movie itself. As a POTA movie, it stands out as the continuation of a story line...so that is good. If anything was wrong, it may have been having the humans treat the apes as humans. That did kind of detract from the over all experience.But Caesar is true to form, all the way through...he has that constant inner struggle with his human upbringing to deal with. He doesn't really hate the humans, but has to fight them...when so mny of his ""tribe"" are shot, tortured and humiliated, Caesar kinda loses his way, and that is the basis of the whole movie, really...So I found this outing to be quite good, in keeping with the other two installments.

120,kaefab,The main issue with this movie,6,1 October 2017,"Problem with the movie is not the CGI or the story, even if its paper thin, the length of the movie.The movie is way to long for what it as to tell, and where people get bored i guess and stop paying interest its because its to damn long in the prison camp.The movie is 2h18 minutes but there is less then nothing happening in the prison camp and the end battle was boring, could have been so much better.I guess its where all the hate comes from.",War for the Planet of the Apes
121,davidgee,"Good apes, bad humans (yawn)",5,25 July 2017,"Not a lot to say about this. There's a limit to how much magic today's over-done CGI can inject into to a franchise that's run out of steam. Caesar (Andy Serkis), the thinking man's King Kong, takes the last band of apes to a mining colony run by the vicious Colonel Woody Harrelson, where Caesar's son is among the prisoners. The war is not just between the slave-apes and their masters (humans and 'collaborator' gorillas) but also between the colony and another army of humans who've survived the apocalyptic virus.There are pleasing nods to other movies outside the genre. Some early snowscape panoramas reminded me of David Lean's awesome cinematography in DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, and the prison colony is a cross between Mad Max's THUNDERDOME and Kurtz's jungle hideout in APOCALYPSE NOW. Woody Harrelson's 'transition' from monster to misfit makes no sense, and the humanity of the 'good' apes contrasted to the inhumanity of the humans is ladled on much too thickly. The sequels to the 1968 Charlton Heston PLANET OF THE APES became progressively dafter, so we must hope they shelve the franchise back in the studio archive for a decade or two now that this remake trilogy is complete.",War for the Planet of the Apes
122,PyroSikTh,A Drama like the other Apes movies - Not a long Action Sequence,8,18 July 2017,"The first thing to make clear is that the marketing for War is slightly off. Just because it has ""War"" in the title, and the trailers are jam-packed full of grand action sequences, doesn't mean it's just a series of Ape v Human battles strung one after the other. In fact it's quite the opposite. There's a skirmish that opens the film, and the large-scale battle at the end (between two human factions), however the middle is more of a revenge tale with holocaust allegories thrown in. If you go into War expecting a full-on action movie, you'll be disappointed and bored, guarantee it. If you go into it as a fan of Rise and Dawn, you'll know that there's more to these movies.War picks up two years after the events of Dawn, with the apes on the run, and the human army mentioned at the end on their tail. As a new place to settle, far away from the military's grasp, has been found, the Apes plan a mass migration. Unfortunately things don't quite go to plan, and Caesar is cast on a journey of revenge, accompanied by franchise stalwarts Maurice and Rocket, as well new gorilla Luca.For a first in the series, and arguably a necessity this time around, War can also be pretty funny. The introduction of Bad Ape not only offers some strong hints as to where the franchise can go from here, but he's also used as comedic relief really well. He had the theatre in the laughter on a few occasions, but it never felt out of place or unnatural.It's not all perfect though. My biggest problem with the movie was the very last moments before the credits rolled. But another minor niggle I had was Caesar's speech. It was used sparingly and effectively in the first two movies, pointing out moments of significance and adding more weight to what was actually being said. In War though, he pretty much talks the whole time. With Koba gone, he was the only Ape left with extensive experience of human language, and so the only one that could talk. So why he talks to his apes almost all the time is beyond me. It reaches peak illogicality when he continues to talk to other apes while in stealth. Surely if you're trying to be quiet and sneaky, and can communicate with sign language, that would be the obvious form of communication you'd use, right? Apparently, Caesar's not as smart as he's meant to be.Visually War is at least on par, if not an improvement on the previous movies. With every passing year, the art of motion capture technology continues to advance and develop, and War is a fantastic demonstration of that. Caesar, Maurice, Rocket, Luca, Bad Ape, and every other primate featured is a massively impressive piece of work. They don't even look CGI'd at all, to the point where I swore they were using animatronics for some scenes (maybe they were, I honestly couldn't tell the difference). There's one moment in particular where we get a close-up of Maurice's face and his expression, and it's the most delicate, perfect marriage of acting performance and computer-generated imagery.On which note the acting in War is incredibly top-notch, maybe even the best of the series. Andy Serkis bows out of the role of Caeser with an incredibly conflicted, moving, and profound performance. You can see his struggle, his rage, his sadness in his face. And his body movements in Ape form are perfect. Karin Konoval's performance as Maurice is just as great as well, showing a tenderness and wisdom so synonymous with his character since Rise, but never really given too much focus. Steve Zahn deserves praise for managing Bad Ape's humorous moments with a seriousness of tragedy that helps the gags not feel out of place in a fundamentally serious and sombre movie. Woody Harrelson also owns the show as The Colonel, and his scenes opposite Serkis are tantalisingly good.The music I feel added a hell of a lot to War's charm as well. I've been disappointed with Michael Giacchino's work recently, as he kept turning in hugely dull and forgettable scores for his movies. The score he's written for War though is possibly the best score he's ever written. It's jam-packed full of emotional weight all by itself, emphasising every scene it's used in in the film itself. A certain recurring piano line is sure to have you welling up with tears before anything even happens, adding a sombre atmosphere to the whole movie. For his more bombastic pieces, he employs a lot of orchestral drums and percussion, along with woodwind instruments you might expect to hear in the original movies from the 60s or 70s. Often the score feels like a homage to those older movies all by itself, and it works fantastically. It's definitely the best score of the franchise, if not one of the top contenders for the whole year.War for the Planet of the Apes unfortunately doesn't shine a light on it's Reeves- predecessor - Dawn is still a masterclass for the franchise - but it's certainly a good follow-up that keeps up it's tone and narrative direction. It's more drama than it is war, but the two bookend action sequences are large and intense enough that they more than make up for it's slower middle. Not that the slower middle is a complaint. I feared it would devolve into a Return of the King-type trilogy closer where half the movie is just one massive battle sequence. Instead I was gifted with something much more emotional and intelligent. That said, it is the only one of the franchise so far that had moments I actively found frustrating. The very end being the movie's biggest offence. I give War a solid, yet imperfect 8/10.",War for the Planet of the Apes
123,pilot1009,disastrous finale,1,15 November 2017,"After the first 2 movies expectations were high, unfortunately this weak sadly non story episode is beyond the pale.There is no engagement with the characters, no real plot, no good guy in the human side, no mitigation of characters. Basically apes are good attacked and abused by warlike humans and eventually escape and make good. That's it.

124,Offworld_Colony,"Rife with cliches and clunky expository dialogue and yet in the ways that video games can be vibrant and exciting when retreading old ground,",6,17 February 2020,"WFTPOTA shares and revels in the Reuleaux triangle of tropes of the neo revenge westerns, family dramas and war/spy yarns.It's a surprisingly affecting emotional piece. Reeves uses Andy Serkis' superior acting and the location and set work to tell most of his story for him, which is the best thing to do when faced with what should by all accounts be a laughably absurd premise in a script written by Level 7 hack Mark Bomback.Some of the shots and the mocap can look sublime and flawless. The uncanny valley vaunted over by creating things close to human but not human. Reeves takes the western genre's love of close ups and pushes the facial CGI to the nth degree. It can be a magical effect at times.There's a torrent of new information thrown at the audience to cleverly prevent boredom, Zahn's slightly OTT Bad Ape being a good example of this. But just as it gets creepy and interesting, just as the red herrings begin to peak, the film gets bogged down in a myriad of conveniences and logic leaps. The film's concentration camp/great escape scenes seem to drag; with no particularly interesting character dynamics, no link between enemies, really. Harrelson is ok to watch, but he's no Brando.A strength is some of the bait and switch, we saw some pretty good Wars in Second POTA. So making the ""war"" between two human factions and playing the sides off of each other and instead using the effects of war (oppression and slave labour etc.) was a good twist.There are some irritating inconsistencies, such as someone understanding sign language while also looking away from them through binoculars, and spring flowers that somehow bloom in the dead of winter just for an artificial film moment to be drummed up minutes later was a hard swallow. And I know it's shorthand they would have maybe taught him in the first film, but Caeser using word wife is quite jarring to me.But the flaws of WFTPOTA are all overshadowed by a great character drama that borrows from a lot of the best examples of the genres it loves including even a dash of Spartacus. It's absolutely some of the best examples of facial and performance capture.But an emerging crutch of the series is that the humans eventually have to die out. So even though this is a slightly diminishing but solid, above average blockbuster, it's marred or even handicapped by the fact the humans always, on masse, will have to be an antagonistic and faceless evil.",War for the Planet of the Apes

It was a bit long and dragged a little in the middle, but not by much, and not enough to lower the rating, for the most part it was paced very well.

After the first two installments of this franchise, the near perfect expressions and movement of the apes is no surprise, but this is now only a part of the illusion. The story, cinematography and music also do their impressive part to seduce the audience into a moment by moment identification with the apes that is at times sublime. My only caveat might be that most of this movie will go over the head of anyone too immature or hardheaded to grasp its beauty. It's emotional and somewhat more subtle than the other movies in the trilogy, but in a lot of ways, far more satisfying.

128,LloydBayer,War is a terrific yet atypical blockbuster and a fitting swansong to the Apes trilogy.,9,12 July 2017,"I made a bold statement while reviewing 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes by calling that film the evolution of cinema. And before that I called 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes a ground breaking vehicle in cinematic storytelling. Yet both films asked the same question – will xenophobia lead to the destruction of humanity? In fact, this very question was initiated as a social metaphor in the 1968 original starring Charlton Heston. Now 50 years down the line, returning director Matt Reeves has the answer, and it's a fact we've known since the beginning of civilization. Touted as the finale to an epic trilogy, War for the Planet of the Apes is not your typical tent pole summer film. But it's all about computer generated apes, you say; Apes that talk in a setup that's all implausible science-fiction. Yes, and so are superhero films. And while we were sheepishly distracted by wondering which superhero character will get his/her own sequel, the Apes franchise was shaping out to be a rare Hollywood triumph in more ways than initially perceived. While Rise was a runaway hit in 2011, its story was about humanity's unintended conflict with a new race of super intelligent apes. Dawn in 2014 intensified that conflict before concluding that however hateful humans can be, peace is always an option. That little chance of peace is thrown out the window with War for the Planet of the Apes. Thus begins a visually stunning effects driven Hollywood blockbuster, and it doesn't get any better than this. Thanks to the breathtaking motion performance technology, anyone watching this film will have no doubt that the apes in this film are anything but computer generated creatures. The visuals are that good, if not the best in the franchise. Yet at the core is a strong emotional tug that transcends general expectations of a blockbuster this big. Take for instance that the terrific yet intense action scenes in this film are dispensed with controlled measure in favour of a richer and layered complexity in the storytelling. While it would have been all too easy to place apes on one side and humans on the other and light a fuse in between, Reeves concludes this trilogy with a poignant yet prophetic and equally poetic ode to humanity's self-inflected destruction. And personifying this dark heart of mankind is Woody Harrelson as a Colonel who has abandoned his ranks to exterminate apes led by our beloved Caesar. That very line, in a film pitting humans versus apes is exactly how the audience will react by rooting for another species instead of our own.Harrelson's Colonel (with more than enough homage to Marlon Brando's Col Kurtz in the still haunting Apocalypse Now) is a scary portrayal of just how ruthlessly pathological humans can be in endangering another species, or for that matter, another race of humans. While that is already known, the greatest achievement in War for the Planet of the Apes is in the innumerable social allegories that lead up to the climactic Caesar Vs Colonel showdown. It's worth the wait and the wait is not plagued with the usual bloating of a blockbuster pushing past two hours. Yet even as the story goes from grim to bleak, Steve Zhan as a chimp calling himself 'Bad Ape' injects some much needed humour. But if there is anyone who deserves top credit for this film (and the previous two), it is none other than Andy Serkis in another outstanding delivery as Caesar. No matter however accomplished, not many actors today can do what Serkis does, which is nothing short of breathing life into a digitally rendered character and then making you shed a tear over that character. While it's still a long shot in getting an Academy Award nomination for a motion capture role, what Serkis has achieved is not only colossal for this film but also for the future of cinema. That being said and irrespective of how well this film does during awards season, Serkis along with Reeves have crafted one of the most memorable films of the year. And if this is the series swan song, it is also one of the most heartbreaking and fully accomplished blockbusters of the year. All hail Caesar!",War for the Planet of the Apes
129,dcarsonhagy,Simply the Best of the Franchise,10,27 October 2017,"Believe it or not, I debated for a long time as to whether or not I was going to watch this. I found the original (in this genre's reboot) to be better than the original, but found its sequel to be simply boring, overrated, and almost unwatchable. And then, there's the third installment.I cannot believe how involved I became in this film. I found the writing, the story, the pace, the directing--everything--to be leaps and bounds above the other two films. The casting for this film was perfect. What really blew me away, though, was the actual story. Everything is tied up and all questions answered in the third chapter. What's even more amazing is it all makes sense! When the film opens, the humans are trying to flush out Caesar and his minions. After years of battle, it seems a certain faction of the humans have found a Messiah; someone who will lead them to the retaking of their land. Known only as ""The Colonel,"" and delightfully portrayed by Woody Harrellson, I cannot think of too many characters on film I have despised more. On his way in search of The Colonel, Caesar begins to discover something may not be right in the community of humans.Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and torture, this is one of the best films of this year. I highly recommend it.",War for the Planet of the Apes

As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the colonel are pitted against each other in an epic battle that will determine the fate of both of their species and the future of the planet.Let me start of by saying that if the action was the main reason you liked Rise and Dawn, this movie is not for you. It contains some well done action but it is a drama film first and foremost. If you accept the movie for that(and have watched Rise & Dawn), I imagine you will love this movie.Let's start with the story. War is a deep, dark, harrowing story about what humanity will do to save itself. That is a deep question for a movie about talking apes. It asks the audience if they would give up their humanity, to save humanity and that is powerful stuff. It is a genuinely harrowing question that I adore this movie for addressing. The ending for this movie is beautiful and poetic. It is the perfect end to a great trilogy. I will not spoil the ending but just know it is a very emotional experience that combines the harrowing questions of what is humanity with the spectacular buildup coming off Rise and Dawn. The writers of this trilogy could literally just have dumb plots that give us an excuse for apes to fight. They COULD do that but they don't. Each movie has given us a great, thought provoking story and making it the primary focus for this movie was a dangerous risk which I am pleased to say payed off. The overarching arc for this trilogy story wise has been excellent and is very rewarding for people who see the movies one after each other. I have NO complains with the plot and script for this movie; it is excellent.One more note on the dialogue. There is a chilling monologue from Woody Harrellson near the midpoint of the movie. It serves as an exposition dump, which is annoying, but the way they handled it makes me not care in the slightest. I got goosebumps on my arms from the writing of that one scene(you'll know it when you see it) and that is something I must praise the stellar crew behind this movie for.I've said it once, I've said it twice. I'll say it one last time, Academy. Give Andy Serkis a god damn Oscar. He deserves it! His performance throughout these movies is realistic in portraying an ape, and also a brilliant achievement in making an ape show emotion. Serkis has proved his worth multiple times and it is about time we show him he is appreciated. As much as I loved Hugh Jackman in 'Logan', Serkis deserves the Oscar. And unless something else comes out this year which sways my opinion, I will stand by it.My, and pretty much everyone,'s primary criticism with Rise and Dawn was the exceptionally weak human characters. This film changed that. Woody Harrellson gives a powerhouse performance as The Colonel and made him a terrifying villain. I don't quite agree he was better than Koba(Toby Kobell) but Koba had more time to develop and I think that was the reason he has the edge. I've mentioned the brilliance in the writing that made that monologue great but it was also Harrelson's performance. He gave me the chills and that is impressive. The most scary thing about The Colonel, however, is, well two things but they go hand in hand, the fact he remains nameless, and the fact I understand his point of view. Not giving him a name makes him more scary because it means that it could be any one person. It doesn't blame someone specific and it implies that anyone could become him given the circumstances. Giving him understandable motives also relates to this because it genuinely makes me question my own morality and humanity and makes me think what I would do in the situation he was in. It is rare a movie villain can do that and I truly applaud the film for that. The Colonel's end was also fitting and expertly handled.Karin Konoval has been consistently good throughout the entire trilogy. Steve Zahn's Bad Ape had the unfortunate job of the comic relief. He had to be funny and stupid but not to the point where he was annoying and obnoxious. And Zahn pulled this off expertly. I never disliked Bad Ape and consistently found him funny. He was a welcome addition to the film.The cinematography for this movie is breathtaking. I was gobsmacked for one very specific sequence in this movie towards the end, purely because of how beautifully it was shot and edited. The entire trilogy has been consistently impressive to look at cinematography wise but this film takes the icing on the cake in that department.If this franchise is robbed of ONE MORE best visual effects Oscar, I will lose my mind. The fact that the visual effects team can transform human being into living, breathing apes need to be commended. It is visually stunning and the CGI is flawless. This is a technical marvel on the same level as The Jungle Book. Yeah, I went there.All in all, War for the Planet of the Apes is a change of pace from the previous two installments but that does not mean it holds any punches. The minuscule amount of action used was great but I'm glad they committed to a drama story. If you accept this film as a drama, not action film; you will love it a lot more. And if you haven't seen Rise or Dawn, watch them before this movie. You will get the most enjoyment possible that way. I'll rate this movie a flawless 10 BAD APES out of 10!",War for the Planet of the Apes
131,room102,Incredible CGI,5,27 July 2017,"* I put a spoilers warning although I don't think that any of them actually spoils the movie *Let's start with the good stuff: The CGI. Absolutely incredible. Technology has reached a level you simply can't trust what you see anymore. The apes rendering is just flawless and it's done in nearly every frame of the movie. It's only the movement that seems slightly off at times. It's worth seeing this movie at the cinema just to appreciate the level of achievement of the CGI on the big screen. IMO it deserves an Oscar for visual effects.I liked this sequel better than the previous one. It's not as good as the first in the new trilogy, but it's surprisingly dramatic and emotional. While there's plenty of action, those scenes are there to serve the plot and dramatic parts, not just action for the sake of action.Having said that, the movie is not without its shortcoming. First of all, like all blockbusters nowadays - it's way too long. It should have been 20-30 min shorter. The plot itself, like I said above, is quite emotional and dramatic at times but something is missing for me, the story is quite simple and missing some more elements.There are plenty of references to the original 1968 movie and - like in Rogue One - an attempt to explain some elements seen in the original movie (especially why the humans can't talk) and perhaps tying the end of this movie to the beginning of the original movie (although the latter takes place in a much further future).Also, there are plenty of references to APOCALYPSE NOW.All the actors are very good in their roles: Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson, Steve Zahn (Bad Ape), Amiah Miller (the girl) and Karin Konoval (Maurice).All in all it's a pretty good movie.Worth watching",War for the Planet of the Apes
132,ericrnolan,"A short review of ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (2017)",8,27 July 2017,"Like the two films preceding it, ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (2017) is an intelligent, well rounded science fiction thriller. The newest ""Apes"" series has been leagues ahead of the campy late- 1960's original films, and of course Tim Burton's bizarre 2001 remake.There is more going on here than a simple ""apes vs. humans"" tale. Nor does it engage in simplistic moralizing, in which the innocent animals must escape from their human oppressors. There's a hell of a lot of moral complexity — something noted by the many positive reviews for the film. One of the things that I liked the most was a compelling new surprise plot element, even though it approaches deus ex machina territory. I won't spoil it here, but it's bleak, it's frightening, and it makes you think. Given the new information one character explains to another  it's hard to say who is the bad guy, isn't it? How this plot element plays out is damned effective too.This movie also superbly renders non-human characters — both in terms of its smart script and its special effects (a combination of both CGI and human actors). I was greatly impressed at the detailed and lifelike facial expressions.The action sequences were well executed, too, and the film had an epic feel. (Although this would be a decent conclusion to a trilogy, filmmakers Matt Reeves and Martin Bomback have gone on record stating they wouldn't be averse to future sequels.)Still, I must confess that my attention sometimes wandered. I think the pacing was a bit off. It also didn't help much that the conclusion of the final action set piece was spoiled by one of the film's trailers. (What the hell were they thinking? Who makes these decisions? Was there any backlash from fans who didn't want advance knowledge of the film's ending?)Although this was an exceptionally well developed film, I just can't give an unusually high rating to a movie that didn't always hold my interest. I believe, therefore, that I'd rate this an 8 out of 10.",War for the Planet of the Apes
133,Mike_Devine,This 'war' is not the answer to ending this franchise,4,23 December 2017,"The final installment of this generation's 'Planet of the Apes' series - Matt Reeves' 'War for the Planet of the Apes' - is one that tried to capture the excitement of 2011's superior film 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes.' Unfortunately, what results is a dark, vengeful final chapter that, despite a few bright spots and good messages, is pretty disappointing.At the heart of 'War' is the ongoing war between humans and apes, which picks up shortly after the events that happen in 2014's 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.' The two sides are led by Caesar (reprised by Andy Serkis) and The Colonel (Woody Harrelson) - the latter of whom is much more militant and offensive than the former. The themes of revenge and retribution are constant, while forgiveness gets a much smaller piece of the pie. And while a development that happens right out of the gate is shocking and brutal, it sets the tone for the remainder of the film.There are themes within 'War' that we've seen before. Caesar is viewed as a proven leader, and has earned a following among his clan. In fact, he is pretty much akin to Moses as a leader among Israelites in Egypt, being subjected to the same treatment as others. But, as with most hero stories, Caesar does not give up, even though no one would have faulted him for doing so based on the challenges he must confront.In a film that is so heavily focused on CGI characters, a few human actors get to share the screen. Amiah Miller portrays Nova, a young girl who is unable to speak. Despite this fact, Miller adds another element to the film that helps soften a lot of the violence and strife. But this does little to turn the tide of the film as a whole.It's not groundbreaking, nor is it enjoyable. 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a below-average, underwhelming way to end what could have been a promising franchise.",War for the Planet of the Apes

The 3D in this movie was stupendous every second of the 3D was amazing. Woody Harleson was great acting in this movie like always.Parents this movie is really violent with a lot of war violence and brutal action so if you don't want your little ones to see this kind of movie then just wait till they get older but show it to them in 3D.

135,akshatmahajan,Brilliant,9,16 October 2020,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a great movie. There are a lot of heavy, dramatic sequences and I would say this movie compromises entertainment for meaningful content. Everything serves the characters and story. This movie has death, suffering, plight, heroism and empathy. The effects are astonishing..Apparently this movie requires an active viewer. A person actually has to show up, absorb the content of a film that will not pander to, ""give me action"" needs. It is surprising to me that the third film in this trilogy would improve so much on the previous two films.The music both blends in and adds to the drama/action. Beautiful camera work in interesting locations, and several unique characters. This movie is full of great character building, and all the big moments really land where they should.Overall, you should watch it for yourself and shouldn't believe in negative reviews. Those who gave negative reviews to this movie are those who wanted only fight/ action scenes and those who don't have knowledge of pure cinema.",War for the Planet of the Apes
136,coreyjdenford,Ape-pocalypse Now,8,11 July 2017,"This review of War for the Planet of the Apes is spoiler free**** (4/5)APES TOGETHER STRONG is the reigning mantra from the Apes series, this has always had two meanings one is that Apes fight together in packs as they do in the animal world, or it could be that Apes never betray each other. It was never a problem for this to show its strength throughout the series, in fact from the planning stage the rebooted series was pretty much flawless, well everything except the nomenclature which always had a problem. The first, Rise had the birth of Andy Serkis' Caesar and had his fight against the humans which inherited their rise, the second Dawn had his new ape soldiers taking on the humans to dawn a future war. Then of course there's the latest War for the Planet of the Apes which you can guess what happens from that title – it's a war between ape kind and humans.The problem shouldn't worry you though as just like any other last movie in a trilogy this is by far the best in this series. It's brimming with quality and colour, all thanks to the top notch special effects team making the apes look as real as possible along with real emotions and scares that they carry with them. Here, Caesar is looking very old and suffers from tiredness, thinking that war between mankind and ape-kind is over he wants to rest and have peace until he is forced into the biggest for his life with Woody Harrelson's war hungry Colonel, leading the apes to fight for their freedom.Although war is the main idea for the film director Matt Reeves returning to form from Dawn, changes the pace to add humanity which carries the emotion from the apes which was another problem in the others too but here it's been cleaned up, there are many spectacular humanizing moments, carried by timely emotional heft around Maurice (Konoval) and his silent human friend (Miller). Serkis is fantastic at carrying this emotion, thanks to Reeves' brilliant hand in direction that makes the perfect deviation between cold-hearted war and teary eyed drama and it's brilliant. Meanwhile, Steve Zahn's Bad Ape adds levity giving a sense of comedy to the serious tone, he's hilarious from his quick witted quips, through his consequences to the way he helps Caesar when he needs it most. For some this would be a slight problem but it's the brilliant switch between tones. The human characters are exceptional here, specifically Harrelson he's fantastic as the cold-hearted warmonger who hates ape kind and the disease that's left with them, he's a cold killer, however he has feelings too particularly in a storytelling section with him and Caesar which will get you balling. However, there is an escape attempt in a war fortress that feels slightly unwelcome but thanks to the fantastic performances and excellent characterization it can be shrugged away easily. Still, the third in the trilogy is an exceptional piece of filmmaking that rings with pure quality, colour and shining special effects and is by far the best in the series.VERDICT: Apes together strong. A fantastic end to the trilogy which is filled with excellent performances and top notch action, which despite the sudden drop still drives it forward.",War for the Planet of the Apes
137,eagandersongil,Evolution is born of war,8,8 August 2017,"In a movie market so confused, full of remakes, rebots, movies that are just to raise money, we have a certainty, the recent franchise of ""Planet of the Apes"" does not disappoint, it is almost a sigh in the middle of the year, the good blockbuster Is coming, and it is almost ironic that a movie about monkeys at war against humans can be the most natural thing in the cinema these days, and one of the franchises where we can better personify ourselves and society, disguised as a good popcorn, With an impressive motion capture, good performances and a good script, Matt Reeves finishes the trilogy by thrilling and enchanting the audience and leaving in the air a feeling of want more. The script that until now seems linear, but the same is complicated by introducing previously unknown elements of the franchise, elements that had everything to go wrong, but the opposite happens, serve and contribute to the unfolding of the plot. Behold the story of Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his troupe of monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees who, after confronting a battalion led by an evil colonel (Woody Harrelson), are eventually captured by him, the script follows linearity, but As I have already said, becomes less unpredictable and has very interesting ramifications, although it does contain some holes. ""Planet of the Apes-The War"" is not a story of good guys and bad guys, everyone is looking for survival there, even the figure of the colonel, he does not act for sheer evil, he really believes in what he does, Human race, and sees not only the monkeys as a threat, but also the infected humans, and the monkeys in question, are there solely and exclusively trying to survive and build a legacy, we could embody ourselves on either side. Technically the film tells a beautiful photo, even though it is a large part of CGI, it is extremely alive and almost touchable, we have forests, water, snow, mountains, earth, always with a dark film (less in the end that changes to a film Yellow and makes a reference to ""2001: A Space Odyssey""), we also have a great editing and mixing of the sound, an assembly that keeps the rhythm of the film constant and exciting even at two and a half hours, where we barely have dialogues Spoken, and of course, the high point, the capture of movements, is something completely frightening and makes the viewer sometimes lose the focus of the film to be admiring these details, the technology advanced, cezar became better, and now humanized, he is frighteningly incredible. And one of the great merits of Cezar being incredible in the movie is the actor Andy Serkis who does a job of acting, that even with all the technology in the world, without the human factor, Cezar would be empty, and Andy Serkis has to stop getting a quote Of the academy and start to win prizes, and an Oscar nomination for now !, Another one that is incredible in the film is Woody Harrelson, although being well-known face in the industry, Woody already has a face of villain to the natural, and here he is very well Used, and when the film ends you want to see more scenes of the colonel, because there are few, moreover, all other actors who made the monkeys are great, there is nothing to talk about in terms of acting. Matt Reeves now has a challenge with the new Batman movie, but the director has already proved to be a great director and knows how to use film technology to his advantage, making movies big and commercially profitable but at the same time quality. Reeves makes a film that tells the monkey odyssey and almost conceals the ""human-being"" element, at least physically, as it instigates us to impersonate these monkeys, is a film that uses a lot of sign language, contains few dialogues And even so binds the public, is a story of ascension, fall and peace. ""Planet of the Apes - The War"" is goodbye, at least for the next 10 years, because we know how the industry is ... anyway, it's a great movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes
138,kgprophet,Better Storytelling in the Summer Blockbuster Jungle,6,20 August 2017,"As I started to pickup the old western style of narrative (the hero's journey, sparse but brute dialogue), and the other obvious classic movie homages, I felt good about this film taking me for a different kind of ride than most of the rest of the summer movie fare. Andy Serkis and others have really perfected the motion capture process to the degree that you feel you are looking a genuine 'human' expressions on the CGI apes. The main character as an intelligent ape could almost make you think of John Wayne. The straightforward storyline benefits from avoiding any distracting side stories. Each main character is fully fleshed out, and the motivations are made clear. It is a thoughtful script that remembers the events that occurred previously, helps drive the actions of the characters. We are given bits and pieces of the bigger picture, as exposition is released slowly throughout the film. Armed military are trying to hunt down Caesar, the ape leader. It is a matter of survival that the population of apes find refuge from the deadlier weapons used by the humans. Enter the bad human, one that is also a villain to the other humans. Woody Harrelson is transformed into Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now. Complete with a cult of soldiers that will do his bidding. Without going into spoilers, the filmmakers borrow from ""Bridge over the River Kwai"" and ""The Great Escape"" to setup the three-way showdown between the apes, the bad humans, and the possible peaceful humans. I didn't find the Colonel character as compelling as his counterpart Marlon Brando. The setup for his evil views has a nice payoff. As necessary, the western-style hero must confront the villain, and Caesar has a permanent growl in his reaction to everything. Steve Zahn provides some good comic relief, and relative unknown Amiah Miller is a mute girl who shows that there is humanity and civility possible between the simians and the humans. She reminds me, quite physically of Dakota Fanning in 'War of the Worlds"". As this point you might guess that although this movie has good storytelling, it's not very original. But again, with a glut of nonsense movies with paper thin plots, WFTPOTA is very self-confident with the style of narrative it presents. I was contemplating during the the journey Caesar and his cohorts were undertaking, and knew if this was a ""Star Wars"" style of narrative, we would be jumping from the good humans to the bad humans and back to the apes every few minutes. This epic style of storytelling drives it past the 2 hour mark, but there is enough justification to allow it to transpire at the rate it does. Even so, the ending wraps up quickly and cleanly compared to some long goodbyes that an audience must endure in other epics.",War for the Planet of the Apes

And then a fortune in minerals was discovered just inches below the surface and, well, history repeated itself (and continues to repeat itself on an apparently endless loop to this very day in this company/country). Just a few nights ago, I happened to catch Andy Serkis on THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT and was shocked to see just how MUCH of the Actor bleeds through the cgi: we see Serkis, decked out in his cgi points-of-reference rig, reading from the script for WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES as he slowly morphs into Caesar. It's an amazing sequence, and I suggest anyone who questions (as I had) Serkis's contribution(s) check it out, post haste. (At one point, Colbert asked Serkis to read a couple of the infamous ""tweets"" of The Great Grifter, Don Trump, as Gollum. Hilarious.) For fans of the Apes movies, fear not: WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES isn't just another cgi video game writ Large: it's as dramatic and moving as the previous two entries and promises yet MORE to come (hopefully).

140,tankace,Great closing to an awesome trilogy. And promises,9,20 July 2017,"Having now watch and the newest film of this series I will start reviewing in a reverse chronological order very movie from the Planet of the Apes series up until the original. Now to our film we follow our tribe of apes as they are in conflict with the human due to the events of the previous film and their leader Ceasar as he fights to keep his family (both actual and more broadly speaking his tribe) and after the soldiers try to invade in his home he goes on his personal journey for revenge. What I love with this film is how real is the drama for this group ,which we now follow for six years in films and we have seeing to becoming a proper society. Also the effects are spectacular and at times you forget the these creatures aren't real but actors and actresses in tight costumes! The best of them is of course Ceasar who now is a grizzled leader and he is willing to do everything in his power to protect his family and if he fails avenge it with extreme prejudice. And this single mind approach is mention by his close friend Maurice ,the best Orangutan in film history, that is very similar with that of Kompa ,the chimpanzee who is partly responsible for this conflict.As for the humans, we don't get a lot of them, this a very ape-central movie(but we humans aren't also apes so again the previous films were ape-central...whatever). However their reason to continue this fight is revealed later and it makes sense for them to try their best to exterminate the apes. Also the main antagonist played expertly by Woody Harrelson is the kind of person that is willing to do anything to in his mind prevent apes form replacing humans as the dominate species. So his actions and words though show that he is of his rockets, they at least make him a believable person in that post- apocalyptic environment.Side note here if Andy Serkis doesn't get an Oscar nomination for his performance here I will go bananas on the committee. Sorry I had to write that for I don't understand why he hasn't an Oscar yet for his work in both her and the Lord of the Rings.As for cinematography ,pase and action great and beautiful just that I have nothing else to say truly the creating team has put a lot of work in this project. One thing that shows this attention to details is who the apes communicate with out actually speaking using just body language and sign language.Over all a great film and if the series ends here I will be satisfied and Apes Together Strong.",War for the Planet of the Apes
141,asb_deutsch,A true epic trilogy better than previous ones (Oscar deserving!),8,16 July 2017,"Rise of the Planet of the Apes was the one of the big movie surprises for me of that year. With staggeringly good motion capture for the apes and a touching story of Caesar and Co. it was a classic. What made me not notice that the apes were CGI!Next in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", we are caught in the feelings of man and mammals- though good but took a backward step, making it a little ""dawn"" and more ""war"".Finally, in ""War for the Planet of the Apes"", we get a thought provoking ""emotional"" script than action. The movie goes deep in the characters, especially Caesar.How many trilogies end with a successful second sequel/ third installment? To my perception, only Toy Story 3 and Bourne Ultimatum fits the puzzle. The conclusion is much better than LoTR, The Hobbit (old- fashioned ending) and even The Dark Knight Rises (Incoherent ending; I hope Nolan finds better luck in Dunkirk!). War of the Planet of the Apes with Spider-man: Homecoming can be labeled as June's best popcorn flick- duo. Verdict- A moment to rejoice! After a long time the critics are totally in sync with me. If you have a nice narration, you don't need 3D at all, which many people are complaining! My significant digit score: 7.9/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
142,DeBBss,Mixed Feelings...,7,19 July 2017,"I walked in this movie expecting a 10/10, but to me it wasn't. People on YouTube are giving this a 10/10, or saying it's the best in the trilogy, but I didn't feel that vibe, but it isn't a terrible movie, I just expected more.Story: 7/10This movie starts with a huge battle against the Humans, and the Apes which leads to an ambush by the humans on the apes, while their fighting, the colonel kills Caesar's wife and older son, which drives Caesar mad, and wanting revenge. The virus also mutated, and makes the humans more like wild animals then actual human. The story isn't really like an action movie kind of story, but more like a drama, there's more drama then action, and the movie's very depressing, if you were expecting action, then your going to get let down.Characters: 8/10Caesar: Caesar is pretty much the same, he wants peace, and he wants to protect apes, he ends up dying but I was expecting it.The Colonel: The Colonel feels very paper-thin, the movie does explain his past, and why the things he did, but I don't think he's a unique villain.Bad Ape: Bad Ape is a bit interesting, and he was supposed to be the comedic part of the movie, but every time there was a joke it wasn't funny.Maurice: Maurice was done good, Maurice is Caesar's best friend, I was expecting him to die, but I'm glad they didn't.Nova: Nova feels very unnecessary, she's the least important, she's just there to make the movie more dramatic.Rocket: Rocket is very under the radar, he doesn't feel like he made a difference, he's only important in the last act.Action: 6/10I feel like it's more of a drama then an action movie as I said before, it does have some action and amazing CGI, but you are going to get bored in the middle of the movie, War for the Planet of the Apes is 2h 20min long, and it feels like it drags so many times. The execution, and pacing feels off, But when there's action it gets very entertaining.War for the Planet of the Apes is a good movie, it succeeds as a drama, but lacks so much in action, but overall it was a good movie, they could have ended it a bit better, but I think it's a good ending to the trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes

144,gavinp9,Very fitting finale to an underappreciated trilogy,8,2 January 2018,"'War for the Planet of the Apes' is the eighth film in the franchise and does a great job of concluding the 'Rise'/'Dawn'/'War' trilogy of prequels, as well as linking this back to the original 1968 'Planet of the Apes', via Caesar's son being called Cornelius. Like 'Dawn', humans are almost secondary characters here, and when they are shown, they definitely make you back the apes, who have more humanity and compassion than the surviving humans.The CGI is now so believable, it's almost impossible to discern if there's any real apes in among the CGI ones! Caesar (Serkis) is so realistic in close-ups, you're basically looking at Serkis. He's great, and it's nice to see the added (digital) touch of grey to his coat. Caesar still has his three trusted right-hand apes with him, Maurice (Konoval), Rocket (Notary) and Luca (Adamthwaite). After the humans that have not been wiped out by the Simian flu, led by the Colonel (Harrelson), decide to attack the apes in the Californian forest, Caesar has to fight back to save all of ape-kind.There's a nice subplot with Nova (Miller), a young girl they protect, but the overall thrust is that the humans still think they're better than the evolved apes and treat them like slaves. There's a massive battle at the end and plenty of great action throughout. The overall pace is good, with it feeling a lot faster than 2 & ¼ hours. The addition of Bad Ape (Zahn) as some comedic relief is a masterstroke, but the film is so meaningful thanks to Caesar's love for his kin and his determination for them to survive.",War for the Planet of the Apes
145,shanayneigh,I hate every ape I see,5,7 November 2021,"It was not a bad movie, but two and a half hours to tell this fairly simple story was far too long. In the end it felt almost like a mix tape of other (and better) films like The Great Escape, Apocalypse Now and Bridge on the River Kwai to the point where it felt lazy. And I'm sorry, but I didn't really feel too much for the digital apes, especially the comic relief played by Steve Zahn which too me right out of the movie.One thing in the first few minutes made me laugh straight out. The human soldiers are sneaking towards ape camp, and spot some simians on horseback. One of soldiers pulls out a crossbow, presumably in order to kill that ape stealthily. The instant the bolt is fired, the humans start screaming and launch explosives towards the camp, making me wonder why they bothered with a silent crossbow at all.One thing doesn't make any sense at all. Woody tells Caesar a story about how he his son to attack some apes somewhere. Apparently they got too close to the apes and caught a mutated form of the virus, robbing the humans of their ability to speak. The virus then spread to the doctor etc. And Woody had them all killed in order to prevent the mutated virus from spreading further among his merry band of horrible guards with apparently zero peripheral vision. Very Colonel Kurtz indeed. Which makes one wonder why he first of all employs ape helpers, the ""Donkeys"", to work with the human soldiers. Second of all, why he captures apparently dozens of apes from the wild as his slave labor, even touching them himself without gloves (like he does with Caesar). If he's so worried about a virus spreading from apes to humans, why does he surround himself with a frakking sea of apes??",War for the Planet of the Apes

Looking at this through the context of the original from 1968, it's hard to know who to root for. The humans in this are horrible to the apes, but you think ""Well, they kind of deserve this, because they do the same thing to us in the original."" And yet you still sympathize with them. We're rooting for the bad guys and yet...we're not. The motion capture on the apes is amazing! Not since ""Avatar"" has there been such impressive effects. (Although I may redact that statement after I see ""Valerian"", but we'll see...) The detail on each ape is exquisite. If it weren't for the apes riding horseback and wielding guns, you would think this was a nature documentary. Woody Harrelson does a great job, although at some points it does feel like a repeat of his character from ""The Hunger Games."" As far as who to root for, it's hard to decide. Neither side is definitively good or evil. Some of the humans are horrible, but some just want to leave the apes alone, and have the war come to them. Some of the apes are even on the human side. The action sequences in this were way over the top (in a good way.) I honestly don't know how this film could be improved. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Most times I say ""I really enjoyed the movie except for this, this and this,"" but that didn't happen here. The emotion was so well conveyed. It makes you hate your own species and cry over a bunch of CGI Apes. Kind of ridiculous out loud, but it's so well written and acted, I wouldn't be suprised if this gets nominated for a few Oscars when awards season comes around.

Andy Serkis performs as an ape opposing the war- hungry people, while trying to save his own ""people"" in a struggle that is about victory for one group (humans) and peace for the other group (apes).Thanks to the brilliance of people like Andy Serkis and Terry Notary, this is not a movie about war, apes or post apocalyptic scenery, but about the search for humanity and survival. Humanity says nothing about humans, but about character traits that seem rare in humans and apes alike.The painful twist in this movie is that the humans fight to save humanity, but as the fight goes on, the apes gain humanity, and the humans lose it. Which is a not so subtle way to say that war never leads to peace and only leads to destruction. Destruction of the planet, life, and humanity itself.The message is strong, simple and effective. Humanity is not won by war, but by peace and standing together. This struggle is present between races, but also within.

152,kaptenvideo-89875,must be one of the most depressing of all the successful movie series of all time,5,1 August 2017,"Wouldn't like to sound like a party pooper, but Planet of the Apes"" surely must be one of the most depressing of all the successful movie series of all time. I do not consider shooting (or other kind of cruelty against) animals a fulfilling entertainment, even if it happens in a movie and the animals are extra intelligent apes who can fight back. I am often too lazy to follow movie franchises after seeing the first part, because I find most of them too boring and/or heartless. Despite that, I have seen all three Apes"" now. The experience has been kind of depressing, but also, in a way, good cinema. There's something weird and wonderful about seeing animals acting so expressive and human. This is what good cinema is all about – making us see the world in a new way, feel something (even bad), be ready to transcend beyond the usual borders and limits that we use to make our usual life less scary and more rational. So, despite being part of a franchise and all, the first two Apes"" movies (2011, 2014) managed to make me care, even if the quality of storytelling felt rather mediocre, especially in the part deux. I am sad I can not say the same about the third one, because War for the Planet of the Apes"" just sucks. It's boring, charmless sequel which has maybe 20-30 minutes worth of good stuff (mostly in the end). It does not really show war as promised in title, but there's also lack of action altogether, or heartfelt drama. They have a lot of mediocre story instead, and take their sweet 140 minutes to get there – aiming to create epic end to trilogy. Which doesn't even matter much because there has already been promise for future sequels. The first and second episode managed to gather 481,8 and 710 million dollars from cinemas, of course there's gonna be more! The biggest letdown must be the aim to turn the movie more into drama than action. But it is difficult to create a convincing full length dramatic story based on animals looking sad and worn-down – although it surely works with short-form web content such as videos, articles, memes, or photo series. As a result, the core of the movie felt like a parody of similar, mostly youth adult oriented takes on dystopian society and suffering, such as The Hunger Games"". It's shallow, soulless and sometimes just stupid – some big things happen because they are supposed to, rather than evolving naturally from the characters and their actions. In War"", there are exactly two characters than made me care about them, neither in the center of the story. Firstly, comic relief monkey performed by Steve Zahn. And secondly, a bad guy played by Woody Harrelson – easily the best thing in the whole movie. The character may not have been very intriguing on paper, but Harrelson's performance makes it most memorable, adding depth and powerful presence to otherwise limp story. As years go by, Harrelson (aged 55 now) has become a bona fide screen legend, a powerhouse actor so awesome that he owns almost every scene he appears in, no matter who or what he shares it with. He is a true master, and the only thing in War"" that feels magical, not soulless rehash. I know, the star of Apes"" should still be Andy Serkis performing as Caesar. But the character has become more and more one-dimensional over the course of the trilogy so I had trouble with caring about him at all in War"". Caesar's become something of a storytelling device by now, needed for advancing the story but not enriching it in real way. Most of the event manage to create so little emotional impact that when the finale started, I I already struggled to remember any good parts from before. But I liked the biblical"" ending very much. So, the trilogy has a pretty cool finale, at least!",War for the Planet of the Apes
153,williampsamuel,A Masterful Conclusion to the Apes Trilogy,9,6 May 2020,"You wouldn't expect pathos and deep personal drama from a movie about humans battling apes. In fact the trailers gave me the impression that this was where the series would go off the rails, replacing story and characters with explosions and effects. Thankfully I was very wrong. Beyond being an outstanding action blockbuster, War is a work of surprising complexity and depth, which successfully blends religious symbolism, painful imagery of slavery and genocide, and though provoking questions about the price of vengeance and what truly makes us human.For those who haven't seen the first two movies, it's been three years since conflict between the apes and the remnants of humanity began. In that time ape leader Caesar and his tribe have made every effort to avoid war, hiding ever deeper in the forests in the hope that they'll be left alone. In return they've been endlessly hounded by soldiers following the fanatical Colonel. Near the brink of destruction, Caesar decides the only hope for his beleaguered clan is to flee to a new land far away, while he deals with the Colonel once and for all. But of course the best laid plans of men and apes go astray, supping up a harrowing captivity and climactic final battle.Harrelson is in perfect form as the colonel, channeling Brando and adding his own natural insanity to create an antagonist very much like Col. Kurtz, only far more intense and aggressive. Personal loss and the fear of what humanity may become have driven him beyond the point of fanaticism, into utter ruthlessness and madness. He will use any means to achieve his ends; even killing his own men if he believes they pose a danger. His followers are as much a cult as an army, and he is like a prophet to them, preaching the gospel of salvation for humanity through the annihilation of the apes.Yet the Colonel is not the only flawed character in the movie. As Caesar continues on his quest, he's haunted by the memory of Koba, the villainous ape who started the war with humanity and died by Caesar's hand in the last film. Their clash came about because Caesar only wanted peace, while Koba was consumed by his thirst for revenge against the humans. But now as pursues his own vengeance, who must ask himself if he is becoming his old foe, and whether what he's doing is for the good of his tribe, or his own satisfaction.This question becomes more pressing as what was supposed to be a simple assassination becomes a rescue mission. Rather than kill all the apes immediately, the Colonel has imprisoned hundreds of them in what can only be described as a simian concentration camp where the captive apes are used a slave labor to build a wall that will complete the Colonel's defenses. The Holocaust imagery is striking and highly disquieting, especially in scenes where the captives are herded and beaten by fellow apes who are fighting for the humans. These ""Donkeys"" (presumably as in Kong) were followers of Koba, who fight for the promise that they will be spared, like Kapos in a Nazi concentration camp.These scenes are also unsettlingly similar to some from Roots and Twelve Years a Slave. It's a testament to the quality of the writing and direction that apes can be used as stand-ins for plantation slaves without it seeming even slightly racist. On the other hand the wall that the apes are building could be seen as an overly transparent political allegory, especially since it's at the border between two states. But then again it is a military fortification across the mouth of a box canyon; more like the wall at Helm's Deep than a monumental barrier to separate humans from apes. So make of it what you will.The apes meanwhile have their own human companion, a young mute girl they name Nova. Her presence is a fairly transparent ploy to make us relate to the protagonists, but it works, largely due to the young actress's wide facial acting range and sheer cuteness. And she may turn out to have more plot significance than we initially realize.Perhaps surprisingly for a movie this intense and frequently tragic, there is some excellent comedic relief, most of it delivered by Bad Ape, an escapee from a Florida Zoo who's gone a bit nutty from too many years of isolation. He's cowardly, eccentric, and always doing the wrong thing at the worst time possible, in the most endearing way possible. There's also something to be said for the mere presence of a mostly hairless ape in a ski vest.War for the Planet of the Apes delivers everything you could want from a summer action movie: great effects, spectacular battle scenes, frequent suspense, good comic relief, and even some smart pop-culture references. But more than that, it's a work of depth and nuance that will make you think, feel, and maybe bring an occasional tear to your eye. It ups the action and spectacle of its predecessors while remaining as thoughtful and character driven as ever, and is far more human than a movie about apes has any right to be.",War for the Planet of the Apes

It was a rough film to watch, very sad. But a beautiful film on all levels. Sometimes the most beautiful and existential films are the saddest too. Andy Serkis is incredible in this film and how he hasn't been nominated for an academy award is beyond me (but the AA is so polluted nowadays it isn't surprising. The AA sells out to the highest bidder).The reason this ape franchise is fantastic and amazing from the cinematography to the acting to the story to the music score is because of Matt Reeves. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was okay, but not great. But when Matt Reeves got involved with the franchise starting with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes that's when the franchise rose to a whole another level, not falling into the pitfalls of garbage franchises like almost everything else.

In them, the ape society mirrored human society, and there were good apes and bad apes. Watching those movies, you could see both the good and bad in people and apes, standing in for people.But the re-boot series of movies changes the social commentary - America bad, terrorists good.It's no accident or coincidence that the apes seek to travel to the desert where they will be free of the evil Americans who want the apes dead. After all, Hollyweirdos think the mad Muslim terrorists just want to be left alone, and they're fighting for their freedom against evil America.History shows that's not true, but Hollyweird leftists don't care much for real history.Early in the movie, the evil American colonel kills Caesar's wife and son. That's evil! It's portrayed as evil. Not long after that, Caesar kills a little girl's father. He never expresses a moment of sorrow. He never questions his own actions, even in light of just living through someone killing his family. But he's good.Get it? Desert people who use guerrilla tactics to fight the evil Americans - aka mad Muslim terrorists - are good. Americans who use military tactics to fight for their survival are evil.That's the movie in a nut shell. That message is wrapped in absurd battle scenes with apes fighting off well armed soldiers - rocket launchers, body armor, night vision goggles, instant radio communication - with the apes using home made smoke bombs, spears, and a few modern weapons.Ther's no ape violating ""ape must not kill ape"" in this movie.

157,darkreignn,One of the best films of 2017,9,9 January 2018,"Oh my God, what a movie. This is no doubt one of the best, if not THE BEST, movie I have seen in 2017. In my quest to review every ""Star Wars"" movie, I decided the next logical thing to do was to watch ""War for the Planet of the Apes,"" and I'm so happy I did.Advertised as a straight-up action flick, ""War"" is anything but. Yes, it opens with an amazingly directed action sequence where a group of human military combatants attack an ape base that is located in the deep words, but that is pretty much the only ""big"" action sequence until the very end of the film, and even then the action is more of a way to further the story rather than something thrown in there for the audience to marvel at and enjoy. Because of this, I can see why the user reviews for this film on IMDB are absolutely atrocious; 1/10 star reviews plague this movie, with a ton of people saying that this movie is ""insufferable,"" ""boring,"" ""nonsense,"" and ""one of the worst films I've seen in the cinema!"". The reviews among the general audience have been mixed, to say the least. People have said that this movie does not contain a war, that there is little action, and that the previous film had more of a war than this film did. My own cousin even said, ""that movie is not that good, it's actually pretty boring; they should've called it 'one battle for one small piece of the planet of the apes.'"" I would wholeheartedly disagree with every single criticism that has been thrust upon this movie.For one thing, this movie is a WAR in every sense. If the humans succeed in their goal of eradicating the apes, then the planet will once again belong to them. However, if the apes succeed in their goal of surviving and stopping the violence that the humans seem all too eager to engage in, then they will be able to survive and live in peace without worry of being slaughtered. Sure, there may not be set-piece after set-piece of violent combat, but there doesn't need to be; from the opening scene, the stakes are made explicitly clear as the humans trek through the woods with ""monkey killer"" written on their helmets.And when it comes to the killing, all of the action in this movie is filmed beautifully, artfully. The opening battle sequence left my jaw on the floor with its mixture of aerial and wide shots; everything was shown clearly, without any form of shaky camera. There is no doubt that the action in this movie is amazing, but just because this movie is not constant action from beginning to end doesn't mean that this movie isn't riveting from start to finish. I legitimately don't understand how, after watching the first 20 minutes of this movie, one would not be 100% engaged in the goings on of the film's world. Seeing Caesar's motivation for wanting to track down Woody Harrelson's character is truly heartbreaking and you can't help but root for Caesar to obtain his goal, but at the same time you do see where Woody Harrelson's character is coming from as a colonel.The acting and the CGI are of course, as with the previous 2 films, top notch. Woody Harrelson and Andy Serkis do an incredible job and both give emotional performances. Surprisingly, Amiah Miller also gives a subtle and sweet performance as a child who has lost the ability to speak. Everyone in this movie, whether they be ape or human, does a very good job and the CGI is so lifelike that you will honestly forget that you're not watching animals. I literally don't have a single bad thing to say about this movie, and because of that I am not sure why I am not giving this film a perfect score of 10/10. I adored this movie with all my heart, but I base my ratings out of my gut feelings, and my gut told me to score this film a 9/10, so that is my final rating. If I had to give a reason, I would say that this movie is not as good as the first two films of the trilogy, but it is no doubt a strong sendoff that I will always remember fondly, much like how I remember the first two movies fondly. ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is an emotionally resonant film and a fantastic ending to one of the best movie trilogies of all time. The clear and slick directing will captivate you as soon as the film starts, and Caesar's struggle for revenge while trying to keep hold of his humanity will keep you engaged until the very end; this movie is an action movie, but it is also a very human drama, which is ironic because the main characters happen to be apes.9/10 (Review available to read on my blog - if interested, please click on my account and follow the link to my blog!)",War for the Planet of the Apes
158,FallenEye,War or Warning for...,7,4 February 2018,"Two characters made me somewhat fall in love with this film and are a major reason as to why I'll round it off to a 7/10, them put together with the amazing CGI and some story that was withstanding. Nova and ""Bad Ape"" somehow nourished a connection for me. These two characters felt, real.From there, yeah, editing was at points, however not too many, was a bit choppy, and Giacchino's score was irritating in that it was at the cusp of being great, and kept missing it by a note.What happened to Ceaser's son and wife I somehow saw coming, however what happened to the Colonel was surprising. What I didn't like especially though, is how the apes escaped their cages; In my head I literally wondered: ""What if there are underground tunnels that lead into the cages"", but then also thought: ""Neh, that would be too easy, a cheat even"". Then, that's exactly what happened.Luca giving Nova the flower then dying minutes later was a bit forced, but like I said, I absolutely fell in love with Nova, so, it was easy for me to write that one off as a ""heartwarming moment"".Another problem is; there was really no war was there?! War for the Planet of the Apes and Logan are actually pretty similar. Prof. X and Maurice. Laura and Nova. Logan and Ceaser. Both movies you have X/Maurice caring for Laura/Nova. Both movies is a journey from one point to the next. Both movies have some level of extinction. Both movies, there is that, death.I mention this because people seem to believe Logan is amazing. For those that do, I feel either this movie too should be right up there for you, or perhaps not too far behind.This film was emotional and had characters worth caring about, but was also a bit all over the place and, didn't quite deliver how it could. 6.5/10.",War for the Planet of the Apes
159,austin0731,The conclusion to Caeser's journey in a brutal and grim last chapter,9,14 July 2017,"The final chapter of Caesar's trilogy was an amazing end to his story, the cinematography, character development and the brilliance in the technology that brings the apes to life were all highlights of the film but I would like to go into more depth on the specifics that made War such an amazing film despite not actually being so 'war' centric, no it delivered something even better. Because it did not focus on big battle sequences it actually focuses heavily on the carnage and horrors of war and like all ape movies it provokes thought on humanity and provides a reflective viewpoint on humanity. This is such a great move even though it catches audiences off because it reminds us of the true cost of war, unlike movies that depict war this one does not glorify it at all. So the opening scene was one of the greatest scenes I have ever seen, the music was on point and the intensity of the moment was done so well, it was really cool also to see the 'Koba supporter apes', the 'Donkey's' alongside the humans in all of the military gear. Then the scene at the ape's waterfall hideout in which Woody Harrelson's character the colonel kills Caesar's wife and son Blue eyes, who has just returned with news of a 'promised land' in which the apes could be safe was done very well as well. The raw emotion and hate from Caesar is introduced here as he immediately jumps into the fall in an attempt to take down the colonel, a theme that would be featured throughout the entirety of the film.So essentially Caesar then breaks off with the main group of apes with a few of his Lieutenants on a vengeful warpath to take down the colonel, his whole character arc was just developed so beautifully as he conflicts with hate and forgiveness. Which actually is a very tough position that we have never seen Caesar in, we see him slowly consumed by his hatred as he attempts to hunt the colonel down which eventually leads to his downfall and abandonment of what had mattered to him most, his apes, his family. On his path of revenge the group also runs into two very important and interesting characters, 'Bad ape' who acts as a comedic relief that I thought worked well and adds a hint of joy and innocence in an otherwise completely brutal and graphic film. And Nova, the little girl who acts as both a reminder to Caesar of the good in humanity and the lost of his child. Nova also helps to explain why the humans in the original films were primitive and unable to speak, really connecting the dots and bridging the rebooted franchise with the original. A moment that was extremely emotional and impactful also comes from her interactions with Luca the big, intimidating gorilla in a moment of tenderness and innocent bond. So in that scene Luca sees Nova looking up at these cherry blossoms and walks up to he, he looked intimidating but he goes and plucks a flower and places it behind Nova's ear. Later when Luca is mortally wounded trying to save Caesar, Nova pushes through the other apes and just begins to cry as she removes the flower and places it behind Luca's ear as Luca passes with a smile on his face. Moments like this just goes to highlight the humanity and pureness in a setting of war and brutality. Later on in the military encampment there were scenes of slavery and brutality and ultimately ended as the apes discover a way out and attempts to escape the camp, Caesar unable to put down his hate realizes that he is in fact just like Koba and once again leaves the apes in an attempt to take down the colonel, however the shocking revelation as he breaks into the colonel's room is that the colonel who was in contact with Nova's doll has been infected by the mutated ALZ-113 virus and in a twist of poetic justice had blood streaking out of his nostrils and was struggling to speak, seeing this Caesar gives up on his hate and leaves the colonel to commit suicide. Caesar then dashes out with a handful of grenades in an attempt to blow up the encampment as an army of humans opposing the colonel's ways marches on, as he is about to fling the grenades onto an oil tankard a soldier shoots him, the one who Caeser releases in the beginning of the film out of mercy, as the soldier was about to deal the fatal blow, the 'donkey' ape who has been helping the humans just blows up the soldier in one amazing shot and immediately another soldier pulls out a pistol and blasts his head off, so Caeser flings the grenades, everything blows up and he runs to join his apes, just as he rejoins them an avalanche rolls in and in the end wipes out all the humans.Finally Caesar and the surviving apes move to the 'promised land' and Caesar's saga completes as he watches his smallest son playing in the grasses with Nova and passes away with his loyal friend Maurice still by his side.War for the planet of the apes truly elevates the story of Caesar, it provokes thoughts on war, hatred, races..

It develops the character so meaningfully and concludes an amazing tale, it is an absolute must see ape fan or not.",War for the Planet of the Apes
160,galahad58-1,War - A Bit Misleading,7,23 August 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes really isn't a movie about a war for the planet. For older fans the title makes you believe that this film would be close to Battle For the Planet of the Apes from the 70s, but it is not an action/war film.War is more of a survival epic about the apes looking for their exodus for the promised land. A movie the makes all apes good and all humans bad.The story is decent, until the last 15-20 minutes where it all falls apart.This movie had potential- some things that would have made this a 10 movie: the humans from the second movie living in a mutual community with the apes and working together to create a better world - avoiding the cliché mutation of the virus to try and tie the movie to the original 1960s film (which was unnecessary) - having two human armies fighting for control of the military - the really bad ending where a natural disaster kills every single human, but all the apes (who are standing next to them) survive.There are a lot of flaws that stand out - especially at the end of the movie - but it is not as bad as some folks have written. It is a decent movie that rates a 7.",War for the Planet of the Apes
161,ivanmessimilos,Great conclusion,8,29 May 2021,"A great ending to one of the best trilogies of the last twenty years. The film is visually beautiful and the CGI effects are amazing. This is especially seen in scenes with monkeys, and that's every scene in the movie. The vast majority of the dialogue is not done through standard conversation but vocal language, which may seem a little awkward, but the film didn't suffer at all because of it. Monkeys have numerous layers just like humans. The emphasis is on them, not on people, which is even logical given the story. The film contains a great combination of drama and action. I also liked what it has to do with the cult Planet of the Apes (which is one of my favorite movies) so we can freely call this a prequel trilogy. Great job director Reeves, I can't wait for his next project. I rarely see such a good connection through all three films. The downside is the title, which is technically inaccurate and could change some people's expectations. In fact, the last sequel is more of a War than this one. In some ways, the film surprised me because I didn't think it would go in that direction. Great proposal for a marathon: watch first this prequel trilogy and then Planet of the Apes from 1968 with Charlton Heston.",War for the Planet of the Apes
162,TheVictoriousV,Opposable thumbs up! (Copied from myself with permission),8,24 January 2019,"""Human get sick. Ape get smart. Human kill ape."" That is where the final story begins. Matt Reeves' War for the Planet of the Apes starts at a point where any hope of peace between the dwindling human race and the increasingly intelligent apes has vanished. It has been hailed as a modern masterpiece and while I will not go that far in my verdict, I can see why viewers would find that this one stands out amongst the usual summer movies.The leader of the apes is Caesar, once again portrayed via state-of-the-art motion-capture by Andy Serkis, and the force of humans they are primarily up against is led by a figure known simply as The Colonel (Woody Harrelson, fantastic as usual). After this ruthless officer invades the jungle-based safe haven of Caesar's followers, killing his wife and child in the process, Caesar elects to seek him out while the other apes search for another sanctuary, rumored to lie beyond the wastelands, where the humans never travel.He is joined by such fellow apes as the wise Maurice (Karin Konoval) and later a human child nick-named ""Nova"" (Amiah Miller) who has mysteriously lost the ability to speak. I was expecting to see more Internet-based complaints with regards to how the most important female character in the film doesn't say anything, but I suppose it's less obvious when the only characters with bigger roles are non-human. Also, I imagine the recent Doctor Who announcement has given the opinion-having web crusaders other things to think about.I must say, though, that the decision of showing this film exclusively from the point-of-view of the apes was the right one, especially considering the walking clichés that all the non-Oldman human beings were back in Dawn (I needn't remind anyone of Mr. ""I'm The A-hole"", capital T intentional). Also interesting is the fact that not all of the chimps, gorillas, and orangutans have mastered speech yet and are thus forced to communicate via gestures, if at all.I was surprised at how much of the film was conveyed either via sign language or in complete silence, noting that this sort of patience is not normally expected from the audience of a summer blockbuster. There were some moments where we got subtitles even though the characters didn't seem to do much of anything with their hands, and at some points Caesar would respond verbally to sign language occurring outside of his peripheral vision, but I admired the minimalism all the same.Another thing that has always set the Apes trilogy apart from most modern garden-variety blockbusters is the characterizations. I maintain that Caesar the Ape is probably one of the most intriguing and complex characters of recent mainstream cinema, thanks both to the writing and Andy Serkis; even at his most vengeful, we understand his wrath because we have seen his suffering (plus, it may be part of his increasingly human mind), and we can believe his status as a respected leader to his ""people"" because we know his courage and sacrifices.The next thing is, as you won't be shocked to learn, the outright astonishing effects, which have only gotten better and better with each film. And it isn't just in terms of the flawlessly natural movements of the animals or the way their bodies interact with the environments. As my dad confirmed after a local screening, they've also improved the lighting issues of the last chapter and opted for physically based rendering instead of ""tweaking"" everything until you can see all the little details of the textures, even in scenes where it wouldn't match the rest of the lighting. In War it looks bafflingly good and it is never once blatantly obvious where the CGI ends and the physically real objects begin.Sure there are some stupidly plot convenient moments, instances of questionable geography (I don't know where in America this takes place that the characters can travel from a desert to a snowy pine forest within a seemingly short time), one downright jarring product placement, and a few remaining character clichés such as the ""Five Man Band"" Caesar puts together once he vows to hunt down The Colonel, complete with a ""Sixth Ranger"" in the form of a cowardly chimpanzee called ""Bad Ape"" (Steve Zahn). There was also a point near the end where the human side began to seem a little too overtly evil and I detected some not too subtle allusions to Trump's ""Adolf-ian America"" wherein the fascist humans are constructing a wall at the expense of the apes and there comes a time where we must ask ourselves who the REAL Mexicans are.Luckily, they saved it somewhat during a conversation scene between Caesar and The Colonel, where we more clearly understand why The Colonel does as he does and how he fears a sort of ""great replacement"", as I've elected to call it to make it even more topical. War for the Planet of the Apes is still an inordinately complex and thoughtful action film (especially for one that happens to star Simians with machine guns) which also boasts top-class visual effects, a powerful score by Michael Giacchino, great photography throughout the whole show, characters as memorable as they are intriguing, peak performances, and a few interesting references to the original Planet of the Apes that make me hope this is not just the end of the reboot trilogy, but of the whole franchise.When Caesar fell to his knees outside The Colonel's fortress as though he were about to shout ""you maniacs"", I felt that the circle was complete.",War for the Planet of the Apes
163,Gresh854,An Absolutely Heart-Wrenching Conclusion to A Near-Perfect Trilogy,6,14 July 2017,"From the beginning I heard this series was going to be made I doubted that'd it be successful, even though I was a fan of the 1968 original. Then I saw Rise, and I absolutely loved that film, making me completely invested and insured in the series seriousness. Then I saw Dawn, and I loved that film even more than Rise. And a couple nights ago, I was crossing my fingers hoping that War could complete this trilogy on a high note. Thankfully, I am glad to say that War for the Planet of the Apes, is by far the best Planet of the Apes movie yet. War is by far surprisingly not only the most intriguing of the two movies, but really the most emotional movie of them all. The movie is advertised as a violent war battle between the apes and the humans, and you do get some of that in this movie, but in reality, this movie is about the conflictions in which Caesar is to undergo. The journey that Caesar takes in this movie is what made me love this film. This film is more of a character piece, than it is an action-packed battle. This film takes the time to sacrifice action sequences, for extremely well written scenes, between characters. I don't want to spoil Woody Harrelson's character. All I'm simply going to say is that he is by far the best human character we've had in this franchise. The main issue I had with most of the new Planet of the Ape films were the human characters. They were just fine and they worked for their purpose, but Harrelson's character is very well developed. You get his motivations, and the reason for why he's the way he is. The element that will stay in your head, I think the most for most audiences, is the way the film produces its sentimental sequences. A majority of those sequences really hit me, right in the heart, and that's rare for a modern day film to do that for me, especially a blockbuster. War is by far, one of the best movies I've seen of 2017, and is the perfect conclusion to the best trilogy I've seen since The Dark Knight trilogy. I'd give War for the Planet of the Apes a letter grade of a solid ""A"".",War for the Planet of the Apes
164,anthonyjlangford,Not terrible. Just unnecessary,6,1 August 2017,"It's a shame these days that there are so many fake reviews, it's hard to know what to believe. No film is that polarizing to deserve a 1 star or 10. You have to wonder if the studios themselves aren't behind these drives to either prop up their own films or smear the competitors. In time, when the dust settles, the true score is revealed, but that doesn't help people who are trying to make up their minds whether or not to see it.In brief, this is the weakest of the three Ape films. It felt superfluous. Most of the ground here was covered in the previous installment. It's stale, not fresh.There are many moments of one on one interaction. They are supposed to be emotional, yet with the piano and strings in accompaniment it also feels forced. Sure a couple of moments are genuinely, though mildly, moving but not to the extent the filmmakers would wish.The final act moves along quite nicely and plays out in a way that is really no surprise but is quite entertaining to watch. The prior two thirds is really quite dull and silly. Especially the borderline Jar Jar Binks character. Like Jar Jar he's supposed to provide comic relief. He doesn't get close. (To be fair, no one trumps Jar Jar).The quality of the ape CGI has improved a lot since film one. You really can't tell if they are a combination of actor and CGI or complete CGI. Impressive. Some of the other effects towards the end however, are fairly lukewarm.If you're a big fan you'll see it anyway. I just hope they don't make any more. Like the original five movies from the seventies, there was a peak and then they became irrelevant. History repeating indeed.",War for the Planet of the Apes

166,Lewis_Heather787,Great ending to a ever improving franchise!,8,17 July 2017,"It is very rare for a franchise to improve with every new instalment, rise was a good start and base to launch of from. Dawn upped the stakes and consequences for both the apes and the humans, ending with a very good cliffhanger. So going into war the creators had a rather nice but pressure situation with creating this film with audience expectations. So how did the conclusion fair?Firstly lets start with the director of the film Matt Reeves, who step into the franchise when directing Dawn of the planet of the apes, which was a very good accomplishment. Once again he has triumphed with another stellar film in the franchise, improving on certain areas and keeping the core elements we love the same. He has managed to finely balance the film with great action and intense intimate scenes between main characters. The struggle between the two main stories and conflicts of the film, which both are very understandable the human side and apes. The directing compliments both the huge action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film and the journey of Caesar and the apes to find the ""human zoo"". Beautiful shots and set pieces from start to finish.Another area of the film that Reeves excels in is the screenplay of the film which also really well written, a brilliant mix of seriousness and emotion for both the apes and the humans. There is a good focus on the struggle for Caesar which is dwindling away from Dawn and his focus for revenge on the family tragedy that happens. Reeves is so good in writing family troubles and tragedies, for his next film reeves should look for a character with these elements to them....oh wait!!!! The script felt natural with good wit and charm but can easily flip to serious in places for the situations that both the humans and the apes are in. Due to this great screen writing the audience can really resonate with both sides of the story once again both for the humans and the apes struggle in the world after the simian flu. The acting in the film just like the other films is really good again and a brilliant central performance from Andy Serkis, who is complimented very well by Woody Harrelson. These are the two stars of the film however the rest of the cast are not far behind them because everyone in the film is really good it is just this two are slightly above the rest. Serkis shows a new dynamic to the character of Caesar and the journey that he has been on from the first film, he shows a damaged and aged character really well. Woody Harrelson is really good in the film as the main human voice in the film, even though he is not a nice guy you, as the audience, can understand his positioned to a certain degree. He does have some good points however his desperation and fear of death and destruction has made his delusional and is his ultimate demise. Maurice once again is the calming voice in the film for Caesar and is still a fan favourite with some really good comedy moments with bad ape. Talking of bad ape he is really good as the comedic relief in the film which is balanced really well in the film, it could have become a laughing stock and boring, however this film judged it really well. The final character to mention is the one with no lines and that is nova, she is a really good and emotional character even though she has no lines in the film, really interesting character. The CGI of the film is some of the best that has been put to screen in recent times, it is seamless and truly outstanding. It definitely deserves some recognition during awards season at the end of the year, there are times in the film where you forget that the apes and motion capture. Another area that is the final positive of the film is the score which compliments the film really well. Michael Giacchino does really well with the score complimenting the scenes in the film heightens tension when needed and can be mesmerising at times.Finally the negatives of the film, there are very few and involves the ending of the film. The ending of the film is a little obvious for the film but however I can see why they needed to do it to complete the trilogy and the story of the characters. All in all the is film is 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, A really good film, with fantastic directing and story telling with breath taking visuals it is a must see in the cinema. A great conclusion to a brilliant trilogy of films, one of the best trilogies ever.",War for the Planet of the Apes
167,Dragonsouls,Cinematic masterpiece,9,13 July 2017,"I never thought I'd ever see another groundbreaking film ever again but War for the Planet of the Apes is a movie that sets major standards when it comes to visual filmmaking. This movie was so beautifully put together, both technically and artistically, from the mind blowing motion capture CGI to the beautiful set design.Matt Reeves has outdone himself with this movie. His masterful directing, coupled with Michael Giacchino's old fashioned 1970s movie soundtrack, creates an atmosphere that we just don't see anymore in modern films. I would even go as far as saying that this is one of the best War films since Apocalypse Now. Matt Reeves' camera work and film editing style was very reminiscent of Coppola's masterpiece, and if I were to describe War for the Planet of the Apes in one world;-it would be; ""haunting."" At heart, this movie is a war film and an action film, which I admit, was a bit disappointing because the Apes films usually focus on social commentary and clashes of different ideals regarding the human condition. This is not the thought provoking film that some of the older and previous films were. But in a sense, it never had to be. This is the 3rd and final act of what has been a 7 hour film....and expect a whole lot of fireworks.But as some CGI driven films have proved, none of the spectacle matters unless we have characters to care for. And fortunately Reeves teamed up with the same writers from Dawn to continue the story of the characters they know all so well. Caesar, Maurice, Rocket and welcomed newcomer named ""Bad Ape,"" have miles of charisma and they all serve as important functions in Caesar's journey. My favorite was Bad Ape, who added much needed comedy and levity in what is otherwise a very dark and heavy story. Another surprise came from Woody Harrelson's character, known simply as ""The Colonel."" Some of the best villains are those who fit in that gray area, right between right and wrong, and the Colonel was exactly that.In the end, some questions were raised, and I wished we had gotten more information regarding the virus; which is once again, an important part of the story. Perhaps Reeves left it open to interpretation on purpose.",War for the Planet of the Apes
168,Ziya90,The same lazy direction and storytelling again!,4,27 August 2017,"You know, the first chapter ""The Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was a good beginning. It was a solid action adventure. A modernized version of the old ""ape"" movies. When the second movie was released, people almost loved it, so the movie got lots of praise and admiration as a brilliant movie. However, if you ask me, it was seriously dull by a lazy editing and storytelling. All those trailers and posters of the second film (apes grabbing weapons etc.) gave us a promise of lots of action and suspense, but actually it was not, that's why it was a boring movie. While the most of the second movie takes place in an ape shelter with an imperceptible story, this third movie mostly takes place in a military base! This is because the director takes the easy way out while telling us the story. The third movie is the same, maybe worse, I don't know, but I can figure out easily that why a lot of audiences felt cheated. It is because the last two movies were misleading. Look at the poster of this movie! You can see clearly a grand battle between apes and humans, but the director cannot tell us this war in a wider scale, instead, most of the movie takes place in a military base/internment camp this time, so? We expect lots of action, adventure, a worldwide battle, but we get stuck in that military base and we cannot escape from there as audiences! The film starts like ""The Predator"", but after this promise, it gets worse and worse. We get lost inside the weird plot of the movie. This movie has not a proper beginning, a proper development and a proper end/climax. It feels like a semi documentary at times, but it is not. This is not a human vs. ape story. This is a boring movie about captured apes, killer apes, apes with a good heart etc. This movie, also the previous one have a pace issue! The first chapter was perfect for this, but the last two movies have a serious pace problem. It is somewhere between a semi drama and semi documentary and an action adventure film. Also, now we have a second Apocalypse Now ""homage"" after ""King Kong: The Skull Island"", but despite Woody Harrelson is such an amazing actor, his villain character here is not intimidating, influential or dramatic. In the movie, there is always a glimpse or feeling that something is going to happen, but that moment never comes. There is a special forces unit in white who reminds me storm-troopers in Star Wars, but wait a minute! They get wasted in the plot. There is a virus danger added into the plot, but it gets ridiculous and pointless. And I have never been a fan of Caesar. Yes, he is an alpha male, he is a leader, he is not evil etc. but he is overrated. I don't adore or have admiration for this ape. He is not like Dr. Zira in the original film. In these movies, humans are depicted as villains and apes are depicted as heroes to root for, but this doesn't work here actually. Is this a sentimental movie? Will you break into tears? Hell, No! If you ask me, even Tim Burton's disappointing The Planet of the Apes version is better than these movies. This movie could have been an epic finale.",War for the Planet of the Apes
169,heisenberg12,"Long, sometimes boring, but satisfying ending and send off for the trilogy",6,20 August 2017,"""War"" does many things right and some things wrong in its conclusive final installment. Ultimately what you have here is an epic of a movie. It's overly long, which makes it boring at times. The very little dialogue replaced by ape sign language translated in captions is a big reason for that so be sure to watch this movie awake or else you could fall asleep near the beginning. However, the film finally does pick up in the third act and in the end so you'll want to stick around for that. It's a touching and memorable final send off to Caeser's story and one that vindicated itself in the final twenty minutes despite a boring middle ninety for the most part.I liked the end and the final 20 minutes, but that's not enough to justify the preceding 90 minutes of boredom that I had to fight falling asleep at least three times in order to get through. So I can't rate it high due to that.6/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
170,Jared_Andrews,The War for Caesar's Soul,9,26 July 2017,"If you have forgotten what happened in the first two movies, don't worry. ""War"" opens with a clear and concise recap of the events leading up to this movie. It's a smart way to commence and an indication of the thoughtful nature with which this movie was made.The movie obviously depicts a literal war for planet between the humans and the apes. There's also a figurative and less obvious war going on—one for Caesar's soul. The movie is really about Caesar's battle to remain pure and free from hate in world that corrupted Koba and the Colonel (Woody Harrelson).This question remains open for much of the movie, as we see for the first time some real cracks in Caesar's previously infallible morals. He has real reasons to give into the hatred (as you will see), and his humanity is truly tested. It all boils down to one scene, which of course, I will not spoil. A bit is left to interpretation, but I personally found clarity in the scene and settled comfortably on my answer.This movie fulfills anything and everything you could possibly desire in the final installment of this trilogy. The action sequences deliver intensity and genuine feelings of danger. This wasn't like many movies of this sort where the ""good guys"" sort of seem invincible. Everyone felt vulnerable, which amplified the suspense greatly. Additionally, the storytelling is flawless. It's littered with foreshadowing, eye-popping imagery, and provocative social parallels.While the excellent visuals and storytelling were expected, there were also two elements that took me aback by how well they were executed. The first was the dialogue, which honored the Apes' basic vocabulary and still managed to showcase the depths of their awareness. The other element was the performances of the actors playing apes.This may sound strange to say, but I think Andy Serkis deserves serious Academy Award consideration. His gravitas and emotional complexity come across clearly even though he never actually appears on screen.Caesar is one of the most deeply fascinating and thoughtful characters in recent movie memory, as evidenced by his growth over these three movies. It's time Serkis received proper recognition for bringing Caesar to life.",War for the Planet of the Apes

It's a fitting conclusion to Caesar's story. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this absolute masterpiece of science fiction. Let me just say first that the trailers and ads showcased an influx of action and the title alone seems to promise non-stop sequences of bloodshed and destruction, but make no mistake, this is a drama film, through and through. The motion capture performances are raw and poignant. A majority of the film (which is nearly two and a half hours long) doesn't have any spoken dialogue. You absorb everything through the ape's actions, facial expressions and emotions and it hits hard, especially when you witness them endure the brutal wrath of the humans. The music by Michael Giacchino does a brilliant job setting the mood; it's the most moving score he's ever composed and each character has their own specific theme. The setting and visuals also contribute to the emotional factor, displaying some rather gritty locations backed up by bold and skillful lighting and color correction techniques that ultimately breathes a bleak and dreadful atmosphere throughout the film's running time.

Some sort of odyssey, combined with the concentration camp motif? It grapples with ideas perhaps too big to be incorporated in an action film.

This one is very high-budget, A-list film-making, but the title is stupid.I was expecting an awesome Braveheart-style throwdown, with several epic battles, in a campaign to decide the fate of Earth, with some intriguing political or betrayal or love-story subplots.The film should be called ""Ape Escape: Part 2"". Woody Allen, I mean Harrelson, turns in an honorable performance as the vengeful, cold colonel, and Caesar is always good. However, the film misled most moviegoers with the title. The movie is not really about the war campaign between apes and humans, but more about social messages, and rehashes the same exact storyline from many other ape films, including the original reboot to this trilogy. The film is well-shot, and looks beautiful. The trailers have an epic feel, but this doesn't really play out until the end of the movie. I feel SO MUCH MORE could have been done with this movie, but was built around a sorrowful worker escape plot, instead of a bad ass battle royal with political intrigue and a better script. This was kind of boring, aside from the great effects, and the few great moments between Caesar and Woody Harrelson. I am usually very much into these films, but this one had all of us like, ""meh"".

181,Come-and-Review,Too many things prevent it from being the perfect ending,8,22 July 2017,"When I left the theatre, I had partially mixed feelings. War for the planet of the apes was not at all what I was expecting, or what I wanted to see, and however I did like it, It left with a slight bitter taste in my mouth. Again, I still rated this film 9/10, and I still enjoyed it, but it lacked in those technical and visual elements that made me love Dawn of the planet of the apes.The story has been the main subject of most of the criticisms, and the source of my unclear feelings. Woddy Harrelson's colonel much reminds of Colonel E. Kurtz from Apocalypse Now, I'll give that. Both are partially Christian extremists, in a way or the other. Tons of details point to a religious subtheme around the colonel, which I enjoyed, as finally depicts on screen forms of religious terrorism other than Islamic extremists. Last film I recalled that showed Christian extremists was Incendies by Dennis Villneuve (mind: I'm not an Atheist. I'm a mormon, a non-catholic Christian, and my views are against any form of religious extremism). It is a mistake, however, to consider the X-shaped structures on which Caesar and other apes are put as a form of torture or death sentence as a metaphor for cruxifiction. I'd rather consider it as a parallel with the ""scarecrow"", X shaped structures seen in the 1968 Planet of the Apes. There is definitely some recalling to the Holocaust and concentration camps, in the second half of the film. The film also provides an ""origin story"" for the muteness of humans as seen in Planet of the Apes, which is also partly the premise for the final battle between humans. It is true: except for the beginning skirmish, there is no on-screen battle between apes and humans, and the final clash is between humans who then are destroyed by an avalanche. But there is a reason for that: the ending of the first Planet of the Apes film from 1968. The original film had evidently expressed that apes took over the world after humans destroyed each other. The avalanche is a logical Deus Ex Machina: during the final Battle, set near a snowy mountain, tons of extremely loud explosions are heard, as well as the huge explosion that Caesar ignites in order to blow up the colonel's fortress. An avalanche is a quite obvious consequence.What I really appreciated, was the acting and the VFX. All the ape-actors, including Serkis, Zahn and so on, gave great performances, which I as a viewer could feel through their mo-cap CG characters. The VFX was truly flawless. When I recently got to know that some of the ape extras where not portrayed by real actors at all, and that many sequenced where 95% CG, I couldn't believe it. This film truly shows how huge the conflict between practical and CG effects actually is. On one hand, I perfectly understand how some directors prefer to give as much real elements for actors to interact with and to have as many things in camera as possible, but on the other hand Weta digital and others did an astonishing work in recent years, by even building softwares to simulate a tree's life cycle, its leafs and more details which then appear even in landscape shots. Both techniques are therefore stunningly impressive, when used on films.There was a huge issue I had with the film, that being the score. I felt it being really dull. I heard that same ""emotional scene theme"" from Giacchino in all of the reboot Star Trek films, in Jurassic World, in Super 8, in Rogue One (though on this one Giacchino largely saved himself by adopting a Williamsesque style), in the previous film, and in each of the 120+ episodes of Lost. You can see how much he overuses almost the same theme over and over. Even Dawn had some better score than this. What I also felt being weak, was the directional side of the film. Let me explain: Dawn had a stunning opening and ending shot parallel, with a Sergio-Leonesque close-up on Caesar's eyes. It also had an astounding 360° shot that follows the rotation of the tank's turret during the assault scene. It also has a 2-3 minutes of uncut footage of Jason Clarke running through the colony, while hiding from apes. War had very astonishing visuals, I'll give it that, but very rarely delivered storytelling with such techniques. Its final sequence had transitions, something I strictly hate to see on film, and that was appealing maybe 30 years ago. The final scene could have been portrayed better - don't get me wrong, it was emotional and touching, but it felt very common as and ending for the sci-fi trilogy that is the best of the decade.",War for the Planet of the Apes

A lot of the ""soft"" moments felt forced and I was expecting something different when the title includes ""War"". There were moments that dragged for me, but the story itself made sense. Caesar's end was anticlimactic and I left wishing for some more closure. I might have to do a rewatch without the prior expectations I had for the film.",War for the Planet of the Apes
183,spencergrande6,A fitting and altogether satisfying conclusion to the new Apes trilogy,8,20 August 2017,"A fitting and altogether satisfying conclusion to the new Apes trilogy and the most complete and thematically satisfying one yet. Harrelson is a pure nutjob villain but he at least starts to hint at the some of the broader questions the characters in this universe should be asking more of - namely what does this do to the evolutionary ladder/food chain and what exactly does it mean for God and souls? (this still gets short shrift, probably to avoid alienating audiences). He sees himself as a messiah delivering the human race from a scourge of its own making - he doesn't seem to hate the apes so much as understand objectively what they mean for the human race. He's more complex this way.There are some homages to the original Planet here too - the little girl is named Nova and the flu has mutated causing humans to become less intelligent (this is not what is meant in the original film but sure - it does can explain why humans don't fight back and can't read). Some of the final scenes are a little too on the nose and ham-handed. Caesar as the real messiah leading his people to the promised land. The gorilla that finally turns good at the end (this scene could have worked but is dumb in execution - Caesar almost dies anyway). The apes survive an avalanche because they climb trees - this is what is meant by an evolutionary advantage apparently. Between that, the mutated flu and the old version of it, this explains how the Planet becomes one of Apes. It works but feels a bit over-engineered.I really appreciate how this trilogy of Apes films is a character and theme based work first. These films use state of the art CGI in order to create more believable characters and tell a tale not possible any other way (I mean, yeah makeup, which I do miss, but still for the new films this is what works). There aren't many overblown action scenes that dominate and wear down the film. This is what franchise big budget movie-making should look like.",War for the Planet of the Apes

The film is pretending to try and tell us something meaningful but it's just rather trite nonsense mixed in with a lot of CGI and action chimps.

185,rutzelb,A Masterpiece,10,29 October 2017,"Caesar (Andy Serkis) believes his clan must leave the Woods and go to the Desert where they will be safe from the Army. But he won't accompany them until he kills the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) who killed his wife and son.This is nothing short of a masterpiece and I don't say that lightly. The acting, stunts, CGI and cinematography are all outstanding. Two things: Andy Serkis must be nominated for Best Actor and, of course, so should Woody Harrelson as anytime he is in a movie, the Academy should automatically award him a Best Actor Award as he is that good whether in a comedy or in a drama. And, yes, the movie itself should be nominated for Best Picture and the Director for Best Director. Hey, this is an epic movie and the music says so too. So there!This is not all Ape against Ape and the Army. Well, it is but the fighting is not as prevalent as most would think. The powers that be saw that constant fighting is not the answer to a good movie. And so it is. A breath of fresh air is the little girl (Amiah Miller) Caesar finds on his way to find the Colonel. She is named Nova after a Chevy Nova logo. She doesn't talk and we don't know the reason for that. Caesar's men shot dead her father or her guardian as we don't know exactly who he was. A very strange scene has her looking at her dead father or guardian with no emotion at all. However, later on she will get to you and you may need that box of Kleenex. A sort of comic relief is Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) who is against any decision by Caesar and his men, but eventually he always gives in. His scenes would have been funnier had the Director stretched out his misgivings because he was that good. Ah, well, we can't have everything. The supporting cast is impeccable. Maurice (Karin Konoval) is Caesar's chief confidant; Red Donkey (Ty Olsson) is a chief enforcer for the Colonel; and Toby Kebbel as Koba who is only seen in Caesar's visions or dreams – if you remember, Koba is the more aggressive Ape who was constantly against Caesar. All in all this is a very satisfying movie and I didn't want it to end (Even though it was a little too long?) (10/10)Violence: Yes.

187,AnishMisra,Planet of Apes 3 review,10,11 October 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a film directed by Matt Reeves. I loved the first 2 films of this series. And was looking forward to this film for quite some time. Finally when I saw the film, I can definitely say I'm Spechless. This film is definitely one of the best 2017 has to offer.Plot: Caesar and his ape family face the wrath of a ruthless Colonel.Story and direction: The film is basically an arc. It started with Caeser as a small child, then the Caesar who grew up for the torture his community suffered and finally to fight back. This film is a masterpiece in itself. And not only in terms of production quality, but the story is so pure. It touches upon things that I was quite shocked to see. The very first scene of this film, sets the tone of the film to be very dark. But then we see that Caesar doesn't just want out to go on killing humans, he just want them to back off his ape community. Then we see his visions of Koba as to what he did to him. Blue Eyes' mate Lake was also a very significant character. I did resonate with her in the scene where she sees Blue Eyes after a long time. But certain events then happen, that force Caesar to do things that are quite dark. And then a dialogue, ""You are no less than Koba"" by Maurice was so thought provoking. Then we have Nova, the girl who initially was scared of the apes but finally decides to be with them in their cause, because she saw the apes for how good they were. And finally Bad Ape. I guess that was a great addition to this franchise. His fear and his humor (which was subtle) were all very justified. The way he says he gets his name was good. Michael Giacchino's music is to look out for. The VFX is top notch. It never felt like the VFX was fake. It felt so natural. The sets too very magnificent and natural to the setting of the story.Performances: Andy Serkis should take a bow from me. What a performance and what a genius he is. I couldn't imagine Caesar without this person. Woody Harrelson was also great as Colonel. He has his moments too. Amiah Miller was also great as Nova. Steve Zahn was just right for Bad Ape. Toby Kebbell was also good as the cold ape Koba (for the little screen time he received). A special mention to Terry Notary for Maurice. The way he supports Caesar is commendable.Favorite Scene: The scene where Caesar regrets not recognizing the hate Koba had for humans. Then Maurice says a very nice dialogue that one cannot know what feels inside. This dialogue has just made a seat in my minds. And it basically says about our society in general.Verdict: This is one of those films where I can say that the third part is the best. I couldn't take out a flaw in this film. I was spellbound as the credits were rolling. This film series will have a special place in my life.I am going to give this film a wholeheartedly deserving 10/10.",War for the Planet of the Apes
188,bastille-852-731547,"Well-made, dark and thrilling third chapter; but not quite as good as the first two.",7,11 July 2017,"At a point about mid-way through this sequel, we see a portion of a tunnel with graffiti reading ""Ape-ocalypse Now."" Not only is that a pun on the film ""Apocalypse Now,"" it also adequately describes the tone and style of this chapter of the franchise. Dark and often pessimistic, the film chronicles a climatic battle between the apes (lead by Caesar) and humans (lead by a colonel played by Woody Harrelson.) As expected, the CGI used to create the apes is breathtakingly realistic—as is the depiction of the film's primarily snowy setting. The film packs a greater emotional punch than a typical summer blockbuster. It is impressive how director Matt Reeves is able to make us feel so much for the main ape characters—which is primarily done through plot development, the film's dark tone, and the apes' motives and even facial expressions. While the film is on the longer side (142 minutes,) it never feels tedious or too long.Despite its unique and powerful tone, this film does contain some elements that unfortunately stop it from becoming quite as strong as ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" or ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes."" While Reeves goes out of his way to make the ape characters feel unique and personal, the same cannot be said for the human characters. Unlike the apes, they feel simply just like caricatures. This notion is not helped by the fact that Woody Harrelson's supporting performance as a colonel left something to be desired. The only exception to this is the young girl that the apes find. Additionally, the addition of Bad Ape to the film did not do much for me. I understand that his purpose in the film is to add comic relief, but it always felt rather forced, unlike the actions of the other apes—whose presence on screen prove that this visually stunning, dark, and ambitious epic will please fans of the franchise. 7/10",War for the Planet of the Apes

Everything in War is beautiful done, dialogue, effects, photography, music and acting both simian and human. these films have been emotionally rewarding, making you care for the characters, without obvious bad guys, both sides have valid reasons for their actions, there is no black and white, but the grey inbetween as in real life. the work of andy serkis and the cgi guys just seems to be getting better and better, where now it is fully acceptable and believable that the apes are real, living, breathing and dying sentient beings. so far the film of the year.",War for the Planet of the Apes
190,elenaphysics,A really weird film,4,13 July 2017,"OK , let us begin. This movie is not good. I enjoyed rise of the planet of the apes, I did not much enjoy the dawn of the planet of the Apes, but what I certainly did not like was this one. If you remove the nice cinematography, if you remove the apes and substitute them with people, do you know what you will see? You will see a bunch of movies you have already watched before. Nothing special. What really stuns me, are the weird religious symbolism in this movie.And also historical symbolism. They were not necessary , and took away the originality of the film. The whole thing with the Crucifixions. OK they were not crucified, they were tied with ropes on crosses, not making the + cross symbol but the x mark like a ''crux decussata'' of saint Andreas. Anyway, the military camp which becomes a concentration camp for the apes, where they are forced to work, looks so much like Auschwitz- Birkenau. The story of the Jews and the Holocost has been in so many movies, and Auschwitz holds a special place in those movies. Just , don't turn this movie in to a Holocaust movie. Where apes are the jews and the Nazi-like character of Colonel wants to exterminate them. The whole Nazi thing is prevalent in this movie. The way soldiers obey, the colonel shaving his head, the fact that he killed his son because after he got infected by the virus because he stopped being human (therefore pure like the Nazis wanted to be) The soldier whose live was spared, and seemed to respect Ceasar in a way, was the one who killed him. It was like an element of surprise ,but I have seen it in about 10 movies already. In the end Ceasar, as another Moses from the Bible, leads the Apes (jews) to the land of Canaan. I have watched Moses movies so many times. I do not want another Bible movie. Also the character of little zoo ape who could talk, was supposed to be funny. But it wasn't. Actually it reminded me of the lost and disoriented Gollum from the Lord of the Rings. Which can not be a coincidence, since Andy Serkis was actually the Gollum in those movies. Seriously the movie was bad. Don't watch it. But I am afraid the you will because everyone is tempted to watch the end of a trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes
191,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,9,30 July 2017,"The third and possible final installment of the Planet of the Apes reboot series had a lot of anticipation since it had wowed me with Rise and Dawn, proud to say that it's not only the best one of the series but a definite contender for best film for this year (look out Logan). Firstly, the script is award worthy material that balances emotion, gritty realism and solid character development. Though the film isn't all action about human and apes fighting each other as you would expect but it intends to show the effecting war that Cesar is fighting personally with his moral values and those around him, it shows that war isn't all peace and avoidable.To make the story work so well, the performance of Andy Sirkus is one that should be considered for an Oscar. Carrying strong emotions, a sense of pride in the role and feeling of a real human but in an ape, Serkis gives a performance that shows that he knows how to make a character seem so real. Woody Harrelson was also amazing, his role reminded me of Marlon Brando from Apocalypse Now and the supporting cast were all great.The cinematography was great throughout, showing a clear, dark and gritty tone to the story, borrowing references from various war films it felt at times like a war film but keeping in tone to the human aspect and the personal perspective. Visual effects is at a high level of detail and representation, with Weta Workshop's motion capture performances showing again that it's amazing what technology and human performance can do.Overall, WFTPOTA is a satisfying conclusion that leaves the series on a high note, a perfecting ending that leaves fans satisfied. With Oscar worthy material (script, performance and direction) this film makes it establish itself as one of the best movies for the year, going not only bigger and better than Dawn but going so close to the dark and brutal Logan.P.S. Jay And Nick also see all the hate for this movie and it's always the same answer ""There is no war."" Don't go in expecting 1 hour of war scenes. The movie is about emotional depth and not war.4.5/5 - Nick 4/5 - Jay",War for the Planet of the Apes

Actually, I'll call this movie bad mediocre.You keep hoping for the first one and a quarter hours that something special will reveal itself but don't worry, it won't, you can rest assured that if you find yourself yawning, scratching, hoping it will end soon, that it won't do that either... it just goes on and on and on in dark, broody, miserable, depressing, nothingness with a bad dialogue to match.And the thing about the little girl... the apes kill her father but that doesn't seem to sink in... actually, this movie is just plain stupid, filled with silly blunders and ordinary acting. How the heck, after the brilliance of the other movies, did they get this one so wrong? And there's no war. Just a dark, broody mess and lots of blood and dead things. Save your money.

193,cdjh-81125,"Trilogy, Together, Strong",9,6 August 2017,"Before this trilogy came around I never really considered myself to be a Planet of The Apes fan but the trilogy has reinvested this franchise by being incredibly thought provoking as well as entertaining. Not only that but every entry in this trilogy has gotten considerably better than the last and War For The Planet of The Apes continued this tradition. The first and foremost thing to talk about with this film is Andy Serkis, when the first Oscar for a motion capture performance is given out he will be the one to receive it, he was truly amazing in this movie, he portrays Caesar in much darker and more bloody thirsty way in this film than he did the last two and pulls it off with style. Every motion-capture performance in this film is nothing less than exceptional, they feel like they are supposed to; like real walking, talking Apes and there is never a moment where you don't believe that they are. I have always loved Woody Harrelson and was very excited to see what he was going to bring to this character when given the opportunity to flex his villainous muscles. He absolutely nailed it, he was fantastic as the Colonel he brought a lot of strength to this character but also a lot of vulnerability and fear that he shows in his characters quieter scenes. It's also great that the writing for his character was very good, you come to understand his motivations for his actions which is always a necessity but I could see plenty of people agreeing with him, maybe not some of his actions but his reasoning itself is not entirely wrong. I loved that this film, like the past two before it, was not afraid to go to darker places when it needed to but neither Rise or Dawn went to the places that this film did. It almost felt like a holocaust movie at times with a lot of oppressive and fearful imagery that show that these films are not just blockbuster entertainment but serious, substance filled dramas that force there viewers to think while watching them. Matt Reeves was the perfect director for this film as well as Dawn, no disrespect to Rupert Wyatt, the director of Rise but I could not imagine anyone else nailing the direction of this film like he has. This film isn't as action-packed as one might expect but when it is he shows it in all its chaotic glory, never shying away from darker images that show the war in this film for what it is: needless violence. He's also excellent at framing that tell you a lot with single images. I have no issues with the fact this film chose not to be a non stop action experience but at the same time I do wish that this film would live up to its title more. I wanted to more see the scale and consequences of this conflict more but that is only truly shown in the first 20-30 minutes before Caesar sets out on his personal quest that was a great arc for this film but I do wish more time had been put into the conflict just to better show how much Caesar and his apes hated it and wanted to see it come to an end. War For The Planet of The Apes exceeded all my expectations, while it's not a war movie like the title would have you believe it's a much more heart felt and deeper Movie that asks questions of its audience. It has immaculate direction, framing and editing, a truly fantastic villain that plays perfectly of Caesar and another stunning performance from Andy Serkis that proves he has range like no other actor working today. 9.2/10-A (Phenomenal)",War for the Planet of the Apes
194,danielharden,Apes together Strong!,8,30 July 2017,"The Planet of the Apes franchise is no stranger to remakes, reboots, prequels, sequels and literally every kind of incarnation or adaptation a film franchise can have. Back in the late 60's, early 70's we got the original film, plus several sequels, then in 2001 we got whatever the hell Tim Burton made, and then in 2011, Rise of the Planet of the Apes started, what is by far the best prequel series ever, and has thus far been, one of cinema's greatest all time film trilogies. 2017 marks the end of this prequel series with the release of War for the Planet of the Apes, The third and final film in this phenomenal series and yet again Matt Reeves strikes gold.What is by far the films greatest strength, is its depiction of war. The film creates a very realistic representation of what a war is like. There are multiple different battles going on, between opposing sides and within the same sides. Apes clash with apes and humans clash with humans, the film doesn't depict a black and white version of a war, it knows war is more complex than that and respectably portrays this. The film also adds quite a lot of depth, depicting characters inner conflicts rather than just the physical ones seen in battle. This really added to Caesar's already established character and gives him even more of a character arc than he has already had. Not only does Caesar get added depth, but Woody Harrelson's Colonel is given a very intriguing and personal backstory. This really added to the films realistic presentation of a war, showing both sides as having their own inner struggles and presenting both as in some way human. This film packs an emotional punch which is surprising from a blockbuster franchise film, even if the last two films have been glorious.Matt Reeves excellently directs this film, depicting war realistically and respectably, while also making a nonstop, action packed movie that deals a great deal of emotional impact. War for the Planet of the Apes is extremely engaging and is an utter joy to watch, thanks to an action packed script and masterful directing, well done Matt Reeves. As well as Matt Reeves, Andy Serkis strikes gold once again as Caesar. The man is truly a pioneer of motion capture and a living acting legend because of it. The man plays Caesar again, but differently to how we have previously seen him. Serkis shines once again, nailing the deeper inner conflict of becoming Koba, consumed by hate, unable to forgive, as well as slipping back into the role of Caesar like a pair of comfortable shoes.To criticise this film is hard, the criticisms for this film fall into the nitpick domain of film criticism, but nonetheless I shall state them. The film is awfully predictable, but in all honesty, what do you expect from a blockbuster movie and franchise sequel? Most films can be predictable if you think hard enough. Also the human soldiers/security in this film are hilarious. In the latter part of the film, the human henchmen are used so conveniently to progress the plot, being so hilariously bad at their job. This does take away from the realism the film creates with its depiction of war, and occurs so frequently that it's comical. I constantly found myself thinking ""How have none of the humans seen this?"" and ""Are you seriously going to do that? You are a trained soldier!""To conclude, War for the Planet of the Apes is the ideal end for this fantastic film trilogy. Andy Serkis and Matt Reeves are phenomenal once again, one upping on their previous efforts. The film does have some dumb moments near the end to further the plot and is a bit predictable, but the realistic depiction of war and the brilliantly crafted, action packed movie, with an emotional motive, outshines all the criticisms or nitpicks with the film.

195,Sankari_Suomi,Now with extra apes!,7,15 October 2017,"Picking up where the previous movie left off, Apes of the War on the Planet of the War for the Planet of the Apes ('Now with extra apes!') finds Caesar lurking moodily in his woodland fortress as he plots the extermination of all human life.Some soldiers rock up, and there's a brief battle, which the apes win. Caesar interrogates the remaining soldiers and sends them back to their commander with a dark warning of further violence to come.The humans retaliate with an assassination attempt carried out by a bunch of guys from the Spec Ops franchise, who manage to ******** up their mission in ways that shouldn't even be possible.Enraged that they didn't send anyone remotely competent, Caesar vows to hunt down Corporal Woody Harrelson (played by Woody Harrelson) and exact his revenge. Accompanied by Luca (a gorilla), Rocket (a chimpanzee) and Maurice H. Evans (a gay orangutan) they they had off in the midst of a bitterly cold winter, with snow almost two metres deep.During their travels the apes find some random guy, murder him, and kidnap his daughter.Some other stuff happens and Caesar ends up captured by the Corporal, who forces him to join a work gang of about three dozen apes.Luca, Rocket, and Maurice hatch a plan to rescue Caesar and the five dozen apes.Despite being utterly reliant on deus ex machina, the plan succeeds under the most absurd circumstances (e.g. a soldier throws his life away by entering the apes' enclosure alone, without alerting anyone else of his intentions; other soldiers pay no attention to the fact that the apes have vanished from their enclosure; spotlights brighter than the sun somehow fail to reveal the apes walking freely all over the military base, etc.) and Caesar escapes with the six dozen apes just as a bunch of other humans attack.There's a brief fight during which half of the seven dozen apes are slaughtered, and the Corporal's men are all killed.An avalanche comes right out of nowhere and conveniently kills all the other human soldiers while leaving Caesar and his nine dozen apes untouched, because that's what Pierre Boule asked for and damn it, that's what he's going to get.Literally 24 hours later, Caesar leads his 1.5 million apes to a sun- bathed valley that is clearly basking in a temperate summer.Director Matt Reeves has been criticised for his controversial postmodern 'dry brush' colour palette, but I personally believe it was the right choice.I rate Apes of the War on the Planet of the War for the Planet of the Apes at 23.31 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a refreshing 7/10 on IMDb.",War for the Planet of the Apes

This movie barely has any action. The trailers and the title was hinting at a giant epic battle but in reality it is actually really small and it only lasts for about 5 minutes at the end.~The story started off great but halfway through, it suddenly become ""12 Years a Slave"" mixed with ""Passion of the Christ"" mixed with ""Schindler's List"" mixed with ""The Great Escape."" The second half drags on and on forever. It is extremely slow and they spent at least 45-60 minutes in this prison camp. There is only so much you can watch an ape get whipped and tortured before you end up getting bored.~The way the filmmakers decided to end the big battle at the end is a giant cop out. Throughout the movie they hint at a giant mass army of men who will come and attack. When the time does come, OUT OF NOWHERE an avalanche comes and ends the battle. It is one of the worst cop outs I have ever seen honestly.+) Andy is great as always, same with all of the character actors.+) Woody Harrison is great as always, but they end his story arc so sudden and it really leaves you empty inside.Overall I guess if you are a huge fan of Rise and Dawn (Like me, I saw Dawn 3x in theaters), you will want to see how they end Ceasar's arc. You will leave a little disappointed at the lost potential that a movie call ""WAR for the planet of the apes"" could have had.

197,Paynebyname,Brilliant CGI can't mask a weak story,5,16 July 2017,"Whilst I thought the film was better than the 2nd one, there were some flaws with it. The CGI was great, the ape characters including Caesar and bad ape were very relatable and the score was impressive.However, I do feel they wasted Woody after the impressive exposition scene with Caesar, there were some staggering security oversights to make up for some lazy story telling and a conclusion that felt forced and incredibly convenient. It wasn't really a war was it?Some might claim that I'm nitpicking when daring to challenge the security failings or the convenience of certain event but it's hardly nitpicking is it? It's fundamental to the film. The director should be trying to create a perilous situation for the audience to engage with. In this instance, that tension comes from a prison camp situation.However, if as a film maker you cast aside the dangerous illusion of imprisonment because it's suddenly inconvenient for your next scene, you are simply being inconsistent and lazy. It's about being taken on a story telling ride and when you are on that ride and moments of idiocy are thrown in to save time or effort, they stand out like a sore thumb.In the middle of the end fight the defending humans start firing at the escaping harmless apes, even though there is a greater human threat coming right at them with guns, vehicles and rocket firing helicopters.Again, this is to reinforce the tiresome one dimensional black and white simplicity that humans are bad and apes are good. Any complexity of thought or story are thrown away because explaining would be too hard.So lets's call it a war, market it as a war in all the posters but then when you don't deliver that label those that question this as nitpickers.One seriously has to question the ability of so many of these critics to evaluate story telling when they can be so easily swayed by some cracking CGI and a flower tucked behind the idea of a gorilla.The very first film expended the time in story telling to properly establish the origin of Caesar and how he came to be. Unfortunately crafting a decent solid script and story takes time. Making drama sensible and logical takes effort. That is why when Rupert Wyatt wanted longer to develop the script, the studio got him out and parachuted in Matt Reeves.But as this film and the second one demonstrates why take that extra time to craft something when so many critics/apologists swallow everything with zero questioning and total gullibility.This none moreso proved in the embarrassing defence of the killer avalanche that conveniently wipes out the remaining humans. 'Oh this is meant to be mother nature, didn't you get it stupid'.You come into a film like this thinking I wonder how the 'war' will play out, how will the humans lose and how will the apes rise - and what you get is a handy virus that makes us dumb and a killer avalanche. Really, that's the efforts of a couple of years of thinking about this? But as I've said if the critics are indicative of their salivating audience, why try any harder?Like the second film, I think once again people are so over awed by the effects for the apes that they are ignoring or papering over some of the holes and weaknesses in the story.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I understand that some people who enjoy Transformers movies and other brainless action films will get bored by the well told story that takes its time. But the CGI is wonderful, the score is one that I will remember for a very long time, and it should have been nominated for many more Oscars than it did.

200,troy-daniel-bush,Not bad but not great.,5,14 May 2021,"There are things I genuinely appreciate and like, but there's quite a bit holding it back.I like how this one focuses solely on the apes. The human characters in the previous films were boring. Although Gary Oldman in Dawn was awesome, because of course he was.The animation is flawless! No complaints there!There's some really nice cinematography. There's one shot in particular that is a nice little homage to Paths of Glory that I really appreciate.I like the idea of the rivalry between Caesar and the Colonel.The action scenes were decent.I'm all for the idea of keeping the war in the backdrop while the rest of it being character drama, but the character drama wasn't executed all that well. I'll get to that.Woody Harrelson was the perfect choice to play the Colonel. And he did a good job, because of course he did. And his character I like because you can argue that he's bad and you can also argue that he's good.The score was awesome.I like the idea of keeping things small in scale, but I wish it was done differently. Once again, I'll get to that.And, as expected, Andy Serkis was phenomenal. It's criminal that he hasn't gotten an Oscar nomination yet.Now, I have quite a few issues when it comes to the writing. Long story short there are so many things in this movie that don't make any sense. And there's tons of contrivances. I'm not going to list them all because there are a lot and I don't have the patience to list them all.I will however address what I said I would:Everything between the action scenes is honestly boring.Bad Ape was not funny.While I am all for the idea of keeping the war in the backdrop and having the central focus be character drama the character drama felt incredibly unearned.The movie really isn't true to its name. There's not much war going on. Why not have have some sort of like stalemate between Caesar's apes, the Alpha Omega's and the other human army? WW1 style, kind of. Then we can have the interactions between Harrelson and Caesar during a scene where they negotiate terms. People are dying of sickness and starvation and stuff. I don't know.Let the movie be a big fight between the three armies to keep things simple and small. Don't have it take place in this internment camp.",War for the Planet of the Apes
201,caelum-natura,"Great movie, showing that franchises can have a good continuation.",8,17 July 2017,"Great movie, showing that franchises can have a good continuation. Went to see this movie last night. Bought some big-ass popcorn and took my lady to a cinema to see this new ""apes stuff"". Little did we know she'll cry a bit at some parts, and I'll act like some sh*t fell into my eye just to keep all man-the-f-up vibe going on. OK, seriously now. This is well produced, well-made and quite emotional movie. From beginning to the end, it has well-balanced pace. Emotions, such as anger, sadness, joy etc. are not exaggerated and the viewer can get a good feeling about the entire situation, which makes this movie very enjoyable and watchable. Cesar is well developed as a character and you can compare him to a real person. He has sort of Denzel Washington vibe in my personal opinion, tho played by amazing Andy Serkis (do understand this is meant entirely as personality traits with deep respect to Mr. Washington as a person and actor.) Woody Harrelson does his part well. He is kind of an actor that comes into the picture, you never expect something big from him, but he always delivers his part and does it great. (Having 2012 in my mind for example).I do miss more of a backstory for some other characters. How, why etc. but that would make movie 5 hours long.CGI is well made, believable, the action is also well produced, well paced and there is this funny, goofy ape, played by excellent Steve Zahn, that brings just enough fun into the otherwise somewhat sad story, balancing the entire atmosphere.Most of all, I honestly think that director is a person than deeply condemns society and all we do in terms of war, destruction and everything humanity does. We are violent, self-important with complete disregard to consequences of our deeds. This is not ""save the monkeys"" babbling, but more of a rhetoric question ""why are we such a violent species?""I'm probably shooting far, but I see this movie it as a critique of the whole of humanity.Glad I saw this at the cinema.",War for the Planet of the Apes
202,joshbarton15,Caesar is home...,10,12 July 2017,"Maintaining such a high standard of quality throughout a franchise is one of the toughest challenges in filmmaking however, it's a challenge that War for the Planet of the Apes thrives on, going on to become the best of the Planet of the Apes reboot series. Growing in stature and intelligence, mirroring the journey of Caesar throughout the series, each film has delivered and in War for the Planet of the Apes, it has a stunning final chapter.Two years have passed since events in San Francisco shattered any chance of peace between humans and apes. The two species have been at war with each side suffering major losses. Wrestling with his darker instincts, Caesar (Andy Serkis) ventures out to confront the Colonel (Woody Harrelson), a man hellbent on wiping out Caesar and the rest of the apes.Opening with an incredibly tense sequence that sees a group of soldiers closing in on an ape trench where Caesar is hiding, War for the Planet of the Apes builds on the foundations laid by its two predecessors to deliver a film that never loses focus of its narrative, all while continuing to deliver spectacle in abundance. The strong narrative is a key feature of the series and War of the Planet of the Apes exceeded my expectations with the story it tells. The strained relationship between humans and apes is just the tip of the iceberg and, if you thought things got bad between the two in the previous films, you haven't seen anything yet.Caesar remains a focal point for this film and rightly so. We see the strength of Caesar as a leader of both the apes and a family but we also get to see the weakness he has of controlling his conflicting emotions towards humans, visions of Koba haunting him as he must decide what's best for the apes. The majority of the film is spent with the apes and it's a true testament to both the visual effects and the motion capture performances that the film is able to do this.Matt Reeves returns to direct this instalment and this is easily his most accomplished piece of work yet, beating the stellar work he did on Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Whether it's building tension, evoking emotion or delivering pulsating action, Reeves delivers plenty of memorable moments to go with some of the great moments in the series. Reeves' film is accompanied by the outstanding visual effects that have grown better and better with each film, some breathtaking cinematography from Michael Seresin and Michael Giacchino's score that brilliantly accentuates the interchange of emotions throughout.Coming to the performances, War for the Planet of the Apes continues the groundbreaking work done with motion capture performance throughout the series. Andy Serkis is once again superb in the role of Caesar, giving arguably his best performance to date, conveying such a range of emotion phenomenally well. The time has come for Serkis to get the recognition he deserves with some awards nominations because what he does with the character of Caesar is nothing short of spectacular. Serkis is joined by the returning Karin Konoval as Maurice and Terry Notary as Rocket, who both continue the solid work they've done before in the series. It's new character Bad Ape, played by Steve Zahn, that will no doubt steal the show for many people, his eccentricity and likability making him such a stand out from the rest of the ape characters. He comes with a lot of humour and I think they pitched it perfectly, Bad Ape not becoming annoying or unfunny at any point. I was looking forward to Woody Harrelson's presence in the film and, while I thought he was very good as the Colonel, I was genuinely surprised at the direction his character went, and I'm sure I won't be the only one.Closing out a trilogy is never easy but the final moments of War for the Planet of the Apes is one of those times where there is nothing but silence from the audience out of sheer captivation and respect. It's a stunningly triumphant final chapter in what has to go down as one of the greatest trilogies in cinematic history.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Isn't PETA going to say something?Also, the apes used in this movie have unusually long torsos. They look unnatural.As for plots, it is full of plot holes. So don't think too hard when watching.The Nova character is completely unnecessary. I thought something important was going to happen with her, but nothing. They could easily delete this character and fill her role with someone else.Basically they run out of good plot but want to milk this planet of ape idea.

I watched this film because I had a few hours to kill and assumed that it would be a crappy sequel/ continuation to the previous film (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) which I didn't like at all. How wrong could I have been! The film was just amazing... from start to finish, it was captivating and dark, and cold, and sad, and emotional. Thoroughly enjoyable viewing IMO and like MonaK reviewed, how the hell does an awful, idiotic, laughable, nonsense film like Spiderman Homecoming get a (currently) similar rating of 7.7???!!! This film was an epic. I think the first 10 I've given, or rather, the first movie I felt strong enough to review and give a 10. Absolutely recommend this film to be watched, for the story, the action, the effects, the emotions and other great thing!",War for the Planet of the Apes
205,barbagvido,"These days, it's very risky to make a dark, serious blockbuster and I respect this film for that alone.",9,28 November 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a third movie in the new Planet of the Apes prequel series. It's once again directed by Matt Reeves who also directed the previous one and stars Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson and Steve Zahn as Caesar faces the humans once more.It's a very powerful movie. Very grim, very serious and it absolutely works. Since today almost every blockbuster we get is an action comedy, this felt very refreshing. Just like Dawn, this one has very powerful anti-war themes and some human nature allegories. That's what I love about these prequels. They took a familiar story and focused on its themes more than ever before in order to bring a powerful, emotional story. This one was more emotional than its predecessors, but I liked Dawn of the Planet of the Apes more because the story felt more complete. This one has a mostly pretty good story, but the character of a little girl Nova felt a bit shoehorned in since she served almost no purpose to the plot except showing the effects of a Simian flu on humans and one little bit at the end, but that's it. These may be valid enough reasons for some, but they weren't for me. Also, the pacing sometimes felt a bit off. Like they should have taken more time with the journey around the first half of the movie. It felt really rushed and some emotional moments should have been more of a punch. And then, when we get to this place they were heading for, it really slows down. I liked the Holocaust allegories and all, but as much as the imagery and brutality helped establish some things, the plot didn't go anywhere for a while. I didn't feel these things with Dawn and that's why I thought Dawn was perfect. But these flaws still don't prevent the movie from provoking emotions. This is one of the most emotional blockbusters I've seen. It really reduces the action until the very end and replaces it with a genuine, heartfelt war drama.It's a fitting and epic end to a great trilogy. While only a few flaws make it slightly pale when compared to its predecessor (but it's better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes), it's the most emotional one of the bunch.",War for the Planet of the Apes
206,paulijcalderon,"The best blockbuster in a while! Not perfect, but still a great one",8,12 July 2017,"I never expected to witness such a grim and dark film with the protagonist being a speaking ape. The visual effects are truly beyond words. I'm amazed by how far it's gotten since ""Rise"". The movie looks incredible but I fear it might be too much to handle at parts. The opening act is among the best I've seen in cinema this year. I was genuinely affected and engaged. The premise is fantastic with such great world building that you are instantly transfixed. The problem I have is that it starts to drag later on. There's nothing wrong with establishing an emotional connection because the first few dramatic scenes are dark, real and flawless. But at a point you get just a few too many drawn out dramatic scenes after each other. At first I was really into it, but that aspect started to get a little exaggerated. You feel It's on the borderland of being over- dramatic. It's annoying because that kept me from getting invested all the way through. Luckily, that's my only real problem with the movie. The rest is jaw-drooping.Andy Serkis as Caesar goes through much conflict here and it's almost impossible not to feel for him. You see it all by just the look of his eyes. I'm stunned by how well it's handled. Woody Harrelson's Colonel is on the same antagonist level as Koba, if not better. I got major ""Apocalypse Now"" vibes from his character which is pretty fitting since we are dealing with a war that is going completely out of hand. The action sequences are brutal and masterfully directed. It's a pity that we only get so few portions of them. The symbolism is strong here as well. It's pretty much the ape holocaust with them being trapped in concentration camps. So, it's that type of war movie we are treated with. Not an action packed one, but a more silent and slower paced one. It's a gritty version of ""The Great Escape"" meets a tone you'd see in ""Come and See"", but with apes.The movie could have picked up more momentum/energy by the middle act, since I did feel that we hit a part where things slowed down. I understand what type of movie they were going for, so It's not necessarily a bad thing to be slower. I unfortunately found it disappointing because the first act lead me to believe it was building up to an extreme conclusion. If you enjoy dark war dramas you'll like this. It's is still loads better than most blockbuster movies nowadays. I like that it takes itself seriously and doesn't dumb itself down. It's by no means a bad movie at all. Far from it. I'm digging deep to explain why I didn't love it as much as I wanted to. My expectations were too high. I'll see if it gets better on re-watch. It's a masterpiece if we only look at it technically with the visuals. It just didn't reach the same levels of engagement as the previous installments. I will leave you with this though; Together with the first two films we have a solid trilogy with each chapter being good. That's still a great thing to be able to say! A solid trilogy indeed.",War for the Planet of the Apes
207,bravesfanc,Don't go in thinking it's a full blown action movie,9,23 July 2017,"While the word ""War"" is in the title for this third installment of the franchise, it's not a full of numerous scenes of action. There's one at the beginning and one at the end. In between the opening and the climax, we follow Ceasar and a few other apes on a journey to find the man that killed his wife and son.For me personally, I enjoyed every minute of journey. Along the way they pick up a young girl who isn't able to speak, and another ape who goes by ""bad ape"" played by Steve Zahn. I thought his performance was awesome and he was the comedic relief to what was a mostly serious movie throughout.I've read other reviews saying that ""Man"" are portrayed as the villains, and that it should be the other way around. That we shouldn't be caring about the apes. Maybe in the real world, I would feel that way, but in this movie, ""Man"" is what kept this war going. After the first battle scene, Ceasar lets a few survivors live as an act of mercy, this only backfires as the survivors are able to pinpoint Ceasar's hidden location which ends up getting his wife and son murdered.Even at almost 2 1/2 hours and minimal action scenes, I loved this movie. The apes relationships with each other and with the young girl they find are awesome. Woody Harrelson plays the main bad guy but even he has a reason behind his motives that might make sense to a few people. His scenes with Ceasar are intense, although I was a bit disappointed how is story ended. Either way, this was one of the best so far this year for me. 9/10",War for the Planet of the Apes

What threw me off was that this wasn't the film I was expecting it to be. Its title can be misleading; there is no war. There are actually very few action sequences. This is not the battle to decide the fate of the planet. When you hear the title ""War for the Planet of the Apes"", you have a certain image in your head. You envision apes versus humans, in a war that will annihilate most of the human species, and leave the apes in control of the planet.

And then to show the REAL us, the evil humans, and how we slaughter that poor family.

213,Rawal_Afzal,The disappointment of the Planet of the Apes!!! A three-year wait ends on a sad note!,6,5 August 2017,"As was the case with my cousin who (went in to watch a film at a cinema for the first time and) hadn't watched the first and the second film of the series, anyone watching this film as his first from it will be awestruck and really the way this film depicts the relation and the conflict between humans and apes, but I and those from my family had watched them and were, in a nutshell, disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the film uses great philosophies to depict the nature and the mercilessness of such circumstances, the dialogues and the emotions are indeed very touching, but the film lacks twists or a proper plot, has countless flaws (in our view at least), and I'm sorry to say, is in parts boring. Talking of the first of the flaws which could've still made a much better despite the issues was the intervention from the third party - the army that arrived. Needlessly, it makes it a triangle affair and drifts itself from its main theme of it after all being between apes and humans. So a better and a powerful ending would've left a better taste in mouth, because here the apes were completely robbed off their intelligence all of a sudden and were simply shown to have been just lucky due the attack by that army. The previous two films had certainly set higher standards of the apes.Talking of standards, the biggest weakness of the film yet lies in the brutal murder that it causes of the legend of Caesar before he finally dies. It completely ruins the character of the greatest leader ever presented in an English films. Far from being a man of morals and a leader with a great foresight, a peace-loving being, the film in the end declares Koba as the winner and as being someone who was always right in his campaign that Caesar wasn't necessarily a great ape, but just lucky, unlike Koba, to have instead received love from humans. As soon as he got a raw deal like Koba did, he resorts to being after all yet another Koba-like ape. Surely, as someone with even more experience and having grown into a wise, old ape, this could've been the ultimate opportunity to show that Caesar was never going to resort to settling grudges, and cared more for the community. A wasted opportunity, an incredibly sad end to a legend like him.Also, the 3D effects are grossly over-rated, many films have had them better, and don't form the basis of the film by any stretch of the imagination - as do the sound effects for example in 'Dunkirk' 2017.I'm personally undecided on a sequel, and a bit skeptical too. My advice would be to not to tarnish the legacy of the series if something similar to the first or the second installment can't be repeated - because despite this one, it'll in my books still go down as the greatest series of English films.Not the fault of the film-makers here, but I myself and we as a family have had a very strong kind of emotional attachment to this series, because it was the second installment of the year 2014 that led me to watch films at cinemas. Three years to that and I've watched 47 different films and 49 shows. For someone otherwise completely confined to his home and who only steps out to visit doctors, that means really a lot. A three-years wait came to a sad end.Regardless, for now though, this goes down as the biggest disappointment of the year - an honour divided into halves by it and 'Alien: Covenant'.And oh', by the way, how was that bad colonel ever going to get a wall build above which even the army's planes and helicopers weren't going to fly in?

I love how his opinions on humans have been shaped by his past experiences - it much improves his character in my opinion. The visual effects are still fantastic - but more than that, the direction from Matt Reeves is just stunning. The action scenes are so fluidly shot that they are a joy to watch, and there are so many beautiful shots that really took my breath away. The Colonel is a great antagonist with understandable motives, but who you still want to get killed by the end. The action is a bit sparse, and I can understand why people wouldn't like that, but I think this is what separates this franchise from other blockbuster franchises - it really does care about developing its characters above anything and everything else. The action scenes, when they do arrive, are really great, and the ending legitimately had me tearing up a bit.

Andy Serkis' portrayal of Caesar is excellent, and though his character does not converse much, there is much emotion and power in all his actions, and speech. Woody Harrelson, a talented actor himself, provides a good foil to Serkis' Caesar, and chews every scenery he is in. The drama and tension is brilliantly played. The score adds to the atmosphere and tension, making every minute of the movie count. The cinematography is breathtaking and the sprawling scenery provides visual pleasure to an otherwise serious movie. There are enough lighthearted moments, and action spectacle to keep audiences engaged till the end. In short, this movie works because of its focus on the characters, score, and cinematography.

217,annuskavdpol,Lord of the Rings Cinematic,9,31 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a movie that classic movie-goers will love. There were so many great things about this movie. But most of all the movie was more or less a cliché to all Western Hollywood movies. It had the ingredients of all the best movies out there. For example, in the Lord of the Rings, they use tall and strong black horses and in this movie they use tall and dark horses to gallop along the beaches stretched with forests and oceans on either side. The Lord of the Rings was filmed in New Zealand whereas this movie was filmed on Vancouver Island, the place where I live. In this movie there was a blurring of both good and bad and what is considered moral and immoral and there is a clear cross over between what is or should be considered ethical and what not. In a round about way, the Director of this movie plays this in a form of Marvel Comic Fantasy mixed with Hollywood philosophy to weave together a plot that could outrage the audience in the theater. But it does not. When the humans, who look like drones in Star Wars movies, get wiped out by an avalanche in the end of the movie: the audience in the theater does not express any type of dismay. Instead they all remained completely silent, as if to say, ""maybe the Apes are more evolved after all."" This then leads us to believe this movie is both a dystopia and a utopia at the same time. A dystopia because the human race is destroyed and a utopia because through Darwin's Natural Selection, we were all replaced by a more evolved species, which was perhaps, an intrinsic human spirit element which ends up supersedes the humans and jumps to another species.",War for the Planet of the Apes
218,Equalizer16,Pure Passion Narrative,9,15 July 2017,"The third instalment in the new planet of the Apes films erupts in raw power and emotion in a strong story of conflict, and nature.Five years after the events of Dawn (2014), the war between humans and apes continues till the point when ape leader Caesar (Andy Serkis) hid own journey of vengeance to end the conflict and find solace for the rest of the apes.Matt Reeves has shown again, you can take a very blockbuster plot line, and turn it into an intelligent creation of substance story and character over constant loud noises and terrible writing (the Michael Bay approach). The number one drive throughout the film is the passion that the director, producers, and writers have for the narrative, which makes it much more than a summer blockbuster.Continuing to do what he does best Serkis owns the motion capture performance, and shines more than ever as Caesar in this instalment. Delivering a perfect balance of ape and human character in one making sensational moments of emotion through his own eyes. Being one of the essential aspects of Reeves directing: 100% character. As well as Serkis, the remaining ensemble motion capture characters mixing a great range of personalities, especially from the comic relief of Bad Ape (Steve Zahn), to silent but wise Maurice (Karin Konoval). Woody Harrison also classically performs the evil Colonel but with much more depth.Its an overwhelming atmosphere of powerful passionate story-telling carrying strong human emotion reflecting man's nature, but at the heart if Serkis phenomenal performance of soul and spirit. 9/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
219,mitchell5954,Worthy Final Chapter,9,17 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is the third installment of this reboot POTA trilogy, though there could easily be more. This is a series of films that I initially didn't care, but grew to really enjoy. The first film, Rise, I still think is just okay. It's definitely not bad, but I find it heavily overrated. However, the second movie, Dawn, I love, and think is vastly superior to its predecessor. The effects, story, and characters are all better, and the dynamic between Caesar and Koba is just brilliant. So I was hyped for this movie before it came out. Does it live-up to the hype? Yes.I still think Dawn is the best of the movies, but this is definitely a worthy sequel and final installment of this franchise, or at least this portion of it. This has been an interesting trilogy. Usual in these big franchises the first movie is good, the second is just as solid, if not better, and the third installment is the weakest. In this case the first film is the weakest, the second is best, and the third is really good. The only other trilogy I know that has played out like this has been the Captain America trilogy.The end of Dawn set-up the final war between the humans and the apes. War takes place a couple years after Dawn where the apes are trying to find a way out of the forest and into a new land where they can call home. Before he can do that though Caesar seeks revenge against Woody Harrelson's character, the Colonel. The first half is essentially a journey of revenge for Caesar, and the second is an escape movie.This film does almost everything right. The effects are stunning. Dawn is overall a better film to me, but when it comes to the effects War takes the cake. People raved about Rise's effects when it came out. War makes the effects in that look almost amateurish.Caesar remains the best part of this franchise (along with Koba). He's an amazing character, and has come so far from his humble beginnings in Rise. If you come into this movie wanting constant action you will be disappointed on that front. The title and trailers are a bit misleading. This is more of a dreary drama for Caesar and the apes with some action in the beginning and end.The first and third acts are amazing, especially act one. The first act feels like a dreary post-apocalyptic film like The Road. It's moody, dark, and very atmospheric with minimal music. The music used enhances the dreary atmosphere. The third act confrontation is also great. Possible spoiler; the very end reminded me of the ending to Exodus in the Bible. I get the feeling that was intentional. It was a good way to wrap-up Caesar's story.There are a couple issues I have that prevent this from being a perfect movie. Firstly, the second act, with the apes imprisoned, did drag on a bit too long in my opinion. It was still good, and there were some good interactions with the humans and apes, to be honest there were times where I got a little bored and was waiting for some real progression. In Dawn I was never bored. Each scene in that film was engaging and felt necessary. They also threw-in some humor that didn't quite work. Fortunately, there was not much of that.They also threw in a new ape character who was basically the comic relief, but he didn't annoy me that much. Also, his presence provided the main character, and by extension the audience, with some interesting world building.Lastly the villain, Woody Harrelson, while good, was a disappointment. This is mainly because both the trailers and the film itself hyped this guy up to no tomorrow to be Caesar's ultimate nemesis, but he really wasn't. Koba is still the best villain in this franchise (and one of my favorite villains period). On a side note I liked how Koba is both in the film and not in it at the same time. I really liked how the film utilized Koba, which is what drove Casear's arc in this.The colonel was still a decent villain who you can understand his motivations, and Woody Harrelson gives a good performance, but he was ultimately nothing. I do like the twist the film did with the virus, which ties into the ending with the colonel, but it still felt a bit anticlimactic given the hype.Overall, War for the Apes was a satisfying conclusion to the Caesar trilogy. If you liked the previous two installments this one won't disappoint. The thing is, even though this trilogy is done, they could easily make many more films and play in this universe, much like Star Wars, if they wanted. I have a feeling they will too.",War for the Planet of the Apes
220,DrTuvok,CGI Monkey Soap Opera,2,14 April 2020,"Watching this movie I couldn't help but wonder what would happen to the apes if their horses suddenly got the idea to overthrow their authority; because having two full sized apes riding one horse is more animal abuse than Michael Cimino could dig up in the entire filming of Heaven's Gate.If I couldn't help thinking about these ridiculous things, it was because so little was happening story-wise for nearly the entire movie. It began as a standard revenge story, which, if done rightly, can still be engaging, but the problem director Matt Reeves has here is that he decided to make the main character, Caesar, a model ape who never leaves his bubble of innate goodness. There is no moral dilemma which most revenge stories at least dabble in. Instead Reeves manages to stretch this plod out for over two hours, stuffing it full of overwrought emotions, unbearably slow ape dialogs, and hazy philosophical nonsense. The second movie in this trilogy (the only watchable thing Matt Reeves has directed so far) was far more interesting for depicting a struggle where neither side was really right, but this one just paints an 'all apes are good, all humans are bad' picture. I don't have a problem with good versus evil stories, but since I have a hard time seeing all human beings as inherently evil, it doesn't really work. What happened to the Charlton Heston movie where the apes were seen cruelly hunting humans down as vermin? No one knows. What happened to the satiric edge these movies used to have that even Tim Burton's maligned remake held on to? No one knows. Why is this movie taking itself so seriously when it's about CG apes taking over the world? Who knows. Why are the humans surrounded by religious imagery? Because Matt Reeves apparently likes to fantasize about eradicating religions he doesn't like. Where's the war? We get a couple of small-scale fight scenes, but that's all.And the national anthem scene was beyond stupid. I guess Reeves thought he was really clever in equating monkeys with abused indigenous people or whatever he was trying to do, but it was just disgusting. Besides, the USA is insulted left and right all the time by Hollywood. If Reeves really wanted to be really edgy maybe he should have attacked Communist China, a country which only gets pandered to...Many of the positive reviews on this site are attacking those criticizing this movie as uneducated rubes who know nothing about film. Therefore I think I need to clear myself. If you want an action movie, watch John Woo's the Killer or Hard Boiled. If you want action merged with story, watch Mel Gibson's Braveheart, Apocalypto, or Hacksaw Ridge. If you want a psychological thriller, watch Frankenheimer's Manchurian Candidate, Seconds, or any of Hitchcock's films. (Strangers on a Train is my personal favorite). If you want a biblical movie, watch the Charlton Heston Ben-Hur, the Robe, or Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. If you
Want to see expert cinematography and lighting, see Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. If you want an epic or a war film, try the David Leans, the LOTR trilogy, Kurosawa's Ran, Kubrick's Paths of Glory, Patton, or even the Last Samurai. If you want something newer, try Ridley Scott's the Martian, anything by Chris Nolan, or the Mission Impossible series. If you want a revenge story, you could watch Tarantino, or even better, read the Count of Monte Cristo, probably the best revenge story I've come across. There are so many other things better than this movie, and this one is too pretentious to even be a guilty pleasure.",War for the Planet of the Apes
221,alistairc_2000,Skirmish of the planet of the apes.,1,14 July 2017,"Pierre Boulle the French novelist wrote Planet of the Apes (Originally The Monkey Planet). A classic SF novel. In 1968 it was filmed and so started the cinematic journey which leads to this. I watched Battle for the Planet of the apes as a young man. I thought that this movie was going to be along the same lines as that movie. After all, all of the trailers pitch it as a war between the apes and man. I was really looking forward to it. I liked the last two movies. They were not as good as the original series but were still interesting SF movies in their own right. Also, everything has been better than the Tim Burton Planet of the apes.So I put on my 3d glasses and sat down in Wood Green London to watch the war that would change the face of the planet. So there is a brief skirmish. Then the head ape Corny (as the plot is) sets out to find those responsible for doing wrong to him (yawn). Bring on the WAR I thought. Then they ride around for a bit. Next, we get Escape from Colditz, the great escape or Prison Break. I am still waiting for the promised war. At that end, there is a battle. Not against the apes as they are all escaping. Though unfortunately none of them get on a motorcycle and try to jump over barriers.I walked out of the cinema and thought what a pile of dung.The 3d is pathetic. Really this is a movie that could have been good in 3d but wasn't. It is at least 40 minutes too long. Also, it is not the movie they promised. There are no wars in it. It is littered with mistakes. My favourite is the 350-pound gorilla on a horse. No, that horse would have been dead.Lastly and this is my normal grump. Why did it not say it was based on Planet of the apes by Pierre Boulle? No mention of him in this shamefully bad movie.I really wanted to like this movie.

I can see/sympathise with Caesar and the ape's plight. While I can also see The human's perspective, and can see where they're coming from. No one is a villainous cartoon character, just fragile people in a bad situation.Maurice, Roket, and Koba get their time to shine and all are good, especially Rocket & Maurice.Woody Harrelson gives a chilling performance as the Colonel watching him and Caesar interact is very entertaining.I really loved this movie and I think it's the perfect book end to this trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Because it has some extremely well handled dramatic moments in it, boasting visually stunning cinematography and masterful acting to carry it off. War Of The Planet Of The Apes is not just about the horror about the battle of war, it's also about the revolutionary shouts from the people being affected by it, in this case the apes. It's an emotional roller- coaster, except instead of over-done sentimentality it displays raw emotion to get into the viewer watching the film. War Of The Planet Of The Apes, in my opinion, marks as the best of the Planet Of The Apes prequel trilogy and while it isn't as good as the 60's Planet Of The Apes it remains a boasting, powerful epic despite that, proudly declaring itself in pride. Listening to the film boom over the speakers of the cinema is incredible, and the experience for this film won't be the same if you just watch it on your TV...see it at the cinema before it's too late!",War for the Planet of the Apes
227,shweta-51657,Apes together Strong,7,14 July 2017,"I went into the movie without watching the trailers, and damn, am I glad.The visuals were downright amazing! Every scene, every shot captured with purpose and beauty. The movie has come a long way in visuals. The scenes of the apes stronghold at the beginning of the movie are absolutely insane. The shot of the waterfall right in the backdrop, was so beautiful it was hard to take my eyes of it and concentrate on the plot unfolding. While we are discussing visuals, it has to be pointed out that this movie NEEDS to be nominated for best graphics. The conversion of the actors playing apes onto the large screen as apes, is nothing short of fantastic. It is soo easy to allow yourself to believe these were not actors under masks but actual captured and trained animals (I'm coming off mentally unhinged here, I realise) acting out a part. Woody Harrelson as the Colonel was a nice surprise as well. The sheer hatred the audience has for him in the first 30 mins of the movie sets the pace of his arc in this movie. His arc also introduces a nice subplot that needs questions answered.Andy Serkis. What can we possibly say that gets this man his Oscar? (They need to give him a Lifetime achievement award) This is probably his 4th time playing a lead character while donning CGI (LOTR, King Kong, Star Wars previously). He has brought the character to life once again. It is hard enough to have to act in front of the green screen, yet this man seems to bring an ape to life with such ease, its downright astonishing. The movie does seem awfully long but with with incredible plot, the execution of said plot, the visuals, the movie is well watched. I don't know where this newly rebooted franchise is going but it should come full circle to the classic eventually and I am sticking around to see that happen. You should too.",War for the Planet of the Apes
228,feyipuk,A conclusion that could have concluded sooner,7,13 June 2018,"After building up Caesar and the other apes in the first two films, this third one seems so contrived - especially the last twenty minutes - it almost ruins what is otherwise an interesting film. 
Here, the super smart chimpanzee, his family and all the other primates that supported him on the last movie are up against an American Colonel (Woody Harrelson), his assortment of monkey hating soldiers - so not much change to the previous films - and also ""Donkeys""; apes who support the humans. All have complicated relationships which the film could have developed further, rather than the cliched ending that went from action to completion faster than a monkey up a tree.Obviously, the special effects are amazing. The interaction between human and ape are pretty flawless. Nova (Amiah Miller) may get shoe horned into the film, but the way she is able to interact with Maurice (Karin Konoval) is pretty impressive. And watching Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) careen around with his extremely expressive is a comic interlude from all the serious activities going on on the screen.For the most part, the film was alright. Right up until after the Colonel has probably the longest spoken scene in the film (which isn't hard when you know only one ape can talk, though all the apes can understand English), it moved at a good pace. It just seemed like the producers then felt they needed to wrap it up in a nice, complete manner, which maybe wasn't needed.",War for the Planet of the Apes
229,Marx_Bros_Fan86,An Excellent Finish to a Great Trilogy,8,24 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes Matt Reeves' conclusion to his Apes trilogy is a surprisingly emotional story of the last stand between the humans and the apes. The war that started in the previous film is still raging on, as the humans have become increasingly desperate. The virus that made the apes highly intelligent has mutated and the humans have not discovered a cure. The virus now degrades humans' intelligence and abilities, destroying their ability to speak. Caesar (Andy Serkis), our protagonist from the last two films, simply wants peace, but the mad Colonel McCullough, played by Woody Harrelson, has different ideas. He goes on an ape-murdering rampage that sends Caesar on a revenge trip. Caesar and a few choice friends, including the orangutan Maurice, decide to kill McCullough for justice and for their own safety.It would have been easy for War for the Planet of the Apes to fall into a generic revenge flick or war movie formula, but instead, Reeves delivers a complex, emotional conflict between two desperate species that are struggling to survive. Caesar's conflict with Koba from the last movie still lingers as Caesar struggles between the paths of peace and war. Just how far will his hate take him? McCullough, on the other hand, desperately wants to contain the spread of the virus and decides to kill all humans that exhibit symptoms, all while imprisoning the apes that threaten the human race's position on the top of the food chain. You can almost understand where McCullough is coming from. Threat of extinction is a scary thing. What would humanity do if ever faced with such a problem? You can bet there would be people like McCullough. Perhaps that is what made the experience hit home for me – as fantastical as the plot is, the despicable way humans behave rings true. What leaves the viewer on the side of the apes is their general dislike of violence, their acceptance of humans with the virus, and the value they place on preserving their own kind, traits the humans do not seem to share.The movie is deliberately paced and isn't really action packed. It takes its time exploring moral conflicts and developing the story. The action scenes it does have are high caliber and it goes out with a real bang. The special effects are among the best you will see in theaters this year. If they don't get a visual effects Oscar, nobody deserves it.The performances are excellent. Andy Serkis mimics ape movement perfectly and his voice is freakishly ape like. Woody Harrelson proves once again that he can do no wrong – he's always a pleasure to see, and he excels in the Colonel Kurtz like role. Also noteworthy is the child actress Amiah Miller as Nova, a mute girl, and she doesn't disappoint.I was most impressed with just how emotional the whole experience was. Deaths in the movie really hit you, and the musical score really tugs at your heart strings. Perhaps the saddest thing for this viewer was observing how the human race more or less turned on itself so easily. All too easy to believe.With War for the Planet of the Apes, I believe Reeves delivered the most consistently good trilogy since the Lord of the Rings. I think if you like sci-fi movies that take time to tell a story, develop characters, and explore themes, you will like this movie. If you expect a conventional action movie, you will be disappointed. I'm glad we got the former. Who needs more conventional action movies? Not me.",War for the Planet of the Apes
230,texshelters,"""War of the Planet of the Apes"" successfully concludes the trilogy.",8,14 July 2017,"War For the Planet of the ApesWith ""War for the Planet of the Apes"", the great ape trilogy reaches an epic conclusion. ""War of the Planet of the Apes"" successfully concludes the trilogy, and it also concludes the formula, hopefully. The plot elements used in film three have become familiar. You've got your good human and your bad human, your good ape and your bad ape, your peace lovers and your war mongers, your clever moves and your great escapes. You learn once more about how we are like apes and the apes are like us. It is played out. Still, it is done well in ""War"" and I don't mind one bit. However...The film is too full of coincidences for me to fully love. Many of the great escapes were as much about luck as it was skill or intellect. At other times, the motivations of the Colonel are unclear in ""War"" and it would have taken one or two lines of well placed dialogue to fix that. We know why he is going after the apes, but his other actions remain an enigma. What the writers may have relied on was the stereotype of the rogue military officer with no motivation required. Too bad, because it taints a good performance by Woody Harrelson. Nova, the human girl, also lacks a back story and we never learn about where she was living and whom it was that she was living with. Did she care? Why did she take so well to the apes? Was it just that she was an innocent and thus adaptable? Though slightly underdeveloped, the Colonel has some of the best dialogue in the film, and I am not just talking about the line about the ""Planet of the Apes"" from the trailer. The film pivots on the Colonel, as films often do with antagonists. Without the Colonel, there is no plot and no climax; the Colonel is why Caesar is propelled into action. Caesar goes through every emotion: sadness, grief, anger even happiness. Well, more anger and grief than happiness, but we see him feel happiness when he is with his family. Serkis does the facial expressions for Caesar so well he's almost human. Seriously, he great and it's a powerful achievement making us sympathize more for Caesar than most characters in film these days. The visuals are compelling and the settings are filmed well, capturing both their intimacy and power. The music doesn't interfere and the moments of silence in the film play to great affect. Serkis isn't the only motion capture star in the film. The rest of the actors as apes do well, and Karin Konoval as the orangutan Maurice, is particularly skilled. Rating: Pay Full Price ""War of the Planet of the Apes"" won't go down in history as a groundbreaking film or one of the best films ever, but for my money, it's a great film to see in the summer heat. Will their be more ape films? Here's a clue: Caesar's son is named Cornelius. That name should be familiar to long time Ape fans. PS: I saw the film in 3D and it didn't enhance my viewing experience. Unless you are a huge fan of 3D, regular resolution on a big scene is fine. Peace, Tex Shelters",War for the Planet of the Apes

232,urthpainter,everyone who gave this film a 1* rating?,9,25 July 2017,"Seriously needs to reevaluate the criteria by which they review films. Why? Because giving this film 1/10 says, ""I am ignorant of quality film making."" Descriptions like slow and boring just don't cut it! Opinions like this are an act of ultimate laziness - the inability to mentally invest in the passive experience of a film. An inability to invest in a well made film that has something to say no less.Everyone has the right to an opinion - but when a person abandons merit before their eyes, and quality film making is overlooked by choice? That is simply, unfortunate. I can continue to admonish those without taste, but what good is that?War for the Planet of the Apes isn't a good movie - it's a Great movie!!! I thought part one was above average, part two was surprisingly good - but this movie? Its a borderline classic!In a nutshell, War for the Planet of the Apes is a struggle for survival between Caesar's group of sentient apes (gorillas, orangutans), and a derelict group of soldiers led by a broken/crazed leader. This fight begins as open warfare but moves to very close quarter survival between captors and prisoners. There is a lot of heavy, dramatic sequences - and I would say this movie compromises entertainment for meaningful content. Normally I am very critical of this type of film, but not this time! Everything serves the characters and story - and in doing so becomes a project that far exceeds the sum of its parts. Yes this movie has death, suffering and plight - and it also has heroism, empathy and displays the strength of unity.The effects are astonishing - and immediately allow the viewer to slip into the world in a believable way. It is possible that this movie is 5 years ahead of its time. It may be a while before another film achieves this level of drama, all while being a heavily effect driven experience.Apparently this movie requires an active viewer. A person actually has to show up, absorb the content of a film that will not pander to selfish, ""give me action"" needs. More science fiction should be this brave and literate. I love movies that ask interesting questions and can bring you on an emotional adventure. It is surprising to me that the third film in this trilogy would improve so much on the previous two films - good movies in their own right.Way more I could talk up: great soundtrack! The music both blends in and adds to the drama/action - the best kind of soundtracking - beautiful camera work in interesting locations, and several unique characters, many of whom never utter a word of dialog! This movie is full of great character building, and all the big moments really land where they should.For me, best movie of the 2017 summer - maybe the year!All the 1* reviews at IMDb are a mystery... audience approval for this movie isn't this low.

234,midge56,Great Series... Bad ending,7,13 November 2017,"I've loved the Planet of apes movies since the very first original. This is one of the few reboot series film which is improved from the early version (technically speaking); although you still can't compete with Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowell. Although Andy Serkis is neck & neck.However, what kind of morons kill off their star & then whine because their sales has dropped? Talk about ignorant & out of touch. No one will appreciate killing off their favorite character unless it was a true history situation.Shades of George Lucas, JJ Abrams & Veronica Roth. Has everyone forgotten the uproar when Rowling was going to kill off Harry Potter? The Prime minister, Royal family & half the stars in Hollywood got involved to beg her not to do it. Like many authors, they grow to hate their own creations & try to kill them off to end the series. Rowling gave in but slaughtered everyone else including the owl & broom to get even.Do they think Star Trek fans were pleased to have Vulcan destroyed & the timeline scrambled on the horrible reboot? They only made money because it was all there was. We hated what they did.This is the problem with Caesar's demise. Film 4 will crash & burn unless they bring him back & have a positive theme other than the boring war which has gone on for 3 films. The first was great. The other 2 apes war films were battle OD punishment. We want to see progress in building their world. No more battling humans. How they mix with the new humans without Koba hate or the original series or Roth reboot gorilla war or radiation mutant mindset. Stop listening to the opinions of warmongering critics. Listen to fans not critics who just want to destroy everything These producers, director & scriptwriter are totally out of touch with the audience. You don't kill off your star character & expect people to rush to the theaters. You have to be a moron like child mentality George Lucas to kill off your biggest star like Harrison Ford (Hans Solo) and now Caesar. It's like expecting the audience to accept Camilla in place of Diana. Get real. Who are they kidding? There is no audience of any notable worth who appreciates the killing of the top star. These producers & directors have to be plain stupid & not qualified to make any film if they think killing their star is a good idea. If they plan on a 4th movie, they had better bring Caesar back & let the audiences know it before it is released. We need to see Apes & humans coexisting without wars.This is why the second film of Allegiant was never made. Just because fans bought the 3rd book doesn't mean they approved of killing off Tris. This is why the 3rd movie did so poorly. Everyone assumed the film would kill Tris off like the book. The audience boycotts these movies which kill their star. Or damages a supercouple. This is why no one wanted a 4th Divergent film which killed off their star like the book. Learn from the mistakes of others.Another issue with Apes films are the constant battles. We are sick & tired of wars & battles, even if that is the name of the film. We want to see character interaction, relationships, building a new society. Progress, Ape cities, no killing, progress in interacting with mute humans. Developing a new Ape government. No more warring humans.So bring back Caesar. Nurse him back to health & have him lead the apes in building cities, government, educating their young, society, learning & becoming more advanced in skills without any more wars.Call it Planet of the Apes; The New world Order or New Frontier.",War for the Planet of the Apes
235,drael64,"Raw, real",10,22 July 2017,"In an age where everything human is neutered through the lense of political correctness, the apes series represents a bold, primal honesty, where neither humans nor apes are good nor bad and everything is on display, and not hidden in pretence. Its an exploration of morality, and the war between that and the primal emotions of hate, sadness, and fear that broil inside us, brilliantly brought to life by the animal-human hybrid of emotions acted through our protagonists the apes. In this movie we follow caeser and his tribe, in a quest for revenge, rescue and to avoid a war.This plot is not specifically about ""a war"", but rather a battle in the context of a greater war - so while there is action, like the other ape movies there is a lot more going on than just boringly consistent bang, boom, woosh. In particular there are dramatic moments, that speak to the human condition, and the inner battles we face in life.This movie brings a very welcome touch of comic relief which lightens the mood to the series, and also a little innocent love and hope - so you won't walk away feeling jaded either. Moving, exciting, and brilliantly executed.",War for the Planet of the Apes
236,Oberrated,Production is what saves this film.,8,17 July 2017,"How beautifully well done this film was is what saves the film from being rated any lower and also what feels like the right ending to such an immaculate story does a good bit of saving as well. But certain plot points within the film just are far too glaring for me to excuse them and praise this film as so many people have been doing. Again, this is a fine finishing touch on the trilogy, I just felt it could have been done way better and without such reckless unexcused moments and actions. Production wise: It is simply gorgeous and well made. Structure wise: far too scattered with questionable motives and actions. Overall, the ""meh"" of the trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes
237,eparazak,"A thrilling, dark, brutal, epic conclusion to the Planet of the Apes reboot franchise",10,16 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is the latest installment to the rebooted Planet of the Apes franchise. It takes place about five years after Dawn. Caesar is now leading the ape tribe to war against the U.S. army up north. After an accident in his tribe, he, alongside some of his closest friends like Maurice and Rocket go on a journey to avenge said tribe. Along the way, they run into a young girl as well as an ape who would help them out on their journey.Let me just start right off the bat by saying that if you went into this movie expecting one big fight throughout the entire thing, then you'd come out disappointed. That's not how I expected the movie to be like. I expected it to be more sophisticated and interesting than just being a pure war film. Just like the previous installments in the franchise, the movie manages to rely more on characters and themes rather than pure action and I think it was handled incredibly.One of my favorite things about this movie has to be how the narrative is told. For the majority of the film, Caesar is the main focus. He's given the most amount of screen time, we see into his thoughts. The movie doesn't often cut to human characters unless Caesar appears on screen. Essentially, this is his story through his perspective. As such, the dialogue is fairly limited. As such, we learn more about how a character feels through their expressions and thoughts rather than through words. Granted, there are some exceptions of this such as when the humans would speak, but we don't necessarily get that much time with them, contrary to what you may think.In the older installments, I didn't necessarily care for some of the other apes such as Maurice. I only found them to be side characters, and admittedly, some of them do stick around as side characters. In this case, it feels like the ape tribe that was established has grown into a family that I have grown to feel for. Believe me, the movie gets emotional at many points. For example, I like Maurice now more than ever now and it's not just because of the inclusion of Nova.Like Rise and Dawn, the acting was very well done with both apes and humans. The motion capture makes the apes look like they're real apes. If the motion capture technology is put to good use like with what the people did here, the creatures made using said technology can look fantastic. I'd call this one of the best examples of how motion capture can be done correctly, even if it's a continually developing technology.If there's one thing the movie could've done without, it would have to be a comic relief. Bad Ape is introduced midway into the movie and acts as the movie's comical character. To me, this wasn't necessary as it breaks the more serious mood of the movie on multiple occasions. Either way, I didn't think he was too distracting for the most part and I did laugh at his comical moments.If you're expecting a pure war film, you'll walk out of the theater disappointed. War for the Planet of the Apes is one of the summer's best movies to date with its engaging story, well-developed characters and harsh themes.10/10",War for the Planet of the Apes

This last episode is really a heartbreaker and emotional.!!! I do not understand why or how anyone could rate this as a 1/10??? Are you watching the same Movie? Please, you must have blinkers on..
Caesar is a credit to society and more human as an ape, than the humans are themselves. I Recommend you watch for yourself 👌

239,seige-hound,"Great acting and cinematography, questionable story beats.",8,29 July 2017,"So, War for the Planet of the Apes is a pretty bad title for this movie. Yes, technically there is a war going on, but unlike the other two films, it is not that action packed at all. In reality, this film is a sort-of checklist designed to set up the transition into the 'original' Planet of the Apes story. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, mainly due to the beautiful cinematography and effects, and Andy Serkis' performance is great as always. But a part of me is definitely underwhelmed by this film. For a film called War for the Planet of the Apes, this is the slower, more somber story compared to the last two.So, the main story beat, and the motivation for the Colonel, the primary antagonist played by Woody Harrelson, is that the virus that drove humanity to near extinction (and made the apes smarter) in Rise, has mutated, developing more symptoms in the carriers, the main one being that those infected with the new strain of the disease are no longer able to talk, devolving into primitive, ape- like grunts. The Colonel sees this as a sign that humans are losing their humanity and resorts to desperate despotic measures in order to ensure the survival of the human race. He thinks that wiping out the apes once and for all is the only chance of human survival, or at least humans as they currently are.This film also introduces Nova, a human girl who is orphaned when Caesar kills her father in self-defense (although she doesn't show any sign of resentment for that for some reason). It's implied that she's going to be the ancestor of the primitive humans in the original Planet of the Apes story that are pre-lingual and subservient to the apes, although if they end up remaking the original story they might tell it differently. She is mute, due to the aforementioned disease, but is shown to have a deep emotional connection to the apes that adopted her, and is able to converse with the apes via sign language, that she picks up very quickly.You see, there are quite a few plot contrivances in this story, and it seems there was quite a bit of content cut from the story in order to make the run time reasonable. I can't say that for sure, but there's parts of the story that seem pretty rushed, like when the gorilla puts a flower in Nova's hair, dies in the next scene, and Nova cries like they knew each other for a lot longer than they did, but maybe I'm just looking too deeply into it.Overall, I think this is a (mostly) great ending to a great series, ending with a well deserved and bittersweet ending that ties up Caesar's arc very well. I hope the series continues, maybe with a remake of Planet of the Apes, but we'll wait and see what happens. It's not a bad movie by any means, and those 1/10s can go die in a fire.",War for the Planet of the Apes
240,ElliesWonder,Give him a lunch box!,9,14 July 2017,"Purchased the presale tickets on July 13th because I couldn't wait to see how human would be defeated again by Caesar.I was a fan of the planet of apes since I was very little, my first planet of apes series was the 2001 version. It was a very shocking story to me in that age. When I told my school friends that human became slaves of monkeys, everyone thought I made up the story. (The movie probably not popular in my age group back in the time, so my little friends didn't know this fantasy setting eventually created in 1968, 2 years before human were capable to spend Spaceship Apollo to the moon in 1969, Americans already filmed the planet of apes in 1967, a sci-fi started with spaceship driving and time traveling, slaving human and experimenting human body. That 1st one looks so terrible dark.)Back to this movie, enter War of the Planet of the Apes, I was expected to see a World War III before I went into the theater. Big fight, explosion, friendship and betrayal, I was excepted to watch all these excitements, however, the movie started pretty quietly. The first 20 minutes was slow-moving. But it turned better afterwards.More than 2 hours, Caesar been fully bully in the whole movie, and lastly, the screenwriter wrote him dead. The actor been beaten for a complete full scene and gave him a lunch box at last! What a humanity? How could the screenwriter against the rule that hero never dies? (A joke about The lunch box - minor roles; especially the dead bodies in war screen often get low pay or no pay a day, but the crew will provide them a lunchbox. So many costars like to act dead body and get a free lunch box.)By the way, there are only a few battles happened between apes and human, human destroyed themselves by their humanity.
About the new ape world:
Does ape really better than human? No, I don't think so, it probably just another Animal Farm*.Anyway, War of the Planet of Apes desired the title to be the best movie of this summer 2017.

Yes it's a movie, yes it's a war but I felt it was over the top and unnecessary. I don't enjoy watching characters I love being slaughtered.

242,shivamt25,Spectacular finale to a fantastic series!,8,14 July 2017,"War for the planet of the ApesNever have I ever thought that I will be this happy to see my own kind getting defeated by a bunch of apes. I even thought that apes should win, as their no point in being the most intelligent species of the planet without a spec of humanity left in us. When we loose humanity, we loose hope, we loose trust and we start fighting each other. But apes, no.... Apes together, apes strong!This movie is dark to its core, brutal as wars are but at the same time emotional enough that you may have to hold your tears at some points. There is enough story to make you empathise with the apes and angry at humans. I expected the third installment to be grand, and it was better than that. Heart touching dialogues - check Emotional close up scenes - check Spectacular slow motion action - check Background music so perfect it fits in every scene - hell, yeah!It had everything I wanted to see in a movie like this. You may not like it as much as I did but you will sure want more movies in the series after watching it. I know I want to see more, but at the same time I don't want this series' name to get diluted. I hope if they do come up with a sequel or prequel of spin off, they manage to create the magic again as they did this time.I give it 8.5/10.",War for the Planet of the Apes
243,TheMovonka,"Misleading title, but intense end of an epic journey",8,4 August 2017,"To start short and simple, yes the ""War of the Planet of the Apes"" shows no war at all. The misleading title, trailer and even posters let expectations arise to see the conflict of the second movie intensify and peak in an enduring battle between last human armies and the settled ape fighters to establish their colony for good. Well, you don't get thatAccording to this aspect, I understand a lot of disappointment in the critics, but let me tell you, audience trades in that expectation with an intense emotional experience about the desperate fight for survival of the apes, led by their liberator from hour one, Caesar. This is why in Austria and Germany, this movie is called ""Planet of the Apes: Survival"" and suits much better.You feel with the always on the run colony of apes, as Woody Harrelson hunts down the enemy race of wild animals in his perception in a classically established psychopath Apocalypse Now manner as the Colonel of a separatist human army. As he drifts away to madness, long and slow pacing scenes as well as high class CGI close ups bound viewers with the fear of the chased ones. As the brutality narrows down to single destinies of ape characters, fear changes to will for vengeance and the guerrilla fight for a better future of apes begins.Here the movie establishes the pace and structure of how should inferior technology beat the crazy humans with all their military power. Consequently, as war is brutal, there is no Rambo story to see the good fighting the bad, but a story taking you deeper and deeper into the desperation of being chased and jailed. Suddenly Caesar and his tribe find themselves captured and enslaved in a concentration camp, mixing the movie temporary with Schindlers List and Unbroken moments. But as apes are strong together, the fight for survival continues for a better future, for which Caesar would sacrifice everything, even his principles.But let's be honest, there are obvious issues with the plot. From the very slow speed to allow strong bindings with ape characters and a good side of the human race, embodied by a lost lonely girl who shows a solid performance to enrich empathy, the movie takes a long road until the big dramatic final. Slow motion and long dialogues dominate over swift fight scenes like in part two. As this is subjective to like it or not, still some problem occur in the script. Entering a front door, when you follow as guerrilla troop is linked to high risk of loss. Even without military education the apes could know better how to avoid being seen. On the other hand, entering a concentration camp, leaving it or hundreds of apes disappearing out of a cage is not recognized by any guard who should be trained? I don't think so And yes, the final has its peak as a second human army is just deleted by a coincidentally useful avalanche. That was an easy script move to shorten the end in favor of the apes. But well, to be honest, history is written with such coincidence, and even if it looks ridiculous, would anybody have thought the Spanish armada is beaten by British thanks to storms and winds or did anybody complain about that in Dunkirk the German troops stopped to march on? Still it happened like that, so you just can accept the ""history of the planet of the apes"" by the creators of that movie even if there would have been more elegant ways of pursue that development of the story.Fighting against those harsh critics, giving 1 out of 10 stars, just because of the stated issue points is absolutely absurd. Still the movie is well paced, breathtakingly executed and well-acted. Not meeting the strong expectations of certain viewers does not make it a bad movie I would say. But please go and decide for yourself. You are now well prepared to enjoy or avoid the big final of the Planet of the Apes Trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes
244,trevor-82944,I'm Loving This Monkey Business!,7,14 July 2017,"Are apes really better than people? Ever since the groundbreaking science-fiction novel was written by French author Pierre Boulle, we have questioned whether evolution will come to bite back at our dysfunctional political structure. Apes have yet to outsmart us idiotic humans, but now the last addition to the widely-praised reboot makes our future clearer.War for the Planet of the Apes first gives us a recap of the last two films, explaining the RISE and the DAWN that led us to the WAR between apes and humans. Like most summer movies, CGI composes basically every single frame here. Although comparatively speaking, each ape design is distinctly detailed to move in the proper ape mannerism. From a distance, the apes look more like they belong in the PS4; up close, the light hits their skin perfectly: you could almost reach out to wipe the orangutan's tears.Many cast members here have returned from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes; while computers cloak their entire figure, the power in their eyes remain untouched to communicate true sincere pain. They speak either one word at a time or using American Sign Language, greeting one another with pressed foreheads rather than a familiar hug. The little actions they make will make you wonder how you could understand so much about another species apart from your own.The rebellious species' familiar leader, Caesar, continues being the most powerful asset of the franchise thanks to the stern performance by Andy Serkis. Now, Caesar can speak in mostly complete sentences, further motivating his fear for his own followers. However, his motivation to fight as revenge for the death of his family comes off rather weak; we've seen the scenario countless times before to much greater effect. Aside from Caesar, plenty of other complex characters hold the story up on its two-pawed feet, even if some key roles feel more underused than the smaller roles. One of the smaller characters who gets a little more screen-time than he deserves is one of the few speaking apes, ""Bad Ape,"" terrifically played by Steve Zahn as he moves us one minute and cracks us up the next; the tension he adds grounds us into reality. Yet he also leans too much upon comic relief and too little upon being an actual character in a war movie. Think K-2SO in Rogue One, except a bit more useful.As a war movie, director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) compromises the real brutality of a holocaust concentration camp for a suitable PG-13 rating. The true horrific moments come out from the details: several ape traitors join the humans as they rally up the other apes into cages to starve, the words ""Ape- pocalypse Now"" deface the underground chambers, an X-shaped torture device reminiscing crucifixion taunts the apes daily—it all lands on Caesar as he takes a whipping by his own kind just because he stood up for the apes' rights.Unfortunately, no perfection exists in this interpretation of a potential future, as it is ruled under a stereotypically evil ruler who likes to monologue about his past. It also makes no sense why the end of mankind would only affect the US. Considering these ape species originated from Africa and Southeast Asia, adding those governments into the scheme would have added some realism to a potential WWIII.But one new character does bring out the deepest hope for humanity despite our inability to communicate. We get to meet Nova as a child, unable to speak, and brought alongside Caesar's colleagues. Her introduction alone mesmerizes you: After breaking into a human's home, one of these apes, the orangutan, notices Nova asleep in her bed. He returns her doll to her, slowly, keeping a curious gaze upon her gentle nature. Their silent eye-to-eye exchange brings the needed tension breaker during the endless line of heat. Her spectacular moments do not stop there, as she sees beauty in the harsh tribulation blind to her new ape friends. She looks past the snow to glance at the beauty of pink blossoms in the tree above. More characters like her need to be made for the screen, as someone so young of so few words can teach us grown men more than we realize about reconsidering our actions.So in conclusion, War for the Planet of the Apes gives the Planet of the Apes franchise what it needed all along. It unrighteously continues to be detrimental to the humanity we can produce, yet still gives a satisfactory exploration of the value in communication much like what Arrival masterfully explored. Even if we already know how this movie will end, the impact of what so far is the best movie of the summer stands clear. You will be shocked from how much in common you share with these nonhumans fighting against ourselves, just further proof why apes are the most beautiful creatures in the animal kingdom.",War for the Planet of the Apes
245,dissident320,Emotionally satisfying story,8,16 August 2017,"I re-watched the previous 2 movies in the series recently just so I could gauge them against this film. While I think the second one has a stronger story, this one hits harder with the emotional side of things.I think the movie does a great job of not portraying things as black and white. While the humans are seen as villains to the apes, they're ultimately just fighting for self-preservation. I think in giving Woody's character a back story that allows you to see what he's been through is much more interesting than making him a moustache twirling bad guy.Some really fantastic performances from Andy Serkis and Woody Harrelson. But the one that really surprised me was Steve Zahn as 'Bad Ape'. He's curious and funny but brings this sadness to the character that really impressed me.The story for the most part works. The plot gets a little messy towards the final act but it was still paced quite well. It had a surprising amount of restraint in the action than expected for a 3rd installment in a franchise. By the end I felt okay if this was the final movie in this series. They made 3 very good but very different movies.

246,hiraishinnojutsu,The horror..... and the moral issue of the ape-pocalypse now,8,25 July 2017,"If any of you have watched Charlton Heston's ""The Ten Commandments"", or in love with Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"", you may find this movie pretty familiar. Well, how could you not? those two masterpieces are among many classical movies that inspired Matt Reeves' ""War for the Planet of the Apes"". So, how well did Matt Reeves imbibe the elements from those movies into his? All I can say is : Pretty good! The horrors of war, the last desperate act of humanity against nature, the moral standpoint of the apes (that humanity in this movie once have), the importance of family, the struggle of both leaders of their respective race against themselves are among the themes that build up this movie. At first you have your sympathy with Caesar, leader of the oppressed race who just want to live peacefully in the woods with his wife, children, and fellow apes, far from the grasp of humanity, the oppressors. as the story goes by, it is revealed that the human soldiers have their own reasons on killing the apes. At this point, viewers' sympathy will go with everyone in the story: the apes and the humans, as each of us will understand that the world doesn't just get split into black and white. Each of us has a good and evil, black and white, angel and demon, human and beast duality in our hearts. It is evident that as the story goes by, what is supposed to be the beasts are behaving more and more like what is supposed to be humans, while what is supposed to be the humans are behaving more and more like what is supposed to be the beast. this inverted status is what the colonel describe in this movie as ""Nature's punishment against humanity for their arrogance"". It's not wrong if I say this movie is the amalgamation and the conclusion of the previous two, as it combines the dramatization of RISE and the action sequence of DAWN, WAR doesn't fail the previous two, in fact, it finishes what is begin with RISE and what is continued with DAWN : An epic and wonderful trilogy of the journey to planet of the apes.",War for the Planet of the Apes
247,OlieRendch,"Incredible film-making, directing and acting but an unoriginal and inconsequential plot.",7,24 July 2017,"Well, here we are, a conclusion of sorts. I absolutely loved Rise of the Planet of the Apes; it's a film unlike anything I had seen before. Dawn was one of the most intense, edge-of-your-seat experiences I'd ever had in a cinema, and now is the third part of Ceaser's personal trilogy. How did it go?I'll start off by just saying how much the apes look like actual real animals. Seriously, the CGI improves with every film. There are moments where if you told me that was an advanced animatronic head on screen, I would believe you. There's one particular shot of Maurice the orangutan where I swear it was like watching a close-up in an Attenborough documentary, they are that real. So that in itself blows me away. Of course, along with the expert VFX team, you have Andy Serkis and others doing their performance-capture work as the apes; the emotion and acting they manage to portray is incredible and a thrill to watch.Moving onto the story now, I have to say, the plot is what lets it down for me. For a film that contains the phrase ""War for the Planet"", the story is a very contained and inconsequential narrative that has no real bearing on the world as a whole. Sure, it has major points in Ceaser's life and the life of his tribe and what they have to face, and as a story there, it was a suspenseful, brutal, incredibly well- scored and acted film. But in terms of what I feel I had been led to expect, it dropped the ball for me. If I accept what the film is about though, and look directly at the what the plot was, even then, although it's not a bad film, it's completely unoriginal. What transpires from the second act onwards is everything we've seen before in films where a group of characters must escape somewhere; it hits all the beats of that genre and the only change it offers is the fact that it's with apes; which, to be fair, is a fascinating visual and I will never grow tired of seeing how the apes are depicted in this franchise but because Rise and Dawn were so different from anything I'd seen before I was not expecting this film to be so familiar.I mean there are more aspects about this film I liked a lot, including Steve Zahn's character, some of the little easter-eggs and callbacks to the 1968 film and Michael Giacchino's score, which were all great, and I'm not saying this is a bad film, it's just very unoriginal and falls into some clichés every now and again.In the end, War For the Planet of the Apes is an incredible step- up in film-making itself with the directing, acting and what VFX is capable of but for me personally the story was a let-down and I very much hope there is a next entry after this as I feel there is more to tell.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I supposed that's natural. Funny, how the one reviewer said he was a coward for not leaving the theater halfway through and weeps for cinema. I get that. Another said the new SpiderMan was trash and can't understand people liking Spiderman and disliking this show. For me, each was junky bunky but for different reasons. The writing and plot were bad but this Planet of the Apes is just old and poor stuff. The first one was enough. Trying to anthropomorphize apes and God and anything else we can think of gets old. Being talked down to by Hollywood gets old with their main purpose, still, money. One monkey has 'stunted jabber' like Hollywood put in the mouths of early cowboy Indian movies, the Zoo Monkey. And, Ceasar is an articulate son of a gun who can communicate with words to all other lesser types who know sign language. Somehow, those not knowing how to speak with voice understand 'voice'. They all utter and it's all utter nonsense. Wishful thinking and humans grappling for some delusional empathy bounces all through the film. There's a phony short of the mark 'empathy' which the movie makers try to be getting at. I saw a little film called 'DOG'S PURPOSE' which was so superior to this film while delivering such a more powerful , empathetic and real interpretation of the whole human vs animal trip. The one ape wondering why pictures were so small when looking through the binoculars was an attempt at humor but was just stupid. That , alone , ought to get one to walk out of a theater. To each their own. I think children, little kids could get something from this flick but just a turn off for me at 74.I wonder if i went out on a date with someone and i hated this show and they loved it would we have much in common? I don't know. Sensibilities are so complex and i don't think reactions and sympathies can be easily measured. I don't understand how anyone can really like this junk with the same vigor someone who loves this show can't understand why i think it's monkey junk. So be it. We can find common ground elsewhere get differing things out of different things. This movie didn't do a thing for me no feeling, no humor nothing interesting going on. The only guy i much like is the dude who was shot dead when he said he was going to put the wood down. Some guy wants to surrender and Caesar shoots him dead.

250,johnplocar,Best of the recent 'Apes' series,9,3 January 2018,"I'm a pretty big fan of the ""Planet of the Apes"" films. I love the first one, my favorite is ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes"", and the recent reboot series comes along and I've been trying to love them as much as everyone else does, but I can't seem to bring myself there. I liked ""Rise"" just fine. It has a decent character driven story with a likable main cast, but suffers from pretty poor looking special effects and blatantly abuses CGI; while also having some pretty standout bad moments shoved in at inappropriate times. Overall a fine film. Then ""Dawn"" comes along and it improves in some aspects, but takes some major missteps in others. It is a fantastically made film, the character of Caesar and most of the apes are phenomenally well done, the effects were great and the story was very solid. Problems mainly resided 100% in all of the human characters whether they were hollow 2-dimensional shells with no personality nor charisma whatsoever or they were complete idiots only there to further the plot with their stupidity which was annoying and not believable in the slightest. Again, overall a fine film. Now ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" comes in and holy moly this is a great movie. Legitimately a great film. It is everything I have wanted out of this reboot series and more. It's dark, one of the bleakest films to come out of 2017 for sure but also has plenty of levity to it as well. It has humanity and personality and style throughout its entirety. All of the characters are interesting and 3-dimensional beings. The villain, played by Woody Harrelson, is terrifying and Andy Serkis as Ceasar is beyond a shadow of a doubt one of the greatest heroes ever portrayed on the big screen. Ceasar's character arc is one of best I've seen in a movie series and it comes to a true glorious end here.The cinematography is gorgeous with its feel of an old school epic, the story is enthralling and beautifully poetic, tonally pitch perfect, and the action as well as every plot point feels monumental.

251,ryanskywalker-87402,Apes together strong,8,23 July 2017,"Back in 2011, Rise of the Planet of the Apes introduced us to Caesar, the genetically enhanced & super-intelligent chimp who would go on to lead an ape uprising. It was a fresh & smartly handled reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise that not only began the saga on a promising note but was also one of the finest films of its year.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes followed three years later, and was such an ambitious & tactically crafted sequel that it left everyone astonished with its darker premise & post-apocalyptic setting. The story further developed Caesar's arc and all was about him rising to the challenge of being a great leader in the gravest of circumstances.And now we have War for the Planet of the Apes that made its way into cinemas as the final piece of the saga that finds Caesar wrestling with his darker instincts right in the middle of a deadly conflict he never wanted to be a part of. Everything that happened in previous two films has led to this, but it's also where Caesar becomes a legend of mythic proportions.The story of War for the Planet of the Apes finds Caesar & his tribe forced into an all-out war with an army of humans, led by a ruthless Colonel. As the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar goes on a quest to avenge his kind along with his most trusted companions which eventually leads to an epic battle that will determine the fate of the two species & the future of the planet.Co-written & directed by Matt Reeves, the film opens with a brief but thrilling battle between apes & humans that takes an instant hold of the viewers' attention and maintains a firm grip on it till the end. The story is bleak & poignant but also riveting & intimate, for the stakes are higher this time & Caesar is tested like never before. However, it still feels a bit stretched in the middle, engaging but slower than it needs to be.The script packs a gripping premise that not only continues Caesar's journey but also adds more depth & dimensions to his arc, for we find Caesar not only driven by a personal vendetta but also haunted by nightmares of what he might become in his quest for revenge. Retribution, survival, sacrifice, slavery, leadership & redemption are few of the themes that the film explores, and does so in a patient yet effective manner.The post-apocalyptic setting exhibits a similarity to Dawn, and the expertly chosen locations only add to its harsh surrounding. The static manoeuvring of camera, apt use of slow-mo technique & fine application of cold colour palette not only enhances the drama but also intensifies its wintry ambiance. VFX is top-notch as expected from Weta Digital, pacing is an issue in the middle, while its stimulating score is always in sync from start to finish.Coming to the performances, Andy Serkis, in his third outing as Caesar, delivers a truly knockout performance that's as impeccable as it is soulful, plus his screen presence is both dominating & infectious. Karin Konoval & Terry Notary play Maurice & Rocket respectively and make fine use of their additional screen time. As for the humans, only Woody Harrelson leaves his mark in the role of the Colonel while Amiah Miller serves as a mute observer of the carnage.On an overall scale, War for the Planet of the Apes is an impressive entry in the rebooted Planet of the Apes series, and along with the previous two films makes up for one of contemporary cinema's finest trilogies. A strong, epic & emphatic end to a saga that began six years ago, it's a moving, meditative & morally complex blockbuster that lives up to its enormous hype, and also cements its status, and that of its trilogy, as one of the most powerful sagas to unfold on the silver screen.",War for the Planet of the Apes
252,taryllsbaker,"""An engrossing conclusion to the trilogy.""",8,18 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is directed by Matt Reeves and stars Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson, Karin Konoval, Steve Zahn, Terry Notary, Ty Olson, Toby Kebbell and introducing Amiah Miller.After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind. (12A cert; 140 mins)There was a Rise, there was a Dawn, now there's a War. Through each instalment of this rebooted franchise we have seen the mastery of visual effects taken to new heights. 'Rise' began the story of Caesar (Andy Serkis) with an incredible response. 'Dawn' took everything that was great and expanded upon it, both in story and in visuals. 'War' continues that leap in modern filmmaking – with Matt Reeves returning to direct – and doesn't lose what made the previous films so remarkable; the characters.What makes War for the Planet of the Apes so special, along with its predecessor, is how Reeves shows us two sides to the story. Sure, we root for the apes, but in this film we feel a sense of guilt and sadness for the humans (sometimes). The battle isn't just depicted in the film, it's in your mind. As I watch, I'm conflicted. I find myself wanting someone to call surrender, but of course this won't happen. There will be chaos. There will be death. 'War' shows it all; the riveting opening sequence prepares you for what's to come, and does so stunningly.Andy Serkis has made quite a name for himself in recent years. His role as Gollum in LOTR was of course a staple in his career, but I truly believe this franchise put him in the spotlight for many. There's no doubt he's a talented actor. He brings all the intricacies of feelings and emotion into his performance, with motion capture providing a phenomenal effect. His eyes show heartbreak, rage, love. He connects to the viewer, just as the viewer connects to him. 'War' continues his winning streak, he's truly wonderful in this film.Woody Harrelson plays the leader of the human army. He's evil, but as the film explores his reasoning, we become sympathetic. This is the stem of those conflicting thoughts, and something I love about Reeves' writing. Harrelson performs alongside Serkis very well, every scene is filled with tension, their rivalry is enthralling to watch. There's been a lot of great talent chosen for this franchise, and Harrelson is definitely one of the strongest.Surrounding the two relatable leads are a cast of superb characters, ranging from Rocket (Terry Notary), to the sweet Maurice (Karin Konoval) and the kooky but fun Bad Ape (Steve Zahn). The film also introduces Nova (Amiah Miller), a young girl saved and protected by the apes. Miller is a surprising addition to the cast and turns in a delightful performance.As I mentioned, this film is visually stunning. Michael Seresin returns as cinematographer, shooting on 65mm film, capturing every scene with impeccable skill. Each shot is carefully constructed, and the sets look beautiful. The motion capture is groundbreaking, the performances are expertly implemented into the apes and the result is seamless. The same applies to the visual and special effects; which have both developed significantly since the last instalment. A large amount of the environment is created with CGI, but it's well established and fabricated enough to be wholly convincing. The sound design also has a hand in how realistic the world is, and it's outstanding.Michael Giacchino returns to the Apes franchise with a score that evolves from his previous material, amplifying his use of percussion and woodwinds, embellishing his unique style. The opening cue is a suspenseful rise of apprehension and the reoccurring motifs perform well aside the visuals throughout. It's a terrifying, huge and atmospherical score, but there are moments of true beauty as well.'War' is an impressive film and highly entertaining. But in retrospect, I still find 'Dawn' to be the superior picture. People will expect a different kind of war, admittedly I did too, however that's not necessarily the reason I felt underwhelmed. 'War' needed some trimming; it's not butt-achingly long, but there were moments where the pacing felt a little monotonous. 'Dawn' had an equal share of action and storytelling, which made the picture a lot tighter as a whole. But 'War' is still a ride of emotions. Andy Serkis is the highlight amongst many highlights.Verdict; War for the Planet of the Apes is an engrossing, visually impressive picture and a fitting end to the Apes trilogy.War for the Planet of the Apes – ★★★★ (8/10)",War for the Planet of the Apes

The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie forces the viewer to pay attention to the screen. However, I feel like there wasn't enough story being told for the movie to truly captivate me. The movie follows the beat of the drum while still managing to be entertaining. I liked it, but it could've been a tad bit better. They should've added more emotional character depth to this story.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEexsngv5A",War for the Planet of the Apes
254,Abranth-d,Apes together !,10,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of war for the planet of the apes . So once again Andy Serkis is back as Ceasar and he nails the role . The story is set right where Dawn left off , and despite being a very slow plotline , it still manages to keep you hooked. There is a lot of emotional scenes in this movie and Caesar faces too much tragedy like never before , but a better music score would've given a drive to the emotional scenes. The action scenes had less screen time than the prequels , but had , better CGI and choreography. Woody Harrelson was great as the bad guy , and his arguement with Caesar raises a lot of philosophical questions. The best thing about this movie is that it makes you root for the apes even though you're Human. In the end , "" war "" is an ape-tastic movie with ape-tacular action , great characters , a very slow plotline and a perfect end to a perfect trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes
255,amichnea,Where is the WAR? More like snoozefest of the Apes:(,1,14 October 2017,"I loved the first two films, Rise and Dawn, however this film had no story whatsoever. Why is it called War for the Planet of the Apes? The first film had a lot more action than this one, the second one had 100 times more action than this one.Pretty insulting that it took them three years to follow Dawn and they gave us absolutely nothing. Just a very basic extension of the Dawn which could have been summed up in about 30 minutes max.I was falling asleep, my wife fell asleep half way, I did not see the need to give her a bump so she wakes up as there was nothing to see. At the end I almost jumped up and though wait, this is going to be good, there is an army of Monkeys coming down fighting for supremacy, this will make complete sense for the next film... (almost felt like the whole non existent plot and BS was worth the 2 hours wait)... but I guess it was just me falling asleep trying to make the film more exciting. No Ape army, no Ape action, no Ape of anything... plenty of Ape Drama though.I could sum up this whole film in 2 3 words but can't give any spoilers.Sure the Ape CGI is amazing as are the emotions from the Apes, Bad Ape was great but everything else was a huge MEH. They should have just called it ""Drama of the Planet of the Apes"", or ""What happens to monkeys whilst war breaks out around them"", you could easily see that on the History Channel or even today in different parts of the world.I was expecting so much more, considering the first and second films. What a huge disappointment.The film is beautiful, don't get me wrong... for Drama students, an Oscar nomination or something you would expect at a films festival where it would get 100 different awards but none for the story. At this rate we are going to see another 5 or 10 films before we get to the Ape society which the originals were showing.In the first and second films I actually did not know who I would sympathise with.I guess we could go via this route: Humans Very Bad, Apes Good, Humans Bad, Apes Good, Apes Bad, Humans mostly Good, Apes Good, Human Very Bad, Apes Very Good, Human Very Very Bad, Apes still Good. Going forward we will need: Apes Good, Humans Good, Apes Bad, Humans Good, Apes Very Very Bad, Humans Very Very Good, Apes Good and Humans Good everyone happy.",War for the Planet of the Apes
256,FabledGentleman,By far the best planet of the apes movie,9,14 July 2017,"This movie is a display of fantastic visuals, powerful performances, great directing and a story with a lot of emotion. This is easily one of the best films i have seen all year.The two previous films in the trilogy, rise and dawn, are both good films, but this film is nothing short of great. It delivers on so many levels, and the performance by Andy Serkis is absolutely spectacular. Why this man has not won an Oscar or Golden Globe yet for his portrayals as Caesar, King Kong or Gollum is beyond me, i can't believe he hasn't even been nominated for any of these roles, the man is a genius. Hopefully this will change this time, because this performance cannot and must not be overlooked.There isn't much to criticize about this film, it does almost everything correctly. And they could easily have gone overboard on so many aspects of this film. Bad Ape for example, which simply could have become this franchise answer to Jar Jar Binks, but fortunately he just adds some comic relief at the right moments, which helps to relive some pressure in this dark and sad film.War for the planet of the apes is a lot more emotional than the other two movies, and it follows the story from the previous film, where Koba's actions now have triggered the remaining humans, which are now lead by a strong leader, the colonel. His mission is to end the apes once and for all, and he has some serious firepower at his disposal. But we all knew where this trilogy was going, we all know who is winning in the end, the question is only, how.Woody Harrelson does a great job portraying the colonel, he is not a flat one dimensional character, but he has his own reasons for his actions, He have plenty of time to explain the cause of his actions and motivations. The scenes he shares with Caesar is absolutely fantastic, and I'm at times forgetting the fact that the apes are CGI. I mean, seriously, this is masterclass in CGI, some of the best i have ever seen.I also saw this film in 3D, and the 3D is also fantastic. It is not overdone anywhere, it is relaxing on your eyes, the 3D is only there to create the depth and to add to the story and the cinematography. Which is a bit rare this days, most films go way overboard on the 3D, because Hollywood seem to have forgotten how it should be, or maybe they never knew. But this film does it right, so don't hesitate to see it in 3D.Speaking of Cinematography. Lovely imagery, great nature backdrops, great use of lights. It felt like i was outside in the wild with the apes, wonderfully shot film. Especially the forest scenes.There is only a few things that bothered me about the film, but i can't mention much of it, as it's related to the story, and i don't want to spoil anything, but i kind of find it weird none of these apes have genitalia. Not really a big deal, but you know. Weird.And i must not forget to mention 12 year old Amiah Miller which plays the young girl. She also does a phenomenal job, as a character that basically does not speak a line in the entire film, she expresses her feelings through body language and the use of her eyes, which are some very pretty eyes, i have to say. And i am reminded how many young talents we are seeing these days. Dafne Keen from Logan is another example.Matt Reeves did it right this time, he really did. He orchestrated a film which is almost pure CGI, and we almost forget that it actually is. He manages to compose a more serious film, with lot of emotion and heart, but still manages to have some comic relief without destroying the underlying dark tone. And he just brings out the best of all the actors and all the rest of the crew, it is simply a great piece of film he has created. Now i believe ""The Batman"" is in safe hands.I highly recommend this film, go see it. And be prepared to shed some tears, the story is powerful, and very sad.9/10 - Great",War for the Planet of the Apes
257,Chiller7,If ape holocaust movies are your kind of thing,8,30 November 2017,"Here's a movie that I'll give a high rating because it's technically well made, but I can't actually say it's my kind of movie. I like having a good time watching movies. I liked the previous two movies in this franchise. This one though, War for the Planet of the Apes, was more of a depressing experience. It's a dreary story full of cruel people (& apes) doing horrible things to each other and treating each other badly. It's the ape version of a concentration camp/holocaust movie, for those of you into that kind of thing. It's not for me, but that's just my taste, so I won't fault the movie for that.Where I can fairly subtract a couple of points from my rating would be some of the dumb decisions and illogical behavior made by some of the people made throughout the movie. Both humans and apes keep making bad decisions that get their own sides in trouble. For instance, we see here, once again, the dumb prison guard trope. Somehow, the one guy tasked with guarding a jail in movies always has to conveniently be the dumbest guy on Earth. It's frustrating to watch characters being that stupid and comes off as lazy writing.Don't get me wrong; the movie's not all bad. Excellent CGI, for instance. The quality of digital trickery has reached such levels that it's hard to even accept that those aren't real apes on screen. It's pretty impressive.",War for the Planet of the Apes

260,botrytis,Refreshing trilogy which also adds to the old series,9,14 July 2017,"First of all: People who are claiming that this movie is an anti- Trump propaganda: ""Principal photography on the film began on October 14, 2015, in the Lower Mainland in Vancouver, under the working title Hidden Fortress. Filming was expected to take place there until early March 2016"" The first 20 minutes of the movie is a top-notch action/drama packed extravaganza with perfect war tone and beautiful cinematography which overall perfectly continues the tone Dawn of the planet of the Apes had. Then the whole movie takes a huge breath as it gets much slower for more inner, personal momentums about character introducements and later developments, building up well layered and mostly complex roles. The WAR part is going both physically and mentally for the protagonist Caesar, and this battle requires more personal, less wide scenes in order to show character developments from the first seats. However when it is needed huge scenes take place on the big screen with plenty of ape s**t going down. The music is overall good, however thanks to the whole point of this third installment it will ofttimes bring too much sadness to the little, empathizing momentums, becoming very hollywoodish, and sometimes cheesy making the scenes around the grotesque looking apes look funny. But as I said at the beginning, the first 20 or so minutes is mesmerizing on every aspect: visuals, tone, music, narrative everything. And after that the movie sometimes has less achievements with the overused piano parts, but overall it is a good soundtrack, I personally love every part where old-school, hollywoodish sounds are coming in, reflecting on the movies made in the 70's. There are also Easter Eggs for the old timers and old fans with names showing up like Cornelius and Nova, but as it was mentioned in the interviews done with Matt Reeves (The Director) these are only nodes to the fans of the original movies showing how these names were introduced to this whole Ape Universe. However that being said they yet get too much screen times though, being Easter Eggs and all, but doesn't matter, because they are also there to bring factor to the empathy parts of the whole story and are also important for character motivations.So overall the movie is a long journey with interesting, complex characters on not so black and white basis. It is a well fitting sequel and a definitely good third (last) installment to this franchise making the whole trilogy coherent, well crafted but mostly an almost perfect GEM in the global Motion Picture History, a refreshing momentum for us all.

It definitely could have been shortened from 2 hours and 20 minutes, especially shooting the majority of the film in one location. The plot meandered too much. I found in IMDb that it wasn't my imagination that the colonel character is a very thinly veiled Colonel Kurtz from ""Apocalypse Now"". The acting is stellar, and as usual, Harrelson doesn't disappoint, despite the plagiarism of his character. If I saw the Apocalypse Now parallel so easily, then it cheapens the film. I give it a fair at 7 of 8. But it's barely there on action alone. Being a blockbuster, almost ensures it being a 7. But obviously they missed too many opportunities here in making a better story. I hope we see an improvement in the next film in the series.",War for the Planet of the Apes

265,bodhi-13262,"""I offered you Peace, I showed you Mercy...""",8,15 July 2017,"'War for the Planet of the Apes' is the third and (supposedly) final chapter in the Apes trilogy, but is it the best of the bunch or do things go bananas at this stage?1. Never have I been a major 'Planet of the Apes' fan until 2011 when 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' evolved into theaters. Tim Burton butchered the possibility of a franchise in his Mark Wahlberg- starring vehicle which literally slipped on a banana peel, but all hope wasn't lost. When Andy Serkis teamed up with directors Rupert Wyatt (Rise) and Matt Reeves (Dawn & War), the Apes had a successful revival and the tides finally turned. This film is a great example of what a great trilogy should be like, but it would be a shame for this to be the final one since myself and other fans are just hungry for more because there is still much more potential left as far as story goes.2. If any one person deserves an Oscar for an actor in a leading role, it would most definitely be Andy Serkis. His talent as an actor (at this point) is probably on par with Daniel Day-Lewis. Caesar the ape is by far the best CGI character/performance of this generation, even more so than Gollum. I can't stress enough how much I love this character, and WETA Digital's CGI has just gotten better throughout the years and the effects on this film surpasses even the likes of 'Avatar'. Karin Konoval (Maurice) and Terry Notary (Rocket) round out the cast of the original apes with a new addition of Steve Zahn as 'Bad Ape', who helps the group find their way in locating the military's base.3. After a tragic event early in the film, Caesar is forced to find a ruthless army 'Colonel' (Woody Harrelson) who has rogue apes working along with his militia to eradicate their own kind. This film has a lot of underlying messages in it's plot along with eliciting sheer emotion in simple yet effective ways that one wouldn't expect from films like these. If you're going into this expecting balls-to-the-wall action, don't get your hopes up because it's not that. At times (especially in the middle) it feels more like a quiet and philosophical film to the point where it slows down to an unnecessary level. It's obvious early on that 'War' is the least action-packed of the three, so beware.4. Apart from Caesar, the apes aren't any more evolved than they were in the previous, and I was hoping that at this point they were all fluent in speaking English rather than sign language. The undertones of slavery are expressed too much and has caused some controversy in social media. Some things needed to be more subtle instead of being overplayed. Most elements of the story aren't exactly new material, hence the reason why this film relies heavily on the outstanding performances. Director Matt Reeves does a great job once again and he definitely knows how to work with his actors to get such amazing choreographed performances. The film isn't flawless, and I hated that I didn't love it as much as I wanted to.I wanted this to be great even though I cried and felt so much emotional connection to the characters. 'Rise' is still my favorite of the trilogy but I still hold this film in high regards. It truly is a spectacle and one of the best films of the year so far. Go see it, go bananas and go to WAR!!!",War for the Planet of the Apes
266,scottingram,War For The Planet Of The Apes Film Review,8,17 July 2017,"War For The Planet Of The Apes the newest film in the rebooted film series of The Planet Of The Apes films franchise starring Woody Harrelson, Andy Serkis, Toby Kebbell.In War for the Planet of the Apes, the third chapter of the critically acclaimed blockbuster franchise, Caesar (English actor Andy Serkis - The Lord Of The Rings films, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) and his apes are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel known as The Colonel (American actor Woody Harrelson - Now You See Me films, Kingpin). After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind. As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the Colonel are pitted against each other in an epic battle that will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet.Amongst the other actors / actresses in War For The Planet Of The Apes includes American actor Steve Zahn (You've Got Mail, Out Of Sight) as Bad Ape, American actress Karin Konoval (Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, Diary Of A Wimpy Kid) as Maurice, Amiah Miller (Lights Out) as Nova, Terry Notary (Kong: Skull Island, Warcraft: The Beginning) as Rocket, Canadian actor Ty Olsson (X-Men 2, The Chronicles Of Riddick) as Red Donkey, Canadian actor Michael Adamthwaite (The Twlight Saga: New Moon, Warcraft: The Beginning) as Luca, English actor Toby Kebbell (Kong: Skull Island, The Counsellor) as Koba, Gabriel Chavarria (Freedom Writers, Lowriders) as Preacher, American actress Judy Greer (Jurassic World, Ant-Man) as Cornelia, Canadian actress Sara Canning (US TV Series The Vampire Diaries, Black Field) as Lake, Devyn Dalton (The Orchard) as Cornelius, Canadian actor Aleks Paunovic (Numb, Kindergarten Cop 2) as Winter, Canadian actor Alessandro Juliani (Man Of Steel, Chaos Theory) as Spear, English actor Max Lloyd-Jones (Finding Harmony, Field Of Lost Shoes) as Blue Eyes, Canadian actress Mercedes De La Zerda (Punch) as Lang, Canadian actor Chad Rook (The Wingman, Texas Road) as Boyle and Canadian actor Sandy Robson (Dead Rising: Endgame, Skyquake) as Gunner.War For The Planet Of The Apes was filmed in Vancouver and Tofino, British Columbia, Canada.Overall The War For The Planet Of The Apes is a good action ape film filled with action, violence, apes, human beings, shooting, explosions, guns, bows, arrows, weapons, the battle between the apes and the human beings, winter snowy mountains and scenery, some hard hitting scenes, loyalty, love, family, friendship, team work, togetherness, forests, big trees, waterfalls, some near misses, on the edge of your seat stuff, some bizarre scenes, some apes that look like the ape that use to appear in the Cadbury playing the drums to the Phil Collins song In The Air Tonight and the apes you use to see in the PG tea adverts and many other things throughout the film.So I will give War For The Planet Of The Apes an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and War For The Planet Of The Apes is worth seeing if you like all the previous Planet Of The Apes film like the ones from 2011, 2014, 2001 and the earlier films from the 60's and the 70's that Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowall, King Kong films, Warcraft: The Beginning, The Lord Of The Rings films, The Hobbit films, Godzilla films amongst others.So if you get the chance to see War For The Planet Of The Apes in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",War for the Planet of the Apes

268,CinePendejo,Enough with the ape movies and their APOCALYPSE NOW references!!,6,17 July 2017,"It seems unbelievable just how good the rebooted PLANET OF THE APES movies are. Just think about it: a prequel to a classic series from the ever-cynical FOX studios made by unknown directors sounds like the dumbest idea ever conceived. But with clever writing, smart sense of moral ambiguity, and awesome ape action, these became the studio tent pole Hollywood needed. Then they did it again with DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, with cooler action and a strong sense of ape-to-human dynamics. Those films proved that modern blockbusters didn't need explosions or mindless spectacle, but clever writing and exceptional motion capture CGI.So its kind of hard to admit that, despite all the good intentions and a strong central lead, WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES was kind of a disappointment.It has the same great performance by Andy Serkis and adds more levity to the ever-tested leadership of Caesar, but the film resorts to too much conveniences and referential shorthand to get there. Plagued by plot coincidences, a drawn out second act, two unnecessary characters, and on-the-nose references to the current political climate and other movies (most notably APOCALYPSE NOW, a movie that now been ripped off TWICE by another ape movie.)Woody Harrelson is the new bad human character, pretty much copying Marlon Brando's character from that movie as he hunts down the apes in order to stop the Simian Flu. After causing a tragic event, Caesar vows to kill him whilst rallying the remaining ape community to a much safer environment and forming a revenge squad. During a loooooong 2nd act, they meet a former zoo monkey who wounds up being the obligatory comedic relief, and a little girl who got the unfortunate Simian flu and Obligatory Plot Device Disease. But by painfully predictable circumstances it turns out Harrelson captured the ape community and rallied them up in order to make them work in concentration camps SCHINDLER LIST style to help them build a wall. (Yeah, get ready because these Trump-era blockbusters are not gonna stop these painful allegories any time soon...) Look I understand why this would seem to make sense: it's a film deeply rooted in fatigue from murder and it deals with characters desperate to stop all of this killing but still conflicted by their distrust with one another. And to its credit, the moments in which it doubles down on Caesar's growing lust for vengeance that ultimately compromises his will to lead his primates are still the most inspired. Sadly, director Matt Reeves doubles down too much on eye-rolling allegories like APOCALYPSE NOW, the current Trump-era climate, and a distasteful Holocaust imagery to get there. Visual shorthand like this would've been harmless, but it's up to a point where Caesar dons the Ben Willard role in the same third act bed scene with Harrelson's character, characters dying among an oppressive and predominantly white army, and the writing on the walls that say ""APE-POCALYPSE NOW"" (as if the whole Simian flu business or literal test animal apes against the man wasn't strong enough) It's all used for ham-fisted audience reaction rather than the organic gravitas from the last two films, and the result adds to a lot less than what they're shooting for.SPOILER PART!!!!Setting aside the clumsy visual cues, WAR is also plagued with cheap conveniences and clichés. Keep in mind, this is where people might call this section of the review as ""nitpicking"" but I'd say it's way too abundant and clumsy to ignore. There's a new ape character that serves as both a plot device and comedic relief, and one of too few female characters that's both mute and totally useless. Characters suddenly change motivation for no coherent reason other than when the plot needs them to. Despite a heavily evil fortress run by Harrelson and his evil human militia, it can be apparently thwarted by a leaking gas tank, an obligatory underground tunnel, oblivious patrolmen, and someone walking through an OPEN DOOR. Some underdeveloped characters die out of nowhere for added tension, yet explosions and avalanches doesn't seem to harm anyone in the slightest. All of this wouldn't matter in the slightest had there been something to chew on in the action scenes. But aside from a pretty good action scene in act 1 and a firefight in act 3, there's a long stretch of the second act that admirably tries to shoot for character development but winds up uneventful. It is such a deep shame that I am trashing this movie like this, because there is a lot of good things in this. Andy Serkis is amazing as always. Caesar remains one of the best new Hollywood characters. The whole thing boasts some incredible blockbuster filmmaking with great cinematography, grand-scale action (no matter how few), and state-of-the-art CGI. And it all tackles complex issues about the faith of humanity tested by our lack of communication and our dive into insanity. But I also wish it didn't think we're idiots with the rest of the movie by constantly shoving easy-ways-out and ""APE-POCALYPSE NOW"" or MONKEY HOLOCAUST. Sometimes material like this being good is a miracle, but this time I wish it was better.",War for the Planet of the Apes

270,mistela67,Can CGI Apes win Academy Awards?,9,14 July 2017,"Or will Mr. Serkis get the honors? This review will not reveal any real spoilers, although you can pick up on certain things, I suppose. I will say that I haven't watched a movie that evoked so much emotion within me for some time. The special effects was top notched. Close ups of the raw emotions of the computer generated apes was realistic and telling. I never got the feeling I wasn't watching ""real"" monkeys in action, even though I was. In fact, I'm very serious about Academy Award considerations. I can see Best Actor and Supporting Actor nominations down the line, if it's pushed. The story itself is quite simple. I wouldn't call the script the highlight of this movie, so don't expect any sort of dialogue that will ring within your ears and mind for hours afterwards. There was quite a bit of predictability, and nothing in the narrative delved into any profound sense of contemplation, plot twists, or anything that would get you thinking. It also wasn't much of a war movie, per se. Other than the very beginning, there was more emotional drama and tension than men and apes diving into fox holes. Don't get me wrong. The action and gun play were great throughout the movie. And the ending battle is eye- candy for those who like to see bullets and bombs on screen. But what you do get, moreso, with this movie is superb acting, both human and ape (CGI), and the exhibition of raw emotions, which moves you about the emotional spectrum.I never felt bored or tired watching WFPOTA. Although you sort of know where things will end up, the movie forces the emotions out of you. I laughed, I was anxious, I was nervous, and yes, even a tough guy like me will admit I teared up a bit. 9/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
271,Thekeybaldemasterrises,"Visually haunting and well executed. Best movie of 2017 so far, and definitely deserves a nomination.",9,14 July 2017,"If you're a fan of the last two Planet of the Apes look no further. This movie is a triumphant finale to a consistently great franchise. However I have to make it clear that the title is very misleading. It does say War, but there's very little to no action in the actual film. I already see people complaining about that and instantly giving the movie a negative review for having little action. So if you're only here for that then I'll just tell you right now skip, and go see Transformers the Last Knight which has plenty of mindless action if that's what you so desire. The bottom line is this movie is amazing. It's not even really anything original, it's just well executed. I mean everything, from the performances, to the special effects, the music, it's all so well done. I seriously hope Fox backs this movie into running for some Oscar nominations because this movie needs to be recognized for motion capture performance as a form of acting. Andy Serkis is nothing short of outstanding as Caesar who proves once again that even though it's all done trough effects it's the performance that's at the center of these characters. This movie War, leads you to believe it's about a war between Apes and Humans, but that's really not at all what you see. It's about the consequences of war, and what morality means for us in desperate situations. There's one scene in the movie between Caesar and Woody Harrelson's Colonel who explains to Caesar why he does what he does, and you honestly don't get up and go ""you're an awful man!"" When he explains himself after all of these nasty things this character has done throughout the film, you go well what you do in his position? How far are you willing to go to when your species is facing certain death against all odds? This movie asks you a lot of questions about what it means to be good, and what it means to be evil. It's very biblical, and I can tell Matt Reeves wanted this movie to be reminiscent of something you'd see in a WW2/ Exodus type movie where our hero is a prophet come to free his people. Caesar's story is basically like Moses and the Hebrews. It may be to on the nose for some, and it's definitely haunting to watch. However, if we don't keep reminding ourselves what happens when evil takes control of the situation we are going backwards and doom humanity into chaotic times. I felt drained after watching this film, but it flew by for me. Its a long movie and I didn't feel bored at all because despite it's slow pacing I was either entranced by the cinematography, or the effects on the characters, and even Michael Giaanchino's beautiful score. I will continue seeing it over and over because it deserves your money for it's technical achievement for the sci fi genre. I'm also a huge Batman fan and it brings me comfort knowing we have Matt Reeves taking over the Batman franchise just around the corner. Please go support this film, we need more movies like this from Hollywood and less like Transformers 5. And to the academy please nominate Andy Serkis what else does the man have to do to get a nomination? This honestly is the best movie of 2017 so far. For me it was Logan or Get Out but this was just spectacular. We shall see what else comes our way.",War for the Planet of the Apes
272,btkb,READ THIS REVIEW TO KNOW ALL OF REVIEWS OF Planet of the Apes franchise!,10,23 March 2020,"These are all of the Planet of the Apes movies I watched. I hope these reviews are helpful. I have different tastes in movies, so you may not agree with me. Some are just stories about them, which may help you decide whether to watch it or not.Planet of the Apes (1968) - The ending was a surprise since it looks like the astronaut witnessed what the future will look like and all. The apes were pretty good. Of course, CGI did not exist, so they were in costumes. Overall, it was great.Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) - I was surprised another astronaut had arrived. Of course, he got the same treatment like the previous human did since apes saw humans as animals. Basically, both of these movies are reverse roles, where humans are apes, and apes are like humans. The ending was different since they meet some sort of telepathic humans who was going to set a bomb that would destroy the planet. It's pretty good movie!Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) - Two of the apes we saw in the first two movies who saved the humans had to escape from the planet since it was going to be destroyed. Of course, they went back in time. The roles are reversed again. This time, the humans are surprised to see the apes talking. Sadly, they both die, but gave birth to a son named Caesar. Well, the name was something else. The ending was sad since both of the baby ape's parents died since the man did not want them to soon rule the Earth. Here, you will see how the apes ruled the Earth in the future.Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) - Caesar is fully grown, but he has to pretend he is a slave ape like the others, and that he is not allowed to speak since they will capture him. Of course, the owner who protected and took care of him dies because he doesn't want to take Caesar to the police. You see that later, Caesar and the other apes have war against the humans who treated them badly. It's pretty intense.Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) - Apes have their own territory, and Caesar has his own family. Humans are getting along with them and helping them. Of course, they have rules there too. The ending becomes intense when apes are fighting with apes since some did not like Caesar ruling. Watch these original movies!Planet of the Apes (2001) - Similar to the first Planet of the Apes movie. The difference is that the CGI started improving to where they did not use humans to where costumes. The thing is, it was really different than the original. The astronaut lands on Earth, where apes rule the planet. But before that, him and his crew at his timeline, sent an ape in space as an experiment. Of course, the ape disappears into some sort of orbit or particles. The man goes to retrieve him back, but he gets sucked into it. There, he is sent to the future where apes are ruled. The story is the same as the original, but this time, the humans can talk in this one. The ape that he sent in his timeline, turns out to be the king or the ruler of the planet, where they respected him. After the battle ended to where they accepted the humans, the man goes back to his timeline. This got confusing. General Thade is an ape that wanted to kill the man when he was there. After he came back to his timeline, he looks up at what appears to be the Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade, who had later escaped, also traveled back in time through the same electromagnetic storm and conquered humanity. Leo is descended upon by a swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters, all of whom are apes. It seems they wanted to make a sequel of this, but I guess they haven't. I do not blame for having low ratings to this since the ending was confusing, or the movie and storylines were bad.Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) - Completely different story to the first original one. This time, it is humans experimenting apes. The female ape goes berserk, and has to be taken down. They find out she is pregnant and gives birth. The baby ape is Caesar, who possesses human intelligence. The thing is, he later gets taken to the shelter along with other apes because of his immaturity or for what he has done to his neighbor for yelling at his owner's father. Nice of him to protect him. We then see Caesar becoming tougher since the guy in the shelter was being super mean to him. He then yells ""NO!"" which shocks the other apes and the man since he can talk. Of course, the battle between humans and apes starts. Best movie and special effects I have ever seen!Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) - We see the apes finding a colony. One of the ape, Koba, is different compared to Caesar when it comes to dealing with humans. He was abused by them, so we can see why he doesn't like them. Koba tries to kill Caesar for what he has decided. Caesar doesn't know this, and so, decided to attack him in the end because ""apes don't kill apes."" The problem with this was that Koba caused the apes to deal with more problems in the future since the man he negotiated with, had a friend who called in the military people about them. Caesar and the men told the humans that saved him to stay somewhere safe. Caesar and the other apes were preparing for the war against the military humans. This gets intense! Watch this movie!War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) - The title itself explains it all, along with the previous movie! The war is between the military army and apes. Throughout this movie, we see a sad scene where Caesar sees a Colonel killing his eldest son and his wife. He wanted revenge for what the Colonel has done. Of course, as he went, he gets captured at their base along with his other fellow apes. The Colonel explains about the simian flu his son had dealt with, and that he had lost his son because of the apes and their spread of disease. Later, with the help of a human child, who couldn't speak, along with another ape who could speak as well because he learned it by listening to the humans, help out the others, and got the apes to escape. Caesar was going to kill the Colonel, but he saw the Colonel having the simian flu as well. Instead, he left him to kill himself instead. Another army then comes who were after the Colonel and his men. Caesar blows up the base, along with that, was an avalanche which wiped out both of the armies. They, later, escaped, and they found a place where they can have peace. Sadly, Caesar dies because of his wounds and injuries. The girl stays with them. This movie is great! Best movie of all! Worth it!Watch all of it since I could be telling the story wrong!",War for the Planet of the Apes
273,mts-78680,"Less of a War than advertised, sigh",5,19 July 2017,"Definitely the worst of the series and hopefully the last. Sadly, they'll probably try to milk this into another one. The action was disappointing but the graphics/ape visuals were on par with other movies.No clue why Hollywood must always make one sided conflicts where losers look incompetent just to make winners look brilliant. Personally it shows a lack of creative genius in their writing/directing. OR it could just be their way of ensuring movie is completed on schedule with weak plots? Do yourself a favor and wait for video or do like I did and see it at a matinée (which was still too much $$).",War for the Planet of the Apes

275,javi-y-se-acabo,"The Movie Title and the Trailers Were Wrong. Anyway, An Epic Finale to This Amazing Trilogy.",9,7 September 2017,"So, about the title and the trailers, I think many people went to this movie expecting WAR. I know, that's what the trailers sold us and I understand that maybe this has make many people disappointed. But this movie is by far better than just monkeys versus humans, and explosions and so. It also has that but is more dark and complex than that.It tells us the story of how, after two years from the previous movie, the apes are fighting the human army, trying to survive. Then when they're about to travel to a new land where they could live in peace, Caesar knows about the Colonel and he starts seeking for revenge for something he has done to him. The story is very dark and at times it has a complex feeling. It's not mindless action. It's about how an ape and his companion try to save his race over the human one. He has to make sacrifices and he has to face the horrors of war.The cast is amazing. And for that we have to talk about Andy Serkis and the Motion Capture. I really think that he deserves an Oscar. Since Gollum in Lord of the Rings he has created a lot of other characters with the motion capture technique: Gollum, King Kong, Captain Haddock, Supreme Leader Snoke in Star Wars and Caesar in this amazing trilogy. He gives a very powerful performance as the ape leader and the CGI is amazing because now it allows to transmit the exact faces expressions of Andy Serkis, as well as the other actors, into the apes. In the human side we have Woody Harrelson as the Colonel. He has a lot of charisma and he, with Caesar, provides very powerful moments, where you only have acting, music and tension, no dialogue and that makes it even more powerful. Also you have that little girl, Nova (Amiah Miller) who also was great and despite she could not talk, she gave a very good performance along with the apes. If I had to remark some bad things of the movie, it would probably be the introduction of the Bad Ape, a new character introduced as a comic relief that at times I felt it was out of place. The other thing that didn't really convinced me, was how the problem with the human army was solved. I won't spoil anything but I felt it was a bit stupid, but the rest of the movie is so good that for me it didn't ruined it a lot.Well, I have already mentioned it. The visuals are amazing, not only the apes created with the CGI but also the landscapes and the cinematography were beautiful and provided some very powerful moments as I have said above this. Also a very special mention to Michael Giacchino who created one of his best scores ever. He develops some of his themes from Dawn and creates new ones, giving the movie an epic feeling, but also very emotional and at times dark.As I have said, this is one of the finest blockbusters of the year, along with Baby Driver and Dunkirk and this is how this kind of movies should be like. With action, very entertaining but also with a good story, great characters, and with a heart. Also this is a very good end to this great trilogy that is now among the best trilogies of the cinema for me. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the previous ones or just wants to watch a blockbuster made with head and heart. The only thing I have to say is: Please, sell the movie for what it is, not for what you want us to believe it is.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Too much ape dialogue was in sign language, we even considered putting the subtitles on at one point. The SFX is impressive and makes the film watchable but by a thin margin. Technically and logically there is so much wrong with this movie to the point of being ridiculous. Based on the ending, we assume that will be the last Planet of the Apes movie. If this one was the best they can do then it will not be a bad thing. Will we be watching it again, highly unlikely.",War for the Planet of the Apes
278,littleging12,"I have learned only one thing from ""War for the Planet of the Apes,"" most IMDb users are trolls",6,27 August 2017,"""War for the Planet of the Apes"" concludes the prequel trilogy of the legendary franchise on a less than stellar note. It features beautiful cinematography, masterful motion capture work, complex character arcs, and a storyline full of allegorical depth. However, the film gets bogged down by repetitiveness, slowness, emptiness, and lots of bad cinemasin-worthy moments. ""War"" starts out really good with visually stunning and thrilling action scenes. And after that those scenes don't come around again for awhile. ""War"" tries to fill that void with emotional depth, character development, and deep metaphorical meaning. To a certain extent it succeeds in trying to fill those voids. Caesar's quest of vengeance strikes haunting parallels to Koba's from the previous films. It's very interesting seeing Caesar becoming the one thing he told apes never to be. The storyline is very similar to that of ""Apocalypse Now"" in how a man (ape) must journey down a dark path to kill an insane colonel while confronting his own demons. Also Woody Harrelson's striking resemblance to Colonel Kurtz and the graffiti of Ape-pocalypse Now are dead giveaways. The story is also allegorical to racial discrimination, the holocaust, the Nazi regime, and Biblical epics. The filmmakers here had really good ideas to avoid making this another brainless blockbuster. They just couldn't keep it together for the full 2 hrs. and 20 mins.After the halfway point, the movie begins to drag. Logically some scenes don't make any sense and took me out of the emotion, psychological battles and the inevitable war to come. Every film has their small 'sins' that you can spot if you're watching closely. Since the second act of ""War"" didn't have much happening anyway, these 'sins' were a lot more noticeable and detrimental. For example the little mute girl weeps over the death of an ape she shared two scenes with and didn't even shed a tear when her guardian was killed. Later on, she just casually walks into the prison camp to feed Caesar in a heart to heart moment where all the guards were either sleeping or past out drunk. Then one of those same incompetent guards enters the prison cell with hundreds of apes demanding to know who threw poo at him as he is then pulled underground and beaten. Like he couldn't just figure it out from his protected elevated position? During the final battle sequence the entire defensive wall position is blown up when one gas tank is destroyed. They couldn't have put that tank somewhere else? Finally why did the Colonel keep Caesar alive for so long knowing that all the apes looked to him for inspiration and hope?""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is probably much better than I am letting on to be, but after the halfway point I became completely disengaged and really stopped caring. In a film so ambitiously deep they stupidly overlooked glaring holes in the film resulting in a lackluster conclusion to not only the film but the whole prequel trilogy as well. 6.5/10 People need to chill with the abysmal reviews of this film.",War for the Planet of the Apes
279,ToxicJug,A Decent Send off to Cesar's Story,7,28 June 2021,"War for the Planet of the Apes may not be as good as its two predecessors but it still manages to send the trilogy off on a high note. I may have mentioned this in both of my reviews for the previous two films but its simply impossible not to mention when reviewing this trilogy. The visuals throughout this film absolutely steals the show! War for the Planet of the Apes easily has the most convincing visual effects of the entire trilogy which is obviously an impressive feat to say the least. The action sequences are also incredible as expected from this trilogy by this point. Where the film falls behind for me in comparison however, is it's pacing as well as its ending. War is paced nowhere near as well as the first two and can feel a bit slow and even boring at times which was a major issue for me. Ontop of that the ending just wasn't satisfying for me at all especially given that it was the finale of Cesar's story. Cesar's story and his legacy is something that has been built throughout the entirety of this trilogy and ends rather abruptly within this film.. other than those issues, this is still an incredible sci-fi action film that will tug on your heartstrings as much as it will have you cheering on the edge of your seat!",War for the Planet of the Apes
280,theVade,A solid film in a fantastic trilogy.,7,17 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes was a good film that provided some of the best CGI I have ever seen, and some of the best characters out of any series. Although it is a great addition to the already great series, it is probably my least favorite movie out of the three as its long runtime, weird pacing, and mediocre villain aren't as memorable as the ones that came before it. I decided to give War for the Planet of the Apes a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10, as it is a solid film in a fantastic trilogy. Although this is a movie titled ""War"" it features very little of it, and its marketing is very deceptive, but what it makes up for in references, characters, and CGI is worth the watch, and worth the wait for a future Planet of the Apes remake.Read more at theVade.",War for the Planet of the Apes
281,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,A perfect conclusion to Caesar's story of humanity.,9,15 July 2017,"What has fascinated me about this trilogy is how it explores the idea of humanity through the eyes of an animal learning to become human. Each film has its lead Caesar overcoming a certain emotional obstacle and in this final chapter we see him go up against his greatest one yet: himself.When we enter War, we feel that the world has gotten bleaker since the end of Dawn. The humans of compassion and fairness like Will and Malcolm from the previous films no longer exist. The last of human society are now just military fanatics who see that the apes must either be wiped out or enslaved to ensure their own survival. Like past Ape films, War can be seen as a dark reflection of upon our own society from enslaved and abused apes resembling Holocaust victims to the Colonel drawing inspiration from real power-hunger fanatical leaders like Hitler to Trump whom lead a legion of blind, faithful followers. Despite its title, War is actually less focused on explosive battles but more on the internal battle within ourselves, whether you're an ape or human. Director Matt Reeves shows how war can dehumanize the compassionate by examining Caesar's emotional arc through the story. After a tragic incident, we see Caesar change from being the merciful leader we know him as to an individual on a path of revenge who begins distancing himself from his loved ones and his own humanity. We question if he can return to being the ape he once was to lead his people or end up destroying himself like his former ally Koba. In contrast, the human villain the Colonel is someone who has allowed the war to strip away all of his humanity, compassion and mercy to ensure that Caesar's race won't subjugate his own by whatever means necessary. As the story progresses, we even see that both sides end up turning on themselves out of desperation and fear.While War is the darkest of trilogy, it does offer some lightness to the bleak tone. The characters like Maurice the orangutan and the mute human child Nova offer an emotional anchor that keeps Caesar from losing his humanity all at once. Maurice acts as Caesar's conscious to ensure he won't end up hurting himself and anyone else unnecessarily. Nova shows to be the only human that has actual humanity thanks to her innocence and bond with Maurice. And a big surprise is Steve Zahn's new character Bad Ape who doesn't just to exist to be a joke in the film but offers necessary levity and proves to be very instrumental in the journey of the apes.Regardless if Andy Serkis finally gets that Oscar nomination next year for his mo-cap role as Caesar, he has still proved he is one of the greatest actors working today. Serkis does not need words to show you the mental state of Caesar. You see that in his final role as Caesar he gives the best performance of his career as he puts every thought and care into how Caesar expresses himself including dark aspects you have never before seen. And the dynamic between him and Woody Harrelson as the Colonel offers some of the best scenes in the film. While he may seem like the film's version of Colonel Kurts from Apocalypse Now at first, Harrelson goes beyond what you expect of him as a usual villain and shows a layer of complexity and emotion that is beyond what I expected. In Dawn, Matt Reeves stepped in to take over what Rupert Wyatt started with. Here he shows more creative control in this then in Dawn (which is nothing against it). As I said before, Reeves is more much invested in character's motivations and decisions then action but that doesn't stop from him making it look rough and gritty. And he lets the visuals and character's emotions guide the story instead of dialogue exposition. Moments with no music let you feel the emotion and sense of isolation that surrounds the characters. And the music by the way is probably the best of Michael Gianchino's work that I have heard yet.And what can I say about the visuals. WETA has now made me completely forget I am watching a cgi character. The way the apes's skin and fur reflects and absorbs light and the snow dripping from their faces definitely says War will be winning a lot of visual effects awards in the near future. Aside from stunning cgi, other visuals that should be taken notice are the cinematography shots from Michael Seresin. As Caesar's group travel across the post-apocalyptic wilderness, the shots of the haunting but yet stunning and beautiful landscapes show how bleak the world is. And we feel how menacing the forces of nature really are.War for the Planet of the Apes may not only be the best entry in one of the best trilogies ever made but may be one of the best movies I have ever seen. I found such a difficult time finding a flaw in this film. It brings Caesar's journey to ensure his people's place as the next rulers of the planet to a fitting and emotional close with lots of tears being shed. War for the Planet of the Apes is hands down a masterpiece.",War for the Planet of the Apes
282,rebeccalucy,A good watch...,6,2 January 2018,"The effects in these series of films are absolutely stunning, so much effort is put into every movement. This is definitely the closest films have come from being unrecognisable as computer generated effects. Andy Serkis and his team are incredible, they obviously are so hardworking and deserve a lot of praise. However, the human acting is not as phenomenal in comparison. The young girl is decent but she is never given development like the rest of the apes. Woody Harrelson's character goes back and forth with his motivations a little. Sometimes the plot is lacking, and the ""War for the planet of the apes"" is not really as climatic as it could be. However, I believe the characters can make up for it. Throughout these films I really came to care about these apes. Also, another thing that was unique was the opening credits highlighting the titles of all the previous films. Overall, a beautiful film with great characters!",War for the Planet of the Apes
283,razvan-rogoz,Leave your brain at the door if you want to see this movie.,5,20 October 2017,"I'm saying this because the plot doesn't make any sense and there are so many forced moments that it feels more like a telenovela than a big budget action movie.It is an emotional roller-coaster where the conclusion is clear - the monkeys get to live on while the human race dies. Am I'm supposed to hate the humans and love the monkeys? I'm a human being. They can be portrayed as inhuman but at the end of the day, logic dictates that if one of the two species is to survive, it is to be the one I'm part of.The audience is not made out of monkeys. It is made out of human beings. Yet, am I'm supposed to feel happy and satisfied at the end?It is 2:15 hours long and the plot feels so convoluted that I had to ask several times ""how long is this going to take?"". This is no Lord of the Rings. The entire plot could have been done in 90 minutes and it would have been a far better movie.There are plot holes galore. It is the kind of movie where the special forces guy hits everything apart the important plot character, where a colonel designs a military fortress complete with anti-air launchers but leaves a huge tanker filled with gasoline next to the entry and so on. I've seen worse writing but for this kind of budget, the scriptwriter should be ashamed of himself.Unless the humans were complete idiots or braindead, 90% of what happened in this movie could not happen. The irony is that the last one made so much more sense and it was far more credible. This is just supposed to be an emotional roller-coaster that if you analyze on a logical level, you start hitting slapping yourself for wasting your time watching it.The only redeeming parts are the sign language and the entire ""heart of darkness"" type of subplot, with a short philosophical discussion between the villain and Caesar. But honestly, while that discussion raises my objection about the entire plot itself (that the humans are doing just what is needed to survive and that they're not the real villains), it feels like those 2 minutes were directed by someone else.This movie represents everything is wrong with the cinema today. I don't hate it for the production values, those were decent. I hate it because it treats the audience like freakin' idiots that can't see how none of the pieces fit together. Dear script-writer, please don't direct another one.",War for the Planet of the Apes
284,ReelLifeReviews,An accomplished trilogy,8,16 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes - When is the Academy going to wake up and nominate Andy Serkis? Not recognizing his achievements in motion capture has them looking like the knuckle-draggers.At the very least the rumor is that this movie was shot with motion capture, but I'm not too sure. I'm more inclined to believe that they found a bunch of apes that spoke English, and decided to cast them in the movie. We didn't quite reach the uncanny valley with Tarkin in Rogue One, but it sure seems like we've reached the animal equivalent with every ape in this film.Playing one of these (apparently) CGI apes is Steve Zahn, someone I hadn't seen in a movie in years. And while I guess I still haven't technically seen him, he makes his presence felt. He's introduced a little deep into the story, but brings a welcome dose of levity from thereon out. Looking back to both Rise and Dawn, there really weren't any comedic characters, or all that many moments come to think of it. Again, Andy Serkis is incredible with everything he brings to Caesar, but Zahn finds a way to steal the show.Earlier in the year I mentioned how John Wick 2 had surprised me with how much I enjoyed its score. Well, I was equally as surprised with how much I didn't care for this one. It felt very heavy-handed, trying to be more grandiose than what the scenes seemed to call for. Other times it came off extremely cheesy, utilizing metallic wind chimes for tender moments, and tubas for bumbling ones. As it turns out, it's Michael Giacchino, the composer for the aforementioned Rogue One. I thought I didn't quite appreciate the score as much for that film because it wasn't John Williams, but it would seem I'm just not a fan of his in general.One of the main successes of the previous two films was that you could sympathize with both sides. They each had their flaws, but you could also see the good in them. In War, it leans solely to one faction, leaving the other side as just a group of mustache twirling villains. Adopting this structure and abandoning the former was an odd turn for the franchise to take.Rest assured, the positives easily outweigh the negatives here. Prior to viewing I was touting the possibility of this being one of the best trilogies ever. It seems like a lofty goal, but other trilogies, with the exception of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, dropped the ball with their third installment- The Dark Knight, Back to the Future, The Matrix, and on and on. Star Wars will always be the best trilogy in the galaxy, but as far as the others are concerned, hail Caesar.",War for the Planet of the Apes

286,carlo_simone18,Mostly Satisfying Conclusion to the Trilogy,6,30 December 2017,"This was certainly an interesting finish to the trilogy, as there wasn't really a war as was stated in the title of the film, but instead more of a character piece for Caesar as he struggles with the darker elements of his character.Caesar is once again portrayed brilliantly by Andy Serkis with amazing CGI bringing his character, and all the other apes, to life in stunning fashion. The direction from Matt Reeves was solid as well, with some lovely cinematography accompanying it. The main antagonist in the Colonel was an intriguing one as his motivations were completely understandable in attempting to save humanity, which was in great contrast to Caesar who's own motivations were muddled at that point.However, the pacing was slow which weighed the film down in the second act and some story elements, whilst well-done, were rather predictable. The character of Bad Ape was thankfully not annoying like I feared, but as he served as more of a comic relief character he felt a bit out of place in the narrative.Overall, I prefer Dawn to War but this is a fitting enough end to the trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes
287,inforaza,Where is the promised WAR? Why is the movie so slow?,1,22 July 2017,"If you've not seen War of the Planet of Apes, here's a Warning: THERE IS NO WAR IN THE MOVIE AT ALL! What exist are just skirmishes between humans and the imprisoned apes who were trying to escape.In fact, it is a FLOP movie! Only 15 people were watching the show.The first 75% of the movie is very, very slow and the movie is 30 minutes too long (actual length is 2hr 20 mins). This is because the story-writer hopelessly failed to think of ways to add Thrill and a real War – but, instead, made the plot move at a snails' pace just to elongate the movie time.In fact, this film could easily have finished in 1 hr and 30 minutes. Not a second more.The movie ends in an ""unconvincing"" manner: One military faction is eliminated by another military group. And this group is eliminated by a roaring Avalanche. This helps the apes to escape to the dessert they were planning to relocate on.NOTE: The Avalanche was created because the story-writer could not think of a way for the apes to attack and defeat the military faction. How Convenient! LOL! The only great thing about this movie is the CGI which makes the apes look 100% realistic. The Avalanche too looks realistic. The visuals and cinematography is great.WPA is an extremely ""unconvincing"" end to a trilogy whose first 2 episodes are just Moving & Thrilling – which touched your heart and mind.

290,regula1,A trilogy concludes in powerful style,9,13 July 2017,"Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar.There's no getting around the power of his performance in this, the conclusion of the prequel Apes trilogy of films. In Rise, he portrayed the character of Caesar as a fast-maturing ape who was learning to grapple with his human side. In Dawn, we say that humanity firmly take hold after what was left of his peaceful ape habits began to fade.Now, in War, like Darth Vader, his goodness is in constant battle with his darker side, and the result is at times chilling but also heart- warming to see the good shine through once again.This Apes film is unique in the prequel trilogy as it mostly centers on the plight of the apes rather than the humans. In the previous two, we saw humanity as being on the short stick of its own arrogance, and the survivors learned to co-exist.Now, humans are shown through the lens of warriors only, specifically that of the Colonel played by Woody Harrelson. While his subordinates get the obligatory expendable-soldier treatment, the Colonel is a far more complex character who, while you condemn his actions, you understand his motivations, truly the kind of villain that good writing is capable of bringing to the screen.On the Apes side, with the exception of a couple of expendable characters with little to say about them, all of the characters we are introduced to are well fleshed-out and have interactions that contribute to the plot without needless exposition, the way it should be done.If there are any faults to this film, aside from its length, which by the end did start to feel it once the action ended, there were the references to the original Planet of the Apes. Up front, there are three obvious ones, and of these two are very in-your-face and after the initial reference are said again and again to point it is distracting, but in a movie such as this these are minor gripes.The original sequels to the original Planet of the Apes were less than stellar, but this capping-off of this prequel trilogy is up there as almost matching the quality of the original, sure to be remembered as a classic in the years to come.",War for the Planet of the Apes

The character of 'Bad ape' was very funny and he represented a breath of fresh air for the cruel and dark atmosphere present throughout the movie. And well, it was good to see again to all the main characters of the first two (Caesar, Maurice, etc.) after a few years.Andy Serkis as Caesar was once again excellent and also everybody else, including the new characters added to the story (Woody Harelson was for me one of the most despicable villains of the saga).7/10 Worth to watch, the animation was awesome and realistic, and the movie is good in general.

Of course, the premise sounds strange to people who don't necessarily belong to the sci-fi fans. Why I nevertheless want to recommend this film to everyone: you actually forget at some point that they are apes. The grief, despair and bitterness are portrayed so humanly that the viewer is incredibly empathized to the protagonists.

Kurtz, and Caesar the Ape King playing the flawed and conflicted role of assassin Willard.The humans are fragmented into tribal groups, organized around former military bases. The main ape tribe unfortunately sets up camp by one of the more insane and nastier of those groups, that enjoys slaughtering apes and their children en masse and sport catchy phrases on their helmets like 'Bedtime for Bonzo'.After the humans kill his wife and oldest son, Caesar must choose between trying to save the rest of his tribe or go on a scalp hunt for the crazed Kurtz-styled leader of the humans, masterfully played by Woody Harrelson. Woody really wanted to play an ape, and argued unsuccessfully for that, but in the end, Brando would have been proud and he balances the mentally frail and unbalanced survivor with the crazed psychopath exterior. Andy Serkis also delivers in his masterful portrayal of Caesar, haunted by visions of his dark half now dead brother in arms, Kobo, and when he must choose violence and when he must turn the cheek.There's little to complain about in this finale, even the comic sidekick character is amusing and well played. In a summer of so far dismality, this movie shines above as a near perfect ending to a fantastic reboot trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes
296,iamjacksmoviechannel,The Capper to a classic trilogy,10,11 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes, the third film in what I would call a classic trilogy, probably the best all-around set of three we've gotten in the 21st Century, hands down. This is why we go to the movies. In 2011 no one was expecting much from another Planet of the Apes movie, especially after the Tim Burton debacle 10 years before it. But we came away from it not only entertained, but with a feeling that we just watched an iconic character being born. Caesar will be to apes what Hugh Jackman is to Wolverine and right now both are looking like Oscar contenders, finally. Both characters are also involved in a war of another's making, also against humans. Caesar has agreed that those in his tribe must go to higher ground for their own protection and he even stays behind to lead the military away from the rest of them. This is a Caesar we've seen go from innocent child to cruelly-treated animal to fair and peaceful leader to the regrettable warrior he's had to become because Koba, the ape he trusted, threw him back into this fight. He wanted nothing more than protection for his family and tribe. Anyone who thinks Andy Serkis isn't doing some of the best acting they've ever seen here has no idea what acting even is. The ape-body movements have almost become second nature now to the severe emotions of guilt and anger that Caesar is going through. Serkis is bringing all that out and no, if he does win something that doesn't mean that he has to bring all the visual effects people up with him. Did Daniel Day Lewis have to bring up the make-up people when he won for ""Lincoln""? No. Why is this any different? The motion- capture performer needs to be recognized, and there has been no better than Serkis. I also love that Caesar is also fighting this final battle here and his same brothers who helped him escape captivity in the first film voluntarily are right along with him for this. It has a ""Saving Private Ryan""/ ""Band of Brothers"" type vibe, and this is not the only time i'll be making reference to other war films throughout this review. But yeah these are a lovable and gentle group of 5 apes, so chill and laid back but willing to do anything for Caesar and that is really cool and really touching, particularly the relationship between Caesar and Maurice. Steve Zahn also joined the pack as a comic relief ape who sorta reminded me a bit of Dobby, but he's OK. And remember I told you I would be making more references to war movies? Well Woody Harrelson's villain is a brilliantly conceived psychopath who definitely compares to a classic character from film history, but I won't say who for fear of giving too much away. But I will say Harrelson is perfect for something like this and is the best villain this summer so far. A major amount of credit should be given to director Matt Reeves, and screenwriters Mark Bomback, Rick Jaffa, and Amanda Silver, least of which for making an ape riding on horseback so much cooler, and less stupid, with each passing movie. The fact that Reeves is going to be directing the next Batman movie is particularly interesting to me because the guy doesn't revel in violence in any way. His work on these Apes movies is of violence as a sad necessity. That's Caesar, and that's also more of a Batman people can get behind. Yes, battles bookend this film and there is also a pretty neat avalanche sequence towards the end but this is a summer blockbuster that doesn't feel the need to give us one over-the- top action sequence after the next and you know what, it proves that's OK. It has a somber tone but is never depressing. There's a great theme here linking consciousness and the darker parts of human nature, and the film runs the gamut of being heartbreaking, moving, suspenseful, and even inspiring. Yes, Caesar being tied to a cross in one scene is a bit on the nose as far as symbolism, but he's earned it. Lastly, Michael Giacchino's musical score just sends this finale of Caesar's saga off right. The whole series has just been outstanding. This is what happens when you devote efforts to the here and now rather than to some distant universe (looking at you The Mummy) and on making sure plot threads make sense and have purpose (looking at you Transformers). It's also what happens when your lead actor is fantastic, when the heart is in the right place, when the goal is the make something that stands the test of time and that will make people want to automatically want to go back to it and say that was one hell of a hero that series created. If you know me, you know I don't usually overstate things but this is a classic up there with Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Nolan's Batman trilogy.

Notice the quotation marks. Usually, the third one in a planned trilogy is actually bad. Now, this is not better than the first two, but it's still not a bad movie. So, let's get to the review.Synopsis: Caesar and his apes are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel. After the apes suffer unimaginable losses, Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and begins his own mythic quest to avenge his kind. As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the Colonel are pitted against each other in an epic battle that will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet. Starring: Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson Director: Matt ReevesThe Ugly: Don't get me wrong on this account. Woody Harrelson did a great job in the movie. He is a phenomenal actor. He shines at everything he does. It's just there was a lack of strong human presence in this movie. That could attributed to the fact that the human race is diminishing as the ape population grows, but there was a serious lack. One could argue that the movie was all about the apes and I could see that. This is just my thought on the matter.The Bad: Without giving the ending away, the ending was more than a little convenient. Yes, you could see it coming a mile away, but still. Convenience doesn't really work that way in a war.The Good: Going back to the quotations above, one would think the set up at the very end of the movie was an actual fitting ending. But now we have some Hollywood big wig out there seeing dollar signs. What I am saying here is that it leads right into the original series. There is no need to make any more movies. But the lead up through the whole movie, you'll see why I say that, to the most recognizable place in all the films was brilliant.Final Thoughts: Out of this trilogy alone, it is the worst of the three. But it is still an excellent movie I strongly suggest everyone to watch. A definite worthwhile action/adventure with a bit of comedy from Steve Zahn.Rating: 8 out of 10That's it for me folks.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I was incredibly disappointed. The first 10-20 minutes were...pretty good...but then it all went downhill from there and THERE IS NO WAR IN THE MOVIE AT ALL! In fact, this film could easily have finished in 1 hr and 30 minutes. Not a second more. The third movie is bad.Two years after the U.S. military was called to fight off an increasingly intelligent and dangerous tribe of apes,led by the chimpanzee Caesar, are attacked in the woods by a Alpha-Omega, led by a ruthless Colonel. Alpha-Omega also has in its service apes they call ""donkeys"" that had previously followed Koba (the monkey). During the attack, the Alpha-Omega militants are met by heavy ape resistance, and several soldiers, including a ""donkey"" gorilla named Red, are captured by the apes. Caesar arrives and orders the four human soldiers to be released, with a message to the Colonel that he did not start the war, and that he desires peace between the humans and apes. Caesar orders that Red is to be imprisoned for his crimes, but before he can be imprisoned, Red escapes, injuring an albino gorilla named Winter. Soon after, Caesar's son Blue Eyes and his lieutenant Rocket return from a journey to find a safe haven for the apes. They report that they have found a place across the desert that is perfect for the clan. Winter, still frightened from the soldiers' attack, wants to leave immediately, but Caesar does not think they are prepared to leave so soon. That night, a group of Alpha-Omega soldiers, led by the Colonel, infiltrates the apes' home behind a waterfall and the Colonel kills Caesar's wife, Cornelia, and Blue Eyes. Winter cannot be found and he betray the apes.Leaving his younger son, Cornelius, in the care of Blue Eyes' mate, Lake, Caesar departs to exact revenge on the Colonel for the death of his family. He is accompanied by some apes, while the other apes head for the desert. During their journey, the apes encounter a soldier living in an abandoned village and Caesar shoots him when he reaches for his rifle. Caesar, Maurice, Luca, and Rocket search the dead soldier's home. Maurice discovers the soldier's daughter who is apparently unable to speak. Maurice befriends and adopts the girl, giving her a small rag doll.Along the way Caesar's party encounters Winter in an Alpha-Omega camp on the beach. He tells Caesar's group that the Colonel has departed for a location referred to as the ""border."" Winter tries to call out to the Alpha-Omega soldiers to save him, but Caesar and the others killing him. Caesar begins to worry that he is becoming like Koba by killing his fellow apes and seeking revenge. While following the soldiers to the border, they discover some soldiers who have been shot and left for dead. Their examination of a soldier who survived reveals that he, like the girl, cannot speak. Later the group meets Bad Ape. Bad Ape reveals that the human soldiers are encamped at the border.When the group arrives at the border, Luca is killed protecting Caesar from an Alpha-Omega patrol, angering Caesar and causing him to proceed alone. Caesar discovers the rest of his ape clan has been captured, and are being forced to build a wall with no food or water; he is captured by Red. The Colonel reveals to Caesar that the Simian Flu virus has mutated and now causes humans who becoming mute and regressing back to a primitive state. Caesar deduces that the Colonel is barricading himself in the facility to fend off remnants of the U.S. Army from the north who are coming to execute him because he favors massacring any infected humans, including his own son, to stop the spread of the virus. Caesar is commended by the Colonel for his intelligence, and the Colonel explains that he is fighting a ""holy war"" for the survival of mankind.While Caesar is in the camp, the mute girl sneaks into the facility to give Caesar food, water, and her rag doll. To prevent Nova from being discovered, Rocket allows himself to be captured as a diversion. The next day, the Colonel comes to see if Caesar is still alive, and confiscates Nova's doll upon discovering it. Together Caesar and Rocket are able to work out a means of escape via an underground tunnel that leads out of the facility. Maurice and Bad Ape use the tunnel to rescue the apes, and Caesar orders the others to escape while he goes to confront the Colonel. As the facility comes under attack by the northern army, Caesar reaches the Colonel. As Caesar is about to kill the Colonel, he realizes that Nova's doll has infected the Colonel with the mutated virus, rendering him unable to speak. Caesar puts down his gun and spares the Colonel, who then uses the gun to commit suicide rather than become a primitive.During the battle between Alpha-Omega and the northern army, the escaping apes come under fire from Alpha-Omega. Caesar attempts to attack Alpha-Omega forces from behind, but is shot with a crossbow by Preacher. Red saves Caesar's life by killing Preacher with a grenade launcher, and is executed by an Alpha-Omega superior as a result. Caesar blows up a large fuel tank, causing a cascade of explosions which destroy the Alpha-Omega facility and allow the northern army to win the battle. However, the army is subsequently devastated by an avalanche, which Caesar and the other apes, carrying Nova, survive by climbing nearby trees.The remaining apes depart the facility and cross the desert to find an oasis.

The whole Caesar ends up in a concentration camp with his Apes could have been done in 30 minutes and hey presto! The movie could have been 1 and a half hours of more concise story-line. I saw other people saying the writers had copied other films and I agree. The whole Caesar sets out to find the Colonel and kill him picking up 2 sidekicks along the way Lord of the Rings and another thousand movies.

The first part of the movie the attack by Special Forces annoying, after 15 years most of the Apes still carry spears. Despite being able to climb trees easily and post sentries, the humans still crept up on their base. And how were they wiped out, by a sudden storm of hundreds of perfectly arced spears falling into their midst.

Andy Serkis once again delivers an amazing performance as Cesar and makes the most-effective argument yet that motion-capture performances don't just deserve, but need to be recognized by the Academy. Woody Harrleson is also a great addition to the cast portraying a complex antagonist who fits right in with the strong characters within this universe. The action-scenes are top-not as always and one has to give major props to Director Matt Reeves and the writers for having the guts to tackle a big-budget summer blockbuster with such a dark and grim tone (all within the PG-13 limits of course). The main issue with War is that it's story isn't near as strong as the previous entries in the series. This is in part because while this has always been Caesars journey, the films focusing on him as well as human characters has added a complex layer that is missing here. This installment focuses only on Caesar and the apes, therefore removing an element that made the last two installments as great as they were. The main issue though is when in the films second-half it goes from what starts out as pretty strong Sci-Fi Drama to a routine prison escape movie. For a series that has been acclaimed for it's strong writing, effects, and originality, was this really the best they could give us? When it comes to this portion of the film, it slows down dramatically and ends up feeling rather dull almost as if the writers wanted to shoehorn some weird tribute to WWII films such as The Great Escape out of nowhere. Although it does all lead up to a rather fantastic action sequence, that same scene concludes on a complete cop-out that will even the most forgiving viewers rolling their eyes. While Harrelson also plays a great character, he unfortunately feels underused considering how much depth he had.I really did have high hopes for this film considering how excellent the last two were and the early praise for this one and while I wouldn't go as far to say it's a bad film, it's certainly a disappointing one. While it still has the impressive visuals and performances that he series has been recognized for, it's story and script leaves a lot to be desired making it easily the weakest installment in the series and one of the more disappointing films of the year so far.",War for the Planet of the Apes
307,brainsmasher-66,The summer of crappy movies that slay at the box office.....,3,16 July 2017,"....continues. There are some really good scenes in this movie. If you have seen the trailers then you have seen all of the good parts. I didn't think they could make a sillier movie than the last one; but they did. Who was the target audience--preschoolers? Just sayin.The opening battle scene is fantastic. There was no way they could top that. They didn't even try. If you're gonna make a movie with talking apes make them all talk like the Planet of the Apes movies in the 60s and 70s. Only one ape can talk; but he reads sign language. The other apes cannot talk; but they all use sign language. A couple of apes can only talk baby talk or maybe they are trying to mimic the retarded. Excuse me, I should use more politically correct terms like mentally challenged or differently abled or people with cognitive disabilities. Nope, I can't do it. They talked like retards.The ape that some people claim is supposed to be a caricature of DeRay McKesson is the silliest character in the movie. He is supposed to be the comic relief ala Jar Jar Binks. Every time he was on screen I couldn't help thinking retard alert from South Park.I do not buy that Hollywood is using this movie to send coded references of the apes as black people. If they had put a monkey in a suit and made him talk like a black preacher and people had complained that they were trying to mimic Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton then I might buy that for a dollar.I thought that Woody Harrelson could save this movie because I like everything Woody Harrelson does. Woody Harrelson doesn't make bad movie choices. Maybe they paid him a boatload of money. Yeah, that's got to be it.The inclusion of the little white girl as a pet for the apes story arc is flawed and misguided, or as I like to think--just plain stupid. The apes kill her ""father"" or whoever the guy is that is caring for her and then she goes gallivanting off with the the apes like it is no big deal. The only way this makes sense is if the older man wasn't her father; but her kidnapper and abuser. Creepy.Even more creepy is when the big black Gorilla gets a crush on the little girl and puts a flower in her hair. I'm sorry; but that is what it looked like to me. One could extrapolate; but you don't really want to go there. When the big black ape gets killed the little girl is really, really, really sad and she puts a flower in his hair. She is more upset when the big black ape dies than she is when her father/kidnapper is killed. Creepy.When the apes first find the little girl she is sick; but apparently not sick enough to go on a cross country trek on horseback with strange apes. She is supposed to be sick with the virus (spoiler alert) which is why she cannot talk. But when you get sick with the virus it causes blood to pour out of your nose and mouth like Ebola and then you lose the ability to speak and then you die. The apes use a doll from the little girl to transmit the virus to the Woody Harrelson character.I could tell you more; but this review is already longer than any other review I have done. Let me recap this for you--silly, silly, silly.PS. The final battle scene is the silliest thing you have ever seen. All of Woody Harrelson's regiment are in one place. They could have been wiped out by one Apache helicopter standing off at a distance; but then there wouldn't be much fodder for a movie. Instead the helicopters make passes like an airplane and get shot down by RPGs. (Spoiler alert) After the other army smokes Woody's men and are celebrating they get wiped out by an avalanche. Oops, I just ruined the whole movie for you. Believe me, I did you a favor.",War for the Planet of the Apes
308,jrgibson-51931,Amazing - but not good,2,1 April 2020,"War for the Planet of the Apes has amazing make-up but is still boring and too long. Others her have identified the weak script and gaping plot holes so I won't repeat, except to add that a scenery chewing ape did not help me to enjoy the boredom..Before directing Citizen Kane, Orson Welles watched John Ford's 'Stagecoach' more than 30 times. Although both films are totally different, Welles learned camera angles, pacing, story-telling, etc and produced a masterpiece.The director of this film watched a bunch of classic films by John Sturges, David Lean, Francis Coppola and many others and then made this long, tedious, slow-moving epic that fails to totally engage it's audience. Matt Reeves managed to steal individual shots and scenes from his viewing marathon but proved that he is no David Lean when it comes to storytelling. Great films need more than make-up and CGI.However, expressive the apes may be or impressive the CGI, most people have to work harder to identify with an ape hero. Clearly heroic apes were intended as a left-wing allegory but creates a difficulty in generating sympathy for these alien creatures. Of course this narrative totally reverses the plot of the original extremely successful 1968 film but the idea of superior aliens ruling and overcoming humanity was irresistible to today's Hollywood.If the film had set out to be an action adventure with less pontificating, which is clearly what most viewers had hoped for, the result could have been two hours of good entertainment. The film's undoing is it's pretentious attempt at gravitas, which together with the obligatory preaching and ponderous pacing, has alienated many viewers.I enjoy long films, but they need great writing and film-making to keep the viewers engaged and not checking the time every five minutes. I suggest Matt Reeves buys a large box of popcorn and views, Lawrence of Arabia, Gone With The Wind. The Godfather, Barry Lyndon & 2001 A Space Odyssey before attempting his next epic - he may improve his film-making skills because sometimes less is more and tight editing improves pacing..I keep watching new films but am finally realizing the insanity of repeating an action and expecting a different outcome - every time it's the usual PC message, left-wing propaganda and lecturing which has become so irritating, especially when tacked on to the usual Hollywood garbage that passes for entertainment
today. I shall go and cleanse my brain with some Hitchcock, Ford, Welles or Kubrick and remind myself of the great film makers who are no longer with us.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Rather than a war it becomes a movie focused on a slave-master relationship. 2. Dumb villains. A part of the apes plan to escape was to make a patrol guard come into the prison cell so the monkeys could overpower him and steal his keys. How? Throw mud at him. He is stupid enough to open the cell filled with 200 monkeys and go in there ALONE to find out who did it. Are you serious??3. The little girl makes no sense. Her dad gets shot trying to protect her from monkeys. She didn't shed a tear. A monkey who she recently met and interacted with gets shot and she bursts into tears. 4.

310,templar77099,The Usual Blockbuster,6,10 February 2018,"Well, that was a bit of a letdown. It´s not a bad film by any means, but my whole perception of the trilogy is now not as untouchable as it was. I might have to rewatch ""Rise"" and ""Dawn"", but, apart from the effects and the performances, specially Andy Serkis - he really is out of this world - there's not much else to hold the film, that really suffers from a thin plot where many incongruences can be found. Its what you'd expect from a tentpole blockbuster but it can elevate itself beyond that so keep that in mind if you're gonna give it a watch.",War for the Planet of the Apes
311,cyguration,Andy Serkis Was Robbed...,8,8 April 2021,"...of an Academy Award.A lot of people felt Serkis should have won for his portrayal of Gollum, but he puts that performance to shame with his turn as the not-so-poker faced leader of the apes, Caesar.It's the understated emotion that really bubbles to the surface in Serkis' depiction of the reluctant but always resolute Caesar.It's not easy to give a performance through a CGI ape and convey to the audience through vocal intonations and an extremely limited speaking script the hurt, the ambition, the hate, and the pain that Caesar feels, yet paired with an incredibly talented special effects team, Serkis manages to pull it off.I suppose I can't give all the credit to them, because the script for this film is way above par. It works on so many different levels, and it's really quite something because I just got done watching Godzilla vs Kong, and oh boy is there such a stark difference in screenplay quality between the two films.All while watching War For The Planet of the Apes I was thinking to myself ""Why couldn't the Transformers get this sort of on-screen characterization and treatment?"" The Hollywood excuse is always ""No one wants to see robots fighting for two hours!"" and yet that's always the best and only parts worth watching when it comes to the Transformer films.Here, however, director Matt Reeves flipped the script (I suppose you could say literally) by putting the focus on the CGI apes instead of the humans. The entire story is about Caesar -- everyone else plays second fiddle to Caesar.It basically proves that you can make a quality, character-driven film without tacking on some ridiculous human sub-plots just to pad out the time or tie together action scenes.In this particular case War For The Planet Of The Apes is probably misnomer given that this is not an action film. Yes, there are action scenes, but this is all character drama, with a few action set pieces to payoff the trilogy.I thought the original Dawn of the Planet Of The Apes was an okay film, nothing too memorable. I didn't care all that much for Rise of the Planet of the Apes. However, I have to say that I adore War For The Planet Of The Apes.The difference boils down to bringing the emotion out of the leads (who are all CGI apes), giving the main antagonist a complex and multi-dimensional approach to his self-proclaimed ""purpose"" and a few twists you likely won't see coming.I can understand why a lot of people may not like the film because it's methodically filmed and paced. This isn't The Fast & The Furious, and if you go in expecting more ""War"" rather than ""Planet of the Apes"" then I suppose you'll be sorely disappointed.However, if you're looking for a movie that's actually really well directed, better written than it has any reason to be, and a lot more emotionally driven than most other Oscar-bait dramas, then you'll definitely enjoy War For The Planet Of The Apes.And it still irks me that Serkis wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his performance. I didn't bother checking to see who won best actor for 2017, but I'm finding it hard to believe anyone turned in a more layered, heartfelt, and multi-dimensional performance than Serkis did with Caesar.",War for the Planet of the Apes

314,rolandjordaan2,War for the Planet of the Apes - Spoiler Free Review,9,15 September 2018,"Having just watched this movie, I actually find it hard to think that this movie got released in 2017 as it feels like a film from a different era, a time when filmmakers did not rely solely on effects to get moviegoers into the cinema but actually put in effort to all the different aspects that used to make films great. 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a movie that simply does everything right, being part war film, part adventure film and even in part doing homage to classic Westerns, it balances all these different genres with exact precision. I guess I should take a moment here to say what I thought about the previous entries: 'Rise' I thought was a great film, strong plot, brilliantly acted, CGI was a bit iffy at times, but overall, loved it. 'Dawn' although by no means a terrible film I found strangely uninvolving and ultimately unmemorable. War fixes everything that was wrong with the previous films, the CGI is some of the best I have ever seen in a film, bringing life and emotion to these characters that you completely forget that they aren't real; the movie itself grips you from the very first scene and not for a single moment loses your interest. The acting here is top notch, not only from the main characters but from the smaller parts as well, we feel for the apes, we feel for the humans, soldiers caught up in a war they don't fully understand and we feel their fear as they fight this war. Important to note here: while the first two entries still focused mainly on the human characters, this movie is Caeser's story, he is in almost every scene and even though he is still a CGI character, the brilliance of his on screen presence along with Andy Serkis's voice work, brings a new depth to this character that we never got to see in the previous films. Woody Harrelson, as well, gives a career defining performance, his character is what an antagonist should be: evil, terrifying, unpredictable and most importantly, at all times convinced that the path he chose was the right one. This character is irredeemable and Woody Harrelson sells it every step of the way. The film's tone is intense as hell, you're kept on the edge of your seat, not knowing what's going to happen or who's going to die next and every time somebody does, you feel that death scene. Not a single character's death is simply glanced over, each one is handled with the class of an art film and they give both the characters and the audience time to let it sink in and for them to truly feel the loss. The lighting, especially when Woody Harrelson is on screen, adds a touch of great symbolism to the film, taking hints from techniques that were most commonly used by filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock. The other symbolism, although pretty obvious, really does work here and the social commentary remains strong, without becoming preachy. There are some nods made to the original 'Planet of the Apes' series that I thought were quite clever, and never reaches the point of shoving it in your face like was the case with 'Rise' and the ""Damn dirty ape"" line. 
Overall I truly recommend this film, don't wait for it to come to the small screen, go see it in the theatre, I'm definitely going to go see it again, so please go out and show your appreciation for film making at its very finest.",War for the Planet of the Apes

This Third entry for me, is the least of the series, however that said it is still a worthwhile and good entry in the series.Film starts strongly and goes along fine until about the half way mark, then gets bogged down and comes to almost a dead stop and at times becomes reminiscent of a "" Escape From a P.O.W Camp"" drama.Then it picks up again and redeems itself with a climax that throws up two twists that i never saw coming,one of which packs an emotional wallop.Lots of film references are there, including a couple of nods to the original series of films which i thought was a nice touch.Two good performances from of course, Andy Serkis and Woody Harrelson.

Acceptable and in some sequences admirable directing-editing choices, accompanied by above solid cinematography, with amazing sets and balanced colors. The visual effects were (naturally for the trilogy) stunning, yet even here they outdid themselves, with probably some of the best explosions we've seen on screen. Honorable mention is the script of the movie. Despite the fact that the military stuff was obviously overlooked to let the rest of the movie flow, they succeeded in that goal, without getting the viewer disengaged. And for the best part, as dystopian movies go, War for the Planet of the Apes is clearly and overlooked one: won't go over spoilers here, i'll just say it presents some successfully blurred lines between right and wrong, making you wonder what the ""good ending"" should be.

319,reid-hawk,Above average but definitely not the send off this franchise was going for,5,2 August 2017,"(This is going to be a short little review and nothing too in depth) First off I'll say that I enjoyed this movie, or at least certain bits and pieces of it. The open action sequence is downright incredible and the ending battle is not too bad either. However the middle section of this movie can be downright dreadful. The trailers, marketing, and title for this movie have altogether been very misleading. There really is no 'war' in this movie. The Apes never have a big battle with the humans or anything of the sort. Instead they are sent to a concentration camp and escape from it. If you were expecting lots of action you wont be in luck here. The action is very sparse for a nearly 2 and a half hour film. The pacing for most of it is actually terrible, and I even found myself bored a few times throughout the middle of the film. The army of ""special forces soldiers"" in opposition to the apes is downright autistic. They literally let a girl walk right through the door into their base completely unseen even though they are literally at war with another group of humans. They also completely fail to notice the apes escaping and they never really notice that they are gone. On top of this, their base was somehow built over like a foot of snow that somehow never collapsed in even though the apes literally dig through it in like 20 seconds. Woody Harrelson's character, who is simply called 'The Colonel"" was a pretty decent (if somewhat by the numbers) villain that was only made interesting due to Woody's pretty fantastic performance. Unfortunately pretty much every other human actor in this movie is completely terrible and most characters in this movie are just stupid in general, like the soldier who locks himself in with all the apes to try and pick a fight instead of just shooting them from his watch tower.The motion capture work in this film is also incredible. Like ""Dawn"" it can truly feel like you are watching real apes on screens and not actors in motion-capture suits. There is a much needed comic relief character named ""Badape"" who is introduced during the second act of the film who really breaks up the monotony that had begun to set in. The characters meeting and interacting with him is probably the only part of the middle section of this film I actually enjoy. I don't really hate any of it (except for the worst scene in the entire franchise. In it, an ape puts a flower in a little girl's hair that has been traveling with them to create some bullsh*t bond with her, only to get killed in the VERY NEXT SCENE. Like, they tried to create some sort of character for this ape who hadn't said a single word yet and relationship between him and the girl but they don't even give it an entire scene to develop before they kill him and expect the audience to care about his death. It's so cheesy combined with the fact that the girl breaks out crying when this ape dies even though she didn't even cry when this ape and Caesar literally SHOT AND KILLED HER REAL DAD!!!) but I don't really like any of it either. It's just so Uninterestingly and not even shot all that well either. Once they actually get to the Colonel's base and get captured the movie picks up somewhat, and while I don't like a lot of it, there are definitely more moments I like than dislike during this section of the film. The real saving grace of this movie overall, besides the few spectacular action scenes and amazing CG work is the score, which is downright fantastic for a clichéd big budget film like this one. Overall I don't hate this film as much as I might seem, I just think it's overlong and mismarketed. If anything this film should have been called ""Rise"" and the previous film should have instead been called ""war"".",War for the Planet of the Apes
320,travishouze,"Apes Together, Strong till the Very End",9,14 July 2017,"It's 2011. I saw a trailer for the film Rise of the Planet of the Apes during the midst of a reboot/remake's era, and I had zero interest in the film. After hearing the audience reaction, I found myself amazed with how much I ended up caring for Ceasar and the rest of the apes. The follow up Dawn... just brought me further into the apes society, and how not all apes turned the other cheek when it came to facing the humans. So I had a pretty high expectation for War for the Planet of the Apes to round out a strong trilogy.The film begins shortly after the events of the previous film as a Ceasar has to face the war humans set out against the apes after Koba, an ape who influenced other apes to kill countless humans as a form of retaliation. This slide of events leads to Ceasar having to face as a leader those close to him dying and being held in captivity by Woody Harrelson for a understandable motive that I won't spoil (just make sure you followed the first two films and this movies introductory text).Andy Serkis delivers a outstanding performance as Ceasar, who even through all the CGI and graphics, feels like a genuine leader conflicted within his position while protecting those who he is close to even if he has to break his code. Ceasar has to deal with apes of his own kind who sabotaged their fellow clan for the belief that humans may possibly give them mercy and not kill them. The emotional impact of this film is very strong and every death is felt and given ample time to feel the weight of death in the film. Woody Harrelson as The Colonel gives a surprisingly intimidating performance and is written with a clear motive, and at the same time makes you realize only a soulless man with nothing to lose would do what his character does.The film as well takes a lot of pages from concentration camps, slavery and hard labor when the apes are captured, but this when the film shines in its beliefs of ""Apes Together, Stong"" as there are times when even Ceasar's life is spared by the apes that aren't given as much time on screen. ""Bad Ape"" is one of the more interesting characters in the franchise as tonally he's a lot lighter in character and not dealing with the stakes as much as the others, however, he does give some much needed light moments, given the film can get very heavy to deal with at times.Just as a forewarning, I would highly suggest not to walk into this film with the expectation of this being a War movie despite the title. The action scenes aren't frequent in its 140+ minute runtime as the film is more focused on delivering effective character moments and dialogue.War for the Planet of the Apes is arguably the best of what's already been a extremely good trilogy. The cinematography is beautiful, the musical score is heart pounding, and gives characters understandable decisions. It won't be for everyone given a lot of the time is talking and moving from one place to the other, but i felt I was given a very moving blockbuster film that challenges a leaders faith through traumatic times.",War for the Planet of the Apes

322,rubya,It felt much MUCH longer than it was,4,23 October 2017,"I enjoyed the first two films of the latest Planet of the Apes 'series' so I went in thinking it was going to be good without reading any reviews first.It started well enough for a 'war' film but things just went downhill from there. The pace was too slow, the plot extremely weak, a lot of things didn't make sense. It felt like a 5 hour film and I have to admit I dozed off once I was so bored.As others have mentioned in their reviews, there's a girl who doesn't seem to care her dad was killed but cries when an ape she's known for like a day dies. A gorilla who in some scenes is about the same size as a chimpanzee and then riding a horse like it weighs nothing. Then you have a soldier camp manned by a bunch of amateurs who are of course all dressed in dark clothing because they're the bad guys, and get attacked by guys in white cameo who are obviously the good guys, it's not just for the snow, like it's Star Wars and we need the point to be spelled out. Missiles fly everywhere, hitting groups of soldiers rather than the massive fuel tank in the middle of the camp. Then the whole entire ""white"" army just runs up to the camp like storm troopers to conveniently get entirely buried by an avalanche. The end.This film is trying to explain things from the 1968 film but without any imagination. Why wouldn't Caesar try to work out why humans are going mute, could this be a tactical advantage? Rather than a war, with apes taking over humans, he seems to just want his apes to be left alone in a small area so how they end up ruling the planet, I don't know.I only gave 4 stars for the CGI.",War for the Planet of the Apes
323,roblesar99,A Thrilling End to a Great Trilogy,9,15 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes certainly does not fit the mold of the traditional summer tentpole, something which audiences might not have anticipated despite the action-packed trailers. The third entry in the rebooted Planet of the Apes series, and the second one directed by Matt Reeves, War is a bleak, intense tale directed with precise skill and carried by Andy Serkis' commanding performance as Caesar. Reeves' film takes place two years after the events of Dawn, finding Caesar fighting off attacks from a squadron of soldiers known as Alpha-Omegas led by a ruthless colonel played by Woody Harrelson, while simultaneously attempting to move his tribe to greener pastures. Ultimately, the colonel and Caesar are put on a collision course that could determine the future of both races.With War, Caesar completes his evolution from James Franco's pet project to full-blown military leader, and in a notable change from prior entries in the series, prefers speaking to signing as his method of communication. Reeves' film puts Caesar through the wringer, forcing him to face a gauntlet of challenges both physically and mentally. And Serkis responds by delivering a performance with such humanity, such raw primal emotion, that one completely forgets they're watching a creation borne out of a computer. Indeed, the power of the performance is magnified tenfold because Caesar isn't a human. If there were any justice in the world, Serkis would be up for a Best Actor Oscar next year. He's that good.Opposite Caesar as the film's primary antagonist is Woody Harrelson's colonel, who chews the scenery masterfully. The events of the last fifteen years have not been kind to the world, the colonel included. He doesn't receive much development beyond what's required to establish him as a threat to Caesar and his tribe's way of life, but it's not a necessity. Unlike the previous two films, which sometimes suffered when humans took control of the screen (more so Rise than Dawn), War's focus remains almost entirely on the apes, from series mainstays like the orangutan Maurice to newcomers like Steve Zahn's Bad Ape. The one notable human character apart from Harrelson is Amiah Miller's unnamed orphan, a kind soul who Maurice adopts as his daughter. Miller serves as a beacon of hope shining through the darkness. And make no mistake, this film is dark.The action, while breathtaking, does not shy away from death and destruction. Reeves stages his set pieces to show the bloody impact of this war and the carnage inflicted on both sides. As the tension mounts, the lives of characters always feel at risk. Michael Giacchino's thunderous score serves as the ideal complement, building on the musical cues and motifs of the previous entries to deliver one of the best blockbuster soundtracks in years. The themes that Reeves tackles also stray into dark territory, with the parallels to slavery made obvious as Harrelson's colonel and his captured apes represent the slave master and his slaves. While Reeves and his co-writer Mark Bomback don't make an aggressive effort to expand on said theme, they don't need to. The majority of the audience already grasps the evils of slavery and the imagery on display sufficiently serves its purpose - to further reinforce the immorality of the practice. War, for all of its biblical and film epic influences, very much feels like a film rooted in today's turbulent political climate. There's no shortage of moral dilemmas faced by both the humans and the apes.Reeves makes the most of his second film with these characters, but if there's one flaw that War possesses, it lies in his screenplay. Reeves and Bomback, having taken over for entirely from Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa, who wrote Rise and co-wrote Dawn with Bomback. While Reeves and Bomback do a mostly commendable job of wrapping up the so- called Caesar trilogy while still leaving room for a possible continuation of the story, the third act falters ever so slightly because of some minor plot conveniences. While they don't affect the quality of the story all that much, these elements feel just a bit too tidy, especially when compared to some of the bold storytelling choices in the film's opening act.But even these minor flaws can be overlooked - in large part because of Weta Digital's jaw-dropping special effects. Having worked on the series since Rise, Weta has only elevated the bar with their work on this latest installment. Every ape feels genuine, far more than just a collection of pixels from a computer program. Of course, it helps that the apes are all portrayed by incredibly talented motion-capture performers, but it doesn't change the fact that very few digital creations have ever felt this lifelike. The Academy might as well give War the Best Visual Effects Oscar now. Cinematographer Michael Seresin should also be in consideration for at least a nomination. His sweeping camera-work magnificently captures the world that Reeves has crafted, from the bitter cold of an abandoned ski resort to the cavernous refuge that Caesar calls home.Overall, War for the Planet of the Apes concludes one of the best science-fiction trilogies ever in stunning fashion. Featuring an Oscar-worthy performance by Serkis, incredible visual effects, and superb technical work, the film delivers the requisite ingredients for a strong film. But by expanding on the themes of its predecessors and concluding Caesar's story on an emotionally resonant and mature note, Reeves elevates the film to the next level. War proves that there are still plenty of stories left to tell in this world.Rating: 9/10 (Amazing)",War for the Planet of the Apes
324,lindee,worth watching,8,19 December 2017,"I have enjoyed the Planet of the apes saga, and look forward to getting the box set, the performances from all involved are brilliant, the special effect are sublime, to the fact everything looks real.
I have seen the film now and I wouldn't be bothered if I ever see, unlike the first outing which if it came on TV I would make a point of seeing again.
but as I said I enjoyed the journey with Caesar (Andy Serkis).from him being adopted, escaping from the ape sanctuary.
Steve Zahn as bad ape was endearing and gave a little comedy to the film, and a great platform for Amiah Miller I think we will being seeing her again in future projects.
Woody Harrelson, as proved over and over again he can take on any part serious or comedy as he made you hate him and wanting all the Apes to take their revenge",War for the Planet of the Apes
325,metztex,Started out well then crashed and burned,1,6 August 2019,"Spoilers are significant.This film started out rather good until the director/writer's constant drum beat of ""bad humans"" and far more sexist ""bad male humans"" really started to get to me. Before I get into that, let me talk about what is good with this film.CGI and cinematography are rather good in this one. Well shot and thought out. The changes in climate and weather was also a nice touch. Battle scenes were well done as well. Unfortunately this is where the good ends.Now the bad...At no time in this movie are humans portrayed as having any redeeming value. The drum beat here, all humans are blind killers. Every male character is pretty much shown to be racist killers and will kill anything that is not human. Even when an unseen human force is sent to destroy the truly evil primary antagonist in this film, the victorious ""good humans"" are still shown to rather kill anything that is not human and let it live. In fact, in the end, ALL MALE HUMANS are killed in this movie. I did not see a single one survive. The only human survivor was a young girl that appeared to be afflicted by a disease or something. I guess the message here is, human women are superior if they ""devolve"" to where they can't talk. This seems like a huge paradox but that is the way it worked. When you look at this film at this basic level, it make you really wonder, what was the director thinking?I can't understand why so many did not see this in their reviews. Does not make sense. I'm and glad I rented this film rather than went to the theater. Even then, to me it was not even worth the dollar I spent on it.I personally am getting tired of the constant drum beat coming out of Hollywood that men are evil and in the worst cases like this film, basically all humans are evil and deserve to be killed. If you take a look at this movie closely, you will see that.Considering all the problems and division that is occurring in our society and the hurtful rhetoric coming from both the left and the right, this type of movie has no place in our society right now. Some would call the move subliminal hate speech. While I don't, I know some people that would.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Confusion because critics are quoting this as the best trilogy, even comparing it to classics like LOTR and Return of the Jedi!!! And frustration because I was expecting this movie to be as good as, if not better than Dawn. But this movie was boring as hell, I really wanted to walk out of the cinema (this rarely happens, I even sat through the entire speed racer and Jupiter Ascending movies!!) Caesar was a very charismatic character in cinema. He was strong, clever and led a whole pack of followers, battling the odds and surviving. Say good-bye to all of that, because in this film, all he does is stares infinitely at the camera conveying best emotions ever to be captured via motion capture and that's all. His side-kicks and the little girl contribute more to the plot than Caesar.And the ""war"".. I was waiting for the ultimate showdown and I still am waiting. The war is between two clashing armies of human solders and not apes. All these clever apes do is escape sneakingly like any normal apes would do if you leave the cage unlocked at a zoo. And this is the film which critics are going ga-ga over!! OMG!! What happened to you guys! Guys, trust all the 1 star reviewers here this time and skip this one altogether! Its better to think that the New Planet Of Apes series in only Part-Deux and pretend that the third one doesn't exist altogether. This is coming from someone who liked both the first 2 films (second one, a little more) The CGI, motion-capture and product values are second to none, but didn't the first two films already prove that!! And comparing this to Return of the King or the Jedi!! A better comparison will to be compare the whole film to Jar-Jar Binks!!",War for the Planet of the Apes

The important thing is yes, this movie really is that bad. By now we are all used to the fake reviews on IMDb that accompany any movie on its opening weekend.

If I had to choose one and only one adjective, it would be maudlin.I would have walked out of this movie if I didn't bring four kids with me.

This is the case of the good ol bait n switch. The marketing led us to believe it would be a huge war movie. This couldn't have been further from that. There was a bit of war thrown in - but not to do with the apes!! The director had something else in mind. He wanted to create a film that was mostly emotionally driven and a mix of the great escape, escape from sobibor (escape from detention center - a la WWII).I was baffled! this had to be the worst of the franchise.

The ending is reminiscent of Moses crossing the Red Sea.Idle thought while waiting for something to happen in the movie - the apes are nowhere near anatomically correct.

It has the same heart and soul and intelligence as the first two. Mr. Gerkis does another masterful turn portraying Caeser, the ape who is more ""human"" than the humans who are all trying to exterminate him. Woody Harrelson is also a good choice as the mad colonel. I especially enjoyed the early scenes, which were shot amidst towering waterfalls and dark caves, as the humans tried to flush out the apes in their woods.

Way more plot holes than Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The cinematography was very mediocre. It's the same bland, darkly lit look from the previous Dawn of the Planet of the Apes film. Camera placement wasn't very good and it had no use of the quadrant system when it came to framing either. The CGI is probably the best it's ever been, but it's nothing special. It's just a bunch of talking apes riding horses and shooting machine guns with one arm. The direction had no style, it had weak action sequences that were very stupid with very little inventive camera work. The OST composed by Michael Giacchino might be one of the most laziest OST I have ever heard. It tries to be deep and biblical, but it just ends up being laughable. This is one of the worst films of the year and probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. Highly overrated.0/10.",War for the Planet of the Apes
333,haristas,"WAR, what is it good for?",7,18 September 2017,"The original 1968 PLANET OF THE APES is my all-time favorite movie. I first saw it when I was almost nine years old back when it came out. My several IMDb reviews of it often appear on its page.But, I've not bothered commenting on the rebooted APES franchise until now. The reason I'm doing so is because of the amount of hate and negative reviews this movie is getting on this site, which I think is way over the top and quite addle-brained.First off, I for one do accept this ""Ceasar Trilogy"" of movies as prequels to the classic 1968 original. They don't match with the continuity of the original, now almost fifty years old, but there's nothing that says they have to. Forgetting some of the absurdities of the Charlton Heston movie, such as his nearly fast-as-light-speed interstellar flight having taken off in 1972(?) on a mission to supposedly colonize another Earth-like world with only one female crew member(???), these so-called ""reboots"" have offered a much more clever and plausible -- though still highly improbable -- explanation of how the planet of the apes could come into being than either the original five-film series of old did, or even Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel. RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES as pure Science Fiction is better than the 1968 film, though that's not to say that RISE is a better overall movie than the '68 now classic film.So, how do these rebooted films fit as prequels to the '68 original? I think of them as the very beginning of the original, or origin, time-line that leads to the world of 3978 AD Earth that Charlton Heston's spaceship crash-lands on. A lot of viewers don't seem to realize that the events of the three reboot APES movies only get us around thirty years into the future. That still leaves nearly two thousand years before the events of the original film, and a hell of a lot of time for Fox to fill up with future APES movies if they choose to. (They only thing I'm still puzzled by is when is the nuclear holocaust supposed to happen, or have the makers of these reboots abandoned that scenario and will offer a different explanation for that desert planet of 3978 came into being? I think we're supposed to accept now that the sequels to the '68 original never happened, and that Heston's Taylor character was wrong when he assumed a nuclear war destroyed mankind at the famous conclusion to the original.) Still, I have found these rebooted APES films to be an exercise in frustration mostly because they're really not what the Planet of the Apes concept is about, what its purpose is, or what makes it important. Yes, they are allegorical, have social commentary, and a certain satirical content, but it's nowhere near as pointed and relevant as it was in the original (as heavy-handed as it often is), and that's where these new APES movies fail for me -- there's just not enough to them. The makers have either forgotten or are simply ignoring the fact that the original movie wasn't about a planet of apes, it was about what happens to one misanthropic astronaut on a planet of apes. It was a black comedy and a biting commentary on the arrogance and stupidity of humanity either believing or just assuming that it is the ""apex"" of animals. These new films do deal with that, but it's all secondary to what I see as just ""simian soap opera,"" and it often comes across as more than a little silly. Still, I find them to be better than average for what passes these days as summer blockbusters.However, the level and character of attack WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES has been getting in reviews here is making poop-flinging monkeys out of those writing them. WAR and the entire trilogy is not about current liberal vs. conservative politics in the U.S., nor the situation in Europe and problems with refugees, or a commentary on Black Lives Matter. Sure, there's some kind of subtext going on, but for me, it's far too buried and muddy to get excited about. It's just adventures among the monkeys, folks.Ironically, though, I think it's being hated because it's not a dumber movie, that being a movie that's little more than what its title says it's supposed to be about -- War. So, it turns out not to be just another summer ""action"" movie, wall-to-wall action, that is, like the Fast and Furious franchise and other models of cinema greatness. Well, that's too bad, but to complain about at the level that's been expressed here is to come across as cinema brats. You were bored. Oh, what an artistic crime this movie committed! You guys need to just go back to waiting for the next Mad Max movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes
334,SBenoit5,All the good reviews are paid reviews,4,20 November 2018,"The story is so generic and absurd that it is hard to watch.The only good point why I gave four stars is the really high quality of the CGI. The team behind the CGI really worked hard and the results are fantastic.But my god, the script has been written by a ten year old kid. It is simply impossible to watch that movie seriously and at the end you stop and say: Wow, this is truly a masterpiece, the best one of the series! No no no, those are paid reviews.",War for the Planet of the Apes
335,MovieNinjaGuy,Very good but not a great end to a worthwhile trilogy reboot,7,28 July 2017,"First off I have to say War for the Planet of the Apes has some of the best ape effects, cgi and motion capture etc I have ever seen. The quality of the effects are easily on par with Avatar and really a step forward in movie effects I would say.From seeing some early ratings and reviews I was expecting this movie to be the best out of the 3 in the reboot Planet of the Apes trilogy and perhaps worthy of an 8 or 9 score but I cannot get over 7 myself.Sure all three are probably better than any of the sequels that came after the 1968 classic but I feel this (I hope) final film of the reboot trilogy falls somewhat short. I would say the second in the trilogy is the best and this one is more on par with Rise.The best part of War for the Planet of the apes was the beginning. Seeing the humans trying to attack the ape camp and failing was very well done and had some of most exciting parts. In a sense it is the only proper part that could be considered a ""war"" between humans and apes. Beyond this, the story gets a bit clumsy it seems and it is constantly battling to get to an interesting resolution. The movie never reached that feeling of epic-ness that previous movies in the series had. The scale of what was going on seemed more localised to one event rather than having an impact on the entire ""planet"". Sure some explanation of the virus supposedly deals with that. But it seems all very clumsy these explanations by the colonel etc. Visually and storywise The movie misses a big twist or so (such as on the level of Charlton Heston seeing the Statue of Liberty etc) but perhaps we have had so many planet of the apes twists before maybe there is nothing left to think of. It felt a little long drawn out, building up to something that never really happened.The enslavement of the apes, getting them to build a wall, not been given food or water all seemed a bit more of a human critique rather than a good idea for a movie.Furthermore in War there seemed to be many throwaway events that didn't seem worthwhile. What was the point in the tunnels flooding and Maurice closing a door? I thought surely this would be revisited later. Perhaps the human soldiers would go after the apes in the tunnels and then would drown as the door would be opened by mistake. The avalanche seemed a bit of a simple dumb idea to deal with the reason why apes can survive what ""the planet"" throws at life over the humans. Did all the human soldiers die? Meh.There simply wasn't any particular story point that was revisited later and made you think ""Ah that's what is going on, or that is the reason why we saw that before, or that is a nice revisit/touch"" etc. I usually like those kind of twists/story points. Such as in Back to the future Doc Brown indeed reading Marty's letter and thus preventing his own death or using the original T Rex from Jurassic Park in Jurassic World to save the day. The movie really could a have done with a bit more clever whit to tie things together and make plot points seem worthwhile and conclude them later on.The movie never deals with questions such as where any human non soldiers are and if indeed they are all infected and thus if they then I guess all end up mute as we see in the 1968 movie. Surely a better reason for the muteness would have been to explain this because the apes taking over simply leads to less social cohesion of mankind, as they are living in hiding and thus less education/handing down less intelligence to next generations or so. The fact that Ceasar (the best English speaking ape) dies and the apes all end up living in a secluded area away from humans doesn't really explain why apes would adopt the English language so well from there on. The movie probably tries to explain this through the Bad Ape story but this seems quite dissatisfying to me, or perhaps a fourth or even fifth movie in this series would explain this?However, I hope War is the last in the series. If there is one more movie to tie this series to the 1968 film it surely would make this particular entry even less worthwhile story wise.Although this trilogy was very good and very worthwhile I still think the problems with writing prequels eventually shine through and more so here than in Rise and Dawn. The only really, really great prequel I have ever seen that really makes sense within an original story is Rogue One. I think prequels remain mostly a bad idea for movies or TV shows. I mostly want to see what happens next. What happened before I guess I don't care about so much. And if I do watch prequels, I hardly ever feel completely satisfied with how previous events are explained.",War for the Planet of the Apes
336,rs403404,Amazing,10,29 July 2017,"Remember when prequels were all the fad. ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" was the first one to make a real impact. Since then we've had prequels to ""The Exorcist"", ""Alien"", ""X-Men"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Wizard of Oz"", ""The Thing"", and even ""Dumb and Dumber"". Some are good, some not so much. However, they rarely outshine the original films that inspired them.That's where ""Planet of the Apes"" stands alone. Not only is the prequel trilogy a collection of three outstanding movies. They are also without a doubt the three best movies of the franchise. Further, ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (yes, this trilogy is plagued with clumsy titles) might be the best of the bunch.""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" focuses largely on the human characters while ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" seemed to share screen time equally between human and apes characters. In ""War for the Planet of the Apes"", the apes are very much the center of the story. Not all the apes can speak yet, so much of this plays almost like a multimillion dollar silent movie. Yet, at no point does the story ever feel like it's missing something. I have no idea what the budget of this film was, but the apes that are nearly omnipresent for the 140 minutes screen time look completely real.So far, all I've done is praise technical achievements. The story here is simple, Caesar (Andy Serkis) wants peace for the apes and wants to end the bloodshed between humans and apes. However, when a human Colonel (Woody Harrelson) attacks Caesar's family Caesar pursues the path of revenge and follows the footsteps of Koba (Toby Kebbell) from the previous movie. Despite the War in the title, this is all a very personal tale for Caesar and how his plight tells us if the apes are worthy of survival. In contrast we have the Colonel, whose plight is just as personal. Despite the fact that the Colonel is played very much as a villain, his reasons seem almost logical. He's fighting not just against the apes, but against fate. A fight he will do anything to win and his path will determine whether humanity is worthy of survival.To say more would be to reveal too much and rob you of the experience of this movie. Because that's what this movie is, an experience that's meant to be seen not read. Needless to say the performances and the direction by Matt Reaves are all phenomenal here. This is probably one of the best trilogies ever and ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is one of the best movies of the year.",War for the Planet of the Apes
337,reoroy,War of the Worlds,9,14 July 2017,"After watching War for the Planet of the Apes, I feel sorry for two entities.(1) I feel sorry for Caesar. He never started the war. The bad ape Koba started the war. Caesar got embroiled in it. The character development of Caesar in this rebooted Planet of the Apes franchise is so amazing.(2) I feel sorry for Andy Serkis. This guy has said in certain interviews that because of all the ""digital make-up"" he wears, the awards ceremony juries overlook his acting capabilities and don't generally consider his performances to be worthy of awards. While there is no doubt that all the CG involved to make Caesar look so real is outstanding, Caesar wouldn't have been Caesar if Andy Serkis had not breathed in the kind of emotional complexity necessary for making an ape encounter the physical and mental challenges of life with such aplomb. Listen out BAFTA, Golden Globes and The Academy. Consider this man for some of your awards this coming awards season.The third film in this franchise is terrific to say the least. I'd highly recommend all humans and all apes to see this film at least once if not more.",War for the Planet of the Apes
338,darryl-42069,"More ""heart"" than ""war""",9,30 July 2017,"When you hear the title: ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (focus on the ""War""), you may expect big fight scenes, destruction, lots of guns, and ""ala-Michael-Bay"" explosions. Well, this is absolutely not the movie for you.Sure, this movie had them, but there's more ""heart"" than ""war"", and this is a good thing.Andy Serkis once again nailed the role of Caesar. This is probably the best performance of his career. Woody Harrelson is amazing as the Colonel. He has a deep backstory that makes him relatable. Karin Konoval is great as Maurice. Amiah Miller as the mute Nova is, surprisingly great. She's probably one of the best child actors working right now, alongside Dafne Keen in Logan.The story is definitely Oscar material. The story takes focus not on the ""war"", but the ""heart"". The movie takes a lot of time to build character, to makes us care about them, so that when a character dies, you care and feel the sadness because the movie takes time to build it. The ""war"" aspect, the action scenes were just the icing on the cake, and that makes the movie much more entertaining. The story telling is also Oscar worthy, as the story was told by the character's actions, not by the character's explanations. The cinematography is also top notch. The action scenes, though not as exiting as Dawn, were also well executed. The CGI is amazing. Everything looks convincing and real. The score is very haunting, and one of Michael Giacchino's best works. And the ending is one of the greatest endings in recent memory, what a perfect ending.The movie has, virtually no flaws at all (although it has a few ""very"" minor plot holes), so the fact that there's a lot of 1 star rating in the first 3 pages of IMDb is mind- boggling. Are they drunk? Are they really watching the movie I saw? Or are they the fans of The Emoji Movie? Pretty sure all of the negative reviews got fallen asleep during the movie. This is actually not a war movie, this is more of a drama. If you watched Dawn you should already know what you'll get. The title does slightly misleading, but I don't care, this is a really good conclusion to the Apes trilogy (though I haven't watched Rise, i thinking to watch it later) Does it deserve a new installment? No, the movie ends perfectly. It was meant to end the series so 20th Century Fox, you better respect that decision, but prequel or a side story in the trilogy might do. Now that Matt will work on Batman, I hope that he'll bring his magic from Apes to Batman.Final Score: 9/10, for amazingly deep story, action scenes, more human story than war story, and realism",War for the Planet of the Apes
339,branflakes4547,Damn near perfect movie.,9,28 May 2019,This is such an excellent movie and a perfect capper to the trilogy. In terms of summer blockbusters it is nearly perfect save for Wopdy Harrelson phoning it in the entire time. The ending and buildup and cinematography and acting and production quality are all top notch. Nearly incredible I would recommend this movie and trilogy to anybody. I don't know why these movies don't get more praise. Perhaps they are overlooked as action schlock- because there's apes using guns riding horses and driving tanks. But do you really need a high brow planet of the apes movie in 2019? I still think about the ending to this movie quite frequently as it really stuck with me. Go rent this trilogy and start from the beginning (the 2011 film with James Franco) they get better with each one and this one is one of the best summer blockbusters in recent memory (except for Mad Max of course),War for the Planet of the Apes
340,NormanCroucher,Those damn dirty apes have pulled off a great trilogy,7,9 October 2017,"The new 'Planet of the Apes' franchise has been an unexpected and surprising success, easily equaling the quality of its iconic ancestral lineage, or even arguably surpassing it. 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' was always going to be a tough act to follow but thankfully 'War' bucks the trilogy trend of the third film often being a lesser installment. It's not as well executed or as well structured as 'Dawn', but it's an excellent film nonetheless and builds upon an already rich mythology that offers up an elaborate explanation as to how Charlton Heston came back from space to find himself on a damn monkey planet.Matt Reeves returns for directing duties and recaptures the same foreboding and tension he evoked the last time around. This is a very downbeat and bleak movie, so much so I actually had to remind myself that this is a summer blockbuster produced and released by 20th Century Fox. It's incredible to think that something as dark as this can still sneak under the wire and into the mainstream, and we should all be thankful of that fact. Andy Serkis has graduated across the series from being the plot device of 'Rise', to the dual protagonist of 'Dawn', to the full-on lead character of 'War', and his motion captured performance is truly remarkable. You can even tell it's his face at certain points - a sneer here, a frown there - and I fully believe this performance should qualify him for an Academy Award nomination for Lead Actor. He's the crown jewel of this franchise and he leads the charge from beginning to end this time around. I also have to make room for Steve Zahn's performance as a newly introduced ape, who is about the closest thing to a comic relief this film gets and his comic timing and tender eccentricity allows some breathing room between all the doom and gloom. The crowning achievement of this trilogy is its ability to seamlessly blend technological craft with human artistry. I have always favoured practical effects over CGI, but my god, even I can't deny just how magnificent the visual effects are. This is as close to photo- real you will see.The title of the film is somewhat of a mislead since it's a much smaller and more intimate story this time around, and I feel there was more of an epic war taking place in 'Dawn'. This is much more of a revenge tale, framed through the eyes of our protagonist Caesar, who we have seen grow up and mature into a leader across the two previous films, which lends a greater sense of dimension and complexity to his character. Watching him and his clan strike back against the remnants of the human race becomes an interesting exercise for us. As human beings we are naturally predisposed to the survival of our species, even in fiction, and usually films set in a post-apocalyptic world tend to lean heavily towards that as the goal. The 'Apes' films ask us to do something else - they ask us to root AGAINST the human race, and that does create a conflict within us as viewers. Not all humans are bad, and we know where this story is taking us once you factor in 'Planet of the Apes' 1968, yet at the same time these apes are every bit as complex and fallible and heroic and dangerous as we are. They have an equal right to live and build a future together. And while this film definitely comes down on the side of the apes, unlike 'Dawn' which showed the failings of both sides to make peace, it is a strange experience rooting for them to win this time around since there are no real human allies like James Franco or Jason Clarke's characters. In any other film, the apes would be the villains and Woody Harrelson's Colonel character makes a good case as to why he sees it that way, even though the filmmakers jettison his humanity in order to paint him as a more out-and-out villain. After all, we, the audience, have to be on side come the finale, especially come the arrival of an unexpected deus ex machina.This has been an intelligent and emotionally and morally complex series of films that have raised interesting questions about animal rights, speciesism, societal hierarchies, leadership and subservience, communication, conflict and peace. They are not simply mindless sci- fi movies cashing in on an existing property. Both of the previous films have been deeply thoughtful explorations of those aforementioned themes and ideas. So I am very pleased to report that 'War for the Planet of the Apes' proudly carries that torch all the way through to its beautifully biblical final moments.",War for the Planet of the Apes

343,larrymeers,Don't understand all the hate.,10,17 July 2017,"Before i saw this movie i looked at some people's opinions about it and i saw mostly negative reviews, so i was really nervous going into this movie thinking that i would have had the same reaction to it and seriously i have no idea what those people are talking about. So War for the planet of the apes is the 3rd film in the new prequel/Reboot of the planet of the apes movies. And this is about Caeser going on a journey to stop a war between his apes and an army of highly trained soldiers, while he also tries to control his more violent instincts. First the obvious, the CGI is amazing and is truly a technological marvel to cinema. Andy Serkis once again plays the ape ruler Caesar and is easily the best movie character in recent years, in each film he has gotten progressively better and in this one it is definitely the best performance. The story is great and is well acted throughout. This movie is also an amazing drama. There are a lot of moments that just make you jerk a tear every once in a while and its believable. The action sequences are pretty good too. Woody Harrelson plays the colonel and he does a pretty good job at it (He is not as good as koba but still good). He is just a character that you can relate to and you understand why he is doing all of this. Caesar and the colonel are pretty relatable. As much as i would love to say how great this movie is, i better stop right here. I loved every part of this movie and i did not find anything i did not like about it, but i am gonna talk about why i think most people were disappointed with this film. So if you watched all the trailers and looked at the title you may be expecting one thing, a ton of apes and humans fighting with guns and rockets. But although there is some of that in this movie, its definitely not the main point of it. This movie to its core is about the war that a person faces emotionally while war is happening around him. We see this concept with Caesar all the way through the movie. It also talks about what terrible things a person or people would do in a war. Woody Harrelson's character does what he does because he believes that the entire human race is going to go extinct if he does not act. I mean, would you do that if you knew that you could slowly be replaced by another species? So some people do not like this film because they were expecting a full on hardcore war movie. And it is that, but it really is a commentary about how a person has a war within themselves when war is happening around them. And people either missed, did not care, or did not understand the more darker themes about this movie. But anyway, in the end i thought this movie was a masterpiece in every way it could have been. It has amazing CGI, performances, action sequences, dark themes, tear jerking moments, and a beautiful moral to it. A+ or 10/10 APES TOGETHER STRONG!",War for the Planet of the Apes
344,gonzallanca,Amazing Finale,9,23 July 2017,"War of the planets of the apesDawn of the Planet of the Apes, that Koba began the war between humans and apes, what remains of the army send a colonel (Woody Harrelson) to destroy everything that Caesar Andy Serkis).Let's start with the actors. The effects today are fantastic, since the first movie (Rise of the planet of the apes, 2011) we have seen, and have improved over the years. I do not know if it's the effects or that Andy Serkis acts too well, it's really fantastic ... And besides I like the development of the character, throughout this trilogy, you can give many examples of the decisions that the character takes or how Behaves has what is happening, what happened or what is going to happen. Woody Harrelson is the best of the movie. His performance is impressive. The ideals of the character are sane ... and to see no, depends on the viewer (I am in an average opinion).It is the end of one era, and the beginning of another. At the end of the movie the nexus is made with the 1968 film, which I canceled because I thought it was a reboot, but no, it's a Prequel.The direction of this film is impeccable, I find that Matt Reeves is a genius. Since I saw his work in the previous movie (Dawn of the planet of the apes) I fell in love with this director, and this is the same case, even better. Thanks to the nostalgia factor, this director can expand much more and generate something beautiful.9/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
345,ssunny-social,A Culmination of Various Pop-Culture Extractions,8,26 February 2018,"The film takes colours from different films, mythologies and history. The film starts with, showing how a few apes have already sided with the humans losing all hopes of winning a war against their modern weaponry. Caesar tries to keep it calm until a betrayal begins a chain of events that leads to having his family killed. The whole 140 minutes relies on Caesar's journey to Colonel to avenge his family, their capture and a war that eventually makes the earth a planet of apes.
The realism carried in the character sketch of the ideal leader Caesar, his slogan, his war keeping up the moral integrity at the same time carrying an emotionally deep understanding to his motivation is a straight reminiscent of Moses leading Israelites to freedom from slavery. Woody's character as the colonel with a cheeky maniacal fashioned avatar talking with convincing statements on his actions reminds you of the Brando's much more demonic and psychotic Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, though even Woody owns the part with an interesting individualism. The final third of the film takes many cues from the Great Escape when the captive Apes plan an escape. This part uses lighter-mood background score even with the extreme tension of the situation giving us some subtle humour along the way.The film doesn't always push itself to be fast, but does it with enough zest keeping you engrossed throughout. It likes to have conversations and generate details not found in other summer entertainers. The credibility is so evident that you stop seeing them as apes but as probably less privileged humans who have not had equal rights even with their growing intelligence almost posing a threat to humans. Its, only in the end you realize how you have supported the apes in winning the war killing all the humans but you still can't help but rejoice in the destruction of mankind, if that is not direction then what is?",War for the Planet of the Apes
346,Danielpotato,Lacks something to be great.,6,9 October 2017,"The original Planet of the Apes was a great movie, with great acting, but it was its end that was in everyone's memory. It was something not expected by the audience that saw the movie for the first time.War for the Planet of the Apes, is a well-produced film with good production values, which shows well where the budget went. The direction is good, but not spectacular. Cinematography is attractive and competent, but nothing too much. The acting is good, but like the other departments, it's no big deal. The ending is good, but nothing much to be remembered, unlike as it was in the original. This is the big problem with this movie. It is well executed, but it lacked a bit of daring, something out of the ordinary, something that stays in memory of the people who have just seen this movie. What is common in modern movies, the new films leaves no room for imagination, everything here is explained, as if it were an equation, sometimes movies directors need to go beyond that, to get better results and be reminded. War for the Planet of the Apes is a film to be seen from time to time, however the lack of something greater prevents him from being seen more often. It's the typical movie, when I've seen something better, but I want to see something just to pass the time without being offended by the movie. For this type of thinking, War for the Planet of the Apes is the ideal to be seen.",War for the Planet of the Apes

350,tymbus,Bore of the Planet of the Apes,4,16 July 2017,"I have never felt so out of step with popular critical opinion, but I found War for the Planet of the Apes dreary to say the least. If you are going to call a film "" War for.."" then It is best to actually stage a war rather than a battle for sympathy. As much Disney's Incredible Journey as anything else, WFTPA follows a group of apes led by Caesar in a mission to scout out an advancing army of humans only to find the rest of their ape kind have already been captured in a battle that we don't get to see. A poster showing apes charging towards troops in bogus Barnum and Bailey hucksterism ie a lie.All the positive reviews have focused on the pixelated puppetry of motion caption and the CGI rendering. Yes it is excellent...to an extent. I was totally convinced human actors bought these characters to life. The apes are so real that it just drew attention to the way the virus that give them intelligence also made them act out of character. Gorillas, for example, are not aggressive killers, orangutans aren't wise old men and where are the bonk crazy Bonobos? (They never get a look-in in the Apes movies - too busy shagging I guess)Woody Harrelson plays a psycho human supremacist fighting to eliminate a mutation in the virus that is making humans speechless. But, only minutes in to his performance, I realized that since Donald Trump's election, I was tired of watching aggressive, racist Americans. Harrelson's character is just another of the many clichés of which the film is entirely made.There are some very specific quibbles: the aged 'Bad Ape' isn't the comic relief the makers think. His back story is confused and his former home : a zoo, quarantine center, prison looks nothing like any of these. Since when were zoos just big cages? The concentration camp is strangely under populated with human guards and those that are there fail to spot hundreds of apes vanishing down all too conveniently already made escape tunnels. There's no emotional investment in the human vs human conflict and the climax (spoiler alert)in which everyone bar a few chimps is wiped out in an avalanche is unexpected and narratively ridiculous. It is as if the writer couldn't think how to resolve the established conflict. More to the point it undermines the mythic story arch - that's how most of humanity died? In snow? Perhaps the 'white out' was supposed to be satirical but it is unlikely. Even the building of a wall (to keep out humans) fails to resonate.So what we are left with is a human family revenge drama in ape form. Not even the nods to the original Apes movies raise this film beyond a character piece. Again this focus on family is incongruous. Chimpanzees in the wild are promiscuous. So not only have they developed the ability to speak and think, the Apes here have also mutated into middle class family units. And again, the reality of the rendering calls attention to the unreality of the fictional universe. In a way, the original prosthetics and performances were better because they called attention to the satirical intentions of many of the scripts (particularly Planet and Escape).Taken as a whole, this film is just dull. CGI rendering and motion caption may have progressed, but story telling remains in the past.",War for the Planet of the Apes

353,joecoby45,Drawn out and clichéd.,3,3 November 2017,This movie is a complete joke. The plot is tediously drawn out for almost 2 and a half hours with not much of anything significant happening. The movie is called War for the Planet of the Apes but no such thing happens. The apes are basically in the background for a war that's actually between humans. The fu*&*?!?!

354,johnmiasjo,Garbage lazy plot,1,25 April 2018,"I think the writers put this one together overnight in a rush after a bad hangover, the last two of the trilogy were great this one the writer laid down on the plot, it was slow in developing thru out the film some things did not make sense and overall poorly written.The movie was quiet boring easy to fall asleep during the movie very little to no action except some monkeys whispering most of the time, this movie did not make the apes smarter it made them dumber but the humans even dumber for not easily killing off the dumb apes, at this point roaches would have ruled the planet.Is a movie to watch if you have time to kill and want to nap while you watch the movie it will put you to sleep is super slow. There was no war but just squabble the leader of the humans is as dumb as a rock and is incredible Cesar does not get killed in captivity, basically it was lazy writing they put it together in a rush and said yeah let's go with this one, the only interesting character was the bad ape monkey, adopting the little girl had no value to the story at all and is creepy that she will live with a bunch of dirty monkeys and when she grows up might end up with one as a boyfriend, this is a D+ movie at best, the writers should get fired a movie with this budget to be so bad they milked the success of the last two movies.One thing is hard to understand is that humans have an organized army and technology like helicopters well dressed soldiers they seem well fed but dumb as a rock instead of trying to save the human race and fight the monkeys they fight each other and the monkeys, I see room for a 4th movie where monkeys actually take over the world not just a block, also is time for Cesar to move on he is too soft on killing and war, if you are going to fight the most dangerous animals on the planet humans you have to be stronger and Cesar is not, let's get a real mean monkey as a leader.The writers got really cheap on this movie and milked it and filled in the holes in order to give you a long boring movie, they did the same thing on Hangover 3 the the first two were great and they laid down on the third just like this movie they took alot of short cuts and got super cheap.",War for the Planet of the Apes

356,noirink-12054,Surprisingly good...,8,20 August 2017,"I seriously do not understand all the hate here. Yes, the movie had its flaws - but after all the superhero-nonsense I saw in the last couple of months I found it very daring. I enjoyed it big time. At least this movie tried to show emotional characters and it succeeded in my opinion. Certain moments in this film reminded me on films like Apocalypse Now and The Great Escape.Maybe some viewers could not get over it that this movie is about Apes and, yes, I was rooting for them - so was the audience with me in the cinema.The humans, what was left of them, where in fact the baddies... but in this movie, mankind is literally at its end, so why is it surprising that most of them are hostile towards the uprising apes? And I like to mention here that Woody Harrelson is doing a hell of Job as the villain here. I loved to hate him here!When I read the one star reviews here on IMDb, some of them describing this movie with words like Communistic Propaganda and Anti-Christian Bigotrie. Seriously? Are we still trapped in this kind mindset? It's a movie after all. Maybe we should really leave the planet to the apes. ;)If you are the kind of person who likes Movies with social critical undertones, anti-climatic pay offs and (obviuosly) Anti-War Messages - I dare to say; go watch it!",War for the Planet of the Apes

But knowing this movie is SO CGI-heavy gets you watching for the fails - and there are quite a few. Particularly when apes are getting off horses, jumping down with the physics of B-movie funding.Let's get this straight - there is no plot. You could write this story on the back of a postage stamp. The ""story"" fails at every turn to deliver anything remotely plausible. Why doesn't the Colonel waste Caesar at the first opportunity, knowing the threat he represents, instead of waxing lyrical? What's with the utterly implausible ""virus"" that stops humans from speaking? Why does that totally idiotic soldier who gets dung in his face, stomp down and lock himself INSIDE a pen full of rebellious apes? What's with the water in the tunnel, all of a sudden?

359,g_ryder,The circle has taken a full turn - Excellent symbolic art about the final downfall of humanity.,10,18 July 2017,"This is my interpretation of the symbolism in the movie and it's related significance to the first movie of 1968: The first movie brilliantly captures the underlying reality of that time and it's developing consequences and that is: the growing expectations from technology, the coming rise of Evolutionism, the failure of the 60's counterculture leading to the religion of Scientism and it's New Atheist literature, their Pundits projecting themselves as the final and total authority over all and everything, and finally the complete dominance of unchecked, unregulated Capitalism as the only economic model - all these were considered by the people all over the world as the New Gospel of Science that would be the basis for the Conquest of the Universe. So in 1968 this movie didn't make waves, and was mostly looked upon as ""cheesy"" entertainment, and not as a work of Art, especially the kind of Art that serves as an early warning signal or omen of things to come. But that is exactly what that 1968 movie was: it was symbolically predicting the future. It was an early warning that the grandiose spaceship being built for the coming Conquest of the Universe is going to come crashing down to Earth. And when it crashes, humans will have reduced themselves into creatures that are incapable of communication, again symbolized by having lost their speech... in the latest movie to make it easier for the scientistic, this happens because of a virus (since they are incapable of understanding the symbolism). Or.. another better possibility in the script could have been a reverse mutation/switching off of the FOXP2 gene because of environmental epigenetic factors ... that would have been an ""evolutionary adaptation"", no?Just in case you are wondering what the hell I am talking about: its an example of the kind of scientistic jargon that results from the loss of ability to communicate.! In any case, the point of the symbolism is that humans, because of their actions, will lose their ability to communicate and sink into a state where even apes appear to be more morally conscious than humans. Pity that the irony of this symbolism will not strike the scientistic, as they have totally lost the ability to communicate with ""humanity"", and cannot comprehend anything not congruous with their doctrine of Evolutionism. Therefore this movie too will be disappointing for the evolutionists who will denounce it as ""cheesy nonsense"" that might even corrupt the minds of their kids studying evolution in school.",War for the Planet of the Apes
360,michael-young-585,Not Just for Visual Effects!,8,14 March 2018,"You should see this movie. Even if you aren't a science fiction fan, this movie scores success as a drama rich in emotion and with characters that have depth and connection in ways that many other movies fail to achieve.It is even more amazing that the most significant characters aren't human. And yet, in this movie, it is the apes that command your respect and even your love, not the humans. By the end of this movie, you are well along the way of seeing the world as one where humans have fallen by the wayside and another order picks up the evolutionary baton. Without any surprise at all, at least not until the next day or so, you are perfectly OK with that outcome!I was surprised to learn that there have been 9 major motion pictures about the Planet of the Apes. It started with a book of that name from a French writer Pierre Boulles published in 1963. The first movie, of the same name, came out five years later and famously starred Charlton Heston. Over the next five years, four more movies were produced (Beneath, Escape, Conquest, and Battle of ...) which further developed the concept of a world where evolution on Earth produces a different result than the familiar one. After nearly 20 years of studio infighting, Tim Burton produced a reboot of the series in 2001, however it failed to generate much critical or audience support.In 2005 a new attempt at rebooting the franchise started up and in 2011 Rise of the Planet of the Apes was released. It was positioned as a prequel to explain exactly how the human/ape inversion occurred and how apes, under the competent leadership of Caesar advanced to take over the world. That was followed by Dawn... in 2014 and then this movie last year. These last three movies complete the background story and either bring us back to the point in time of the original movie, or position us for a new round of character and plot development, taking this history in new directions. Although the story-line must necessarily change, I doubt we've seen the end of the Planet of the Apes franchise.One huge reason that these last three movies have been so successful, both with audiences and critics, is because of the visual effects. Although the technology was quite young with the first movie, all three of these movies utilize motion-capture and CGI (computer-generated-imagery) to creat their realities. It works by filming a scene with regular actors who have light capturing dots implanted all over their face and bodies. When an actor smiles, for example, it raises and lowers one or more of those dots on his face. These dots can then be mapped to a different, artificial, face and the computer can then move that face, like making a smile, by raising and lowering those same dots on a different composition of textured and colored skin and hair. The result is a computer generated image that moves exactly like the original actor. Avatar (in 2009) was the breakthrough film with that technology, and it has only become more powerful as computer speed and ability has increased over the last decade.It is exactly that technology that secured this movie its well-deserved Oscar nomination in Visual Effects. With this third movie, the technology is so secure that it is just not possible to tell that these apes are not actually speaking, acting, and feeling exactly as they appear in the movie. The reality created here is more than convincing. If you need just one reason to see this movie, this is it.But this movie is much more than just a visual-effects laden science fiction blockbuster. It is also a movie with rich characters, a compelling story, and an overall balance that is not common in film spectacles.Andy Serkis plays, for the third time, the main character, Caesar, and while we see him through the computer generated mask of an ape, we still see some terrific acting. Serkis manages a range of facial expressions that successfully transfer the power of human feeling to a non-human face. The result is humbling as well as generating a great deal of curiosity and sympathy for this unique character. (Serkis did the same thing, and using the same CGI technology, starring as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit movies. Curiously, he hasn't yet received any Oscar nominations for acting, but he should have.)Serkis isn't the only human-ape. As an ensemble, the team of apes succeeds in creating a community of beings deserving of our empathy and even aspirations. As secondary beings, there are a few humans in the movie, however, they are so unimportant, relative to the apes, that they don't even have names. There is a young girl, befriended by the apes because, in self-defense, they had to kill her Father. She does play an important role in the movie, but is mute and has no name until they assign one to her by giving her a car nameplate that spells 'Nova'. (That name is also the name of a blond female human character in the original movie.)And Woody Harrelson does an excellent job portraying a human military commander who has no name other than 'Colonel'. Although he seems fully aware of the futility of the struggle of humans versus the ape-world - understanding that they will not win in the long run - he nonetheless portrays all the negative human characteristics even to the point of echoing the sick and lost Marlon Brando character in Apocalypse Now. If Colonel is the best that humans can put forward, why exactly should we care about their ultimate demise?The movie was written and directed by the same folks who gave us the earlier Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and so are able to continue the story without forcing leaps of the imagination. They also worked on the two Cloverfield movies, Total Recall, and LIve Free and Die Hard, and so are able to combine intense drama with thrilling action and adventure.In addition to its stunning visual realism, the strength of this movie comes from the large philosophical issues that it poses as well as the emotional drama that connects us to those issues. At one level, the movie succeeds in showing us the visceral power of love, family, and community - at times bringing us to tears. But those same emotions take on greater importance when you realize, maybe the next day, that you weren't feeling them about the humans in the movie. In fact, the movie gives you hope not that humans will, at the end of the day sort things out and make the world a better place to live. But rather you come to feel that maybe Mother Earth will survive not because of humans, but despite them. And that maybe the something else that comes along might just be a happier result.This movie deserved more Oscar recognition. It is not just a special effects vehicle.",War for the Planet of the Apes
361,alexandregatineau,Surprising,7,30 January 2018,"Just to be clear, my title is ""surprising"" because I didn't see the 2 previous movies when I saw that one. (Now I have).Anyway, a big surprise, Planet of the Apes movies are always a huge risk, a risk to be a cringeworthy fest of talking Apes.But not here, they did it. The Apes are humans enough for you to actually care and root for them. The balance between sign language and talking is perfect. The CGI is bluffing, I couldn't tell the difference between a real ape or a CGI one. Although we have to admit, only the main ape characters look ""original"". The crowds are always a bit generic. 
The downside to me is the plot, no spoilers but the whole colonel thing and his role... not very interesting. That's the only reason I didn't give 8 stars.

363,davidarcher,Essentially a remake of 1984's Red Dawn,7,15 July 2017,"With a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 94%, I'm sure I'll be in minority, but seeing this movie is mostly like watching ape-fur dry.While ostensibly the third film in the prequel series, it's essentially a remake of the original Muricans vs Commies version of Red Dawn – with a bit of The Great Escape tossed in. And, a bit of Apolypse Now, but more on that later.The movie is good but not great, and often drags on interminably. This is especially true in the first act, which features mostly apes, because  apes  talk  very  slowly. The movie picks up when the apes start interacting with the humans, if only because the humans talk a bit faster. Most of the second act is set at a combo fortress / detention camp. Which – even though they're preparing for a major attack – has the world's worst security. People and apes regularly walk in and out of the camp with no one noticing.While the movie tries to maintain an air of gravitas – after all, we're talking about the survival of the human race here – some of movie is downright hokey, such as the flower-behind-the-ear bit or the whole ""Bad Ape"" character. (He's kind of the Apes' version of Jar Jar Binks.)For all practical purposes, the movie features only two and a half human characters: Woody Harrelson plays Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, uh, I mean, ""The Colonel,"" and as always is excellent. Amiah Miller is luminous as Nova, the young girl adopted by the apes, while Gabriel Chavarria has an expanded cameo as a soldier named Preacher. The ape characters are more challenging as they, with a few exception, all look alike. And, while the motion-capture and CGI folks have done an amazing job with the apes' faces, their bodies still need some work. Top-billed Andy Serkis deserves an Academy Award for this performance as well as his body of work to date, and Karin Konoval is note- worthy as Maurice. Much of the movie was filmed in British Columbia, and the scenery is spectacular. This is a slow summer for movies, and this one is better than most of the current releases. See it now if you liked the first two, or if you want to spend two hours out of the heat.",War for the Planet of the Apes
364,fisherbee1-1,War - Were they trying to kill the franchise??,4,16 July 2017,"I was excited to go watch this installment having really enjoyed the previous two movies. Seeing it, however, was quite disappointing. The visuals were fine, as expected, and the acting was as good as ever. The story, however, seemed to crawl, and the anti-American anti-military, and anti-Christian references removed any remaining enjoyment. Instead of seeing things from both perspectives, as we did in the previous two movies, it's all from the viewpoint of the apes, and humans are seen as evil, and mostly shallow. No deep human characters in the entire film, no perspective of the humans; just flat villains about which the apes have to worry. There are some references to the old film series, which fans will notice, and an amusing few places, but the political theming and dragging storyline make this one far under par.",War for the Planet of the Apes
365,breheneyjames,Apes! Together! Strong!,10,15 July 2017,"Wow. First off let me just say how excited I am for Matt Reeves to direct 'The Batman'. He took the reigns of this franchise from Rupert Wyatt after 'Rise' and really made it his own and elevated it with 'Dawn'. I also believe he elevated it again with 'War' which closes out this superb prequel trilogy.There is not a wasted shot in this film. Everyone of them is composed with an impressive attention to detail that just leaves you in awe. It is clear that Matt Reeves is a strong visual director and he works with his cinematographer Michael Seresin very well here to deliver some of the best visuals of the year so far.There are many inspirations on display in this film that Matt Reeves has talked about from 'The Ten Commandments', 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Even the first appearance of Caesar in the movie has his colony of apes parting to make way for their leader a la the red seas for Moses. Also the score by Michael Giacchino is the perfect companion for this story and has a 'Seven Samurai' feel to it.The story is powerful and emotionally resonant thanks to full bodied characters and a stunning performance by Andy Serkis as Caesar. If there was ever a time for him to receive an Academy Award nomination for his work this would be it. Steve Zahn is also fantastic as Bad Ape who works wonderfully as comedic relief in an otherwise grim and dreary film. Other performances of note are Woody Harrelson as The Colonel who gives you every reason to resent him but is also someone who is affected by personal tragedy (which leads to a moving scene where Caesar empathizes with him) and Amiah Miller as Nova who says a lot without speaking a word. The 'War' that the title refers to is not a physical war but a war of ideals between both Caesar and The Colonel and within Caesar himself. So don't expect an all out action set-piece a minute war movie. It's a much more personal, dramatic and emotional story and the film is all the more better for it. A perfect movie to round out a perfect trilogy. Apes. Together. Strong.",War for the Planet of the Apes

This one is all about nosense, main characters protected by some kind of magic that makes them invisible, invulnerable and all that bs we know. Some 10/10 say the bad reviews are for political reasons, or autistic, or dumbness... but hey, maybe the 10/10 was about it.

They all speak English too - remarkable.The highly predictable and ultimately boring story is on a wholly insufficient scale to call itself a war for a planet. I was mislead into expecting much more war and a scale altogether more planetary.On the plus side, it did fill some time and was very convincing in its depiction of cold weather.",War for the Planet of the Apes
368,cherchezan,Classic Bait & Switch,6,27 July 2017,"I rarely write reviews unless a movie disappoints me. I went to see an action movie and I got maybe 20 minutes of action and the rest was boooooooooooooooooooooooring, almost fell asleep twice, in 4d, if the chair wasn't moving and they weren't spraying us with water on occasion it would have made for some good rest. The special effects are impressive, the apes are pretty much indistinguishable from real ones, which I found quite amazing, but aside from that, boring, boring boring. Doesn't anyone read these scripts before going ahead and making those movies? The story is pretty stupid, the leaders of the apes leave their ""people"" to go on their own side quest, leaving them literally leaderless to wonder towards some promise of a better place, they get a cute little girl to follow them around that cries when the ape she just met a day ago dies but doesn't give two poops when her dad was killed by the apes just a day before, there is much more that is bad with it, you gotta see it to believe it. They make it from the snow covered mountains to the desert within a day or so by walking slowly... Also, aren't apes tropical animals? how do they survive in the God damn snow without any protection? anyway.... it's bad, if you are not a kid, wait for it to come out on DVD or whatever people that don't download movies use these days and use it as a sleep aid, 10 minutes before bedtime and you'll be fast asleep. Only thing that redeems this movie somewhat are the amazing special effects, otherwise a pretty crappy movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes
369,Skaigear,"""Emotions of the Planet of the Apes""",8,17 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is the third film of the rebooted Planet of the Apes franchise following Rise and Dawn, directed by Matt Reeves who also directed the second film. The Apes series is one of those series that I never really feel hype for leading up to it, like I do with a Marvel movie or a new Disney movie, but once I sit down in the theater and actually watch them, they never cease to amaze me on just how well made they are. Main reason I think for that is because each film of the series is not made to be part of a cinematic universe filled with setups for other films; instead they are just focused on making one good movie each time. And despite taking this approach, this Apes trilogy of Rise, Dawn and War perfectly flows from one film to the next seamlessly with character and story growth that makes sense. We see the leader of the apes, Caesar going from a naïve baby chimpanzee to a benevolent leader to someone who has just seen enough of mankind's cruelty and wants to strike back in this third entry.First off, without spoilers, the movie's title is bit of a misnomer, as the ""War"" referenced is not what you might imagine, especially after the much more action-packed Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The movie has action scenes, but they are the consequences of the drama, and they are there to serve the emotions, not the other way around like most blockbusters nowadays (i.e. Transformers). In fact, if you were to replace the CGI apes with a persecuted minority group portrayed by live action actors, the film would be more similar to an art-house historical drama like Schindler's List than anything else. For this reason, the movie should been titled ""Emotions of the Planet of the Apes,"" because my god, this movie has like 10 super emotional moments, where most big budget films would be lucky if they receive two or three.The movie worked very well for me because of amazing CGI, character development, suspenseful action and emotional, sometimes gut-wrenching scenes. The film also paces itself pretty well, with very little exposition, and jumps straight to the point in most instances. Right from the beginning, we get an ill-fated scene that pushes the character of Caesar to give him a new motivation for the rest of the movie. Everything that was established before that scene sets up it up perfectly, and I was in shock when it happened. This film did not let up, as moments like this happens again and again, without ever feeling forced or sappy, all appropriate for the circumstances within the story. My particular favorite moment being a very tender scene between the little girl and the gorilla character involving a cherry blossom tree; with no dialogue and only performance and music, the moment was still able to tug on my heart strings.Andy Serkis plays Caesar, and once again his performance is the key to the film. Unlike the first two where Caesar was more reactive to situations, in War, Serkis has to play him filled with rage, and it worked. He has nuances of someone who has had enough of being hunted and victimized, which directly combats with his innate compassionate nature. Andy Serkis plays this inner turmoil to perfection and the fact he did this wearing a mocap suit is even more of a testament. A movie is only as strong as its main villain and Woody Harrelson as the Colonel was one bad man. Intimidating, scary and a worthy adversary to the apes, Harrelson's character is willing to go to places I could not have imagined before for an Apes movie. The rest of the apes were also very likable, the standouts to me being Maurice and Bad Ape. Maurice is again the trustworthy right-hand man to Caesar and aside from his effects being fantastic, he gave off a sweet, sympathetic vibe that you cannot help but like him. Bad Ape is the new comedic relief character, and if done wrong, could have been the movie's downfall, but I feel his inclusion as the zoo Ape who does not know Ape speech is very important as a contrast to another character. The little girl Caesar and crew finds, Nova was a very good character and might be the heart and soul of the film. I love her sweet interactions with the apes, to juxtapose how seemingly more humans the apes are becoming.The good guys in the movie are placed in an impossible situation facing a villain who is uncompromising; this makes each action sequence tension-filled and enthralling. You really feel like not everyone is going to make it out alive and there is no plot armor for anybody, not even Caesar. I rooted for the apes, and wanted nothing more than for them get out of their circumstance. This is only possible because the characters were so well established throughout the movie, making us care about them and their plight. War for the Planet of the Apes is a great natural ending to this awesome trilogy. It is a desolate, sometimes depressing film that is lightened up only by sweet, tender moments and highly emotional scenes. I would not call this an action movie, so those looking for a movie with a chimp riding a horse wielding dual machineguns again, I suggest you go and watch Dawn. But if you want a human drama with the central characters being ironically, non-humans, War is a must-see.",War for the Planet of the Apes
370,WhiteFire404,War for the Planet of the Apes - Review,9,22 August 2017,"After two really good movies, War definitely had a lot to live up to, is not often that the third film in a trilogy or any movie franchise really, is as good as the previous movies, some few cases are Return of the King, The Bourne Ultimatum and Army of Darkness, among a few others, now we can add War to that list. Reeves has proved to be not just a good director, but a great one, his directing in this film is in my opinion the best in his entire filmography, also, I really feel this is the best movie in the reboot trilogy and is the only Apes movie that has gotten as close as the 1968 original in regards of quality. Andy Serkis also delivers his best performance as Caesar and one of his best performances ever period, and for the first time a human character does has the same depth than the apes, Woody Harrelson delivered a great performance and his character was very interesting and intimidating. Something I haven't mentioned about the two previous movies is the musical score, Michael Giacchino's score for this film is magnificent, is epic and really well done. Also out of all the movies in this trilogy, War probably has the best story out of the 3. This is truly one of the greatest conclusions to a trilogy ever and is a must watch for any fan of this franchise.",War for the Planet of the Apes
371,wasecan,Timeline Question *Spoilers*,7,14 November 2017,"Something's not quite right with the time-line. The ages of Cornelius & Nova in this film suggest that it's only about 15-20 years later that Charlton Heston lands there (in the original film). I've always gathered that in the original, Earth had been that way for many generations, possibly even centuries, but this makes it look like Charlie H got there no more a decade or so after somewhat ""normal"" human civilization & technology. And that's assuming that all ended at the end of this movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes
372,PeaceGuard,A perverted message without credibility,6,23 October 2017,"I was expecting a 7-9 rating after the first 1/3-1/2 of the movie. Unfortunately it got worse and worse with time.The monkeys worry about leaving the forest without alarming the soldiers even though they practically have 1 base and maybe 1-2 expeditionary bases at single points, kilometers away from each other.A girl lives with her warden, maybe father. He takes care of her even though she got sick for some monkey illness and he risks the same. He meets a couple of monkeys which point guns at him. He tries to kill them before they kill him, he fails. The girl sees his body, does not care at all, whatever. The next day or a couple of days later one of her warden/father's killer dies, which makes her incredibly sad and crying.There are some soldiers in an abandoned base. They guard hundreds of intelligent monkeys with the use of a single man. A man who does open their cage and walk into it, full of monkeys. He doesn't even need to be pulled below the ground, he can be incapacitated at any moment, like from behind or whatever.The base is constructed in a way that some single ill-thrown cigarette butt can make the whole place explode.There's like 30 cm of soil between the ground of the base and some sewers below it. No one falls there even though if it can be easily dug up with hands from below, it would be easily destroyed with an adult mans weight, but whatever.There's some assault at the base. Even though the attackers do have some long range tanks/howitzers/cannons they just send their air forces first to be shot down, which they are, with almost every missile reaching its target. Then they just mindlessly storm the base with no cautiousness.In general, even though I am a liberal, the movie feels like some radical left-wing propaganda. Our race is worse than the other race. Men society is worse than a mixed society. White society is worse than black society. Our society is devoid of even one compassionate person, unlike theirs. Our race deserves total extinction regardless of whether you are a part of faction which does care for human life or a part of one which doesn't.Even the forces of nature will trigger at the right time to exterminate our race. Well, why even bother to shoot these two hours of film if they could just start with the avalanche destroying all humans? Why not use the same tactic in other war movies? An snow/rock/mud/sand avalanche destroys one side of a conflict and you don't have to bother with all these technicalities, right?",War for the Planet of the Apes

The movie was filled with plot holes and a poor concept. The previous two were brilliant with story lines where you were drawn into the dilemmas between ape and man but the third one there was none of that. There were a few characters that didn't fit and I was perplexed why the young girl was added, I can only imagine to give the apes and one human some positive interaction. The main villain didn't get a lot of screen time and I do wonder if Woody Harrelson was miscast for the role. If like me when you finish watching the movie you will be asking the same questions like ""why did they do that...what was the reason for that...how did they manage that?"" then it is obvious the movie didn't give the audience a better thought out script without gaping plot holes.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Even Spider-Man was just like any other superhero movie has to offer nothing novel.

War further provides a new standard for CGI as well as blockbusters in general by providing a story that is just about as exhilarating as it's action set pieces and with a breathtaking performance by Andy Serkis, War for the Planet of the Apes is the final grand piece of a fantastic trilogy and is a perfect example of the potential of prequels and reboots.",War for the Planet of the Apes
379,noloxtreme,Deus ex machina of the planet of the apes,5,16 July 2017,"The first movie of the year to me that did not live up to the high expectations set by the first two. Dawn of the planet of the apes is still to me the best of the series.As others have also stated, this was not really a ""War"" for the planet. Which is a bit weird, seeing as we've already an impressive battle between humans and apes in Dawn. I was expecting more of that, but on a more epic scale-the final showdown for the planet. On one side, Woody Harrelson's character-a multi layered character. Humanity's greatest and last hope, making one final stand. And on another, Caesar-leading his species in their final fight against humanity for dominance of the planet. I was expecting epic, complex military strategies and battles. But alas, all we got was Caesar's personal quest for revenge and an ape concentration camp. Hell, that would be fine if the apes didn't have to then depend on Deus ex machina, stupidity and coincidence to escape the camp.I honestly don't know what the director was going for with this movie. The title certainly doesn't fit the movie. This movie did not really move the plot forward, other than to try to tie in the original movie where humans could no longer speak. But you can't make an entire movie just on that premise. Anyways. It's a solid trilogy but the last part is the weakest of the series. I just wanted to see Caesar, emulate his namesake Julius Caesar and lead the Apes in battle. We didn't get that.",War for the Planet of the Apes
380,lipjam,Sometimes less is more.,6,9 August 2017,"This movie is not as bad as some make out but it is not as good as others make out either. Overall it is a disappointing conclusion to the trilogy.First the good:The technical production is excellent. The cinematography is impressive and the Special FX astounding. The characterisation is in depth and believable (for the most part) with some memorable parts. I particularly liked the young girl (Amiah Miller) and the chimp (Bad Ape) provided some light relief. Caesar is of course the star of the show and his part is played to perfection and his character is developed very well. It is a real shame that all the actors and production team is so badly let down by the script. This should have been a great movie but with such a poor story line it can never be. The fact that it lacks any coherence and has so many holes points to a script by committee. One committee worked on the ape story line while another worked on the human one and like their protegees, kept to their own kind and never really got on together.The Colonel character and story line is just beyond belief. You could argue he was insane so that would account for the many disparities but that just will not cut it. He tries to kill Caesar then when he captures him, does not and for no apparent reason. A blind man could see that Caesar will lead the apes to revolt yet he does not notice this. There is not enough development of his back story and why anyone would unquestionably follow him. Woody Harrelson is neither scary nor inspirational enough to believe. Further, the colonel is the only human character of note. All the other humans are just cannon fodder or background decoration with the exception of the crossbow man and Nova. Considering this I think a more menacing presence was required like Tom Hardy.The whole reason for the plot just does not add up. Firstly, the colonel is seen as the scourge of the apes and wants to kill them all. Then he is the scourge of other humans. This is all done with very poor story development and riddled with plot holes. It was like they were more concerned with the money moments then they were with an overall story.Then ending is just a wet fish. I will not detail it here but the story has many disparate sub plots (too many in my opinion) to wrap up in the allotted time. Then suddenly somebody realised that the movie was running too long and they ended them all in a hurry. I suspect this was so more time could be given to the money moment of Caesar at the end (which also lacked any real satisfactory impact). I believe this was lifted directly from Moses but again without a sufficient backstory it did not have the desired impact.I am not saying it is a bad movie but I don't think anyone could call it a great movie either. I think they just tried to fit too much into a single movie and failed to join it all up satisfactorily. I think too much was assumed and dependent on the goodwill of the audience to indulge. It should have been two instalments and more time should have been used to develop the human story and maybe tie up the inconsistencies in the plot. If this was not feasible then they should have completely reworked the story and got someone more menacing to play the colonel. A decent effort but not a suitable ending to the trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes
381,esthercross,A tidal wave of khaki and brown and angst,2,22 July 2017,"I personally struggled to stay motivated with this one. Whilst we should applaud the magician worthy skills of the CGI technicians, I found myself emotionally disconnected from the story and my eyes where craving that other 75 percent of the colour wheel by the end.Structurally I think it is always a rocky choice to put a fight scene at the very start of the film as even in the case of sequels we are not as emotionally invested in the outcome of the characters and you loose the important fight scene tension. I needed the person beside me to check my pulse for how little I felt for the opening battle. If we had seen some touching exchange between ape families with some heartfelt music I may have felt more about the outcome of the opening 15 minutes.Planet of the apes doesn't offer much in the way of relief from the dreary colours, angst and rain. The film doesn't have much of a sense of humour about it other then the token laugh an hour character 'bad ape' who was charming but not enough to save the film for me. I don't want to let it go by unmentioned though that I think Andy Serkis is Devine and endlessly watchable. I think that the sincerity within Caesars portrayal was mesmerising. It was almost a well crafted duet between Serkis and the breath taking capabilities of modern CGI.Unfortunately I'm gonna have to return to the small matter of me not enjoying the film. Another point I have to made is that I felt that the moments of tenderness where at times a little contrived. The film needed more poetry as a whole but the few attempts at a heartfelt scene for me where a little tenuous I don't wanna include spoilers but you might agree that the 'sad' scene with the 'reprised blossom behind the ear' didn't quite have the right foundation for actual poignancy.Right at the start of the film a drunk man arrived late and made his way to his front row seat across the front of the auditorium with his bottle of water held high in a victorious manner (perhaps he sneaked in) he continued to walk with vigour until he collided with the wall opposite. I know that the people I watched Planet of the Apes with also weren't particularly taken with the film because when we filed out the cinema the drunk man was the first and only thing my friends wanted to talk about.",War for the Planet of the Apes

383,JamiroBontes,A wonderful conclusion to one of the best trilogy's of all time!,8,31 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes follows Caesar who has to handle a dark side of himself that he didn't know was there before. When you see the title of the movie you will think it's about a big war that's going to happen between the humans and the apes, but that's not what it is. The movie is about the internal war with in Caesar. There is action in the movie but it's not an action movie.The performance of Andy Serkis is Oscar worthy, he is really fantastic as Caesar. Also Woody Harrelson as the Colonel is fantastic. Everybody in the film is amazing. Matt Reeves direction is so emotionally pact and great, he is an amazing director.It's a movie with so much passion.

384,LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt,War? Huh...? What is it good for...? Absolutely nothing!,6,18 July 2017,"The final film in the Planet of the Apes trilogy is a fairly fitting send off to Caesar and his kind. The first film was a stellar reinvention of this age old franchise, and the second continued in its wake, while bringing with it greater emotional stakes and a visceral intensity. In terms of tone and atmosphere, this final film follows its predecessor, which lends to a depth and sincerity unadulterated by needless quips and one-liners that have now become characteristic of summer blockbusters. With this earnestness comes a tonal balance and a self-confident narrative structure. With that said, War for the Planet of the Apes is slow paced, almost to a fault. I found this to be one of the more perplexing aspects of the movie; it would more often than not slow down to an absolute crawl. And what was more unsettling was the manner in which these slow, essentially character building moments were not evenly placed throughout but were instead played out consecutively. This slowness is not merely an attribute of the narrative but of the physical movement of the characters. I honestly believe that if the first half was sped up to 1.25 times it's actual pace, the movie would have benefited gravely. As it stands the adamant slow pace of the movie only seems to draw attention to itself, claiming right to great 'moments' without having earned them. The story was alarmingly simple. Caesar's personal storyline was hefty, but the rest seemed more a series of happenstance than an intricately plotted extravaganza. Caesar and his squad are well explored, but the human soldiers are dispiritingly alienated, which it's predecessor knowledgeably avoided. There is one character in particular who was highlighted multiple times but remained as unfamiliar at the end, as at the beginning. The little girl introduced had one of the more affecting scenes of the movie and added a lot of heart to proceedings. By far the greatest aspects of the movie are it's CGI and cinematography. The CGI surrounding the motion capture is flawless and immediately arresting. In the same vein, the cinematography(also CGI enhanced) is breathtaking. Shot after shot, the visuals are spellbinding and bring the world to life in vivid detail. The 3D was beautifully handled, which is a rarity despite advances in the movie watching experience. These reasons alone make this movie one to catch on the big screen. SPOILERS AHEAD- Having discussed the film overall, I am wont to divulge into a couple of specifics. It's only obvious that every thing that transpires in this universe, is because of the actions of James Franco's character from the first movie. Considering this, I was personally keen on having him referenced in this film; it would have been immensely gratifying to have had Caesar affectionately recall his long gone human friend, who made him what he is today, and draw from this recollection, the honest truth that not every human is a lost cause. Also, it was anticlimactic to learn that there was no real ""war"" in the third act of the film, and as genuinely curious as it is to have the war for the planet of the APES be fought by and amongst humans themselves, the incredulity of the circumstances of the apes' escape already apparent, are driven further home with that dues ex machina- esque avalanche that conveniently buries the entirety of the human army and leaves the apes unscathed, trees or not. The abandoned tunnels mere inches below the prison camp are an absurd inconvenience, more so the idea that merely pushing against the roof of the tunnels opens sudden gaping holes on the surface; surface that has to have been trampled on by humans and apes alike. The film consistently suggests that the soldiers guarding the camp are horrifyingly incompetent, repeatedly failing to identify trespassers/escapees. The little girl makes it into and out of the camp without breaking a sweat, her return journey successful despite the ""team"" that was sent to ""sweep"" the area. A hundred apes disappear at night, and it takes ONE of the soldiers until morning to even have a clue. Despite being prepped for the arrival of the rival human army, the camp is aware of their arrival only after the enemy has drawn first blood. Individually, these events can be appreciated, but their punctuality reeks of convenience. END OF SPOILERAll in all, War for the Planet of the Apes is a visually stunning film, commendably scored and ably acted, even if it is lacking in the finer details of plausibility and scope.",War for the Planet of the Apes

What a mindless crowd of 'bots parroting paid commercial hype about something that has NO STORY, NO WAR and NO PURPOSE other than making money off of total morons. The way people mindlessly react to marketing cues like trained poodles is disturbing in the extreme. Could be useful as a first date movie or a new friend that you're not really sure about. Anyone that thinks this is a great movie is not worth associating with beyond what it takes for you to drive them home after the movie.It's almost like English panto. The play isn't funny, everyone knows what will happen, and the audience reacts on cue with as stereotypical dialogue as the actors. Seriously, targeted at gen Y? Have millennials actually been raised to react like little 'bots to particular commercial stimuli? I fear so, for there is no other reason that someone would rave about this kind of big budget, Hollyweird CRAP!And they need to be sued. The screen writing is so lazy as to be non- existent, and when they do come up with a character...it's a complete rip-off of Kurtz from Apocalypse Now. I can just hear the banter among the makers of this one. ""Uh...he's a total rip-off of Kurtz."" ""Yeah, but just stick a goatee on him and it'll be OK"".And did I mention that it was boring to the point of torture? Slow? It's stops more often than a school bus, whilst running twice as slow.

But the raves received (Yes they are worth)made me overlook my decision and I went for it. I bet one cannot simply predict what's going to happen next for such cleverly written screenplay. The movie is the proof of how mature Hollywood is becoming.The eyewash and lavishing landscapes for what the world would be if human extincts. The hunger for power and control on the world, even when they are about to extinct. Woody Harrelson as the colonel was one of the most outstanding part of the fabric,and of-course, all hail the Caeser. The Irony is, being human, the support for Apes is the war was only because of him.For the Director Matt Reeves, I believe The Batman movie is totally justified, yes he has a Nolan like themed direction and yet it's his own style.

It's that the primary focus was on to tell the story rather than making it a visual effects treat.All in all, the movie is a ""Must Watch"" for good cinema fans...",War for the Planet of the Apes
388,adamdaly1985,Hollywood Propaganda at it's Worst,2,18 July 2017,"I entered the theatre with a relatively open mind. I had recently seen 'Get Out' after my reluctance in being entertained by more leftist social justice propaganda had somewhat subsided. And I was incredibly surprised. I loved the film! Yes, there were heavy nods to the oppression of people of colour but it was done intelligently and from a somewhat unique angle. Plus, the film was well written, well acted and paced perfectly. So despite the trailer for 'War for the Planet of the Apes' looking like a grotesquely obvious allegory for the upcoming race-war, I figured I might be wrong. I hated the prospect of Jordan Peele's 'Get Out' and the film quickly became a favourite of 2017 for me. It turns out I was right all along. The film stinks of social justice and white privilege. The overwhelmingly white human race are portrayed as a wholly irredeemable group of oppressive savages. Meanwhile the Apes are the oppressed. The unfairly vilified. The misunderstood. The empathetic and admirable. The unsubtle links to today's cultural environment wouldn't have been any more obvious if scene's were dressed in 'Ape Lives Matter' banners or Antifa masks.As far as the film itself, it's about the least layered piece I may ever have seen. There's no subtext, no intelligent subplots. Apes are good, (white) humans are bad. I really can't expand any further on this storytelling mechanic. It is what it is, albeit with lots of CGI. I've ran out of energy to finish reviewing this disappointment. Why the IMDb rating is so high can only reflect either a declining level of acceptable standards or the production company purchasing IMDb accounts. I have seen far more poor reviews than positive and cannot accept people interested in good film would be so complimentary of this huge pile of visual faeces. 2/10",War for the Planet of the Apes

The only problem I have with the movie is that when you see apes in great number, some of them look like the cgi was not finished and they stood out to me.I was expecting a us vs them kind of story and was pleasantly surprised that it was much more nuanced than that. I will not spoil the story so all I can say is that it had my attention from start to finish.There is also a genius move that the writer did. The inclusion of Nova as a kid. I usually hate kids in movies but she was perfect. She humanized the ape so much. Also the ""comic relive"" character was done in a way that at no point it gets on your nerves.This is a must watch and if you have not seen the first 2 than what are you doing here.

PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THE TITLE WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES IS MISLEADING.People also seem to have missed the point that the film is about the effects of war and how LEADERS often must fight their own internal war between doing what is best for their people and what is best for them personally, and how opposite those things truly are when you're fighting a war.I just don't understand what people wanted or were expecting. Did you think you were gonna see Platoon but with Apes? That'd would've been dumb and completely against what P.O.T.A. has always been about..... Name me a single P.O.T.A. movie (with exception of that Tim Burton piece of crap) that was more about fight scenes than about the themes of the franchise(and if you say Battle for POTA, the movie was about the Watts riots caused by racism, and regarded as arguably the worst)This film, while certainly the weakest of the new tilogy, was still pretty darn good and effective.

Not only is it the best of all the POTA movies (in my opinion) it's also beautiful, epic and really shows us the struggle of the apes as they are slaughtered one by one by humans. It also shows Caesars struggle as he wants peace but the humans refuse, and how each battle slowly start becoming more and more like his brother, Koba. There are also plenty of moments in this movie where I almost shed a tear. The relationships, the death and the character motivations. The people behind these films really know what they're doing and are able to establish a strong relationship between characters pretty much instantly. And even though the relationship between girl and the gorilla seemed a bit rushed, it was still powerful and showed that these characters act like normal people (stupid, me saying that, considering the fact we are talking about intelligent apes).

This film is purely ape driven. Very little human interaction as the others which was a delight for me. The CGI is groundbreaking and that helps when so much is steeped in ape life and the decisions they all make some good some very bad. I found it very clever how the writers incorporated the tragic history of slavery in the writing and how it shaped each character. Andy Sardekis(?) is just incredible, at some point he's bound for an Oscar and Woody Harrelson does a great job as the rebel leader. It's an enjoyable film with historic and religious tones.

OK, use him, but why putting him in all those positions that are so clichéd...Andy Serkis rocks (as he got us used to with Gollum / King Kong, etc) in this one.

396,bijanadhikari,It's a new era for the Apes and hopefully the way they make blockbuster.,10,13 October 2017,"First of all after seeing so many bad reviews given to this movie by some IMDb users with many giving it one star I just had to write this review. I just want to ask those people what do you people even consider a good movie. Seriously? I want to examine are they just a bunch of trolls or are they so brainwashed by Hollywood's mediocrity of giving them spoon fed blockbuster like transformers, fast and furious and marvel franchise that when a masterpiece does comes along does it fly just by their head? Well either of those must had to happen here. Now to review it.Directed by Matt Reeves, War For the Planet Of The Apes brings an epic conclusion to the Planet Of the Apes trilogy. Now how do I describe this film without using the word ""epic"" because this film screams epicness from the opening scene to the last.Led by a powerful performance by Andy Serkins, Caesar is more emotional and devastated than ever before. The opening very much decides his journey and it all makes perfect sense with why he is doing it. The way we see his character develop from a innocent infant from the very first part to the beast who has only vengeance in his mind is what every main character from any franchise should aspire to be in context to the character development.Rest of the cast all give solid performance led by Woody Harrelson who plays a perfect bad guy but with some interesting development throughout the film.I think what makes this film standout from the rest of the blockbuster is the emotional grip this film delivers at every scene. There isn't a single forced or dull moment in here and all ties perfectly with the plot. And that's very impressive to do in a 2hr 20min. film. Action scenes are very minimal considering for the title with a war and described as a action film but when it comes it will leave you on the edge of your seat.I would like to thank Matt Reeves and screenwriter Mark Bomback for their brilliant vision and the way executed this. Bravo, this is what a summer blockbuster should be.The themes they tackle with their story is very deep and powerful. Particularly the way take Caesar into the situation he has never been in before. Its just not about his vengeance but the people he has cared and the ones he meets.Lastly I highly recommend this movie to everyone who loves cinema. Don't expect a transformers kind of action scenes with no dialogue or you'll be disappointed. Just seat and be patient and you will be rewarded with a masterful film making that oozes greatness. And to those giving this 1 star you are what's wrong for film these days. Just stick to your mediocre Michael Bay actions and leave this one alone if think this deserved this 1 star rating. The cinematography alone makes it 7/10 film if you don't liked the story or expecting more actions.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Secondly, some of the overly saturated cries of praise look honest and innocent, which proves only the steep drop in intelligence, pointing to clearly somewhat sub-human intelligence. I mean people differ in taste or expertise, but c'mon! By the time we are 18 we've seen enough films to be able to at least vaguely tell a good one from a bad one.",War for the Planet of the Apes
398,dermobreen,If they continue at this standard I welcome the fourth.,8,22 July 2017,"After Dawn and Rise we arrive at War of the Planet of the Apes or WOTPOTA for short!I have to admit, I was ambivalent about this third installment of the Apes trilogy. It's billed as the final however there are enough unresolved issues at the end to probably warrant a fourth. Cornelius's story anyone?WOTPOTA is directed by Matt Reeves who I first came across in the 2010 US adaption Let me in. It was a poor Americanisation of an excellent film by Thomas Alfredson called Let The Right One In. If you have never seen the 2009 original, I urge you to check it out. Not expecting much from Matt Reeves I was very pleasantly surprised by WOTPOTA.Andy Serkis once again elevates the art of motion-capture performances to a new height. He again plays Caesar, the leader of the apes, a little older now and with familial responsibilities, including a young son named Cornelius. Woody Harrelson plays the main protagonist simply known as ""The Colonel"".So let me address ""the war"". If you saw the trailer and were expecting a Battle for Helm's Deep encounter between humans and apes, then you will be disappointed, sorely disappointed.  I think this accounts for some of the poor reviews this film is getting. For me it is not deserved. The title ""war"" is a misnomer. There is no war and there is no victor. What we get is an introspection as Caesar struggles to overcome his hate and his thirst for violence. Without spoilers, the scene is set early on as to why Caesar hates the Colonel. What follows is a physical and emotional journey with images of concentration camps and brutality. The apes crucified on x-shaped crosses has echoes of the markers used to deter apes from entering The Forbidden Zone from the original 1968 Planet of the Apes film with Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowell.Steve Zahn plays an ape who calls himself ""Bad Ape"". He is the other stand-out performer in the film. He initially provides some expositions but rapidly becomes the comic relief in what is a grim film. It is a welcome relief with many old gags rolled out including using binoculars the wrong way around!Woody Harrelson plays an army colonel hell-bent on wiping out the apes. We are told (in an unresolved plot point) that the other human armies disagree with him, resulting in the final action sequence in ActIII. Harrelson's end is sign-posted along the way as we are told about the change in the original simian flu and how it now affects humans. THe introduction of Amiah Miller as Nova (played by Linda Harrison in the 1968 original) leaves more threads open for a fourth film in this reboot series.All in all WOTPOTA exceeded my expectations. The motion capture performances and the CGI are simply breath-taking, transporting you in to a fully realised, believable world. I liked Dawn, was so-so on Rise. This third episode is the best of the trilogy. If they continue at this standard I welcome the fourth.A solid 4 out of 5.",War for the Planet of the Apes
399,obiegimmie,'War for the Planet of the Apes' Review,8,24 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes, is , in summary, a visual masterpiece and a reflective piece on the bounds of humanity in times of challenge. Despite multiple flaws, War is noticeably more thoughtful than its predecessors by relying almost solely on the emotion of the apes it focuses on. HISTORY: The first Planet of the Apes was released in 1968. Starring Charlton Heston, the film is set in a dystopian planet where intelligent apes dominate and mute, incapable humans are treated as cattle. The film was an immediate hit with critics and moviegoers alike, despite featuring one of the largest movie budgets of that era, $5.8 million. Although initially intended as a stand-alone film, the commercial and critical success of the film persuaded Hollywood producers otherwise. Ape sequels ran rampant in the early 1970's, and are as follows; Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) Despite financial success, close to all of these films were demolished critically, with the exception of Escape, with generally positive reviews, and Conquest, with mixed reviews. Battle is known as the worst of the franchise.Despite several reboot attempts in the 80's and 90's, development was almost always riddled with issues. For the rest of the 20th Century, Apes would not see another appearance on the big screen. In 1999, screenwriter William Broyles Jr, to write a script. The project seized the imagination of Tim Burton, a director known for his odd yet arresting style and themes. A film was released in 2001, starring Mark Wahlberg as astronaut Leo Davidson. Davidson accidentally appears in a wormhole dominated by apes with human slaves. He then leads a human revolt to gain human independence once more. Despite a box office success of over $362 million, Burton lacked interest in a second installment, therefore the Planet of the Apes was back to its stagnant pose. In 2011 came a reboot film hoping to become a franchise. The film was titled Rise of the Planet of the Apes and followed the exploits of Caesar, a chimpanzee who receives advanced capabilities from surrogate parent, Will Rodman. Due to several incidents in which Caesar is mistreated in the outside world, he decides to collect a number of advanced apes and lead a revolt against the humans that formerly oppressed him. It essentially explains how the apes gained control of the world seen in the 1968 version. A sequel followed, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, in 2014, dealing with the effects of a massive outbreak, titled the Simian Flu, that killed more than half of the world's population. The apes remain dominant while small groups of humans huddle together trying to survive. In this film, Caesar's apes and a camp of humans are able to coexist. However, at urgings of Koba, Caesar's (former) friend, the apes attack the humans and both sides engage in an all out war. The third movie in this reboot trilogy, War for the Planet of the Apes, is the subject of this review. The plot itself is magnificently done, and while an overused trope, it ultimately prevails in this film. What one cannot help but adore in these movies is its never ceasing sense of imagination to somewhat justify a world overrun of apes. Granted, this story is ridden with predictability and clichés, but is able to balance that out with other masterful components. Rather than relying on a supposed 'war,' as the title implied, this film focuses on the merits of internal, emotional, conflict, such as Caesar struggling with his family's deaths.Do not be fooled by the appearance of a well publicized human villain, the character is significantly built off of the apes themselves. And while this film succeeds in validating a brotherhood between Caesar, Maurice, Luca, Rocket, Nova, and Bad Ape, it does not give the main characters enough development on their own. The death(s) do(es) not feel earned because, unless you had watched past films, your familiarity with these/this character(s) is/are unfounded. Therefore, his/her death is of little significance. You could make the very viable argument that this is very much Caesar's story, which is true. The main character is, evidently, Caesar himself. However, the supporting cast solidifies little to no emotional attachment making their death(s) unstable on an emotional level. **Spoilers in this paragraph**The film is a visual wonder, hands down. The effects, transitions, cinematography, CGI are works of art in their own right that inarguably make the film much more interesting. Seeing the conflict on Caesar's face as he holds a gun to Colonel's head, watching his features twist as he stares at the murderer of his family, noticing his face soften as he realizes Colonel's dismal fate...moments like these define cinema. In conclusion, War for the Planet of the Apes, while a flawed film, is still a masterpiece to behold that is, in my opinion, better than Rise and Dawn. 8/1080% (Fresh)B+",War for the Planet of the Apes

The final conclusion remains apocalyptic: They pretend to show us that men are humanly worse than animals with no middle term. Here only there are bad men, (not even a good one).

401,lucky_star_1,"PLEASE give Andy Serkis the Best Actor Academy Award, nobody deserves it more",10,25 July 2017,"RISE, DAWN, and WAR are a trilogy of movies in which Andy Serkis acts the hell out of every scene he is in. His emotions are on show 100% and for a CGI character, no words can express just how impressive that is. Caesar will be fondly remembered as a legendary warrior of cinema, certainly the best of his generation, and every single attribute goes towards Mr Serkis' compelling and emotional performance.The journey of Caesar is wrapped up in a beautiful way and should resonate with any human being who feels strongly about the themes of family and survival. Also, I'm truly bewildered by the number of people rating this excellent movie a ZERO on IMDb. WHAT?? Any part of the plot that you had a problem with does not discount the incredible commitment of every cast member and the level they perform that is FAR more realistic than any other movie or television show nowadays.I've read people saying ""the title 'War' is deceptive"" - NO IT IS NOT. These people need to consider the need for BALANCE. If every scene in this movie included fights and soldiers then it would be dull, cold, ineffective - exactly what viewers DON'T want. This movie accomplished something special. It wraps up the franchise without taking anything away from the first two instalments, both of which I loved, and it sets a new challenge for Caesar in which you're once again rooting for his willpower to overcome the struggle.I am thrilled to be part of a generation in which our young audiences have such an inspiring and loving character like Caesar to look up to.

403,JamesAlvarez520,Would Be Way Better If It Had a Different Title,8,19 July 2017,"If you're looking for some epic skull-bashing warrior apes outwitting stupid humans then look elsewhere. Both The title and the poster are misleading. This third installment of the re-imagined Planet of the Apes movies is devoid of any epic battles between the apes and humans. The opening scene and the closing scenes are the closest you'll get to actually seeing any kind of ""war"" like action and in both scenarios, the apes do not fight at all but are rather victims to the fighting. It was very unimpressive. Not like the apes that we saw in the first two movies. The first half of the film is laid out more like an amazing journey tale in which Caesar and a handful of his loyal buddies travel across the land in search for Woody Harrelson's character who is known only as ""the Colonel"". The second half of the film is the apes being oppressed and enslaved at the Colonel's secret base, in which they must escape before the ""real bad guys"" show up.There are a couple other moments that fall flat in the film as well, mainly the final confrontation between Caesar and the Colonel. The movie builds up some pretty good tension between the two opposing leaders only to have them face off, in what is arguably, the most anti-climactic boss show-down in the history of cinema. But don't cry my ape loving friends! There are also some great things about this movie too, most notably the jaw-dropping ape CGI. Every detail from the way they move, to their complex facial expressions are truly a treat to watch on screen! Andy Serkis and his fellow Ape actors will not let you down! Additionally, we are introduced to a few new ape characters, one of which is played by Steve Zahn who creates some pretty unique ape comic relief. Overall, the story is actually not bad. What makes this movie a let- down is the anticipation of an epic, high-stakes war (which does not happen). Maybe it would reflect the story a little better if it were titled something else.

410,magnusmax,War for the Planet of the Apes: No Monkeying Around!,8,2 June 2018,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a fitting end to one of my all-time favourite trilogies. Comparatively, War draws largely on Dawn in mood and feel, meshing easily from sequel to sequel. Certain shortcomings impose the need to criticise some elements, rather more so than its prequels, likely due to its proportionately heightened scale. Giachinno proves his worth as one of our best composers again. War is lightened with a generous sprinkling of comic effect - refreshing in contrast to the otherwise grim material. The VFX and acting are of a characteristically high quality, bringing emotion and meaning to a great adventure.War is better and it's worse than Dawn and Rise. What do I mean? 
War, being the culmination of all past events, is necessarily the most expansive movie in the trilogy yet, boasting (if the finished product is anything to go by) of a very large number of extras, effects and locations, in addition to one of Fox's largest ever sets. For this reason, the movie does at times stumble, where the others didn't. Under the magnifying glass, a whole host of inconsistancies and goofs jump out at the heartless critic. These detract somewhat from what is otherwise a most excellent and fitting end to one of the most underrated trilogies of all time. And I feel torn on the matter, since I'm loath to bash films I love so much; yet, to be fair, I think War failed to fully support the immense load of living up to its namesake, whereas the more ""local"" setting of the previous two was contained enough to go off successfully. Note before you watch the movie expecting tons of action that, contrary to advertising, the movie is really quite calm and may even feel slow to some. Director Matt Reeves remains focused on the real theme, however, and lives up to his reputation for delivering on character studies and centering everything on Caesar, which is the most important thing.The music is terrific. One particularly touching theme, though a little redudent throughout the movie, expresses well the beauty and emotions of the characters. The VFX are at their best, and we are rewarded with very rich performances by the phenomanal cast, as can reasonably be expected from the great Andy Serkis. Though dark and grim, the film has at times a Western feel; at others, the power of an epic (both genres were cited as being direct inspiration for the movie). Old themes are dusted off and re-used, while others are brand new. Once or twice, it ends abruptly, when a smoother transition would reduce jarring, yet, overall it is a great score for a great finale. Our new characters made good additions to the stars we are already familiar with. Steve Zahn's Bad Ape was a bold move, but it certainly payed off, earning a few well-deserved laughs with his gauché performance. Amiah Miller gives a lovely, gentle performance. Without giving spoilers, I can only say that the story was satisfyingly tied off at last, though not exactly in the way you expect. Still, we knew from the start where we were heading. There is plenty to discuss about War, and it is my hope that more people will discover the treasure that they are. I don't quite understand it, yet there it is - audiences are largely indifferent to the trilogy, caring little and even reviewing poorly. Maybe they will gather fans over the years. I certainly hope so. The trilogy is ground-breaking in its approach to motion-capture; the story is at times chilling, at times heart-warming; the drama is real, the action is real; and most importantly, the characters are not shallow, but intriguing and developed.

411,maxigarciasoto,War for the planet of the apes - Movie review,10,25 July 2017,"When i eared that the third prequel of the planet of the apes was happening i was obviously very excited, because this planet of the apes series so far has been really good, ""Rise"" was awesome, ""Dawn"" was one my favorites movies of the year 2014. So i went to see this film and... oh my god i loved it.I'm not going to talk about the plot because this film it's one of those films that if you don't know nothing going in, you will have a really awesome cinematic experience. This film once again has Andy Serkis as Caesar AKA ""The best ape ever"" and his performance in this film it's incredible, i would nominate this guy right now for ""Best actor in a leading role"". What you have seen in ""Dawn"" it's nothing compared to what he does in ""War"".The fact that the apes are so human in this film, you watch them like if they were people, not as apes. And that is the big irony of this movie, that the apes are more human than the real humans them selves. Speaking of humans in the film, Woody Harrelson gave such a good performance that makes this villain evil and terrifying, and you understand why he think the way he does, and why he does such things to keep the human race out of the extinction.This movie featured an awesome score, breath taking visual effects, good characters, good sub plots like the young girl that appears in the poster, and the final product it's one of the best movies of 2017. It's one of the best movie trilogies of all time, so what are you waiting for? Go watch it, i'm sure that you are going to enjoy it.",War for the Planet of the Apes

This movie was a close to perfect movie, making cgi monkeys carry so much emotions, even the armed forces carry all that emotion and are not generic and it's one of few movies that have made this an emotional rollercoaster of a movie, it's a beyond spectacular movie and third addition to a brilliant trilogy.

This part was about Caesar inner struggle about his love/hate relationship toward humans. It's a very emotional movie and makes you root for the apes. Andy Serkins should take an Oscar for making you feel as if Caesar is a human with his reactions and feelings. Caesar's character is somehow rare to be found among humans. Caesar is just, fair and courageous. Fighting with honor and mercy. It's a movie worth seeing and deserves and rating of 10/10.",War for the Planet of the Apes

415,jalvarad,Another Ape Movie with plenty of special effects and little substance,4,13 August 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is another modern reboot of a sci-fi series that has entertained generations of moviegoers since its beginning in 1968. So, it is no surprise that the new reincarnation has done remarkably well at the box office. However, unless you main criterion for watching movies is the pure fascination that comes from special effects, you will certainly be disappointed by it. The movie starts basically where the previous one left it off. From that point forward, it is hard to grasp the main story-line since bits of distracting scenes are poorly woven in the fabric of the plot. Moreover, the intractable plot comes across as being too dark with themes such as revenge, punishment, and mercy killings (and suicide) that hardly make the movie entertaining unless one is easily distracted by the special effects and battle scenes that continuously take over the movie. In the end, it basically becomes clear that director Matt Reeves has little appreciation for structure and is more interested in pleasing those that have short-term memory spans and/or easily excited by eye-catching specials effects of apes' facial expressions and combat scenes. Let's hope that the next Apes' movie would have more things to offer, at least for entertainment purposes.",War for the Planet of the Apes

The ending is bogus and outright stupid. There are hardly any dialogues. The entire film is like a slideshow where characters take a lifetime to complete an action. By the end of first half, I could hear bunch of people snoring and the rest complaining why they bothered watching the film. This film deserves a Razzi.

The ensuing drama that you are then taken along with, is breathtaking, shocking, brutal and Brave! Andy Serkis and the other Actors who have mastered this unbelievable technology are magnificent, the Visuals are stunning, the shocks are unbearable, gripping and wonderfully woven into the faultless story, that grabs you, holds you and then breaks you over and over again! Naivety aside, I understand a few issues may arise, such as 'Bad Ape', the Music being a little obvious, the Little girls reactions to a couple of dramatic scenes, however none are big enough to spoil in any way a quite remarkable end to a series that has become a huge hit. Ignore those reviews that typically focus on such minor detail.So, go back and watch the Rise and Dawn of the Apes if you haven't already done so; Grab snacks and drinks, Book the film in 3D, ""Shut off from the outside world"" as 'VUE' states and witness a Masterpiece.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I love the part when Caesar and his ape allies met the little girl who can't speak and a funny ape who has been living in a cave for a long time.

It's tense, serious and caeser gets put through the mill in this along with all his family and friends, the animation is so good it simply doesn't look like CGI, it just looks totally real and you buy it from the first frame to the last. The score is great. Woody Harrelson is also excellent as always. All the ingredients are there and they largely work.Yet there's something missing. The freshness and novelty of the original. The constant, brooding moral ambiguity of the sequel that has an almost 'empire strikes back' nature to it by the end. There's no 'nooo' moment in this or the jaw dropping scene where koba shoots ceaser. It's all a bit bleak and depressing. I miss watching ceaser grow in the first movie, and the constant shift of trust and power in the second one. This movie somehow lacks those qualities to a degree. I also expected the movie to be larger in scale and scope than it was. Maybe the first two movies were so good that they raised my expectations to highly.It's still good in isolation, but I just find the first two movie more entertaining on the whole.",War for the Planet of the Apes

This one has everything.The overall environment the movie makes around is impeccable. the sound of drop of water falling, footsteps, breathing, gun shots, screams everything is so brilliantly done.CGI effects are amazing, this is one of those movies that you should only be watching in theaters not anywhere.Everyone from director Matt reeves, screenplay by bomback n reeves, Andy Serkis as Caesar the protagonist , Steve Zahn, Woody Harrelson as the antagonist all were at their very best. special mention should be reserved for Andy serkis who made a marvelous job of creating a character like Caesar, it almost resemblance jackman as the wolverine. This is a movie that should be/will be winning an Oscar for this year that's a sure thing. the third movie in this trilogy is the best of the three by more than a mile. its only seldom you get a third one so epic (Bourne ultimatum, TLOR ROK, TDKR) some mentions.If you haven't watched i don't what you are waiting for, its a must watch.

But I believe in seeing as overall prospective. Not just the message and that regards I didn't thought it wasn't absolutely awful. In this film the role of Apes can easily be replaced any terrorist organizations in the world. Even they complaint that they are fighting for survival, for protection, society made them bla bla bla. But should we allow them to eradicate mankind? Secondly world is not so small. There is a world beyond US. So I I'm confuse. Was this movie about war between Apes verses mankind or Apes verses US. To imagine that an avalanche can destroy entire humanity is laughable. At the end I was wondering where are other humans? I was certainly expecting a showdown between Apes and Mankind. But it never happened. Overall I went in to the movie expecting 10 but returned with a 6. The good thing about the film was CGI effect. It was really goo and at no point it was over done. 3D effects were good. There were some scenes that was really intense and created tension.

Within this prequel trilogy that took everyone by surprise, war does not always attack you with brute force, but rather, approaches the subject with psychological intent. ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is a prime example of that approach with our protagonist experiencing inner turmoil within himself, and his own personal ideals and beliefs. As a conclusion, it's dark, has its issues, and delivers less consistent thrills than its predecessors, but it does submerge you into its desolate world with absolute believability, spectacular special effects, an emotional score, and an always top shelf performance by Andy Serkis.

429,raa-55017,Best of the series,9,17 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is the third and last film in this rebooted franchise, following Rise (2011) and Dawn (2014), two films that I personally enjoy. I was very anticipated for this one, mainly because the last two movies had gotten me so invested in the lead ape, Caesar.This movie was surprisingly amazing, almost perfect. It follows Caesar (Andy Serkis) as he embarks on a journey of revenge against ""the Colonel"" (Woody Harrelson) after suffering many losses at human hands. One would expect loads of action in this finale, as the title is War for the Planet of the Apes. But you don't really get it. For some, that may be a huge turnoff. The movie is more of a drama and focuses on the characters instead of non-stop Michael Bay explosions, introducing a girl named Nova along with Bad Ape (Steve Zahn) to accompany Caesar and his small crew. This movie is extremely bleak, dark, and straightforward. It emotionally invests you in the characters to the point where you should be tearing up at the end. The solid core of this film is accompanied by the best score Michael Giacchino has composed to date. The tone that the music and cinematography projects is masterful. While it is bleak, Bad Ape provides lots of humor that benefits the film from being too dark. While some will scorn it for not providing the huge action set pieces that were promised in the title, War for the Planet of the Apes makes up for the lack of explosions with deep, emotional scenes that keep you riveted from start to finish.",War for the Planet of the Apes

432,Sabre-El,"Detailed, but slow and uninteresting",6,8 December 2018,"War for the Planet of the Apes picks up from where the previous two movies had left: the intelligent apes are increasing in numbers and the humans are afraid of them. Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the first installment, was a masterful piece of art. It mainly focused on two characters, Caesar, the protagonist of this movie, and his 'keeper'/friend. It was very detailed, focussing on the relationship between the two and all that fit well with how the narrative unfolded. The second installment had a similar formula of keeping the story detailed and it worked well for it was well.That's why I had a lot of hope for this movie. Unfortunately, that very formula that made me love the previous parts, just doesn't work with this one. War of the Planet of the Apes starts out just fine, but then, just in a few minutes, the story slows down a lot: each scene is very detailed, trying to give its viewers a feel of its characters. The thing is, we already know about many characters from its previous parts, so we're not that interested about that any more. Many apes haven't developed speech, so most of the movie is in sign language. While it is 'realistic' and I give plaudits to the makers for this, it adds to the slowness of the movie, making it boring, as one just can't understand what's going on. On top of all that, the movie is quite predictable. Add up all these factors and the fact that the movie runs for more than 2 hours, it becomes slightly difficult to watch. I literally had to fast forward a few scenes because I just wanted the movie to end.All that said, the movie does have its positives. The CGI is amazing and the apes really look as if they exist. The movie might be boring, but it is still a good piece of art in terms of story-telling and one can tell a lot of effort went into it.\Recommendation: don't watch it if you can't stand slow movies and don't have your hopes up based on the previous two installments",War for the Planet of the Apes

A better screenwriter could have done so much more with this premise. As it stands, this is just another example for film class on an over-reliance of technique over substance.It was impressive to see a vaguely chimpanzee face make human expressions. There are lots of micro-expressions and nuances a human viewer could appreciate. They clearly worked very hard at it. They are clearly very proud of it. But after a while the movie seemed like a demo-reel for those wizards. It is no surprise that the extras go straight into a facial CGI documentary slash fundraiser. The dialog is trite and uninspired. And this just draws attention to how far the art has to go. The uncanny valley is wide. We have not crossed o'er. The walking, running, fighting, falling, are all still campy and cartoonish.

This film was a huge surprise for me. I was expecting an okay, fun to watch blockbuster action movie with Apes and people just shooting each other for 2 hours. The film blew me away. This is by far one of the best Hollywood block buster movies I've seen in recent memory. It is jam packed with heart and emotion and is a literal emotional roller-coaster start to finish. The film touches on themes of slavery and the divide of species and draws parallels with lots of current social issues. The motion capture acting is incredible and the character models are so lifelike now that you forgot they aren't actual apes. Andy Serkis is incredible along with the other motion capture actors. Woody Harrelson's character was the weakest by far but he still feels rooted in the story and the universe of the planet of the apes.I can't even begin to understand all the terrible reviews this movie is getting on IMDb. Anyone who didn't like this has unfortunately been poisoned by the modern block buster explosions and no substance virus that has been running rampant for years.

438,eno2000,Didn't Like This,4,7 April 2018,"I saw the first two films, with the first being the best IMO. I can understand why others felt the plot was non-existent even though I disagree. There was a plot and it was multilayered and deep. I just didn't like it.The colonel was thoroughly unlikeable as expected. Trying to add complexity to his character with revelations about his own experiences that molded him didn't really help the story at all. I still disliked him and didn't care at all about his experiences since there was no justification for his behavior.I think the mistake they made with this one was going for depth. First, it's a war movie, which really doesn't warrant depth and complexity for most viewers. People who like war movies don't want literature, they want to see people ""blowing up the bad guys"".Which brings me to my second thought: they muddied the waters in terms of who the ""bad guys"" are. The only clear bad guy is the colonel. But when they get deeper into the plot, Caesar also has negative motivations, as do the apes who work with humans. With the colonel's back story and his explanation of why he wants to kill the apes, you're given a credible reason for why he is the way he is, but it doesn't make him any more likeable.My third complaint: the movie is bleak. There is absolutely no hope for humanity at all save for the little girl. I don't know if they plan to do more with the series. If they do, they will have to fill in a lot of gaps because the story where it ends in this film is completely boring. Apes found a place to call home. Now they live there... like slightly more intelligent apes. They've lost their leader and the only one let who can speak like Caesar is the comic relief ape who is a coward and a moron.So, no it wasn't plotless. The plot was just unlikable. I was lucky that this was viewed via a $.99 rental on Google Play otherwise I would have felt ripped off. If you did like it, I can't fault your opinion because it was pretty well made, it just didn't do it for me.",War for the Planet of the Apes
439,dearbornvendetta,Storytelling at it's best!,9,20 July 2017,"Let me just say, I have loved the reboots of The Planet of the Apes movies. They have been brilliantly deep, and ironically, very human movies, and I'm happy to say War For the Planet of the Apes continues this. Let's get one thing out of the way, this is not a war movie. At least not like one would expect. This is a movie about an animal that is as emotionally complex as any human. It's about Caesar, and his inner torments between being the good ape he's always tried to be, or give into vengeance. One thing I've loved about these movies is the parallels between humans and the apes. Caesar wrestles with very familiar conflicts here, and that's what makes him so interesting. He's as complex as any self proclaimed superior human and my hunch is, this might not be too far off from the truth with actual apes as well. Andy Serkis delivers yet another awesome performance. Caesar is at his most vulnerable here and Serkis really does a great job portraying that, from his voice down to his movements, the performance is Oscar worthy. Speaking of Oscar worthy, Woody Harrelson. He's always been an intriguing actor to me, he's so well rounded and so capable of playing any character you present to him. The Colonel is no exception. This is a hard nosed man who will do anything to win his battles and yet, despite it all there is some humanity to him. He comes to respect Caesar despite being on opposite sides of the battleground. The moments these two characters share are mesmerizing and each time The Colonel steps on screen, he demands your attention. As I said before, this isn't a war movie. Don't go in expecting constant bullets, spears and combat. This is a story driven movie with a story well worth watching. I highly recommend.",War for the Planet of the Apes

The visuals are beyond anything ever put on screen. Incredible. How did they do this?But what surprised me most was the story and direction. This has far more in common with the epic films of the golden age of cinema than modern movies. Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and Apocalypse Now are all evoked in this absolute masterpiece of film making.It's an amazing movie.

I never saw the 60's versions.)...Read the rest of the review at Popping' Movies: http://poppinmovies.blogspot.com/2017/07/war-for- planet-of-apes-2017.html",War for the Planet of the Apes
444,kriscgis,"Great array of apes, Well-costumed, Draws on sensitive issues",7,13 July 2017,"I enjoy Planet of the Ape films - the idea of our supposed primitive ancestors - but for the missing link - doing battle with Homo sapiens, is indeed imaginative.I like the array of Apes, from an orang-utan - who looks a bit like the Orange Dear Leader - through to some splendid silver back, ginger and 'winter' gorillas with pointed heads and looking as lovable as London Zoo's Guy the Gorilla.Amazing to see them on horseback brandishing weapons.I don't like the semi-chimp-semi-Dobby character - spoilt the film to bring in such a joke figure - but overall, the costuming is superb.It's nice to see it isn't just one action scene after another, as is so typical these days, but a gentle slow development of plot and characters.A hint of racism as the Homo sapiens bring the Apes into slavery and force them into hard labour, cutting rocks and a chain gang. Caesar leads the revolt against it, and confronts the baddie Colonel, a complete psychopath who thinks nothing of killing his own men and family members, and suddenly we get a blast of Jimi Hendrix soundtrack!This is all very smashing, but the comparison with Black struggles is unmistakable.For this, and because it is a little over-long, I can only manage seven stars.One of the better films this year so far.",War for the Planet of the Apes
445,liloiax,"Can't get enough of those ""damn dirty apes""!!!",7,23 January 2021,"In all 3 movies of the trilogy (Rise, Dawn and War) I'm in constant amazement of how lifelike all the apes, gorillas and orangutans look. Sometimes I was so distracted by how great they looked that I forgot to read the subtitles to know what all of them (except Caesar who can talk) were actually saying. Believe it or not, you could figure out what they're saying just by their body language which is another incredibly impressive task done by the actors behind the CGI; as well af the animators too.
However, I just didn't find the story as good as ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"".Not like he needs another compliment bc literally everybody has already said he'd done an amazing job in these 3 movies but I just have to say it myself... Andy Serkis did an AMAZING job portraying Caesar in the trilogy. He might have even deserved an Oscar for his commitment to his performance. Sometimes you'll legitimately forget that your NOT watching real apes on your screen. I know I'm guilty of that a few times too lol.",War for the Planet of the Apes
446,kamenhaven,Caesar becomes a passive character in this disappointing end to the Apes trilogy,4,29 July 2017,"The first 30 mins of the movie was, hands-down, the best 30 mins of a movie I've seen this year. Epic, intense, emotional and full of gravitas, I was like ""No movie this year has made me feel this emotionally connected to a character."" The dramatic weight and stakes were palpable and felt earned. I thought to myself, if the movie is like this the whole way, this is going to be a masterpiece. This could be one of the best films of the year.Sadly, the movie went progressively downhill from that point onwards. Without getting into spoilers, the movie only became somewhat interesting once the premise switched to an army encampment. However the movie took so long to get there the story could have been benefited by excising long, needless scenes introducing new characters (who add absolutely nothing to the story anyway!) Instead, what we got was a bloated runtime and several narrative decisions that deeply undermined the integrity and intelligence of the main character. My biggest disappointment with War of the Planet of the Apes is that you never feel the resourcefulness and brilliance of Caesar as was first depicted in Rise. There, he was smart and always a step ahead of everyone else, which was how he became such a great leader. In here, Caesar is mostly depicted in a passive role, where things mostly happened to him without him seizing any real agency in the plot. It makes no sense bcoz he is our main protagonist. As a result, the dramatic weight of the ending feels unearned bcoz its emotional impact is completely dependent upon you buying him as a strong and protective leader driven to extreme measures of selflessness, traits which the movie unfortunately fails to depict.Also, the title may be misleading to those who are expecting an action-packed epic finish to the trilogy. Whatever intense action there is in the army encampment (in a set-piece hearkening back to the one in Rise) is diminished by prolonged scenes of clunky exposition. The movie always feels like its building up to something big and exciting but never does, and feels like a wet blanket.Personally, knowing the place where Caesar and the apes go to by the end, a part of me feels like the movie would have been better as a chase movie. Where it becomes a road movie and the apes are being tracked and hunted down while getting to some place. It would have been more interesting and made more sense for the story. Instead the movie got bogged down at a single place, going nowhere and ultimately undercutting any chances the franchise had at being one of the best trilogies of all time.",War for the Planet of the Apes
447,perval,War for the Planet of the Apes is a near perfect film with great performances and complex characters,9,19 August 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is very close to be a masterpiece.The movie exceeded my expectations and is even better than the previous movie in the trilogy which was incredibly good.This film is the definition of epic!The film has a very dark tone that is similar to The Dark Knight trilogy( I don't say it steals from it I just say it has a similar tone).War for the Planet of the Apes has great effects,a beautiful score by Micheal Giacchino,an interesting,character driven story with complex,three dimensional characters and some incredible performances.The characters as I mentioned are complex and developed(mostly Caesar and the antagonist the Colonel).Almost all of the characters in the film are dark and serious except one ape who serves as the comic relief in the film.His character was a risk because normally in such a dark movie a character like this would feel forced but he was lovable and was a nice addition to the overall film.Caesar's character was incredible,well developed and his decisions had impact to the story.The antagonist was also very interesting and his actions were justified by his backstory.The acting in the film was amazing.The motion captured performances by the supporting cast were very good.As I mentioned the performance of Woody Harrelson was unbelievable and the best performance in the film was Andy Serkis as Caesar.His motion capture performance was incredible and it was Oscar worthy.In a Nutshell War of the Planet of the Apes is near perfect with breathtaking visuals,great music,mind blowing performances and a character driven story with complex,three dimensional characters",War for the Planet of the Apes
448,29Vishnoi29,BEST SERIES EVER 🔥🔥❤❤😍😍,10,1 June 2020,BEST MOVIE EVER AND AFTER WATCHED THIS MOVIE I AM EMOTIONALLY SAD 😢😢,War for the Planet of the Apes
449,jippy33,Emotional roller-coaster of the year,10,12 October 2017,"First of all, this movie is a victim of audience expectations and bad marketing. You would think this was the ape vs human version of Saving Private Ryan when looking at the trailers. It is not. It is a 140-minute drama about family, grief, survival and war. It is a bold move for a franchise that has been all CGI and action.Sure, there is hardly a scene without CGI (since there is hardly a scene without an ape) and the movie is bookended by great action set pieces. But the roughly hour-and-a-half in the middle is a journey, both literally and metaphorically. The emotional depth that is displayed by the primary characters with very little dialogue is astounding and very rare in this genre. I was shattered after this movie was done, so invested in the characters, so overjoyed by their victories and grief-stricken by their hardships. And the amazing cinematography only strengthens the depth of every scene. Throw in quite a bit of humor as well and you have a drama for the ages.Special mention has to be given Amiah Miller. She has not a single line of dialogue, yet struck every chord of the emotional spectrum as the sole human amongst all the apes. The journey of a child, left alone only to find a new home in the most unlikely place of all is an amazing tearjerker when acted and shot this well.There are some tropes here and there that made me roll my eyes a bit. You have the odd ex-machina and what not. It still does not stop me from dishing out my first IMDb 10 in 2017.",War for the Planet of the Apes
450,timoschott-07241,Great ending to one of the best trilogies,8,29 April 2021,"Great overall package. There were no clear weaknesses.The visual effects were absolutely stunning. I could hardly imagine that all was cgi.The movie totally drew me in. Which happens rarely. You really like part of the story. The story had everything from great action, deep moral, comedy. The only thing I would like to point out is that Harrllsons acting in the first few scenes seems kinda strange.",War for the Planet of the Apes

The CGI is amazing and how it's woven into the spectacular camera work, is a true work of art. This trilogy was an epic and I can't think of a better way to end such a good set of films. I've seen people give this a 1, and I don't know how. Don't listen to the hate and give this movie a shot. It's a must watch for people that enjoyed the other two, or for those who are just in need of a good movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes
452,rushmoras,What should have been an awesom culimanation became an average conclusion,6,8 April 2018,"If by reading the title ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" you think that this movie will be about war for survival of Ceasar's clan, you would be right only 20 percent. The whole war aspect in the movie maybe half an hour long (the beginning and towards the end). Rest of the movie viewers watch how advanced species of apes thoughtfully look at each other, use sign language, save a kid, travel a lot, get captured, work in a quasi-concentration camp, get rescued from the quasi-concentration camp and then go to war against the nasty humans (who, according to Woody Harllson's character, just want to survive the new strain of the virus, which infected the humans in 1st and 2nd movies by... I don't know, enslaving and/or killing the apes, because the humans think that... um... the less the apes are there, the better chance for the virus not to spread? I don't know exactly, because I did not understand the motivation (maybe that's my problem)). Personally, the movie did not catch my interest in the slightest, while the previous chapters were engaging. This movie, not so much. It has a very slow pacing, and in my opinion, it should have been a sci-fi drama (that would be a correct genre for it). While it's not an awful movie, but it certainly lacks something, which would make it good. Or maybe I watched it not in the right mood, maybe, if I would rewatch it after some time, I would change my mind, but for now, I rate it 6/10 (just a movie out of bunch out there).",War for the Planet of the Apes
453,dvmb65,"Forgive me Lawgiver, they have sinned.",5,9 August 2017,"Lots of drama. Internal ape conflict. Human ape conflict. Brutal, but not interesting. I still want to like this movie, but I can't make the leap. Humanity has been whittled away by some super virus, yet look at what remains. I could have taken some of it, but the final battle was too much. You had helicopters, tanks, missiles and helicopters. You probably had a force larger than what I thought the surviving population of the earth was. Forget it, I really can't get over it. Sorry.",War for the Planet of the Apes
454,saynt614,Great way to end the Trilogy,9,18 July 2017,"This was a great final entry to the Apes Trilogy.The story was fantastic, the CGI and motion capture is insanely good. Andy Serkis needs an Oscar nod for this work on these films. It's kind of funny that a movie with WAR in the title ends up NOT being an action film, it does have some heart pounding moments of action but only a few. The rest focuses on Caesar and his struggle with becoming like Koba from the first two entries. It revolves around him getting revenge for most of the movie.The middle of the film does slow down quite a bit to develop The Colonel and the Humans with their struggle of the mutated virus. It paints them as a rebel group who are disobeying orders of their commanding officers in the north. This results in a war between the two Human Factions with the Apes caught in the middle of it. It leads to an interesting final act that closes well and probably the book on any more Apes movies.Overall it was a great film. I enjoyed the hell out of it. 9/10 One point knocked off for being a bit too long. Other than that. Great movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Growing up watching the 2nd remake (2001, and all of them are bull dung), and later on watch the original (the original are masterpieces), now I find this trilogy amazing. People complain there is no ""war"". Oh cmon, this is not like call of duty war, or Destiny war, this is evolution war, this is mental war. It is serious on so many level that the movie doesn't talk about war is just people shoot people, people shoot apes or apes shoot ape, this is the movie about mental pain (ceaser's family is killed), PTSD (ceaser keeps seeing the ghost of Koba), and metal fight (ceaser keeps fighting back his own will of revenge). This movie is touchy on so many level and the more I watch it, the more I feel fascinating about how the director can put so many content in just like 2h of watching. Truly masterpiece, in my opinion, this movie deserve 7/10 for some rush action and plot hole, but I have vowed to give any ape movie 9/10 so here you go.

456,niallmaggs,The third is easily the best! - Film Review By Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com),10,5 January 2018,"War for the Planet of the Apes is the third entry into the new rebooted Planet of the Apes series, following our main character Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his companions as they fight a war with the humans.The reboot trilogy is one of the best ever made, and can easily be ranked up there with The Dark Knight series and Lord of the Rings. They're so well crafted with excellent, modern CGI that looks unbelievably realistic and authentic.Expectations were extremely high considering the two surprisingly brilliant predecessors, and it definitely delivers on every level with excellent action sequences, interesting character development, elements of comedy, and emotion.The plot was extremely thought provoking and manages to create a conflict between good and evil, and gives us a balance of who is in the wrong? the Apes, or the humans? This is done so effectively as the audience will change and alter their opinion from side to side multiple times as characters express their argument, like who started it? who is being more brutal and ruthless? these questions are brought up throughout the film, making the audience question even their own opinion! This is evidence of excellent direction from Matt Reeves!Andy Serkis as Caesar is phenomenal, he gives the audience someone to root for while also appearing badass and intimidating. He's clearly into the role and it shows through his adaptable voice acting for different situations, bringing out a variation of emotion from the audience and that shows what a brilliant, underrated actor he is.Woody Harrelson as the Colonel is scary and intimidating, he is cruel and heartless, which is excellent writing, making the audience hate him with a passion, is expertly done. Woody is excellent, and gives us an evil portrayal of a despicable, deranged psychopath.The other stand out performance was from Amiah Miller. She is absolutely great in this role, and at such a young age, she shows great promise in acting. Her performance was so original and realistic, and not stereotypical in any way, as her character is complex, which enhances the overall feel and tone of the movie.The pacing was slightly inconsistent in the second act, as it did drag a little bit in parts, but the first and third acts really make up for the small pacing issue that really doesn't affect the film much anyway!The score by Michael Giacchino is intense and powerful, and the editing was consistent and smooth, and wasn't jarring (thankfully!) The digital shooting and production is realistic but fantastical, which creates a brilliant cinema-going and transcendent experience!The script was good as always, and includes sections of humour that lightens the dark tone. It's also entertaining and fun, and the dialogue between the characters is tense in situations, but also light hearted and comedic!
Overall, War for the Planet of the Apes is one of the best movies of the year, and takes you on an emotional, heart breaking journey that closes this masterful trilogy perfectly, and one that will stay with you for a very long time.",War for the Planet of the Apes
457,criticadelcinema,A moving culmination of our generation's greatest trilogy.,10,19 July 2017,"Man, I can always tell if a series is great if I get that empty feeling when it comes to a close. With that being said—this is one of the most gripping, emotional films I've seen all year, serving as a fitting bookend for Mark Reeves' outstanding series of Apes movies. This is a bit of an unorthodox ending to a trilogy. Instead of aiming for the overblown action spectacle that usually close these things out, War for delivers a deeply moving, character driven story. That might turn some viewers off from the film, especially because the marketing behind this movie—and even the title—creates certain expectations. While this could be disappointing, the film is so effective on an emotional level that you can forgive it for it's lack of constant action. War for definitely benefits from the two previous films when it comes to character development, specifically the development of protagonist Caesar. Caesar is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters ever put to film. We have seen him go from orphaned infant, to budding revolutionary, to thoughtful leader, and now; extremely weary general. This slow buildup of character depth makes the completion of his arc truly captivating. When tragedy strikes, you care. When good favor comes his way, you care. If we talk about Caesar, we have to talk about the man behind the ape. Andy Serkis has done a marvelous job portraying every stage of Caesar's life through motion capture in these films, and his performance is just as amazing here. It would be a tragedy if Serkis doesn't at the very least get a Oscar nomination for his performance here. The emotion that is conveyed through the eyes and voice of Serkis' performance is far superior than most ""real human"" acting performances this year. If Serkis deserves an Oscar for his performance, than the visual effects team definitely deserves one as well. The CGI of the apes is simply flawless. Director Matt Reeves makes a point of shooting the apes close up, really putting the outstanding work this effects team did on showcase.Not only is this the most visually polished film of the trilogy, this is the most beautifully shot film I've seen all year. From beginning to end, Reeves puts together poignant sequences that rely almost exclusively on visuals. There are many historic visual allusions here, ranging from shots reminiscent of the Trail of Tears to Holocaust symbolism. The allegory presented combined with the emotional investment in these characters, creates some truly heart- wrenching moments. One element that I thought didn't work as well in the previous movies were the human characters. Woody Harrelson flips this trend on it's head with an excellent performance here as the Colonel. Not only is the Colonel the most villainous human character of the series, he is the most complex human character of this trilogy. I can talk on and on about how much I love this movie, but instead I'll let the stars speak for themselves. Just go see this.War for the Planet of the Apes pulls absolutely no punches, delivering a powerful conclusion to one of the greatest trilogies ever made. All aboard the Andy Serkis Oscar train.",War for the Planet of the Apes
458,jaka6052,Disappointment,5,14 October 2017,"Lets start of with the good things: The CGI were outstanding. Never seen something like this ever. You can watch the movie just for that. If you subtract the CG then there is really not much left. The story is simple and doesn't make much sense in general. The movie tries way to hard to appear intellectual, but every thought provoking intend is nothing more than a bland copy of Apocalypse Now and Schindlers List. The movie takes itself way too serious. That in my eyes is the main problem. The older movies didn't do this. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind a drama movie in this series but if you go the depth of Schindlers List, you better deliver. Then we have all this things happening that have don't add any value to the story. No development, no exchange, we learn nothing about our hero. Just a new character gets added to group. Then ending was probably the worst part. I can't explain how this was greenlit. Every little bit of depth the movie had until the last 10min will be gone by the end of it. To sum it up: + CGI - StoryNo recommendation from me.",War for the Planet of the Apes
459,Tom_the_Bomm,Your Favorite Day-time Soap....With Apes!,2,20 April 2020,"I know what you're thinking, I'm the horrible ignorant reviewer that the 10-star reviewers have warned you about. I'm that guy who slams a film for no other reason than it disagrees with my political/religious views. I assure you that is not the case, at least with this film. I rated this film 2/10 because it is exactly the type of Weinstein-era Hollywood output you would expect to win Oscars. And that's bad.While there were some well done aspects of the film, such as visuals and music, these were all the technical aspects of the film, not the meat and potatoes of the story; or, what the primary purpose of a film should be to tell. However, these factors earn the film a 2/10 rating instead of 1/10. But the rest of the movie was bunk.First, the title is practically perjury. The film had perhaps a couple VERY brief action scenes in it, and was in no way the war epic promised by the trailers. In fact, it would have been better to swap titles of this one and the second of the trilogy; this one was far more ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" than a war, and the second one was far more a war then this one. What you do get is a 140 minute long soap opera about the poor apes that are abused and held captive by the evil, militaristic humans. Which brings me to my next criticism, the depiction of the humans.The humans are shown to be cruel soldiers, led by the crazed Woody Harrelson (who know how to eat canned peaches like a boss), who are an evil blight on the face of the earth. The humans only care about themselves, and are such violent creatures that they kill each other even when faced with extinction, a depiction so contrary to basic human instinct it's hair-pulling bad. Yet somehow the apes aren't, even when scientific study has shown that apes (especially chimpanzees) are just as violent as man, or even more so, ripping each other apart and cannibalizing. What the director Matt Reeves was trying to say with this inversion of values is lost on me. Maybe He's just trying to defend his kind.Another strange point of this film is the anti-American sentiment. One scene in particular comes to mind, where the poor apes are corralled into a chain-link prison compound by the evil humans, all while the American National Anthem is playing (A song that symbolizes freedom). Whether Matt Reeves was trying to make an ironic statement about America's unjust imprisonment of rapists and murderers I don't know, but I do hope he's smarter than that. Additionally the evil human leader ""The Colonel"" (his name?) is a Christian/Catholic man; no surprise there, Hollywood condemns any religion that doesn't endorse healing crystals or a pilgrimage to Mecca. The prison compound for the apes is supposed to mirror a concentration camp, because as everyone knows imprisoning apes is a comparable evil to murdering millions of actual people. Honestly, now that I think of it, there was no real reason as to why they shouldn't just kill the ugly monkeys. Unless of course, they needed them to build their wall (since by 2016, building walls has been deemed an evil activity partaken in only by the depraved). Oh yeah, and there's this positively execrable monkey named the ""Bad Ape"", definitely a reason for skipping. I should probably stop before I convince myself to downgrade this to a 1/10. But you know all you need to know. It's a horrible movie, I dare you to waste 140 minutes of your life to this.I used to trust Rotten Tomatoes before this. Now I don't. You shouldn't either.",War for the Planet of the Apes
460,joshbaileynch,A Damp Squib,5,17 July 2017,"This film starts with a fantastic action set-piece as humans battle apes in a Vietnam-War-movie-style jungle fire-fight. There's real tension in the build-up and then a genuinely exciting burst of action which sets up huge expectations for what will follow. Sadly, this is the film's high-point and from then on the narrative descends into a remarkably sentimental monkey soap opera. The CGI is certainly extraordinary, especially in the close ups of CG characters - in tight framings the apes really do have a photographic realism to them. The performances are generally good too, whether live action or as a product of performance capture. It seems a real shame, then, that the narrative slips into such clichéd mawkishness - something particularly evident in the action linked to 'Nova' - a mute human child adopted by the apes to demonstrate (rather clumsily) that the simians are a lot more forgiving and unprejudiced than the horrible human race. There's also the inexplicable introduction of a weird kind of Gollum-monkey; a grey, alopecia- ridden, wide-eyed gumby of a chimp that appears to be there mainly for laughs, though you'd be forgiven for not getting the joke most of the time. One can't help feeling that Andy Serkis (whose Imaginarium Studios were behind the CGI performances) just can't shake off his Lord-of-the- Rings days.Ultimately, though, the biggest flaw in the film is its failure to deliver on the title's promise. This is far more jaw-jaw than war- war and the film tends to lack the punch and grit that it needs.Having said all that, there are things to like here and if you enjoyed the first two instalments, then I would certainly suggest you give this a go; just don't believe the hype claiming this is the best in the trilogy - in fact that accolade still belongs to the first in the franchise.",War for the Planet of the Apes
461,alex_ijk,Rating is biased!! Wasted potential and filming resources!,1,16 October 2017,"SUCH A WASTED POTENTIAL AND FILMING RESOURCES! Where do I begin... here is a chronological list of failures: *SPOILERS AHEAD* 1. Movie begins with a battle between apes and the bad General's (Woody H.) army. Apes live their quiet lives in the forest and are suddenly attacked. How were they found?? I guess it's nice to start a movie with a battle...2. During the above battle the apes capture two soldiers and Caesar sets them free. As a response the General personally comes to Caesar's home in the mountains (with helicopters) and kills his family. What?? Why? It doesn't make sense. They don't even talk.3. The scene happens in the middle of the night when all apes are asleep. Caesar wakes up (only him, maybe he has a sixth *sense*), sees a rope in the waterfall, obviously someone is coming. Sensible thing to do was to cut the rope and wake everybody up, BUT INSTEAD, he quietly and slowly circles around the house, and when he returns to the waterfall he discovers his family killed by the General. No logic! 4. Later on we learn that this General's main agenda is actually a war against other remaining humans. So why spend resources on haunting the apes?? 5. Caesar gets upset, takes a few companions and goes for revenge, while all the other apes go a different way to find a safe place.6. In the meantime the General with his army goes to the north and by *accident* his path is crossed with the other apes (not Caesar), the apes are taken hostage and they are used to build a wall. Why build a wall?? What for?? It's never explained.7. In the meantime Caesar with his companions find a talking ape (also by *accident*) who lives alone in the middle of nowhere, who somehow knows the base where the General went. Amazing.8. Caesar gets captured and tortured again and again, then the General explains why he fights with the other humans: It's because they want to cure the virus with medical science but the General doesn't believe in this way. Shocking. It's like *I don't believe in medical science every one should die!*. C'mon! WTH?? 9. Suddenly, near movie end, the General gets the virus and can't speak so he commits suicide. What?? C'mon! Couldn't he live just a few more hours to witness the final battle between his army and the rest of humans?? 10. Final battle begins, helicopters come, humans are fighting each other, missiles, explosions, bullets flying everywhere - but our hero is injured by an arrow. Arrow?? Really? Why would a soldier come with a bow and arrows to a battlefield filled with guns and bazookas? It DOESN'T make ANY sense! 11. Our hero bleeds out and dies (by the arrow).What an AWFULLY SAD accord for what could have been a wonderful trilogy! :(",War for the Planet of the Apes
462,meeks2003,Very disappointed...,5,22 October 2017,"There was no war almost at all, but that's not a problem. The problem was very slow scenes, ˝dialogues˝ and plot development. Actually there was not much of a story also. Harrelson was great as a colonel, but just very less used as a great actor and an important character in the movie. This emotional Caeser-scenes were so long and boring. No drama, no humor, no tensions and after all no war. Actually, if I overthink, the movie is disaster, especially because all previous movies were very good.",War for the Planet of the Apes
463,Sparse,A Poetic Final Chapter,8,27 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes isn't the masterpiece I hoped it'd be. As someone deeply invested in the characters however, it's still a highly satisfying, emotionally- profound final chapter for the trilogy. War also compensates for its relative lack of allegory/social commentary with an intricately complex (and rather poetic) character/story structure, adding new merits to the franchise even if dissatisfying others. I've been studying/writing about the entire Planet of the Apes franchise for the month leading up to my first viewing of War. Down the line (probably when the director's commentary comes out), I'll revisit my thoughts. For now, here are my impressions.Matt Reeves returns from Dawn with equitable ambition, making this the best-directed of the trilogy, addressing all of my primary issues from the previous film. Most notably, the pacing is better than Dawn's, with the emotional core always at the forefront and never sidelined. This film still doesn't have the unrelenting momentum of Rise, but it never dragged for me, and felt shorter than 2 hours (as opposed to the 2+ hour runtime). This was enhanced by the riveting (but admittedly sparse) action sequences, especially one not far into the film, which had me on edge. The sense of scope was far more realized in this film, venturing through different landscapes while not feeling claustrophobic, and implying a massive new world of unknown territory. Overall this was an ambitious film, but it didn't innovate from Dawn as Dawn innovated from Rise- -at the time shooting in the mud and rain, now opting for a tamer, snowy environment.Visually, this is nothing short of a spectacle. The (borderline R-rated) Holocaust imagery is genuinely haunting and unsettling, and crafts a unique tone with the sci-fi premise. Chinlund's production design is more enthralling than Dawn's, even if more greenscreen was used to get the result, contradicting the ambitious physical sets from before. The cinematography by Seresin also improves here, achieving some rather interesting shots, if still less engaging than the symbolic photography from Rise. As for the CG, I'm blown away. As good as the previous films were, there were still moments in which the effects were noticeably computer-generated. In War. . . the effects are flawless--so seamless that I never once actually saw ""CGI"". The effects in here are no less than groundbreaking. Spectacle isn't everything though, as there were various, smaller directorial flaws woven throughout.For one, the title card didn't match the style of the first two films, and the highlights of the former films' titles felt shoehorned-in. Also consider the distracting Coke truck in the middle of nowhere, and the ridiculously thin layers of snow covering the tunnels. How much effort would it have taken to show the characters digging or mining through stone? I can mostly excuse these smaller flaws on merits of the meticulously- crafted story.This is the sole film of the trilogy which wasn't written or adapted from a draft by Rick Jaffa/Amanda Silver, who retrospectively had a better understanding of the franchise's allegorical implications than Reeves/Bomback (who wrote this film). Now, Reeves knows how to create a brilliantly-layered story (not sure about Bomback), but his efforts left much to be desired in the way of commentary/allegory. There are clear (and often brutal) allusions to the Holocaust, with depictions of scapegoating minorities for predicaments the accuser is guilty of. In the way of contemporary commentary, the humans are trying to build a wall which ultimately proves useless (remind you of anything?). All in all though, it doesn't reflect the series' core allegory of racism very well, presenting nothing especially insightful or impressive. The final culprits are a handful of ""Did they really just do that?"" plot conveniences, mainly the tunnels with conveniently placed holes, but where the writing actually thrives in this film is structure.In War, we're presented with an abundance of reversals/reflections on the former films' themes. Consider that for the first time since Rise, Caesar finds himself in a cage and inciting a revolution. We also see him abused with water, and fed slop. Also consider the dramatic irony/poetic justice of the virus: designed by humans, activating the speech centers/enhancing intelligence for apes, now doing the precise opposite for humans, effectively switching their roles in a quite literal interpretation of Planet of the Apes' core reversal. Additionally, Alpha Omega isn't just an easter egg--it's about this film as the end of a trilogy and the beginning of a vast mythology, accentuating the motifs within the film.Character structure in War is also impressive. For example, Caesar kills Nova's father. This draws a parallel between Caesar and the Colonel (who previously killed Caesar's family). This turn not only reflects Caesar's disillusionment with humanity, but incites another parallel with his former opponent, Koba. Note that the now-orphaned Nova is a reflection of young Caesar, growing up and learning to sign with the reverse species. The performances are strong all-around, and there's not much new to be said (also I'm butting heads with IMDb's word limit). I'll add that I really enjoyed the tragic/comedic character of Bad Ape, and that Serkis was brilliant yet again.I still find Doyle's score for Rise to be the best of the trilogy, but Giacchino manages a noticeable improvement from his work on Dawn. Though still simple in orchestration, the music feels far more realized/developed here, and some nice new themes are added to the fold. I would have liked to hear more Goldsmith sensibilities (and Doyle's themes), but what we got was fantastic nonetheless.Not long after screening this film, I wanted to watch it again. Had this movie integrated more intelligent commentary and allegorical content, this could have been the second masterpiece within the Apes franchise, next to the 1968 film. I just hope that Fox keeps their damn dirty paws off my Apes until there's another story worth telling.Score: 9/10",War for the Planet of the Apes

465,noah52697,War for the Planet of the Apes,10,13 July 2017,"It's sort of rare, nowadays, to get a solid film trilogy with all Cinematic Universes studios are trying to get off the ground. And in that trilogy, it is also rare to get some of the best action ever put to screen. And it is even more rare for that Trilogy to have some of the best, well rounded, grounded characters ever. War for the Planet of the Apes is the final chapter in the rebooted Apes franchise, and F**K ME it's perfect. The story is simple, yet delivered in an intriguing and interesting manner. The visual effects are flawless; hell, I almost thought I was looking at real apes acting. The music, haunting. Almost like John Williams' Schindler's List soundtrack. AND THE ACTING—OH MY GOD —THE ACTING. Andy Serkis DESERVES an Oscar for his role as Caesar, a character who struggles with demons and personal issues. Woody Harrelson plays a scary-ass villain and even Steve Zahn, who is the comic relief, does such a good job playing Bad Ape that comparing him to the lord of stupidity, Jar Jar Binks, will be considered a sin. The pace-astounding. The writing-amazing. The direction-PERFECTION. Matt Reeves will become a great director and he definitely knows what he is doing. I want to give this movie an 11/10 but that would be ridiculous. 10/10. Watch it, then watch it again.",War for the Planet of the Apes

467,badmanlykme,"""Apes Together Strong""",10,16 July 2017,"This is the conclusion to the so far great trilogy and War for the Planet of the Apes does not disappoint, although it my be slower and a lot less action than the previous movies it focuses more on the apes than ever and gives each ape a purpose and makes you feel for them in times of need. The special effects and CGI is better than ever you almost feel like these apes are real from the the movement to the texture and the environments that surround them are enhanced and put together masterfully.The addition of Woody Harrelson's character as the Colonel added a sense of real conflict and he wasn't just ominous villain because we as viewers understand where he is coming from, he is fighting to protect the human race although he does some dark and sinister things he has a reason. Another bright spot was the introduction of Bad Ape who caused some major laughs to come from the audience and the way they balanced a comic relief character in a dark movie has to be praised.The first act of this movie is undeniably the best its fast moving there's a bit of action there is tension and conflict and it gives Ceaser a reason to set out on his mission. Ceaser is also old and broken and has had enough of the humans and is struggling to cope with is hate for the humans, it is the perfect arc for his character at this time we have see him grow from a smart intelligent chimp to a life size ape leader and figure so to see Ceaser struggle makes for some true entertainment.Although this movie has many great things it still does have some negatives unfortunately those being that the pacing in the second act drags a little and it lost some steam and some things that happened in the movie felt convenient, also the movie was very long and there were scenes that I felt could be cut out. It still is a fitting end to a great trilogy and will be remembered for years to come.",War for the Planet of the Apes
468,henryluck,War for the Planet of the Apes Review: The war to end all wars,10,17 July 2017,"War for the planet of the Apes is a magnificent achievement in direction and storytelling in the 21st century. Written and directed be the extremely talented Matt Reeves, War for the Planet of the Apes concludes an excellent trilogy on a very high note but also stands out as it's own film as well.Set two years after the events of the previous instalment in the trilogy Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the film follows the ape leader Caesar and his tribe of apes as they are still fighting against the human military. After suffering heavy casualties in his tribe, Caesar begins to have dark hallucinations of the previous film's antagonist Koba and his descend into anger and darkness, tempting Caesar to travel down the same path. We understand Caesar's anger due to the brutal fight scenes and horrific treatment of apes that are captured in the film. This is one of the many great things that this film captures beautifully. Other great moments in the film show multiple confrontations between Caesar and the film's main antagonist known simply as The Colonel played by Woody Harrison. During these confrontations, we understand why The Colonel is capturing the Apes and treating them in such horrific manner. Moments such as those really help to make the film extremely thought-provoking and creates a theme of sacrificing for the greater good. This is made even better by the fact that you don't need to do any catching up on the previous films in the trilogy to understand the plot.Speaking of the action scenes, they are beautifully directed and are extremely beefy due to the Dolby Atmos mix. Explosions are beefy, guns crack like lightening and the setting of the snowy military base really help to make use of the theme of war. What I also liked about this film, is that the CGI looked real constantly throughout the film, therefore making me emotionally connect with the Apes.Voice acting is also incredibly solid too. We understand Caesar's struggle through his tired and battle-worn voice given by Andy Serkis, proving that Andy Serkis is a superb fit for the character of Caesar.I saw this film in 3D but unfortunately, the 3D isn't much to write home about. Despite a few moments where the 3D stands out, there really isn't enough to make you warrant paying extra for that 3D screening.Overall like I said earlier, all these reasons are why War for The Planet of The Apes is not only a superb end to an excellent trilogy, but also an amazing film in it's own right. You'll be bananas to pass it up! 9.5/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
469,kbveggies,"Ape wears jacket, is funny",5,29 July 2017,"The film was just not for me, honestly. The concept of the Simian Flu mutating and rendering human survivors mute was interesting, but was poorly integrated into the film. The ""rules"" of the virus were inconsistent throughout the movie. If Woody Harrelson's Colonel spends most of his time in the proximity of imprisoned apes, the cause of the virus, why didn't he contract it sooner? Why did he only feel the effects of the Simian Flu after coming into contact with a doll infected by Nova, a mute human friend of the apes? If infected humans can only spread the virus, what infected them?The film's technical aspects were also disappointing. Besides some decent performances from Andy Serkis and Woody Harrelson, the acting was not very good overall. Gabriel Chavarria was too smug for his own good in his portrayal of Preacher, while Steve Zahn's portrayal of Bad Ape was mildly charming, yet mostly unnecessary to the plot.The musical score was a mixed bag for me. Cinematography was nothing special.It's not a horrible film, but I don't really recommend seeing it.",War for the Planet of the Apes

The look of the movie was excellent. The apes looked great, and I liked the forest environments. As some other reviewers have pointed out, I am a bit mixed at how us humans are portrayed as violent jerks. Maybe this is accurate. Oh well, it is just a science fiction movie anyways.My biggest complaint was not with the movie but some under-13-year-old (it is a PG-13 rated movie) who ended up sitting next to my wife and I and had one of those frozen Slurpee drinks. PARENTS, teach your youngsters that you can't keep sucking air on the straw when you are getting towards the end of the drink! It is impolite and rude to others around you. Let the drink melt first. Dang, this kid went on for a half-hour at least. I guess I am just too much of a wimp to yell at some strange kid next to me who was probably around 10-years old. I hope this did not affect my movie rating as it is not the movie's fault for this distraction. But it did distract me enough to miss the part where the Colonel explains to Caesar why he does what he does. Grrrrrr!",War for the Planet of the Apes

Its an epic masterpiece & a great way to end the trilogy of this wonderful franchise. The story is so well developed & directed brilliantly by Matt Reeves who is going to make the next batman movie..he is an incredible director. There is not a single scene which feels out of place. The main highlight here is the live motion capture work of the apes...it is perfect! Hats off to the genius technicians and all those wonderful actors who have acted as the apes. Special mention to Andy Serkis who plays the protagonist- Ceaser. Its a great cinematic feat! The villain played by Woody Harrelson was fantastic. Also the photography is splendid in the film....some of the shots are breathtaking. Visual effects and action scenes were spectacular...there is an avalanche scene in climax which is jaw dropping. Lastly the Background music is superb and adds depth to the scenes. The success of the film is that it perfectly balances good story telling along with the stunning visual effects which is rare to see in movies of this scale.,War for the Planet of the Apes

474,excavator,Still going strong,8,8 December 2017,"War for the planet of the apes is the third part of the latest Planet of the Apes franchise, which, if you have to believe the reviews, is either a masterpiece or a complete load of crap.After watching the movie, I find myself in a more neutral position. What I like the most about this movie is the incredible CGI and, if I may say so, the humour. In my opinion, both 'Dawn' and 'Rise' where rather dramatic. War isn't exactly a comedy either, but it has way more winks and gimmicks in it that, even though the apes are fighting for survival, allows for a smile here and there. On the other hand, it's not a Pulitzer prize winning story, so the plot isn't that astonishing and you have to agree to disagree here and there. In my opinion though, the pro's outweighed the con's, so all in all, I enjoyed this movie.If you're wondering to watch this movie, ask yourself if you ever liked the original movie, the remake or it's two prequels. If yes, go ahead, if no, don't bother, you won't like this one either.",War for the Planet of the Apes
475,skelyrata,It wasn't what I expected! It was way better!,10,14 July 2017,"When I walked into the theater to watch War for the Planet of the Apes I was expecting a two hours war movie. My expectations were high, very high. I was expecting the kind of a war movie that Revenge of the Sith failed to gave us. But I was surprised, because I was seeing another kind of movie, a superior movie, a film way better that what I was expecting. This doesn't happen very often. This movie is very emotional, very spiritual. And it works in every aspect. I mean every second is perfect. I found it flawless.This is the best third movie of a series I have seen since Indiana Jones and Last Crusade. In fact this Planet of the Apes film series is the best trilogy I remember since Indiana Jones and maybe Lethal Weapon in the 90's.If they stop here, and make no more films, I will be happy to have the box set in my private collection. If they make more of these movies, I hope they can match the quality of the story telling of War of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn and Rise.",War for the Planet of the Apes
476,sevastokrator,Coming from a Fan: Total Disappointment,3,16 July 2017,"To me, the banality of the film is insulting. I don't know with which sequel to compare it first, with Highlander II or The Matrix Revolutions.Although both Rise and Dawn had their flaws, I wasn't going to nitpick because I loved the films so much that I kept turning on the suspension of disbelief whenever necessary. So I really didn't expect that War could in any way disappoint me if they only kept the pace. But I was wrong. The story was poor, plot unconvincing, characters not developed enough and with idiotic motives and behavior, ""dramatic"" scenes lacking any maturity whatsoever.Despite the fact that the film is not about any kind of war, and that the trailer is misleading and a total lie. Yes, there is no war in the film, and especially no war between apes and humans - the only thing that resembled war had already happened in the Dawn. The film is a mixture of Schindler's List and Prison Break, while failing both. So, expect Scofield brothers with a Jar Jar Binks alike side-kick, trying to escape a Nazi death camp, and you'll get the picture. Pure luck is the main factor of literally everything significantly important happening. All characters, including Caesar, are reduced to total idiots surfing on the waves of ludicrous decisions followed by lucky circumstances.It's a shame to rate a film with such magnificent score, scenery, shots, and CGI with a 3/10, but it is just beyond my comprehension that they couldn't employ a decent writer. Those were the shallowest 2 hours I spent in the cinema lately, and I especially feel cheated on because, to me, they ruined something that could have been a great Sci-Fi trilogy of the 2010's.I will not go on about the nods to 1968 original, nor the forcibly put sub-plots to explain how some events in the original film were possible (a virus that causes loss of speech in one day, I mean, come on!) Or Koba's followers who are now willing to become humiliated human slaves and ape-killers, because oh they hate Caesar so much. Come on, the point of joining Koba in the first place was irrational and uncompromising hatred towards humans! I could go on, almost every single motive for doing anything in the film is ridiculous.Perhaps I am being biased, I admit I am watching in disbelief all these enthusiastic and positive reviews. But I cannot find a single positive thing about the film. To me, it defiled the trilogy and made me sorry for seeing Rise back in 2011 to begin with, and getting hooked up to the story.And perhaps it is not that awful in the end, but missing the opportunity to finish a great piece of work with a decent final touch is worse than making a poor one from the start.",War for the Planet of the Apes
477,tmaria1,Get us back to the original,9,3 December 2017,As much as I liked this trilogy and this movie I really wish they would lean more towards getting us closer in time to the original 1968 version. I understand these are prequels but if they are going to continue with these then I suggest fast forwarding a thousand years or more to just before when Heston arrives in the original 1968 classic. War was a good movie. I truly liked everything about it. I see the humans turning mute setting us up for the future. What I really want to see next is what caused the future nuclear holocaust? Show me what went on in the forbidden zone prior to Heston and crew arriving. Show us how the mutants from Beneath the Planet of the Apes came to be. If the ending of this movie was a foreshadowing of the lake that Heston crash lands in then we are going to have a problem. Remember he landed outside of New York City not over the mountains near California. Perhaps another trilogy can tie up these loose ends.,War for the Planet of the Apes

480,kathrynlet,Bad marketing tone but great film,9,31 August 2017,"I went and saw this on its last day in theaters. I was surprised at the tone shift. What I mean is that the trailers sell it as an action packed war movie with lots of ape on human fighting. That is not what you get in the theaters. So bad job on the marketing side.I happen to like what is in theaters better but I can see how it would be disappointing to some. Aside from the opening there isn't another big ape vs human fight for the rest of the film. If your hoping for a climactic battle between the Commander and Caesar don't. Instead you will get a far more riveting look at justice, values and ideals when you are hurting and have the power to hurt the person who caused all this. It can kinda feel like a letdown but it's nice to have a different approach.This is like its predecessors has a high level of introspection. It shows the complicated and conflicted choices for both groups, and that the right choice is a flexible thing. You root for Caesar but you also can feel for the solders and their ape slaves. In each movie it becomes clear that humans are losing ground and blame the apes for this. And in a way that is a justified reaction because the humans who created the virus are all dead so they blame the creation. That leads back to the complicate feelings and emotions of the participants.You can also began to see how the story ties into the 1968 Planet of the Apes movie. This movie shows the last gasps of the old order and the beginning of a new order. I don't know if that makes me sad or not. It more feels like a completion not joy. How the actors or rather species can change but the same problems and hopes are still there.The CGI is till fantastic and and the locations are wonderful. There are characters that feel under used or over used. Bad Ape is a bit over used and the comedic moments feel forced. He very clearly is suffering from PTSD and sever loneliness. The character is not bad just over used. Nova is the biggest question mark of the movie. She is the one that I feel worried for. At the end of the move I feel worried because while now she is safe what will happen now that Caesar is gone and when Maurice is gone. You worry that she will be the imprisoned and enslaved cause you fall in love with her.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I've seen the two other episodes. Well. The movie starts of with a war scene, where the humans attack the apes. Many apes die, as well as humans. The scene is like a reference to the Vietnam war, that the Americans are the ones that attack but just as the Viet Cong the apes got off the battle, but lost too many. If you have seen the other two episodes you will recognize the scenes, they are pretty much similar. Something happens. That changes Ceasar, the apes leader, he changes from merciful to be blinded by hate by forces of nature, but at the same time he still has some mercy left inside. The movie continues. Now we jump a bit into the movie, there I saw the references to Nazi-Germany and a charismatic leader, even the North Korean leader Kim came into my mind when the Colonel stood up there on the balcony. The flags hanging, just as Nazi Germany, but it was the American version. So they didn't say ""Heil"" but they could as likely have done that. Colonel was then portrayed as a ISIS-leader, but as a Nazi-leader, ruthless to his own kind for his purpose. Killing for what he believes a good cause. Then the apes. They are portrayed as the slaved black people, as well as the people in concentration camps during world war 2, but this time as smart as the Viet Cong, but no better than the slaves ISIS are keeping really. So with the feeling of the black people as apes, of course there must be a black Nelson Mandela reference in it all. A slogan in style with ""Apes together strong"", holding their fist's above their heads. They changed Nelson's famous portrait where he holds his fist above his head to two fists above their head. Since I don't wanna spoil the rest of the movie, I let it be here. This movie reminds me of Apartheid regime, of species wanting to look at the world with ""we and them"". So what was the point of this movie? That ISIS is not better than Nazis? Isn't it strange, felt like I already wrote that at one point about a Swedish television series once Well. Anyway, the movie gives a hint that perhaps we need to be more primitive in a way so we don't want war and have more heart and mercy for each other? Who knows? I have no idea. But the script seems to have looked at history and present time and made those stories to apes and humans of different kind. I give the movie a passing grade. It's not the best movie on this planet of humans, since the stranger sitting next to me kept on watching at his bright annoying watch a couple of timesevery now and then, until I suggested he shouldn't be so stressed. With that said, perhaps some think the movie is a bit slow and perhaps they could cut out some more to make it less ""slow"". But it is a entertaining movie for others, so see it if you must.

It started bad, had a bad plot, had no drama, no character development, had horrible attempts at tension, horrible solutions to problems, it all ends exactly as your 8 year old would have predicted, maybe the Producers preschooler wrote the plot. Yes it was that bad. Humans and apes? battle for the planet? I wish, except it wasn't, it was just pathetic.Oh and the worst part is the embarrassingly high reviews for this stinker. Too bad the Internet has become overrun with armies of paid shills, This movie, were it to be honestly rated by people that actually have seen it, would likely be less than 2 because I gave it a two out of pity.",War for the Planet of the Apes
489,kitellu,An Epic End to a Wonderful Trilogy,10,16 July 2017,"This is my first review here on IMDb :This weekend I saw the last chapter of the rebooted Planet of the Apes and wow I was so impressed that it exceeded my expectations. This movie is not really about war as the title may imply because it's much more than that. In this concluding chapter Caeasr along with the other apes are trying to escape the war with the humans as a result of the actions of Koba in the previous movie. An unfortunate event changes everything for Caesar who must decide on what course of action he needs to take for this event.Matt Reeves did an amazing job in pacing the movie due to its length but he handled it perfectly well; also including humorous moments even when the movie is in its most darkest moments. The score of Michael Giacchino is wonderful that adds to the suspense and tension of the movie. All the cast and crew of this movie (not only) are to applauded for their effort done. The CGI is so good that you don't really notice that the apes are computer generated or not because they seem so real. The cast are excellent in their roles, starting from the human side where Woody Harrelson and the young newcomer Amiah Miller are very convincing in their roles to the the apes where most the of actors portraying them showed genuine aspects of both the animal and human side of them.To continue from the above, last but not least, an honorable mention must be made to Andy Serkis who portrays the part of Caesar because most the the movie and the whole trilogy is about him and how he reacts to the events that unfold around him. His character is so emotional that the viewer will surely relate to him in one way or another. The expressions that Andy Serkis makes through the use of the character are exceptional and mesmerizing. At next year's Oscars, the academy must surely recognize this performance and reward Andy Serkis in some way or another because he truly deserves it.Concluding, the rebooted Planet of the Apes is a must see for all those movie lovers who love character driven movies filled with drama and suspense because these kind of movies don't get much better than this.",War for the Planet of the Apes
490,hidus,pretty horrible conclusion,1,15 August 2020,"I was really dissapointed and people who say it doesnt deserve low rating.. well its my opinion man. i loved 1st apes reboot.. once matt reves took on the project it went somewhere. dude cant do any original material and has his own thing goin which i cant relate to. this movie has SO many plot holes and anyone who can use little bit of brain will be rolling their eyes. yeah its fiction but still plot has to make sense.. the way they kill off certain apes felt funny instead of sad.this movie did not land for me and i think 1/10 star is justifiable considering i wanted to leave the theatre ASAP.
i guess u can say this movie is polarizing.. as i see lot of 1/10 or 10/10. if u want some mindless action movie.. mm i think go watch transformers.. this movie doesnt even give u good action. its so dark and grey and u can hardly tell whats going on in action scenes.i am really worried about his batman movie.only cool movie he made is cloverfield and thats because of a gimmick.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Loved the first two films but this final one of the trilogy is bad, really bad. I hadn't read any reviews in advance as I knew I wanted to see the film and thought the quality was guaranteed.First of all, there is no war. There are good scenes in the first 15 mins but that's your lot! As soon as they set off for Canaan, sorry a new home, this is where it should end. Everything after this point is ridiculous.À few points that grated on me: 1. A horse running easily with a massive gorilla on its back 2. Understanding sign language without looking at the signer 3. The pointless little girl 4. Having 1000+ soldiers but one person on guard at night 5. Capturing the leader of your enemy but keeping them alive with time and opportunity to plot against you 6. The Colonel is a clone of the Governor from The Walking Dead (with a contageous virus thrown in for good measure too!) 7.

Not too much war and action scenes, so this did not distract from having a good story.My only gripe would be that there was a bit too much comic relief in the sense of Bad Ape. One or two jokes one could understand, but they laid it on too thick and was borderline detracting from the serious story. Why do so many modern serious films and dramas have to have comic relief in it? The previous reboot Ape films did not have any of this obvious jokes in it and the story was wonderful. Bad Ape reminded me of the silly character Jaja Binx in Star Wars. Just too distracting and did not really add any thing to the story or film.There were plenty of lovely cinematography, especially the first beach scene with the horses. Many of the snowy scenes reminded me of The Revenant film as it had similar camera angles and scenery. Lovely.I would still watch this film again and can recommend it to others.",War for the Planet of the Apes
502,Jaymuller,What Would Caesar Do?,10,16 July 2017,"What does it mean to be human? This is a question I was compelled to consider while viewing War for the Planet of the Apes. The film's human protagonist, Colonel McCullough (powerfully portrayed by Woody Harrelson and reminiscent of Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now) champions the belief it is the capacity for speech and the ability to engage in calculated decision making, absent emotion, which places humans above Apes on the evolutionary ladder in the world depicted in the film. However, the film's non-human protagonist, Caesar (exceptionally done by Andy Serkis), demonstrates the inherent truth in the adage ""actions speak louder than words"", exhibiting both a selfless love for his own kind and the will to peacefully coexist with those who would call themselves enemy. This is a movie which delves into the very nature of conflict, illustrated by contrasting the familiar dichotomies of intellect vs emotion, good vs evil, love vs hate, and survival vs extinction. The motif that a culture driven by hatred born of ignorance and fear will yield to one driven by love born of understanding and acceptance is prevalent. In my mind, War for the Planet of the Apes provides the following conclusion: If the attributes truly defining what it means to be human are absent in the leader of a society, the society itself will be lost. I was not only entertained, I was enthralled.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Little girl show no mercy after father's dead but crying for a kong who gave her flower. And then slow pace every here and there. Half of the movie still showing ape in cage as slave.

The sad thing is they could have soared with the 3rd installment but instead made a $150 million dud. Soldiers with modern lethal weapons against apes with spears - just crazy. And the moral of the story, well there really wasn't one except all the human soldiers good and bad got killed while a remnant of apes survived along with a mysterious young girl who joined the apes. I think I would have preferred something where the conflict rises to a crescendo and then ends with a fragile peace with apes and humans learning to live together, not separate.

509,michaelmcdonald-20730,Exodus meets Schindler's List meets Planet of the Apes,7,13 July 2017,"A visually stunning film with great characters built on an unoriginal and somewhat boring story. Basically, exactly like its two predecessors. If you loved the last two, you'll love this one. Minor spoilers.Caesar leads his band of a hundred or so apes to a land where they can be free from oppression. Along the way, they are kidnapped by humans, put into cages and forced to perform grueling physical labor under constant threat of death by a man who vows to exterminate all apes from the world. Basically, its Exodus meets Schindler's List meets Planet of the Apes.. At one point, some apes are trying to escape and are gunned down by the humans on a snowy railroad track leading into the compound. If that does scream ""this is analogous to Auschwitz"" loud enough to the audience, I don't know what could. There are ton of other Biblical and Holocaust images in the film, but I won't spoil. Now there's nothing wrong with basing a film on those themes, it's just that this film is about talking apes who are replacing a dying humanity. I'm much more interested in seeing that film than focusing on this small tribe of apes seeking a better way of life. I suppose that's why I have never particularly loved this series. It feels so small, when it should be larger. The action scenes are loud and explosive, but the implications always seem remote and small. This film, like the last one, contains a small community of humans who armor themselves to the teeth, and practically all the action takes place in that location. Woody Harrelson is particularly good as the villain, offering a layer of depth lesser films would've ignored (you could argue he has more character development than Ralph Fiennes's Amon Goth, who is an obvious inspiration, particularly noticeable in a scene in which Harrelson appears on a balcony shirtless as the soldiers beat the apes). But questions always arise like: what's going on in the rest of the world? Is this all that's left of humanity? Are these the only apes? Is the Statute of Liberty that Charlton Heston sees years later standing right now? This film offers some small notion of an outside world, but again, it contains itself to an isolated location. This has its obvious benefit - it focuses our attention on the apes we love and care about, and this film continues to excel at it. But for a film with ""War"" in its title, I excepted a war. ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" might be a more accurate title. Film criticisms generally take one of two forms: you either criticize the film because of its flaws, or you criticize it because you wish it were made differently. My problems with War of the Planet of the Apes falls squarely into the latter criticism. Apart from wishing this film was different, I really can't complain. I just won't be interested in watching it again.",War for the Planet of the Apes
510,lucasnmnboyd,Let down,3,22 July 2017,"I was a huge fan of the first two re-boots. They had great character development, chemistry and personal conflicts that I could relate to, kinda, considering I'm a human. The second movie had perhaps the greatest movie moment ever; a crazed ape riding a horse, screaming and wielding two machine guns. But that movie made it work! I remember thinking to myself...THIS is why I love movies.I went into this one thinking it would follow suit and be even better than the last. Seriously disappointed. First, the good parts. Obviously, the CG is incredible. Ceaser is smarter and more badass than ever (at least in the beginning), and Andy Serkis proves that he's the master of this kind of work. Even his voice is impressive. The chemistry between he and his fellow apes is still pretty much there, he's still revered and respected, I guess. The visions of Koba were pretty cool. Aside from that...the bad parts.What I walked away thinking was that Ceaser didn't really do anything the entire movie besides deny help from his followers. He's supposed to be smarter than that. The fact that he was so determined to abandon all the apes he spent years building a relationship with just made me think less of him. That was not the Ceaser I fell in love with over the first two movies. Sure, I suppose he realized what's important by the end, but he wasn't the beast he was before. There was one good moment between he and the Colonel; after this tense scene I thought Woody Harrelson was actually going to be a good villain. After suffering through the ridiculous military decisions, cheap attempts at humor with the old ape, discount Abigail Breslin that really had no need to be there, I thought maybe we will get the kind of showdown these movies make great. What we got was this pretty well thought out sicko reduced to a bumbling mess because of a disease that was dormant in his body for fifteen years. Right then, it takes effect. What a cop out.I also thought the score was kind of weak. And I was honestly groaning at the 'single tear' cliché; there were far too many to be taken seriously. By the end, Ceaser gives up because they made it 'home'. Also seemed like a cop out. I know he isn't as young as he used to be but we have seen him take far worse punishments over these movies than an arrow. At this point I was hoping he'd see that window from his past as he died. The second one referenced the first one beautifully and I think this was their chance they didn't take.I suppose the point of the movie is to say that our conflicts are futile as nature will eventually win over everything. That's a thought provoking concept, and I appreciate the direction they were trying to take things. But think they should have kept things a bit lighter; the concentration camp feel just doesn't work with a PG-13 rating. They weren't able to take things as far as they needed to go and therefore felt kind of silly.I'm hoping they are done with these. There is nowhere to go now, and perhaps that was the point. Again, disappointment. Nowhere near the quality of the first two.",War for the Planet of the Apes
511,msbensley-44529,We Want War! or Humans are animals!,5,19 March 2020,"Other reviewers seem to fall into two categories.First are the haters, who feel cheated by the lack of war. It ain't war unless there's a LOT of bangs and booms and blood: ""I wanna see killing! Heaps of dead, burnt bodies! Kill! Kill! Kill!""
I can see how this would be disappointing.
Sometimes war only isn't about death. Try Caine Mutiny.Second are the lovers, who are fulfilled by the portrayal of apes as people and people as animals.
""Ape good, human bad,"" sums it up. I won't say the movie bends over backwards to be PC, but you might need a chiropractor after seeing it.Now, for the movie.
First, movies should entertain. This was OK, but it often panders with set pieces such as the little girl, the gorilla, and the flower.
4 stars.Second, the movie needs a plot. This movie seems to have been strung together with pieces of ""Josey Wales"" (revenge), ""Two Towers"" (quest in the dark land), ""Apocalypse Now"" (crazy loose-cannon commander), ""River Kwai"" (commandant vs. head prisoner; POW camp labor), and ""The Great Escape"". The biggest hole in the plot is where all the apes came from; there's not enough time for natural increase. Pacing is s-l-o-o-o-w.
5 stars, at least they picked good parts to emulate.Third, a movie needs good acting. Woody Harrelson is not at his best, but certainly not at his worst. Andy Serkis was at about his average, but, for an actor who never shows his face and acts solely through voice and posture, is in the top 10% of acting.
7 stars.As far as the Boulle book and the Heston movies...We live in an age where we look for the ""why"" and the ""how"" as well as the ""what"".This trilogy functions as a reasonable explanation of how the world of the book and the Heston movies came about. This movie is the weakest of this trilogy.As the weakest, it's still far superior, in all aspects, to the Heston movies: acting, special effects, script. The ONLY thing superior about the Heston POTA is the Statue of Liberty scene, but they ruined that with his raving.The book is the best, but it's far too late to say read the book first.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I've only seen the Tim Burton version once and felt it to be very mediocre. After seeing it... my god, I loved it! I can't really explain why, but I just loved it. Rise of the planet of the apes: I was very hyped for this sequel, when I noticed the release-date... Oh... I had already watched the sequel. To this day I still get the order mixed up because of their similar names. Dawn should be first, in my opinion, since dawn is, by definition, a beginning (e.g.: the beginning of a new day). I watched this as a prequel, and boy was it good. I had already gotten to know Caesar in ""DOTPOTA"" so it was very pleasant to see his backstory. I encourage you to watch the series in this order. James Franco's character was a mystery to me until I watched this movie.War for the planet of the apes: Since I fell deeply in love with the series during the other two movies my hopes and hype were high for this 3rd installment. Right of the bat though, the title is wrong. It's ""ROTPOTA"" and ""DOTPOTA"", but now ""WFTPOTA"". When I started watching the movie I found myself asking, where is the war? A thing happens and our main characters set off on a journey that's very slow and pointless. There are some character development that I liked but it's not interesting enough to valid the slow pace. When we finally get to the end it's very anti-climactic, especially in regards to the main villain and his... arc.

516,kamykaza,War for the Planet of the Apes 2017 - disappointment of the year,4,20 July 2017,"The best thing you can do about War for the Planet of the Apes is, not watch it. If you love or like the first two parts, don't watch it, if this is your first glance to the trilogy, don't watch it. If you are 5 years old and you like apes, enjoy. Where to start? The first half our of the movie can stand alongside the other two entries. It's directing, acting, effects and musical score once again remind us that a good mature sf-drama is not only fiction. But, to my big disappointment after that the movie goes only downhill. As the first movie was one of the most pleasant surprises (where I expected superficial mindless action) this movie is one of the biggest disappointment. There are so many flaws to the story, so many moments that make no sense at all, that the viewers literally cannot feel for the characters. The movie is full of this melodramatic close up, very slow scene that should give meaning to the moment, but they don't because the movie doesn't give us a reason to care for the characters, or for that matter, the world. The main idea behind the movie, that the good guys (apes) have mercy and bad guys (people) don't is also very washed up, seen 100 times and not well done. Acting is for the biggest part CGI, done very well. Woody, doesn't shine, but his character has no time to develop, so he has to do the cliché scene: ""This is why I am evil and this is my evil plan, now I will not kill you but close you in a prison, even though I am ruthless and merciless"" Makes this movie a James Bond movie from the 70s, and not a closure to a great trilogy about one of the most interesting sc-fi stories.

Snowy, gritty mouth feel. Pairs well with epic Westerns and Kurosawa -- although any epic Western pairs well with Kurosawa. ... Actually, there is such a strong unity message here, and so many powerful performances from the motion capture actors, flawless special effects, gorgeous photograpy and epic scope ... it's so beautiful.

Something that humanity hadn't yet lost, but which the apes hadn't necessarily learned yet. All the apes gathered around find so much suprising meaning in the gesture, as it sinks in, and we realize what an amazing gift given to a friend at such a time. And it all happens in just a few seconds. Beautiful. The whole film is like that. Slow-going, not something you would want to see outside comfortable circumstances, but well worth the time and concentration. Does not shirk from either realism or thoughtfulness.",War for the Planet of the Apes
519,mastersparky,Caesar the moment!,9,17 July 2017,"From Caesars humble beginnings, to the spread of the human virus, to the best film of the 3, WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES has to be one of the greatest trilogies ever created! With special effects and motion capture so stunning that you forget you're watching CGI apes for the majority of its run time, WAR is a flagship movie for how far we have come in SFX world.We follow Caesar from the very beginning, an Ape that we've seen go from innocent child to cruelly–treated animal to fair and peaceful leader. He wanted nothing more than protection for his family and his tribe. The genius twist in this series of films is that we humans are the bad guys. We find ourselves rooting for the Apes and in some deep and intelligent way it becomes more than just a film but an eye opening realization of how dangerous and cruel humans can be.Andy Serkis plays Caesar and does one of the finest jobs I've ever seen in portraying an emotionally damaged and morally confused CGI character. It is so beautifully captured you can actually see the pain in his eyes, the heartbreak of losing love ones and the anger growing inside him.Other characters who fight alongside Caesar do equally amazing performances and Steve Hahn who we're introduced to in this brings along a healthy dose of comic relief, perfectly balanced to avoid WAR becoming just a tad too depressing and grim.Woody Harrelson is this films main villain and provides a stellar performance with one particular scene so intense I'd challenge anyone to not be pulled into that room with them! It's an incredibly powerful script with a very somber tone but is never depressing. There's a great theme here linking consciousness and the darker parts of human nature, and the film runs the gamut of being heartbreaking, suspenseful, moving, and even inspiring.The film is bookended with battles and the opening shots are stunning, drifting above the battle scene as the war rages on below. Its beautiful and terrifying at the same time. The director Matt Reeves doesn't revel in the violence in any way and it is sparingly dashed throughout the film. A small part of me wanted more WAR come the end of it but upon looking back I realise that it would have been unnecessary. Not so much a War of the explosive kind but more of a emotional inner conflict within Caesar himself.The pacing for the most part is perfect however the beginning of the final act does seem a little rushed and a few questionable events happen all too quickly. It's not enough to spoil the film in any considerable way and it soon leads into a very satisfying climax.WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES is an epic action film, with a strong emotional core to the story that genuinely moved me. A lot of love has gone into this entire trilogy and Matt Reeves has created something truly special here.For more reviews be sure to check out www.popcornography.co.uk",War for the Planet of the Apes
520,aiwana,ridicules,3,19 October 2017,"this series of ape movie go's too much far, they should stop after part No. 1, it is unacceptable, ridicules, doesn't have any message.I am still wondering why the apes has to ride horses while they supposed to be so fast and easier to move better than a horses, and how could a horse hold a giant gorilla and run normally, and very fast!! reminds me with tom and Jerry fantasy. plus apes always had an uncovered butts, how could the director missed an easy custom like that.The feeling, attitudes, reactions of the apes becomes more humanity more than the main idea, apes should become more smart (which i the basic idea), it seems the writer / director missed this point. they could easily made a movie of people fights each others, which would become more acceptable than this failure.this is not a thriller, action movie, it was so predictable, and the ending was very week.",War for the Planet of the Apes

523,viitkarjoosep,Fell asleep,5,25 May 2018,"Well, let's start with the fact that I fell asleep somewhere in the third act I think, which usually means that its boring or I'm watching it too late at night. In this case, I think the biggest problem was absent of the human characters. Yes, there was bad military and a little girl who didn't speak but as a human being no matter how good apes are it was hard to relate anything in this movie. In previous two movies, there were always good humans who were trying to help apes, in this one there were none. All human characters were really blank and not interesting at all. Yes I like Woody Harrelson as an actor and all the movies I have seen him in but as a villain, i couldn't take him really seriously, probably because he usually plays another type more fun characters and whey they handled him, in the end, was really weird and I just didn't like him really in this movie. And he is the only human character who has some depth other than just being military. That I think is a reason why I welt movie was boring and I well asleep. Another thing that I just couldn't understand, maybe I'm too stupid but why does Caesar speak English with other apes all the time, I don't remember maybe he didn't learn the ape language in the first movie because he was raised by a human but he definitely should by now have learned that from other apes that he's living with. I will say the apes have never looked more realistic than this in those movies and the whole movie looks really clean and it is nice to look at. But yeah it was definitely let down and weakest one so I'm glad i didn't have time to go watch in the cinema.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Here the bad guys are the American army, this is made apparent in a scene where all the poor lovable apes are jailed and starved in a large area with an American flag is on display, and just to get the point across the Star Spangled Banner is played. The chief badest of the bad guys is The Colonel, and just to put the liberal icing on the hate cake they show a Christian cross in his quarters. We certainly don't want to show the bad guys as those who slam passenger jets into buildings, or who behead anyone who doesn't adhere to their brand of religion, or stone women to death who commit adultery, or drive trucks into innocent pedestrians in Europe.

531,mhochwald,"Great movie about Evolution, Teamwork, Compassion for all creatures, Important Lessons",10,19 July 2017,"This is my first review of a movie in many many years....I read that many reviewers took issue with this movie for many reasons. Having no plot, being boring, Anti-American, etc.I guess those people do not see the true plot and amazing story line in this movie.The pinnacle of two colliding forces (Humans infected by a virus causing them to lose their voice or devolving and the Great Apes becoming more intelligent and exuding more evolved human-like traits). Man are threatened by the three species of Great Apes who show they can communicate better, work in harmony ""Apes together strong!"". No irony lost on me on this incredible narrative in this movie.Caesar is magnetic in his character. An inspiration for all. Shows compassion for his people, mercy for his enemies and yet still has his flaws with his desire for revenge on humans for his personal deeply hurting strife.His story arc is as powerful and wonderful and could not have been better written. We should all strive to be as strong has him. As compassionate as him.People need to see this movie and understand that this movie is very deep in its narrative and how it highlights our best characteristics as human beings; compassion, love for our fellow man no matter what race they are, ability to communicate verbally and non-verbally with those that are not equally capable to work together for a greater cause. No Great Ape (or human infected by the virus) is left behind or considered lesser. These apes in this movie are what we humans should aspire to be like.I loved this movie and will be thinking on its great vision for a long time to come. I can't wait until my kids are old enough to watch it. I hope they can see this movie for what it really is - A great story about working together with all people to seek peace and happiness. To always show compassion to all creatures, love and defend our brothers and sisters but show mercy to those who call us enemies because they fear us for being better than they are.If you are American, please don't let your patriotism for your country blind you from seeing the lessons in this movie. Someday I hope patriotism for country is replaced by patriotism for our planet and all creatures that live on it. Our arrogance and ignorance removed. Caesar is an amazing leader. I admire his incredible character. So many lessons to be had to make all of us better humans.I find I love many movies that are misunderstood. They are made by very intelligent people and those who are flawed or lack ability to see the science of the movie don't appreciate them and miss out on something that is important on a greater than a movie scale.I hope this review gets read by someone that then watches or re- watches with more scientific 3D glasses.Please enjoy this great movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes
532,Siggi963,Brainless,1,3 April 2019,"For a start, I generally like science fiction movies, if the sci-fi world is reasonably well conceived, I like to accept the realities of this world and accept those realities.
But this movie is set in a world close to ours. Even if a big chunk of humanity has been killed by a virus, it is absolutely idiotic for the still millions of human survivors not to prevail easily in a war against a few thousand apes, one of which is quite intelligent, a few of which have the intelligence of 12 year old humans and the rest has the intelligence of human toddlers. The apes have sticks and stones as well as a few human weapons while humans have access to millions of machine guns, tanks, war planes, bombs, grenades and whatever evil stuff the human mind has conceived over thousands of years to kill each other.Yet, the movie humans find no better solution than to attack hundreds of apes with 10 to 20 guys with machine guns an knives????In reality, men would send 5 B52s with 100 Kg bombs over the forrest with the apes followed by 5 B52s with napalm an then the forrest would be encircled by 5000 soldiers with machine guns and grenades that would kill everything left moving while moving in. Problem solved in less than a day.Sorry, but this movie is so far from anything realistic that even with the best intention and most open mind for the fiction I had to to turn it of after 30 minutes because it was rhe most stupid storyline I have seen in years ... and I watch many movies.By the way, the CGI is top notch quality ... Money does not make a good movie at all times",War for the Planet of the Apes
533,hawaiianshirt79,Serkis Monkeys,9,16 July 2017,"There's always a danger with threequels. Even when the first two films in a franchise work (Alien, The Godfather) many attempted trilogies fail to stick the landing (previous citations, plus Raimi's Spider- Man, arguably The Dark Knight Rises.)With this trepidation acknowledged, it's both a relief to see War For The Planet Of The Apes succeed, and a genuine pleasure to see such a good movie of any stripe. With the nascent ape civilisation on its back foot (paw?) after the events of the previous film, Caesar (an uncanny Andy Serkis) is pushed over the edge by the scrappy - but still dangerously gung-ho - human military, led by Woody Harrelson. To say that the effects are impressive is almost a given. For the first time in the franchise, I genuinely didn't notice a single moment where the various apes looked like CGI. Added to this technical mastery is a fantastic direction, from shots of horseback apes riding along a beach that recall important moments of certain other films, to multiple moments that recall silent film in their reliance on the beauty of an image to convey sentiment without dialogue.Unlike Gary Oldman in the previous film, who was wasted as the most generic ""human"" character this side of Troy McClure, Woody Harrelson is given room to shine, especially in the pivotal scene where he reveals that he is the most terrifying kind of antagonist: a true believer. He is filmed from angles that evoke Brando in Apocalypse Now, but where Brando was rambling and lost, Harrelson brings a frightening, laser focus to his character. The overarching success of the film lies in its world-building. We see two societies, human and ape, that are behaving in absolutely believable ways given their relative positions, but at ground level this is an intensely personal story. We've followed Caesar, the chimpanzee with a genetically altered brain, for two films so far, but here he is no longer the first movie's conflicted experiment, or even the second film's reluctant leader. Caesar is an established primate king, with all of the attendant burdens. As always, Andy Serkis is superb, bringing both humanity to Caesar's troglodyte body and underlaying an animal physicality to his human frailty. Special mention, also, should go to franchise newcomer Steve Zahn, although to discuss his role would be to ruin a surprise.Overall, this was a superb ending to a trilogy that was always better than its source material would have you believe.",War for the Planet of the Apes
534,Jayowend,Apes together... strong... this... movie.... not so... strong...,2,9 December 2017,"Alright the movie production, sfx, choreo weren't bad but a number of things in combination eventually just ticks you off. The weakest part was by far the script. Slow, bland, and uninspiring. What parts of the film featuring human dialogue felt insulting to watch, like they tried to push the concept of 'primitive' way too far. In an alternate universe this movie could have been a 10/10. Here's all the reasons why it's not by the end of the film. Let's go in order.-1 for misleading trailer. They crammed every second of action footage into the trailer, but in the actual film it was nowhere close to what people expected coming from the rest of the trilogy.-1 convenient plot device #1 - donkey from the opening forest raid escapes by simply assuring Winter he'll be spared by the colonel. by the way, what ever happened to that escaped donkey?-1 soundtrack - for the love of BANANAS how many times are you going to inundate us with that same melodramatic piano tune?!-1 coca-cola truck ad breaking immersion-1 artificial character development - Nova (the girl) doesn't bat an eye for her dead father/caretaker but one flower later she's crying for the ape. Didn't you meet him only 20 minutes ago?-1 sign language logic - apes communicate through sign language and grunts. OK. But Caesar looking through binoculars and somehow understanding the chimp next to him is just silly. Also.. how does the girl manage to learn the language of the apes in a single day?! (maybe it's the mutated virus) -1 convenient plot device #2 - single guard that holds the master key gets baited into opening the cage. I'll admit I chuckled at the poop flinging.. but THE LOGIC. COME. ON. You had ONE JOB.-1 every scene feels like it's being played in slow motion, like they were purposely trying to match the apes' style of speaking or something. Speed it up by 1.25x, trust me. You'll thank me later for saving you half an hour of your life.-1 convenient plot device #3 - victorious soldiers rush into a demolished base for no good reason.

The only thing good about it is that now I know not to trust Rotten Tomatoes which gave it an aggregate of 93% which is dumbfounding. There is no way to begin to count the ways that this movie sucked. Too long, stupid stupid impossible situations with no attempt at explaining how these preposterous events could actually happen. And on top of that dripping with syrupy sentimentality (Apes with sweet, no sad, but caring tears in their eyes)... And on top of all that the effects were not as good as the first movie which I was astounded by. The movement was just off (watch the rock hefting scenes more carefully; the rocks clearly weighed about 2 ounces each).Sure, I already suspended my disbelief that we got talking apes taking over the planet, and yes I loved ALL of the original 5 movies for their camp and charm.

541,SHBCinema,A good end to the critics,6,17 June 2018,"Before starting the movie, I did not think at all about having a movie with a movie that is far from the previous episodes, especially the first part. The story space is completely different from the previous sections, as if you were watching another movie. Perhaps this end could have been better. All the glances at the end of the film are the fate of monkeys and humans, especially Caesar. The film could have been more magnificent. For critics, which was enough, but people expect another, I think the film alone is a good film, but it is not a good sequel to the previous films of this series because the viewer sees it with another mentality. There were two previous episodes, even in my opinion the authors of the previous sections, such as Rick Jaffa, were better able to write the script. The film's music is not suitable for action scenes, and most of all it takes classic movies and needs a more epic rhythm. Characterization for Caesar was very appealing in the Rise of the Planet of the Apes, but fell out of the second part of this characterization, but it was better in the third part, but it was no longer as brilliant as the first one. The film has too much dramatic scenes that are not in these films and should focus more on the action scenes of the film than the scenes of Caesar's pain. The movie War for the Planet of the Apes does not just have weaknesses and has many strengths, including good director of action, exciting compilation and ... each of which is important.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I see what they were going for, but it wasn't really anything original and felt kinda bland. On the other hand, Maurice was an absolute brilliant character and fantastic addition to the modern series. And the CGI. I've never been a fan of CGI, but when it's done so well like this, immersive, detailed, I'm just in heaven. The facial expressions were so fantastic. Maurice looked so much better than the rest though. Not that anything else was bad, Maurice just felt so real and... good! I also thought that the biblical allegories were really solid and intricate, with the film referencing Moses, Jesus and even Abraham and Isaac. If there is a negative, it's that the human tactics are rather stupid. For example, humans trying to shoot the apes while they are being attacked by missiles. Or the fact that they've discovered an enemy base, but don't scout the base at all and begin to attack from a lower position. Oh well. Woody Harrelson was a great villain. It's hard to make people not like Woody Harrelson, but this movie does it. And I love what they did with his character at the end.

545,joeldowler,One of the best movies I've watched this year!,8,24 July 2017,"I knew as soon as the 20th Century Fox intro came on with jungle drums along with the signature trumpets, that I was in for a treat. Firstly the CGI in the movie is nothing short of immaculate and the entire movie was visually stunning along with Woody Harrelson (or as I know him as Haymitch from The Hunger Games) playing one of the best villain (?) I've ever seen as sometimes he's your typical villain and at other times you somewhat understand his mind-set or even feel sorry for him and indeed the humans. Throughout the movie I was contradicting myself as I was wondering whether or not the humans were actually the enemy. As you discover that a disease (presumably caused by the Apes) is infecting humans and affecting their ability to speak, you begin to wonder if the humans are just trying to protect and save mankind (lets be honest, what would you do?) The turning point for me was when Colonel was standing on his balcony shaving while watching the apes being forced to labor in his camp and this immediately cast my mind back to a movie called Schindler's List where Amon Göth stands on a balcony overlooking a concentration camp and kills two people with a sniper. This immediately made me realize that the humans were the enemy, after all they created the apes in the first place. But even still I do feel sorry for Colonel in a way as he killed his own son because he caught the disease, I think he got driven mad by grief. At times the movie did drag especially when the apes were held captive in the camp but didn't harm the movie overall. At the end of the movie when the avalanche takes out both of the human armies after a massive battle I began to realize the way nature is punishing the humans throughout the movie for creating the apes in the first place (i.e. the disease and the avalanche). I believe that this was the movie's way of saying that nature will always win. Finally Caesar's death scene really captivated me as it wasn't your typical death scene where everyone gathers round weeping and so forth. It was kind of beautiful in a way that Caesar knew he was going to die but was happy as the apes had found a safe new home and when he died not many of the apes had realized yet and all this one in the midst of a sunset. So it wasn't by any means a happy death, but unique compared to most death scenes in movies. Overall rating 8.5 out of 10",War for the Planet of the Apes
546,guslatho,Sleeper movie,9,16 August 2017,"Going into this movie, my expectations were not the highest. Movie 1 was good, the 2nd was good too but not exactly memorable. However, War for the Planet of the Apes completely blew me away.From beginning to end the movie was near perfect. There are little elaborate war scenes in the movie, most of it is just following the apes perspective on the war between apes and men. However there is so much to draw you in. There are loads of great little moments in the movie that invoke a lot of emotion. Even though you're just looking at ape they sometimes come across as even more human than humans themselves (especially in this movie). Also, there's some good amount of humor that also works in the movie's favor.For me, this was the sleeper hit of the year. Easily the best of the trilogy. 9/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
547,JGar40,It's a wonderful movie. A sci-fi epic,10,21 July 2017,"In truthfulness, I was going to give it a 9 but after seeing so many repulsive reviews I'm giving it a 10. The cinematography and the CGI is the best in the film industry and it's just unbelievable. This is not a war film contrary to the title which is part of why people are leaving bad reviews. This is a sci-fi film that also explores what people are willing to do to survive and it explores the dark side of human nature. I feel a lot of people came in expecting some epic CGI futuristic ape v human because they never watched the first 2 films. Caesar played by Andy Serkis has his strongest performance yet and ends this trilogy very well. New character Bad Ape is not necessary but provides a little comic relief in an otherwise dark film. In a throwback to the source material and older films we have Nova, a little girl who is important to the plot. Overall this a great film and a good end to this ape trilogy and I do hope we have more Planet of the Apes films like this in the future. I think most of the people who are reviewing really don't understand cinema and are partially hating it because it's not a War film. If you haven't seen the first two films and will be bored because it's not the way it's advertised don't watch. But I recommend this as it is a masterpiece.

That is a testament to the actors and the filmmakers. This is wholeheartedly a war movie, and a good one at that. The motivations of Caesar and the Colonel are fleshed out and understood. The sides of each coin are complex and given screen time, not just displayed as black and white. The movie focuses on Caesar and his family and how they feel. Caesar reeling from the death of his wife and son is consumed with vengeance. Even drawing parallels to Koba from the previous movie.

After any given movie is finished, and my companion and I walk out of the theater, we're usually discussing the movie (good or bad). This one we didn't. And honestly, by the time we drove home, it didn't matter and I didn't care. The movie was, overall, that forgettable.From a cinematography, CGI, and FX standpoint, War is fine. Maybe even excellent. But then, it's 2017. I expect that in sci-fi or fantasy movies. There are no ground breaking visuals in the movie. The main characters are fleshed out fairly well, although the script (and director) fall into a completely unnecessary Jar-Jar Binks comedic character trap with one of the leads. The pacing of the film is slow. I don't mind a long picture if the content and pacing justify the length - which doesn't happen in War. And I shouldn't come out of a monkey movie that on one level is so very depressing I wanted to slit my wrists. There were plot holes galore, only about 20 minutes of real action, and like I said earlier, it was instantly forgettable.

Great acting, CGI, story and importantly - Giacchino & Reeves took a different approach to this score & got it right (it's really cool). Pages of 1 star & 2 star reviews? ""I walked out after ** minutes""?? It's like people are being physically(!) slapped in the face instead of watching a cool/fun movie saga about intelligent talking Apes.

The story-telling was okay, but in contrast to the first two movies, very little happens in this one. There are constant hints towards a war (trailers, title, stills on the internet, etc.) but the only war-like scene is the opening scene: the apes get ambushed by men and then briefly fight back with arrows. Whatever war there is between the apes and humans, happened between ""Dawn"" and ""War"". Instead, it was more of a classic revenge story about a character, Caesar, that ultimately doesn't want revenge. Woody Harrelson's character was non-convincing and some of his scenes literally got me nodding in my seat. The finale was an anticlimactic fight between to human armies, with the apes actually fleeing the battlefield. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, not at all: this was by far the best film I have seen this year. But it was so disappointing in comparison with the two prequels. If you're expecting something like part III from Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit, you'll be disappointed. Whatever war the title suggests, is more of a Cold War.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I am a huge fan of the franchise, including the first two installments of the reboot. This film was incredibly disappointing. The plot was almost non-existent, the pacing was all over the place, the tone kept juggling and the development was forced. It felt like they had no clue how to end the trilogy, so they threw together a ton of walking inserts, and landscape shots with sprinkles of action sequences sparingly used throughout. Slow movies do not bother me but pretentious garbage like this film is entirely not watchable. The solid cinematography and good use of CGI to not make up for the nonsensical plot.

This is because Rotten Tomatoes hyped the living daylights out of this film, anything being compared to ""Lord of the rings return of the king"" better blow me out of the damn cinema. Alas the film did not.To be fair there are many good things about the film. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and the music score really add to the emotional journey of Caesar. Andy Serkis nails the performance and you do get attached to the legend of the great leader. For me Maurice's(Orangutan) character was the most lovable of all.

That is probably caused by the director liking the new technology that enables making animations show emotion in their face a little too much. Besides that there are also too many side plots that slow down resolution of the main plot too much. Especially the ape slave labor situation to build a wall takes way to long and just makes you feel like the director wanted to make two separate movies.,War for the Planet of the Apes
569,owenchou,Great setup but bad execution,7,25 October 2017,"First off, this movie was disappointing. Not because it was a bad film, but because it didn't live up to its predecessors' many ways. The cinematography is on point as well as the visual effects. The apes look more realistic than any other planet apes film. The film also had a great lead - Ceaser. Andy Serkis once again pulls off an amazing performance, maybe one that could define his career. However, despite its overall achievement, the film was very disappointing in many ways. The movie title clearly says war for the planet of the apes. But what we got instead was a holocaust camp full of apes and one ape trying to rescue them. Meanwhile, the humans themselves have their own war. This choice was very bad to me because I wanted to see a ""War for the planet of the apes"" Going into this film, I wanted an epic battle between the humans and the apes. But what we got instead was a battle between humans and apes trying to rescue them out of the cages. Some people thought this might have been a right choice, but to me personally, I thought it didn't live up to my expectations. The first two films focused on the apes and the human's relationship. This film almost completely ignores that except for the torture camp that the humans hosted.But aside from the negatives, I did find Caeser's arc to be satisfying. He went from a child raised by a human to a hardcore and bad-ass leader of the apes. His death, however, did not leave any emotional impact. Personally, I feel like it's because the villain was set up so well and his motivations. I would've preferred woody Harrelson's character to kill him instead of a random soldier. With great conflict, the emotional impact could've been stronger. But Andy Serkis's performance was very dark and emotional and he is probably one of my most favorite movie protagonist in movies.Overall, I did enjoy this film. It was disappointing but it doesn't mean that it's a bad film. At this point in time, I still think dawn is the best movie and War goes behind Rise.",War for the Planet of the Apes

War for the Planet of the Apes seemed to me as simply a showcase for the digital ape effects.It's full of closeups of different digital ape faces against a blurry background. Af if it's 1957 and we should be marveling at new Disneyland animatronic characters. It's full of distant shots of digital chimps scurrying around. That's most of the movie.What people are saying is thought provoking, is a simple illustration of two groups in conflict. Draw comparisons to Nazis and Jews, black and white, Shia and Shi'ite, slave and slave owner. The same ""thought provoking"" questions arise.The only difference here is that it's put into a science fiction context - what if apes were as smart as humans? Well, what if cats were? Or squirrels? Had this been an action film, I'd say OK, it's an action movie and it's fine. But it isn't. It has some action, but is not an action film. It's mostly a very slow moving, dull, inarticulate drama.Inarticulate in two ways. A lot of the apes use sign language instead of speech, and the script is not clever or intellectual. A few flashes of well written dialog come up during an exchange between the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) and Caesar (digital ape) and that's all there is. Less than five minutes. The rest of the dialog is mainly focused on vengeance and war or merciful understanding. There's no complexity or intellectual stimulation here.I'm shocked that nearly all professional film critics give this movie a high rating and praise.

This movie is impressive in thy it is mostly driven by ape characters, it feels like other revenge movies I've seen, except...with apes. You care about them. But it lacks closure. The ending is contrived, though I am sure we are supposed to find it ironic. The apes survive ultimately thanks to their ingenuity and luck and staying out of trouble, more or less. There are some nice touches, such as the twist that befalls the Colonel. But the humans in this are mostly mindless, the apes for the most part aren't a lot better. It's an anti war movie, it's an anti hate movie. And it has a silly comedic character that feels very out of place. If you are British or Irish of a certain generation, you'll think PG Tips. I would have liked some kind of resolution that showed progession for one or both sides, that they rose to a challenge and triumphed. Whereas this all ends a bit flat.

574,hello-41679,"Good CGI, Generic Characters",2,8 October 2017,"It took me awhile to warm up to the characters. Sure the CGI is fantastic, but the apes themselves look like the ones you might see at the zoo. I guess I was expecting them to wear clothes and have really cool armor and weapons. Nope. Most of them look identical. The plot is a series of one tragic event after the other, from the apes being imprisoned, then beaten, then tortured, then killed ... very few fun scenes which makes the movie depressing to watch overall. Lots of plot holes. For example, the military based supposedly is located on the border of California, yet it's constantly snowing ... a lot! (yet ironically a desert is supposedly located nearby) There just happens to be a large oil tanker with ""highly flammable"" in gigantic letters smack in the middle of the base ... really? Also, there just happens to be an underground tunnel system directly below the base the apes use to escape, yet no one else knows about this. Then when the apes do finally escape, instead of running away from the base, they run around it, passing every guard tower possible. Lastly an avalanche happens to wipe out all the humans.

True it does kind of spoil the surprise ending of the original film where Charlton Heston finds out he is back on Earth. But then that could only really work the once. This take on the PotA has shown some well thought out scripting and demonstrates that you don't have to sacrifice good writing for good CGI. Andy Serkis demonstrates great range of emotion through his CGI ""mask"" building on Gollem from LotR with a greater subtly. For me though the best performance goes to Woody Harrlson who imbues his character with a greater degree of sympathy than your usual villain. And that really is the point of the film. That things are not always black and white. If I have any quibbles it is that Caesar is a bit too vengeance driven in parts and I am not sure about the comedy character.

All the leads put in sound performances and the script managed to develop the character, albeit some of them in a rather linear fashion, for example Harrison role as a ""mad"" renegade army leader was a little predictable but remained enjoyable non the less, he plays this type of ""off the wall"" role very well.Some of the plot lines will annoy military purists with battles scenes more akin to Lord of the Rings with modern weapons, but this rather misses the point it suited the plot line and gave the background for the endgame.

577,poisonivy-25023,10 Pro & Cons for seeing & not worth seeing 'War for the Planet of the Apes',10,21 July 2017,"Pros: 1. Andy Serkis delivers yet, another great amazing motion-capture performance. All of the emotional and expressions, are his. Not only that, but he was a great voice acting.2. The CGI is breath taking. Everything in this life, looks real and lifelike. The apes really look like, they were there.3. Movie focus on the ape characters more, than the human characters. Thus, giving us, a more of an understanding, on who they are. The last two previous movies had, way too much human characters, that the apes seem secondary.4. Woody Harrelson gives a well-delivered, haunting, and reasonable performance as the Colonel. He probably the most memorable human character, ever in the reboot series.5. Lots of meaningful symbolism and metaphors like the harsh allegory of race relations and class warfare. Also Authoritarian Vs Working Rights is also brought up. Also, natural selection, holocaust, and genocide.6. The music by composer Michael Giacchino is beautiful to listen to. Nova's theme song is by far, the best.7. Lots of clever references to the previous films, using names, locations, and story elements, such as 'Nova', 'the grand desert' & others.8. Great use of locations. The beaches of California to the Serra Mountains are breath-taking.9. Great morality tale. The conflict of seeking mindless revenge versus great power comes with great responsibility was worth seeing.10. Perfect Closure to the reboot series with Caesar's arch as leader. Rise & fall. It really shows, why Caesar is so beloved, by his people.Cons: 1. Misleading marketing- There is barely any battles between the human and apes in War for the Planet of the Apes. Most of the film, takes place in a prison settling. Movie should be called 'Great Ape-escape' 2. Movie isn't worth seeing in 3D, as the film has little action for the most part. It's mostly, a clever game of leadership, as each party, tries to outdo, the other, without too much violence.3. Movie is super dark, gritty & somewhat depressing. Not suitable for everybody. The visuals looks kinda gloomy. Very humorless.4. Confusing plot holes, involving the Colonel decision to keep the apes, alive for so long, even if it's against the character's basic instincts.5. Woody Harrelson is a bit over-the top evil. The movie doesn't do, a good job, exploring, why he is so brutal to his own people, because they can't speak.6. Some people might find it, offensive. Lots of paralleling to American Slavery & Concentration Camps of Nazi Germany.7. Bad Ape is borderline, Jar Jar Binks level of annoyance, due to his cowardly nature. Also, his humor doesn't match, well with the serious tone of the film.8. Confusing plot holes, involving Koba's followers. Why would they follow man, if it's everything that Koba was against, of!? It makes no sense for any of them to join, with the Colonel's Army.9. Another nitpick, how in the hell, was Nova able to get into the prison without being notice. Isn't the guards supposed to keep watch, since any day now, the large Army will be attacking them!? Shouldn't they be, in a high alert or something!? 10. The film has a lot of clichés, that were used before, in other action driven movies, such as, seeking revenge will not filled your heart with peace & the hero giving the ultimate sacrifice for his people, during wartime; often leaving others, the task of rebuilding. The film is somewhat generic & recycled if you think, deep about it.",War for the Planet of the Apes

580,purveshgholap,Emotionally Resonating yet Satisfying,9,11 September 2019,"War for the planet of the apes is the third installment to the trilogy, the previous two films have been amazing. Rise of the planet of the apes was pretty underrated for what it delivered, didn't got the enough recognition it deserved nonetheless it was a great watch. Dawn of the planet of the apes was a fantastic sequel it was pretty dark in its tone, however the story telling was on point and the characters were memorable. The first ape film which is rise was about ceaser character about his origin or where he belonged, the second ape film which was dawn is about ceaser leading the pack of apes, where humanity has gotten extinct due to their own hunger of power of science and technology, and third film focuses on ceaser's journey where he is dealing with the toughest time of his life, which will lead him either to his death or salvation.
War for the planet of the apes is an excellent third installment to what has become one of the greatest trilogy of all time, this movie is emotionally powerful. In this movie ceaser is the most broken, the most vulnerable and is also filled with lot of hatred, the guilt of losing the people he couldn't protect, his journey has been explored so perfectly where you see a great character development in him. Matt reeves has returned to direct the third installment, he did a great job with Dawn and has done a fabulous job with war.
This is one of the best visual story telling movie I've seen, the CGI of the apes has just gotten better over the years, in war the level of details in these characters is just fantastic, they look very photo realistic, the CGI has been done by some very talented people who deserves a pat on their shoulders, the cinematography is also brilliant as some of those shots look very beautiful.
Andy serkis has definitely given an Oscar worthy performance here, in previous two movies he was amazing, but Andy serkis has never been this good in any movie that he has ever worked in, his character is just so broken so deep, his performance really makes you feel sad about him and even the supporting cast gave very satisfying performance. In this movie we get introduced to two new characters that is mute girl child (her name is not mentioned because that's a spoiler) and bad ape. The little girl in this movie who was mute for the entire film had to relied on her expressions to give a good performance, and she was great in this movie some of her moments with ceaser and Maurice were adorable, in this very dark story telling movie some of these sweet moments were a great addition, and the character of bad ape could have been a problem as his character is comedic, but he was handled very well, and some of his funny scenes were a nice touch of humour and really added something to the movie.
However, this movie did a false marketing, making people believe that the movie will be action packed buff, with its title war for the planet of the apes, many people that it would be action packed extravaganza, but it wasn't. This movie does have some of the actions scenes, but most of them were just in the beginning of the film, after that the film a deal dramatic story visaul story telling movie, it didn't hinder my experience as the story building and the character development of this movie was so great that at some levels this movie even exceeded my expectations, but that's isn't the case with everyone, as some people I know were disappointed due to lack of war type action scenes.

So many thing are very dumb, unnesseserly elongated scenes that were not even needed in the first place.. and it just keeps piling up for 140 minutes..The scale of the dive in quality of writting is like they made 3rd movie of LotR with just bilbo and gandalf sitting at the campfire talking nonsence for 2 hours .. jeez even that would be more fun..
Only thing that is still there to let you know you are watching new planet of the apes movies are the animations. Such a pity..This movie even has nothing to do with its title..

585,dinandwoesthof,Epic ending of an epic trilogy,10,22 July 2017,"I'm a HUGE fan of the previous Rise and Dawn (Rise even more) movies so I really looked forward to the last movie of the trilogy, War for the Planet of the Apes and it did not let me down at all. Actually it was everything I could hope for and more. I won't give away any spoilers but this movie has it all. The special effects, the music, the story, the action and the acting are truly amazing. Any how can anyone not love Bad Ape. He was so funny and such a cool ape. I loved him a lot. Without a doubt my favorite movie of 2017!Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar for this movie in my opinion. He gave Caesar a special place in my heart forever and I want to thank him for that. I kneel down, kneel down and wonder!",War for the Planet of the Apes
586,soorya13,An excellent ape movie. Not much love for humans,9,16 July 2017,"This is a movie by and of Ceasar. The king Ape is already tired from the events of the Dawn. All he wants now is ensure that his tribe and their civilization have a safe home. He personally has no ill will towards humans and only wants to be left alone. Enter the colonel, who sees this as a zero sum game, either the apes like or do we. He has no reasons to believe that the two species can ever coexist. The resulting conflict results in deep personal loss for Ceaser. This is a story, of how Ceaser deals with grief, guilt, fear and weakness. Some how he has to overcome this for the sake of his species. Full credits to Matt Reeves who has not only brought the best out of Andy Serkis' Ceaser , but also from the other Apes cast. You can easily feel the fear of the entire tribe as they go through the events. Woody Harrelson's colonel is also great, though his presence is lower than I thought. Human's only have a supporting part in the movie. But this is to be expected if you had followed Reeves' comments.",War for the Planet of the Apes

588,b359,Sucker punched by good reviews of a truly horrible film,1,1 January 2020,"A movie so bad that the even the CGI couldn't save it. The script is exceedingly awful.

589,RomeoQuint,"It's great, but would maybe benefit from being a TV series?",7,1 November 2017,"This installment in the series felt like a mixture of Schindlers List, Star Wars, The Great Escape and the previous Planet Of The Apes installments. It was about leadership, ensuring the future generations well-being, family, revenge, cowards, traitors, friendship, espionage, escape, slavery and so on. The list of the themes that are present in this movie is pretty impressive for such a ""short"" film.Also the execution is beautiful. The visuals are, as expected, astonishing! The sets, the cinematography, the motion-capture & acting, the CGI and even the editing (letting the characters breathe and think)...all of it is brilliant. I was in awe how real the apes actually looked. In some cases I was even sure that they used practical apes and masks. The CGI was THAT good. (I wonder how long it will take to actually see believable CGI-humans though)My only issue with this movie is the fact that IT IS a movie. Every situation and every consequence feels (to me) just a little too impact-less. It does not hit my feels the way it should. The main reason for that is, in my opinion, the limited time we spend with all the characters. I think it is a rare case where the movie would have benefited by being an eight episodes long TV show. The additional running time could be used to further explore the characters, thus making everything that happens to them more impactful.But that is just personal complaining on a high-level. The movie is great and I definitely recommend seeing it. It is for sure a well spent short time.",War for the Planet of the Apes
590,hoopaholic,"Great movie, much better than expected",10,16 October 2017,"First of all, the trailer for this (the 2m30s one with Really Slow Motion's music) is amazing and got me hooked, so I had marked this movie as a must-see. But I kept reading and hearing negative stuff about it, so I delayed watching it.Now that I've seen it I honestly can't understand what people are complaining about...it's got everything - action, suspense, great acting, perfect music, jokes and most of all it has a feeling to it similar to Avatar - sometimes we go against things we don't need to.It sucks that most people have been brainwashed and turned into zombies who can't see anything beyond Transformers and Spiderman. I'm not saying this movie is some kind of a genius masterpiece, but it definitely gives food for thought and it's not paced as a mainstream type, easy-to-watch 1h 20m trash movie and maybe this is what bothers general audiences. What worries me that War for the planet of the apes is not even as deep as many other movies and is being hated on, so what happens with movies that really want to have different atmosphere or message than just pure action? Will there be more of them coming in the future or will most movie makers adjust and not risk doing something different.Overall I loved the movie, I wasn't bored for a second of it and would love if they find some way to prolong the story.",War for the Planet of the Apes
591,ijazahmadaqsa,"Lazy Writing, Slow Paced, Could've Been Better",4,16 July 2017,"If you know the Biblical story about Moses, then that's this movie.Essentially, Caeser the ape is like the leader of an oppressed people (the Israelites). They are taken as slaves by the humans, to build a wall (Egyptians forcing Israelites to build cities). They are whipped and tortured by the humans, until a plague (surprise surprise) kills their leader (the human army Colonel).An army of humans come to the place where the apes are and are killed by an avalanche that destroys the human army (much like the Red Sea drowning the Egyptians). Then Caeser the ape leads the freed ape slaves (Israelites) across the desert...to the promised (a new) land. Before joining them, Caeser dies, as Moses died before setting foot in the promised land.All in all, it's the story of Moses, the Israelites and the Egyptians, but with apes replacing the Israelites.Lazy writing!",War for the Planet of the Apes
592,hrerty,Plain nonsense,5,17 March 2021,"I liked the other two but this one was a huge disappointment. The story was totally stupid, irrational and unbelievable. IRL Ceasar would have been just shot and it would have been end of the story. Atmos was nice though.",War for the Planet of the Apes
593,Argagax,So disappointing,3,16 November 2017,"I was really looking forward to this one. I loved Rise, and Dawn was perfectly okay, so I expected something else that was pretty great. Oh was I wrong.Asides from the things many others have commented on (but unlike 90% of IMDb users, I can give a film something other than 1 or 10 stars) like poor pacing, poor plot, the lack of an actual ""war"" and so on, I have several things that were bugging me so bad.1) Bad Ape. I get it, an attempt at comic relief. Well, it was indeed BAD. Painful, painful character, stupid attempt at humor that definitely wasn't missing in the two previous films, and I was immediately wondering why his voice was so different from the other apes. They speak slowly, as if they have to force the words out. He had poor grammar, but spoke with a very human voice with no effort. The character served no purpose other than to get laughs out of seven-year olds, who of course aren't supposed to watch a film like this anyway.2) The girl. Like 100 other commenters before me, WHY didn't she react to her father being killed? Since we have no information to the contrary, we can only assume he was her father and that he didn't treat her badly, yet she didn't shed one tear. But a gorilla gives her a flower and dies an hour later - BRING ON THE TEARS. Her only purpose, as stupid as that of Bad Ape, was to be cute and innocent.3) Killing off Caesar's family - WHY?! I know why, cheapest plot device in the book. ""Man, two films, we're all out of ideas."" ""I know! Let's kill his family and send him on a revenge quest! That always brings in cash!"" It has been done. To. Death. And I was really disgusted Caesar's son, who was a real character, was killed off so swiftly, with no scene or time spent on it. Just BAM - there's his body, leading Caesar into a very cheap and clichéd vengeance-rampage in where the hero battles his former foe on the inside (Koba).4) Speaking of time, CHARACTER. Lake was given about five seconds to show she was in a relationship-kind-of-ish with Blue Eyes, and her only purpose was to be the only remaining adult sort of-family member of Caesar, after his son and wife were killed. No relationship build-up, as poorly written as the girl crying over the dead gorilla. ""Quick! We have to get through all this fast so we can have long, endless scenes of nonsense later in the film!""5) Caesar dying. I'm not entirely sure this is bad. I am half sad about this as the character deserved a much better end than this horrible excuse of a film, but at the same time, I hope this means they will make no more movies, if this is the path it's headed down. (And you're telling me THEY WALKED THROUGH A DESERT - and no one noticed he was injured? And he just ""goes to sleep"" the moment they get there?)6) Easter eggs or homages to the old films. I like this when it's done just enough. Like the swift mention of ""Cornelia"" in Rise, the name of Caesar, and that Caesar's mother's name was Bright Eyes. But now... it went overboard. Caesar's second son is named Cornelius? Come on, you already did that with Cornelia. The girl is named Nova? And that's the FIRST time in three movies that the orangutan Maurice speaks? Ughh...7) White man bad. Remember this, kids! White Christian men are evil! (I am neither a man nor Christian BTW.) White man destroy stuff! White man kill ""the other"" for no reason at all! White man stupid! White man destroyed, we happy! - The moral message of the film, which we have already seen done to death for the past 50 years.8) CG. This was fantastic. Like many others said, almost the only redeeming feature of the film. And those who loved the film, seems to mostly praise this. But CG alone does not make a film great. My question is, if they can spend so many millions on photo-realistic CG, can they not spend 0.0001% of that on finding GOOD writers? PLEASE. Hollywood has really gone downhill in recent years, and this is further proof of that.I had to check if the writers and directors were the same throughout the three films, and of course, they were not. They took in new writers in Dawn, and moved out the original writers in War. I could tell straight through, since it was unintelligent, propaganda dribble, with the worst pacing and writing I have ever seen.
I have changed this from 5 to 3 stars because there are very few redeeming factors of this film.",War for the Planet of the Apes

The story line is pretty sharp and no plot holes noted by me. I didn't understand the hate on this movie first but then I realized all hate is coming from people who have extremist racial and religious opinions. We need to be honest on some points when we review a movie regardless of the message it gives. Because the message may offend us, but a movie is not only about the personal opinion of ours. It is a creation. In terms of creativity and cinematography, we need to review it. Most people have reviewed the movie badly just because they have offended by the movie. and I saw so many 1 star ratings.The movie is a masterpiece. In terms of creativity and cinematography, this movie is up to the level of all other top rated movies. I have been bored when I watch the Avengers 2.

595,mishra-rishab23,A good movie with obvious plot armour.,7,23 November 2017,"CGI is very good in the movie. Andy Serkis did a good job playing Ceaser. The story was great and the conflict between apes and humans can be felt throughout the movie. There is very little action in the movie and mostly its apes talking. Many people would not like this. But this movie keeps us hooked till the end. It shows emotional side of ongoing war between the two sides rather then long action sequences. The movie is however heavily biased towards the apes. I didn't like how in the end Ceaser throws a grenade on a flammable truck waiting for getting blown up and every human just dies. That's just bad. And that little girl, Ceaser kills her father, but she doesn't show any emotions. Maybe she was very shocked. But then another ape dies and she starts crying who she met a week ago. The whole Prison Break thing done poorly. There was only one guard on patrol, like seriously, one. There was no backup.

Only two human characters receive any character development, Woody and Nova. Nova realizes humans are garbage and tries to become an ape. A nice reference to the original, amazing Planet of the Apes with Nova's name. The naming should have been more creative than having an ape name her from the discarded vehicle badge from a Chevy. I left once the avalanche destroyed the human Army. Like Woody, I kept hoping humanity would survive the war of the apes.

It is truly a powerful movie full of emotion and suspense. It gives us a glimpse into the past of human actions and as well as a glimpse to what our future could become.The story telling is as captivating as the revolutionary visual effects.

Every move is boringly predictable. What is this, ""even animals are better than us, humans"" hate hymn?They say there is a lot to emotionally relate to, people are crying during the movie. Ok, I am a bit deprived emotionally, but not that much, I have cried during movies. Here, nothing, not even the tiniest spark of emotion.Where are the actors? I barely noticed anyone's work, except maybe for Caesar, Colonel, Bad Ape.I'm quite patient guy, I extremely rarely turn off a movie in the middle. Maybe 10 I have. This was close. To be honest, I did not mainly because I was very tired and could not think of anything else.I have watched few hundred movies in my life and this is #7 where I gave 2* Just a statistic to show I'm not generally negative.Graphics are really good, this is the reason it did not make 1* for me.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Why i say its a bit off on the war side is because its never really an all out war as you would expect of a movie today or the very least its title.Its more of a on and off battle that goes this way and the other way but never really a final battle that settles everyone's differences etc. But even if i feel like there should have more to the movie i still loved it, i don't really get all the hate it gets just because there isn't the war they expected.",War for the Planet of the Apes

He looked fantastic and acted very well as well.But I see some negative reviews here from people as well. My only request to anyone who is reading this is at least watch it once and then decide your verdict because this movie deserves to be seen, a true MASTERPIECE.A special mention to the unbelievably brilliant, beautiful and thrilling action set-piece in the end.

Dear God, this CGI is real, there is not a single trace of non-realistic look. Bad Ape. This guy is the comedy relief, but he has a dark backstory, but that is incorporated into his comedic actions, I really think he was a good addition to the movie. Emotional impact. This movie was very dark and that was good, you really felt hate, sadness, sympathy, and fear in this movie along with the main characters. Performances. Andy Serkis once again kills it as Caesar and everyone else perfectly portrays their respective roles.Bad: Misleading marketing. The trailers have all the guns firing in one clip so it feels like it will be a war movie. There is also a poster of an army of apes with guns against the human army, that never happens. This story is humans v humans with Apes trying to stay away as much as possible, which is not what I expected or wanted from this movie.Storyline. The story is very interesting and thought-provoking, but it moves very, very slow. If it moved faster I would've thought this was a much more engrossing and edge-of-my-seat film. Ending. I said this film had no apes versus humans, the film felt like a buildup to a moment like that, but it never happened. I found the ending to be quite anti-climatic for Caesar and the series as a whole.Final thought: This film had flaws, and wasn't what I thought or hoped it would be like. Nevertheless, this movie was entertaining and a good ride, it definitely had very interesting ideas, but I just wanted something different. Don't go into this movie expecting a war movie, expect a revenge story. It would have made more sense if this film was called ""Survival of the Planet of the Apes.""",War for the Planet of the Apes

I enjoyed the various throwbacks to the originals and it managed to tie everything together perfectly. The story may not have the action that the title would seem to promise, but the depth of emotion within the characters and the intriguing plot makes up for the lack of fighting. Caesar fights with his own inner war, giving him more depth and development than before and the blurred line between right and wrong makes you question your own morals. There were a couple plot holes and the movie was very serious and dark with few moments of levity, but overall the movie brought the trilogy to a close perfectly.

The second half was kind of a let down...,7,1 August 2017,"The movie was not as awful as I'd thought it would be, though it was definitely the worst of the trilogy. CG looked decent, except for the one white gorilla who looked really fake. The action was nice. Woody Harrelson as the Colonel was amazing, he was clearly having fun in this movie. I also thought it was a good idea to focus entirely on the apes again. I really couldn't care less about the humans in Dawn, I wanted to see Caesar damn it! Luckily this movie had me covered. The first half is really good, shows a proper conflict between the last humans and the apes, the losses that come with war and Caesar still having to cope with Koba. The second half however turns into a prison escape movie. The apes who were supposed to be so powerful are now all just put in cages where they are completely powerless. And the ending was barbaric. They had to keep it a trilogy, so let's have Caesar get hit with an arrow, flee, survive an avalanche, travel through mountains AND a dessert for days, maybe even weeks and only THEN let him die from his injuries... disappointing. Overall, this is certainly not a bad movie and I'd maybe watch it again. But it really isn't a masterpiece of cinema.",War for the Planet of the Apes

This is my 2nd review ever and I don't review things unless they particularly rub me the wrong way.I'll be spelling certain words wrong to get around word gagging orders on IMDb.War of the Planet of the Apes literally beats you over the head with this defecation of the human spirit, I'm in awe of how blatantly forward it is and I love good sci-fi commentary. (Battlestar Galactica and The Wire are some of my favorite pieces of fiction)Here in this script we have no sympathy for Harrelson's and humanity's understandable dilemma as to how to beat a virus that is causing humans to lose their speech and higher faculties. They don't even have the balls to have the apes wipe out what's left of the human army as that would make the apes even more obviously terrible than they already are; so they have a natural disaster do the job. The blond girl/child that they carry with them goes to live with the apes, dumb(from the virus) but happy.......and humanity's downfall is complete. Even though exalt the child's beauty early in the film! But what is beauty without brains ultimately?What great moral lesson was I supposed to glean? That humans are so terrible that we should walk quietly into the night? Oh look the apes are thick.....but some of them are funny Totally worth it!Conversations and plot points are so monosyllabic that it was almost orgasmic when Woody Harrelson turned up to speak more than than the few grunts that we hear up to this point and FINALLY gives us a reason to care.Bonus points for cultural maxisms (spelled wrong to get around censorship) is when the blond child cries over the ape who is killed that she has known for all of two scenes but doesn't even flinch when her father is killed by said group of apes.Go out to the beach with your kids, hell even go the beach or lake by yourself, hell go further, go out when its raining and make some memories.Also I'm not the slightest bit Christian and I can see this picture is blatantly not only anti-Christian but to the non religious out there as well its this......anti human, anti intelligence",War for the Planet of the Apes

Through emotions and decisions the real battles worth watching are.

Additionally, I've collected comics books related to the story, a small library of paperback novels, British annuals and other assorted literature. To say I was delighted when I heard of the reboot is an understatement (ignoring the Tim Burton travesty). Thus far, I've thoroughly warmed to the latest trilogy, and watched War last night.Serkis performance is spectacular, convincing and profound. Harrelson definitely deserves a nod too. The storyline is far from action- packed, and indulges in too much exposition, becoming bogged down in the middle of the picture. The inclusion of a cartoon-like chimp character is grating, and incongruous. The continued reliance on sign language by many apes, requires subtitles, which become tedious if you didn't expect a foreign-language film - hopefully subsequent scripts will have all the apes capable of speech. When we look back on this period of PoA films, this one will likely be viewed as one of the lesser works (much as Beneath the Planet of The Apes is in the original collected works).

Feels like half was about people being offended by humans being the ""bad guys"" and the other half was disappointed by the lack of war. I mean how offended can you get. Yes it is anti-war and humans are the bad guys and that is freaking awesome!I think this was a really good movie. I liked the lack of war and the more meaningful and interesting parts that was there instead. I also liked that humans was the bad ones for we definitely have the capacity for filling that role over and over again. I also liked that the focus was on the apes and the bad humans were just bad. The effects are stunning, the story is good, the ape characters are developed really good and Andy Serkis does a marvellous job as Caesar! I was satisfied with the third installment in this franchise. And I really liked the end, I will say no more... If you want a mindless action-guns-blazing-explosion-pro-army film this is not for you.

612,jacobfeltner,A Fantastic Finish,10,3 April 2018,"First off, I'd like to say, I think the only reason this movie is getting so much hate in the user reviews is because of the expectations this movie creates for itself with a title such as ""War"". This movie ends up being more of a thoughtful, character driven drama centered around Caesar, rather than all out war full of explosions and effects. If you're wanting to see this movie to see all out war, then don't.  I was a fan of the first two movies, and personally hold Caesar as a really beloved character in the film world. The character arc of Caesar that we see take place over these three movies is quite extraordinary, and this film does a great job of wrapping things up and concluding his legacy.  Andy Serkis is, yet again, fantastic in the role of Caesar, and the supporting cast of both apes and humans is very good as well. Steve Zahn in particular does a great job with his role, and is a standout in the film for sure. The special effects are as good as always with these movies as well. However, this film isn't just a bunch of nice looking special effects with a lacking story. This film is well thought out and has a real story behind it, that is heartbreaking at times and yet satisfying at others.  All in all, this is a masterfully crafted film that focuses on Caesar and how his character deals wth certain situations, and how he deals with the turmoil within himself.

Great action and drama.,10,12 August 2017,"Rise was an awesome movie and Dawn was even better but I must say that War for the Planet of the Apes is the best movie in the trilogy. The story is about the conflicts that humans still have with the apes. They want to kill them all before they take over the world and before the human race faces extinction.It's hard to talk about the greatest things in this movie without getting into spoilers but don't worry, I won't spoil anything. The movie looks amazing; the CGI is outstanding in this film. There isn't a single CGI element that looks fake. The facial expressions of the apes are amazing and the performances by everyone are great.I think that the suspense that keeps building up during the film is great. And that's because of the good use of the music. There are moments that something important is about to happen and the music keeps building up and then there's complete silence. I think that helped a lot to keep the tension in every scene it was used.The action in the film was great. It doesn't have that much action until the third act but once it starts, it doesn't stop for a while and I found that pretty great because it is very entertaining. And that's another thing I wanted to mention; the movie didn't have a single moment that bored, despite the fact that is a two and a half hours movie. It doesn't waste a single minute.Something I loved about this movie is the villain, played by Woody Harrelson. At first, I hated him, not because he was a bad character but because of the fact that he was a character that just wanted to hurt and kill the apes, but then you understand what is his motivation and why he's doing what he's doing. For me, he was a well-written character and his rivalry with Caesar was one the most interesting aspects of the movie.But the most important character, obviously, is Caesar. He doesn't want to start a war, but he will fight for his family and the apes if he must. He goes through a lot during this movie and that's what gives him the motivation to fight. We really see the change if we compare him to the way he was in the other movies, and we see that he's grown as a leader and as a character whom we can empathize with.Then there's the little girl that ""joins"" Caesar and his group. She adds so much to the character development of our main characters because she gives them a sense of humanity that makes us like them more.Without getting into spoiler territory, I wouldn't say this is a ""war"" movie. Sure, there is a conflict between the apes and the humans but it isn't in such a big proportion to be called a war.I would say this movie is a perfect ending to the trilogy. They couldn't have done it better than they did. And I would place this as one of my favorite trilogies of all time.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Film: War for the Planet of the Apes
Score: 8.5/10
Review: War for the Planet of the Apes is the third instalment of the Planet of the Apes franchise. It's a continuation the previous two films Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn. We continue with the story of Caesar the main protagonist who is also the leader Ape, played by Andy Serkis.
In this movie Caesar's wife and elder son are killed by a rogue army colonel, and we follow him on a revenge path to find this colonel and kill him. Caesar encounters a small mute girl along this journey and she joins along with Caesar on his mission.
This is movie is straight up amazing and incredible. There are stunning shots all throughout the film, apes on horsebacks, snowy mountain tops, incredible landscapes and much more. The action in this film is very brutal too, even with a PG rating there are some gut-wrenching scenes, and seriously watching Apes on horsebacks is truly sensational. The visual effects and the motion capture are truly in a league of their own, we get super close close-ups on the faces of these apes and they actually feel very real, the fine textures of the skin, minute pores and small facial features, really brings out the character.
Our antagonist played by Woody Harrelson who is a rogue army colonel with a battalion of soldiers, they want to take down the apes and kill 'em for good. Woody Harrelson depicts himself as a savior who can restore the planet back again. He kills Caesar's wife and child; he captures all of the apes when Caesar was on a search for Him. The film shows that the colonel has kept the apes in a sort of concentration camp and makes them work without providing food or water, when Caesar gets caught, he is tortured by getting whipped, kept in the cold for hours, no food or water. We definitely develop a hate for the colonel and we learn what type of mindset he has to develop due to his actions done in the past.
This film gives an amazing and a very deserving end to this already epic franchise, from the very heartfelt and emotional story to the magnificent visuals and epic storytelling, we spend a lot of time and develop care and emotion for these characters, we get where they are coming from and we sympathize with them. No moment is ever very dull and has a purpose to serve to the overall narrative of the story. Very few franchises manage to give a proper trilogy and this is franchise knows exactly what it is and delivers extremely well on it.

620,dmcwild-90854,Apes Bad! Humans Bad! Movie Badder!!!!!!,1,3 July 2019,It started out with some solid action and then became a long slow boring movie. The ending is so ridiculous with the remainder of the American Army fighting each other only to have the winning side whipped out by an avalanche.,War for the Planet of the Apes
621,jakedn-38604,Intriguing,9,13 July 2018,"The characters are what really stand out in this movie. Any Serkis' portrayal of Caesar is amazing on so many levels, especially when you look at how he's more human than most of the human characters, and the Colonel is equally amazing for the opposite reason: his lack of humanity.
 Although this is an action movie, the action is but the smallest tier in a multilayered plot, which was clearly the main focus of the movie. A plot with complexity that can (almost) rival the Lord of the Rings.
 And don't even get me started on the family and leadership style drama in this movie. It could make a grown man cry. Not me though.
 As you can probably tell, I love this movie. The quality is something that can not be described, but only witnessed, and I suggest you go witness this.Also don't show this to your kids unless they have a relatively high tolerance for things in movies.
 Like when they say, ""thematic elements,"" they mean it. There are also some relatively bloody wounds and disturbing phycological elements.

The hell is up with the 1 star ratings!Let me first talk about the problem of what people think is the meaning of: war. I believe some of these primitive IMDB reviewers where expecting a Return of the King type of battle. But if you look up the word war... don't worry, I will safe you the trouble, than what we saw in the movie is exactly that. A war is a state of armed conflict between different countries or different groups within a country.That is it, no more no less! People arguing that this was not a war are simply wrong.Put that to the side and what you have left is some amazing cinema in my opinion! For ape sake, I forgot at some points that I was watching apes talk! All CGI but with the help of the amazing Serkis it just became real. Cesar was more real than any other CGI character I have seen... ever.

Excessively long and slow, filled with monologues by characters explaining what they're doing WHILE they're doing it, and too many war film cliches to count, this movie was a slog to get through. Lazy writing and exposition, and obvious plot twists pervade the work; while Woody Harrelson's ""Colonel"" loses all credibility as he describes, in detail to his sworn enemy, the best way he can be defeated.

The Harry Potter books and films depicted this theme as so did a lot of other good and entertaining films. This movie is not exempted. I liked the Planet of the Apes themes and have watched the TV series when I was young. However, I noticed that Hollywood likes to vilify Christians and nationalistic fervor. The villain had the Christian and nationalistic vibe as seen in the use of the cross motif as his decoration and the use of the US national anthem to start the day in camp. I will not be like the progressive/regressive left who will just mark down anything against their beliefs. I liked this film just like the other Planet of the Apes reboot. If only Hollywood will stop their political indoctrination in their films and stop bashing Christians and nationalistic people. They should not also glorify their causes and make the right the villains and the left as the heroes. I hope that instead of portraying the LGTBQ community as always good, how about portraying them as serial killers. Heterosexuals and some so-called religious groups are portrayed as such. Are all gay people good? I am waiting for a Hollywood film that won't be afraid to portray something different for a change.

Being as it was on tv tonight though, I thought I would give it a try.I have to say, having pushed through the first few minutes, and when I forgot my reaction to the cgi, I was hooked. The film encompasses an array of traditions, borrowing a lot from westerns such as ""Last Train from Gun Hill"", with the hero going after the murderer of his wife, even though it cost him a lot to do it. The addition of the little girl and ""bad ape"" adds a fascinating component to the group who join Caesar on his revenge quest. Again, from descriptions and pictures of ""bad ape"", I really did not think I would like him, but he was actually one of my favourite characters. The writing in this film is superb. With bad ape, they apply just the right amount of pathos, and also humour, without pushing it too far, making him a very likeable character.I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't seen it, but it is very gripping and fulfills again, a lot of the goals of a typical western saga.

The reason why I do this now is the reason that I see so many stupid people who's telling that this movie is bad. Especially who is giving ones and twos for rating. Just unbelievable, how you can give for this movie just one star. It just shows your stupidity not to see many aspects about this movie. Just only for CGI effects should be 4 or 5 stars minimum even if you didn't like the story :) These people probably have never seen bad movie or this is just first movie in their entire life. Second reason is that I really liked this movie. The reasons are many - very good CGI, very well presented emotions by apes, good story line with enough action and some very funny moments. Its not meant that its full of war and gore, its meant to be war more likely psychologically than physically. But still there is enough suspense and action, enough for that movie, but mostly I liked how relationships between monkeys and humans were presented, all the pain and misunderstandings. I liked that instead of mindless action there was more other things. There was plenty to think about if it would happen in reality. Its movie for thoughtful people, people who have sympathy and emotions, people who can think more widely. Anyways, I enjoyed the ride and cant wait next adventure with apes :)",War for the Planet of the Apes
632,tonyrr1,"Good Visuals, Poor Story & Plot Elements",6,18 April 2018,"I'm disappointed in this film in spite of thoroughly enjoying Dawn and Rise. Good points... 1. The visuals are largely very good, and the CGI is well-employed and well-rendered... 2. Top-billed cast turns in very good performances, particularly Serkis in the lead role... 3. The first set piece of the film, a military confrontation between an ape outpost and a human assault force, provides a great opening. The action is both realistic and compelling, and I still marvel at how well the ape characters are so believable... 4. The passing of Caesar with Maurice comforting him was very emotional. It's a testament to the two actors' skills that they can bring so much feeling to their performances even in motion-capture. Unfortunately, these good points are overshadowed by some glaring weaknesses that pulled me completely out of the suspension of disbelief... 1. The human child Nova seems to serve no purpose other than as a point of interest to the apes. In fact, the apes viciously gun down her male human guardian (father perhaps, but we aren't told), but Nova has no reaction to seeing his bullet-riddled body... 2. No one in the human weapons dump / fortress notices when a) all the apes in the exterior cages are gone even though said cages are in full view from anywhere in the complex, or b) in very un-military fashion, there must be no sentries on duty in the complex or along the wall as the apes are able to escape across it, again, in full view of anyone who would open their eyes. 3. The final battle feels very contrived and improbable given what happens, in diametric opposition to the well-executed battle at the start of the film. The action is poorly-paced, and the CGI for the helicopters and rocket fire takes a noticeable dip in quality. It's very appropriate however that both fighting forces and the armed camp are buried in an avalanche at the conclusion. After such a noisy mess, that really was the best thing to do.Was the film worth watching as a bookend to the recent Planet of the Apes trilogy? I'd say yes, but I also think this might be a Redbox or on-demand viewing and not one to add to the blu-ray collection. One time sitting through it was enough. If in fact they do produce another in the series (the ending clearly sets up that possibility), I hope the folks take a hard look at this latest installment and do better with the screenplay than was done in this film.",War for the Planet of the Apes
633,D-Defoe,Apes are the better humans now?,1,13 July 2017,"What I do not like about this movie is the basic message: Humans in comparison to animals cannot be trusted, they show no mercy, the animals reach the higher ethical ground and should survive and reign the world.How is the goal of this message achieved? First, the whole movie plot is filmed from the perspective of the ape- society, their families, their friends, their love and their sorrows. Unlike the perfectly arranged classical Charleton Heston movies in the 60s which bore a shock element in a dark post-nuclear, post-apocalyptic world, where mankind destroyed itself, this movie aims at showing the worthlessness of human beings. The little blonde girl whose father got shot dead by Cesar, didn't loose a single teardrop for her father, but after a short while befriends herself with the apes, starts crying for a dead gorilla, who gave her a flower, gives water and food to the imprisoned killer of her father, Cesar, and feels herself quite comfortable now growing up as a monkey daughter in the sense of a Tarzan, yet in a considerable lower social position. Second, other humans, except maybe for Woody Harrelson as a pittiful leader of a small company, do not have character depth in this movie, and are basically the enemies, and except for the little blonde girl, they all die, either killed by monkeys, by themselves, or by a snow avalanche.What a stupid movie! What a stupid message! Worthliness of human beings is being shown here. Of course the human is bad from nature (described as sinner), as the Bible tells us, but he is not worthless, and as Gods creation is above the animals. Here you see the perversion of this idea to the extent.Now to the ambiance: Cold, snowy, Alaska-like landscape, no cities, no larger Human or animal dwelling places. Most of the time 5 apes and the little blonde girl take the central part in the non-inhabited boreal wilderness on seek of revenge.The fights: starting with a tactical nonsense Human uphill assault with well equipped tactical weapons against spears and still being lost. Only 3 humans and a silver-backed Gorilla get captivated, and after a short interrogation get released by Cesar, but later become his fiercest enemies again. Major explosions quite in the end of this almost two hours movie. I spare to pinpoint the many flaws of the fights there, just dumb.Better title in this case would be: ""War for the little ape reserve in the Northern Alaska (or whatever landscape it represented)""Cesar's portrayal - in the beginning: the good leader - in the middle: the bad revenge seeker - at last: and the ugly Spartacus in the workingcamp Conclusion of the movie: all humans dead (except girlie who feels herself as a monkey) and the long exodus to sunny monkey land next to a big evening-sun-bathed lake, where they all lived happily there after,...oh no, not all, Cesar finally died from his arrow wound, which he survived for the 1000 km trek through the deserts of death Valley (or whatever location it represented), with a last glimpse of his little monkey-boy playing with the little blonde human girl, he died right in the arms of his Orang-Utan friend Murksy, Mopsy...forgot the name.

I gave it 6 stars because (A) the cast was brilliant in executing a miserable story, and (B) my 24 year old son who I saw this with absolutely loved it, so I respect his demographic viewpoint.The film starts with the necessary scenes required for background, character introduction, and future motivation. From that point, the script can be described as a stripped down version of ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Ten Commandments"", bonded with a poorly glued finger joint. And this is clearly acknowledged in the film itself. For instance: if one is too dense to see the similarity between Woody Harrelson character (The Colonel) and the Marlon Brando character in Apocalypse now (Maj. Kurtz), in one scene we are shown the graffiti ""Ape - ocalypse Now"". I won't divulge the similar obvious displayed parallel(s) to ""The Ten Commandments"" so as to avoid real plot spoilers.The one thing I am truly grateful for is that they did not follow all the details of the plots of these two earlier films.

It absolutely can be and I was floored with this film.The performances, the visual effects (which will win the Oscar in early 2018), the story and the cinematography were all so incredible. This film feels and looks real, despite the fact that it's about a group of CGI apes just trying to survive. Each scene was riveting to watch and each one perfectly led into the next one. While many have complained that the title is misleading, it's actually not. There is a war going on between humans and apes and there is a inner war going on in Caesar's mind.

The story is just badly written and often times makes absolutely no sense. Only reason for giving it 2 stars (instead of 1) is because it was nicely filmed.It seems the writers for Hollywood movies are becoming dumber and dumber. Like the bomber scene in the last Jedi movie (bombers in space dropping bombs like there was GRAVITY in space). This movie has about the same level of stupidity in the writting. SPOILER ALERT for below.The story itself has the link to the previous movie, namely that after the apes attacked the humans, the latter contacted some remnants of the US army to help. So far so good. The commander of a certain squadron of said US army apparently made his purpose in life from killing all the apes and especially Caesar. Ok too. 
But then things take a turn for the worse:
1. The commander captures eventually ALL apes and Caesar too, but instead of killing them (in line with his purpose in life), he prefers to use them as slave labor to build a rock wall (aaa... what???). Apparently he has his disagreements with his superiors and wants to make a stand there.. ok, but if his purpose in life was to kill all apes and he was in the position to do it, then what is this stupid mediocre motivation NOT to do it?? He changed his purpose in life to killing his superiors instead?? 
2. Then the whole escape plan of the apes... Initially when Caesar saw the compound there were armed guards everywhere, lights on the 2 pens, so a lot of security. The script makes us believe that there was only ONE guard which is lured in, taken out and then the apes take his keys and go rescue the ape babies without any problem. WHAT?? ONE guard.. only one. Really? Makes absolutely no sense.
3. Near the whole wall and actually inside the whole base there were 2 wagons filled with explosive mass (which Caesar uses to save the day). Several questions arise here: why was is allowed to be there in the 1st place? They were expecting an attack, so why leave that there?? And since we are talking about the attack, there was some heavy bombing before in which helicopters launched missiles into the base. How come these were still standing there, but were taken out by one grenade Caesar threw in??
4. The traitor... throughout the movie we see a traitor gorilla several times. He tortures Caesar, beats his friend etc.. typical torturer type.

643,jchs,A huge letdown,1,17 July 2017,Don't believe the hype surrounding this movie. This movie was awful. This movie was so much of a letdown that i had to write my first review on this website. The other two in the series are way better than this one. This movie was a bore! The planet of the apes with Mark Wahlberg was better than this one. I don't see how the script was even approved for this movie. The only positive was the CGI and that was wasted money since this movie sucked.,War for the Planet of the Apes

But this third movie is shiiiiiiite.How can a movie like this be made? Why are the writers insulting the intelligence of the audience?

646,goodeats17-774-266851,A Great End to a Greater Story,9,20 July 2017,"Morality has always been at the core of the Planet of the Apes films and I think that is why they have such staying power compared to other blockbuster films. There is war in this film and it's quite brutal, but it's not what reels us in, its the depth, the complexity and the vibrant tension created by the settings and characters of which this film is in no short supply. New angles are explored for familiar characters and the new comers are as equally complex, never letting us get to comfortable with who exactly is on the moral high ground at any given moment. This movie is indeed about a war, but not the one you think. Up until this point in the franchise, Caesar has been a pillar of upright character and leadership with little hints every now and then of some of his inner demons. This film is the culmination of that moral struggle, dancing between the light and dark sides of the protagonist and to watch the two battle it out as war for Caesar's soul is just as gripping as it is haunting.At the end of the day, and at the end of this trilogy, this is a morality tale. Throughout the three films, we are shown more and more how these animals are more human than we think, but also how like animals humans can be. Through these creatures we are shown our potential for both cruelty and kindness. That ultimately there's a bit of man in every ape, and a bit of ape in ever man.",War for the Planet of the Apes
647,Jamesabarber,Disappointment in the writers,6,4 October 2017,"I can't say that I was totally disappointed, but the first two movies did so much to tee things up that the third was a let down. The suspension of belief regarding how the virus mutated to now dumb down humans so that they can't speak is not consistent with the de-evolution of future humans. The comic relief by the one ape was SO unnecessary. If this was a PG movie targeted for kids... OK, but this had an older audience that watched the first two where this wasn't used. Plus the little girl in the film... I know they used her as a vehicle to deliver the virus... but they also poorly used her throughout. How did she come into the camp totally unseen by the guards you would expect to have been on the watch, plus they were out looking for others that might try to harm the camp. She didn't have any military training, she wasn't raised by rebels, she was a little girl... and one that was negatively affected by the ""dumbing down virus"". She has a ""SYMBOLIC"" flower that she gives to a dying character... all though it a cold winter season? Innocence???.... not all humans are bad??? Then the cliché ending with the bad ape finding inspiration in that single moment... and then YES... you guessed it he dies saving the day... REALLY? Then a Biblical Avalanche comes right in to the demise of the OTHER humans that destroyed the first set of BAD group... And ALL of them just HAPPENED to be on the ground celebrating 100 yards in front of their conquest... RIIIGGGHHHT.... Never seen such a CONCENTRATED celebration of a military force like that in a story...except in the Bible. And LASTLY... and ""WORSTLY"" :-) NO ONE realizes that Caesar is mortally wounded? They ride for days with him injured but no one knows? Come ON!!! This was nothing more than House Slaves versus Field Slaves, The Underground Railroadand a touch of Jewish Concentration Camps bungled together. I expected more. If this was a standalone movie I could have gone with the suspended belief about much of the science in this. But the first two did a good job laying the foundation and using their suspended belief cards that you couldn't really keep playing them... especially playing them kind of out of order... I guess more like have 3 Jokers in a deck of cards, or too many Wild cards in UNO.... you can play them and hope no one realizes it... but chances are someone will notice and be ticked off...I had to change some of my words... not quite sure why as I didn't use foul language.. so I hope it still comes across with the same general feel.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Having grown up at the start of the original Ape phenomenon, I was expecting this movie to set a new standard. The story line is shattered and hard to follow throughout the movie. The fact that I saw the movie in 3-D should have set expectations higher and probably influenced my disappointment. My biggest complaint was none of the characters were properly developed and thus adding to the confused scenes. However, there is one bright moment in the movie, the little girl, Nova.

651,stuartwalters6,"Poignant, emotive and very deep",9,22 August 2018,"A proportion of people seemed to have approached this movie with the classic summer blockbuster mentality, in which case you would inevitably be disappointed. This trilogy has never really labelled itself in that way and that is to the benefit of us all, however, perhaps the title may have be misleading.Complex characters, intense internal and emotional conflicts and ideological clashes form the 'War' over the typical big explosions and battles (although these do have a part in the movie). There is a central theme in the visuals and especially the score of a symbolic winter in the sense of frailty and ultimately death. Humanity is on the cusp of extinction and Cesar himself has the cumulative physical and emotional weight of the trials he has led his apes through. The substance behind this movie will be lost on some, the emotions which can be conveyed in an extended close up, a simple piano piece or the inflection of a voice are present throughout. The story of ending and new beginning is played out beautifully and lends itself to the religious symbolism of the book of Exodus.Thus the rarest of feats where a reboot stands firmly on it's own and a trilogy where every single movie has rightful praise is completed.",War for the Planet of the Apes

You can't possibly give a negative review just because you wanted to see a lot of blood on the screen and that wasn't the case? Overall, I enjoyed the movie. The action scenes were good, the ending was pretty emotional. However, some of the scenes were a bit too long and not necessary (which may be why some users think the movie is boring). I also don't understand why the writers felt necessary to introduce a little girl in the script. Sure, she was at the center of some cute scenes, but she was a bit redundant.

653,frasermcconnel-70795,Humans are still trying to defeat the Apes.....Vicious circle.,8,21 July 2017,"Conclusion of a movie trilogy has always been one of the most demanding tasks in the eyes of a movie director. Planet of the Apes movie franchise has returned in 2011 with a brilliant movie and an origin story of the Ape Caesar, who becomes the leader of the Ape revolution after his kind is facing a war with the humans. Second installment brought a more war-like plot with direct confrontations and the third movie sums it up, with beautiful story, inside conflicts and a terrific conclusion of the trilogy.Humans are still trying to defeat the Apes to gain complete control of the Earth. After a military operation by an group called Alpha-Omega nearly destroys the Apes' compound, Caesar (Andy Serkis) captures some humans but spares their lives, allowing them to send a message to their leader, called the ""Colonel"" (Woody Harrelson). In order to save more lives of his fellow species, Caesar proposes that they move out of the woods, but before that happens they face another strike by the military.While War for the Planet of the Apes manages to deliver a very intriguing story and a complex dilemma inside Caesar as well, the story develops pretty slow and there is no real dialogue inside the movie. That makes conversations between Harrelson's and Serkis's respective characters stand out.

657,abutterfield-71137,AN HONEST RATING,4,12 October 2019,"I was going to put 1 star to balance out all the 10 stars (which is unbelievable to me), but I decided to actually be honest about what this movie is--a horribly paced, poorly written, philosophical panderpiece; BUT with a great soundtrack, great visuals, and great acting by Andy Serkis and Woody Harrelson.
So, let me give the justifications for my statements.1. Horrible pacing. This is a 2hr. 20 min. movie with about 20 words and 2 plot-points. Plot point 1 is Ape prison break, if that sounds interesting to you, maybe you'll like this movie more than I did. Plot point 2 is Humans killing themselves/Nature killing them. They could have easily made this movie 45 minutes instead of 2hr. 20. might have been worth it if that was the case.
2. Poor writing. A. Harrelson's soldiers are apparently the worst soldiers in the history of cinema, as hundreds of apes escape with no one realizing anything. B. Little girl cares more about random ape than her father. C. Huge apes riding tiny horses, yeah okay. etc.
3. Philosophical panderpiece. The movie just screams that humans will kill each other/the earth if we keep going on the path we're on for 140 minutes. Like we get it, the writers think humanity is evil and nature is good. I'll recycle now I swear.Oh, and I know a title shouldn't be a reason to dislike a movie, but ""War for the planet of the Apes"" is the most misleading title of the decade. There was no war, there was a prison break and a 5 minute shootout that ended with...the avalanche winning.""Ape good. Human bad"" should have been the name of this movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes

661,crltct,Disappointed. And someone read the original book please!,6,15 July 2017,"Like others here. I was disappointed in this movie.All already seen, nothing new, and too simplistic. men are truly evil. apes are good. Even if cesar knows it's not quite the case and struggles, men really seem getting worst and beyond saving. Right... Now I liked the 2 previous prequels to the planet of the Apes story but this last chapter, not so much . The other 2 films were more nuanced and showed that Apes had the same faults as human and that there was good and bad in both. It also showed that getting rid of a bad ruler didn't necessarily mean that the new regime would be better. Just that one evil might replace another.. Even if it started with the noblest of intentions... But this last chapter is just completely going off course. Seriously disappointing. Also, what puzzles and annoys me is that everyone seems to ignore the fact that The original Planet of the Apes was a book written in 1963 by French author. Pierre Boulle. Note that It is the Eiffel Tower and Paris that the astronaut sees when he lands back on earth, not Washington DC and the statue of Lincoln. I am mentioning it because interestingly enough, the original French story is pretty much the complete opposite to the one portrayed in the Charlton Eston movies and that all sorts of things have been taken from the book, then twisted around and added to the prequel stories that have been filmed. See for yourself. The original story: A couple of astronauts Jinn and Phillis find in space a manuscript and read its contents. It tells the story of a group of human astronauts who land on a new planet (so they think). They find non=speaking, primitive humans hunted down by super intelligent Apes living in modern cities, flying planes etc.. Most of the human astronauts get killed by the Apes who hunt humans and experiment on them. One of the astronauts, Ulysses, survives and shows that he can talk. He is taken to be examined by a bunch of Apes scientists who want to run tests on him. They make him have sex with a primitive human female, Nova, to see what child they will conceive . But a couple of nice Apes scientists, Zira and Cornelius, protect Ulysses and tell him not to reveal that he is as intelligent as them until they can show him off at a scientific convention in front of all the Apes.Ulysses speaks at the convention and everyone is shocked. Cornelius decides to take Ulysses to see a10000 years old archaeological site. There they discover that men were ruling the Planet at some point and that the Apes civilisation is actually a perfect copy of the human civilisation . They do the same things humans did. In the meantime Nova has a child who is intelligent like Ulysses. Cornelius and Zira realise they will be seen as a threat to the Apes society and might be killed. They decide to help them escape on board of a spaceship. Ulysses, Nova and baby escape and land back in Paris. Ulysses is extatic at being home again. Someone wearing a helmet comes to their encounter. They take off their helmet. It's an ape...... Back to Jinn and Phyllis the couple of astronauts who found the manuscript and were reading the story: they don't believe a word of it. Jinn and Phyllis are both Apes... This means that all evolved humans have now probably disappeared. Now that would be a good movie when getting back to the main story. .. You know, one that actually sticks tothe book...

The scenery is beautiful, breathtaking at times, and even the scenery stuff done with CGI seemed very realistic. The apes themselves were wonderfully done, the details of the emotions on their faces, especially with Caesar, was impressive.I enjoyed the story line and found myself rooting for the apes almost immediately, and I definitely felt connected to the characters. Caesar's moral dilemmas and actions are completely relate-able, and I'm not ashamed to admit I teared up a couple of times. However, the humans are not painted as cold-hearted monsters; As the Colonel explains to Caesar, they have their own reasons for the actions that they take, and if the apes were in their position they may have done the same things.This movie was a great experience and I'm very glad I saw it in the theater, the huge screen definitely added to the excitement.",War for the Planet of the Apes

With that said, as nonsensical as it all is, it is nowhere near as bad as Disney's so-called Star Wars and is watchable. Yet, obviously it is made with no story and just to make money. 
Caesar the benevolent leader of the monkeys not only has to stand up for his genus, but now has a personal motive for revenge. What is more his family was killed by accident. The jarhead is so stupid that he meant to kill Caesar and killed his family instead. From there we have monkeys on horses, a monkey fleeing monkeys when he didn't mean to, the zoo monkey speaking English language even though we were told only special infected monkeys can do it, etc. For good measure, a little girl walks into the jarheads' barracks and moves around and does things and the stupid soldiers do not notice.
Whether these idiotic plot devices offset the action and special effects is up to you. I say the film is average at this point.A special note regarding the 'plot summary' left here by the retarded studio:""After the apes suffer unimaginable losses..."", The casualties were imaginable and actually minimal. The soldiers did not even attack in force.""Caesar and the Colonel are pitted against each other in an epic battle..."" There is no epic battle. Actually there is no Caesar/human battle anywhere.

Although James Franco was not an impressive choice for the ""RISE"" but i stayed for a totally different reason as i felt hooked onto the subtlety of the story . I recall witnessing a rare phenomenon of gasps and cheer from an entire theater full of people to the one final whisper at the end ...""Caesar is home"" and i instantly knew i am a die hard follower of this franchise.The story progressed with ""DAWN"" and it was worth watching Caesar still vulnerable to human suffering yet developing into a leader. Apart from being an excellent action film , it introduced a need to recognize a clear antagonist, beautifully delivered in KOBA . The premise that in time of crisis KOBA made perfect sense as a short term solution but still served as an antagonist in a bigger picture was clearly morphed into a message ""hate transcends species"" Without spoilers i can only recommend going into ""WAR"" after indulging the first two movies .... as it will be a more surreal experience than watching it as a standalone. Truly This movie is a third person person point of view into the abilities of the human race to be paranoid and draw inspiration for destruction on a simple premise of ""Difference"" whether its a difference of opinion, belief or species, and how it all serves as a wonderful excuse to kill anyone who feels different.Oh YES !.. there is one more amazing reason to watch ""WAR"" ..

After seeing this movie I felt the need to get my opinion out. So, what a long journey from the city of Misstreadedville with a final destination at Depressingland it was. You're telling me it's not enough that he is running for his life to save his people (depressing). His wife and one kid get killed (even more depressing). But wait, there's more, he and his people become slaves (thanks for reminding me about the worst tragedy in the history of the world). So here's our chance for an awesome battle with good apes and good humans. Epic action to see Caesar be his hardcore self, right? Nope. We see him battle no one and get shot by the person he spared. What an opportunity for mercy to be given back. So that's it right? Wrong again. We see super smart Caesar, not plug his wound and travel through the desert bleeding out. As a father he must have some small attachment to his soon to be orphan kid right. Wrong again.So finally we arrive at Depressingland.

Having said that, now is the time to give back and submit my first review of a movie, in this case, it is War for the Planet of the Apes. Let me start off by saying I am motivated to submit this review because I disagree with the rating assigned to this movie. I would have rated this movie a 4.0 and NOT a 7.9. The movie had redeeming qualities due to its incredible costumes. The scenery was very good but it may have been computer generated. My biggest complaint was how drawn out many of the scenes were. It was so boring it was difficult to get involved into the story. I was with a group of 3 couples, all of the men fell asleep sometimes as much as 3 times! None of the women fell asleep. But we all agreed that the movie was too slow and drawn out. I cannot remember the last time I have fallen asleep in a movie. Perhaps if I was awake, I would have enjoyed the movie more.

686,facebook-383-422257,"Technically Perfect, But Still Awful",3,16 July 2017,"I can count on the fingers of one hand the times I've walked out of a movie theater halfway through a movie. My attempt at watching ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is the third such occasion. And to think I had such high hopes! I can only conclude that everyone who rated the movie here, and all raving reviewers, saw a different cut, or more probably, an entirely different movie.Admittedly, ""War"" is is technically perfect, with awe-inspiring CGI, entirely convincing apes, and spectacular fight and battle scenes. If all a movie needed were good visuals and spectacle, ""War"" would deserve a 10, no discussion.But a good movie needs a convincing plot as well; believable characters with character development and relatable emotions; in short, good writing. And in that sense, this movie furthers the worrying trend of ignoring the need for content in favor of form.It starts in the opening sequence. A battle without a clear point or any reason to care about it, with its own annoying set of logic flaws, is followed by an interrogation scene. In this scene, the characters indulge in shameless exposition, the POWs spilling their beans without hesitation so that the viewer understands what it was all about. This bit actually made me squirm with vicarious embarrassment: lazy plotting and lazy writing taken to a whole new level. (A doomed attempt is made by the sound track composer to enhance this scene with music, but the score is empathic to the point of overbearing, a distraction and an annoyance.)The laziness of both the writers and the directors is also painfully apparent in every single chase and reconnoitering scene. On one occasion, an entire human army travels over a wide-open beach. The ape heroes chase the army, all four of them, on horseback, about a quarter- mile behind the last vehicle, and in plain view. A little later in the movie, they spy on the army's encampment, again up close and in plain view. And what to think of the time they sneak up on a compound, one of the apes says he believes this to be the army's base, and they simply ride in anyway? (Again, to the accompaniment of overbearing music.)SPOILER ALERT: And that particular scene gets worse once they establish that the compound is deserted. They encounter a single human, who despite the odds against him, and the two automatic rifles aimed at him, attempts to draw, and is gunned down. Immediately after, the apes find a little girl, and befriend her without apparent effort, even convincing her to come with them. The fact that they make her walk past the warm corpse of what can only be her dad is compensated, apparently, by the fact that the orangutan hands her a stuffed animals she's half a dozen years too old for. (Cue the overbearing violins.)This is but one example of how emotional development, interactions, and character arcs seem tacked on, unconvincing, fundamentally flawed. It's like the makers thought it sufficient to telegraph emotional development in established movie shorthand: look, here's the dead child, so now the dad is heartbroken and wants revenge! Look, the scary gorilla who killed her dad picked a flower for her, so now the girl will cry her heart out when the ape dies! (To the overbearing sound of an entire orchestra.)The low point in this lazy, unconvincing shorthand is the way the humans are depicted as the worst evil imaginable. Look, not only do they kill apes, they execute their own handicapped, and torture the apes they capture! This is made worse by the fact that in the first hour--the bit I saw--the only point of view is the apes', so the viewer doesn't even get to experience first-hand how and why these atrocities are committed. Maybe the writers thought this would make the horror and evil more believable; the opposite is true. And did I mention the overbearing music?I walked out on ""The man in the iron mask"" because I could not stand the cinematography and nonsense plot line. ""Babel"" made me physically ill. ""War"" is now the third movie I've abandoned. A waste of an hour of my life, a waste of ten of my euros.",War for the Planet of the Apes
687,Uncle-Feggster,Too many 1 star ratings....somethings up,8,15 June 2018,"Sometimes, when I read reviews about movies on IMDb, I see patterns in the writing. Similar text, similar structuring and similar indignant shouting. Read enough of them and you see that quite often there is an underlying reason why the reviews are marking a film so low. Be it political or religious. Very rarely is it actually about the quality of the film. More often it is about a personal issue that the reviewer has - and so he vents his anger in the only way that's he knows how - a screaming one star rating and a list of reasons why the film is the worst he has ever seen. Makes you wonder what kind of a strange person would do that.However, if you read past all the silly 1 star ratings you often get to the truth. And the truth as far as this film is concerned is that it is a cracker. It draws you in like none of the other ape movies - it's pacing is superb, the visual effect stunning. I would suggest that you ignore the ranting 1 star reviews and take them for what's they are - a few individuals with multiple accounts and strange views on the world.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I can't write too much about it because the movie looks great!Too bad that the story is stunningly stupid, though. I am a big fan of the first two parts of this sequel and I had high expectations against the final episode as well.Without going into all the details you will face: - Ceasar who's unable to understand the concept of war - a little girl who became instant friends of the apes, no matter that she was probably raised to hate/fear the apes and the monkeys just killed his father 5 minutes ago - a supposedly high security military camp where this girl could just walk in without anybody seeing her - a supposedly high security military camp which has unguarded, not exploded pipelines underneath where anybody can simply walk in - a supposedly high security military camp with ground thick as 10in so anybody can just dig up from underneath - evil Colonel building a completely useless wall - Jar Jar Binks of the apes. Thats on its own deserves a face punch! - a train wagon full of gasoline capable to destroy the entire military base. - Ridiculous distances traveled in minutes (from sunny, probably warm beach to snowstorm) - Ceasar got an arrow shot in the final battle. Then he travels with his tribe thru deserts and lands which should take at least a year. Once they arrived to a lake they will call ""home"", Ceasar dies from the bleeding arrow shot... stupid! That would have killed him in days if not hours.and so on, and so on.These ""little"" things completely ruined the movie for me and I only stayed because my girlfriend refused to walk out.

689,ConstantinePappas,An outstanding ending to an unexpectedly good trilogy,9,14 July 2017,"Planet of the Apes. Most people, including me had dismissed that franchise long time ago, so when Rise came out a few years ago I was surprised to see how wrong I was and most importantly how much difference in tone and in actual thought put to the script from its predecessors. Fast forward to War of the Planet of the Apes, and the 3rd part of the trilogy has managed to surpass the two other parts. If I could look at myself while watching the movie in third person, i would probably be at the edge of my seat, in suspense of what may be coming ahead in the next minutes of the movie.This movie is more centered around the apes, and rightfully so, since they have characters which have been slowly and meticulously been built throughout the previous two movies. It helps that the movies is more personal too, exploring the psyche in such a gripping way. So yeah, the apes had characters that you rooted for, their actions completely justified in their mindframe, and each unique in a satisfying way (not the usual, the one is the mind, the other the muscle and the third is the suave guy trope we see in so many movies). The CGI. Oh my. We have come a long way. Maybe the best we have seen in movies so far. And very important in a movie which runtime is mostly occupied by computerized apes; never was I taken out of the movie because of a fake looking chimp, which makes the whole experience all the more enthralling.As for the negatives, there is not much. The first half of the movie was flawless, the plot, direction, editing etc. Don't get me wrong, second part was great as well, but the transition from a situation to another was less smooth than the rest of the movie.Overall, an outstanding movie which makes the whole trilogy such a great story to watch. Acting, CGI, direction and storytelling are top notch. If you haven't, go see it! Before you do, watch the other two parts as well, it adds so much to the overall experience.9/10",War for the Planet of the Apes

I saw missed opportunities in bringing the story of all three films together (since this is the last of the trilogy), a few small insignificant rabbit trails that could've been left out, and it wasn't quite clear if this was just a tiny part of the world map with only this band of apes or if it was set in a post-apocalyptic timeline with this being one of many bands of apes in the world.

Many people rated 1 star and a few people reviewed War for the Planet of the Apes as ""the worst movie ever"". I completely disagree and remind them of Beneath the Planet of the Apes and some of the others from the original series.The new series was not the greatest thing I've ever watched in my lifetime, but it was certainly very good. The story line makes complete sense and the acting and animation is spectacular. The movies could definitely been a little better...maybe, but I like that they didn't do a scene by scene remake like Psycho with Vince Vaughn (which is also not the worst movie ever...close...there are a lot of bad movies out there), and, instead, they came up with a new series that is more of a prequel to the original series.All in all, don't listen to the dorks who wish they could even make something that ranks with the worst movie out there, but haven't the talent to even do that. See it for yourself and judge for yourself. I thought they were pretty good. I would even watch them again every once in a while.I also really liked that in Rise of the Planet of the Apes they briefly mentioned the space expedition that is a homage to the original Charlton Heston The Planet of the Apes.

695,danielpeters87,Beautiful scenery but lack of story,6,26 January 2018,"This movie was in my top 3 to watch as the previous movies were really good. After watching this I am left quite disappointed.First of all the scenery was great! But the story is just awful. It feels like it was rushed just to spit out the last part of the story. The storyline feels very shallow compared to the previous movies. It had it shares of good moments but I was never at the edge of my seat and I think it may be because of poor character development. You might know some of the characters from the previous movies but even they seem to be left out as only Caesar seems to be of importance. The others are just there because.. well to be honest I don't really know why most of them were there and that's a big problem in general with this movie.It felt like I was watching a 90's kids adventure movie at times. There was plenty of scenes where some of the good guys stood back watching someone else do things and almost functioned as commentators. Paired with an absolutely pathetic choice of music, yes I'm talking about the very long scenes of the apes escaping the ""Human zoo"". Again that reminded me of some half arsed 90's adventure flick. The part where they find the mute girl and Maurice notice she can't speak thy leave it for Caesar to communicate buy in the end of the moview Maurice can speak - like what the... was that about?!The story wants to tell the story of how the last humans dies leaving the planet for the apes. It does so by telling us that the virus that made the apes smart and killed most humans is now mutating leaving humans unable to speak or in fact the humans will end up as primitive as apes. It also imply that it may be curable. The girl is a mute because of this mutation but she learns how to speak sign language proving the theory wrong. So how did the humans die? Who knows!All in all this is a waste of time even for fans but I'll still give it 6 stars for the CGI and the scenery. The story and soundtrack deserves a 4/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
696,MoviesorSleep,What is Ape/What is Human,9,29 July 2017,"The great question sci-fi films pose (and I do believe these movies can be categorized as sci-fi) is: ""What does it mean to be human""? ""What separates us from other creatures?"" Woody Harrelson's character put it best in repeatedly saying, ""So emotional!"" to a chained Caesar for it is precisely that -- our capacity for emotion: compassion, empathy, and mutual understanding for the other is what is said to make us human. Colonel: ""There are times when it is necessary to abandon our humanity to save humanity"" Think of the other two films, it spends the majority of the time convincing the audience that apes are not savages and instead quite rational due to their increased intelligence, and therefore, emotional intelligence. They are able to form communities with families and friends developing trust, love, and the such. But it doesn't stop there, Caesar proves himself, repeatedly, to apes and humans that ""ape"" does not automatically equal savage. (Insert obvious Koba internal struggle here). This is proved in the first couple minutes of the film, where he spares the lives of soldiers, and later on where Caesar is suffering from a sort of PTSD from Koba's death. The film spends quite a bit of time on reactions mixed in with moments of silence. It is contrasted quite well with the dramatic music and epic battle scenes. The title may have mislead people since many assume with the word ""war"" in the title, the movie would have tons of ape vs. human fighting, but it cannot be reduced to that. Dialogue, mostly through (hand)signing amplified the serious and silent nature of suffering and uncertainty in war. It is powerful. Silence makes the audience pay closer attention to the precise facial expressions of the apes. Expressions of uncertainty in planning the next move, suffering in the cages many once lived in, and despair in light of losing a loved one. The moments of silence, the quiet, heart-wrenching moments as the camera zooms closer and closer to the individual's face, further humanizes the subject. Think of the moment when Caesar realizes the Colonel murdered his wife and eldest son, the score slows, the camera shows Caesar's tears and clenched jaw with exposed teeth. It cuts to Colonel's face in a rough, make-up camouflage. The Colonel thought he was killing Caesar. Who is shown as the savage here? I do not think the film can be reduced to humans = bad and now apes = good. Times of war operate in gray zones, and in film, it is the audience's ultimate decision in what is deemed as a moral act. Because we can't blame the Colonel for trying to save his people. We also can't blame Caesar for trying to save his community. But at what cost? If we abandon our morality, what are we but a creature? So the question is ultimately: What is Ape/What is Human Needless to say, it is a film worth thinking of a bit deeper, regardless of your perception of its political motive and religious and historical commentary, albeit, it does exist. It is beautifully shot, well acted (go Andy Serkis!), and a terrific conclusion to the Planet of the Apes reboot, prequel, and trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes
697,vicewsssixteen,"Not a solid movie, but it is great",8,6 January 2018,"First of all, a moment of silence for those who thought that this movie is a propaganda, and also for those who insisted that it must be a full on war movie because the title has the word ""war"". Now, despite having the urge to ramp up the vote by giving it a 10 because some unhappy people giving it a 1 without any constructive or logical review, I'll stick on to giving it an honest 8 stars. Think of some great war movies that doesn't show much of the war but the devastation war causes. Funnily, the people whining about the title made me remember Silence of the Lambs. Why doesn't that movie have any lambs that are silent? The pace of this movie is nice, the change of environments indeed makes it a journey. It is kinda generic around the encampment, but there was still a lot going on. The drama is also good, one of the main reasons people like it. Though some of the character decisions does feel like it only serves to progress the plot, it is not to the point that it felt ridiculous. The idea and dilemma it brings is indeed thought provoking, though it doesn't delve too deeply on it. Aside from those little goofs, there aren't much to criticise it about. This movie is about a post-apocalyptic war, not a modern warfare. It is also about the devastation of war. It may also be philosophical for those who searches that in a movie. Caesar's motivations shows family values(definitely not a communist propaganda). My first ever review in IMDB.

The story rushed forward at a quick pace.The villain! I love movies that pit man vs. man, or in this case, man vs. ape. I have never loved action movies where the villain is some malignant force. I like it when the protagonist and antagonist can look each other in the eye. Woody Harrelson was, as usual, excellent.The Easter eggs. There were tons of references to the original films.Depth. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me thankful for my family, it kept me on the edge of my seat, it made me love, it made me hate.Things I didn't like: I can't really think of any.

I understand those who dislike the anti-white/anti-Christian themes that are apparently there. I myself am a center-right white Christian and didn't see them except in one scene. They aren't as heavy-handed as the other reviewers are trying to make them out to be. From a storytelling standpoint, this film is fantastic. Efficient, eloquent, and kinetic, the story's pace is it's only weakness, more than made up for by the brilliant content and scenework. The combat scenes are the most epic thing since The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, and are made only more powerful because they are rare, only to be found at the very first scene and the last few scenes. However, every scene in this film is filled with conflict, the narrative drive of this film never misses a beat, even if not every scene is about a big battle. There is not a single expositional scene in the film save one, and that scene still moves the story forward, so technically it's not an expositional scene. From a technical standpoint, the film is brilliant, Every shot is nothing more than pure art, the CGI is the best I've ever seen, the set pieces are breathtaking, and the musical score, while subtle, does nothing but help the story feel tangible and authentic. The acting is phenomenal, particularly the performances of Harrelson and Serkis. The morally complex layout of the story is halfway to perfection, the haunting hallucinations of Koba represent Caesar's own mental dilemmas and his fear of becoming that which he swore he would never become. Although the film does fall short in being overly simple from a moral standpoint (ape = good, human = bad, almost without exception) it still does a fascinating job on showing the complex nature of Caesar's Moral Character. As this review clearly demonstrates, the film is very good.My real critique is not of the film, but the other reviewers here on IMDb, all of the 2-star and 1-star reviews are completely misleading and just plain disrespectful to the filmmakers involved on this project.These absurdly low reviews are meant for films like The Room or The Emoji Movie, if a film is just plain awful in every sense of the word, then it deserves a low rating. Not just whether you liked the movie or not. I humbly ask my fellow reviewers to put their personal feelings toward a film aside and just judge a movie based on its storytelling and technical qualities.Matt Reeves, Mark Bomback, Andy Serkis, and everyone else who was involved in some way in the film, I apologize for the total and absolute disrespect you are receiving for this film on IMDb, not that you care, being successful and all.

708,mozymervin,A poetry on screen,10,15 July 2017,"This is my second review here and my first one was Logan. I am never a person to give a review but Logan just blew my mind that I couldn't resist giving it a review. I thought I would never again do it and then I watched War for the Planet of the apes and couldn't resist as it totally blew my mind. It's one of the best movies I've ever watched and my favorite trilogy and it overtook my previous favorite, The Matrix trilogy(yup. I enjoyed all 3 Matrix movies. I don't care about your opinion).This movie has amazing characters and depth in them, in an era where most movies are just for fun and totally forgettable after a view, (don't get me wrong, I do like those movies and have fun, but that's it... I forget them very soon...) crammed up with uninteresting jokes for the first half and some engaging action in second half or try to be pretentiously deep. But Planet of the apes is organic, the characters grow with you, you bond with them and you care for them. The main character is a Christ figure who is more humane than humans and you sympathize for him and his journey and suffering. All the other characters are just as organic and you soon form a bond with them. The little human girl adds so much heart and soul to the movie when it's necessary. And all the metaphorical biblical references in the movie, just makes the tale so much more poetic.The actors have done a top notch work. Andy Serkis nails Caesar once again. It's amazing how much emotion and depth can be portrayed through Mocap. All the actors who played the apes have done an amazing job of showing emotions without words and so is the little girl who played Nova.This is one of the rare movies that'd come on screen occasionally. I didn't expect such a masterpiece to come out so soon especially after I witnessed Logan. I wish more movies of this caliber come to cinemas. This has heart, soul, emotions and it is definitely a poetry on screen. Do not miss it... And if you don't like my review, I don't care and I've two words for ya...",War for the Planet of the Apes
709,tannerokeefe-47677,Great Conclusion,8,2 November 2017,"Caesar is one of the best characters in cinema history, seeing him evolve from an infant till adulthood.

Bravo Andy Serkis on your portrayal of Caesar.",War for the Planet of the Apes
710,davidhawley-10709,Heavy handed self-loathing La-La Land,6,1 September 2021,"Humans bad, apes good. This thesis sums up the first half of the movie, harped on so heavily and in such a clichied manner that I lost interest in continuing. And apes, of which chimps are the most violently aggressive and unpredictable. La-La land for the self-loathing.Having said that, the movie looks fantastic.",War for the Planet of the Apes
711,Nikopolous,Planet of Boredom,2,11 August 2017,"As others have said: One of the most boring hence worst movies I've ever seen. I was contemplating leaving the cinema, starting after half an hour in. Totally disappointing. I liked parts 1 and 2, this part however I wouldn't watch again, even for free.What really made parts 1 and 2 interesting for me was seeing the backstory of ""How the (original) Planet of the Apes came to be"", expecting this movie to deliver the epic conclusion and, as the title suggested, the ""War for the Planet of the Apes"": Apes and humans struggling for supremacy over the planet. Well, it didn't deliver any of this.Instead, the movie started as a road movie (i.e. walking movie), mixed with an ""arch-nemesis revenge"" story and concluded as a very cumbersome ""prison escape"" story.They could have replaced all the apes with zombies / aliens / whatever, it wouldn't have had any influence story-wise. This is not a Planet of the Apes movie. It's the poorly told story of some people going after other people, and some of these people happen to be apes.Extra points deduction for: Inconvincing arch-nemesis; Waste of great character potential; Awkward sidekicks; Especially stupid, cheesy finale.Extra plus points for CGI / motion capturing fulfilling the expected standards.",War for the Planet of the Apes

And what is with all the hate?I don't understand it at all..

713,thisalikeblack,This is a true anti war movie,10,4 August 2017,There are a lot of thought provoking themes in the subtext of the movie which seem to be very problematic for a lot of writers of commentaries. But they will not tell you the reason for their hate-comments. I think the movie shows how idealism can be miss-used and how humans are fighting each other for some ideology and as what kind of ideology Darwinism is used for violence and domination. This is a true anti-war-movie to think about the reasons why people destroy and avoid to ask. It shows destroying each other prevents asking questions for causalities. And this is too much for a lot of idealists who never asked their own ideals. This makes it become a masterpiece and it is deeply produced and directed with a lot of empathy. Everything on screen is well arranged and played. It is a movie about human kind is going too far and preventing to learn from mistakes.,War for the Planet of the Apes
714,belindanguyen,Gut wrenching and riveting!!,10,18 July 2017,"This was honestly out of this world. I spent the entire movie on the edge of my seat, eyes glued to the screen-- albeit a lot watery. This movie was a tearjerker for me, being a long time fan that had watched Caesar since his first movie. I cried during so many moments and at times the film was even able to effortlessly bed in some humor w Bad Monkey making me laugh through my tears. This film held me captive from the beginning to end and my heart was in it completely.There were some questionable parts, (small spoilers!) for instance the very last scene where Caesar traveled very far with an injury and then didn't bleed out until the end of the journey. But I'm gonna pretend that Maurice tried to aid him along the way but the wound couldn't be healed with all the traveling.* (End of spoiler!)*A lot of people focused on those technical difficulties but if you look at the film as a whole, you see so many moments when your heart just flies out to the characters. Caesar is compelling, and the bond he shares with other characters are what pull you in. He's truly a tragic hero, never getting to enjoy and live in happiness of which he's given so much to give to his people and this film with its characters has such a deep place in my heart. A few of the people have given it bad reviews and I feel like they haven't watched the other films and don't have a full idea of what's going on; they just saw the trailer and decided, ""cool. Some apes shooting guns!"" I saw a reviewer saying something about how ridiculous it is that apes are more intelligent than humans, not possible! *gasp* the point of the film wasn't to be unrealistic and claim that. The virus that killed off the humans is the virus that was given to the apes by a scientific department researching a cure for for Alzheimer's-- which means altering the issues with memory and the virus very clearly went above and beyond what it was supposed to do when they tested it on the apes. Hence the extremely heighten intelligence in Caesar and his clan. Some have even said that there wasn't enough war and the movie has the word war in it for a reason. The apes had been in war for 10 years. They fought many battles throughout the movie as well. But it's unrealistic to expect them to running towards guns and bombs repetitively when what they're trying to do is keep their people alive and fighting the battles just to get by until the day they can get away-- the apes are peaceful. It's bashed for having too much action but then in the same breath ridiculed for not having enough war. I hope you see the irony in this. I also saw an argument that voiced the ridiculousness of the avalanche that killed most of the humans while the apes survived. The whole point of this film was to showcase how science has taken these animals and evolved them in such a way that they now even overcome and surpass humans. *(spoiler)*And the point is honed in one last time they show the apes living leaping and by climbing up mountain trees big enough to withstand the mountain avalanche; apes are stronger and the better part of evolution. *(end of spoiler)*Take some time and watch the other two movies, they're just as riveting and heartbreaking as this one. This has become one of my favorite films of all time, and the first film of which I'd gladly hand my first 10/10 rating for any movie I've ever watched to.",War for the Planet of the Apes

718,rxhuang-26790,Don't waste your money,1,17 July 2017,I was so tempted to walk out of this move after the first ten minutes. I stayed because I was with a group of friends. The plot is stupid. You literally feel no emotions for anything going on in the movie. The only feeling you get is boredom. The incoherence in the movie was unbearable . The movie tries really hard to humanize the apes to the point you feel like you are watching a day time soap opera through most of the film and not even a good one either. This movie was torture.

The whole film is a bunch of apes walking across land to a monkey zoo and picking up a comic relief character on the way. Firstly, The whole plot makes zero sense. Secondly, The title is a blatant lie. There is hardly any ""war"". It's more of a ""Escape from an exhibit"" movie that takes 2 hours of walking to find.Sure, the CGI is good, but that seems to be what they put their $150 million budget on.

There was nothing that would stand out to me that would say ( got to see this in 3D) You can pay a couple of bucks less and enjoy the movie in regular format. The story line is excellent with a few new faces and even a little bit of comedy.

723,iirockythecat,I do not see the 'War' in this film,2,24 July 2017,"So, I have a bit to say about this film. So I don't sound like an asshole, let's start off with he redeeming qualities of this film:The animation is nice.That's probably it.Now, with everything else.This film is just awkward, slow, and confusing.The girl character is just annoying, and does literally nothing useful within the film. Never have I hated a character this much who doesn't even SPEAK! Her relationships are all over the place, and honestly, she's just annoying and clearly there just for parents to 'relate' or something stupid. She can clearly express emotions, as shown with the death of that gorilla guy I didn't care about, but she doesn't even mourn the death of her own father! She's only known this group for about a day or so(??), and she sobbed during this gorilla's death when he didn't even speak to her! She's just useless, and honestly, I would enjoy the film more without her.Next, the 'War'. There's only one small battle between the monkeys and the humans, and then a large one between the humans. This movie should be 'The Travels of the Apes'. The comic relief is, if anything, annoying and awkward, and I was surprised to hear people laughing at his shitty jokes. Ceasar's death made me and a few other laugh our asses off, along as when he literally got BLOWN UP. It's hard to be able to get close with these characters when everything feels like it's going at a snails pace and when their dialogue just feels repetitive and annoying.All in all, I do not enjoy this movie. Fans of the franchise may enjoy this, but I do not care for this film or most of the others.

Yes, this is likely a political message - an accurate one, too. Nevertheless, there is nothing communist about this movie.

727,ahock-84096,The Law of Nature,9,16 July 2017,"The New Apes trilogy is definitely one of the most underrated group of films to come out in the 2010s, with War (maybe) bringing the trilogy to an exceptional close, as Caesar must lead his group of Apes out of the clutches of the evil Colonel and the Alpha-Omega army. In short, the war between humans and apes has been waging on for two years. After a very brutal battle, Caesar decides to let a group of humans go, yielding to devastating results including the murder of his wife and son. Enraged, Caesar embarks on a mission to avenge those he loves, but leaves his group of apes to fend for themselves. As Caesar and the apes are captured by the Alpha-Omega army, Caesar must choose between his animal instincts of revenge or to save his apes.War for the Planet of the Apes is a must-see spectacle for both franchise fans and average viewers. The writing takes the movie beyond a regular summer blockbuster and turns it into a thoughtful and intense adventure, as the ideas of choice and even insanity are explored. Matt Reeves deserves a lot of credit, as he is one of the best directors and writers that excels in character exploration and development, and he is also backed up by yet another expectation defying motion capture performance by Andy Serkis (please at least nominate him, Academy). Serkis' performance reflects everything in this tortured character, as he struggles inwardly between avenging his family and deciding what is best for his people. Reeves' direction and the mind blowing special effects also add to the experience that is this film, as well as the music - really adds to the emotion and tension of key moments.Two problems I had were the character of Nova and the ending (beware - major spoilers ahead). Nova is a child affected by the simian flu and is unable to talk....and it pretty much stops there. Nova really did not seem to have a point to the film, besides a kid seemingly just thrown in for the emotional sway. Another problem I had was the ending. While it is fantastic to see the apes reach their home and Caesar's death, there are still many questions that need answered, and with this film being marketed as the final movie in the trilogy, it seems those questions may go unanswered. Who will rule with Caesar gone? What will Nova's role be as a human in an ape culture? Answers would have been nice to give a little more closure.Despite these very small faults, War of the Planet of the Apes should not be missed. It is a thought provoking, emotional thrill ride that will not soon be forgotten. In a world of cinema that seems to be taken over by Marvel and terrible sequels (see The Last Knight for reference), War will give you both spectacle and a story to back it.",War for the Planet of the Apes

729,asilverstein16,Very satisfying end to the trilogy,8,18 July 2017,"The third installment of the Planet of the Apes reboot series is directed by Matt Reeves who helmed the second film in the trilogy, as well as directing Cloverfield and co-creating the TV show Felicity with JJ Abrams. The movie begins where the second left off, with Caesar leading his clan of genetically enhanced apes and struggling for survival deep in the woods of California. Caesar is played by Andy Serkis, who became the trope namer for performance captured characters after his acclaimed portrayal of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies. Caesar and the apes plan to find a new home away from humans and avoid any more bloodshed but they are repeatedly attacked by a rogue military faction, Alpha Omega, led by the Colonel, played by Woody Harrelson, who personally murders Caesar's wife and eldest son during the attack. Caesar sends his clan to relocate but stays behind with his three most trusted comrades in order to get revenge on the Colonel. An outbreak of the Simian Flu is now causing surviving humans to become mute and regress back to a primitive mentality. The Colonel favors executing anyone afflicted with the virus which has caused him to become an enemy of the military, who have ordered his death because others believe a cure is still possible. The Colonel and his band of loyal followers plan to use the apes as slave labor in order to fortify an abandoned weapons depot and fend off the rival military forces. Caesar and his entire clan are eventually captured and held prisoner by the Colonel and must find a way to escape before they finish their labor and are no longer needed and before the inevitable battle between rival military factions. For a movie with very few human actors the acting was superb, nearly every ape character is portrayed by an actor with performance capture technology, rather than using purely CGI apes. It was interesting to see the ape characters portrayed as the viewpoint characters and audience surrogates, forcing you to root against your own species. The ape audience surrogate plot device works because the apes and Caesar succeed in winning your sympathy by the end, mainly because the protagonist is depicted as the ideal hero in that he is compassionate, highly opposed to killing, revenge, war, and is extremely forgiving. Caesar can ultimately be interpreted as a modern expy for Moses in that he leads a persecuted people to the promised land. I had a few very minor criticisms of some of the plot devices used for example the supporting character, Bad Ape who was a very unsubtle token plucky comic relief stock character reminiscent of Jar Jar Binks. It was a bit of a contrived coincidence that the Colonel is able to not only kill Caesar's family but do it personally and there is also a pretty out of nowhere deus ex machina avalanche that neatly wraps things up a little too conveniently. Overall the movie was brilliantly directed, acted, and had excellent action sequences and character development making it well worth paying to see it in theaters and a very satisfying end to the reboot trilogy.",War for the Planet of the Apes

731,monkeycracker,A movie done right and a must watch ( contains some spoilers),10,19 July 2017,"War for the planet of the apes ( 2017) SPOILERS War for the planet of the apes is a thrilling and a masterful ending to a brilliant trilogy. It is not often seen that the sequels become subsequently better than their previous instalments which in this case is done masterfully. At the beginning of the movie you instantly notice the perfection of the sounds , the quality of the CGI and an intense beginning to a movie done justly. The story continues nearly close to the end of the previous movie keeping in mind that u have watched them and know what is going on at the current moment. The story is written brilliantly , keeping the viewers at the edge of their seats wondering what more could the writers possibly throw in? The scene where Caesar's family gets killed shows us that we are exactly like the apes; that we have our own families , our own weakness which can expose us at any given moment . It shows us that we are no different than the apes which are not burdened by any technology although adopting some of the humans weapons in the movie. We can also link some of the problems in the movie to our own real life troubles. As Koba divided the humans and apes so did Islam divide humanity as we see Islamophobia spreading rapidly in our world. The story in the movie progresses at a marvellous pace always keeping us interested in what is going on. By the end of the movie we actually see how divided Caesar is between helping humans or going to war with them but we also see a third threat humans who wish to destroy both apes and the forces of rebel humans. Woody Harrelson's role in this movie is nothing short of perfection. This is one of the best roles he could have possibly had and i dare to say even an award worthy one. You can see that both the humans and the apes give valid points in regards to protecting their own but no one is actually in the right here. Humans are just smarter animals with better ways of killing. To put it this way : this is a must watch which in my opinion is a solid 10/10 and possibly one of the best movies i have ever watched with a gritty theme and the possibility of an Oscar.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Wow this movie was just too slow, I mean the effects were outstanding but the story just couldn't keep me in it, I loved the last two Ape movies and I'm really disappointed in this one, I don't understand how it got such great ratings, I'm starting to think people are getting paid for these reviews.

733,bladenkwilliams-56981,War for the Planet of the Apes as a whole,6,24 July 2017,"I went into this movie with expectations from the last two movies and was let down. Look at the movie by itself however, it starts off really strong describing what has happened to lead up to this turn of events in the film and really making everything easy to understand. The movie falls off however as it keeps going, we start off with the humans attacking the ape village and then Caesar heading out for revenge for his family, in the beginning these were really promising as they looked and felt really well done, However as more plot points are revealed it starts to fall off as it tries to express too many things at once. They really pull you out of the experience of the movie with certain things the characters do even for talking apes with human like intelligence some of the things they do just seems highly unlikely. I commend the movie for its strong symbolism of the German concentration camps and really how the army treated the apes like the Jewish populace during world war 2 it all felt very similar. The CGI was amazing as nothing every really looked fake, the apes in the film looked as if you were to go to a zoo and see actual apes. The weakest point of this movie is the character Nova, they build her up as a character and make you expect that she will be some big plot device during the movie but then they just leave her as some little girl being raised by apes and it disappointed me. As an ending it felt somewhat rushed and did not feel right as the entire army just gets whipped out by an avalanche and the apes make their way safely to the desert. As a stand alone movie it has some potential but as an ending of a trilogy it feels weak and lackluster to be an ending.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Stayed away from gossip, rumours and early reviews (critic and other) to keep myself as unbiased as possible. Liked 'Rise', liked 'Dawn' more, but I LOVED 'War' more than either. The motion-capture is a 10/10 knockout, WETA and Andy Serkis are legendary at this point. It's hardly worth talking about story or plot as this is definitely placing itself as the final in the trilogy rounding off the apes journey. Still enjoyable but slower paced and methodical while they emphasize subtlety, expression and minimal dialogue.I am amazed and then disappointed that there are so many ~1 star reviews. Don't pay them any attention however, most are either missing the point or wanted an entirely different experience.

The Empire is attacked by a violent Christian cult whose theology is based on Charles Manson's interpretation of the Book of Revelation and whose leader, Woody Kurtz, has gone insane because of his massive marijuana intake and his isolation in the heart of darkness. Caesar and his legion fend off the attack and, because of a transvaluation of values, treat their prisoners with Christian mercy instead of Roman barbarism. But Woody is a natural born killer and, while repelling down a waterfall in his leisure, attacks Caesar's family. Following in the footsteps of John Wayne Ethan Edwards, Caesar swears revenge, so with three other searchers he tracks Kurtz to his jungle encampment. Along the way, the four establish an interracial friendship with a human girl called American Innocence (but renamed Chevy by the wise Orangutan, Professor Maurice) and encounter an aged chimpanzee, Comic Relief, whose voice resembles Mr. Peterson from the Bob Newhart Show. They arrive at Kurtz's base, only to realize that they've travelled back in time to a strange amalgam of Nazi-occupied Poland, the antebellum South, Ancient Egypt, Roman Judaea, and Vietnam, where Caesar's subjects have been captured and made into slave labourers that are charged with building Volkswagens and Donald Trump's wall. Caesar is captured and subjected to 39 lashes, but before he has to perform the Stations of the Cross, the apes are able to escape through the catacombs. There is a final showdown between antagonists, where Kurtz, realizing that he has been infected by a blanket laced with smallpox, whispers ""the horror, the horror"" while grooving to psychedelic 60s rock music. Again, Caesar asserts his identity as an Übermensch, re-embraces Christian mercy rather than revenge, and lets Kurtz live. But Kurtz has become convinced that he's Kurt Cobain, and decides that it's better to burn out than fade away. Caesar escapes. The Union Army arrives to finish the destruction of the Southern Death Cult, but after doing so, they turn on the oppressed apes. At this point, Jah intervenes and in one of whimsical judgements, destroys the servants of Babylon. Caesar leads his people on an exodus through the desert, and after forty years of wandering and surviving on manna, they reach the Jordan River across which they can see Canada.",War for the Planet of the Apes
739,joelfooramos,War for the Planet of the Apes (a great ending to a great trilogy),9,2 August 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is directed by Matt Reeves, the same man who directed Cloverfield and stars once again Andy Serkis leading the apes to a war against the last of mankind. This is the ending of the trilogy, we had Rise followed up by Dawn and now we have War. And this last chapter in the trilogy, I have to say it's the best one. War without a doubt its a fantastic and great movie. The performance by Andy Serkis is again phenomenal! Outstanding! But we have to give major props to the creators behind the CGI. With every Apes movie, the CGI kept improving and this film has the best CGI I have seen in a any movie. It has some very intense moments, and some very sad moments along the way that definitely had me in tears. The action sequences are great. They have nothing big about them. Really, there is not that many flaws that the movie has. I think the issue there is with the film is that it might drag sometimes. It was the only flaw I had with the film. I think it's a great film to a great trilogy, well directed, well written, good score. I am going to give War for the Planet of the Apes 9/10",War for the Planet of the Apes

This movie was full of racism against white people. In the middle of the movie we are becoming aware of Commander's story(woody Harelson) and all of the reason why this commander want to kill the apes. reason is really simple that apes caused the virus which makes human become like ape. this is so clear that any species which can think and have ability of choice will destroy anything what kills it. and that's not all it is an complete analog of racism. I don't really know what the stupid script author was thinking, but it was like ""if you want to create peace and equality into different people you need to destroy the dominant species in this case white people or you need to make them be as stupid as you are"". this is a fact that movie was about that. the humanity was destroyed in the end of the movie and only one who has survived was stupid girl which was like connection of this apes because this girl was stupid as an ape an movie makes you feel that that is right. why is it right why it is needed to reverse developing process to make peace. Also I was wondering why were not there any black soldiers, the reason is very simple because the black people analog were apes, this political correctness ruins everything and I am really exhausted with the movies where the racism is always the main idea of script what the rubbish movie was that don't waste money or time for that.",War for the Planet of the Apes
741,walterjackwhite,"Should have been named ""Alternate Planet of the Apes""",6,17 December 2017,"I like the CGI, I do. It's well done.
I also like the concept of this and the last two Planet of the Apes ""reboot"" titles.What I don't like is that this particular movie seems to have been crammed together at the last minute(like some highschool science project that was put off till it was due tomorrow), and if you know the Planet of the Apes timeline, it doesn't fit in at all, particularly with Nova and Cornelius.So... Where to start? The background to the human conflict doesn't make sense at all. If there was a new version of the virus and there was no way to cure someone of it because all the everyone that can are already dead, then yea... in this particular situation, I'm pretty sure that 99% of everyone in this time period would be behind killing people that fall victim to the new virus in order to prevent it spreading. It WILL come naturally. And you can't gloss it over with some social justice BULLCRAP that will be non-existent in a survival-of-the-human race situation. If there is a new threat, ur done... Guaranteed. GG, the end...In the final battle, not all the last of the humans are killed off. That movie tries to say that after it shows a couple of bases where humans will be, even after the avalanche. There will also be lots of survivors of the avalanche... Just saying... Sooo... This suggests that the movie is just trying to rush everything in like a highschool project that was done at the last minute...The apes are actually dumb as rocks tactically throughout the entire series. It is a miracle that they make it for a few hundred years as.... smart... Knowing that, we know that Nova and Cornelius can not exist in this movie either... Throwing them in as a anecdote was cool at first, then you get mad after knowing(and realizing) that there is no way in hell that they can exist in this movie...Lastly, Woody Harrelson was a great pick for this character. Unfortunately the character itself SUCKS... Why would you build a wall knowing that your opponent has helicopters? Makes no sense.... Alot of this movie makes NO SENSE....But the CGI was badass, top notch.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Pacing, acting, introduction and writing are at the top of what I've seen since a long time!I missed it in theaters, because the second opus was bad (to my personal view), even if I have always supported the Planet of the Apes series ! I regret it sorely now that I have seen this (last?) opus.If hollywood and overall audiences were able to see true great films, this one is by any standard one of those great film that brings heart before actions, do not push science where it is not needed, has authentic character and though is not exempt of mistakes and caricature on the side of the colonel, it never feels so pushy that you disconnect with the movie.So, here is my militant 10/10 and a big thank you to Matt Reeves for making a ture Planet of the Apes as we longed for so long (40 years roughly, 17 years for others!) !",War for the Planet of the Apes

Did they even think about anything?If these apes are so smart tactically, like they showed in the previous film, then why are these super smart apes chasing a caravan of armed soldiers with absolutely no cover across a wide open snowy lake? Black apes, white snow. No, they won't be seen. Do they really think no one has a mirror in their military vehicle or just hoping no one will look back?There was so many instances of retarded shots where the soldiers can easily see and kill the main character from their vantage point, but there he is just walking around/among/past them, and we're supposed to believe that trained soldiers just can't see him.Woodie Harrelson's acting was the worst I've seen yet.",War for the Planet of the Apes
750,fourspaced,Miserable,4,10 July 2021,"To begin: I am an avid fan of the first 2 films!!The first hour or so of this one was a fun ride. Heartbreak and adventure. And to see the band of 3 or 4 apes on horses going out to find Harrelson was great. Really great dynamics, and ""bad ape"" is a unique character with a type of comic relief that the first 2 films lacked.Woody Harrelson is typically a great actor. His bland presence in War, however, left me completely floored. Perhaps his glance back at Caesar in the opening scenes was a good moment, but after that, it went downhill.When the apes are captured, we first saw him utter a few uninspired, 2-worded lines at Caesar. In following scenes, he proceeds to waddle around with a stale scowl, unsure of what to say. When we finally see a dramatic encounter between he and Caesar, his monologue is morbid and underwhelming. Too much explanation for a one-sided character left me half-asleep - when I wasn't cringing from the badly written murder dialogue.We know that the apes are struggling for lack of food and water, but only because it is explained to us. We don't see the struggle of those who are suffering. Even when Caesar is standing up for the ape that is being whipped, the only one who shows any emotion is the female leader who gets everyone to work again.Very robotic performances from everyone.The entire 2nd half of this film feels forced and it dragged on. It's a real shame.",War for the Planet of the Apes
751,damincholv,A Grand End Of An Unexpectedly Brilliant Trilogy,9,19 August 2021,"The entire Planet of the Apes series features distinct tones and themes for every movie. The finale delivers an equally different, beautiful film that ends Ceasar's journey in this franchise.Although the movie seems to be a road trip through the country type deal, with breathtaking landscape shots and color schemes that accentuates the grimy tone, it quickly shifts into more of an ""Apocalypse Now"" film with the themes of American imperialism and madness of war. Also taking clear inspiration by having the main antagonist be named Colonel and even graffiti that says ""Ape-calypse Now.""If the first one was about the rise of Ceasar, with undertones of animal cruelty and ethical science, and the second movie had a compelling story with multiple plotlines and constant political tension, this movie serves the journey of legacy as Ceasar makes more sacrifices to keep his kind safe, all while battling the grief of losing his wife and son and the fear of becoming like Koba, the enemy of the second movie. It's fitting that the final movie be one of introspection as Ceasar reflects on his past life as his story comes to a striking end.There's lots of interpretations for this movie, such as if you watch this with a religious perspective, you can perceive things such as the avalanche a biblical storm for crucifying Ceasar. Even one of the end shots of the apes being freed can be seen as another depiction of the Israelites being freed.The movie loses a point as the pacing becomes dragged on once Ceasar is captured, and the complete shift of the movie as a whole was not what I had hoped it was. Instead of being a journey of finding oneself, the focus is diverted instead into a prison escape plot. It doesn't take away from the movie, and Ceasar still does go through an arc, but it does make it not a masterpiece in my eyes. The themes are a bit muddled once this tonal shift occurs as well.The cinematography in this movie is beautiful. It's clear inspiration from older western movies is actually refreshing to see and is commendable for its boldness in this modern film. Even though this movie may be considered less captivating than the second one, it's emphasis on cinematography and dark atmosphere will have a deeper draw for certain viewers like myself.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Perhaps the movie industry has an army of their own... IMHO, It is easier and more honest to admit you made a bad movie and move on.So what is bad about it? first of all - the story, it tries too much to support Caeser's inner struggle. If the colonol knew the location of the cave why come with 3 other soldiers? you guessed it, so he can set the course of Caeser's metamorphose to the dark side. The father in the woods? again - a plot device - to make Caeser a killer. The non-talking girl? someone to take the position of a caring person in a world of mindless thugs soldiers. Give her 30 seconds to morn her father just so she can casually joins his killers - unnatural! His killers by the way are 400 lbs. gorillas riding a horse which by any known recommendation should carry up to 240lbs. I don't know, it bothered me...

It isn't terrible, but think it could have been betterI think there is too much suspension of belief that is required to make it enjoyable (although POTA in general requires a lot of suspension of belief. This one was too much). For example, the Colonel has spent two years trying to destroy the apes (who are portrayed as very formidable in the first two installments). Yet suddenly he was able to capture all of them and chooses to enslave them to build a wall that will supposedly keep out another army of humans? Made no sense whatsoever. Why would he keep the apes alive? The logical thing was to kill all the apes, not keep them around. The only point of enslaving them was to further the allegorical plot of Caesar and the Book of Exodus.And the final battle/escape? You defeat two well armed armies by blowing up a single gas tanker?

780,farid-at,Who actually thinks Harrelson can act?,3,5 October 2017,"You have a neatly-made, almost flawless production of action beautifully constructed around drama of beastly sociality, and the better half of the film goes down the drain because this guy cannot act.He's not remotely believable in embarrassingly obvious scenes. His face doesn't show it, his voice doesn't show it. He's just none of the personalities that we only hear about from a detached dialogue. If it weren't for the dialogue you couldn't say if he has a role. He is not a depiction of someone without his humanity, as this might be the only excuse for such a lame promotion, but simply a failure of truly depicting a persona of humanity gone wrong, of perhaps abnormality, excess, craze or emptiness. He is just something out of the story who's been paid to walk around and talk what's in the script. It's like tearing down part of a classical painting and saying it's part of the painter's work. He's a hole. He's a void. So, unfortunately is the outcome.But Harrelson is a smart guy out of the picture, I guess, and so must be his agent, because he gets paid to feed off the previous work accumulating into this franchise's brand, all without doing sh*.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I'm not going to say much other than the fact that they killed it with this movie...and I mean it in the most positive way possible. I'm a die hard fan of digital and practical effects and I've always held Jurassic park as THE BEST movie that perfectly balanced both practical and CGI. However, this movie ( and its predecessors ) rely heavily on CGI through Mo-cap and to finish it this movie has gone way ahead. I literally forgot that they were CGI. It was amazing.

All I kept think is how he looks so much like Gollum lol. They were definitely gunning for your emotions. I mean that one Gorilla got stabbed and died on the spot. Seriously?? They were getting shot multiple times in the first one and they kept fighting! Caesar was shot with a crossbow in the chest and had enough strength to travel a long distance, and yet a huge buff Gorilla gets stabbed by a small bayonet and dies on the spot? And then we get to be ""entertained"" by Caesars facial expressions for 10 minutes as he mourns said Gorilla. You gotta be kidding me :( I'm falling asleep here. Also Caesar wasn't showcasing his brilliance anymore, he was just so emotional. The only good thing about the movie is Bad-ape. He was hilarious and relate-able.

I watched in top class 4K, Dolby Atmos & 3D cinema. 3D effects are almost negligible.I know that audience will have huge hopes after watching the previous episode 'Dawn of the Plant of the apes' as the last dialog of the movie from Caesar is ""The war has already begun"".I really don't understand how this movie got an average IMDb rating of 8.",War for the Planet of the Apes

787,webber16879,"1 star reviews, please...",7,22 September 2018,"I'll reiterate what others have said, and probably more eloquently:This film does not deserve a single 1 star review, let alone the score of them that are on here. A 1 star film for me is basically unwatchable, whereas this film is quite the opposite.The story, while maybe more simplistic the the previous film, is still engaging and has a notable urgency throughout. At no point did my attention sway. 
The acting is again superb, with Andy Serkis the standout. He really is a gift to cinema and an actor whose influence and historical importance will be more and more acknowledged as the years and decades progress. 
The visual effects are again ludicrously good. It's borderline photo perfect. Maurice in particular made me question whether rhwyd actually used a deall animal instead! 
Also, although the score is sparsely used (more on that later) it was impactful when utilised and very impressive. If I had one small criticism it would that the end battle was not quite epic as I anticipated or wanted. But then again in hindsight I suppose the battle was more of an internal than external or literal one. It was a war within Caesar. Not only for his soul, but thus his people... Sorry apes ;) Finally, I was surprised by how quiet and altogether intimate and personal the tone of the film was. For a film with 'War' in the title it was not expected. But it was a pleasant and ultimately effective choice because it gave the scenes when all hell broke loose a greater impact.",War for the Planet of the Apes

The quality of the craftsmanship is irrelevant. Well, I am human and so is 100% of the paying audience. I cringed at the narrative and the only reason I didn't walk out is because it was well made, and the lore earned by the far easier to root for original and other lesser movies that followed.So if you walked out and hated the movie then as a fellow human I totally understand. For those who gave it a 10, perhaps either you don't like your own kind very much or think too highly of yourself. This movie is not that deep nor that original.

It is about the psychological evolution of the apes, and how they deal with problems and emotions that we, as humans, know a lot about. Fear, hate, love, hope.The CGI is amazing, and proves that we are on an era where animated characters and actors start to become mixed and melted in our perception.Overall, a great movie.

797,njja02,The best motion capture was wasted on such an average movie.,5,19 July 2017,"* Story/Characters After Koba officially dragged the Apes into war with the humans, Caesar must do whatever he can to protect everyone. But, after tragedy strikes the Apes, Caesar goes on a path of revenge, and learns of secret base where more nefarious things are happening.I wasn't really expecting the story to be so tragic and slow paced. This movie really took time to build up the conflict that was present. It's not a perfect story, not even close, but I found it to be better than the second one's and a bit better than the first one's. Let's start with the good. First off, I found the intro to be pretty fantastic. It built the mood and tone very well, and it was also directed very well. There are also moments that were just haunting and depressing, and it reminded me a lot of some of the WWII movie about the concentration camps. My problems to lie mostly in the plot though. I found the pacing to be fairly slow, which is fine. But, the movie felt a bit repetitive, making that slower pace feel a lot more slower. There were also some dumb moments that didn't make sense, and an exposition scene that felt shoehorned in. Plus the tone was all over the place. Most of the time it was dark, but then there's a scene where the apes are flicking poop at a guard. It just didn't fit the tone at all. I did enjoy the plot over all, but it wasn't amazing.In terms of characters, I enjoyed most of them. I thought Caesar was a fantastic character that I really cared about. He also had some pretty emotional moments that I thought were handled very well. It also helps that Andy Serkis's performance was pretty fantastic. His friends, such as Maurice, were fine. Bad Ape, played by Steve Zahn, was pretty meh. He wasn't very funny, and I felt like he didn't contribute much to the story. Sure, he does save some Apes, but in terms of a character, he doesn't have much to offer. Woody Harrelson played the Colonel, and I thought he was fine I guess. Luckily he isn't in the movie that much, because the movie actually focused on the apes more. I found this to work better, since the human characters in the last two movies fell pretty flat. The rest of the human characters in this movie didn't serve a huge purpose, besides a few that were pretty dumb.* Technicality This is a gorgeous looking movie, with great cinematography. Every frame looked so crisp and clear, I'm surprised how much of an improvement this is from the last one. There are tons of gorgeous shots that just took my breath away. I can say without a doubt that this is the most gorgeous Apes movie. The camera work was also great, giving us some great shots of the CGI work that I'll get into later. Before we get into the biggest achievement this film has, let's talk about the sound design and editing. The sound design was pretty good, and the editing was pretty good. Nothing more, nothing less. Now let's get into the CGI. This is hands down the best motion capture work I've ever seen. Not a single frame with these Apes looked fake. The team behind this needs to win an Oscar. I believed that they were real Apes, I believed that they were there. They just looked plain real, and it's amazing. Even if you didn't like the movie, you have to at least praise the motion capture work.* MusicThe music in this movie is vastly better than the other's. It really fit the tone that the movie was going for. It also accompanied every scene extremely well. To be honest, I don't think that there's a single track I didn't like, which is definitely a good thing.* Action/ScriptThere isn't a whole lot of action actually. Most of the movie is made up of drama. And I thought that the drama was good. But let's talk about the actual action scenes. They were pretty good. I found them to be intense, fun, and pretty exciting. I don't think there was an action scene that I didn't like, I pretty much liked them all. In terms of the script, there are some problems. First off, there are some really dumb characters later in the movie. And there are also things that Apes could have done, but they don't do. But I found the dialogue to be good, and the character motivations made sense. But the humor just didn't work for me, especially in such a dark film like this. Plus the jokes were just not funny. Like I said, some script problems, but not enough to say that the script is bad. * VerdictI do think that War is slightly better than Dawn in terms of plot. But not better in general. It was sad at times, pretty dark, and it had a few great scenes. I'm surprised that people are calling this a masterpiece, all I saw was a pretty mediocre film that had some good moments. 5/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
798,young_hustler_213,Fail,1,6 October 2017,"I am a big fan of all planet of the apes movies and the premises and the idea, i find it original and unique, this one was a disappointment , Caesar personality evolved but not enough, even after the death of his sun, the Koba disorder showed up early, the movie was stretched and the script was simple lacks drama and apes are emotionally distant, the masses of apes increase and decrease from shot to shot, the villain was not original a Negan walking dead kinda guy, cruel on humans and not the guy who is desperately fighting for his home and planet , no motives.... we've been waiting for this war for a long time and it ended very quickly, and the apes did not participate, also we should not be able to pick sides we were supposed to watch a war between two species with two respected convincing generals and leadership, i think it could've been two parts for the war for the planet of the apes. or apes will gather after escaping and with a last heroic leadership of Caesar gathering up the apes to a final battle out of self defense when the rest of the army dressed in white, the one who's survived the snowstorm and their respected convincing loved general are marching up the hills to finish the apes in a last stand for humanity, Caesar dies at the end of the battle , after securing the planet for the apes with a final deed in front of all apes for example blowing something again or killing the general and make the humans surrender or anything to become the legendary ape who's loved and respect by the apes in the classic movies. at the end there were no war, i can go on and on about this failure but simply mother nature and a dictator gave the planet to apes, The Giving of the Planet to the Apes, Starring Humans, Nature.",War for the Planet of the Apes

800,jinyoungg,A Triumphant Trio,9,7 August 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes is my favorite film of the trilogy. It fully showcased the development and aftermath of the protagonist, Caesar. In the movie, we see that he does not want war with the humans, but the safety of the apes. He wants to get as far away from them as possible, but an event occurs that keeps him from reaching that goal.The CGI effects in this movie are remarkable. I must give a huge amount of credit to the special effects team. The list of names on IMDb is huge. They have stepped up the game for the industry. The advancement in technology and the hard work in this department is evident where I couldn't tell that the apes were all CGI. Not to downgrade on the other people that worked on his movie, but the special effects team really stood out to me in this movie (even more than the cinematographer, and I'm a huge fan of beautiful shots).But more than the visual effects, Caesar's internal struggle is the real appeal of this movie. Andy Serkis, once again, is phenomenal. He is the king of motion capture. Serkis said in an interview that he does not want to be remembered ""as the guy who played Gollum."" After this film, he should not to others and he will not to me. Serkis does an amazing job in humanizing this character and making Caesar relatable. We want this character to be triumphant. During the times that he's on the edge, we want him to do better and make the harder decisions, as he's done in the previous films. He must be the best leader for the apes, even though he has to put aside what he wants to do. We see the consequences of his actions portrayed really well in this movie, and how he struggles to make things right. And his companions are a great catalyst to these actions.Once again, Maurice is his good conscience. He's the one that always motivates Caesar to do the right thing. Luca and Rocket are his muscles, and both have great scenes that help Caesar in tough spots; though they are his musclemen, they have their own ways in also lifting up his arms in tough times. There are also two new companions introduced in this movie: Nova and Bad Ape. Bad Ape adds a humor to the film, while Nova, a mute girl, challenges Caesar's mentality towards humans. Here's somewhat of a spoiler:My favorite scene is when Nova is crying while Caesar is in the same shot, but the camera focuses only on Nova. Though Caesar is out of focus, we can still see his movements. By the time of this scene, Caesar has an extremely low point-of-view towards humans, but maybe not all humans are bad. It is an emotional scene, but also a very powerful one. In each film, Caesar has seen good in humans, and Nova is that human in this film. She is my second favorite character in the film and my second favorite scene is also with Nova. The scene is where she helps Caesar when he's at an extremely low point in the film. Finally, there is Woody Harrelson's the Colonel. He is a great antagonist in this film because he pushes Caesar, physically and emotionally, to places where Caesar struggles the most. We saw throughout the three films that Caesar is not someone to mess with. His presence alone puts apes into submission; he simply stands up straight and everyone shrinks below him and reaches out their hands for forgiveness. But the Colonel puts Caesar in the lowest place we've seen him.Overall, I thought this movie was amazing and a great finish to the trilogy. In my opinion, I thought the movies got better with the sequels, and this one stands on top. Director Matt Reeves has my attention; he has done an amazing job with Caesar, and I can't wait what he does with the Dark Knight.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I thought this movie was good because the story made sense, the motion capture work was phenomenal, the acting was amazing, the dialogue had grit to it, and I for one am glad the film didn't have a lot of action because too much of one thing can ruin a movie.I saw one comment the was so insulting and stupid and laughable that it was this guy alone who made me type this review:This movie was terrible. I almost walked out. Talking apes and no good actors. The story sucked. Don't waste your money. The moment the gorilla gave the girl the flower I was like ""is this a romance"" two minutes later the gorilla dies and she cries more for the gorilla then her father who was shot and killed by the apes. This was garbage. I'm angry that sh*tty movies are getting higher rating than genuinely good movies.﻿ - Joe Schmoe (great name by the way (sarcasm, terrible name)1. this comment is so nonsensical that it baffles me. 2. Talking apes and no good actors? the film is called war for the planet of the apes. what did you expect? 3. the actors were great and gave amazing performances. the story sucked? why because it was about family and trust and had heart? what the heck was this person born? the same idiot also posted this:It was laughable and I think the studio knew it. My favorite part was when the apes killed the little girl's father then 10 minutes later the little girl falls in love with an ape who dies just a few minutes afterwards. She cried more for the ape that she knew for about 20 minutes than her father who was gunned down by the apes. She actually walked over her dead fathers body. Hilarious.you know what? **** this guy. first of all the girl was like 8 or 9 years old and the ape was being nice. if you were a little girl and an ape was being nice to you and they died, would you be sad? of course, you would. there's nothing funny about someone dying. someone dying is literally the opposite of funny and the single worse thing that can happen to someone. second, you don't even know if that guy was her father (or he was abusive.) he could have been a kidnapper, a rapist, a serial killer, ANYTHING!!!!I guess that's because most comments and online reviews are from dumb teenagers who think that 2 + 2 = Tokyo. this is one of the reasons why I hate everyone in comment sections.even though those were comments and I found them on the devils advocrits channel on YouTube which is just filled with idiot trolls like Joe who think that their opinions are above everyone else's. Joe even said that if you like this movie, then your stupid. one of the joys of being human is that we all see things differently and all have different tastes and opinions.just to give a quick recap on the previous ape movies in the trilogy, rise was a pretty good movie 7/10, dawn was fantastic and if it weren't for the grand budapest hotel, it would be my number one film of 2014. 9/10. war gets a 7/10",War for the Planet of the Apes

811,fkarpenko,Some of the worst writing I have ever seen,1,22 July 2017,"I was first reluctant to see this film when my friend invited me but after seeing that it has a whopping 8.1 rating and remembering that the previous films were quite enjoyable I was prepared to see a truly good movie. I was incredibly disappointed. **SPOILERS** My first trouble with the film happened with the appearance of the little girl, who seemed to serve absolutely no purpose other than to spontaneously cause tear- jerking moments which were accompanied by sad music in every instance. Throughout the film there must have been around 10 of these, all of them completely pointless and forced. It also baffled me that she had close to 0 reaction to her father dying yet, when a gorilla who she had known for literally one day died, she wept like it was her brother. Another massive problem is that the entire plot of this movie hinges on one condition: that every single person out of the ~1,000 soldiers at the concentration camp is a complete and utter imbecile. Caesar's crew is running around right outside of the walls of the camp? Of course no one notices, why would anyone be on over-watch at a military base? All of the monkeys escape from their cages? Of course there was only one person watching over them. In addition to that, for the duration of what seemed like 10 minutes no one else even noticed that all the monkeys were gone or that the single guard watching over them was killed. Are these real soldiers!? Even statistically, what are the chances that not a single soldier looked at a cage that is in plain view from any part of the camp. These were just the most glaring issues I had with the film. So little thought went into the script. These are incredibly basic problems which could have been fixed with even the slightest effort, This movie was so incredibly dumb that even my friend who doesn't have much interest in film asked me if I wanted to leave before the film was over.",War for the Planet of the Apes

This is honestly the best film I have seen all year. It has incredible characters who you will already adore if you have seen the others, it also has action, and has emotion!! It was not missing anything. It had everything I could have hoped for in the last movie. It also had some funny moments which surprised me. Some of the film had me laughing, whereas other parts had me crying, a range of emotions is exactly what I love when watching a film.The first film had themes of a journey and had emotion, the second film was more dramatic and about themes like action/fighting, but the third film incorporated all of those themes into it!!! It really had everything.

815,sammy-81535,How do people hate this movie?,10,5 January 2018,"This movie was honestly (and personally) the best movie of 2017. It was well paced and quite emotional. I do understand the lack of originality of the film, and i can agree with that but I cannot understand how hated this movie is.War is such a great end to the reboot PoTA trilogy and the CGI is tremendously realistic and everything about this movie is great, including the occasional humor and amazing storytelling. The characters are unique, especially the Colonel (the main antagonist) and I get that there really isn't a war in the film despite the title, but that shouldn't be a reason to hate the actual movie. In fact, if you want to hate on the fact that the title is misleading, then why wasn't there much of a problem with Rise being earlier than the events of Dawn (I actually watched Dawn first thinking that the movie was first released) ?I just don't get the criticism and the negativity this movie received since this movie is easily the best film of the franchise.
Sincerely, a PoTA fan",War for the Planet of the Apes
816,BreyWagram,Fell asleep,1,9 August 2017,"This movie is so boring that after a few minutes, I had to take a small nap. When I woke up, I still understood what was going on, meaning nothing. The whole plot of that thing is, they go somewhere, and they come back, and meanwhile there are a couple of special effects. As too often unfortunately, the millions went to special effects, not to the underfed writers, who got lost in nothingness and all along, wrote about their despair of having nothing to tell. As usual, the apes end up displaying a bit more humanity than the humans themselves, but we got used to that through previous episodes. Finally, the badly paid and uninspired writers find themselves in a dead end, and sort of, they terminate their movie in a cataclysmic way, because only the hand of God could end their chain of poor choices. This empty movie deserves empty theaters. Call the supervisor ! I want my money back !",War for the Planet of the Apes

I would actually rate it 9/10, but I felt the need to make up for the poor reviews that others gave this film. All of the 1/10 ratings are aimed at the concept of apes running humans (which is the whole freaking point of the book and series) and not actually at the quality of the movie. Please read the ratings that are above a 6/10 for more details. It was riveting, tear-jerking, and inspiring from a moral standpoint.The series has never been about action movie-esque fighting scenes, and more about the concept that turns your world on its head. This hatred is the epitome of revisionism (the kind of people that want to erase American atrocities against the indigenous people from history books). I would explain it as a cult of people that have a blinding devotion to the greatness of humans, like we have never done anything wrong before.Good thing we don't live in North Korea; think for yourself. Don't be superficial and let this movie teach you the lessons its crew worked so hard to portray.",War for the Planet of the Apes
821,mikejensen-45813,This movie is good and oh my god it is sooo emotional! But come on Matt Reeves,7,27 July 2017,"Why the rush and stupid decisionmaking? If you haven't seen the movie yet don't read further. SPOILER ALERT!One particular thing which irritated me ""a lot"" was how the controversity between human and apes was told and how the story went on. Through the movie you get a clear view that apes tell themselves that they are apes and not human pets and humans sees the apes as the reason why humans are closely getting exterminated. In this movie, there is a lot of talk from Caesar and I find that to be a problem. I think they overuse the excitement when Caesar. Looking back at the first movie Rise of the planet of the apes my favorite scene is when Caesar trying to escape from the zoo and getting into a fight with Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) and screams NO!. Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps. How I would have instructed the movie, I would only have caesar to speak when humans was involved and not around the apes. The emotions are so strong in the first act when Caesar's family is together and you see the love and happiness told through physical and facial expression.Now comes the b*llshit stuff. Where should I start? 1. A gorilla on a horse. This is one of the more random and funny b*llshit scenes happening in this movie. I just find it odd a gorilla around 200 kg. can ride a horse for so long. This gorilla which follows Caesar is BIG! I know horses can weight around 500-600 kg or more but in this movie the gorilla looks bigger than the horse!2. Stupid guards: Random girl entering a ""high secure"" military base. When Maurice, Bad ape and Nova trying to make a plan to save Caesar and the rest of the monkeys, Nova just decide to walk in to caesar giving him her doll, water and food. How the heell...? Does she have some kind of an invisible cape? Before this scene we see a scene at morning where all the soldiers stand outside and there is plenty!3. Stupid guards part 2: One angry big balled soldier. The rescue the apes plan is starting. A lookout guard gets hit by monkey poop and gets mad. So mad he apparently walks down to the gate of the fence. Opens the fence, where there is 80-100 apes ready to have a dance with a human punchingbag, and then locks himself with the apes to find the guilty ape. What the....4. Stupid guards part 3: Ninjamonkeys The guards get pulled down the hole, luckily without triggering his finger from the weapon which could give a signal to the other guards that he is in trouble but no. They now got a weapon and it goes as planned. Now rescue the baby monkeys. The monkeys climb with a cable above the guards like they are the pink panther.5. Stupid guards part 4: Directors cut. It's now morning the apes are escaping but oh no! The enemy's soldiers has arrived with big guns and air support. The soldiers runs to the wall and one stops and looks to the fence were the apes was captured and gives a look which tells ""Oh No! The monkey's has escaped!"".6. Stupid guards part 5: Remake. The guards are now shooting at the human enemy's air support and now they see the apes escaping. They then makes a decision which could be said like this: "" I don't know how long we can keep defending our base! Look! Defenseless monkeys, let's kill them instead!"". And then the scene switches and you see Caesar escaping from the colonel's office. The soldiers start shooting at him. He sees a grenade belt and a big tank of oil and thinks ""Michael Bay explosion? heell yeah!"". Right before he throws the grenade he gets shot by an arrow from the guy he spared his life and are going to kill him while he lays down. Red Donkey regrets turning to the dark side and sees Caesar laying on the ground defenseless. He takes a grenade launcher an shoots the soldier who are like 6-7 feet away from Caesar who doesn't even get's a scratch (Didn't happen to me when I played MW2, just saying). The soldier who got assisted by Red Donkey then sees it and takes his gun and blows the brain out of Red Donkey and then turning full stormtrooper mode and miss an entire mag on Caesar who keeps rolling and does what we all had been waiting for. EXPLOSION! AWWW YEAH!7. Caesar > Natural disaster The military base turns into new year's eve. The enemy's soldier celebrates but they did it too quick. A avalanche starts and everyone is screwed. The soldiers are getting wiped out instantly. Caesar tries to parkour his way out jumping from tree to tree until he realises that he can't jump around no more and stays at a tree which trunk is the size of my thigh (No... I'm not fat). He survives like the odds was 50/50 and the monkeys are the only survivors now. Happy ending.",War for the Planet of the Apes

It betrays all the good character building in the previous two apes movies by transforming caesar and everyone around him into flat one dimensional unrealistic cardboard cutouts.
The movie is fake-deep and it is infuriating that it can fool this many people.
But the biggest problem is that at every oppurtunity this movie gets, it tries so hard to make it emotional. EVERY SINGLE TIME.
Everything is done at the emotional extreme. And the garbage ending is the biggest example of this.In a couple of years we will look back at this movie and enjoy it because it is so bad it is good.",War for the Planet of the Apes

827,mintcar-70108,The plot of a mindless 80s B-movie,2,11 November 2017,"This movie reminds me of really bad fantasy B-movies from the 80s and 90s – you know when the mere fact that the movie had fantastical elements made you watch it no matter how bad it was? Those movies had paper thin plots with a lot of moronic plot holes, badly written dialog and almost no action because that was expensive to shoot. They had some limited special effects, were shot in the wilderness with a limited cast and one or two scenes with a lot of extras that they splashed most of their cash on. Everything about this movie is like that except off course it's not cheap and the effects are superb. Odd that it turned out this way since the other two movies in the series are legitimately good. I could have enjoyed this for what it was it if had any business being this bad, but it really hasn't.

828,foxxjaw,Just Excellent.,10,22 July 2017,"War for the Planet of the Apes— from the sounds of the title this is an action movie about the war between apes and humans right? Not exactly. If anything it is more dramatic with some action scenes throughout. If you are looking for a hardcore action film, this may not be the place to look. While there are some action scenes throughout, the main focus of this film is the characters and their emotions. The apes look absolutely incredible in this film— this film has some of the best CGI in any film ever. The performances are, without exception, excellent. This movie feels very well written and the plot is deep; this is a movie that will make you use your brain throughout the movie. Overall I very much enjoyed this movie and feel that it was a very well-written, and well-acted movie. The action can be intense even though there isn't too much of it; its predecessors certainly focused more on the action but War focused on the characters motives and intentions. There really was no characters in this film that I disliked, all the main characters were well written and well developed so that we really get to know the personalities of the apes even with their minimal use of verbal language. This movie is certainly not for everybody (hence the many negative reviews) but for many of us, this film is a very enjoyable drama-action movie that is absolutely worth seeing for its excellent effects, acting, and writing.",War for the Planet of the Apes

During this movie you will see human soldiers being beaten to death with zero emotion, yet there is an endless number of 'touching' scenes when a key ape character dies. This film is non-stop with such scenes which, in tandem with over the top music, finally end with an anti-climax leaving you wonder if they will ever just get on with the movie.Queue the 'comedy' element of 'Bad Ape', a ridiculous mashup of Gollem and Jar Jar Binks. What were they thinking when they made this?? Just stupid.The Colonel, an evil man hell bent on breaking the will of Caesar, just suddenly becomes ill despite never showing any signs of illness beforehand. His death scene was the epitome of the many anti-climatic scenes throughout this film.The colonels mute sidekick with the crossbow never spoke or had any sort of character development, yet is ultimately the guy who kills Caesar weirdly enough.I'm sure I've seen this movie before, the story was predictable and could be the plot for many a film.

If you want to unintentionally fall asleep during a movie then is a must watch!Firstly, I have no clue how this movie has a whooping 8/10 star rating...I guess people feel sorry for mute people & monkeys?The movie just didn't make sense; they turned the clock backwards on evolution where humans were getting infected and gradually turned into apes. Why does only the main character (Caesar) speak while the rest of his clan communicate using sign language and they can magically understand each other perfectly fine?I guess the directors tried to add realistic elements but miserably failed. During one scene, the little girl wept uncontrollably over the gorilla's death who gave her a flower and she didn't even acknowledge her father's death earlier; who was supposedly trying to protect her (unless the deceased was a pedophile keeping her in a basement and she wanted to escape with the apes which doesn't make f***ing sense).This movie provided no intellectual stimulation and honestly I could of been more entertained watching monkeys eat bananas.",War for the Planet of the Apes

From Rise to War For the Planet of the Apes, you can see how the apes have changed and differ from each other also that is why this is an emotion driven movie as this is a war. The movie is driven from Caesar's point of view where you will get to know that he only wants his apes safe, this drives the movie. Matt Reeves has delivered an amazing conclusion,as we can see where his effort went while making the movie because the movie is nearly perfectly directed , this has people excited as his next project which is directing The Batman starring Ben Afleck.

The visuals and cinematography were incredible, no doubting that. What angered me is the story-line and in particular the false title, ""War for the Planet of the Apes"". This movie does nothing to deserve the title and feels like the writers could not think of a story-line that had the apes winning while also remaining the heroes (i.e. without killing all humans).The so-called war involves a brief skirmish in the woods between apes and humans, followed by two hours of build up to a 10 minute battle between humans and humans. Whenever the movie gave us a hint of the battle, with admittedly epic scenes which reminded me of a modern take on the opening of Gladiator, the director cut away to Caesar skulking around, Woody Harrelson doing his best zombie impression, or the apes hiding behind rocks. And this ""battle"" is ended by a single grenade destroying one human army, and a ridiculous avalanche destroying the other. Yes I accept that the avalanche may represent Mother Nature destroying the humans, but why in gods name was the story-line not about apes fighting a war against humans?This is my main issue with the movie, and I won't even go into the farcically drawn out season of Prison Break lumped into the movie for no apparent reason.

I really liked the first two movies in this trilogy, but this movie was so bad. The story is so cliché and has been told 100 times over. The directing was horrible and most of the music and dialog was so cheesy. They even threw in a Jar Jar Binks character for some cringe worthy comic relief. There was no reason given for the plot and there was no reason to care about Caesar or the apes. Having to listen to a bunch of apes squawk like 2 year old children while reading subtitles the entire movie was just the needle that finally broke this camels back.

Matt Reeves has cemented himself among the greats with this masterpiece. Andy Serkis shines yet again as Caesar and Woody Harrelson gives a breathtaking performance as military leader, 'the colonel'. The complexity of the characters and their motives is astonishingly well done. While it may seem clear who to root for this is thrown into question more than once, this is cinematic storytelling at its finest! The title may not be entirely indicative of its content as not much war takes place although it may be referring to an internal struggle. Thanks to Oscar worthy performances all round, you feel every emotion as the main characters feel them with a plot that is stunningly deep and free of cheap twists!

843,dushantreddy,Everything but bit milder ceasar,9,16 July 2017,"The plot was just awesome. It is a step by step transition of humans to wild and Apes to a superior species. There is definitely unrest between now smart apes and humans, but the twist I like is how the humans are getting effected and turning. Having said that..In all fairness the characterization is what given this movie so much following. There are almost three generations of planet of apes, why would I still crave for the series..? its because of Ceasar. For me hands down I liked Dawn of planet of apes better, Only because of ceasar. Ceasar commanded the dawn. The way he uses his tone.. ""Apes"" that was resounding. Somehow I missed that ceasar here. I was also expecting an Ape on Ape battle. Ceasar was building anger within, every scene, I thought there would be an explosion of ceasar. He definitely reacted mature and more older version of him. Though my thirst for ceasar aggression was not quenched I still liked the movie. His dominance did continue in very different way. Thank you Matt reeves and crew.",War for the Planet of the Apes
844,niovino-04920,Pretty solid,7,17 July 2017,"Going into this movie, I was pretty excited. Watching the others before this one to get them straight, I had my mind set on expectations. After seeing this one, I realized that there really isn't even a need to see the others to get prepared for this one. This goes for the other films as well. Every one of these movies depicts the background and how we go to this position in the first place in every film, and this movie does just that yet again, like the last movie did. This film in particular though, was pretty admirable. There is plenty of action between the human race and the apes, as well as humans and humans (you'll see when you go see it. The suspense and the story line made this film very believable, and it almost contrasted an epidemic in such a way that something like this could be very possible. With the background as Caesar attempting to lead the ape army to their own land, the obstacle that stands in the way are the humans. In the past two films, when apes and humans were against each other full force, you wanted the humans to win the movie. Oddly enough, the way the humans in this film are depicted in this film - cruel, selfish, and brutal, you almost want the apes to win, which I think is extremely unique, as it is a contradicting concept. In this movie, you really come to love and admire Caesar and his kind, and in a sense, you almost feel no sympathy for the humans on how heartless they were towards the apes. I absolutely loved this concept, as it is just puts completely different spin on things that a lot of movies now fail to do. All in all, after being a fan of the first two films, this one didn't disappoint either. You don't even need to see any of the others to enjoy this one. It all ties it back to the start in some way. For anyone who wants to venture out or is a fan of the first two movies, I absolutely recommend going to see this one.",War for the Planet of the Apes
845,toini-01373,Underwhelming to say the least,1,17 July 2017,"This movie had everything going for it. 1 good and 1 amazing movie in the franchise, fantastic CGI and great cinematography.It opens up with a skirmish in the forest and you can just marvel at the action scene which is extremely beautifully filmed in long and steady shots. What a change!After how Dawn managed to make you empathize as much for the humans as for the apes (Gary Oldman and Andy Serkis carried it...), it lead to an epic confrontation where the apes assaulted the human city. THIS is what I expected from War, but in bigger.I wanted to see how the apes, particularly Ceasar, would be forced to abandon their pacific policies and put an end to humanity. How humans and apes would face-off in one big final clash. How we would root for both humans and apes making the film an emotional roller coaster, etc.SPOILER: All we got in the end was an anti-army, anti-Christian, anti-US film that thought so highly of itself that it lingered on for ages on random stupid scenes. Gorilla gives flower to girl, Gorilla dies in the next scene. Colonel picks up doll, colonel cannot speak in the next scene. Avalanche finishes off humanity (wait what...?). I just believe that after the success of the 2nd installment praised for both its CGI but also its very compelling and emotional scenes (when Gary Oldman turns on his ipad...), the director suddenly considered himself a genius and thought he could do no wrong. He was wrong. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was simply a high class popcorn action movie, but a popcorn action movie non the less - War for the Planet of the Apes forgot about that. A bit like The Hunger Games, after the second amazing installment combined social message with action, the director thought people went to the cinema for the social message...Extremely disappointed, do not watch it...",War for the Planet of the Apes

I was not expecting perfection of course, but an average, solid movie, at least as good as the last 2 in the series. I liked last 2 movies, they were not perfect, but good enough for me.After wasting 2 hours of my life on this movie disaster, I had to write my first review ever, because never has a movie disappointed me this much. The marketing material (trailers, posters, music) is a complete lie! If you expect anything resembling THE ultimate fight for survival, you are watching the wrong movie. If you expect anything similar to epic ""NO!"" or ""GO!"" moments from previous movies, good luck with that! There is nothing EPIC, war-like in this movie at all. 5 people left the cinema in the middle of the screening, and I almost did the same. During some ""epic"" scenes, I almost started laughing how bad it was. Couldn't wait for it to end. Felt I deserved refund.Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money on this.

The visual effects on the apes looks stunning that it look so real!,War for the Planet of the Apes
849,gragas-19562,Quite bad compared to the first two,2,19 July 2017,"The only good part I can think of about this movie was the CGI and the ape effects, which were amazingly life like. The rest of it was dull, boring, or made no sense.I must say though, the first couple of minutes, with the opening fight scene and then the part when Ceasar's son comes back and tells everyone about the promised land - at that point the film showed promise. Afterwords though it all falls through when woody shows up and murders Ceasars family which compels him to leave his tribe to head to the promised land themselves while he and his ""ape-squad"" go off on their own to kill woody.The story is quite incoherent. But the main thing about the movie that makes me dislike War while loving Dawn is perspectives. In dawn, the humans are well, humanized as are the apes. And the movie shows that the intelligent apes are no better than the humans with Koba's backdoor scheming. Kind of like the feeling you get when watching documentaries about chimpanzee wars.In war, however, that doesn't happen, in fact it feels like the movie goes out of its way to do an Apes: good Humans: bad thing. Even though by the end I was rooting for Woody who actually had a motive to save his species' vocal cords despite his superiors' wishes. But in general the movie shows humans as bad guys, such as making the little girl not shed a tear for her dead father, but for the dead ape, then saves the life of her father's killer. Then quickly starts thinking herself as an ape. And the rest of the humans (Other than Woody) get absolutely no depth and are just *bad guys*. I was hoping that the crossbow guy from the beginning would be this movie's Malcolm, but no, he got no development after the first scene. I also noticed that they didn't even give the *official* US army guys any faces, just masks, again making the humans faceless and evil.And i hope the added in subplot with the mutant disease that makes you mute ends, because from how the movie ended, all sources for the disease spreading were either completely incinerated (Woody&doll) or chilling with the apes (Nova) therefore cant spread it. And its not like it was a universal mutation, because that not how diseases/evolution works.Finally, also wanted to mention that there was hardly a ""war"" in the first place and that ""dawn"" would've been more deserving of the title. And I'm not even going to talk about the wereid prison break part. Then the bizarre ending when all of woody's men were killed leaving the other human army in full awareness of the apes and the writers couldn't think of a way for the apes to beat these guys so an avalanche shows up and kills them all.",War for the Planet of the Apes

Completely convoluted and nearly nonsensical plot, wrapped in a farcical attempt to be profound, while being utterly transparent in its attempt to copy some iconic movies and characters (Ape-ocalypse, really?!). This total monkey poo is actually what will wipe out our species by making us all stupider with every passing minute we watch it.

851,robertbluenm,Little to no actual war in this movie,3,19 July 2017,"Based on how the second installment in this series ended, I entered the theater with the assumption that this movie would be about the escalating struggle (war) between the apes and humans. This simply is not the case.While the movie starts out with some actual fighting between Caesar's apes and some mysterious special forces Colonel, the rest of the movie is quite boring, involving Caesar's quest for revenge on the Colonel (by the way, the subplot makes this all meaningless as the last 15 minutes of the movie reveal).The only real warlike fight in the entire movie is 10 minutes before the end, and it is humans fighting humans, with some incidental ape involvement because they happen to be escaping from the area at the same time.The main subplot having to do with a progression of the Simian Flu basically means that all humans will eventually regress to pre- speech levels of intelligence. As a result, this entire movie, and everything that the apes do in it was utterly pointless. The humans fight each other, and the surviving soldiers are wiped out by an avalanche, and all remaining humans will eventually become stupid and thus irrelevant to this ""War"". The problem takes care of itself, and would have gone the same way with or without the apes' involvement. The apes all go hide in the middle of nowhere after not fighting a war at any point during the movie.I was very disappointed with this horribly irrelevant fixture in an otherwise quite enjoyable series.",War for the Planet of the Apes
852,aossowska,Mediocre,4,20 July 2017,"I went to see the movie based on general IMDb score and now I wonder who writes them. The movie was disappointing (based on the score given). There was no story I could relate to and it was just not interesting enough for me. I really liked the first movie but the other two are just not my cup of tea. I sat in the cinema watching it and thinking how it reminds me if Britain's Got Talent and 101 Dalmatians. Why? in BGT there was an average dance group dressed line Star Wars troops – they got far in the show just because they dressed up. How this related to this movie? The apes had all human characteristics hence I felt like they are just humans dressed up as apes – without the ape costume it would be just an average war movie. And the whole escape of young apes is like watching 101 Dalmatians, if you watched this movie you will hopefully know what I am talking about. I know they are completely random thoughts but if you are going to this movie try remembering what did you think about watching it. I almost forgotten about the 'funny ape' – nice touch but it felt out of place and really random. It works in MARVEL movies but not necessarily in this serious War for the Planet of the Apes movie.",War for the Planet of the Apes
853,jacksonjmachesky,Fitting End to the Trilogy,8,20 July 2017,"WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (2017), directed by Matt Reeves, is the conclusion of the story of Caesar (Andy Serkis) in his journey to find peace for his family and for the rest of the apes from 15 years of struggle with humankind. ""War"" doesn't disappoint with its fantastic visuals, great performances, interesting story, and plenty of heart-wrenching moments. Despite of some questionable performances and plot-related conveniences, ""War"" remains a fitting end to a compelling trilogy that will stick with me for some time.Let me preface this review by saying that the title of this movie does not do it justice. Many individuals were disappointed about the fact that they went into the theater expecting all-out war between apes and humans, and instead got a relatively slowly- paced film that served as a compliment to its two predecessors. Before seeing this film, I revisited the trilogy and that strengthened my overall experience. If you did not like ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" (2014), then I do not think you will enjoy this film.First off, from a technical aspect, the visual effects in ""War"" are beyond impressive, especially in regards to the principal apes in the movie. Most impressive is the orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval), especially in close-up shots; he's almost photo- realistic. Director of Photography Michael Seresin doesn't disappoint with the cinematography of ""War,"" which compliments the already spectacular visuals. The score, provided by Michael Giacchino, is also well-done and interestingly used, though some of the choices of instruments towards the end of the film were questionable and a bit cheesy. From a visual standpoint, this film is spectacular!The acting in this movie was excellent! Andy Serkis' portrayal as Caesar has continuously improved since ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011), and the subtleties of Serkis' performance in ""War"" makes this his best performance yet! Most of the other apes, especially Maurice (Karin Konoval), Rocket (Terry Notary), and Red/Donkey (Ty Olsson) were portrayed extremely well. Especially noteworthy were Toby Kebbell's brief appearances as Koba, which were not only well-acted but hauntingly realistic. Woody Harrelson's performance was decent, as Harrelson did a good job playing the war-hardened Colonel. However, Steve Zahn's performance as Bad Ape took a while to get used to, and provided some comic relief to a movie that I don't think needed it to succeed. Nova (Amiah Miller) was also mediocre, and I did not completely buy her performance.The story of ""War"" really serves to bring the character of Caesar full. All Caesar really wants to do is protect the people that he loves, and he is willing to go to extreme lengths to protect them. This has been the case since the beginning of the trilogy. That makes the murder of Cornelia (Judy Greer) and Blue Eyes (Max Lloyd-Jones) so impactful. Its bluntness and brutality really speaks to how the directors have connected me emotionally to these characters. Caesar's failure in protecting his family acts as the film's inciting moment. The ""war"" that is referred to in the title has two fronts: the actual war between apes and humans and Caesar's internal war in either giving in to primal instincts to enact revenge on The Colonel or refraining from doing so.The end of the movie brings the story full-circle: ""Rise"" begins with Caesar's birth and ""War"" ends with Caesar's death. While its extremely convenient that Caesar only succumbs to his injuries at the exact moment the apes have found their new home, Caesar's death is poignant and heartbreaking, especially having gotten to know the character since I first saw ""Rise"" in 2011, and Serkis' and Konoval's performances capture that moment beautifully.I did have multiple problems with the movie however. First off, you do have to see the first two movies if you want to truly experience this film. Yes, there is information given to us via text at the beginning of the movie (which annoyed me a bit), but to truly understand this movie the other films are essential. I found Luca's (Michael Adamthwaite) death to be a bit emotionally manipulative. It was underwhelming and it bothered me a little because of its non-necessity. The burning of a US flag was unnecessary and manipulatively symbolic, and did not really contribute to the story at hand. Furthermore, the avalanche ex-machina was also extremely convenient in wiping out what was left of the human army, and the fact that all of the apes found a tree to climb up during that scene was extremely unbelievable, especially because many apes, including Bad Ape, are nowhere close to a tree when the avalanche supposedly hits.Despite those problems, I find that the depiction of humans in this movie does not bother me as much as many other reviewers. Yes, humans are portrayed as the ""enemy,"" but I don't think the message of ""War"" is that ""humans are bad."" I believe that the message of the film revolves around how fear of the unknown can corrupt the human mind. This theme has been explored before in ""Dawn"" with Gary Oldman's Dreyfus; again, the other two films are necessary to see how fear has progressively changed humanity in the face of complete destruction.Overall, ""War of the Planet of the Apes"" left me with a bittersweet taste in my mouth - in a good way. The ups of this movie outweigh the downs, and I would recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys the trilogy as much as I do. While this movie is not for everybody, it is definitely worth buying a ticket on the biggest screen you can find, and I will be re-watching the entire trilogy when ""War"" is available for purchase.Apes. Together. Strong.8/10",War for the Planet of the Apes
854,mowgley,Drawn out movie with lack of action.,5,21 July 2017,"Found myself actually nodding off at one point. Ending was good but the movie was very slow and drawn out. This can't even compare to the first planet of the apes in this series. The second one was okay but this one was the worst out of all three. Cesar is too compassionate as always. You think he would have learned his lesson by now not to trust a human. It was interesting though how biblical themes were installed within the movie, not that all viewers would have known but from the scourging of Cesar in a Christ like scene to the finding of their promised land. To embody Cesar as a Christ and Moses like figure was interesting.",War for the Planet of the Apes
855,shraja,Could have been better,5,22 July 2017,"Before I start, I wanted to mention that I've seen both ""Rise"" and ""Dawn"", and loved them. For those two movies, I went in there just wanting to be entertained, and ended up being really impressed. So when I went to see ""War"", I had higher expectations (nothing too ridiculous). Overall, the movie wasn't as awful as some are making it out to be, but it definitely could have been much better. Here's a few things that stood out to me:(**may contain spoilers**)1. TOOK TOO LONG FOR THE ACTION. The first half of the movie, other than maybe the first 15 minutes, was really boring. Little to no action, not much character depth (other than Caesar), and I kept waiting for the plot to pick up. And I can't really say the second half is any better. While the story progressed, only the last twenty minutes or so had some good action.2. CHEESY PLOT. Alright maybe not thaaat cheesy. I was surprised when the writers killed of Caesar's wife and son so early in the movie, but I'm sad to say, that's the one and only part I was really into watching. I understood that he would want to avenge his family's death, but I didn't think that would basically be the entire story. The apes trying to relocate somewhere else ended up as a side story in Caesar's mission to kill the bad guy. All I can say is, at least we didn't get some chummy monkey romance to go with it. 3. MOVIE TOOK ITSELF WAY TOO SERIOUSLY. Yeah, I rolled my eyes when the gang arrived at site, to find their friends and families imprisoned in some sort of concentration camp. The first two movies in the trilogy correctly identified themselves as sci-fi, and they had fun with it without getting too crazy. This one was a little too preachy for my tastes, and overall felt like I was watching a heavy drama (although some dramas have more complex story lines than this)4. USELESS CHARACTERS. (a) Characters I didn't care about: Mute girl, Red/Donkey, that one guy Caesar pardoned, Lake, Luka, Winter, the colonel (b) Characters I kind of liked: Bad Ape, Caesar's sons, Koba (c) Characters the story focused on: see (a)5. MISSED OPPORTUNITIES. They had a lot of missed opportunities with this movies. One that stands out to me is the colonel-- Woody Harrelson, who ended up being a comic book level villain, evil for the sake of being evil. I wasn't expecting a huge sob story background that turned him bad, but I expected more than ""I killed my own son so I'll kill you too"". Another thing I wanted was too see how this epidemic affected the rest of the world. This was just my own wishful thinking, but it could've been cool too see the apes vs. humans conflict in Asia or something, idk. At the very least, it shouldn't have been centered on one villain (and his goons). This wasn't a war, it was just one tiny battle with not much a conclusion.Once again, the movie wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen, but it really could have been so much more. The acting was wonderful, and the CGI and settings were gorgeous. But if I could go back in time, I'd wait till this came to redbox before watching.",War for the Planet of the Apes

However, as soon as the credits started to roll, my husband announced, ""Thank God it's over. That was the worst movie I've ever seen!"" All of us agreed. I am so sorry to have wasted that money, but I'm even sorrier about wasting the time that I could have spent doing something else -- ANYTHING ELSE -- with my family. The kicker was when my 11-year-old son sadly concluded that he no longer likes movies. Likewise, my 20-year-old son did not have a kind word to say about it.

858,gregymead,An Opportunity Missed,4,24 July 2017,"This could have been the opportunity for the producers to make sense of the PotA reboot. If you recall, in the original Chalrton Heston film, the final scene shows him on horseback, riding along a coastline, only to be hit by the realisation that he is not on a different planet as we'd been lead to believe, but is in fact on Earth, in a different time and that the human race had obliterated itself by Nuclear War. Skip to Wot PotA, a rogue assemblance of humans lead by Woody Harrelson is attacked at a former military base by an army of humans intent on rectifying Harrleson's wrongs, with the Apes caught in the middle of the conflict. Instead of the natural outcome which would have circled the story, the Director takes us on a journey of animal empathy, where the Apes display more human quality than Harrleson's rogue band. The point is laboured from the outset and fails to pick up pace until the final 5 minutes climatic scene. Only a sprinkling of comedic humour breaks the monotomy of the ""2 legs bad"" narative. Why didn't the producers end with the obvious? I can only suggest that another instalment of man vrs ape is lined up for production.",War for the Planet of the Apes

This movie was boring at best and I can understand how people see it as preaching and politically correct. I agree with another reviewer that said you can watch the first 10 minutes and last 15 minutes without missing anything crucial,War for the Planet of the Apes
865,ecwmlnj,Terrible movie,1,29 July 2017,"This is one sorry movie. First time I've ever walked out of a movie half way through. Slow, sluggish, left wing crap. This movie could have been done in an hour, not 2.5 hours. It was the most painful hour and 15 minutes I ever spent at a movie before I had to either leave or kill myself. How anyone can say this is cinematic excellence is beyond me. The story made zero sense. Dark, dumb, waste of time and money.",War for the Planet of the Apes

There were enough action scenes for me to not get bored but the best thing about this movie was the meaningful message about war. I was able to sympathize with most of the characters and enjoyed watching the movie immensely. Maybe it's because I cry easily or I empathized with the characters but I cried for a good hour of the movie (and bothered the lady to my right) but I would recommend it and not because of the action but because it taught a good lesson which is worth watching.",War for the Planet of the Apes
867,coco-67035,Epic!!,10,30 July 2017,You know you've watched a great film when you feel the need to sign up to IMDb to write a review. I didn't think they could top the last films in the series. The effects are just out of this world. The script was fantastic and the emotional aspect kept you on the edge of your seat throughout. What an epic film!! A must-see!!,War for the Planet of the Apes
868,quanyijun,Wasted 2 hrs in the cinema while i have better things to do,1,30 July 2017,"Basically, don't waste your time watching this film. I don't know why the rating on IMDb and rotten tomato for this film is so high. As a researcher in computer vision and graphics, I can appreciate how good the cgi is but still the film maker is wasting their money and resource to make a film which tells a rubbish story which didn't develop naturally. Lots of things in the film are just against common sense and fells the film maker is trying to make fun of the viewer. Such a bad movie, I don't want to waste even one more second for it!",War for the Planet of the Apes

872,arthyedelman,Great ending to a great trilogy,9,7 August 2017,"""War for the Planet of the Apes"" is the darkest chapter of the trilogy. Forget about the friendship between Ceasar and humans, this time, it is about vengeance and pride. A war between humans and apes for the planet earth. The film is beautifully crafted and Matt Reeves allow the audience to really see the film form the perspective of Ceasar. It is just a beautiful piece on its on and the performances of both Andy Serkis and Woody Harrelson add to this masterpiece.",War for the Planet of the Apes
873,caterpillar-17741,Seriously intense film!,10,8 August 2017,"This film was Incredible, I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews! It was gripping from the get go. And no there may not have been a war throughout the entire film but it was obviously building up to something! I was on the edge of my seat the entire 2.5 hours! I've never hated Woody Harrison so much, he played his character amazingly! And the CGI is just so impressive I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't real! Will be going back to watch it again it was so good! I'd go as far as saying it was the best film I've ever seen!",War for the Planet of the Apes

875,andresfw,Great movie for finishing the trilogy,8,21 August 2017,"""it contains spoilers""This movie is the third one of the story of the planet of apes. This movie is called war for the planet of the apes, I think that is a great movie with an excellent story, it contains a great film with the movie effects and the actors that they have are really good. Maybe one thing that I didn't like was that the name is not really good for the movie, because during the movie we can see a lot of parts that are with action, but the movie has a lot of more of drama, because we can see how Cesar is affronting his demons and his problems fighting with them during all the movie, fighting for his species and for his family. I thought that during this movie I will saw a lot of action a lot of war a big war but doesn't. the factor that gives a lot of point to the movie is the images the effect that it haves the technology they used making the apes, the photography and the visual part was perfect making a really good and interesting movie. The other factor that gives points to the movie was that the plot of the movie that shows us that the apes were the good ones of the movie the ones that love that truly have a family and that they take care of theme selves, making the objective of the one that watches the movie that loves the apes and not the human, and this was the think that the director wants with the movie. A short summary of the movie is that Cesar has his family his town of apes and he was the leader, but the leader of the humans of the human came to his town of apes and killed his family, so he returns to kill the humans and the bad gay the leader of the humans for vengeance of his family and his species. I think that their ethical aspects the way they treat the human girl shows that the culture of the apes is that they are lovely and that they go warder than the vengeance, because they allow this girl enter to their family, but that doesn't generalize the human race all as bad people. finally, I think that the apes show a better culture and better moral and ethical actions than the humans in the movie and is a great movie that goes beyond the tittle.also this was a very good movie for finishing the trilogy they finish in an excellent way, they let us now that the story of the 3 movies is finish, and they didn't let us like other movies with a bad end.",War for the Planet of the Apes

It started well for few minutes but suddenly became too slow that i couldn,t bare and had to leave the theater at not even half of the movie.I was feeling too sleepy. Instead of war there were only talks and talks and that too with stupid broken language. I really liked the first one but i didn,t like anything in this movie beside good sleep. So thanks a lot.",War for the Planet of the Apes
877,skepticalnihilist,Stop pretending like it's Godsend,1,3 September 2017,"The first two movies begin with the slow pacing that were eventually to led to this finale. Turns out, it's the worst in the series, continuing the pattern of being 'the third and the turd' of the trilogy movie franchises. The movie and its fans pretend like it's something not of war, but of a greater story based adventure, which it definitely is not. The first and second movie, more importantly, second movie's ending, led us to believe that this movie will have the ultimate promised war that was looming since the ending of the first movie. This movie does far less than deliver the promise. It's not called being shallow to expect war from a movie like this, instead we got is slow paced movie with terribly clichéd ending.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I totally agree with that.This movie is much better than the previous 2. In fact, this movie should be used as ""foot"" to develop true sequels of the same quality as this, and even better.Rarely nowadays you can see a movie that is entertaining from the beginning to the end and with all the condiments you could imagine of a great movie. This movie reaches all those levels. And if you do not like it, I honestly could not understand why.It is moving, has action, has good CGI, good rhythm ... and all that works cohesively to fit in to a very good argument.What more can I say.Only those who can truly appreciate this film, forgetting their prequels, only appreciating this ... will understand.10/10",War for the Planet of the Apes

If you weren't already done with Hollywood before watching this progressive diarrhea, prepare to be pushed over the edge. You have been warned, many times over by all of the other comments I have read here. This film is boring, poorly written and does the previous 2 films a grave injustice. SJWs have officially taken over all forms of entertainment. The real war is already here, but not so sure it has anything to do with apes... More so with the social engineering of our society through media. Just another tidbit - all positive reviews are clearly fake/paid for.

884,danycute,Awesome,10,30 October 2017,"This movie is good. It shows how much greedy and animals humans are. The apes were human and not just like us but fully human. Caeser only cared for his pride, and family. For us it shows how much we don't care if we make others suffers and the greed to rule is madness. I like bad ape he made the movie not about action he showed we can laugh in tough situations because if you are always serious you'll never think positive. Marcie shows the kindness and caring of what humans don't have. Donkey showed even being selfish to your own kind is pain and meaningless. We should never be against our own but doesn't mean go against others. Ceaser only wanted to be in peace to live the life Will Rodman gave him. But humans will always think the worst of a different kind that has the same advancement as a enemy. Its not wrong to think the worst but should we take action when they knew Caeser shows mercy?",War for the Planet of the Apes
885,athrowawayname,A movie with such a great protagonist ruined by lazy writing,4,3 November 2017,"I loved the first movie. Second movie was good. This third movie was awful. Why? PLOT CONVENIENCES GALORE Examples: a) Group wants to rescue Caesar but don't know how to get into the facility. At that very second, one of them accidentally falls through a hole in the ground and into a sewer system which conveniently leads them into the facility.b) The apes make their move to escape from the facility which is occupied with hundreds of soldiers and guards. They only had to take down the one guard who was responsible for watching hundreds of the apes.c) Caesar is about to get shot by the opposing army -- An avalanche comes down on them at that very second.d) Caesar and his clan finally arrive at their new home -- Caesar dies right on the spot and becomes a martyr. I understand they want to elevate Caesar's greatness with him dying but he went from looking okay after miles of walking to being dead within a minute (all due to a wound that was never patched up for some reason) There are many more of these. I'm not asking for 100% realistic scenarios, otherwise there would be no movie but this movie was full of lazy writing. Ceasar is a great character but his presence alone cannot carry this movie. There is also the issue of the extremely bad pacing and character inconsistencies (like the girl who wept for a dead ape she only knew for a day but was alright seeing her father dead on the ground)",War for the Planet of the Apes
886,nickswift-40177,Third in series,2,16 November 2017,"I want to give it more, but it is no where near up to the quality of the first two films in the series, by a very large margin. I really enjoyed 'Rise' and thought that 'Dawn' was more than an acceptable sequel, but this one is seriously let down by screenplay, plot, dialogue and is just appears aimless and too incredible.....I believe it missed, quite badly. I will always love the brilliant Andy Serkis, and enigmatic Woody Harrelson who both have been in some stunning movies (Peter Jackson's brilliant 'Lord of the Ring'Trilogy and 'No Country for Old Men' respectively) and Mr Serkis tries keeps the character of Caesar consistent and vibrant even in this film, but the rest of the movie is very slow going, fails to engage a lot of the time, quite soporific in places and I conclude that it has let down the other two really good & exciting movies before it hugely. It could have been so much better if the screenwriters had steered the plot in a completely different direction, and actually had a ""War""! There they should have referred to the great Peter Jackson who was eminently able to show his prowess with the battles in Return of the King. This one really failed. It was full of spent movie themes and tired clichés (e.g. a lot of Vietnam based rescue movies, vengeance for the murder of the family, etc etc). In fact it was more like an Ape version of a Mad Max movie! Only much worse because we were expecting so much more. Very disappointing. I will be cautious when I see the name of the director and writers in further films. They have upset a lot of 'Planet of the Ape' fans and need to redeem themselves.",War for the Planet of the Apes

I cannot find the words to express my disappointment, disgust and downright horror that such a poor film could be associated with this franchise.I am not a film critic, just a film lover but I do know a bad film when I see it and this ranks as one of the worst action Sci-Fi that I have ever seen.Just the fact that Woody Harrelson did not say I love the smell of Napalm in the morning distinguishes it as not knowing what it should be.This is shockingly bad and how dare they sully Jimi Hendrix's music with this rubbish.Rant over.",War for the Planet of the Apes

A bit of Schindlers list with Prince of Egypt thrown in. Bloody Brilliant. Enjoyed it immensely. It definitely isn't a popcorn movie though. While the movie isn't a full all out brawl. It is probably a more accurate depiction of the Horrors of war. I think movies glorify war quite a lot so there many that expected something along the lines of a Lord of the Rings kinda war. This a movie focuses on the personal relationships of our apes and the humans they fights. Everyone's motivations are so clear and thats refreshing now days.

All the actors made fine apes but Serkis as Caesar was brilliant. The only reservation I had was the slow progress of the story line and what I thought was a silly ending.1) Escaping dozens of monkeys were unnoticed when in plain sight of the soldiers. 2)The multi explosions of the wall and then the rest of the camp were well over the top but I suppose if you have got some budget left over , you can't go wrong with a big bang or two! 3) The slow development of the storyline.Movie could have lost at least twenty minutes to move things along.All in all , this is an entertaining movie with very good production standards and acting performances,let down mainly through poor story ending.",War for the Planet of the Apes
