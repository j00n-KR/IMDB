0,Leofwine_draca,Silliest Hollywood blockbuster ever?,4,6 July 2015,"G.I. JOE: RISE OF THE COBRA was a brain-dead Hollywood reworking of the Hasbro toy line in which a group of mentally-challenged thugs (I mean heroes) led by Channing Tatum waged war on various international villains in order to prevent worldly disaster. This sequel offers up more of the same, although thankfully Tatum doesn't appear much on screen and has been supplanted by the better Bruce Willis for much of the running time.I'd have a hard time describing the events of this film, other than to say that the squad are out on a mission of revenge after a number of their own are killed in a surprise attack. The baddies have plans for world dominance thanks to some super technology, and much of it boils down to the exceptionally creepy Jonathan Pryce masquerading as the US President (except he's really Arnold Vosloo...watch the film and you'll see).The plot is complete nonsense of course, and merely an excuse for one big budgeted, zero imagination action sequence after another. This effects-heavy movie tries to be a thrill-ride along the lines of RED or the FAST AND THE FURIOUS franchise but it just feels uninteresting for the most part. There are only so many scenes you can watch of random ninjas fighting and stuff blowing up. It's hardly a workout for the cast, either; Willis and Dwayne Johnson are on autopilot, Lee Byung-Hun has little to work with, Ray Stevenson is a stock villain, and the less said about RZA the better.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
1,SnoopyStyle,They get blown up.,6,7 August 2013,"Duke (Channing Tatum) is the new leader of the G.I. Joe unit. The unit is attacked and only Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) survive. The Joes are replaced by Cobra.Tatum has some fun chemistry with The Rock but right away, he gets killed off. After that, it's a lot of shooting, a lot of muscles with big guns. The Rock is solid but a lot of times, it feels like he's alone in the movie. Adrianne Palicki is tall, skinny, and a little stiff. D.J. Cotrona is little more than a mannequin. Bruce Willis has a smaller role and he seemed to be completely lost. As for the action, it's good that a lot of it is real things blowing up. I always appreciate the effort. I can't recommend paying to watch this.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
2,Prismark10,Not much to Joe,6,18 August 2013,"So the first GI Joe did well at the box office but the critics disliked it.The lead actor had all the charisma of a wooden fence and could be pipped for a best acting award by a dead sheep.Who do you call? The Franchise re-generator, otherwise known as The Rock also called Dwayne Johnson.Channing Tatum returns in this film, mainly because he has shown a spark of talent since the first movie.However the film is then led by Johnson and his team who has to deal with the doppelganger of the President of the USA that we saw in the first film.Strangely we see little of the main villains from the original movie. Maybe the actors did not want to return but Christopher Eccleston and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are absent although Joseph has been replaced by another actor as Cobra Commander.Bruce Willis has been added to the action although he is there for no particular purpose but to add some star status. Snake Eyes seems to get the best action scenes but I suspect this franchise is in trouble.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
3,nogodnomasters,YOU LOVE MY PANTIES,8,6 August 2018,"This is a fun popcorn action film with loads of action, great banter, and a ridiculous plot. Fifteen minutes into the film the G.I. Joes are enemies of the world and the president is an imposter. The Joes must rekindle old alliances and friendships to save the world from the evil-doers.The film incorporates advances in science, miniature drones, and nanotechnology to the extreme. Bruce Willis is added to the mix and James Carvel plays himself in a cameo. The most incredible scene is the mountain fighting which happens about midway. The film appears to be designed for an action game, one in which my character would die in the first 20 minutes. Worth a view on the big screen if all you crave is action.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Plenty of killing",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
4,kosmasp,Extended cut,6,3 August 2013,"Paramount might have angered a few people, when they delayed the movie to make it 3D (and have it on another year because of their own budget reasons), but their move was more than right. I might have ranted about that and I was (and still am) unhappy, that people got suckered into the whole thing, but it doesn't change the fact, that the movie was really successful (BO proved to be really good, so good, that they allegedly already green-lighted a sequel).So how does the movie fair? On its initial theatrical release many people said it wasn't really good (still not affecting the numbers and the success by doing so). The extended version of the movie seems to add a little flavor to it. The beginning is especially good, with a great chemistry shown between Tatum and Johnson (aka The Rock). We know what happens to that though (which also was a reason for speculations about re-shoots).There are a few nice action sequences, the 3D is said to be redundant (and the extended cut is only available as 2D). Not a bad movie, though not superior in any way than the first one was (the first one felt more like a movie that didn't change lanes or speed throughout and was just a fun popcorn movie). There are a few things that make this a sequel (cast, events from the first GI Joe movie being taken over), though you won't miss out on anything particular if you haven't seen the first one (apart from it being funnier that is).",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
5,Tweekums,Plenty of action but the plot was too thin and characters under-developed,3,26 October 2013,"After a mission to retrieve nuclear weapons from an unstable Pakistan the men and women find themselves betrayed by a man they thought they could trust: the US President except the man the world thinks is the president is an impostor; the evil Zartan who intends to use his position take over the world with his Cobra organisation. Only three members of the Joe team in Pakistan survive and they are determined to clear the name of their organisation and stop Zartan's plans. They can't quite do it alone of course and those who help them include Bruce Willis and Storm Shadow; one of the bad guys in the previous film.I'd watched the previous film some time ago but to be honest couldn't remember much about it; that didn't really matter though as the plot here is wafer thin. What plot there is serves to provide an excuse for an almost nonstop succession of action sequences. The constant shooting, sword fighting and explosions were pretty spectacular but there was little tension as I couldn't really care about the protagonists. The acting was okay but I can't see why Bruce Willis or Jonathan Pryce wanted to be in this. Overall I'd not recommend this unless you really liked the previous installment.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
6,BA_Harrison,Not a patch on the first film.,5,5 May 2014,"If you haven't seen the first (and surprisingly enjoyable) G.I. Joe movie, there's an extremely high probability that you won't have the foggiest idea what is going on in this sequel; but even if you have seen the first film, Retaliation might still have you asking quite a few questions.Questions such as: what has happened to a lot of the Joes/villains from the first film (especially babes Ana and Scarlett—I missed them, for obvious reasons)? Why bother getting Channing Tatum back only to kill off his character during the first battle? Is the director of Justin Bieber: Never Say Never (2011) really a good choice to helm this sequel? RZA—why? Does Bruce Willis even bother to read a script these days? What did London do to deserve total destruction?In order to try and take the viewer's mind off these head-scratchers (and numerous others that the lazy script throws up), director Jon M. Chu (who was also responsible for Justin Bieber's Believe) conducts numerous action scenes, full of big explosions, high-tech weaponry, and expendable henchmen for the good guys to shoot, most of which are wholly unimaginative and ultimately rather tedious. A crazy ninja battle on the side of a mountain displays a degree of creativity and an admirable disregard for logic, and proves pretty enjoyable as a result, but I really think that Chu should do action fans a favour in the future and stick to working with Bieber.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
7,paul_haakonsen,"Action, adrenaline, and no-brains...",6,19 July 2013,"I enjoyed the first ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" for what it was, an action movie first and foremost, and without really associating it with the fond memories of the G.I. Joe cartoons back from the 1980s. The same goes with this movie; it is first and foremost and action movie and that is basically it.As a continuation of the first movie, then ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" holds up the reins quite well and delivers right where the first movie left off. However, there was a massive change in characters, lots of the Joes from the first movie never made it to the sequel, and characters from the second movie weren't in the first one.Putting that aside, then lets move on to the story. Well as far as the story goes, then it was pretty much like the first one - Cobra wants to take over the world or see it burn if they can't succeed in doing so, and it is up to the Joes to thwart Cobra's plans. Essentially the same recipe as in the first movie, just with a different setting and backdrop. So is that good or bad? Well, I will say this much, you can safely dismantle your brain and leave it behind when you sit down to watch this movie, as it is all action and adrenaline and next to no storyline at all.You might look at the above-mentioned comments as all negative. But that is hardly the case. I enjoyed the movie for the action and adrenaline that it was, and I entered the movie with no expectations towards the storyline, as I had been seasoned from the first movie.The action sequences in the movie were nice and well executed, and the effects were quite good. I was especially dazzled by the destruction of London, it just looked amazing. But one thing did puzzle me, as Cobra destroyed the Eiffel Tower in the first movie, why was it seen when Paris was on the screen in the conference meeting room? It was just stupid.And the costume of Cobra Commander was also really nice. It was a great touch to the movie, and it held very true to the cartoon and the action figurine from the 1980s toyline.They had some pretty nice names to the billing list, and people did alright with their given roles.If you have seen ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"", you should watch ""G.I. Joe: Retalation"" as well, as it is a direct continuation of the first movie, and provides equally much entertaining and action as the first movie.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
8,sunwarrior13,Superior Than Its First G.I. Joe Film,8,8 April 2013,"G.I. Joe: Retaliation is a science fiction action film based on Hasbro's G.I. Joe toy, comic and media franchises. It is a sequel to G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra that features an ensemble cast, starring Bruce Willis and Dwayne Johnson, with Channing Tatum, Arnold Vosloo, Ray Park, Jonathan Pryce, and Byung-hun Lee.It was directed by Jon M. Chu.The Joes are framed for stealing nuclear warheads from Pakistan by Zartan,who is impersonating the President of the United States. The entire team is eliminated in a military strike, with Duke as one of the casualties. Roadblock, Flint and Lady Jaye are the only survivors.Meanwhile, Storm Shadow and ex-Joe Firefly rescue Cobra Commander from an underground maximum-security prison in Germany. Storm Shadow is injured during the escape, and retreats to a temple in the Himalayas to recover. Upon learning that he is alive, the Blind Master, leader of the Arashikage Clan, sends Snake Eyes and his apprentice Jinx, Storm Shadow's cousin, to capture Storm Shadow so he can answer for the murder of his uncle, the Hard Master.The plot is just a thin outline providing opportunities for lots of shootouts, explosions, chases, kung-fu fighting and massive destruction.There's a decent attempt to humanize the characters and make them more than mere fighting machines.Unfortunately,there are a lot potholes in the logic of the screenplay as it ricochets between interesting characters and idiotic ones, between clever plot developments and ludicrous ones, between smart dialogue and not so smart dialogue that is just purely characterized by marble-mouthed monologues and limp quips.Though arguably superior to its predecessor,the movie is overwhelmed by its nonstop action and too nonsensical and vapid to leave a lasting impression.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
9,Scarecrow-88,GI Joe: Retaliation,5,11 April 2015,"Although Cobra is currently encased in a liquid filled chamber within a supposedly deep sleep in a top secret, heavily guarded underground facility, Zartan (Arnold Vosloo, utterly wasted) is wearing an ""imitation mask"" using nano tech to simulate the face of the current pres of US (Jonathan Pryce), with orders to cause a global nuclear disarmament so that their satellites (containing dangerous missiles that can destroy cities on impact) orbiting the planet dictate total control. With the real pres currently held captive by Cobra forces, the imitation pres declares the GI Joes (stationed in Afghanistan after seizing and disarming a warhead) as turncoats having an armed flight of planes to take them out (all but three survive: Dwayne Johnson, Adrianne Palicky, and DJ Cotrona). So the remaining survivors and a few others (Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and the sister of Cobra ninja Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee), Jinx (Elodie Yung)) will band together (eventually) in an attempt to thwart the efforts of Cobra (Luke Bracey) and his henchmen, Firefly (Ray Stevenson) and Zartan in their terrorist faction's plot to secure global domination. Hoping to learn of the Cobra's plans, GI Joes need to ""turn over to the good side"" Storm Shadow, himself harboring deep seeded revenge against Zartan for killing his master.The plot itself is just there to service the action scenes and special effects which are impressive. It is all absent bloodletting and graphic violence but still the mountain capture of Storm Shadow by Snake Eyes and Jinx where red-suited ninjas chase after them, the bombing of a major city, Johnson's Roadblock's John Woo-ish gunfight with Firefly as the briefcase with codes set to release missiles all across the planet is what both are after, Bruce Willis' ""legend GI Joe"" coming out of retirement to help out the heroes (and presenting them with his incredible cache of weapons in some neatly concealed hiding places in his home), and Channing Tatum's exit from the film thanks to a major explosion after a jeep is blown up are all highlights of this rather forgettable summer diversion. The White House seized by the villains with Cobra insignia flags draping over it is quite a sight, but Cobra Commander's ""big plan"" backfires rather easily. Johnson's charisma helps a lot but the film gives Willis little to do except help Palicky retrieve the kidnapped ""good pres"" which is disappointing considering his status in the film is built up in the advertisements for the film. Channing Tatum's limited showing is akin to Steven Seagal's in Executive Decision: he gets to have his opening raid of an Afghan outpost alongside Johnson with his GI Joe team, and some bonding time with Johnson at home. Pryce has always made a good villain and his mockery of the leaders of the most powerful nations in the world during a nuclear weapons launch is his finest point in the film. But the whole subplot regarding Storm Shadow and blind RZA trying to convince him to join forces with the Joes is a bit shoehorned in the film, but it does allow us to see Snake Eyes and Shadow go at it with some martial arts play. Walter Coggins of Justified has a small, inconsequential role as the man in charge of the facility holding Cobra Commander prisoner (with Shadow responsible for freeing him). Bullets fly, fists punch, and buildings explode, but nothing ever violent or graphic enough to challenge the PG-13 rating. Palicky is the babe of the film, looking particularly nice in a red dress during a presidential ball, trying to get a hair sample to detect his true identity.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
10,zardoz-13,"Not As Good As The First ""G.I. Joe""",7,7 April 2013,"The sequel ""G.I. Joe: The Retaliation"" scraps half of everything in ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra."" Basically, if you missed the first ""Joe,"" then this splendid looking sequel may not make a whole lot of sense, particularly the Presidential hostage scenes. Unless you've seen ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra,"" you won't know Zartan had been tweaking his impersonation of the U.S. President. Despite a sturdy cast and stupendous production values, this futuristic actioneer could have retained several elements that made its predecessor entertaining. The first mistake Paramount and Hasbro made was eliminating everybody but Zartan, the President, and Storm Shadow. Ripcord, General Hawk, Scarlett, Ana, and Destro are A.W.O.L. Well, Destro has a cameo, but we never get a glimpse of him or Christopher Eccleston. Arnold Voslow appears briefly as Zartan, but you could miss him if you blinked your eyes. When the sequel isn't sacrificing top tier cast members, it is rewriting the first film and rehabilitating a villain. Not only is Storm Shadow no longer wicked, but we also learn he had been framed in the first film.Meantime, ""Step Up 3-D"" director Jon M. Chu and ""Zombieland"" scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick introduce several new characters, including Dwayne Johnson as a massive sergeant major, Adrianne Palicki as sexy Lady Jaye, D.J. Cotrona, and Bruce Willis as General Joe Colton. Presumably, the producers brought Bruce Willis on board to beef up things, but he shows up for only a handful of scenes. When he enters combat, he doesn't even have to duck bullets. Bruce takes our heroes on a tour of his armory-like residence, rides in the back of an El Camino with an assault rifle, and later passes out medals. As a character nicknamed 'Roadblock,' Dwayne Johnson saves the day after Channing Tatum makes an early departure about a half-hour into the mêlée. Chu and his scenarists must have seen ""The Expendables 2"" because ""G.I. Joe: The Retaliation"" strikes me more about revenge rather than retaliation. Other things missing are the outlandish Delta 6 accelerator suits that our heroes donned for the Paris sequence of ""G.I. Joe"" and those nasty nanomites that gnaw through armor as if it were candy. As comely as both Adrianne Palicki and Elodie Yung are, they're no match for Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols. The second ""Joe"" comes up light on villains, too. Nobody here can compare with either Christopher Eccleston or Joseph Gordon-Levitt.""G.I. Joe: The Retaliation"" picks up where the first film concluded. The villainous Zartan has completed his masquerade as the President and has managed to fool everybody. Next, he sets out to locate Cobra Commander. As it turns out, Cobra Commander and Destro are imprisoned in a European poky at the bottom of an old East German mine shaft. Warden Nigel James (Walton Goggins) provides Storm Shadow with an expository laden tour of his maximum security facility when he arrives with an escort. Meantime, the President dispatches Captain Duke Hauser (Channing Tatum of ""Magic Mike"") and the G.I. Joes on a secret mission to Pakistan to retrieve some nukes. Initially, our heroes encounter little difficulty and wind up in the Hindus Valley waiting for an extraction team. Suddenly, the worse thing imaginable happens. They are blown to smithereens by their own people. The President (Jonathan Pryce) orders their deaths because he is in reality Zartan. Meantime, Zartan appears on national television and reveals that the G.I. Joes tried to appropriate the atomic bomb for their own use. Fortunately, Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson of ""Snitch""), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki of ""Red Dawn""), and Flint (D. J. Controna of ""Dear John"") survive the sneak attack. Actually, Duke saved Flint but died in the process. The three hide in a convenient well when the mop-up crew arrive. As usual, the villains are too lazy to mop up well enough. They check out the well and fire a couple of shots into it that miss all three crouching just below the surface. A hand grenade would have done nicely, but the heroes have to survive. This is the first mistake that Reese and Wernick made when they let the heroes off too easily. The trio make it back to America and lay low with the help of one of Roadblock's old ghetto friends. Eventually, our heroes contact retired U.S. General Joe Colton (Bruce Willis of ""Die Hard"") who was one of the original Joes. Colton furnishes them with an incredible arsenal and agrees to join them. You can tell this scene was lensed before the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting because it made the final cut. Colton leads our heroes on a tour of his residence. Every drawer and cabinet conceals automatic pistols and assault weapons. While Roadblock and company are acquiring weapons, Snake Eyes (Ray Park of ""X-Men"") and Jinx (Elodie Yung of ""District 13: Ultimatum"") are on the other side of the world. They are scaling the Himalayas mountain to nab Storm Shadow where he is recuperating in a temple. Storm suffered horrible burns on the back when an ex-Joe (Ray Stevenson of ""Punisher: War Zone"") rescued both Cobra Commander and he from the prison. Chu stages the mountain side scene with ninjas tangling on the slopes with some finesse. Paramount Pictures shelved ""G.I. Joe: The Retaliation"" for a year to add 3-D. I've seen both versions, and the 2-D surpasses the 3-D. Furthermore, the 3-D contributes nothing to the action because—like most 3-D movies now-- nothing flies at you. Polished production values, top-notch cinematography, and first-class CGI work, except in Bruce Willis' El Camino scene, distinguish this complicated combat caper with too many characters. The finale with our heroes struggling to prevent the Zeus satellites from destroying Earth generates a palatable amount of suspense. Of course, Cobra Commander eludes everybody, and General Joe hands Roadblock one of General Patton's pistols to bring him back.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
11,view_and_review,G.I. Joe Retaliation Failed to Stand Out,5,7 June 2014,"G.I. Joe: Retaliation (GIJR as I will call it from here on) failed to move me one way or the other. I didn't think the movie was awful, but it was far from good. Hasbro has three movies to its credit by my count: G.I. Joe, Battleship and GIJR. Hasbro should stick to making toys.Nothing really stood out in this movie besides Dwayne Johnson's biceps. There was a lot of action, effects, machismo and heroism but nothing that made me say ""wow"" or sit at the edge of my seat. There was plenty of fighting, shooting and explosions; your standard action movie stuff. I was a fan of the cartoon as a kid but it has failed to translate to the big screen.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
12,HotToastyRag,"Very exciting, great action flick",8,27 June 2019,"If you've seen the preview for G.I. Joe: Retaliation-which you probably did, if you went to the movie theaters at all in 2013-you were treated to what looked like the coolest action comedy ever. You don't even have to watch the first G.I. Joe to know what's going on. Everything gets explained in a tidy little recap, and you're quickly hooked into the new setup. I actually liked the second one better than the first!With the White House taken over by bad guys and all the good guys wiped out except a few, the G.I. Joes certainly have their work cut out for them. And with tons of explosions, a seemingly endless supply of machine guns and other weapons, they're more than ready to step up to the plate. This is a very exciting action movie, even for people who don't normally like that genre. I am not a teenaged boy, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time! Just like many summer blockbusters, there are incredible stunts, tense situations, and a few corny one-liners that make you chuckle even when you don't want to. This one has a bonus, which you'll be anxiously awaiting if you've seen the preview. When everything looks hopeless, the G.I. Joes don't know how they're going to save the country, and Dwayne Johnson says he knows someone who can help them. It's Bruce Willis! He's not on the screen for very long and he has to say a couple of jokes about his age, which is a little sad, but it's very fun to see him come in with a machine gun and save the day. Rent this movie, even if you don't normally like action movies. You'll probably like this one.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
13,FlashCallahan,Call me Jo(k)e........,2,20 April 2013,"Framed for crimes against the country, the G.I. Joe team is terminated by the President's order. The surviving team members face off against Zartan, his accomplices, and the world leaders he has under his influence....The first movie was in our face over the top cheesiness, but it was fun, and had a great cast, including Quaid, Fraser, Eccleston, Levitt, and even Sienna Miller and Marlon Wayans did well.It was criticised forever when it came out, but it had a certain charm to it, and its still fun now, so obviously I was looking forward to the sequel, and even more so that it featured The Rock and Bruce Willis.But after seeing this, I can really understand why they wanted to convert this in order to garner more box office, its almost like having the life sucked out of you, having to enjoy this dire movie.All the film consists of is The Rock, on really poor form here, going from set piece to set piece, having fights, mourning Channing Tatum for literally five seconds, and bumping into Bruce Willis a couple of times and shouting 'oooooooo', whilst trying to clear his name.It's as bad as Transformers, and I feel like Hasbro is becoming the Uwe Boll of companies. Whatever made the first movie fun, is taken away here, and that film even had a clear narrative, here, its just an excuse for okay effects and plenty of explosions.I'm sure if I was fifteen, and had no concept of narrative, editing, or storyline, this would probably be my favourite film ever.But I'm not, and this is awful.Willis is having a bad year.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
14,phd_travel,Lots of action but a confusing movie,2,28 September 2013,I didn't enjoy this exploding mess of a movie. Most action movies have some ridiculous elements but the plot is just not coherent and logical even for this kind of movie.The story: This is a confusing movie. Unless you are familiar with the different comic book characters. There are a lot of new characters. Too many different people fighting each other. Who was fighting who was just too hard to figure out. It seems popular to have a grand story but the global nuclear thing is just overblown for the scope of this movie. Kidnap and punch the President is a bit old now.Action: Lots of fighting but a bit too much of the same thing. Felt I was watching another movie with the Rock but I wan't sure which one. Cast: Some newcomers including the exotic Skyfall's Elodie Yung and Friday Night Light's Adrianne Palicki who is quite a good action heroine. DJ Cotrona looks a bit expressionless. Big role for Korean actor Byung who was in Red 2. Bruce Willis does his cameo with out much action. Quite surprising having Channing Tatum die early on.I don't think they need another GI Joe anything.,G.I. Joe - Retaliation
15,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: G.I. Joe: Retaliation,6,30 March 2013,"This was a film slated for release last Summer, before it was unceremoniously pulled out with some controversy surrounding the decision of post-converting it to 3D. Was it for an increase in box office revenue? Was it because Channing Tatum was such a star that limiting his role in this film will spell disaster? Theories are abound and only time will tell whether this move into the 3D format will result in a decent box office return, but as far as giving Tatum's rising star an acknowledgement, well, that didn't happen. Which is a pity because he would have served as one of the few who had remained from the Joe's first cinematic outing, but perhaps had smelt a stinker that he wanted out from, pronto.This time round, like what the Fast and Furious franchise did in introducing a heavy-weight character with Dwayne Johnson's presence, GI Joe had decided it will now pass the baton given its exodus of stars, and have The Rock carry the film on his broad shoulders. As Roadblock, he plays the reluctant leader, preferring to let Tatum's Duke continue in taking the lead, until he had to step up with two other remaining survivors Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) into wondering just who had sucker punched the entire elite force. They're up against Cobra Commander - a pity that Joseph Gordon Levitt is no longer involved, but face it, with his entire face covered even I could have played the role - Firefly (Ray Stevenson) and Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), the usual Cobra suspects who now have control over the White House and the Presidency (Jonathan Pryce) thanks to nano-technology boosted face masks, and the heroes have to seek out old timer and the original Joe (Bruce Willis) whose retirement plan granted him a house full of weaponry that would make him a grade A terrorist should he go rogue.Then it dawned upon you that this film could have had its plug pulled, in order to give more air time to Lee Byung-Hun as Storm Shadow, because out of the blue you suddenly have the Storm Shadow-Snake Eyes (Ray Park) arc thrust to the forefront as the second parallel narrative, and naturally an increase in Lee's minutes in the film in order to boost the movie's standing in the Asian territories. Smart move by scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick in linking the two GI Joe movies through the two character's rivalry, and offering that chance of redemption, sort of like giving one side the advantage since he's having a bigger fan base that can be milked.So while it's practical and pragmatic, in comes the usual formula of set action pieces that look great, but didn't offer much, since it's nothing more than the usual fire fight, sword fight, and plenty of shoot-em-up accuracy issues that plague cartoons from time immemorial. Granted that part of the fun is to witness the GI Joes and Cobra sides go at each other with weapons uninvented and near impossible even in today's context, it turned out to be nothing more than a live action film of the cartoon it is based on, with an eye out for revenue through its merchandising and toys. You can just about predict everything from start to end since there's little story, and the dramatic moments were so painful to watch that you'd wish things start blowing up on screen just to keep the narrative going.And while it had an ensemble cast to boast of, comparable to the first film, everyone seemed to be sleepwalking their way to their paycheck. Bruce Willis plays Bruce Willis, smirking his presence as the General retired from active duty to make menial contribution to the plot, if not to boost the star power for the film. Adrianne Palicki and D.J. Cotrona were forgettable as well, while The Rock thankfully had that final fisticuffs scene that wowed a little as Roadblock and Firefly go up against each other in close quartered combat with fists and firearms, which was a lift from its immediate preceding sequence involving his piloting a pumped up tank- busting buggy.It may have been a tad interesting if Cobra's threat in the trailer was right from the onset, rather than a passing thought for the finale - it was a maniacal and implausible doomsday scenario - and like most American action blockbusters, perhaps offensive as well in giving the middle finger to other countries through its use of technology to annihilate rival cities. Paris got chomped down by the nanomites in the first film, and now London got obliterated without emotion. Take your pick in which other global city will be next in going down the CG way when the GI Joes return for another outing, if the box office return permits it.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
16,siderite,"I so wanted to like it, but I couldn't",6,6 July 2013,"The first G.I. Joe film was a surprise. I had expected to hate it or at least just enjoy it as a no brainer, but it wasn't so at all. I really liked the special effects, the villains, the story. The reason why I had made the effort of watching it was the appearance of Retaliation, which had really nice trailers.So, after much waiting, I was able to watch G.I. Joe Retaliation... and I found it lacking in every respect. The jokes lamer, the effects cheaper, the story linear and impossible and the script bad, the acting worse, the fighting stupid. My conclusion: a failure that not even the presence of Ray Stevenson could not save. Arnold Vosloo practically did not act in this film, while some of the characters were killed outright for no other reason that I can see except that their actors didn't want to play this film.Don't watch this. It's a waste of time.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

18,KineticSeoul,Entertaining and very watchable action movie,7,3 April 2013,"This surpasses the first one in every way. It's less over the top and more down to earth but it's still cooler and more entertaining to watch. It doesn't have a very intelligent script and some scenes and scenarios don't make much sense or just not necessary including few characters. But it's didn't get annoying to watch and the extras didn't really take away from this movie watching experience. I guess Channing Tatum couldn't give a lot of time to this movie so he is in this just for a short while as Duke and is soon replaced by The Rock who plays Roadblock. And he is a badass soldier in this and stands out more than Channing Tatum. Since Lee Byung-hun was good as Storm Shadow in the previous flick so he is back. Bruce Willis is in this as Joe, he isn't a prominent character in this and wasn't all that necessary but he didn't take anything away from this flick either. Adrianne Palicki is in this as Lady Jaye, basically they wanted a attractive female lead because hot girls wielding guns sells and I ain't complaining. Especially for a entertaining popcorn flick as this one. There is however this one actor that plays Flint who is this soldier that does parkour but let's just say he should not act. If there is an actor that is the epitome of not standing out he would be one of them. Even David Belle would have been a better choice. Even the villains stand out more this time around, even side villains like Firefly who constantly reminded me of The Pain from ""Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater"". The structure and the weapons this time around is also more down to earth and the characters as well, at least compared to ""The Rise of Cobra"". But the structure of it all and how the characters work together is well done. Overall this is a entertaining and very watchable popcorn flick. It's basically good as ""The Expendables 2"" despite it not having as much violence.7.5/10",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
19,Buddy-51,All the retaliation seems to be aimed at the audience,3,23 December 2013,"""Preposterous"" does not even begin to describe ""GI Joe: Retaliation,"" which regales us with the further adventures of Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki of ""Friday Night Lights"" fame and, oh, how the mighty have fallen!) as a trio of specially-trained operatives referred to - and always in the most reverential and jingoistic of tones - as ""the Joes."" In one of those President-in-Peril scenarios that have become all the rage in Hollywood these days, the dastardly criminal organization known as COBRA has kidnapped the POTUS (Jonathan Price) and replaced him with an evil look-alike as part of a mad scheme to take over the world through nuclear blackmail. Only these three Joes and the reformed ninja, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee), apparently, can prevent that from happening.Written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick and directed by Jon M. Chu, this sequel to the 2009 original follows the well-oiled but still creaky formula to a tee: find as many things and people as you can to shoot down or blow up, toss in some tough-guy talk and posturing, then add a few snappy one-liners, an assortment of cool CGI effects, some serious gun fetishism and you've got what it takes to make an action movie in the 21st Century. Everything except brains and believability, that is.However, in all fairness, this one does at least throw in a bit of Zen-wisdom pseudo-profundity in a futile stab at respectability.In addition to the aforementioned actors, Bruce Willis, Walter Goggins and even James Carville, more or less playing himself, put in brief appearances. Lucky for him, Channing Tatum gets to boogie on out of the place early on.At times more a parody of an action movie than an action movie itself, ""GI Joe: Retaliation"" doesn't bode well for the future of the franchise.",G.I.

20,thesar-2,"Yo, Joe, Too",6,31 March 2013,"Two things happened as G.I. Joe: Retaliation progressed: the script revealed itself as being written by a ghostwriter – literally, a ghost, and, secondly, I had a ton of fun.While the first part can be written about any of the Transformers films, the second is far from accurate to those terrible films. I don't know what it is, or how they could of screwed up that franchise so badly; the Transformers were higher on my list of toys I grew up with than the G.I. Joe action figures, even though I played with both.I haven't seen the first G.I. Joe film since it came out in 2009, so it's hard to make a current comparison. But, I can say, I had an entertaining ride during both. Perhaps it was the same kinds of action that was in the original series' cartoons, or maybe, the cast always seems to have the right amount of charisma. Here, in the (hopefully, first of many) sequel(s), I loved the cast, including the Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis. That last choice rarely makes a mistake in movies, so when he did in the previous 2013 Willis release, A Good Day to Die Hard, it was nice to see a little, ah-hem, retaliation in this movie.As stated, the screenplay was just the pits – and it got progressively worse as the movie concluded, but just for review's sake, the movie is the same ole scene: the elite and patriotic soldiers, or ""the Joes,"" are framed and the President's being duplicated and run by the evil Cobra villains. Their plan? Well, kinda, sorta, rule the world? What is the evil plot of any cartoon race of bad guys?The Joes, now outnumbered and outgunned by approximately 99 to 1, still manage to use their resources to fight the enemy.My synopsis is a very basic retelling of the many-times-over retelling of dozens of filmsbut that's incidental to the action.The fighting, gadgets and choreographed scenes weren't anything new themselves, aside from the great mountain fight with my favorite Joe of all-time: Snake Eyes, but they were still wildly engaging. And there are more than enough of them. Once you get a tad bit bored or confused – rightfully so with the multiples of plot holes – with the story, they throw another action segment to get you by.This is a life-action cartoon, nothing more. It's for people who grew up on the animated series, the comic books and action figureslike me. But, that wouldn't have been enough for me. If not for the action, the fun characters by the actors, or the humorous lines – yeah, I did laugh out loud a few times, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this as much.YesI do recommend G.I. Joe: Retaliation. If, again, you fit that persona I described in the previous paragraph.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
21,FeastMode,better in every way,6,28 July 2021,"I gave rise of the cobra 3 stars. It's terrible on almost every level and has only one stand-out action scene. This movie is an improvement on everything. A top reviewer talks about it being more charismatic than its predecessor. I've never thought a movie was capable of being charismatic, but that's a perfect description. Much of it comes from casting the rock.Other than being charismatic, it's funnier, has better characters, significantly cooler villains, and a musical score that enhances the scenes. And the action is miles ahead. Most of it was awesome and clear. All types of action. All intense. Some of it very creative. The snow mountain scene? Wow. And two martial artists can have a good fight scene???? Tell that to the first movieThere is still some dumb stuff, but it's much easier to forgive when you're enjoying the movie. I had a good time and could see myself choosing this again when in the mood for mindless action (2 viewings, 7/27/2021)",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
22,Robert_duder,Slightly better than the first but really just more of the same,7,6 April 2013,"I have to say the exact same about this movie that I did for the first one. If you walk out of this movie complaining about it then you went in with ridiculous expectations. This movie, as the first, are exactly what they purport to be--Action, special effects, and based on a cheesy 80's cartoon. The sequel is almost more of a reboot. They really changed the entire concept of the GI Joes, doing away with their futuristic physically enhancing suits and sort of eliminating everything that made the first one GI Joe. That's not necessarily a bad thing because the first film was sub par at best. There is still plenty of action in this film with a very similar plot to the first film. New characters abound as the old ones are left unmentioned or eliminated in the case of ""Duke."" I actually enjoyed that the film felt a little more realistic and less futuristic and the addition of certain members of the new cast was welcomed. As usual, in my opinion, the 3D was completely pointless. The only time it looked even remotely cool was the Ninja fight on the mountainside which was an impressive and fun scene regardless of the 3D. They also completely overhauled Cobra Commander's mask from the first movie so that he actually looks like Cobra Commander from the series. He was still hardly the villain though.I realized in the course of watching this something shocking. I really like Dwayne Johnson. He has an insane amount of on screen chemistry and he takes over the lead of this film perfectly. Whether or not he really embraces the GI Joe concept remains to be seen but as an action character in an action flick, he is one of the redeeming qualities of this film. Byung-hun Lee and Ray Park return from the first film and they are exactly the same as they were in the first. That is both a compliment and a negative. Both men have an intensity and some amazing martial arts moves and both characters seem to get the most back story but neither one really stands out in the mediocre script. Much with the first film the supporting characters have such little development that you hardly notice them. DJ Cotrona and Adrianne Palicki round out the main team opposite the Rock but (especially Cotrona) has virtually no real scenes and no personality whatsoever to their characters. Palicki at least gets a little bit to play with but she is way underused and that's unfortunate because she does a decent job. Jonathan Pryce also returns from the first film but gets a much bigger part and does quite well at it. He is very good in his dual roles as villain and President of The United States. I was actually surprised because I didn't realize Channing Tatum wasn't returning for the whole film. He has almost a cameo role which even that was apparently made bigger to appease fans but he isn't there much. Luke Bracey is good as the new Cobra Commander (considering the character was hardly in the first film.) He is once again underused in this film when he should be the biggest villain. I can't honestly say anyone else is worth mentioning. They either have incredibly small roles or roles not worth mentioning because of lack of development. Bruce Willis (one of my personal Hollywood idols) is barely in the film which I sort of expected. I mean, just him being there for me upped the ante of the film but it was a such an unfortunately small role.I would have thought with a second film that they appeared to be trying to reboot they would have thought very carefully about choice of director. Instead they choose Jon Chu...best known for Dance movies and singers' documentaries. He doesn't have a single piece of experience at an action flick. This film could have easily not been GI Joe. Outside of the familiar GI Joe names there is nothing about the film that makes this uniquely ""GI Joe."" It might have even been a better choice for them to make this just another ""Rock"" action flick. Now I realize that I sound like I'm really down on this film but I'm not. It was mildly entertaining, it had fun scenes, some good dialogue between some of the characters and some decent action sequences. Both films are just mediocre in every way. Its unfortunate because given the proper director and some more dedicated producers they could have turned this into something significant the likes of which the original Transformers was. 7/10",G.I.

23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"When it stops trying to tell a story, there's fleeting enjoyment in the spectacle.",5,14 July 2018,"'G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013)' may not be quite as dumb as its predecessor but that comes at a cost, a sense of self-seriousness that isn't matched by the plot's credibility or fluctuating tone. As such, the piece sits in the uncomfortable middle ground of being too straight-forward to be 'turn-your-brain-off', tongue-in-cheek fun that knows what it is and relishes it, but also not being quite silly enough to avoid seeming like a poor attempt at a gritty, realistic realisation of the beloved brand. There are all sorts of issues peppered throughout the brisk but seemingly brief plot. These include a bizarre 'ninja mountain' aside that goes on far far too long without being connected enough to the main narrative, some odd retroactive tweaking that comes across as nothing other as stupid, a sense of disconnection from its predecessor but enough attachment to the franchise that the omissions feel strange while the hold-ons feel daft and some real problematic moments portraying its main female 'Joe', wherein the character is blatantly sexualised usually just after or during scenes in which she talks about feeling like she often comes 'second place' to her male counter-parts, scenes in which those same men tend to assure her that is certainly not the case. Overall, though, it is difficult to care enough about any of the schlock to really get down about it. Admittedly, there's fleeting enjoyment when the filmmakers stop trying to make a story and just focus on their limited spectacle instead. 5/10",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
24,bowmanblue,Wow - possibly the most average film ever,6,16 August 2014,"I've just watched G.I. Joe: Retaliation and I can honestly say I can hardly remember anything about it. I never played with the toys, or read the comics when I was little, so my first experience of the franchise was from the 2009 movie - which I actually enjoyed. The first film was a daft, silly little action affair. You could tell it was based on some sort of comic book and the characters were bright and colourful. All in all, a lot of fun.Therefore, I expected the same with its sequel. Plus I'm a fan of both Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis, so I couldn't see how I could be disappointed. However, I am.There's not a thing I can say positive about G.I. Joe: Retaliation, but then there's absolutely nothing negative I can say either. It's failed to leave any sort of impression on me at all. I seem to remember it had explosions and guns and stuff, but it was all jumbled and seemed to lack any cohesion or charm (plus, if you're a fan of Bruce Willis then you should be warned that he doesn't come into the story until fifty minutes and has a total of about five minutes screen time all in all).Perhaps the problem with any film which involves numerous 'central' characters is that you can't get a feel for them all because there simply isn't enough time to flesh them all out. Some films just about pull it off (ala X-Men), but G.I. Joe: Retaliation doesn't. There are too many people doing too many things that don't really tie up - or don't tie up enough to really make this film little more than a collection of loosely-connected scenes where things explode.Yes, it's an action movie. And it has action. But little else. It's not bad, but it's just not good either.

25,g-bodyl,G.I. Joes Are Much Better This Time Around!,9,28 June 2014,"G.I. Joe: Retaliation is the sequel to the much maligned 2009 film, Rise of the Cobra. While I did enjoy the first film to a fault, I think it's much better this time around. Unlike Rise, this film is less campy and has a more serious overtone. There is still some well-timed humor to like. The action is incredible and it certainly outdid it's predecessor.Jon M. Chu's film takes place several years after the events of Rise. In this film, a revolution is in progress led by the fearful Cobra Commander and his comrades. But it's up to the Joes led by Duke Hauser and Roadblock to put an end to this rebellion. But with the government infiltrated, it may not be an easy task.This time around, the cast is bigger with more brand-name stars here. First, Channing Tatum was good and if rumors had it, his screen time certainly was expanded. Dwayne Johnson was an excellent addition to the cast and his persona fills up the screen. Bruce Willis was another good addition to the cast and quite frankly, who doesn't love Bruce in these kind of films.Overall, G.I. Joe: Retaliation is bigger, badder, and better than the first film. These kind of films certainly bring out my inner kid and I can't help enjoying them no matter how preposterous they are. This film stretches its plausibility just a little bit, but what does it matter. It has plenty of explosions and action to make my inner kid happy. Also, this film was directed by the guy who did the Justin Bieber film. Who would have thought that? I rate this film 9/10.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

The plot of this movie is that a member of Cobra has infiltrated the White House disguised as the President. He frames G. I. Joe for the assassination of the leader of Pakistan.The movie stars Dwayne Johnson, who is honestly a good actor. Bruce Willis also appears, but he doesn't have that much of a role.

Joe: Retaliation is a brutal movie with a very poorly developed plot and a cast that seem to have no interest beyond getting their paycheck. It really had nothing that grabbed me in anyway beyond the charisma of Dwayne Johnson, who steals every scene as a result of being the only performer who seemed passionate about this project. Joining The Rock are the likes of Channing Tatum, Walton Goggins, Adrianne Palicki and Bruce Willis, all delivering some of their worse work. There really is nothing about this movie that worked out practically, the visual effects are completely ineffective, looking lazily rendered and thrown together. As well as that, the action sequences are completely uninspired, without anything unique or unexpected occurring throughout. In terms of plot, it did not have a high standard to follow after Rise of the Cobra, and yet it still managed to pass it out in terms of poor quality writing. Nothing happens in the story throughout that surprised me in any way, each plot point is predictable and the dialogue is simply cringe to listen to on several occasions. Unexceptional from start to finish. Partially saved by Dwayne Johnson's natural screen presence, but he deserved so much better than this, G.I. Joe: Retaliation should be avoided by everyone.

I grew up watching the cartoon and I thought that was OK but I was more of a He-Man fan then G.I. Joe...but that is neither here nor there. To me the first one just had no real excitement and was kind of boring. I will admit that this one was way better then the first one and actually kept me watching all the way to the end. The dialog is almost as bad as Batman & Robin's but in a movie like this all you really care about is what blows up. Which brings me to my final problem with movies like this. They don't show blood or any real violence in order to keep the PG-13 rating. A lot o parents still think it's too violent for their kids and don't let them watch movies like this. On the other hand since it' not violent enough for an R most parents don't watch either. That leaves this movie in a no-man's land. Overall, much better then the first one, but that's about it.

An occasionally schizophrenic blend of prodigal-son kung-fu film and testosterone-fueled men-on-a-mission romp, G.I. Joe: Retaliation is the kind of large-scale action movie in which the entire world is the stage, the laws of physics don't apply, and every implausible plot development is giddily pursued without a glimmer of irony. Opening with character introductions inspired by the ""file cards"" that came with the original action figures, it knows exactly what audiences expect of it and pulls out all the stops to deliver. Meanwhile, the entire cast go for broke, with Ray Stevenson and Jonathan Pryce in particular obviously having a blast, and fun cameos by Walton Goggins and RZA add some energy to the incidental scenes.

33,Vartiainen,Suffers from lack of caring,4,15 June 2014,"Say what you will about the first G.I. Joe movie, at least it was fun to watch and full of high-octane action scenes. It was dumb and silly, don't get me wrong, but it had a certain charm to it.Can't say the same about the sequel. And yet, whereas most sequels try to ramp up the action, premises and plots, making them seem more silly in the process, this film seems to have it strangely backwards. It tries to take itself more seriously, which only makes it seem more average and banal in the process. Where's the fun in watching dudes act like common soldiers if you're expecting to see a G.I. Joe film? Sure, there are certain scenes that are genuinely inventive and outlandish, but compared to the first film they are few and far between.This strange null feeling isn't helped at all by the actors. None of them seem to care about their roles all that much, and even the addition of Bruce Willis doesn't help because he seems to care the least.That being said, the film looks good, some of the action scenes are fun to watch and the feud between Snake-Eyes (Ray Park) and Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) continues strong. The last one doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all, but it's fun to watch - I'll take what I can get. Minor props should also be given to the film makers for actually logically continuing the story from the first film. Not as common as it should be, so kudos.To sum it up, it's worth checking out if you honestly liked the first one and want to see the story continued.

Duke is now with Roadblock (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) , who would later become the team leader after a attack by their own government. Duke becomes the casualty, and the President brands them renegades of the Armed Forces. He would later replace them with Cobra Forces. Cobra, however is a terrorist organization destined for world domination. In an underground prison, Snake Eyes has been captured and placed with Cobra Commander and Destro. Snake Eyes was indeed Storm Shadow in disguise. He frees Cobra Commander, but Destro is left behind. And the President, he's in the bunker of his retreat, as a prisoner. So who's at the Oval Office?

The 9-11 attack on America destroyed just a tiny smidgen of Manhattan, Washington, and the U.S. corn field supply. About 3,000 people died, including dozens of foreigners. This movie assumes the world could endure an attack 300,100% (or 3,000 times) WORSE than 9-11 and pick up as if nothing ever happened, and NOT blame the Joes for failing to prevent the usurping of their close buddy, the U.S. President.

I didn't like the first film despite all the great special effects because the entire concept was just way too silly, and I didn't like this film all that much either despite the fact it had a better story and some more interesting characters. What really saved this film for me was a ten minute action scene in the mountains which was pretty amazing and made the entire movie worthwhile. It was one of the best action scenes I've seen all year. This second film was directed by Jon M. Chu (Justin Bieber Never Say Never and Step Up 2) and the screenplay co-written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (Zombieland), but very few actors are back from the original movie (only five) so this felt like a totally different movie. Retaliation is much better than Rise of Cobra but it still felt a little light due to the nonstop action. It's one of those movies you can enjoy for two hours but forget about once it's over. What it does have going for it is that is includes better action stars like The Rock and Bruce Willis. The Rock is probably one of the best contemporary action stars and he already brought the Fast and Furious franchise back alive again. He doesn't quite do the same with GI Joe, but he still makes this movie a little more enjoyable than the original one. Despite all the cheesiness of the plot I still had some fun, and the producers knew that the premise couldn't be taken seriously so they just played around with it.The Joes continue to serve and protect the world under the leadership of Captain Duke (Channing Tatum) and his team which consists of Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). They have a couple of successful missions until the team is betrayed by the US president (Jonathan Pryce) who is actually Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) infiltrated as him. Thus the Joes are forced to fight enemy forces inside their own government and are forced to receive help from the only person they can trust: retired General Joe Colton (Bruce Willis). Meanwhile Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) has conceived a plan with Firefly (Ray Stevenson) to free their imprisoned Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey). Snake Eyes (Ray Park) is determined to stop him with the help of Jinx (Elodie Yung), but the Joes are running out of time with the President threatening the world with a nuclear war. Will the Joes be able to stop the Cobra team before they destroy the entire world?Channing Tatum and The Rock shared some funny scenes together and had great chemistry, but I would have enjoyed more screen time with them. Adrianne Palicki looked great in that red dress and was a good addition to the film. Cotrona and Willis didn't do much, but the highlight of the film was the mountain action sequence between Park and Lee. The film had its extremely cheesy moments, and I couldn't believe they even didn't care about the explosion of London. They continued as if nothing ever happened and celebrated the success of the mission without considering the devastating loss. I think that was probably the worst part of the film and the entire scene was probably used to attract people through the trailers. Retaliation is big and loud, anticipation for what is to come in the blockbuster summer movies. By the time summer gets here we will probably have forgotten all about this movie, but it was still a fun and entertaining two hours. Even those people that will end up hating this film will have to agree that the ten minute action scene between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow was pretty entertaining. As long as you don't think too much about what's going on you might enjoy this senseless film.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
39,Fluke_Skywalker,A (small) step in the right direction,5,16 August 2013,"I'm a huge G.I Joe fan. For me, it's the only pop culture entity that can compete with Star Wars. The first live-action film, 'Rise of Cobra', was garbage. Not even a good action film, let alone a good G.I. Joe film. In regard to the latter it was actually kinda insulting, so when the sequel hit theaters this Spring, I passed. This time around they amended some of the previous film's mistakes (Particularly fixing its most egregious error; making the Joes a PC ""International"" team), added franchise saver Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, and managed to pull off a decent action film, and a better—if still not right—G.I. Joe flick.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
40,3xHCCH,The Great Channing Tatum Deception,7,30 March 2013,"Honestly I do not remember at all if I had seen the first G.I. Joe film at all back in 2009. I think I did but I was not sure, even as I lined up on opening day in theaters with my family today. Even my kids don't recall anything about the first film if we did watch it at all.In this film, the story was exciting at the onset as the US President (Jonathan Pryce) was replaced by a lookalike who was technically transformed Cobra operative Zartan (also Pryce, over Arnold Vosloo). This fake President wastes no time in decimating the entire GI Joe camp, surprisingly including Part 1 hero Duke (Channing Tatum), all that in the first 10 minutes!Of course, three Joes namely Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrienne Palicki) and Flint (DJ Cotrona)) survive the attack to save the day for the good guys. On the other side of the world in Tokyo, two more Joes (Snake Eyes and Jinx) join forces, bringing with them a ""reformed"" (?) Cobra seeking to revenge the death of his master. Together with General Joe Colton (Bruce Willis), they fight against the Cobra Commander who seeks world domination (what else?)As expected the action sequences were very well-executed. The most breathtaking would be a flying and swinging fight among ninjas on snowy rocky cliff sides. All the sword, gun and fist fights were all so well choreographed and shot. A memorable Cobra minion is Firefly (Ray Stevenson) with this little mechanical flying bugs, which turn out to be highly explosive bombs. Getting the world leaders of countries with nuclear capability together to blackmail them into doing Cobra's will was a cool idea. However, even when London was seen to be destroyed, the reaction seemed to be so inexplicably understated. Overall it was a good way to spend two hours of a lazy Saturday afternoon with the family. However, by the time the next sequel comes along, I don't think I will remember much about this sequel at all, but that remains to be seen.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
41,TdSmth5,I was hoping for more,8,8 January 2014,"The Joes are in Korea rescuing some guy. This mission has nothing to do with anything, but it barely serves to introduce us to the characters. Next, when Pakistan erupts in chaos, the presidents decides to send them there to secure the nukes. They succeed and at night the president orders them wiped out. All but three survive. The guy in charge now (Dwayne Johnson), a pretty girl and some other guy, go back home somehow and try and make contact with any other remaining Joes somewhere. Jinx and Snake Eyes just have captured Storm Shadow who earlier freed a couple of really bad Cobra guys, including the Cobra Commander who joins Zartan who's running the country.The Joes meet up with the original Joe, figure out that the president is a double and realize that at the next meeting of the world's nuclear powers, he will most likely do something naughty. And they're right. The cobras have launched Zeus satellites into space which drop a tungsten rod to earth which has cataclysmic destructive effects. And Zartan displays the power of the weapon by destroying London, not before getting the world to destroy their nuclear arsenal. Now the Cobra commander demands complete submission from the world's leaders and actually plans to destroy a couple more cities, if the Joes don't get ahold of the Zeus football in time.Retaliation is not as strong as Rise of Cobra. The story isn't as compelling, the action not as exhilarating--with the exception of the stunning scene in the mountains. The characters are paper thin and the Channing Tatum's lead is sorely missing. Johnson doesn't cut it as a lead and he just looks too weird. Catrona is fairly weak. Missing also is the lovely Sienna Miller and Dennis Quaid. Fortunately there is no Wayans. We get though the likable Ray Stevens, but not enough of him, and Walton Goggins and the pretty Adrianne Palicki. Bruce Willis is in this also for some reason--can't Hollywood make an action movie without him? Director Chu is clearly happier when throwing CGI stuff on the screen than when directing people. And they're hiring this guy to do part 3? Why? What little dialog there is has been dumbed down quite a bit to vulgar teen level.Retaliation's potential isn't realized unfortunately. It's a mostly entertaining, fast-paced action movie that overwhelms with out-of-place drone sounds but doesn't give you a character to care for. Still, it's a slightly above-average summer blockbuster.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
42,masonsaul,Stronger sequel,8,16 August 2021,"G. I. Joe: Retaliation has a flawed narrative but it's still a sequel that's stronger than the original with improved character designs. Dwayne Johnson gives a great and charismatic lead performance and Bruce Willis, Jonathan Pryce, Byung-Hun Lee and Adrianne Palicki are all really good. Jon M. Chu's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and visually slick. The CG is excellent, it's well paced and the music by Henry Jackman is good.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
43,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Cinematic dog vomit,4,1 February 2021,"This movie is nothing more than a pastiche of every action sequence ever. There are cars, boats, tanks, fist-fights, shootouts, standoffs, missile launches.Look, there's The Rock doing The Rock things. And a super-anti-hero. And the president's double. A red button. A hot chick. A chinese guy so the studio can pander to the Uigher-murdering market. And of course a cameo by Bruce Willis.I bet the dateless 15-year-old boys who filled the theaters to watch this garbage enjoyed themselves. It gave me a headache.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
44,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"Still entertaining, but there are numerous holes",6,21 March 2014,"Stephen Sommers' G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009) was not an amazing film but it was a fun one. With a lighthearted tone, energetic action sequences and different characters, it was a summer movie most people ended up watching. Surprisingly, it took four years for the next chapter of the Joe's to be told. Even if movies don't fair well with critics (like this one did), if it earned enough money, a sequel will most likely be produced. With all this time one would think that the crew had enough time to perfect this project so it connected with its parent well. Eh....it kind of does....and doesn't.Starting off pretty much where the first ended, the Joe's are still among the highest regarded force in the world. They are also still on red alert for losing Cobra Commander and Zartan (who is now disguised as the American president). Audiences are then brought back to Duke (Channing Tatum) where we see that he is well integrated in the Joe system and has new friends - Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). That's not all though, Cobra Commander has also added a new team member - Firefly (Ray Stevenson). Thus bringing up the first flaw, character continuity. Where is it?Writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick must not know what a sequel script to a movie entails if a story is being continued. Though they have proved they can write; Zombieland (2009) is the prime example. Here, Reese and Wernick return, exclude and eliminate various characters as if they weren't an integral part of what made the first movie work. What happened to Ripcord, Breaker, Scarlett, Baroness and Heavy Duty? A visual appearance isn't even needed, the writers could just have included a verbal cameo about them mentioning what happened to them. Is it too hard to include? It shouldn't be. Also the return of Storm Shadow is questionable. The first movie he was killed,.......so how did he survive? No explanation.Explaining things seems to be an issue for this movie. Not only for the old but the new. For example, when did Duke meet Roadblock and the rest of his new found buddies? Who is Firefly? Where did he come from and why does he have an obsession with exploding mechanical fireflies? It's frustrating because these characters have respectable personalities but very little of it is looked at. The only new characters that are really given any kind of a back-story are Jaye and Roadblock. But even then, their stories sound unfinished and slim. One thing that surprised me was that a question of mine from the first movie was answered here. Who is the real G.I. Joe? Well I got it - it's Bruce Willis, what a shock. Even Willis' background is brushed over, which fans may feel like they were given the slip.However, the acting isn't bad. Dwayne Johnson and his Joe counterparts work effectively together. The Cobra Commander is still a faceless enemy (which they actually got the correct look for this movie), but his voice should've been higher pitched and not so deep. Cobra Commander was never supposed to sound demonic, he was kind of like a new age Skeletor. With the commander comes Firefly (Ray Stevenson), a snarky southern man with a nasty scar on his face who can actually hold his own against Dwayne Johnson. Why doesn't Hollywood see the opportunities in this man? Stevenson is about as underrated as his other Punisher counterpart Thomas Jane. Both are immensely capable of action movies and no one bothers to hire them.Directing this sequel is Jon M. Chu who is better known for directing the ""Step Up"" sequels (which is where Tatum started surprisingly) and the first two Justin Bieber documentaries. Mr. Chu doesn't have a track record with action films and for his first time, he did well. Much of the action sequences were executed professionally. Then again, that could be the work of Jim May and Roger Barton's editing skills. The cinematography is good thanks to Stephen F. Windon. Lastly, Henry Jackman's score was executed nicely too. He had the right emotion and tone set for each scene but what did surprise me is that he didn't include a theme like Alan Silvestri did for the first movie. A franchise like this has to have a main theme. It is still entertaining but it has big loopholes.It's not bad sequel at all to the first movie, but its continuity is all over the place. Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis with big explosions only goes so far. Without accounting for the new and old parts in plot, the story begins to have a disconnect.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
45,Rob_Taylor,GI Don't know how I sat through it!,5,22 July 2013,"Well... not quite. It has some entertaining moments. But I am forced to admit that superhuman acts of strength, courage and agility are wearing a little thin for me at the movies. I mean, I can accept that from actual superhero flicks, but this sequel tried a little too hard to ground itself in reality.The result is a movie that doesn't have the strength to carry on the convictions of the source material. GI Joe 2 is a poor sequel. Sure, they managed to shoehorn the Rock and Bruce Willis into it, and tried a little with the story, but the end result is about as aesthetically pleasing as one of those portraits your kid does of you when they are four years old. In other words, nothing at all realistic and full of bright colours and poorly drawn features.GIJ2 also exhibits some of Van Helsing's questionable ""swinging on ropes"" physics, a villain that is just ridiculously laughable every time he's on screen and a bunch of less than convincing CGI here and there.My favourite bit of rubbish, however, was in one of the mountain fight scenes. Here are our heroes, way, way, way up on craggy peaks and snowy mountains. An area so dangerous they need to climb carefully to get around. The sort of scene where you might hear the distant cry of an eagle, right? No. Not here. Whoever was responsible for putting a peacock's cry into what is essentially a Matterhorn moment needs a slap. Peacock's are a lot of things, but frosty mountain peaks are not their favored habitat! It couldn't be more wrong if they played the Woody Woodpecker laugh instead! All in all then, a poor movie and a weak sequel. I was never that fond of the first one but, after seeing this, with it's troubled production history, one can't help but think they just wanted to get it over and done with, and it shows.I suppose I should balance the negatives and say something good about the film, but the only thing I can come up with is....It isn't A Good Day to Die Hard!SUMMARY: Dull nonsense that is really aimed at small kids. Of limited appeal to adults.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
46,brando647,Pretty Bad when RISE OF COBRA is the Superior Film...,5,27 September 2013,"The first film, RISE OF COBRA, was stupid fun. It knew what it was and it embraced the campiness. How else can you explain casting Marlon Wayans, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's bizarre bobble-head performance as Cobra Commander, and the sci-fi/cartoon tech (metal-eating nanomites, enhancement mech-suits, etc.)? For that reason, as stupid as it was, at least it was a fun time. RETALIATION has none of that, instead choosing to take itself incredibly seriously despite there being no reason to do so and it robs the movie of everything that made the first movie a guilty pleasure. The second film of the series took a few steps in the right direction (casting the Rock as the lead, bringing on Bruce Willis as the original Joe) but flushed any existing potential away with a dud plot and no sense of humor about it all. The movie only features two returning Joes from the first movie: Channing Tatum as Duke and Ray Park as Snake Eyes. Otherwise, we're given an entirely new team for their second mission. At the end of the first movie, we're shown that the American President has been replaced by master-of-disguise Zartan. As the second movie begins, Zartan has been living as the President for a while and the time has come for him to serve his role. As the President, he orders the G.I. Joes eliminated as terrorists while demolitions expert Firefly (Stevenson) frees Cobra Commander and Storm Shadow (Lee) from prison. The sole surviving Joes, Roadblock (Johnson), Lady Jaye (Palicki), and Flint (Cotrona), must rustle up any remaining allies and discover COBRA's plan before it's too late.Director John Chu and writers Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick decided we didn't need any of that fun of the movie's predecessor and did their best to bring us a ""serious"" G.I. Joe movie. This decision is flawed from the start because I just don't see there ever being a good, serious G.I. Joe film. The franchise is based on childhood fantasies: ninjas fighting alongside soldiers with big, crazy guns and hi-tech vehicles against an army of faceless villains lead by an evil mastermind and his team of equally insane companions. You just can't do a super-serious version of G.I. Joe because the premise appears, to me at least, to be inherently goofy. RETALIATION tries way too hard to be taken seriously despite being dumb. In fact, that's the only word that came to mind after the end credits began rolling when I first saw this movie: dumb. Dumb can be cool as long as it's fun enough to justify it, and this really isn't. The one-liners, the over-complicated COBRA scheme for world domination, the RZA being cast as a blind, elderly martial arts masterit's all fine for a movie who embraces it's campiness but doesn't sit well in a movie that tries to do it all with a straight-face. Crack a smile or somethinglet the audience know you're in on the joke, but don't try and convince me this is anything more than a joke.If this were the quality action movie it pretends to be, you know what it'd have: characters you care about and can get behind. Even RISE OF COBRA had some sort of character arc: as I remember, the first movie featured Duke trying to prove he was good enough to be a Joe and show himself the leader he believed himself to be. We had back-stories and character histories like the connection between Baroness, Duke, and Cobra Commander or the flashbacks about Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. In RETALIATION, we get throwaway lines about how Roadblock (Dwayne '""the Rock"" Johnson) doesn't feel ready for a command position or how Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) joined the military to prove something to her misogynist father but it doesn't stick and it's barely readdressed. And Flint (D.J. Cotrona) is nothing more than extra gun to follow them into battle. I didn't care about any of them. Snake Eyes remains the only cool character on the side of good, and that's pretty bad seeing as how Bruce Willis comes aboard as the original Joe, Joe Colton. He's even lazier here than he was in A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD. He mumbles lame one-liners and shows off a crazy- person level of armaments hidden in his suburban home. He has a running gag where he calls Lady Jaye ""Brenda"". Why is this supposed to be funny? And was the joke really expected to get such a laugh that it continues for the remainder of the movie? This is what constitutes as humor and the jokes only get worse from there.There is one element where RETALIATION excels and it's an important one: action. The action saves this movie from being total garbage. There's plenty of it and it's done with style. And the character design is a lot better in this movie. Well, one character in particular. I always thought Cobra Commander just looked weird in the first movie but he's here in all his glory this time around, proper face mask and all. All together, it's enough to bring G.I. JOE: RETALIATION to average, non-memorable levels as opposed to a death gargle for the franchise. It's not quite horrible but it's nothing to get excited about either.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
47,moviexclusive,"A forgettable sequel to a forgettable movie, this is one bland action blockbuster exercise in big guns and world destruction that even Dwayne Johnson cannot redeem",5,28 March 2013,"If Channing Tatum was the reason you loved 'GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra', we might as well give you the bad news that he dies very early in the film. That's a real shame in our opinion, even if his substitute Dwayne Johnson is an agreeable presence to be around for two hours. The chemistry between Tatum and Johnson in the film's opening few minutes is one of the few things that this loud-and-louder wham-bang exercise has going for it - in particular a scene in which both rib each other while playing a video game is easily the most personable moment in the film.Still, the fall of Tatum's Duke and the rise of Johnson's Roadblock is but one of the revisions that both Paramount and Hasbro felt were necessary to reinvigorate what was to them a mediocre box-office success relative to the dollars that any one of their 'Transformers' had made. Tatum isn't the only casualty; gone too is previous director Stephen Sommers, whose resume of 'The Mommy' apparently wasn't enough to make 'GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra' a satisfying enough box-office juggernaut, as well as its three writers – Stuart Beattie, David Elliot, and Paul Lovett – who have been accused by fans of not being in tune enough with the spirit of the franchise.In Sommers' place is Jon M. Chu, best known for the two 'Step Up' films and that Justin Bieber documentary. Little in his filmography suggests he might bring some flair to the material, and true enough, aside from a cool vertiginous ninja fight scene up in the Himalayas, Chu hardly betters Sommers' own workmanlike treatment. Undoubtedly the highlight of the entire film, that inspired sequence with flying ninjas is unfortunately too brief compared to the rest of the brain-numbing mayhem that we are made to endure, the majority of the film made up of frantic action that will leave you drained. It isn't just Chu's middling direction that leaves one disengaged; there is also the bland script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. Even if the story is no more than a narrative frame to give continuity to the non- stop destruction, that is little excuse for just how predictable it all gets – though we probably should not have expected more just by looking at how plainly the movie's poster separates the good guys from the bad ones. Probably worse than being trite is being callous, which describes how it takes significant real-world issues – like the political instability in Pakistan or the dangers of nuclear warfare – and turns them into live-action cartoon, especially evident in the way it hardly bats an eyelid after annihilating one of the major cities of the world.The only improvement the 'Zombieland' scribes bring to the table is some campy humour, which admittedly does help to enliven the otherwise deadening (pun intended) proceedings now and then. Most of these zingers are delivered with the right attitude by Johnson, whose square-jawed heroics are a perfect fit for the movie. Personifying how a G.I. doll would look like in real life and possessing the machismo of a model soldier, Johnson gets both the tongue-in-cheek parts and the 'hoorah' moments on the spot – so much so that he can even get away with rallying his fellow Joes by quoting Jay-Z like scripture.Speaking of cast, it is unfortunate that only one other actor manages to be as entertaining as Johnson. That unlikely candidate is Johnathan Pryce, who is clearly having a good time playing both the real President as well as his impostor. None of the other actors – especially not Johnson's teammates D.J. Cotrona and Adrianne Palicki – are much fun, and even the introduction of Bruce Willis late into the movie as the retired Joe founder doesn't bring much excitement except for a briefly amusing sequence that showcases his personal weapons arsenal in his very own home.All things considered, there are ultimately fewer bright sparks than dull sparks in this feeble attempt to inject more life into a franchise that was once meant to replace the 'Transformers' cash cow. Even as brainless summer blockbuster entertainment, it offers relentless action but little real thrills, coming off as a vacuous exercise in engineering destruction on a large scale for the sake of it. A Himalayan wire-ful action sequence and Dwayne Johnson do not a movie make, with little in this sequel justifying its ambition for having tried to be better than its predecessor. And if it isn't clear yet, then let us by categorical in stating that the additional dimension – for which the movie was apparently delayed nine months for – is but yet one more dimension of dullness.",G.I.

50,DJAkin,Much better than I was expecting,7,30 March 2013,"First of all, this movie had a beginning, middle and an end. A good movie needs all three elements to succeed. The Rock continues to deliver the goods as the premier action star. Shall we say for Vin Diesel to perhaps be in the next GI Joe? This movie had so much great action. I was shocked that the guy who played Darth Maul, Ray Park - was snakeeyes. He never spoke and you never saw his face. Also, the guy who played Stormshadow was amazing and could deflect bullets with his sword. I was surprised that the guy who played the mummy was in this movie. Why? I will tell you why. You could never see his face. They could have hired a no name actor to pull that off. The other actors were sort of amazing but nothing that will make me scream Oscars. The tank that the Rock drove was incredible and I liked how it could jump. I also liked how that blind wiseman in the mountains trained the GI Joes! He was correct when he said that your enemy will show no mercy. If you are fighting you must be aware of all of your surroundings. He trained his subjects well. I also liked that scene with all the ninjas scaling the mountainside. That was a great part of the movie. If you like suspense, action, violence and death, then THIS is the movie for you.

52,rivertam26,Death of the franchise,4,28 March 2013,"What I find funny is how much crap everyone is talking about the first film 2009's G.I. Joe Rise of the Cobra when that film was pretty darn entertaining, earned better reviews and opened to 54 million on it's way to over 300 million worldwide.Something I'm sure this entry won't even come close too. Of course Money a good film does not make. However, I can tell you this sequel/ reboot pails in comparison to it's predecessor. I wish I could tell you what this film is about because I'm still confused what I can tell you is that no one from the first film shows up for the sequel except for the sexy, charming Channing Tatum and than sadly only briefly. Marlon Wayans who was actually kinda funny for once, the gorgeous and kick ass Rachel Nichols as Scarlett and Joseph Gordon Levitt are disappointingly absent. And whether they tapped out or were replaced they lucked out cause the movie is pretty much a fail. Besides having much less of a storyline and only a little of the rambunctious charm of the original even the action set-pieces feel bland aside from an inspired mountain side sequence. The fight choreography is generic and unimpressive for the most part and all the intentional laughs from the implausibly bad dialog are dreadfully forced and there is too much of an abundance of the unintentional funnies. Not to say it doesn't have some genuinely good moments like at the beginning with Tatum wisecracking as usual or some so bad they are good moments such as sordid dramatic scenes and RZA showing up as a Kung fu Master. The performances are all pretty terrible The Rock who has a charm about him in other films is a little too hammy here and comes off a little unlikable, he definitely needs a better agent. Adrianne Palicki queen of flops from Legion and Red Dawn shows up in the films' most unsexy and worst performance as Lady Jaye, DJ Cotrona makes for decent eye candy as Flint, Bruce Willis hams it up sleepy style as in the latest Die Hard as the original Joe and Ray Stevenson is just kinda silly as Firefly. Director John Chu who I think has done well against many peoples opinions with the guilty pleasure step up sequels crashes big time here failing to find the right atmosphere or even an inkling of genuine suspense or intensity usually which make these movies more effective. This will without a doubt be the death of this franchise and thankfully so I'm not sure I could sit through another one fully and to be honest it's kind of put me off the genre for a bit. 2/5",G.I.

There's no point sugar-coating it; it was one of the worst films of last decade and if there was ever a blockbuster that didn't need a sequel, this was it. Yet as soon as I saw Dwayne Johnson in the trailer, it roped me back for more, and The Rock certainly doesn't disappoint. The most watchable and likable beefcake in Hollywood today bar none, Johnson single-handedly ensures Retaliation is worth the price of admission as the indefatigable platoon leader, codename Roadblock, who leads a small group of betrayed Joes on a revenge mission against the fake President of the U.S. It's not just the terrorist group Cobra that Johnson, Adrianne Palicki's Lady Jaye and D.J. Cotrona's Flint are battling against though; there's also the overly shaky camera work during action set-pieces, messy editing of close-combat fights and a fairly stupid plot they must contend with. But somehow there's enough working in its favour - a fantastically vertiginous cliffside showdown between samurai, a welcome cameo from the ever- smirking Bruce Willis, a nice line of humour throughout, and of course the man-mountain Johnson - to keep it on the right side of silly entertainment.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
54,chrichtonsworld,Ninja's are cool!,7,24 July 2013,"The sequel to GI JOE Rise of the Cobra has finally arrived. The trailer was full of promise but considering the first one was pretty much action all the way I wasn't expecting more from this. And yes if you liked the first chances are you will like the second one as well. Again it is all about stylish and cool action. Of which you get more than enough to see. Snake Eyes versus Storm Shadow remains one of the high points and is something that remains interesting in the larger plot. The larger plot is as simple as they come and not really surprising which could disappoint a few since the original had some story lines brewing that could have offered some nice twists and turns. That this hasn't happened is not a huge deal in my opinion. Come on who is looking for depth in a live action movie based on toys should do more research before hand. Honestly I read some comments on forums where people were expecting tales of Shakespearean caliber. Guys they blew up the Eiffel Tower and used super mech suits in the original,hardly something you can take that seriously. However this does not mean I am not critical. Because to be frank I was expecting much more from Bruce Willis. Is he even trying these days? He is basically playing the same roles not adding much than his famous smirk and almost tiresome bad assery. The Rock is always adequate and I can't really say anything bad about the guy. Adrienne Palecki holds her own as the pretty but tough girl amongst the guys which is nice. One complaint I might have is that the main villains are underused. It would have been more intriguing and threatening if they remained off screen than they way they appear in this one. GI Joe retaliation is definitely a fun action movie to watch. Even Miss Chofas who doesn't really like action movies like these and ninjas has warmed up to the genre and the guys in black pajama's. Now actor Lee Byung-hun who plays as Storm Shadow of course has a huge part in this and who can blame her. Besides it made me happy because I have been trying for a while now to explain to her how cool ninja's are. Now she finally gets it. Hip hip Hooray! So yeah overall G.I. Joe:Retaliation does what it is supposed to. Offer you blockbuster mayhem that is entertaining and fun.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
55,ketgup83,"A treat for all action-movie lovers. If you can ignore the script and direction , this one sure gonna blow your mind",7,31 July 2013,"I have always recommended people to watch different kind of films - whether it is Drama , Fantasy , Thriller , Comedy or action to get motivated , inspired or entertained. GI Joe : Retaliation falls into the later category which had mindless script and weak story but still has high content value to entertain and keep you engaged.GI Joe: Retaliation is a follow-up to 2009's GI Joe: Rise of Cobra in which they must start from the beginning after getting nearly destroyed by their prominent enemy Cobra.The highlight of the first film was stunning visual effects with some cool action stuff and this one leaves no stone unturned with better action sequences coupled with amazing gadgets. Direction by Jon M.Chu( Step up series) along with loose screenplay. The storyline is not-so- convincing. Apart from shortcomings , GI Joe still has the punch to carry on with highly-engaged mountain battle scene, the bike scene and the well-choreographed combat scene between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. Performances by Rock and Bruce Willis and Channing Tatum( small role) gives an edge to the film.Overall , a treat for all action-movie lovers. If you can ignore the script and direction , this one sure gonna blow your mind. Good 3/5",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
56,sarastro7,"Argh, so disappointing! Loved the first one, wanna forget this one.",4,31 March 2013,"I am a comic book collector, and love superheroes, although I never actually read the G.I. Joe comic. When the first movie came out, the reviews were so bad that I first decided not to see it, but a woman friend whose judgment I found reliable told me that it was very comic-book like and that I would probably like it. So I went anyway, and loved it. Last night I watched it for the fourth time, and it has me smiling and chuckling throughout! I enjoy it more every time I see it. It is very consciously high-camp, and its production values are precisely as slick and gorgeous as the recent Marvel Studios movies (Captain America, the Iron Men, The Avengers). I don't know exactly how much it references the comics, but I get a big kick out of the jokes that refer to action figures, like the mention of the kung fu grip, and ""Duke wasn't born; he was government issued!"" :-)But mostly, it's the characters. In the first movie there are many distinctive characters who are all very enjoyable. In the second movie the entire G.I. Joe outfit is reduced to three people (well, plus Snake Eyes), one of whom (Flint) is completely anonymous and has nothing to do! All the slickness and sci-fi coolness is just gone. The box office page here at IMDb claims that the sequel had an (estimated) budget of 135 million dollars; if that is the case, this is the cheapest-looking big-budget movie I have ever seen. It seemed like all the money was used on Bruce Willis (probably 20 mil just for him), the mountain side sequence and the urban blow-up, with nothing left to make anything else look good, nor to craft a coherent story. The big blow-up had zero consequences; we saw NO reactions at all! It wasn't even clear whether the Joes knew what was going on!In Retaliation, I found none of the characters compelling, with the partial exception of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow (whose survival from the first movie went unexplained - impaled and drowned; how did he live?!). Adrianne Palicki sure was eye-candy, but she didn't have that much to do. She could not compete with the amazing Rachel Nichols. I also missed Marlon Wayans. I am actually a big fan of Dwayne Johnson; he should have been to his generation what Stallone or Schwarzenegger were to theirs. But he has never succeeded in getting any properly great roles! He was pretty good in The Scorpion King, Walking Tall, and Doom, and I loved him in Be Cool, but besides those I have been bored and disappointed by virtually all his movies (still haven't seen Snitch, though). Not his fault; the fault of the projects he is offered. Sigh!There is this Hollywood rule of thumb that, if the execs believe a sequel can gross 60% of what the original did, then they greenlight it. To my eyes, it seems like they must be using a goddamn manual for creating a sequel which has *exactly* 60% of the budget, 60% of the plot quality, 60% of the acting, 60% of the entertainment value, and 60% of the visual effects. It just feels so utterly and unashamedly commercial. And in this case, more like 40%.Retaliation may have had more references to the comics, but the tone never felt anywhere near as inspirational and enthusiastic to me as in the first movie. But I must acknowledge that it did have some entertainment value. I liked the idea of the whole nuclear thing at the culminating summit (it was also effectively comical, for a bit), but I don't think it was played up to anywhere near its proper potential. So I'm sad. But grateful that we had *one* movie I can rave about.4 stars out of 10 for the sequel. 10 stars for the first movie.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
57,suite92,The action sequel to Rise of Cobra was quite a commercial success.,4,3 June 2014,"The current film is the sequel to GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009). Since the first film, Cobra Commander and Destro are in custody. Zartan has successfully impersonated the President of the US.The Joes get orders from the President to recover stolen nuclear weapons from Pakistan. The mission is successful, but someone kills the Pakistani head of state. This is pinned on Snake Eyes, and the whole mission is classified by the White House as the Joes going rogue. Where do they get off stealing nuclear weapons? The President orders that the Joes be sanctioned.Roadblock, Lady Jaye, and Flint survive the attack. Using secret channels, the trio reaches out to any other Joes. They make face-to-face contact with General Joe Colton, who founded the Joes.In an alternate thread, Storm Shadow and deadly ex-Joe Firefly spring Cobra Commander from the prison in Germany. Cobra Commander abandons Destro in the process, and Storm Shadow is badly wounded before they can exit. Storm Shadow retires to the Himalayas to recover. Snake Eyes and Jinx capture Storm Shadow and take him to Japan. Storm Shadow reveals that he only joined Cobra to get revenge on Zartan for killing his uncle.General Colton helps the remaining Joes get close to Zartan and get a DNA sample to prove he is not the President. With definitive proof, they prepare for more retaliatory action.Zartan (as the US President) calls a conference of world nuclear leaders. He tricks them into destroying all nuclear weapons, then shows them project Zeus, which allows Cobra to destroy whole cities with one shot. Cobra Commander arrives and demands rule of the entire world.Will the Joes be able to stop this plan and restore the legitimate President? Will they re-capture Cobra Commander? How many cities will be destroyed by the Zeus project? -----Scores-----Cinematography: 9/10 Shaky at times, but mostly excellent.Sound: 4/10 Bad sound leveling.Acting: 4/10 I liked the performances of Dwayne Johnson and Jonathan Pryce. Otherwise, not so much.Screenplay: 4/10 The segment where Zartan gets world leaders to fire huge numbers of nuclear missiles, then destroy them, was the most stupid version of 'Simon says' that I have ever seen. The lines written for Duke were indeed inappropriate, as Roadblock put it. The supposition that the public will accept anything is still a bit tough to take.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
58,Joxerlives,A real departure from what we've seen before,7,1 April 2013,"They certainly weren't afraid to shake things up a bit! Getting rid or at least not featuring almost the entire cast and characters from the first film was a bold move. As to whether they survived or not that remains something of a matter or conjecture, it's perfectly possible that General Hawk etc either survived the attack as Roadblock and co did or had left the organisation in the intervening years (and in Scarlet and Ripcord's case been off on maternity leave). So we have a new set of characters and solve the mystery behind who killed the Hard Master (although I'm still a little lost as to how exactly Storm Shadow figured that out and why he hadn't done so before?). The Good stuff? Lovely little cameo from Walter Goggins as the warden, he defies your expectations, you think he's the normal sadistic prison controller but actually he's heroic and extremely resourceful. Lady Jaye is gorgeous, you wish you'd seen more of her as Wonder Woman and the scene where Jinx and Snake-Eyes combine a Ninja movie with some extreme version of 'Cliffhanger' leaves you stunned. A little bit of political satire sneaked in there as well, the kidnapped president being 'waterboarded' and his imposter having record approval ratings from the public due to his habit of blowing stuff up. Also nice to see the proper Cobra Commander as we know him and great line 'Sorry Destro, you're out of the band'.The Bad? What they just sit there and let the Houses of Parliament get destroyed? How exactly does Cobra know that every nation will have a failsafe switch to destroy their missiles in flight? How is everyone able to retarget their missiles at the US within 4 minutes, especially nations like Britain who only have missiles aboard their submarines? Actually I'm going to stop there because the list of plot-holes is pretty much endless. Last but not least it feels like Bruce Willis is doing an extended cameo as a favour to one of the producers So part 3, yes definitely, I'd go to see it. Cobra Commander releases the Baroness and together they try to steal high-tech weapons from the US government using Major Bludd, the Dreadnoks and Zartan's family. Scarlet and Ripcord return from maternity leave to help rebuild the Joes and thwart them, uncovering Cobra's base in Springfield as they do. A complicating factor is Destro who was released from prison by the explosion and hires The Black Major and his mercenaries The Red Shadows who have a grudge against Cobra Commander who has betrayed them before. In the end Cobra retreat to their new base on Cobra Island to work on Serpentor whilst Destro examines some captured technology, technology based on certain giant transforming robots.",G.I.

59,ivo-cobra8,Why all the hate? A decent underrated action packed flick!,9,22 November 2015,"G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013) is very underrated part sequel & reboot to the semi-spectacular G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra. I seriously don't get the hate for this action packed flick. I have enjoyed this movie more than I did The Rise of Cobra. First off new actors were cast in here, new director and Duke (Channing Tatum) is killed off, which I am happy about it. The movie is good and is not bad, it does have action and it does have a story. I love the new actors in here like are: Dwayne Johnson, Bruce Willis, Adrianne Palicki, Byung-hun Lee, Ray Park. Seriously after reading the reviews this movie get's so much hate. I love this movie and it is way better than the first one was, it might does have a few plot holes, but which movies doesn't? Count me one movie, that does not have any plot holes or errors in it? Because everyone makes a mistake gosh. Some of the other more regular Joe's make their debut's such as Lady Jayne, Flint and Roadblock. Having Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Roadblock adds the extra muscle that lacked in the first Joe movie. The action is more realistic and grounded rather then slow-mo 360% moves that 'Rise of Cobra' featured. The addition of Bruce Willis plays more for cheap laughs but is fine for the scenes he is in. The plot unfolds and anyone who grew up with the cartoon pretty much knows the outcome. The action scenes were a blast. The Rock and Bruce Willis were great...Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow were kick ass...Cobra Commander looked like he should, and was bad ass...Love how they just said screw Destro and left him there, that was awesome...And I thought the Firefly character was interesting too...And Lady Jaye was hot...So...yeah...overall a way better movie then Rise Of Cobra...Was it the greatest action movie of all time? No! But still a decent, fun worthy sequel to look.The movie explained that Storm Shadow was framed and than he teamed with snake eyes that was awesome. Snake Eyes had much more to do in The Rise of Cobra here Storm shadow had more to do! Bruce Willis as baldy General Joe Colton did a wonderful job at acting. I seriously think he did a good job portraying his character. I wish they would made a sequel but they want. G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra wasn't the most faithful of old 80's animated adaptations and it was a bit over the top with to many slow-mo camera shots and less then stellar characterizations of the Joe's famed characters. Now enter Retaliation in which The Rock pumps up the action and we get Bruce Willis tossed into the mix towards the end along with Tatum Channing in for the ladies and part 2 feels more like a generic military movie which is full of action, but the other elements of plot are dubious. Bottom line it does play better then the first one, but this ""extended action cut"" feels dragged out rather than the tightly edited theatrical. Nonetheless it's a decent effort for a property that will die a slow death unless the proposed 3rd film goes for the gusto. Unlike Stephen Sommers, new director Jon M. Chu actually knows a thing or two about G.I. Joe and tries very hard to course-correct the franchise. He keeps the characters reasonably true to their comic book origins and loads the movie with familiar Iconography that fans will appreciate. Chu takes 'Retaliation' seriously as a G.I. Joe movie, and as an action movie in general. While the film will never be mistaken as deep or intellectual, most of the egregious stupidity that plagued 'Rise of Cobra' has been pared back here. The story is fair but the plotting is insignificant when it comes to the non-stop action set-pieces. The action scenes here, unlike the last movie, are more grounded, very well-choreographed and expertly-filmed without becoming incoherent and chaotic. While half of the action scenes come off as stylishly basic. There were some moments in the action that looked inventive, even inspired like a unique camera maneuver around Roadblock's tank in the finale for example. I don't hate CGI, but the near absent of phony CG makes the action look awesome. The best scene is an extended epic ninja battle on the Himalayan mountainsides, without any dialogue (which is a perfect decision from Chu and the writers). The casting this time around is good with some eye-rolling exceptions. overall I am giving this movie 9 out of 10, I would give it a 10, but thing is it always confused me how Storm Shadow was alive in here while he was killed off from Snake Eyes by the end of the movie in The Rise of the Cobra? first movie. I did enjoy this film as mindless entertainment: I laughed at some of the lines, I like some of the actors, The mountain scene alone made the film for me. Its not perfect but I can see it again with a commentary. There is nothing wrong with just some good old mindless fun that's how the cartoon was. Yo Joe!G.I.

63,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,A solid improvement over Rise of Cobra! Thumbs up!,8,31 March 2013,"I'm not exactly a fan of the GI Joe franchise, but I seemed to have found myself liking ""The Rise of Cobra"" aside from it's predictable storyline and uneven script and called it a guilty pleasure for me. So, I went to see this sequel on the opening weekend and it exceeded my expectations thereafter and delivered what the trailers had promised. It's not an excellent film by any means, but in my honest opinion, this is a great sequel and is much better than the previous installment despite the negative reception it received. I will admit, however, that there are some parts that got dragged and the beginning was way too rushed for my liking; and while most of the action sequences are thrilling thanks to Jon M. Chu's solid effort, some of them gave me a bit of a headache in it's shaky camera form.Flaws aside, everything else is perfect. The cast has improved a bit, but not that much. Channing Tatum's role as Duke has improved seeing as how he was beyond bland in the previous film and I liked his chemistry with Roadblock played by Dwayne Johnson who pulls off the role really well throughout the film. Bruce Willis steals the show as General Colton with his witty one-liners. The rest of the acting, however, ranges from OK to just forgettable.The directing from Jon M. Chu isn't perfect, but it's decent and a bit more focused on the story, which isn't exactly the best, but it's not as contrived as Rise of Cobra's plot. I kind of liked the idea of a nuclear missile that can destroy an entire city in the whole planet and it sort of leaves up for another sequel if it would get made. The script is very interesting and it has some nice plot twists. The editing is slick, the scenery is nice to look at, and the cinematography is great. Henry Jackman's music score is OK with some solid action cues, but most of the music is pretty obvious.Overall, GI Joe: Retaliation isn't an excellent, but like I said before, it's a much better installment to the franchise. To those who haven't seen it yet, I suggest that you should try. It is a good film worth recommending!",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

66,ersinkdotcom,"""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" tries to overcompensate for the mistakes made in ""The Rise of Cobra"" but comes up short",7,5 April 2013,"I've never been a big fan of ""G.I. Joe."" As a child, I would play with the original dolls which had the pull string on his back, poseable arms and legs, and real hair with a beard. Every version of the toy looked the same except that they'd give him a different uniform and hair color.When the ""G.I. Joe"" boom hit in the 1980s, I really wasn't too interested in army men with fancy weaponry. All my attention at the time was spent on ""Star Wars,"" ""Star Trek,"" ""Batman,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" and classic horror monsters. The whole franchise just didn't appeal to me.There were many fans upset by Stephen Sommers' first live-action entry in the ""G.I. Joe"" series. Some complained about the fact that the ""Real American Hero"" tagline was removed. Others felt the actors chosen for the parts were miscast. A few felt the movie relied on gadgets and CGI too much. Whatever the reasons were, director John M. Chu felt the need to make it up to the disappointed masses with ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation.""After Duke and his team of Joes are ambushed and left for dead, three survivors find themselves fugitives on the run. The President declares the group traitors for the assassination of a foreign government's leader. However, the President isn't who everyone thinks he is. Zartan, an evil minion of Cobra Commander, is disguised as the Commander-in- Chief through advanced technology.Cobra Commander plots to use Zartan's position to convince all foreign countries to throw down their nuclear arms. Little do they know his real plan is to have them disarm their missiles while he conquers the world with the use of a new kinetic weapon. It can do the same damage as a nuclear bomb but with none of the atomic fallout. Roadblock and the other survivors call upon the man who started the elite military team, Joe Colton, to foil Cobra's plans and clear their names.""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" will satisfy fans upset by ""The Rise of Cobra."" There's nowhere near as many cool gadgets as there were in the first film. It's not devoid of tricked-out weapons and vehicles, but it doesn't rely as heavily on them.Most of the action sequences are human-based versus bombs blowing things up and ships shooting at each other. I can understand why audiences want more interaction between real people and less CGI animation. However, there's just so many different ways you can run around shooting each other before it all starts to run together in the viewer's eyes.I found myself missing elements of the first film, such as the spectacular scene where Duke and Ripcord run through the streets of Paris in their cyber suits while Scarlett and Snake Eyes chase down the Baroness and Stormshadow in their SUV. The sequence where Snake Eyes and Jinx are battling Cobra ninjas on the side of a cliff in ""Retaliation"" comes close, but still didn't quite top it.There's also nothing in ""Retaliation"" that matches the visual eye-candy of the green clouds of nanotechnology devouring the Eiffel Tower and anything else in their path. The closest thing we get to that in this is a short scene of London being destroyed by a kinetic bomb and satellites blowing up.The casting for ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" is hit and miss. Dwayne Johnson plays the same character he always does, which is fine because he's always likable. He's not quite as humorous but gets the job done. Bruce Willis is great as Joe Colton, although he's only seen on screen for maybe twenty minutes. They could've done so much more with his role. I think it's pretty obvious why Adrianne Palicki was chosen to play Lady Jay. Guys love to look at her and she's adequate at playing a tough girl who's easy on the eyes.I doubt any blame can be directly laid on D.J. Cotrona, but the character of Flint was absolutely useless. I don't know why they didn't just keep Channing Tatum in the film or bring back Marlon Wayans as the comic relief, which is noticeably missing here. At least the role of Ripcord served some type of purpose in ""The Rise of Cobra.""I would love to find out what took Paramount so long to get this movie out. They reported that they wanted to do a proper job of converting it to 3D. Then word hit the internet that test audiences wanted more Channing Tatum and Dwayne Johnson interaction.First, I can't imagine what the 3D adds to the movie. I can usually tell when seeing a movie in 2D what would be highlighted in the 3D version and there wasn't much here. How long can it possibly take for a professional 3D transfer to be completed? I can't imagine it merits enough time to set a release date back almost a year.Secondly, anything extra they would've shot with Channing Tatum in it didn't add anything to the film in hindsight. If I were to make a guess, they shot the intro ""James Bond"" mission sequence for the beginning and a scene of the two actors playing a video game at Roadblock's house. There's no way the additional scenes could've taken any longer than two to three weeks to finish.When I see a big popcorn blockbuster sequel like this, I expect it to attempt to outdo its predecessor. That's not the case with ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation."" If anything, it's director John M. Chu overcompensating for what he thinks fans were disappointed with in ""The Rise of Cobra."" With all its flaws, I would still recommend it to moviegoers looking for something fun to watch on a Saturday afternoon. http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",G.I.

68,griffolyon12,A Spoiler-Free Review,5,10 November 2013,"The thing with G.I. Joe: Retaliation is not that it wont, at the very least, mildly entertain you, it is that the movie is very unfaithful in regards to its comic book and cartoon counterparts. While Retaliation is much better than its predecessor at upholding a slight glimmer of what made the comics and cartoons great, the movie spends too much time making jokes that aren't funny and taking itself far too seriously when it isn't. When the G.I. Joes are framed, they must go on the run to sort out who framed them and to save the day. Sure, there are a few cool action scenes here and there, but the unfunny humor, weak characterizations, and tonal shifts from overtly cartoonish to super serious on a dime, makes G.I. Joe: Retaliation not worth seeing unless you just really are dying to see some of your favorite G.I. Joe characters on the bigscreen.I give G.I. Joe: Retaliation a 5 out of 10!",G.I.

70,0w0,Not as flamboyant as the first film...,6,16 June 2020,"The first GI Joe movie was so hilariously unrealistic and just completely bat crazy, that it was really a good 'just stare at all the explosions and enjoy' movie... but unfortunately this 2nd film is much, much less flamboyant and much less of an extravagant affair... they also removed Sienna Miller and Joseph Gordon Levitt which is an obvious down-point.So overall, this film is much less of a spectacle than the first film, but the plot also isn't 'all over the place' and thus it has a better plot and story. So if you want your eyeballs bombarded by explosions and huge amounts of CGI, then rather watch the first film... but if you want a more structured 'action film experience' then this 2nd installment is better for you... both films are only barely 6/10 films though, and neither comes close to the action films greats like MI:Fallout.",G.I.

72,billygoat1071,Stale Explosions,5,30 March 2013,"G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra feels like it belongs to a different age of blockbusters. It had a hard time fitting in to the modern generation thus most moviegoers never find it as appealing as the other films that was released on that year. Those rants can be true only in some reasons. The film is undeniably silly and dumb but it was never boring and has its own quality. Since people are now asking for darker and much serious blockbusters, this sequel reduces all the silliness that was displayed on the original. G.I. Joe: Retaliation is cooler and less cartoony. Unfortunately, it is also less exciting and terribly uninspired. The action may be better looking but the lack of fortitude and creativity made it fall short into another visual showcase stress.""Awesome"" is the main goal of this sequel. While the original was too corny to impress, this film darkens the tone and made it a bit down to earth. It abandons the silly gadgets and the ridiculous laws of physics that was shown in the original. But the film fails to be both dark and realistic. Not only because of those robotic fireflies and the mass annihilating missiles but the secret prisons and the government are unbelievably dumb to manage their job. Well, it's a blockbuster based on toys so it will never be too realistic. Deal with it while we are here for the fun. The dark aspects aren't dark at all. What they only do is to be serious. This seriousness blocks the potential joy and turns it into standard blockbuster bland.The storytelling is quite messy. It's like an uninteresting version of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol with uninteresting characters. The storytelling from the first movie wasn't great either since it is cluttered with cheesy flashbacks. But it's worse here because it takes some twists that are absurdly incoherent. And so, it's all pretentious. The characters are boring and even the performances can't bring them to life. Dwayne Johnson is the only good thing among them though, Bruce Willis is trying to make fun of himself again as a crazy grandaddy, and the villains ham it up which isn't suppose to be a bad thing but they can't give enough personality to them.The action scenes are acceptable enough to call awesome at least. With all the explosions and the none CGI-ed machines, it seems to be really exciting, but it's not. It does a fine job to be pretty but there's a difference between good looking and exciting. There's only a little suspense. If there is actually suspense and joy then it would be found at the mountain ninja fight but it's just mild and still glosses some slow motions in it. For the rest of the action, the heroes are always superior. Plus more explosions and slow-mos. The action is stylishly directed anyway. The fight between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow remains to be the only action that excites and one part of the climax has a nutty scene with The Rock riding huge vehicles and shooting like a badass. The production designs, special effects, and costumes gets better. What else to talk about it?The absence of the Joes' ridiculous transportation and weapons, holograms, and other snazzy gadgets may please our modern viewers but it also forgets why this material is interesting anyway. Now we only get typical military stuff. It still has some crazy devices but it's limited compare to the first film. Rise of Cobra wasn't a classic. It's nothing more than a simple guilty pleasure. Same with Retaliation except this one can't even be completely pleasurable unless you want some endless visual coolness. Cool is not a bad thing but it could have been creative and much more exciting instead of showing off slow-mos on screen. To be fair, it's mildly entertaining and good to look at. If the film wasn't this visually awesome, it would have been an empty cinema. The series still fails to justify its source material.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
73,Al_The_Strange,"""Everybody wants to rule the world.""",6,26 April 2013,"In 2009, GI Joe hit the big screen with Rise of the Cobra. It would come to be loathed by both established fans and common viewers, seeing it as an overloaded, cartoony mess of a movie with absolutely no good justice done to the GI Joe franchise. I personally always knew this movie was bad, but it came to be one of my top guilty pleasures, thanks to its fantastically explosive and ambitious action sequences, its high-speed pacing, and overall lightheartedness, which makes it every bit as fun and endearing of an adventure as Stephen Sommers' other films.Now, like any other sequel, this new GI Joe film is released with the promise of making things ""better."" Jon Chau sets out to make GI Joe far less cartoony, far darker, and much more like an actual action movie, rather than whatever the heck Rise of the Cobra was. Retaliation still has some cool hardware; some of the most inventive scenes include an awesome morphing motorcycle, robotic fireflies, and a boat with tank treads. Some of the funnest action scenes include a high-flying pursuit along ziplines on a mountain, complete with ninjas, plus plenty of gunfights, swordfights, and explosive vehicular mayhem.This may all sound like great stuff for action fans. The problem is, the action is spaced out a lot more than in the first film, so the pacing suffers. Plus, most of the action is strangely drab and uninspired; the gunfights throughout the first half play out with little ambition or distinction, looking no different than any other action or war movie on the market. The real magic of GI Joe, with all the gizmos and cool fights, didn't sink in until the last half.Even with the action spread out, the story doesn't really take the time to breathe. It's strangely choppy; plot points are slapped together without any transition or sense of passage, so the logos of the whole thing is royally screwed up. Characters continue to make stupid decisions, and stupid events continue to take place (especially in the film's finale, which despite its ambition might be one of the most ridiculous things I've seen in a while). Characterization is mostly absent, and actually felt stronger in the first film. Overall, this is not the film to see if you want a quality story, much less one that makes sense or has actual depth or feeling.This film is made with adequate photography; there are plenty of cool-looking shots, but most fights are shot really close and with some erratic shaking, making it a little annoying to watch half of the time. Editing is good on a shot-by-shot basis, but the cutting of the scenes is too screwy to make the film work. Acting from the main cast is pretty bland, and I was especially mortified by the RZA's acting in his cameo appearance. Writing is awful, with really stupid dialogue and terrible plotting. The best that can be said is that this production uses okay-looking sets, props, costumes, and Henry Jackman's score is awesome at times.GI Joe: Retaliation has its exciting parts, but it's brought down tremendously by its lackluster characters, its hole-ridden plot, and mediocre execution. I'd even go so far as to say that it lacks the ambition of Rise of the Cobra; I'll always go back to that first film, even with its own set of horrid issues, just to experience the awesome Paris car chase, the sub-glacial submarine battle, and every other awesome thing Stephen Sommers could come up with. By comparison, Jon Chau's film is far less fun, even when it tries so hard to be cool.If I'd recommend this to anybody, it would probably be to younger PG-13 crowd, who would go to this for the action rather than the story anyway. Die-hard franchise fans will probably dig it too. Most everybody else will probably find it disgusting.3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Marginal | Film: Marginal)",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

75,lagudafuad,what a load of crap,3,2 April 2013,"Starts in the path of mediocrity, takes you down the valley of stupidity, makes you think there is more to this disjointed story, and then fools you to believe the cast is more than it seems; then when you think you have had enough, it drops you down the hole of impossibility and leaves you with one question ""Could this movie be any worse?"" Sadly it was. Here is a sorry excuse for a movie based on the Hasbro's toy series ""The G.I Joe"", I actually felt the first G.I Joe movie The Rise of Cobra was over rated, but then I see this one and I think the first should have been given more respect than it got. The acting was crappy the disjointed stories felt like they will never meet and when they finally do, I ended up wishing they didn't. Bruce Willis is in this movie for a reason I don't quite understand, and then Dwayne Johnson is also added, all this to me is just to boost sales. I'm saying the truth don't let the posters fool you Bruce Willis had little to nothing to do in this film.Some of the old cast members from the first movie were called back; they include Channing Tatum, Arnold Vosloo, Ray Park, Jonathan Pryce, and Lee Byung-hun all reprising their roles from the first film.The brief summary of the plot has our Joes up against their old enemy Cobra but this time he seems to be smarter Cobra found a way (while imprisoned) to infiltrate the United States presidency. He did this by having the president kidnapped and replacing him with Zartan. Now Zartan is now the new president of the United Utates and he ordered an air strike to kill off the Joes. After major casualties only Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) survived and they decided to get their revenge.Meanwhile the Arashikage clan sent Snake Eyes (Ray Park) to go capture the renegade Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) to answer for the death of his uncle.Somehow these two stories intertwine and at the end the good guys win, nothing special about that.This movie is just full of fast paced action scenes that don't leave behind enough juice for you to value them (there is no lasting impression).If you have enough spare time in your hands, I advise you catch up on some sleep and forget seeing this movie www.lagsreviews.com",G.I.

76,p-jonsson,"A great gadget, action, martial arts and explosions feast",9,2 August 2013,"This movie is all about action, gadgets, martial arts and explosions, lots of explosions. It has no pretensions whatsoever about being a deep movie, requiring or inspiring some thinking from on the viewer's part or having an elaborate plot. This movie is all about entertaining the intended audience with a roller coaster ride of gadget filled fighting, shooting and blowing things up style of action. As far as that objective goes it is ""mission accomplished"" with flying colors.The story is nothing fantastical but I have seen far far worse. It does hold together pretty well and it does serve as a decent enough foundation for stringing all the action scenes together. The gadgetry is generally quite cool but at the same time the movie is not all gadgets. There is plenty of old fashioned martial arts fighting as well as plain guns a' la ""shot first, shot later and then shot some more"". The special effects are more than decent as well.I did like Dwayne Johnson in the role of ""Roadblock"". It is not exactly Shakespeare material but I think he fits this particular role quite well. I also liked Bruce Willis as General Joe Colton. He did not show up until the second half of the movie but I quite liked it when he did. The scene where he starts to reveal his hidden weapons caches in his house is almost hilarious. At first I thought okay, a few guns, what are they going to do with that little inventory but then he just went on and on and on. It was quite fun.To me, watching this movie was simply loads of fun. It is just the way I think an adaptation of a toy hero/comic book type of character or story should be done. Simple and action-filled. No silly character introspection, insecure heroes, feeling of guilt or screwed up romances. The heroes are heroes and the bad guys are bad guys (okay with one exception that confirms the rule) and that is it.I hope they make a third one in the same style.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
77,Magow-Intermean,G.I. Joe: Retaliation Review,7,30 March 2019,"A Cobra member posing as the President has infiltrated the White House. When he orders the obliteration of the G.I. Joes only a few survive and it's up to Roadblock (Johnson) and a small team to expose the Cobra conspiracy and save the world.
When you're making a film based on 4""-tall bits of plastic there's no duty to produce a piece of lasting cinema or redefine the landscape. Nobody's comparing anything to any Oscar winners here. It just needs, in keeping with its source, a high degree of simple fun. Mindless as you like, but a feeling of being a little more uplifted on leaving than you were when you arrived. G.I. Joe: Retaliation, more so than its dead-eyed predecessor, wears the lightness of its premise like a lead vest.It is expected that you were paying attention last time around because this sequel picks up right where the last flopped to a halt. The highest office in the world has been taken over by Cobra, a cabal of badness, with an evil doppelganger replacing the US president. In turn, the G.I. Joes have captured Cobra's two highest-ranking members, Destro (the one with the silver face) and Cobra Commander (the one with only bits of a face, those bits no longer played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt). The other Joes we'd come to vaguely remember have been hastily erased, replaced with some equally forgettable sundries and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. Johnson is expected to resurrect the series but it's too much heavy lifting even for his considerable muscle.Retaliation over-promises and under-delivers. We are introduced to Johnson's 'Roadblock' as he pals around with Channing Tatum, the only major holdover from the first film. They're given a lot of ugly dialogue to work around but they're a fun pair; an action buddy comedy with them would pass happily. But Tatum exits quickly and then it's Johnson alone, being morose. Johnson's a terrific blockbuster actor, but he needs a foil and he needs laughs. So later we get Bruce Willis as the original Joe and another chance for sparky buddy comedy. And again, Willis spends barely any time on screen. It's an odd choice to repeatedly remind the audience how much fun things could have been.Chu's direction is lifeless. He draws nothing from his cast and his action sequences are confused and flailing. But it's the lack of joy that's bizarre. The first film you could at least laugh at. This takes all its silly ingredients and smushes them down flat.Fast Five was a good example of how applying The Rock to a tired series could bring it back to life. G.I. Joe, by opting for self-seriousness instead of knowing daftness, has squandered its secret weapon.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
78,xamtaro,The guy who made the Justin Bieber movie is out of his element,6,31 March 2013,"In the near future, a crack unit of anti-terrorism specialists are framed for a crime they did not commit. A few of them promptly escape from a devastating counterattack and flee back to Washington. Still wanted fugitives under the order of the President, the remaining G I Joes must uncover the truth and clear their name. Yes there are similarities to the premise of ""The Losers"" and ""A-Team"" but G I Joe Retaliation heaps in that familiar premise with a good dose of comic book action and blockbuster thrills. However, it's loyalty to the G I Joe comic books cannot make us overlook the convoluted narrative, bland characters and overall inappropriate directing style.If G I Joe: Rise of Cobra captured the spirit of the cheesy 80s era Saturday morning cartoon, G I Joe Retaliation oozes with the feel of the grittier G I Joe comic books written by Larry Hama. The tone from the get go is one of desperation and tension. The stakes are high and there is little chance of the good guys winning, yet they will pull it off somehow. Sadly, that is not necessarily a good thing. Hama was enamored with his ninja characters and it shows here in the movie. Cutting between the Joes trying to clear their name and the ninjas on their quest to the Himalayas is like cutting between 2 very different movies.Only the most hardcore of G I Joe comic fans will ""get it"". The film is littered with references to the comics (such as the Blind Master of Arashikage Clan, the look of Cobra Commander, etc) that will be lost on normal audience. Furthermore, this movie feels less like a sequel and more like a reboot of the franchise. How did Cobra turn into this vast underground terror organization after it was obliterated in the first movie? Why does everyone acknowledge Cobra Commander as supreme leader when in the first movie he only declares himself as ""Commander"" to one person (who aside from a brief cameo, never has an active role in this movie).While the story is a bit of a mess, the screenplay by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (writers of Zombieland) is very well written, mixing the occasional humor with down to earth banter that fits each character's personality. Dwayne Johnson works best with their script as his character of Roadblock shares such a marvelous chemistry with Channing Tatum's Duke. Jonathan Pryce shines as well playing both the President and his impostor. Sadly, the rest of the cast do not seem as invested in the story as the main leads. The bad guys seem underwhelming, the new G I Joe members Flint and Lady Jaye are overshadowed by Dwayne Johnson's screen presence and Bruce Willis is barely there. All in all, it was a good script handled badly. The narrative suffers the same fate; it has some good underlying political themes about America's international presence, attitude toward foreign intervention and nuclear disarmament. Yet these are only touch and go, never elaborated on or even satired. A little more ""brains"" in this blockbuster could have scored it more points.""Step Up"" director Jon Chu seems out of his element directing a big action blockbuster. You got some cool visuals here but Jon Chu shoots them too tight and his camera-work too frantic for any of the action to shine. At least Stephan Sommers had a good grasp on how to showcase big action scenes with a good mix of wide angles and long shots. Chu loses them in blurry close ups of shoulders, elbows, and everything BUT the full action. Could it be a case of a director who is out of his element? He takes the screenplay and gives it such lousy pacing laced with a good measure of exposition. The dialogue heavy scenes seem long and drawn out. Convenient plot twists abound and one particular character has a logic defying switch of allegiance.Tone wise, the film can never seem to decide if it is going for a more realistic feel or comic book action. You have high flying stunts on a cliffside, bullet time shootouts, over the top villainous plots to blow up cities and rule the world, high octane vehicle combat, but at the same time you have scenes of characters just shooting at each other from cover like soldiers do in real life. The ninjas got this whole ""realistic touch"" thing the worst. After a spectacular deflect-the-shurikens-with-bullets scene, the ninjas Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow proceed to........wrestle each other. Thats right, no kung fu, no high flying kicks or lightning fast fist cuffs.In the end, G I Joe Retaliation comes across as an overindulgent piece of fan fiction. The creative team seems more obsessed with sticking as close to the visuals of the comic books than to give a deep, character driven narrative. Whichever ""genius"" got a director best known for street dancing movies and that Justin Bieber biopic to come and direct a big budget action blockbuster ought to be fired. Fans will no doubt be willing to overlook all the flaws on the single notion that it adheres closely to the source material these fans have come to love.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
79,daisukereds,Hard time distinguishing this from a the human-side of a Transformers movie,2,16 March 2021,"What made the first one really good, isn't here.. As a sequel, it's even worse.The problem is two-fold. From a simplistic script to a charmless cast.
Adding the Rock changes it's direction dramatically, RZA always talentless, Goggins has never done someone as annoying, and the rookies ""flint"" and ""mouse"" are forgettable. Even Bruce Willis is bland.The dialogue is WAY worse, pointless and most scenes can be skipped. Talking about ""conversational fillers"" in a GI Joe movie? And instead of a grandiose plot (as if kids were playing with toys making up nonsense), we got a meandering and generic spy movie script.The action is a tad below serviceable. And sequences leave a lot to desire... How can you cut away from Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes fighting, to an old woman?
Sure the mountain scene is creative, but you don't have the best Joe against common enemies.. It's boring.From destructive nanotechnology and modified-soldiers back to Nuclear weapons and regular people. From an undersea Fortress and submarine battles, to a couple of guys and boats at a War Museum. While the Nuclear Disarmament scene was a very interesting idea and execution (although unrealistic), it is in the wrong movie.

80,kgprophet,Where is the fun?,4,28 March 2013,"This film in no way, shape, or form resembles the first ""G.I. Joe"" film. This is a Hasbro product. Hasbro is a toy company. What the first film had was set piece after set piece of nifty gadgets - toys - that induced a lot of action. This film makes the mistake that the first ""Mission: Impossible"" film did. It killed off the supporting crew, which killed the fun.Whether it was by design or necessity, almost no members of the original cast return. The new crew is not given any lively activities to do. The action quotient is far far less in this film, along with absolutely no James Bondish toys (just lots of guns). No underwater battles, no super-powered exoskeletons, no gigantic underground secret military base, no swooping attack aircraft. There are just these nano insects, but that belongs to the bad guys.Gone also in the script is any sense of fun. This is not well paced and the setup is not very interesting. Just as Die-hard 5 was really a Bruce Willis action vehicle, this film really is a Dwayne Johnson action vehicle, not a G.I. Joe film. Oh, and forget about having any fun watching Willis, he is not really in this film. Neither is Channing Tatum. Oddly, the best performance comes from Jonathan Price, who dons the villain role once he resembles the President. The only memorable action sequence was an inventive set piece that literally is a cliffhanger. The good guys and bad guys are hanging off the side of a cliff on long ropes, swinging horizontally side to side as they attack each other. The best holdover is the rivalry between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. Their fight sequences thankfully show some inventiveness as well.Which brings up the tone of the film in general. Dwayne Johnson's 'Roadblock' does not have any heightened skills in martial arts or anything, he's just a big tough guy. Then there are the pretty sidekicks, who show no flair in fighting skills. The first film had this superhero version of reality where slick gadgets and physically impossible stunts sequences dazzled the screen. I eventually became bored with ""G.I. Joe 2"". Budget certainly seems lower on this compared to the original. Whether it was by necessity or design, the lack of fun toys and inventive action causes the runtime to feel long, even though it clocks in at less than two hours. Then there is the 3D conversion. These days the 3D post-production technique works just fine. But there is very little justify viewing it with that extra dimension, compared to say ""Oz the Great & Powerful"". Most of the film is grimy and you aren't whisked around to exotic locations (save for the cliffhanger sequence). What effects there are are competent, as well as the lensing and sound. The script may be one of the ultimate faults, killing off the fun and having little lively dialogue.Hopefully audiences will recognise the mediocrity and put the franchise to bed.",G.I.

Starting off, Dwayne The Rock Johnson does his part like he does in every movie he acts in, action packed buffed guy who acts the typical ""American hero"" role. Further on we are presented with some of the best visuals I have ever seen in a movie and this is where the movie got a whole lot different for me, especially the fighting scene in the mountains that lasted quite long (it is obvious why it fills 80% of the movie's trailer). That scene was so well made and filmed that it took my breath away, but also, the visual effects that made London looking like it's really going to perish after the nuke went down. The biggest negative was the fact that people who do not know the prequel would get lost in the plot pretty easy, but also the ""bait"" that the movie made with the apperance of Bruce Willis who we barely saw in the movie, up to 10 minutes at most.",G.I.

Joe: Retaliation"" is just a series of explosions, gun battles and sword fights briefly interspersed with a theme about nuclear disarmament and a couple of scenes with Channing Tatum (""21 Jump Street"") and Bruce Willis, who, although is 10 times more entertaining than he was in ""A Good Day to Die Hard,"" cannot save this enterprise. Likewise, neither can the presence of a genuine actor, Jonathan Pryce (""The Brothers Grimm""), in a double role as the U.S. president and an impostor to the office.The ""plot"" has the elite commando ""Joe"" unit preventing a nuclear meltdown after the president of Pakistan is assassinated, but find themselves betrayed and almost wiped out by their own government.

Cotrona, ""Dear John""), somehow make it back to the states, are hidden by an Ice-T clone, meet retired General Joe Colton (Willis) and plan their revenge. Meanwhile, something is going on in a monastery in Tibet having to do with Snake Eyes (Ray Park, ""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever"") and Jinx (Elodie Yung, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"") trying to stuff Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee, ""I Saw the Devil"") into a bag. These mountain conflicts with a seemingly endless stream of Ninjas were impressive, but amazingly disengaged, almost as if director Jon Chu (the last two ""Step Up"" movies) just pointed the camera at the cast of another movie and then went on vacation.As this is going on, we get a few tantalizing sequences with Jonathan Pryce gloriously chewing the White House scenery, insulting North Korea (hey, who could resist?) and blowing up London on a whim. As previously alluded to, his inclusion does not salvage this effort, but does make it go down — somewhat — easier.There are other elements to G.I. Joe: Retaliation, but none make it any better: Firefly (Ray Stevenson, ""Thor"") cracks wise and releases explosive bugs, Roadblock gets to take on the U.S. Army in a dune buggy/tank contraption, Zartan (Arnold Vosloo, ""Blood Diamond"") does his best Darth Vader impersonation and Walton Goggins (""Django Unchained"") as the smug warden gets his comeuppance.Mainly, though, G.I. Joe: Retaliation is just a 12-year-old boy's violence fantasy adventure with enough epilepsy-producing struggles that the identification of good guys and villains is reduced to simply hazarding a guess. Those familiar with ""Snake Eyes,"" ""Storm Shadow,"" ""Lady Jaye,"" ""Roadblock,"" ""Jinx,"" ""Zartan,"" ""Firefly"" and others may not have such a problem due to their closeness and affection for the characters, but to others like myself who could not care less, interpreting the differences is far too much of an effort to devote.",G.I.

87,trokanmariel-17760,A sexual entity,10,16 October 2021,"It isn't philosophical, but, what I take away from GI Joe Retaliation that can be more than just entertainment is the access to each subsequent scene, as a chronology.

88,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Repeat the G.I.Joe Fun!!,6,13 April 2014,"G.I. Joe 2. I liked it better than the first one just because of the presence of action masters like Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis. This time stakes are much higher but you will never feel the urgency. Actions scenes are done quite well especially the ninja battle in the mountains. Like any run of the mill action movie, there are few delicious one liners and team members loving or hating each other for different reasons. Like the first one production values are high enough to keep you glued to the screen but you never take the movie too seriously even if its characters are serious about their mission. Acting wise, no one stands out and not having a very cunning strong villain hurts. I am going with not bad 6 out of 10 for G.I. Joe: Retaliation. You might not remember it after finishing but you won't complain during its run time.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
89,jfarms1956,"GI Joe Retaliation is a film geared primarily for the male testosterone film addicts and for those who love blow-them-up, kung fu movies.",7,15 January 2014,"GI Joe Retaliation is a film geared primarily for the male testosterone film addicts and for those who love blow-them-up, kung fu movies. It is an action packed movie right from the start. The mountain fighting scenes are incredible. Kung Fu 5+ miles high is a real attention holder. The action in this movie never stops. I love the next to last scene between the two big fighters. It is an interesting twist of fate for one of them. Bruce Willis and Dwayne Johnson were the big stars in this film. It is not a good socializing film because one is too wrapped up into the constant action to socialize and to interact with each other. The film reminds me of the war like video games vetting superhero against super villain. No popcorn here, too much action. Enjoy.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
90,helmutty,A more serious and darker sequel,8,29 March 2013,"The first installment is big, loud, colorful and loads of CGI set pieces. However, the sequel which is obviously made with a lower budget, is more grounded in reality. But it is forgivable due to its action-packed plot and some well crafted action scenes. It does not have the fantasy and fluff look of G.I Joe: Rise of Cobra but it has its fair share of cool gadgets.The story: This, like the one first one, is action-packed from the start to the end. This is noticeably more intense and thrilling than the first one and it may be due to its grounded action. The story is straight-forward with the remaining G.I Joes stopping Commander Cobra from ruling the world. There are some action scenes worth noting such as the fight scene on the mountains. It is thrilling as you see the two sides clashing with each other. What the action scenes lack is the over-the-top zaniness action from the first one. Acting wise is okay for an action movie. Music is okay but not as good as the first one.Overall: Those who enjoyed the first one may be disappointed with the sequel as it does not have what the first one has; over-the-top action. I seem to enjoy this better as it is more thrilling than the first. Rise of Cobra is more like a cartoon, it does not really have a sense of dread. I hope to see another sequel.",G.I.

92,kunalkhandwala,Still no resemblance to the cartoon series,6,10 April 2013,"Cobra Commander's plans of world domination were set in motion even upon his capture in 'Rise of Cobra', three years ago. While the film was more of a sci-fi tech-fest than a tribute to the epic cartoon series of good v/s evil, hope remained with news of its sequel based on Cobra's retaliation upon the Joes. Directed by a certain Chu who previously made a film about Justin Bieber, G.I. Joe: Retaliation is action packed, mostly inane, over-the-top mayhem that is a far-cry from what you grew up playing with and watching. As martial law comes into effect in a war torn Pakistan, the U.S. Commander in Chief orders the G.I. Joe team to seize the country's nuclear weapons, lest they fall into wrong hands. Duke (Channing Tatum), Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye, Flint and others complete the mission, only to be attacked ruthlessly by their own country's forces. A distraught Roadblock leads the remainder of the team after Duke's fall and suspects the President's real identity being the cause of losses. His inhibitions are just since Zartan, the master of disguise, has hidden the real President and has seized control of the most powerful nation with the aid of some facial nanotechnology. Meanwhile, Storm Shadow infiltrates a maximum security prison and aided by Firefly, releases the Cobra Commander from captivity. Shadow is terribly burnt in this operation and is sent to the Himalayas for recovery while Cobra seizes control of the White House with Zartan and dictates rigid terms to the world's nuclear powers, while deriding North Korea's boy leader. In that process, we witness a spectacular annihilation of London that far surpasses the fall of the Eiffel Tower in the previous film. In the middle of such intense proceedings, an intentional story diversion brings Snake Eyes and Jinx to the astoundingly inaccessible monastery in the Himalayas (British Columbia), where they are to kidnap Storm Shadow..... in a bag. The ninja sword fight along the snowy mountain side with characters swinging along zip lines and running perpendicular to the mountain side is a jaw-dropping sequence. This will be a tough act to follow for the numerous action flicks lined up in future. On the other side, Roadblock meets General Joe Colton (Bruce Willis), whose cozy home is merely a disguise to an enormous weapons warehouse and together with Storm Shadow's help, the Joes fight to save the day from Cobra's plans of world domination. Soon, they've managed to kill most of the Cobra villains in retaliation to their Joe brothers being killed earlier. Therein lies the film's biggest flaw. The director may intend to depict a grown up version of the series but its essence is in the ability of Cobra's forces to escape from G.I. Joe's clutches every single time. While it was frustrating, this was the one big draw for audiences every weekend to tune in to the next episode. Do we now have to eagerly await the next sequel without Duke, Firefly, Zartan and The Baroness? While following up to the 'Rise of Cobra' with more guns and swords action, Chu also throws some Transformers type machines including an explosive disassembling motorbike, suicide nanotech fireflies and missile launching satellites. Even less convincing are the performances of the characters from whom we expected much more. Flinch has been completely wasted, while Storm Shadow gets the fast paced mortal combat that includes slicing a bullet with a sword. Jonathan Pryce plays the fake and real President convincingly while Lady Jaye digresses from the original character by becoming mere eye candy in the film. Dwayne Johnson looks like a soldier on a mission to save the world whom you don't want to shoot at but he maintains a Rock solid face throughout the movie that will only typecast him in such roles. Not that there is anything wrong with the franchises he is working on....'Retaliation' is thus a G.I. Joe action adventure that has a lot going on and much of it isn't coherent but that was expected from its director. Confrontations between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow are exciting and the mountain side Ninja fight is awe inspiring. A few more action sequences such as Cobra Commander's escape meet some expectations but in the end, with its flawed characters, storyline and non-resemblance to the cartoon series, Chu misses the opportunity to revive this franchise by giving us something we can relate to. Remember.... sometimes, familiarity draws success.6.32 on a scale of 1-10.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
93,achyutaghosh,G.I.Joe: Retaliation movie review- ridiculous and lovely!,7,29 March 2013,"The good- GI Joe Retaliation is infinitely bigger, louder and thankfully so- better than its predecessor. Breath-taking, non stop action, great VFX, deadpan heroes and femme fatals , great soundtrack and gizmo's that will shame 007, it ticks most of the boxes for a summer action flick. The bad- not that the leads are great actors, but back to back to back action set pieces leave little room for acting, the dialogs are as banal as they can get, and the climax is cartoonishly over the top.Retaliation takes off from where Rise of Cobra ended, and the movie is best enjoyed by folks versed in the Joes legend - the President of the US has been replaced by Zartan aided with some cool nanomite wizardry. The time-line is a mix of alternate and real history- Pakistan is a failed state and the Joes are sent to retrieve the country's nuclear arsenal. But it is a trap- the President is after all a Cobra operative, and he wipes out the entire GI Joe force including the hero from the previous film Duke (Channing Tatum), except for the intrepid trio of Roadblock (The Rock- Dwayne Johnson) , Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Flint (D J Cotrona). It is up to these three along with the original Joe, Bruce Willis to expose the fraud president and prevent global annihilation.GI Joe action figures gained popularity in the mid 80s, when the world was falling at the feet of Japan- economic hatchbacks, Walkman, ninjas, VCR et all-action movies in the 80s paid homage to Japan (anyone remember Robocop 3?). The Japanese angle in GI Joe is Snake Eyes, Jinx and Storm Shadow- together they deliver one of the finest one on one sword fight in a monastery, and then director Jon Chu goes one step better to give your ticket worth price 3D action sequence in snow capped Himalayan territory when Snake Eyes and Jinyx escape from a platoon of ninjas whooshing between peaks, rappelling sheer cliffs, braving avalanches, gunfire and swords. The trailer features some of this out of the word stunt-work, but the full experience of this in the movie is amazing, so much so that after this, the other Joes do not matter anymore- its Snake Eyes that your eyes will follow, and i think it is about time he got his solo movie- he is cool enough! I was happy to see Dwayne Johnson return to his roots- the Rock always adds class to any role he takes on, he has his family audience fans, but he is first and foremost an action star, with a sweet core. Jonathan Pryce as the President is delightfully funny as a villain reveling in his new found power and Bruce Willis totes his own brand of hairless machismo. This is Hasbro's third live adaption of its action figures/toys- after Transformers and Battleships. So if you are above 12, it will feel ridiculous, funny and overblown. Characters do not have names, just tags. Things get blown up big, and there is a villain thirsting for ""world dominion"". This is not mature and contemplative graphic novel adaptation- this is the cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac meal, the ultimate junk food, and like the Mac meal it gives the kick and leaves a sweet feeling too . I grew up on comic books and action figures, and perhaps the greatest kick I get out of these kind of movies is the magical transport back to childhood. For guts and for glory, for guns and for action, for setting the summer of 2013 on fire - 7/10. Boo-ya-ah!",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
94,jace_the_film_guy,Should Never Have Been Made,3,29 July 2021,"GI Joe: Retaliation is a film that should never have been made. When most of the original cast declined to return for this second installment, the studio panicked and did the only logical thing: bring in The Rock. The problem with this response to an already broken franchise is that it disconnected the audience from the characters. If Jaye was Scarlett, Roadblock was Ripcord and General Joe was General Hawk, we would be looking at a completely different film, one that probably would have been more successful.Unfortunately, I had no vested interest in the story or the climactic ""Project Zeus"" because of these flaws. The action sequences (especially the Himalayan cliffside battle) were fantastic, but that was not enough to make me actually care about what happened in the end.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
95,Mike-DD,Don't bring expectations - just enjoy it,7,16 March 2014,"You can bring *some* expectations - gun fights, explosions, intrigue, etc. And the movie does provide enough excitement and diabolical machinations to pique my interest and continue engaging me in the story.One reason I really wanted to see this movie was the confrontation between Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes. Though it was short, it was really fun - Snake Eyes really knows how to use a gun, not to attack, but to defend. And the ensuing escape from the mountain where this happened is one of the more innovative and breathtaking escape scenes I've seen on screen. To me, it's worth half the ticket price simply for that scene.Most of the rest of the movie is decently shot. You will see one or two beautifully-shot Roland-Emmerich inspired destruction scenes. There are the pretty standard fight scenes, and there are the standard incredible one-wins-against-many and old-beats-new-technology battle scenes.The weapon technologies employed were a bit sucky, I thought. The ultimate weapon was a bit too... pedestrian. And it just seemed too easy to be able to launch nuclear strikes - with just the press of a button? And just as easy to self-destruct? And that override button - really really doing much more than it's supposed to, one would think. But they're easily ignored - the plot moves fast enough to not let you think too long or much, and to ignore all the other improbabilities that occur.In the end, this is an enjoyable action movie. Don't expect too much cerebral involvement and you'll be able to take away what's meant to be taken away - a fun time watching people fight and blowing up things and places.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
96,Der_Schnibbler,"Just ""lol""",1,8 July 2013,"Okay, so slagging this movie is somewhat tantamount to stomping a homeless bum in the face. No one is going to give you hero points for attacking what is already useless. However, I decided to make a comment about it 'cause it did manage to entertain with its incredibly capacity for distinctly American stupidity.In this film, Americans ""rule the world"" (as was indirectly implied). The male cast consists of neckless, square-jawed UFC types. It quotes moron rappers. Its full of special effects and zero plot. Oh, and let's not forget the requisite political correct fantasy world that is the obsession of the extremist liberal leftist commie Jews who make these big budget films. And so we have the obligatory ambiguously caucasoid dark-skinned ""hot"" female, who is also in the military (nevermind that all military women are ugly, low class dykes), enlisted precisely 'cause her daddy (or whoever the hell it was) told her she wasn't good enough to enlist 'cause she's a girl (""I is a girl! I can be's a man too!""), and so as not to leave anyone out in our little commie utopia that is the politically correct American landscape of today, we have at least one Asian guy.Another impossible to ignore aspect of this film--which will undoubtedly fly right over the heads of ignorant, belligerent, beer-swilling, dope- smoking American degenerates, whose mediocre high school education does not equip them with any analytical skills surpassing those of an ant--is its very title. A military strikeback. It's just the Hollyjews feeding into the American frenzy about imaginary terrorists blah blah blah, which in turn makes the pacified American sheep, dumbed down on weed and moron ghetto trash rap ""music"" go along with a country gone rogue, as the U.S. supports Israel in its murdering of Palestinian children. Then the idiot American sheep wonder why Arabs fly planes into our buildings. But oh, wait.. it's 'cause, uh, they're ""jealous."" 'Cause Americans are just so special.Anyway, this is a good movie for American man-boys who ""w00t"" at parties.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
97,CMTiago,Thrilling ride if you don't take it seriously,8,3 April 2014,"The sequel to the first G.I.Joe movie gathered some negative reviews like its predecessor. This kind of thing doesn't deter me from watching any movie and one of the reasons is because you have to understand what kind of movie you're going to watch. I know that this is a mindless action flick with a simple plot. It's entertaining and it doesn't have to prove a point by being a perfectly constructed movie. It's meant to look cool and lack any real depth. After getting that out of my system, I can say that I enjoyed watching Retaliation and will try to watch it many times in the future, as this is the kind of film I watch when I wanna have fun. Ranging from The Rock to Willis this movie has very stylistic characters that ultimately kick ass with the Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow battles coming to mind. The special effects also look impressive, particularly in one massive destruction scene. If you like to just lay back and see great fights and a little eye candy then this is the movie for you. Anyone trying to be logic about this I'll just tell you that you are wasting your time.Rating 8/10",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
98,Jonathon_Natsis,Firing blanks.,3,29 March 2013,"For all the mega-money, easily-digestible blockbuster action franchises out there, none may better express the critical, ""you-best-know-what-to-expect"" cynicism of keen movie goers than GI Joe. Commencing with the underwhelming The Rise of Cobra in 2009, continuing with this year's incredibly unnecessary and lazily-titled Retaliation, and an ending that assures there is more to come, the franchise- and this sequel in particular- has become the reluctant stalwart of plot less filmmaking, soulless characters and a humourless script that argues first drafts are for amateurs.When Cobra Commander escapes from his maximum-security holding with plans of world domination, it's up to Duke (Channing Tatum), Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and the rest of the Joes to restore order. When it is revealed that Cobra's plan includes employing master of disguise Zartan to pose as the President (Jonathan Pryce), the soldiers call upon the help of the original Joe himself (Bruce Willis) for a bit of old-school ass kicking.An all-star action cast- who actually do the best they can with the bare minimum on offer- can't mask this film's many flaws. Any attempts to build character through personal tragedy or prior hardships are treated with all the subtlety and caution of The Rock drink-driving in an army tank with a blindfold on. Not unlike a child playing with more toys than he can manage, the film never refutes an opportunity to throw a new character into the mix, and the outcome is an irreparable mess of individuals squeezed into an already convoluted story.So often, the saving grace of films like these is the strong action, but even that has been diluted to PG-13 status. For a hundred minute screening that features guns and samurai swords almost as much as the people who wield them, not a single drop of blood is spilt, leaving a cop-out aftertaste and making GI Joe: Retaliation look increasingly like a straight- to-video endeavour poorly disguised as a mainstream release. There are sure to be many more clunkers in 2013but it's never nice to be the first.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
99,jaxbubba,I didn't hate it.....,5,3 April 2013,"Ummmm, I guess the best thing that I can say about this film is, ""I didn't hate it""!!!! I'm not sure if my expectations were too high for this film, or if I was too tired to enjoy this film (I may try to re-watch and re-assess this film over the weekend). However, this I know for sure, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Channing Tatum cannot act!! Their on scene chemistry was nonexistent, painful to endure, and excruciating to watch. THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN IN THIS FILM WAS THE EARLY DEMISE OF DUKE (aka – Tatum)!!!The action sequences in this film were actually well executed with high impact, and lots of excitement. By far my favorite scenes of the film were the mountain fight sequences in which Snake Eyes and Jinx battle the hordes of Cobra cronies in order to abduct Storm Shadow. This was ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" at its best!!! As if it was scripted straight from the comic books / cartoon series The Cobra soldiers decked out in their signature red outfits, chasing after Snake Eyes and Jinx, all while tethered to repelling ropes atop a treacherous mountain facade it was ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" meets ""Cliffhanger""  a non-stop adrenaline rush of action and mayhem!!! Too bad the rest of the film could not live up to this quite original, highly entertaining sequence.However, where the film fails miserably, are the transition sequences between the action sequences. This is where the audience is forced to undergo the horrific acting, poorly written dialogue, uninspiring camaraderie, and literally movie stopping mumbo-jumbo which nearly brings the film to a screeching halt every time the action sequences are over. It's totally unforgiving how bad these transitional sequences were scripted, acted, and directed. All in all, this is not a bad film; however; this is not a great film either!!!! I am sure watching this film in a theater atmosphere would only enhance your viewing experience. With that said, I will give this film a lukewarm recommendation; if for nothing else, to see and enjoy the mountain action sequence described above. I definitely believe if there is indeed a third G.I. Joe in the work, that the director would actually go back and read/view the source material (comics / TV series) there is way too much missing from these first two interpretations of a highly enjoyable childhood memory.

Characters are stereotypical as without psychological depth, the most part of the scenes are long fights with the aim in themselves: yes, the silent fight mention a cult comics, but is not enough to make the sequence really interesting.

102,Vincent_B,"Make a Lousy Move, This I Command!",2,31 August 2013,"Lacking the cast of favorites from the original movie and killing off all the rest, the movie has no redeeming qualities. When are writers going to stop abusing the overused ""Pearl Harbor sneak attack"" plot device? This has gotten as stale as the Trojan Horse. The only new characters introduced are Jinx, Lady Jaye, Roadblock, and Flint. Jinx is a ninja trained by a blind master to fight in total darkness. It was said that she fought best when blindfolded. Yet the movie doesn't take advantage of that skill. They only used it once as a test, a test that she failed. Roadblock is all muscle and fight so they tossed Duane Johnson in there to draw in the wrestling fans I suppose. But I don't think of him as a good actor. Some fans of the animated TV show may have been somewhat disappointed by the lack of rhymes from Roadblock but the comic book version of Roadblock does not rhyme either. The original Lady Jaye was an expert with a crossbow again a skill not shown in this movie. The only new bad guy introduced is ""Firefly"" and while the character seems to work, I think they made him a tad indestructible. Originally he was supposed to be a saboteur ninja.The movie did not surprise me, there was no big reveals, and Cobra Commander seldom appears in the film. Zartan was a let down as he remains disguised as the U.S. President throughout the entire film. He is a master of disguise yet retains one guise in the whole movie.This movie might as well have been any other sci-fi warfare movie by another name. Seriously there was nothing that screamed out I was watching a movie about G.I. Joe or some other overt action flick.

107,s_campanale,GI Joe gets Real......Perhaps TOO real?,7,13 April 2013,"I was never a big fan of the toys or cartoon growing up, but I did enjoy the 2009 movie version a lot, (being one of Stephen Sommer's few admirers especially) with its mix of heavy character work and incredible fantastical action. As a result I was excited last year about the sequel, until it got pulled at the last minute and despite talk of a January release it's come out at the start of the 2013 summer season. After working in an isolated compound for a further 2 weeks, I finally got to see it this week.I had heard that they were going in a different direction and ditching most of the main characters, so I knew what to expect. This movie is as different to the first one as action movies can be. Gone is most of the sci-fi fantasy element, and in comes a more ""realistic"" scenario that reimages the Joes as the elite US military special forces unit they were always meant to be (All those angry Americans who complained about the UN-isation of the 2009 film got what they wanted I guess) It was quite interesting to see their first 2 missions in North Korea and Pakistan (it's both invigorating and troubling when fantasy steps into the real world, as ""Transformers"" and ""Iron Man"" for example have done) especially since it recalled ""Team America""'s own ""GI JOE"" inspired adventures cleaning up the axis of evil. You could almost hear the turbaned Pakistani terrorists shout ""Durkah! Durkah! Mohammed Jihad!"" as they fired on our heroes! The Joes have also been slimmed down to just a hard core rump now led implausibly by Channing Tatum, who was a newbie in the last movie.The story was already set up by the last film, and it was nice to see Jonathan Pryce make good on the promise of a villainous turn as the Zartan fake President. He is the ""star villain"" of the film and runs with it, especially the pivotal final scene where he blackmails the nuclear powers into surrender with a scene that could have come from the old Batman TV series or any good comic book. Pryce really shines here and channels again Elliot Carver, the best Bond villain of the modern era.The new Cobra weapon is ""Zeus"" – A space satellite that can cause nuclear style destruction without any fallout by dropping a tungsten filled pylon from outer space (gravity and speed do the rest). Another realistic touch, since no doubt such theoretical weapons are being developed as we speak, doubtless to be a fact of life in decades to come just as everyone is now talking about ""Goldeneye"" EMP weapons.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays the main hero ""Roadblock"" as a credible soldier from the hood who now defines his very self by the corps, while his hot sniper ""Lady"" Jaye (Adrianne Palicki, a name made for a B-movie queen) is a committed feminist who has spent her career trying to prove to her now dead military father that women can perform on the front line. Again realism is the name of the game here. Rising hunk D.J Cotrona plays third main Joe ""Flint"" as a real soldier without any real special quirks, but he does well playing off everyone else. Bruce Willis shows up for another emotionless cameo as one of the Joe's founding fathers, with a house full of weapons and a line in shooting from the back of a pick up.On the villain side, Cobra Commander returns (though not played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has become a superstar since creating the angry bitter scarred scientist genius in 2009) this time with a more traditional look, though Destro, an important player in the first film, is inexplicably left in captivity (""You're out of the band"" is all the explanation we get) presumably to return in any future sequels along with a recast Baroness. Biggest new baddie is ""Firefly"", the mercenary with a squad of exploding mini-drone flies, played by hard man actor Ray Stevenson, and naturally gets to tussle with the other burly guy a lot. The film adopts the age old ""B-Movie"" structure of two concurrent stories that meet at the end, so while Roadblock, Lady Jaye and Flint are in America trying to expose the fake President who ordered the hit on their squad, over in Japan and Tibet we have fan favourite Snake Eyes (Still Ray Park but with a redesigned mask sans those silly puckered lips) and Asian Hottie sidekick Jinx (Elodie Yung) tracking down the mysteriously resurrected Cobra Ninja ""Snake Eyes"" (still Byung Hun-Lee) who is getting treated by an old Tibetan witch. Here the film's best sequence occurs, a martial arts duel that turns into a rope grabbing death battle against a squad of Ninjas dangling off the side of the Himalayas which is dizzying and breath-taking. RZA follows up ""Man with the Iron Fists"" with another ""Kung Fu"" role as the blind master seeking justice for Snake Eyes supposed killing of their teacher years before. Truth turns out to be stranger and a damn sight more implausible, and allows the old ""enemies now fight as allies"" trick.The end is a combination race against time to stop Armaggedon and massive multi-layer battle where everyone gets to face off and kill their respective bad guy, featuring Roadblock in a dirt-tank and Ninja vs Ninja action. A final medal giving ceremony by the cameo A-lister (Willis) seals the feeling that this is more a companion to it's (then) contemporary Hasbro stable mate ""Battleship"" than ""Rise of Cobra"". Perhaps that film's terrible failure at the Box Office is the real reason we had to wait a year to get this one? Will there be a third? Probably one day, but who knows what it will look like?",G.I.

108,austin-takahashi,G.I. Joe: Retaliation - 2 Stars,4,3 May 2013,"G.I. Joe: Retaliation is a no-brainer of a movie. If a supernatural force beyond understanding urged you to like ""The Rise of Cobra"", then it is likely that you will enjoy the sequel just as much. Bless you. However, if you hated the 2009 film at least half as much as I did, then you should be smart enough to avoid its 2013 follow-up. Besides, I'm pretty sure that you've long decided on whether you'll see this or not since it's already been out for almost three weeks.Sigh. I shouldn't be writing this review. It's almost 1 in the morning and I have to be at work in a few hours. (Damn it! I have to be at work in a few hours!) So what gives? You see, movies that are as preposterous as ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" are the most fun to review. And, dear reader, when a movie like this is released, I cannot resist. Roger Ebert specialized in reviewing movies that are dumb beyond belief. I write this in further dedication to his spectacular life.For the 15th time, Channing Tatum reprises his role as Channing Tatum. He isn't around for long through as he is quickly replaced by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as the film's lead hero. The Rock (The Tooth Fairy) makes a better action star than Channing Tatum, which doesn't really say much for The Rock, since Justin Timberlake and even Jay Leno would also make a better action star than Tatum. With over 20 movies in his resume, Tatum's career highlight so far is playing a stripper in ""Magic Mike"".

109,feyipuk,CGI Joe,6,24 September 2015,"It's got big explosions, big guns, and some sky high action scenes. It's basically a live action version of what kids would do with the action models if they could. Picking up from the last film, the bad guys are still in the same place and the Joes have had a shake up in the squad. The dialogue still plays second fiddle to the action - half expected them all to shout ""Yo Joe!"" after the opening sequence, but it's not used in the film - and some scenes don't flow; like Roadblock and Duke playing video games. Sure, it introduces his kids, yet with all the macho action it seemed a bit of anti-climax. Likewise, the big destructive scene (a minute into the trailer) takes place in front of that countries leader, who doesn't get any screen time or reaction to such a monumental event! And throwing stars are small enough to hide anywhere, yet you can shoot them without hitting the person who threw them.Sadly, there's no Joseph Gordon-Levitt in it, but as you can't tell who Cobra Commander is, that's not a big loss.",G.I.

The plot is enough to keep things moving along, and the interaction between the characters, while somewhat stilted and greatly contrived, is a good match for how it was back in the days of the TV cartoon. Fans of that should feel at home here; I was one, back in the day, so I'm not just guessing.The first GI Joe movie had a few more light-hearted goofball moments; this one is a little gloomier and grittier, but still mostly within the parameters of GI Joe. What is different here is there's a substantial body count. The deaths are fairly clinical; it's not a gory movie, but still, very young kids might be affected by them. I don't recall much of a body count in the first one, but it's been a while so forgive me if my recall is failing me there.I give this a 7 for those who are looking for an action movie. If you don't like them, you won't like this, so just skip it. If you're up for explosions, fights, and lots of tough stares and macho one-liners, with a little humor too, this is your movie. Also worth seeing for the epic cliff rope battle! LOL.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
111,moviescoundrel,Although this Retaliation took awhile to get here...it's better than the first one,8,27 March 2013,"This film had a decent amount of suspense and a ton of action, basically what you would guess of a movie in this genre. The movie does take itself too serious at times, but most times you're getting lots of action, cheesy dialogue, and a weak plot. The 3D projector was having some issues during the screening which kind of distracted me the first third of the movie, so I hope I'm remembering this vividly.Duane Johnson does a fine job as ""Roadblock"" stepping in as the main hero in this sequel. He rattles off the meaningless dialogue, flexes his muscles, shoots the large heavy machine gun, and knocks out his share of bad guys. Palicki, Park, Willis, and Cotrona are the other Joes left alive, and all do a fine supporting job except for Cotrona who is just not that memorable. I did feel this was better than the first GI Joe movie and while the plot was similar, this had more action, more explosions, more ninja craziness, and less cheese (not none, just less).Check out www.moviescoundrel.com for more",G.I.

112,racoonito,Redemption kind of.,6,25 May 2021,The first movie was kind of underwhelming but this was pretty good. I enjoyed the action especially the grapple hook fight scene. I enjoyed the new characters a lot especially Bruce Willis. There were enough scenes to keep you entertained. It is worth pointing out that the acting was lackluster sometimes and the whole snake eyes and snow soldier thing was confusing. Definitely worth watching for action fans.,G.I. Joe - Retaliation
113,sohansurag,Reloaded...though not retaliative!,6,4 April 2013,"Departing from its original directed by Stephen Sommers and this time directed by Jon M Chu, G.I.Joe Retaliation proves action movies can be dumb and at the same time entertaining. While I can't lie that I never enjoyed G.I.Joe Rise of Cobra, it was still a very mediocre movie. Channing Tatum, a tight latex clad Sierra Miller and the Paris scene elevated the original from the dust to a bit but it's still best forgotten. Sommers' reputation with PG13 movies also didn't help.Jon M Chu who previously directed Step Up 2 and Step Up 3D brings back some of the glory, if not all, that G.I.Joe had lost. G.I.Joe Retaliation brings forth some truly amazing action sequences. The unfortunately the only main lead from the original is killed off initially and we are given a slew of new Joes. Dwayne The Rock Johnson plays the lead Roadblock (He looks like he could be one) accompanied by DJ Cotrona as Flint and the gorgeous Adrianne Palicki as Lady Jaye. Dwayne loses the charm that he'd brought in Fast 5 but still manages to provide a sub par performance. Bruce Willis, the go-to guy for cameos, joins the cast as the General Joe Coulton and yes it was fun having him on board, his scenes with Adrianne promised some chuckles.Adorned with gadgets and armed to the teeth with a number of guns unimaginable, this is any 10-year-old boys wet dream especially if he is a Hasbro G.I.Joe fan. Throw in Adrianne Palicki in a hot dress it becomes even more. Being a fan of her since her Supernatural days, I just loved watching her dishing it out. I do have qualms about Channing Tatums very short cameo and this DJ Cortana who played the second lead. I mean who the hell is this guy replacing Duke? Ray Stevenson had some screen presence playing Firefly, his villainous yet charismatic Isaak Sirko from Dexter still stuck in my mind. RZA was hazardously misplaced in a moviehated it.Having previously helm-ed Step Up 3D, Jon did know how to effectively work with 3D. G.I.Joe Retaliation was supposed to release last year's summer but was delayed till 2013 for 3D post production and as much as I liked the 3D in this movie it still can't justify the close to 8 months delay.There is one word that kept spinning in my mind while watching G I Joe Retaliation: RELENTLESS. The action seldom wanes to give you time to catch breath. You'll have to overlook many factors while watching G I Joe Retaliation, there is no sensible plot for one and there ain't much memorable performances either but if plenty of action is your cup of tea and you are one among who hated the previous installment, then you'll enjoy this one.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
114,brent_or,Disappointing - Surprisingly Dull,5,12 April 2013,"Honestly, I enjoyed this film less than its predecessor, The Rise of Cobra. To me, Retaliation occupies a grey area, too serious to be fun, but too mediocre to really be serious. Even being a longtime G.I. Joe fan who has enthusiasm to burn for these characters, I found myself getting bored. That is the last reaction that viewers should have to a G.I. Joe film. The best thing that The Rise of Cobra had going for it was that it was fun. I have re-watched it multiple times.It seems that the producers/director decided to try and go for a more serious tone here, but neglected to put together a strong enough story to make that plan work.The main thing is that the plot and screenplay are not very good. The cast is excellent, and if they had been given better material to work with, this film could have been far better. As it is, the appeal is limited to a few (but not all) of the action sequences, a few character reveals and vehicle shots that bring out the giddy geek in those of us who played with these things as children, and a couple of jokes. The problematic offset to all of that is that a lot of the action is somehow kind of boring, hard to follow and rather unengaging. Much of the humor feels forced. And the special effects fall short of requisite, consistent realism in some places.The Good – The cast, especially Adrienne Palicki as Lady Jaye and Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock. The ninja battles. Cobra Commander. A couple of vehicle action sequences near the end.The Bad – The screenplay in general. The egregiously implausible rescue-from-prison sequence. The unclear and understated death of a main character early on (I was not sure exactly what had happened until later in the film, despite paying close attention). Some very clunky on-screen, narrated exposition.Ultimately, this is a film strictly for G.I. Joe fans and/or those who want to watch Palicki and Johnson on screen and gloriously firing heavy weaponry. That element is undeniably enjoyable. Unfortunately, it is not enough to make this a recommendably good film, in my opinion. For the next one, they should bring back the same cast but concentrate more on the story.",G.I.

115,jakerocks,Terrible story,1,31 July 2021,I don't care what you do to Channing Tatum. But I hate what you did to Duke. The messiest story ever. This isn't GI Joe.,G.I. Joe - Retaliation

From my point of view, it was kind of OK (and I saw all the movies and the cartoon). The acting is fine. Especially Dwayne Johnson was quite good. Directing is not that great. Story telling is weak. Special effects are good. If more time was spent for character development, the movie would be more understandable for people that are not familiar with G.I. Joe. In the end, the action was pretty good but there were so many characters without any background. Moral of the story, if you just want to see an action movie but you have no idea what G.I. Joe is, don't even think about watching it. Otherwise, you can give it a try.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
117,Legendary_Badass,G.I. No,7,28 March 2013,"2009's G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was by most accounts an odd flick. The trailer left a bad taste in my mouth. The productions values didn't match the astonishing budget. The script left something to be desired. It may not have been a good movie, but it provided entertainment. Hey, the task to construct a sensible movie out of a toy line littered with sci-fi inspired vehicles and characters who shoot guns without killing each other isn't a walk in the park. It exceeded my admittedly low expectations, and even appeared to set the groundwork for an improved sequel. That sequel is G.I. Joe: Retaliation, but is it an improvement? There aren't a lot of returning faces among the Joes, the heroic Special Forces squad tasked with saving the world. Duke (Tatum Channing) is now captain of a team, which includes Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson) and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). The only other returning hero is Snake Eyes (Ray Park), a ninja whose lack of countenance and vocals may as well mark him as unfamiliar. Playing off the conclusion of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, the President of the United States has been captured and replaced by a double seeking to rule the world. When the opportunity arises he strikes to wipe out the G.I. Joes.This time around out heroes have at least one foot grounded in reality. There's no more secret base beneath the pyramids. The cavalcade of Star Wars derived vehicles have been melted for scrap, possibly to construct the contemporary-esque armor worn by the personnel. Though the costumes are awesome, this franchise isn't served well through gritty reinvention. This is no reboot, but a loose continuation akin to what The Incredible Hulk (2008) was to The Hulk (2003). A mere 15 minutes in, a highly unfortunate casting decision lets the air out of the movie, at which point chemistry takes a frag grenade to the chest.Hard to believe it's been nearly 4 years between releases. This treatment was postponed for the addition of 3D, which this viewer neglected. It's tough enough keeping track of the action in a more traditional format. New director to the franchise, Jon M. Chu (Step Up 2: The Streets), keeps the action dizzying. Save for a stunning ninja battle across cliffs, I couldn't sense out of what I was seeing, who was shooting at what. I heralded the previous film as the best ninja action of the year. Here, I'm not fully convinced any actors completed a given move without the magic of editing. Visual effects are far more realistic, but what good are they when married to a lack of ambition?The downsized set pieces take away what made G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra unique. So while this movie may appear up to par with bigger names on board, especially an appearance by Bruce Willis, there are few moments that push the envelope. G.I. Joe: Retaliation gets right everything the last movie did wrong, while getting wrong everything it did right. What should have been an easy upgrade becomes a push.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
118,aldri-feb,"Good action sequence, but lack in story",5,2 April 2013,"For me this installment doesn't look like a G.I.Joe movie. G.I.Joe identical with their magical gadgets that is not shown in this movie except the fireflies. Some scenes even more like The Expendables rather than G.I.Joe. But actually the action is acceptable and cool. I quite enjoy some of the action scenes, it's fun.The development story of this movie is the weakest element. The story is a mess and very silly, they don't think about humanity and just destroy everything. I think the G.I.Joe forces has failed doing their duty to protect the world. The selection of Dwayne Johnson in this movie is not the right decision. He always acts the same at almost all of his movie and make this G.I.Joe feels like B-Movie. I'd prefer the first installment cast like Dennis Quaid and Sienna Miller better than Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis.Still this second installment is a fun and enjoyable movie to watch. It's full action movie that have some cool scenes. But there are many holes in plot and really silly. If you like kind of non-stop action movie without concerns about everything, you'll love this one.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
119,MVictorPjinsiste,Not So Toyetic.,5,14 June 2019,"The first GI Joe movie wasn't a critic-pleaser, but as a toy-selling, somewhat juvenile adventure it worked: It was easy to turn your brain off and go along for the ride, humour, adventure and even a bit of romance.This one is grittier, and in it, the Joes suddenly are just another tentacle of the American military, fighting the classical US ennemies of the day, being basically navy SEALS or Delta Force, you know, sweaty testosterone guys with guns and an attitude. And the guns, the stuff in general, are quite mundane modern automatic weapons, not the toyetic gizmos that appeared in the same movies, despite some plot-convenient devices.Still, the actors are great, even if often let to themselves; The Rock is likeable as always, Pryce is excellent as always, but Stevenson and Willis look somewhat lost. The rest is doing alright with the exception of Cobra Commander, which I just couldn't take seriously and neither could any actor he met in the scenes. He looked more like the King's jester or mascot than the King himself.The action sequences are often chaotic, with quick camera close-ups, dark tones and stuff. One of these was the quite fine fight on a mountainside, and on this subject I liked the story arc for Storm Shadow's character development, althought it somewhat lacked in drama.It's the kind of movie that's alright, but forgettable and mundane, and what's worse, not as good as its predecessor, which was more fantasist in tone. Because, after all, what we want to sell here are the toys, isn't it?",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
120,freemanpatrick7,Probably better if you love video games,6,25 May 2013,"This is the last time I sit in the middle of the row. Had I been sitting on the aisle I would have left long before the movie was over.Maybe if I were in the 13 to 24 age bracket and had grown up playing video games...Or maybe if I were still a little boy at heart and still played video games...One reviewer lauded the ""jaw dropping"" visual fx. Really? Was this person exaggerating or just haven't been to the movies in about 20 years? Nothing new here. Same visual fx you'll see in any 200 million movie or a video game.The bottom line is this movie is just like a big long expensive video game. If you like that then go see it. Except don't be disappointed if they don't let you have the controller.Don't get me wrong, I think it's totally cool when a bad guy can get run over by and Escalade(after having beaten up The Rock, for crying out loud) and get right back up and run away. It's also kind of cool that he can get on a motorcycle, start it, put it in gear AND ride safely away in less time than it takes for said Escalade to hit a dumpster. Also, it was interesting that Duke had the time to yell ""Incoming"" get Flint out of the way yet he sits there and takes it like a man. I guess Tatum wanted out of his contract. Maybe he saw this going the same way as Police Academy 15.I'm not sure why I expect so much from a movie based on a toy. My only question is where will they go next? They have GI Joe, Battle Ship, Transformers, Rock'em Sock'em Robots(Real Steel)... what's next? Toss Across? Battling Tops? Maybe they'll make a sci-fi flick about silly putty. (I wonder if producers read these things to get ideas)And the dialog was pretty bad. I was trying to remember one particular line that was really bad but I guess it was so disgusting that it ran screaming out of my memory. RZA was the absolute worst part of the whole thing. The Rat in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a better actor than RZA. Where's Master Po when you need him? I'm not sure why anyone thinks Rappers make good actors. Anyway, lots of action, some way hot chicks who kick but (always cool, IMO) AND there will probably be another sequel.If all that sounds like it's worth $10 bucks to you then have at it. I wait until movies come to the $2 theater and sometimes they aren't even worth that much.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
121,RyanEberhart,Could have been better,6,6 September 2013,"Not sure how I feel about G.I. Joe: Retaliation. I have some mixed feelings. When I think about watching the cartoon of G.I. Joe as a kid there were never any casualties. I know expecting that in a live action movie like this one is asking too much, but one of the main characters, Duke (Channing Tatum), is killed in the first 20 minutes or so.I do have to say that the special effects are pretty good in this movie, not up to par compared to the first movie, but acceptable. The firefly explosives are interesting, the nanomites are present still (at least as far as Zartan is concerned), and some of the weapons are pretty cool. But over all, it felt like everything was scaled back somewhat.All of that being said, there are still some pretty cool scenes that I liked very much.The first scene I liked is the scene where Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Jinx (Elodie Yung) travel to a mountainous retreat to retrieve Stormshadow (Byung-hun Lee) to answer for his crime of killing his Master when he was still a child. A lot of the fighting that Jinx and Snake Eyes have to do are done on repelling ropes. The scene ends, or at least continues, when Stormshadow is brought before the Blind Master (RZA) and it is revealed that Stormshadow did not kill his Master... I won't reveal who did, you'll have to watch the movie.Another scene I liked was when Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and General Joe Colton (Bruce Willis) are sent to rescue the President (Jonathan Pryce). Colton laying down in the El Camino bed and popping open the tailgate while firing his machine gun taking out the guards was pretty cool. However, Jaye did something she probably shouldn't have done. Again, watch the movie to see what she did.Another scene I liked was where Stormshadow avenged his Master. But I won't tell you who it was he killed. I also won't tell you what he did to avenge his Master.I didn't like the fact that Ripcord, Scarlett, The Baroness, General Hawk, Heavy Duty and Breaker are not in this movie. I don't like that Duke is killed. Nor do I like that Destro is left in prison by Cobra Commander. But I am not meant to. I don't remember Firefly (Ray Stevenson), but he was pretty cool in the movie, at least his firefly explosives were cool. It was interesting to see the ninja society that Snake Eyes belongs to and their dealings with Stormshadow. No offense to the male characters that didn't come back, but replacing Scarlett (Rachel Nichols) with Jaye is at least an even trade. Replacing Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) with Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), technically not a replacement but..., I wondered why Roadblock wasn't in the first movie.After all of that, I give this movie 6 stars out of 10.",G.I.

122,jpachar82,Joe Style...Retaliation,8,30 March 2013,"This movie is like putting pieces of a puzzle together. We left off in the first movie (The Rise of Cobra) when Cobra Commander a.k.a.

But it seems like the President was ""off his rocker."" So we come to the second movie, which does a great job of recapping for us. The Commander is released and set to destroy the world with the help of a powerful man who claims to be the free leader of the world. The Joes step in and they foil the Commander's plans.To be completely honest, this movie was great just it was kind of boring to me (in some places). They kill of Destro and Duke Hauser.

Their lines were great and I think they fit their parts perfectly. I don't know the other stars of the movie, but they did a really good job too! The action scenes were great as usual, you didn't really expect some of the things that happened and one thing I wish didn't happen. The president part was clever and done very well, I was surprised at that! Was so not expecting it!

124,BatStarIndyFreak,Take an 80's pill and enjoy,7,3 January 2016,"I don't know if it was on purpose, but here they took an 80's property, gave it the same flavor as ""Commando"" with all its extreme scenarios, and gave it 10's level practical effects. This is one movie I obligated myself to watch it. Why? It had my favorite Joe in Roadblock, who was given the best possible casting (seeing how Michael Clarke Duncan's passing made him unavailable). It's generally accepted that Dwayne Johnson makes good with his time on camera in every role, and I loved every minute of it here. No argument that the plot is paper-thin...OK--RICE paper, but you take on that 80's mentality, it becomes a worthwhile guilty pleasure. Cobra Commander's few scenes showed him being more convincing than what we saw in the 80's cartoons. It was something interesting to see Jonathan Pryce as a good guy, though he's cast to primarily use his bad guy acting skills. Too bad we didn't get much of Arnold Vosloo. I enjoyed Flint (though in the cartoon, he was much higher in command) and Lady Jay. So overall, a good bit of ""check your brains at the box office fun"".",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
125,Brownsbros3,Much better than the first one,8,3 August 2013,"The series rebounded nicely after that horrible first movie. The best thing they did was kill off that no-talent bum Channing Tatum early in the film. I don't believe the trivia that says they added more scenes with him and Dwayne Johnson because they tested well with audiences. Those scenes were stupid, and not funny at all. I thought it was heading towards being worse than the first one, but once Duke is killed the movie gets a lot better, mainly because we don't have to spend another 90 minutes watching Tatum's lousy acting. Instead, they made Dwayne Johnson the star, and the Rock shined as he always does. I thought they could have used Flint more, because he was one of the main leaders on the original animated series. The character of Cobra Commander was also underused. I liked the addition of Firefly, and angle with Snake Eyes, Jinx, and Storm Shadow. Bruce Willis also has a nice cameo as the original G.I. Joe. After having reservations, I'm glad they made this film, and hopefully we get a third. There are so many great characters that still have yet to be used.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

127,jpkwolf,Fixes the franchise as much that is possible without rebooting it *Small spoilers ahead*,8,8 April 2013,"I thought the first G.I. Joe movie was watchable, as cheesy and childish it was. Clearly Stephen Sommers is not a very competent director and because of that there was lots of room for improvement. Here we fortunately get Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis instead of Marlon Wayans. Retaliation feels more serious and grounded. We get a good PG-13 action movie and this time the comedy elements actually work. What I felt the first movie got quite right was Cobra. Here things are improved with Cobra Commander looking like he should. Ray Stevenson is great as a bad ass criminal/terrorist Firefly. Jonathan Pryce also throws a delicious performance as the over the top evil doppelganger president. This kind of movie needs good bad guys.The action is good but not great. Most memorable being the mountain side ninja fight like all the critics point out. Also worth mentioning is the ""gunkata"" style fight with Dwayne Johnson and Ray Stevenson in the end. The movie keeps you entertained with quite constant action, one liners and some visual treats like the destruction of London scene. Not deep or a perfect movie but much more plausible and acceptable popcorn entertainment than the first film. The 3D was also pretty good for a converted movie. Although Jon M. Chung has previously directed only some forgettable dance movies, here he manages to fix as much that is possible without rebooting the franchise. Of course what I would really like to see is deep character development, R-rated story and action but we will never get to see that with something like G.I. Joe. At the end of the movie when Bruce Willis gives Lady Jaye her medal, I cried a tear of pride, an American bald headed eagle landed on my shoulder, he squawked the national anthem of United States of America and Cobra was once again defeated.",G.I.

129,michaelheiser-25099,Good film,8,6 November 2021,Good film from 'Crazy Rich Asians' filmmaker. I liked that film a million times better than this. Palicki at least gets a little bit to play with but she is way underused and that's unfortunate because she does a decent job. Jonathan Pryce also returns from the first film but gets a much bigger part and does quite well at it. He is very good in his dual roles as villain and President of The United States. I was actually surprised because I didn't realize Channing Tatum wasn't returning for the whole film. He has almost a cameo role which even that was apparently made bigger to appease fans but he isn't there much. Luke Bracey is good as the new Cobra Commander (considering the character was hardly in the first film.) He is once again underused in this film when he should be the biggest villain. I can't honestly say anyone else is worth mentioning. They either have incredibly small roles or roles not worth mentioning because of lack of development. Bruce Willis (one of my personal Hollywood idols) is barely in the film which I sort of expecte.,G.I. Joe - Retaliation
130,HeartMonger,"What happened to movie? G.I. Joe: Retaliation is ALL BRAWN, and NO BRAIN.",1,28 March 2013,"It's amazing how many good movies produced this year have been relegated to sub-par status, while others that shouldn't be given a glance are given zenith status as great pieces of work, art, and other such pop-cultural sub- standard excrescences achieve more than their worth in fool's gold. One such picture - I'm sorry - movie, that audiences will endure a release of, either glorifyingly, or harshly, is G.I. Joe: Retaliation, the new brawn packed action farce from Paramount Pictures.Starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, and with appearances by Bruce Willis and Channing Tatum, the film offers no social commentary, consists of nothing remotely engaging (I tended to doze off on even the action scenes), and pities itself with egregious CGI 3-D effects that disappear mid-air depending on where one sits in the audience. There is no basis for being an audience member, because the effects are so jarring, that the viewer will not be able to involve itself to anything worth sitting for an hour and forty minutes for (which trust me, there wouldn't be anyway.) But that's not the half of the film's problems.The real problem stems from lack of plot. More like no plot. The film is supposed to be a sequel, or rather, a continuation of the original G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra, but even by todays standards, the filmmakers weren't trying to mark any new ground. All we get is one action sequence after another. Even James Cameron knows you need a through-line of plot device to make these kinds of movies work, but director Jon M. Chu doesn't have enough respect for the audience to even give them that. Instead, we are mindlessly treated to fast shots of punches being thrown, with no idea who is throwing them, why, or if we should care. Seriously. We only know one thing. The good guys will always win. Never a good sign when you go to the movies to know how they end, with no conscious minding of what it will take to get there. Don't waste your money, my friends. Still, more muscular contractions ache this bastard of a performer.Those involved knew this was just a paycheck - examine the evidence; Dennis Quaid did not return, and subsequently they need Bruce Willis to carry the big name legacy. Channing Tatum has his screen time terminally reduced, not a great sign because most audiences will probably be wanting to see the film solely for his performance. The writer was clearly hired to write a how-to on perfecting scripts for CGI based stories. This wouldn't be such an insult to film purists and enthusiasts alike if it wasn't such a dreary waste of time and money. There is nothing there in terms of story or structure. The movie starts, and it's action scenes strung together with no link. Then you leave. I would disclose such a plot to entice what viewers may challenge the notion of wasting their money if such a plot existed! It's a disgusting practice of show-off acrobatics by computer geniuses that would be better suited decrypting or ciphering codes left behind from the Zodiac Killer or the Unabomber! This is not why we go to the movies. We go to be entertained, and I predict that many an audience member be robbed of their hard earned cash in this recession, and by such standards and caused an equal recession in film quality! Honestly, there has to be a better place for films in today being tomorrow's history, than this!An early release for such a seemingly summer blockbuster - it's obvious Paramount wants to get this one out of the way, so they don't have to worry about a summer release tanking to the bottom of the swimming pool (a place where the pre-teens normally disposed to this mendicant tar would be better off spending the day.) It's futile to promote a product without any real integrity, or so I thought. Amazing what a little muscle can do. It's already seen some couple million smackers (across the face!) for it's previews and advance releases, but when it all comes down, G.I. Joe: Retaliation is one hunk of movie that holds a strong PR campaign in it's biceps, but can't think for itself, and never latches on to the timeless fact that the real strength of a movie lies in it's story and it's characters, both factors of the machine that are simultaneously weak.",G.I.

131,talarisw,A long awaited sequel to the 2009 movie based on the iconic 80's cartoon series/toy line with the special military force stopping the terrorist organization called Cobra.,5,4 April 2013,"I really like the original 2009 predecessor film but I'm very disappointed by this long awaited sequel. Let me first say that unlike most professional film critics who never seen a G.I. Joe cartoon, I'm a true fan who's seen the cartoon and know the characters. So while many can just brush off both films as being just cheesy, action driven, special effect filled blockbusters, I look at it from the view of is this a satisfying adaption of the classic cartoon. So from that view the first film does a much better job at being a more satisfying/faithful adaption. What I like about the first film is that it had a more creative and inspired story. The first film did a good job in introducing the G.I. Joe operation and it's characters. The first film also did a really good job with the villains,Cobra came off as genuinely threatening and dangerous. The action scenes were really good like for example the action sequence in Paris. The rivalry with Snake- eyes and Storm shadow was good and I like the plot twist with who would become Cobra commander. Stephen Sommons did a much better job directing the last one then Jon M. Chu did directing this one. I felt the story for this one was very weak. I hate how Chu disregards so much from the original film, the only Joe to return from the last film is Duke played by Chantam Tantum. Ribcage played by Marlon Wayans who was his best friend from the 1st film disappears with no explanation to his where abouts. Other Joe's like Scarlett and General Hawk are also gone with no explanation. Chu could of at least explained where all the characters from the 1st film gone too and quite frankly there was no need to write them out of this movie even if they had different actors playing them it would of worked better. Killing off Duke/Tantum 15 minutes into the movie served no real plot purpose. New Joes were introduced Lady Jane, Flint and Roadblock played by ""the Rock"", who were all okay. ""The Rock"" did a good job in his part and so did Bruce Willis although his character wasn't really necessary to the plot. But the villains were very weak. I like the actor who played the fake president though out the film, I thought he did a good job and I'm glad that they continued that storyline from the 1st film. But the iconic villain, Cobra commander was very weak here. He got little screen time and did little. I feel most disappointed in the villains, especially since the 1st film was such a nice set-up for Cobra to come back for revenge. The last film spent so much time setting up Cobra commander and how Cobra would come to be. Cobra commander's real identity as Rex is not acknowledge here. I like how the 1st film depict the rise of Cobra. In the 1st film a guy named Mccluin was running a terrorist organization but a scientist named Rex, who was working for Mcculain turned against him and turned Mcculain's face metal making him into Destro and he took over becoming Cobra commander. Rex was good friends with Duke of the Joe's but Rex was believed to have died in a war. Duke was going out with his sister but Rex brainwashed her and made her an assistant to Mcculain's operations becoming the Baroness. As you can see that's a pretty complex and interesting set-up for the villains but all of that is disregarded here or not continued and it's just a simple Cobra commander back for revenge. The worst thing are the absence of Destro and the Baroness. People who know the cartoon know that Cobra commander's lieutenants are Destro and the Baroness. And for no good reason they're not in this movie. They tease us with the return of Destro but he never does. And that's really a disappointment because they gave him such a nice set-up for him to return and they don't even bother to explain where the Baroness is. As a G.I. Joe fan I find that to be unacceptable. Even if they got different actors to play them, Destro and Baroness should of been in here, standing side by side with Cobra commander exacting revenge on the Joes. They don't explain how Storm shadow came back after being apparently killed in the last film. One of the good things about this movie is great stunt man Ray Parker returning as Snake-eyes. Overall I find this to be a disappointing sequel to the 2009 film and to the classic 80's cartoon series.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
132,varnium,Unworthy of the Title,3,28 November 2016,"This is the most disappointing sequel of the GI Joe series. The first film was fantastic. Lots of high-tech gadgets, uniquely diversified combat scene, and full blown action cuts. After all, the initial GI Joe film was popular due to those traits.But somehow someone in the studio made some stupid decision to eliminate all of those traits. And removed every favorable characters with ""The Rock"". I wonder what were they thinking when they made that decision.The desert scene, where the Joes are annihilated, are an example of the terrible decision. Where are all of those cool techs that the Joes used in the first movie? They would have survived it if the techs are there. But unfortunately, the story maker had too much alcohol and forgot about that part.In short, it's a major disappointment for all GI Joe fans.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

134,knowyourmovie,Just another mediocre action movie with an annoyingly silly plot...,6,12 May 2013,"Why Hollywood keeps producing such mediocre movies as ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" is a question with an easy answer – because it sells. About a month after the release, the movie has already collected at the box office more than twice of its relatively large $130 million production budget.Why crowds keep watching these mediocre movies is another easy question. Sadly, people have always preferred crude low farce and street circus to high forms of art. It has not changed in thousands of years and is unlikely to change in the future.And yet I cannot help but wondering, why not to spend a very small token of these mighty $130 million on hiring a solid director and decent screenplay writer? I guess that the answer would be ""Why bother if ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" became a box office hit even with Jon M. Chu at the shaky helm and with Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick at the squeaky typewriter?Jon M. Chu is notoriously famous for his 2011 documentary ""Justin Bieber: Never Say Never"" that received a whooping 1.7 out of 10 rating on IMDb.The record of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick is equally ""impressive"" and consists of writing for some obscure TV shows as well as for a zombie movie.It almost looks like the notorious zombie theme was still on the screenwriters' minds when they started working on ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"". Their expedition to the abandoned movie dumpsters in the desperate search for some nicely rotten leftovers reminded me the behavior of raccoons swiftly going through the smelly garbage in the dead of the night.Needless to say, liberally fertilizing with the cheap second hand movie trash from the dumpster - worn-out masks, rusty samurai swords, dirty military trucks, and damp explosive arsenals - did not make the already shallow story of ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" any better.A good action movie does not have to have a clever plot, but still needs a decent, solidly built structure without unforgivable shortcomings. Unfortunately, the story in ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" not only manages to be painfully predictable, extraordinary silly and hopelessly incoherent at the same time, but it also makes less and less sense as the movie progresses.A good action movie does not have to have powerful character development, but it still has to have likable (or repulsive in case of a villain), charismatic, reasonably believable characters and not the one- dimensional, paper-thin stooges that look like they were borrowed from some disastrous toddler cartoon.A good action movie needs to have some well-blended exciting action sequences that keep adrenalin pumping and help maintaining the viewers' interest, and not a random sequence of disappointingly short, painfully unoriginal, sloppily executed, loosely connected, disjointed scenes that constitute the action component in ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"". A good action movie does not have to tackle the complex issues of human existence in a powerful way, but it still needs to maintain at least a minimal level of genuineness in portraying most basic human feelings, emotions, and values.Whenever ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" touches any significant matters of life, whether family, friendship, love, honor, or military bond the movie comes across as so shamelessly superficial that it leaves the viewer in uncomfortable disgust.The acting in ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" was mostly on a par with its story and directing. Seemingly left without meaningful guidance from the director to deal with their fundamentally fake characters, industrious actors Dwayne Johnson (Roadblock) and Channing Tatum (Duke) heavily relied on their charisma with the mostly unsatisfactory results.The only exception was the performance of the versatile Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce whose President (as well as the impostor Zartan) were the only two believable characters in the movie grossly outnumbered by the multitude of the pitiful lifeless puppets, played by the rest of the acting crew.Another exception, but of a different kind, was Bruce Willis whose comic performance in the small role of the veteran General Joe Colton was quite enjoyable, but only because of its grotesque and the signature self-irony that Bruce Willis is so good at. Overall, ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" is one of those mediocre, derivative movies that can be easily ignored without any regrets or second thoughts. In fact, I think you would do yourself a favor if you do not see the movie and save the time for doing something more meaningful and less insulting to both intellect and good taste.www.knowyourmovie.com",G.I.

But it seems like the President was ""off his rocker."" So we come to the second movie, which does a great job of recapping for us. The Commander is released and set to destroy the world with the help of a powerful man who claims to be the free leader of the world. The Joes step in and they foil the Commander's plans.To be completely honest, this movie was great just it was kind of boring to me (in some places). They kill of Destro and Duke Hauser.

137,alucard_castlevania86,A bit of A Disappointment Storywise,6,27 March 2013,"I had 50/50 hopes for this movie and felt a bit bummed out when it was told that it will be delayed to March 2013 but I thought maybe it was for the best so I decided to give it chance. Now after nearly a year of waiting, I have to say I was a bit disappointedFirst off, they promised to explain what happened to the characters in the previous film that didn't show up (ripcord, Scarlett etc.) but no explanation was given whatsoever as well as wanting to strengthen Duke and Baroness character but nothing was ever explained. 2nd storywise, it was not that very interesting in my opinion and there some parts which I find a bit illogic and not explained like how did Storm Shadow survive. The guy just like appeared out of no whereCharacter wise, Cobra rules compared to the Joes. Lady Jaye and Flint were not really that interesting to watch and the romance between them didn't really look that convincing. Killing off Duke Hauser (Channing Tatum)and letting Roadblock (The Rock) take over as team leader for me was the biggest letdown in my opinion since he never really looked that great playing the lead role. Bruce Willis was OK a Joe but nothing exciting but for me the best Joe out there would have to be Snake Eyes (Ray Park). His performances were great as usual and really made the movie looked excitingAs for the villains, I really wanted to see Zartan fight with somebody but that didn't happen. Destro was the biggest disappointment for me since they killed his character off just like that. Cobra Commander looked better in this outfit that the previous one but there was really nothing from him but in my opinion, the best villain and character of the entire movie has got to go to Firefly (Ray Stevenson) His character was so wicked cool and I really loved how those nano flys were used as his explosion device. Though a villain, he stood out the most in the film for me I can't say much for the rest of the cast like Storm Shadow and Jinx since there wasn't really anything much from themHowever I find it kind of hard to believe that this is a G.I Joe movie since apart from Snake Eyes, there wasn't really anything that made me feel that these guys were the G.I Joes since it felt like there were very little connection between this team to the previous G.I Joe team in the first movieOverall a bit of a letdown compared to the first movie and it didn't seemed like it was a sequel to the first G.I Joe movie and it wasn't really worth watching it in 3D either",G.I.

No, the movie isn't perfect. It definitely has it's flaws. There are some joke attempts that when told, you can her crickets in the studio and some casting choices that are beyond laughable (don't want to give it away but you'll know when you see it). But overall, it's a fun action movie to go see with your buddies or on a a weekend date with your boo.I love action movies and I really enjoyed this one. The action was great, the costumes were nice and the main characters were a good team. You can tell John M. Chu is an amateur director because there are some things in the movie he should have just said ""No, that's whack, take that out"" But he didn't. But I guess it's about trial and error. There are some changes in the movies that might be a little hard to accept by fans or movie goers who went in their expecting a certain type of movie, but I thought they were good changes. Let me also say that, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, looks extra delicious in this movie. I just wanted to jump through the TV and have his babies, but I digress. I appreciated some of the more vulnerable scenes with the main characters that gave us an insight on their drive for being soldiers. But the best scene, with no contest, is the scene with Snake Eyes and his protégé, Jinx, as they battle ninjas on an icy mountain, literally, in the air. That was a dope scene and wasn't too short at all. G.I. Joe Retaliation is just a fun, cheesy film to tickle the fancy of action movie lovers who are fond of Heroic teams kicking ass, shooting guns, witty villains and cool action sequences.

Joe: Retaliation like action scenes any day over it. The swinging lines scene is just amazing! What really makes this film, is it's overflowing with energy. Not only in the action, but the actors. From the Rock leading the way to supporting characters like Jonathan Pryce, Walton Goggins, Ray Stevenson, and Bruce Willis in his cameo, GI J:R understands humor, swag and wit is essential to a film like this. Pryce's humor especially KILLS as Zartan/the president. When the first line out of Cobra Commander's mouth was ""You're out of the band, Destro"", I knew this sequel would have self-aware wit and sharpness the original lacked.At the same time, despite a film that embraces ridiculousness and absurdity - its lead characters still have self-seriousness. This actually makes the film better, by giving just enough believability and stakes to their actions and the plot. We want the villains to be goofy but the leads to be intense and serious.The plot is proudly big and ridiculous, highlighted by the terrific scene with Pryce and the world leaders, North Korea and Global Warming jokes included. It embraces the villains' hilariously unoriginal nuclear domination plan, Zartan all but puts his pinky to his mouth and cackles.GI Joe: Retaliation knows what it is and knows how to bring the energy in action and humor in spades.

141,zzoaozz,It's boring,4,29 March 2013,"I can't believe I am saying this since I am a huge GI Joe fan... but this movie is just kind of boring. I loved the first movie and had high hopes for this one even though I knew most of the cast of the first movie weren't returning. It just did not deliver. The acting was good, no problem there. The visuals were well done and the special effects were alright. It had plenty of fights and best of all Storm Shadow came over to the good side at least temporarily, something that didn't happen for years and years in the comics. Snake Eyes, Jinx, and Storm Shadow were fantastic. Their relationships came across as complex and their emotions deeply suppressed but real. There is no reason this should not have been a fantastic movie but it wasn't. No one thing failed, but as a whole it failed. Some things I can put my finger on: Too much time was spent early on revealing that Roadblock and Duke had a deep friendship both on and off duty. Too much time was spent on a couple of missions at the beginning of the movie. The only reason for them seemed to be to show that the Joes were a military team and that Snake Eyes was away for some reason unknown to them. These scenes were filled with jerky camera fighting and creeping through dark industrial settings and while these are both super popular movie devices at the moment they are old and stale to audiences. It took too long for the surviving Joes to escape the desert establish a base of operations and gather allies. It was just one long boring stretch from the firefight in the dessert with the occasional jump to what the three ninjas were doing to keep you from wandering off or dozing off totally. The fight scenes were too long and tedious, especially the factory scenes previously mentioned and the climax fight between Roadblock and Firefly. There were way too many dialogs that were obviously meant to explain things but were unnecessary, Zartan was the worst offender going on about how he was enjoying being president, how the president was still needed, how the nanomites made him immune to injury, he even took eternity when threatening the nuclear powers of the world. Others were guilty of explaining things to death too, but he was the worst. The ending was good but it just took too long to get there. Maybe if they had spent more time on the ninjas' story line it would have flowed better. I think the editor is the one who dropped the ball on this movie. I am disappointed.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

Joe comic books than it is to the cartoons.But, if there's any missteps here, I'd say it's the representation of Lady Jaye's character in the movie. I mean, from what I've been seeing from the cartoons, Lady Jaye is supposed to be described as a stereotypical tomboy character. But in the movie, she's just a substitute for Scarlett and Cover Girl's characters since Scarlett is absent and Cover Girl is now dead in the first live-action movie.Overall, I'd say that this movie is very underrated.

143,darkraven_109,Simple and enjoyable popcorn movie,7,4 April 2013,"The first GI JOE directed by Stephen Sommers was a joke; it didn't resemble the old GI JOE cartoons or anything related to the license. The action was weak, the cast was too unwieldy, it didn't even look like GI JOE and overall, a waste of money. The sequel/ reboot, thankfully, avoids all of these faults and gives a movie worth my time and money. It's everything the first movie should've been.The tone of the movie was great. It may take place in modern times (you got touchscreen computers all over the place) but it still lives in the GI JOE universe (Firefly's entire arsenal of creative explosives speaks for itself). The successful combination of realism and imagination bleeds throughout the whole movie and it's part of what made the movie enjoyable.The characters are fewer but better; now that the cast list has been cut to half its size in the first installment, there's more time for the writers to add what development they could to people based on an 80's cartoon. The characterizations weren't the best but they were more than something. Each and every single character was great, all of them having their own distinct personalities instead of being cardboard copies of each other or some other character. Whether Joe or Cobra, it wasn't hard to pick a favorite from each side.A small problem with the cast, though, was that some of the characters didn't get the amount of screen presence they deserved, such as Duke and (especially) Cobra Commander. Characters from the previous movie aren't even mentioned and in the case of a certain big named GI JOE character, left forgotten. Now it was nice to see the effort put behind the movie's attempt to leave part one in the dust by removing half of the cast but it would've been nice if some explanation as to what happened to the other JOES was given.The action was actually enjoyable this time around, with a mix of firefights, vehicle combat and ninja duels, all of which are done with a good eye for adrenaline. The camera was thankfully held in place and it made watching the action scenes a lot easier on the eye. some of the CGI looked too fake in some parts, but thankfully the CGI was used sparingly and only when necessary. The main problem the movie had was the weak resolution and revelation of certain key subplots. I'm not going to spoil any of them but when a major subplot was introduced, it was abruptly ended in less than a few seconds when the movie was nearing its end. Loose ends were hanging by the end but this didn't cost the movie dearly; while it did leave me wanting some closure to the given problem, it didn't hinder the fact that I had a blast watching RETALIATION.GI JOE: RETALIATION should serve as a lesson to future movies based on some old license; it's fine to have a reboot, it's fine to change the tone into a gritty one but never forget what made those titles popular in the first place: fun. RETALIATION successfully combined the limits of reality and the inspiration of the franchise to deliver a movie that doesn't only resemble the cartoons (only grittier this time around) but a simple action movie that can entertain both JOE fans and those who are new to the franchise.",G.I.

Sorry, I haven't seen them, but you do get the picture, right? Rise of the Cobra was good fun if not excellent fun, and then add to that The Rock and the trailers were great, but the movie... Firstly it was too comical with Nuclear weapons being self destructed by the hero at the 0 second, the fight scene in the mountains between the Ninjas were anything but spectacular, it was really comical and hilarious, (I mean, C'Mon now!), the whole house of Willis was full of weapons hiding in every nook and corner EVERYTHING WAS SO VERY PREDICTABLE! Willis was wasted, there was no Baroness, The Rock couldn't do much to save the film and believe me, RZA was again in this movie as a Martial Arts Grandmaster!!!!! It had all the big toys for a blockbuster, but the screenplay was so bad, I would actually blame MGM or whoever the producers were for picking on that Director. There was not much '3D' to be actually enjoyed, IMAX... same, accept for 1 visually stunning spectacular (an you can add more) scene where an entire city was blown out. That, I must say was good.Even the recent Hansel and Gretel was less childish and more fun. 2 stars just because it starred the Rock",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

With Dwayne and Willis joining the big cast the movie had even an huge impact than the first film. The Impersonating of the President on the command of Cobra their plan destroying the earth and G.I. Joe's headed outnumbered and out gunned forming a plan to stop it . They also ended good the death of Duke but hope he will return maybe for a third installment in the G.I.

Great performance by Dwayne , Willis & Tatum also from Ray ( Snake Eyes ) and Byung-Hun Lee ( Storm Shadow ) fighting for the good side this time !",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
147,rdbrown-zeteo,This Entertainer certainly SURPRISED me!,7,12 April 2013,"On a scale for entertainment alone, the new G.I. Joe movie gets bonus points from me. I liked the first one, yet at the same time it let me down. It was too sci-fi and less military. This new movie adds a better balance between the sci-fi and the realistic (thats my perspective). This movie was in retaliation to the first one. The action scenes were solid, they exceeded my expectations. For example, the fight scenes between Shadow and Snake-eyes never lasted very long and the fighting between them was bland and generic. In this new movie, the fight between them was so much cooler and much more pleasing, especially to the eye. The acting was great for what some would call a ""no-brainer"" movie. The story and plot was simple yet entertaining. And honestly, some elements to the story I didn't expect - but they weren't exactly what you would call twists or anything like that. I know that there are a lot of mixed reviews. But, you should know that Retaliation feels a lot different than the first one. Its not quite as cheesy and the acting is better, and it didn't have any romance driven sub-plots. Entertainment Level: High (8/10) Acting Level: Great (7/10) Story/plot: good (6.5/10) Visual effects/sound/: High (8/10)Overall, great movie (7/10) I could watch this movie several times and enjoy it every time.",G.I.

148,tuhin94,"Not all that you would want out of it, but damn, those visuals are good.",6,24 September 2013,"I have never been a super nerd about G.I. Joe. I never wanted to buy those action figures because I thought, ""Why spend money buying simply soldiers with weapons when there is stuff like Halo and Star Wars?"" It all seemed too civilized. But the movies have made it more than that (although, the first seems so long ago). Of course, being an action film with a cast filled with big names, the delivery was bound to be good. And why would a big name actor sign the contract for a film with sub par special effects? On both fronts, G.I. Joe Retaliation is a success. Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow again make many a memorable fight scene with their sword (and gun) play. The Rock and Channing provide great laughs and plenty of bad-assery. But, for the duration, one has a constant feeling that they are watching something devoid of substance sort of like that guy who only talks about hedonistic things like alcohol and women. And there were a lot of weird things. For one, how did computers suddenly show up at the abandoned rec center that the 3 remaining Joes made camp in? And how did Firefly's injuries from being rammed multiple times by a pickup not last him more than a few days in the movie time line? Even with all that, the producers included something quite epic that is not scene very frequently: they completely demolished a major city. Yes, London was decimated by the hands of the bad guys. Finally, some major losses for the good humans. All that suspense was not for naught. Overall, it /could have been better, but a decent watch. Watched 07/22/2013, written 09/25-09/24/2013.",G.I.

149,thenekassyni,Not a good movie....,3,1 April 2013,"This was one of the few movies in my life time that I have blurted out WTF numerous times. This is because some of the things in the movie are just so ridiculous and incoherent that it's the only expression to make.Before the details I'll highlight in general the bad.1. Bad scrip, story, plot 2. Poor character and lack-thereof 3. Ridiculous actions scenes 4. Poor acting but mostly due to scriptTh script and plot of the movie is stupid. Script is meant for 10 year olds or maybe less. You're brain will hurt if you try to figure things out. For instance, when you first hear the rock tell everyone ""he's the only one I trust..."" and then later on says the same thing but for different people you just wanna run out the theater screaming.I'm pretty sure there's a bug in the movie when Flint had Shadow at gunpoint in the gym and there was like this brief glimpse of Chantum's face that popped up. I'm not sure if it was meant as a flashback, remembrance or what but it didn't fit into the scene at all. To me it felt like it was a 1sec clip that didn't get cut.The characters are lacking and even more so they are stupid aside from Snakeeyes, but then he does talk. Lady Jane's character sucks pretty bad. Her characters hates being stereotype as female yet throughout the movie she defies her own standards. Hell, she even dressed up as a hot reporter to seduce the audience. And yet you see her complaining that she is being treated like a secretary because she's s woman? Give me a break...terrible script.Rock is OK but at the beginning you don't know who's in charge. Is it Duke or Roadblock? It's suppose to be Duke be his character is so absurd and weak its laughable. In some sense it's great that he's dead and Roadblock is now leader. No more confusion.The plot is totally dumb. They have the nuke satellites. They didn't need Cobra commander, no one. They didn't even need to kill anyone to do so. And then you have to ask yourself why nuke a world where you want domination? You want domination over radiated infested world? How did they get those HUGE satellites up there without anyone knowing. Where are the high tech stuffs with GI JOE? Where is there base? Last but not least how the F--- did they go boom on themselves at the end of the movie. Sure I understand that it was stopped near the launch and there might have been no going back after activation but...anyways STUPID. It's like the Joe's didn't have anything to counter so they just blow up the satellites for the hell of it to end the movie. So dumb.The fast moving tank the Roadblock used at the end. Sure it can take hits but it surely can't take the pressure of being hit with the mass it has. And all that jumping with loose wheels...seriously?I could go on and on but to sum everything up this movie blows hard for me. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and would recommend they stay the hell away from it and save their money. I advise you to do the same.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
150,adhipar,Cheesy and Average Joe,6,2 April 2013,"In the first installment, GI Joe is a group of super soldier fight super mercenaries. This 2nd installment, it's about a bunch of soldiers trying to save the world and USA President. What makes these soldiers special? Actually almost nothing. Everything seems so simple, the plot, the dialogue, even I find the ninja revenging his master' plot is hard to believe and after the credit rolls, makes me wonder why we need a special forces named GI Joe or another prequel/sequel for this franchise.OK, I don't mean all are bad, The ninja's fight in the mountain is cool, but the rest well, just OK. I mean, the action supposed to be getting more complex, more awesome towards the end of the movie, but that didn't happen with this movie.

As as result of my frequent attendance, I have come to know not to expect much from action blockbuster films. Yes, you get your usual incomprehensible hand-to-hand fights, buildings exploding and enemy gunfire as inaccurate as ever, with the inevitably minimal plot and screenplay. As the ending credits rolled, I stood up thinking ""ehhh"". The film definitely had some amazingly entertaining action sequences and awesome special effects, but you know, you can't really be THAT amazed with an action film. Not gonna lie, the screenplay in this film was pretty well written, and it included quite a few pleasantly surprising laughs. Dwayne Johnson has a big few months ahead of him with the release of Snitch (which I give a 7/10), the next Fast and Furious movie, and Pain & Gain. With this film, he did reinforce his true acting credentials, even though not much notable acting is observed in such a genre. All in all, if you're expecting something like Olympus Has Fallen, you might be dissatisfied.

It is a simple scifi action movie with lots of shootings, fights and other topics from the action genre. It is not a very good movie, but it surely make the fans of the genre and of the original characters have a good time. The pace of the second part is faster and fluider than the one of ""G. I. Joe: the rise of Cobra"". The action scenes are well executed and in spite of its predictability, I did not find it boring. Some spectators will be disappointed because Bruce Willis and Channing Tattum are not the real protagonists and are on screen less time than expected, specially the second one. The real protagonist actor is The Rock. Jonathan Pryce does a good job playing the role of the President as well as the President's impostor. The rest of the cast does a decent job, but this script does not demand too good interpretations due to its lack of depth. The special effects are very good. In conclusion, this movie's weak points are its predictability, lack of charismatic character, the short apparitions of both Willis and Tattum and the lack of depth whereas the strong points of the movie are its fast pace and the last thirty minutes.",G.I.

In fact if you liked the first film, then stay away from this totally. For it will put you off the first one, as well as put you off the actors that starred in it.Thank goodness the worst actors get quick exits from the movie early on. Homemade PC effects, terrible weapons, fancy dress party costumes. It is like they went back in time in terms of technology/looks, in comparison to the first film.Terrible acting all round, unbelievable cliché rubbish through and through. The rock should have been the captain from the beginning he actually played the part well and way better than I expected.This film is so bad that if I had any enemies, i would not even recommend it to them. Using the DVD as an ashtray and it's cover to wipe my bottom with, would be too good for this title.Summary: If you are mega mega mega desperate to watch something new and have seen everything else than this film may fill your void.

That's all what I enjoyed of this movie. The story it's simply childish, How they solve important moments are ridiculous, some example: cobra leader stays years in a maximum security prison since a new prisoner arrive an let escape everyone after 10 minutes he just step in, they solve that the president of united stated is an impostor analyzing his body movement with a computer in 2 minutes, they cut with swords bullets shots by gun and machine-gun...if you can enjoy all that this is your film.

I am willing to challenge that claim but first let's look at G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra. I didn't like it. It was just a sloppy messy of bland and okay material. However it's sequel I will say is far superior. It is a mindless action film in the same vein as a Michael Bay movie with a interesting yet dumb plot. I think one of the best parts of the film is that it really tries to separate itself from the first one as much as possible without blatantly disregarding the story.

And the fact that Cobra Commander was his friend makes it more crucial for him to be there. I was hoping that in the end they would reveal he survived but alas that didn't happen. I was hoping for something like in X-Men Last Stand when Charles Xavier whom was believed to have died entered the body of a comatose man. But Cobra Commander got away. Maybe if they make another one they can bring him back and I hope they do. Maybe they can bring him back as Duke's brother, Falcon. I also miss the character of Scarlett.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
158,thedudeabides-2,As bad as you would expect,4,31 July 2014,"The Transformers franchise has a lot to answer for. Not only has it prolonged Michael Bay's awful career, but it also convinced Hollywood that a toy brand can successfully carry a big screen blockbuster, leading to an uninspired G.I Joe movie which was successful enough to warrant a slightly better sequel.Anyone who has seen the original will know exactly what to expect from G.I. Joe: Retaliation; a paper thin plot, some highly questionable acting and a few action set pieces sprinkled throughout. The story picks up from the first, with the Joes acting as a defence force for the US government. Naturally, this proves to be a problem for Cobra: a group of villains who happens to be the Joes' arch enemy, who decides to eradicate them in an early set piece which contains the only surprise of the movie. The rest of the movie follows Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, as he leads the remaining Joes on a mission to clear their name and bring down Cobra. Not only has this been done a million times before, it has also been done a million times better. Johnson, to his credit, does the best he can with a script peppered with flat jokes and macho posturing and the movie's major selling point, Bruce Willis, is essentially an extended cameo with no redeeming quality whatsoever. It's not all bad; there is a wonderful joke right at the beginning between Johnson and Channing Tatum, and a sequence which occurs halfway through, involving the mute Snake Eyes' rescue/kidnap of Storm Shadow is easily the most enjoyable part of the whole movie. Unfortunately, these instances are few and far between, and for the rest of the time you will be scratching your head wondering why this was deemed necessary in the first place.A slight improvement on the original which is not saying much. This is cynical Hollywood movie making at its worst. Bruce Willis phones it in, the script is a lame duck and most of the action is uninspired. Play with the toy instead, you will have more fun.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
159,zach-tiefling,"Guilty Pleasure, if you leave your brain at the door",6,25 August 2013,"I have seen the first movie and as I went into this one, I expected something really terrible. I was prepared to see a mindless piece of Hollywood-Goo, where someone had pulled an 80s-Franchise (for a second time) out of the bin and made a movie from whatever property he grabbed. ...I got what I expected, but I was also pleasantly surprised. Not that the movie is good, oh gawd no. But if you leave your brain at the door, you can have a lot of fun with this one. It is the second G.I. Joe movie, a franchise based a cartoon (based on a toy-line), in which the evil COBRA Organization tries to take over the world. So if you expect anything even slightly deep, you will be disappointed.I also have the impression, that this movie itself is terribly aware of what it is: The adaptation of a cartoon. It is filmed in bright colors, has over the top action scenes, gizmos, weapons and other stuff. It is the kind of stuff, which is cool to look at, but if you think about it for too long you notice how stupid all of it is. This movie does not bother at all to explain some transitions and bits: How did the Joes manage to get into that highly secured location? What exactly is the point of those two Joes killing bad guys? Where did they get their equipment form? Would Cobra Commanders plan work in real life? It doesn't matter to the movie and neither did it matter to me. There are plot-holes the size of Belgium in this movie, but I couldn't care less. Just shove some more action in there, I am not here to strain my brain. In the end I see this movie more than a homage than everything else. Nearly every action movie cliché is pulled and I for some reason really liked it.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

I am somewhat used to seeing a well rated movie and finding out it sucked, but NEVER have I seen a poorly rated movie and thought it was good.I mean 5.9? Seriously!? Anything in the 5's on IMDb is just terrible. So many reviews rate this a 1 star, and I expected a bad movie going into it. But it was absolutely fine! First of all, the plot. Many people are ripping on it saying it was terrible. I am not an easy person to satisfy in terms of 'wow this just doesn't make sense' and that really takes me out of the movie, but this plot was about as good as I could expect from a GI Joe movie.All Joes are eliminated because there is an imposter president...OK great, very interesting premise. We find out it's zartan, again, great...it's a big enemy of the Joes. The 3 Joes left manage to mount an investigation, they solve the whole Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes thing, and there are plenty interesting twists.For example, when the president launches the nukes, and all the other countries are shocked...that was a brilliant move! So he self destructs and they all have to follow suit. A weapon system designed around gravity delivering a huge rod into the ground? Also brilliant. No fallout.Even the scene where Bruce Willis falls down the stairs looking like a cobra agent, just to turn and shoot the other two...brilliant!And for people complaining about Channing Tatum dying early, I mean come on... it just shows how serious the movie is. They ACTUALLY killed the captain. They also ACTUALLY blew up London. How many movies do you sit through thinking...well who cares what happens, they won't actually do anything. This was well thought out, and contained all the action one could possibly handle. I found myself engaged throughout, and wondering how they were going to end up stopping the commander. Also, all the special effects were great! There was only like 1 or 2 times where I felt they over did it, other than that it was great quality.The only things that I could see being annoying to people is that A)you are a die hard GI Joe fan and things didn't follow the story you wanted (including continuation from first movie) B)you saw this movie for Channing Tatum (whose death was a necessary set up) C) you just don't like action movies.Seriously, I think they really did great on this sequel, and while 8 is possibly a bit high (I would really give it a 7), I just have to do something to balance out the ridiculous 5.9 this has right now.",G.I.

162,tvmovienews,G.I. Joe: Retaliation,6,5 August 2013,"G.I. Joe: Retaliation is the sequel to G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra, which is based on Hansbro's toy, comic and media franchise. This is directed by Jon M. Chu and written by the Zombieland writers, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who help bring some humor to the series. In this installment, the G.I. Joe's are framed for stealing nuclear warheads from Pakistan by rival Cobra member 'Zartan', who is impersonating the President of the United States. The Joe's set out to clear their names, and stop the Cobra faction from completing their evil plot against the world. So as you can see, like most action films it doesn't exactly possess the deepest storyline going around. My knowledge of the comic series is quite limited so I couldn't help myself researching the characters featured in the film. In a nutshell, there are two rival groups; the 'G.I. Joe's' who are the good guys, and 'Cobra' who are the bad guys. Most of the characters have cool names like Roadblock, Firefly and Snake Eyes, and seem to have a special skill set. It really reminded me of a mix of 'X-Men' and 'Mortal Kombat', meets 'The Expendables'. Several actors reprise their roles from the first film, such as Channing Tatum, Arnold Vosloo, Ray Park, Jonathan Pryce, and Byung-hun Lee. You may recognise Ray Park as 'Darth Maul' in 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace', so you would be aware that he is a pretty incredible Martial Artist. Joining the cast is Dwayne Johnson (The Rock), Ray Stevenson and Bruce Willis. I always knew Dwayne Johnson was ripped, but my god, is he massive in this film! He makes Channing Tatum and Bruce Willis look like twigs next to him. Unfortunately Joseph Gordon-Levitt doesn't return in his role as Cobra Commander. Instead the character is played by Australian actor Luke Bracey. For what this is, I thought it was a really entertaining. The action never stops for a rest and ticks most boxes to satisfy fans of the genre. It's crammed with plenty of big action sequences, things blowing up, car chase scenes, crazy ninja battles, and cheesy one liners which Bruce Willis delivers in spectacular fashion. The chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Channing Tatum comes across as really natural, and you can just tell they would be mates on set.After reading reviews from G.I. Joe nerds around the world, there is an overwhelming consensus of disappointment towards major plot holes linking the first and second movie. As a casual observer, it probably didn't bother me as much and with a third film already in development, I look forward to the next ass kicking battle between the G.I. Joe's and Copbra.My Rating: 6.5/10For more Movie and TV News, Reviews and Rumours go to: www.facebook.com/tvmovienews",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
163,dmurilloroman,From The Words of Jay-Z...,7,31 March 2013,"The second installment of the G.I. Joe ends up as a worthy one. The first film, although horrid, did do one thing pretty well..it's action scenes with realistic warfare and extremely high octane. Retalliation doesn't fail in that aspect, it's humor is far more mature evolving from cheap laughs to pretty catchy and enjoyable ones. The plot of the film is pretty unoriginal but nothing big enough to wreck the experience. I saw the film in IMAX 3D which to me, really wasn't necessary due to it having pretty few instances where you'll be in ""awww"" of the use of 3D. Numerous critics bashed the film for not using The Rock to his full potential but personally he was a star in here with a sense of humor who is an over average action star who can surprisingly dish out dramatic moments. Emotionally, there is not much to talk about due to its numerous clichés but there's too few moments to really judge it. This film also shed all the fat from the fist film(unlikable characters) and added in fewer yet more quality ones. The action may be a little bit too fast paced but all is forgiven due to whole film being filled with enough quality scenes to outweigh the bad. Overall, the film is a huge improvement in every aspect and kudos to John Chu for an extremely surprising outing and his amazing work, choreographically(the ninja mountain scene).",G.I.

164,rahmannoodles22,Go Joe! Yes? No? Maybe so? - Noodles Review,5,19 December 2013,"G.I. Joe! That's always exciting, right? Well, not in this movie's predecessor The Rise of Cobra, but this sequel (that should've been a reboot to the crap we saw in 2009) has some to it. G.I. Joe: Retaliation starts with the imposter president ordering for the G.I. Joe unit to be taken out. And now, all that's left are the heroes of this movie (they don't exactly save the movie but they, more or less, save the day). Right off the bat, I can tell you that this movie is a hell of a lot better than its predecessor.Retaliation stars the Rock... Yup, pretty much just the Rock. Well there's also the really hot chick and the other guy that nobody cares about, but the movie is for Dwayne Johnson. Additionally, there's Snake Eyes doing his thing and Channing Tatum's character, Duke, who was obviously written in at the last minute to make a little bit more money. Some of these characters are very irrelevant. Snake Eyes is in this movie for the sake of being Snake Eyes, an ass-kicking ninja soldier. That's it. So, his relevance to the story is somewhat forced; I personally thought the movie could've been executed better without him (although he does have some cool action scenes). The third guy of the main squad is highly forgettable (I don't even remember his name) and I feel that Duke should've had that role; but unfortunately Duke was written in at the last minute in scenes that wouldn't alter the present story too much.As for the execution of the movie, it's actually really entertaining as just a popcorn flick. The story's not that dense but at some times, it tries to be. In the middle of the movie, it just slows down for no apparent reason. If that had aided in the storytelling, I would've been okay, but that's not the case here! The story of the movie is a little forced at times, and I just wish this movie didn't take itself as seriously as it actually did because it made the movie, itself, seem messy. Then, they throw explosions and bullets at you to make you forget about that. But, I think we all just wanna see this movie for the action and the special effects.Really, this movie is good for a G.I. Joe movie. Compared to the first movie, Retaliation is a hell of a lot better, in pretty much every sense. And because this movie is going to be compared so much to the first movie, G.I. Joe: Retaliation will seem a lot better than it actually is. As a movie itself, it's an enjoyable and cartoony popcorn movie where you can just turn your brain off and have some fun watching the action and explosions; but not really worth seeing more than once. It's a one time thing.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

This movie feels like one of those movies centered around the tired old gimmick of cartoon characters coming to the real world only it's not because they botched it so poorly.It's literally GI Joe character names pasted on a Michael Bay style standard wasteful macho action flick. If you erased any of the GI Joe names or the snake eyes costume from this, you would think it's another big name stars in credits to make back all the money spent on seizure inducing CGI Michael bay flick.

Here though, the whole setup was so pathetic, the shitty non witty banter, poor acting skills and a stupid plot, that it felt as if the movie is a parody but the actors were never told it was. I suppose if you have a different or vast sense of humor you might go ROFL if you see this one.Anyhow, coming to the action sequences, the one minute clip (officially available online) of the Snake-Eye romp on icy mountains is pretty much the best the movie has to offer, everything else can be skipped. There are also a couple of creative weapon designs (using the high melting point of Tungsten to make a comet cum missile that doesn't burn off) but I would nonetheless advise you to watch this only if you have the fast forward button close to you, very close.",G.I.

168,sonicfan5715,"Just a fun movie, nothing too phenomenal, but still fun.",7,5 April 2013,"I've never really watched the original ""G.I. Joe"" as a child, and after I saw the first film, ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra"", I wasn't all that impressed with it. After Transformers, Hasbro has just been trying to cash in on movie products based on their action figures (and I have NO intention of seeing ""Battleship"" btw), and a G.I. Joe movie was one way to do it. So now here we have a sequel, ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"". After seeing a few trailers, it seemed worth checking out, even though it resorts to the ""famous characters we all know and love betrayed and having to prove their innocence"" plot. All the same, Bruce Willis is in to.I will say that at least this and Fast Five help make up for Dwayne Johnsons ""Toothfairy"", as he plays the character Roadblock alongside his partners Duke (Channing Tatum), Flint (D.J. Contra), and a very eye-opening Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). This film does start off well enough with a mission for the G.I. Joes, and everything goes as planned, until they are suddenly obliterated, save for Roadblock, Jaye, and Flint, by order of the President of the U.S. himself. Now fugitives, the three, after suffering such as great loss including Duke (which was admittedly surprising that they killed him off so early on, but it was probably a cash in on some quick easy drama, cause a lot of us probably wouldn't have cared if Flint was the one who blew up instead), have to go and get prepared to find out why they were set up and join with Snake Eyes (admittedly the most awesome character in the film)to finish it once and for all. This is a much better film then ""Rise of Cobra"" for a few good reasons. 1. At least it has something of an entertaining plot line, not really throwing any unique curves, but how it plays out with some pretty impressive action/explosive sequences and fun character moments (though Flint isn't all that memorable of a character). And when the film is over, it leaves you satisfied with what you just sat through, and maybe making you want to check it out once more. 2.Bruce Willis. 3.Cobras redesign... SO much better then that stupid frigging' oxygen mask he had in ""Retaliation"", and looks and sounds like Cobra should, though I never watched the show, this feels like what this villain should be. And even then he's not the central issue in the film, along with a controversy of if the president is really the president and the Zeus missile threat makes this a little better than a single way plot. 4. The launching of the first Zeus missile on London, and the explosively destructive result is visually better and more satisfying then anything the awful movie ""2012"" could offer.So in the end, ""G.I. Joe Retaliation"" is no film masterpiece in the slightest, but at least I can say it was a good and very fun movie to watch, and even has quite a few elements that stand out from other films and manages to stand as a MUCH better film than Taken 2 or Wrath of the Titans. And for my money that more than enough for me to give this film a solid 7/10: awesome action scenes, explosions that put Michael Bay-Crap to shame, very funny character moments, and overall fun movie. And if an ninja fight scene alongside of a mountain with a bad a$$ Snake Eyes and little ""firefly"" drones that explode all over the place isn't enough to for you to see it... again, Bruce Willis.Final Verdict: 7/10 Review By: Jeffrey V, sonicfan5715",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
169,DangerAwesome,Contains a few glimpses of a better movie,4,12 October 2013,"""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" contains just as many action sequences as you'd expect it to, though many of them were disappointing. For a movie with no selling points other than the action, that is a huge problem.The movie contains disappointingly little of two of the characters on the movie poster: Bruce Willis and Channing Tatum. Bruce Willis gets about 5 minutes of screen time and about one full minute of an action scene. That's disappointing because the part he's in is one of the best parts of the movie in terms of action. Channing Tatum was one of the more interesting characters early on, but dies 20 minutes into the movie. You can only feel that the movie would be significantly better if Flint (Cotrona) had died instead.The biggest failing of the movie is the clunkiness of many of the action scenes. The problem is that they rarely contain a long shot to let the audience know where people are in relationship to other people. It's close up, then extreme close up, then close up again. It's hard to enjoy the action when you can't tell where things are.The one scene that isn't guilty of that problem is the best action scene in the entire movie. The zip-line fight on the Himalayas. It contains plenty of long shots and is much easier to follow and to enjoy. That scene is definitely the highlight of the movie.The film is decidedly mediocre. It contains a few glimpses of what might have been a good action flick, but as a whole it isn't very strong. If you want a good wall to wall action movie, I'd suggest the recent Star Trek series, Batman trilogy, or Traitor (2008).",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
170,maneckk-414-209658,G.I.Joe: Retaliation  Yo Joe!!!,7,31 March 2013,"G.I.Joe for me is not just a movie. It is part of our growing up culture, when my younger brother and I used to collect their action figures (some 25 years back) and recreate the battle scenes between the Joes and Cobra's army in our bedroom. Boys and their toys are inseparable even when they grow up into Men and when the first part of the series G.I.Joe: The Rise of Cobra was released, it was like a dream come true to watch our action figures doing live action on the big screen. This was another reason why I took my son to watch it with me and he gladly shared the passion.G.I.Joe: Retaliation is the second part of the series (I am hoping there would be many more in the making) and a lot of people might not share my passion but I was still in awe of the movie and the action sequences. You have to realize that when you are going to watch a movie about the most elite fighting force (as the Joes are called) in the world, action (well actually over the top action) is the only thing you can expect and don't complain about it (like most of the intelligent critics are after watching the movie). To like a movie of this genre you have to have the passion for action and love the Joes. My suggestion  don't watch it if you are not a big action fan.The first part set some incredible precedents for the sequel both in terms of technology and action sequences. The chemistry between the characters in the first part was much more visible and enjoyable and I honestly admit, this was missing in the second part. Retaliation is based more on the internal threats faced by the force from the government while trying to fight the evil and battle the deceptive forces of Cobra. The movie takes you from the deserts of Pakistan to the mountains of Tibet, from underground high security prisons to a conference of World leaders (surprisingly India is also there in the top 7 nuclear powers of the world). The story starts with the Joes being compromised on a mission in Pakistan and the daring escape of Cobra commander from a high security prison. The plot is more a continuation in the lives of G.I.Joes who fight the hardest when hit the hardest. Zartan (the master of disguise in Cobra's army) played by Arnold Vosloo is the mind behind the whole commotion and plays a pivotal role in the plot. The story is simple and the director has concentrated on the action sequences which seem to be the focus of this 3-D movie. The part where Snake Eyes kidnaps Storm Shadow from a monastery high up in the Himalayan Mountains has been brilliantly shot and the Ninjas fighting on the ropes lends an innovative touch to the whole sequence.Dwayne ""Rock"" Johnson is fast proving to be a dependable action hero and looks the part of ""RoadBlock"" in the G.I.Joe Team. Sadly, you won't see much of Channing Tatum, who plays Duke, in this one and I kept hoping for him to return. Lady Jaye makes an entry in to the G.I.Joe team played by Adrianne Palicki along with Flint played by D.J.Cotrona. Snake Eyes played by Ray Parker (though he hardly speaks or shows his face) is one of the most lovable characters (even as a kid he was my favorite and now he is my son's favorite). The chemistry between Snake Eyes & Storm Shadow played by Byung-hun Lee, his nemesis, is electric and every time they share screen space you are bound to witness mind blowing action. I missed General Hawk but we did get General Colton played by Bruce Willis who seems to be getting old but still gets the one-liners.The climax hints at the third part in the making and I hope they can better the first 2 parts in the next one. For all you G.I. Joe lovers  Yo Joe!!!",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
171,dragonmysterious,A massive improvement from its predecessor.,7,28 April 2013,"G.I Joe Retaliation was funnier than I thought it would be. The addition of Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as the original Joe was a pretty smart move. Initially, I was doubtful of watching his film in the cinemas. In the trailer, I saw Bruce Willis firing off a machine gun in the back of a lorry and I was like ""Ahh, I have to see this movie!""The movie was better than what I expected. Many action scenes. Even though Bruce Willis didn't get a lot of screen time, the parts where he was around were either cool or funny. Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock was awesome. He did a great job as Roadblock from the comics.Unlike many others that felt that the killing off of Duke(Channing Tatum's character)was bad, I felt that it was rather necessary to provide an emotional pain and allow Roadblock to have the commandeering position.However, I didn't particularly care about the other two main characters. I guess I wouldn't care if both of them got killed off halfway through. The portrayal of Cobra Commander was better here. The helmet he wore bore more resemblance to the one in the comics. I was surprised that he didn't release Destro from the other water tank (if he was even in there). Lee Byung Hun did a great job as Storm Shadow. Pretending to be Snake Eyes and getting caught so that he could break Cobra Commander out. When he spoke(In Snake Eyes's armor), I'm sure everyone got a shock since Snake Eyes wasn't supposed to be able to talk. (Still unexplained in the movie) Storm Shadow's transition from good to bad as he wanted to prove his innocence was done pretty well.The comedic elements were pretty interesting, especially the part where all the presidents were gathered in the room and forced to waste away their nuclear weapons while the fake President played Angry Birds on his phone. I didn't really feel it was ""dumb"" or ""silly"" like what others mentioned. Dumb comedy, I would say, would be one particular badly-done scene from Iron Man 3. (If you wanna know, look at my other review.)Apart from well-done action scenes and smart plots, there weren't anything too special. It did justice for the G.I Joe franchise though. I would probably expect to see a third film. A blockbuster movie? Maybe not. An extremely fun movie balancing the action and comedy well? I agree.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
172,NurgleTheUnclean,2 for being bad enough to abandon half way through.,2,9 August 2013,"I was in a mood where I could tolerate a cheesy action flick (I liked the A-Team) so I figured I could at least bear GI Joe Retaliation.I was wrong. While there was a good cast of actors who general turn in decent performances, the dialog was unbearably corny. I was constantly moaning throughout the first half of the movie. The martial arts scenes were about the only redeeming part and even those had some cheesy crap to f that up.Super lame gadgets and props. I thought the hand fence melters are just absurd, immediately going down hill, then they throw out this carbon fiber katana thing later.Ridiculous costumes, unrealistic battle scenes, lame props, terrible dialog, thin plot.

173,Jorgosch,Great Popcorn cinema!,8,13 July 2013,"I don't really care if there is a franchise behind this or if fan-boys are crying their eyes out for some character development or other but taken as an action movie G.I. Joe: Retaliation hits all the right buttons. The fight scenes are extremely well choreographed and especially the mountain scene is breathtaking - something that's not easily achieved since it's really hard to come up with new stuff these days.The Rock shows again that he can carry a movie, both physically and through his expressions. Maybe the family stuff that was thrown in could have been left out, but we get some laughs out of that as well. The script certainly doesn't hold back in that regard, the happenings with the world leaders at the summit are nothing short of hilarious (well, at least until that big pile of dust, no offence, GB).I did like the first one as well which had more goofiness but also more cool gadgets and Sci-Fi elements. Overall, this is a really solid effort, thoroughly enjoyable and something that I can recommend heartily for an evening with friends and some beers.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
174,shawneuser,When a sequel becomes a reboot...,6,31 March 2014,"I grew up in the 80s, a decade which should be forever remembered for two things- music and cartoons. Like Transformers and He-Man, I was a fan of GI Joe. I never collected the figures, but I had friends and family that did.When Transformers hit the big screen and big money was the result, it became inevitable that GI Joe would also be made into a movie, despite the obvious conundrum of being based off a child's toy and yet dealing with very adult subjects like terrorism and warfare. So, in 2009, the Rise of Cobra came out. Handicapped with not only that base conundrum, but also with the world's mood during the Great Recession more suited for the dark surrealism of the Batman reboot than for a bloodless and sometimes lighthearted cartoon- based actioner, the first GI Joe movie was not greeted well. It underperformed at the box office and with critics. The fans also seemed impossible to please. GI Joe fans didn't think it was GI Joe enough, while those who didn't know anything about GI Joe thought it was TOO much GI Joe. And so it goes.I, on the other hand, didn't see it until after this verdict had already been proclaimed. Having low to zero expectations, I found myself surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Sure, Best Picture it is not, but for a popcorn actioner I thought it provided the entertainment that it promised. I loved the gadgets. I loved the Baroness as the sexy bad ass chick, and I thought Duke and Hawk were in decent hands with Tatum and Quaid. Obviously, the producers thought differently, and GI Joe: The Retaliation is the result. Production heard the complaints of the fans and decided to be proactive about it, turning this sequel more like a reboot of the franchise. Most of the cast of the first movie were not even asked to return, and instead the keys of the franchise were essentially handed to a fresh crew led by this generation's Schwarzennager- Dwayne Johnson. Though not bereft of fancy gadgets, this movie decided to go with the more realistic gunfights and sword duels, except its tough to be too realistic when taking leads from The Matrix. Overall, the result is a movie that those who actually liked the first one largely disdain, and those who didn't like the first one find a definite improvement. Whether this results in a net gain or a net loss for the franchise is yet to be seen. As a fan of the first movie, here are the things I didn't like about this one-1. How do you kill off Duke? He is arguably the most important single GI Joe. Having a GI Joe movie without him or Hawk is akin to having a Transformers movie without Optimus Prime.2. Roadblock is no leader. I like Dwayne Johnson, but Roadblock is not the leader of the Joes and shouldn't be. Roadblock is an enforcer, the muscle. He is not a leader. 3. No Baroness. Besides what happens with Duke, the loss of the Baroness is the biggest blow to this movie. The sexy female antagonist works wonderfully in this genre. There is no one here to replace her.4. Flint sucks. Flint is the obstentious replacement for Duke, but he is an epic fail of a boring character. The movie simply doesn't have the time to provide any backstory for him or make him interesting, and it doesn't try to. 5. The movie covered too much. One would think that the destruction of the Joes and the revival of Cobra Commander from prison would be enough of a plot, but instead, we are treated with a Storm Shadow subplot and a destructive ruse to become supreme ruler by Cobra Commander. As a result, all the characters and story lines got shorted. Now, here are some of the things I LIKED about this movie.1. Adrianne Palicki as Lady Jaye is even hotter than Scarlet from ROC. She could have used a sexy bad, like the Baroness, though as an opposite. She has little to do though she is one of the only characters for whom some back story was attempted.2. The screenplay is weak for plot but fairly strong on dialogue. It is full of one-liners and most of it worked for me. Hooo-Rah.3. The Cobra Commander is far cooler in this one. Love the monstrous voice instead of the high strung Starscream voice, and I appreciate that they made him look like the cartoon again. 4. The scene at the summit is preposterous entirely, but quite hilarious. Jonathan Pryce has good fun with it, and so did I.5. GI Joe fans at least were pleased with the Storm Shadow- Snake Eyes subplot. Though I thought the cliff hanger battle was ridiculous, the solo fight within the temple was a great hand-to-hand fight scene. I give it a 6 as a balance between the disappointment of not following up the original with the credit for trying something new, some of which worked.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
175,mynameisibrahim,Arguably better than its predecessor,4,2 April 2013,"Assuming charge of directing duties from Stephen Sommers, director John M. Chu had the unenviable task of ameliorating the franchise following the much-maligned G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. Based on the line of iconic action figures from renowned manufacturers Hasbro, Retaliation was initially scheduled for release last summer. However, it was delayed several months to allow the conversion to 3D.An unconventional progression sees almost a complete overhaul of cast from its predecessor, the only juxtaposing strand being Duke (Channing Tatum) and Snake Eyes (Ray Park). The revamp is intact with other characters being discarded, an almost unprecedented feat for a direct sequel. Another remaining thread from The Rise of Cobra is the US president being replaced by an imposter, Zartan, played to perfection by Jonathan Pryce. The doppelganger orders an assault on the G.I. Joe base, managing to annihilate all but three survivors: Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Flint (DJ Cotrona) and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). Zartan also orchestrates the escape of Cobra Commander, the eternal nemesis of the Joe's. Cobra then leads a covert network of nefarious miscreants in their quest for world domination. The solitary obstacle in their grandiose scheme is the remaining Joe's.Designed primarily for merchandising and to attract the preadolescent demographic, adults may be forgiven for thinking that G.I. Joe: Retaliation is also written and directed by them. The sequel manifests a level of intelligence that may appeal to a ten year old, but the narrative may prove inane for all other age brackets. Furthermore, the reconditioned characters may test the comprehension of those not fully acquainted with the background of G.I. Joe's.In terms of performances, Dwayne Johnson exudes charisma and shows a penchant for humor. Retaliation shows Johnson right in his element. Secondly, Snake Eyes, the fan favorite from the cartoons, emanates authority despite being bereft of any dialogues. The rest of the cast, particularly the villains, are devoid of any personality. Jonathan Pryce as the Machiavellian president is the pick of the bad bunch with a few memorable quips.The action sequences, the main selling point of the movie, are well choreographed in general. One scene specifically, an exhilarating mountain peak escape, is the highlight. It illustrates an epic scale, augmented by the 3D as well. The postponement to allow the inclusion of 3D is worth its weight in gold, especially in the action scenes. The 3D elevates the action, rendering it a larger than life perception. Chu, having previously directed the Step Up series, is in his comfort zone with regards to the well-choreographed action. Unfortunately, the non- stop adrenaline fueled action leaves minimal room for the story or characters to flourish. Retaliation is laden with an overdose of action and the pacing of the movie suffers as a consequence. Perhaps it could have been more like Avengers Assemble, allowing ample time for both action and the maturity of characters as well.The screenplay is also aided by real world politics. In the original, the villains decimated the Eiffel Tower with a biochemical attack. They went one better in Retaliation with the wholesale obliteration of the city of London. It also serves as a tribute to the resilience of USA, something which has been delineated ad nauseam in recent years. All in all, the movie offers a myopic and partisan perspective of America and the rest of the world.In conclusion, Retaliation is arguably better than its antecessor. It is essentially a representation of a child's imagination running wild, brimming with an incoherent plot and mindless action. It may invoke nostalgia for G.I. Joe enthusiasts or even prove fun fare for some viewers but sadly, it is tantamount to nothing more than your average Joe.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
176,tombiddy87,Non stop action at the cost of a poor plot,5,23 September 2013,"This sequel to 'Rise of the Cobra' may satisfy the most avid GI Joe but a loose and inconsistent plot makes 'GI Joe Retaliation' less then memorable. Even with the addition of Dwayne Johnson (AKA-The Rock) and relies deeply on the non stop action to keep the audience's attention. The Joes are forced to go into hiding when Zartan(Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President announces in a broadcast that they have stolen nuclear warheads from Pakistan. What's more Storm Shadow is once again at large and plans to rescue Cobra Commander from a underground prison. It was sad to see most cast did not return but it would be harsh to question the new casts acting abilities for the script does not give anyone a chance to give a in depth or emotional performance. Dwayne Johnson is in his element as he portrays Roadblock. Bruce Willis also joins the cast and plays General Joseph Colton who assists the team with their mission. This film is clearly here to entertain rather then give us a compelling plot and if nothing else it achieves that goal.

Is so low, that even action fans, even die hard action fans...don't believe anymore and definitely don't go to cinema for a 2nd round. Let's not compare it to the other action movies, let's compare it with the first one. The first one, although a childish action story, the way the line of events were presented...it was way better. Even acting was better. For me, but maybe it's just me, although I think Channing Tatum is not an experienced actor just because you can tell he's acting in almost his every movie, in the first movie he acted OK I could say and now they made a bad move to remove him from the show. Dwayne is big, is acting OK but he lacks the nerve, the motivation....I don't know, maybe because he has enough and don't aspire to more fame/money. Bruce is OK, but hey, he has enough...he's not interesting anymore and I guess he doesn't have the health to keep up (anyway, his job here was more like back-office) The 20 min. action in the end proves once more the budget is so low, no big investments and financial crisis fingerprint everywhere. Studious don't have good writers anymore, don't invest in special effects like they used to and go with the cheaper companies or something, actors have too much and don't act like they used to, lack of motivation....no wonder people are starting to get bored and lose their interest in cinema!

Joe Retaliation is a sequel to a movie that is based on another Hasbro Toy Brand.And speaking of Hasbro, I just find this one to be the worse of the Hasbro movies such as Transformers and Battleship. There is nothing intelligent about Retaliation. One-dimensional characters we know nothing about, blatant Product placement, ""Rule the World"" villains, and dumb political stereotypes.This movie is simply one big advertisement for the toys which I do not mind.

179,bigjackfilms,Way Better Than The First Film! A Fun Action Popcorn Flick To Sell Toys!,7,4 April 2014,"BACK STORY - Considered to be one of the greatest American cartoons of the 80s, GI Joe told the story of an American army of super soldiers battling the notorious Cobra, a ruthless terrorist organization determined to rule the world. What made the franchise popular over the years was not only the show itself, but from the enormous toy line. Every kid tried to get their hands on the entire collection of figures. The only folks I know who got em all are the Fine Brothers, and they made a movie outta it called GI Joe: The Epic Saga. I would highly recommend the film for its ridiculousness and hilarity.So with the franchise being a hit, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood would make a live action feature film. The first film was called GI Joe: The Rise Of Cobra and it was okay, nothing special. It did feel like a complete snore fest which is why I vegly remember it.REVIEW - So after the boring Rise Of Cobra, a sequel was made 4 years later. And how does this sequel hold up? Well I will say its 100% better than the first one. It was action packed, exciting and a pretty damn good popcorn flick.CHARACTERS - Allot of the characters are great. I'm really appreciating The Rock as an action actor. His character deals with emotions of loss and during allot of the action scenes, you can see he's going to show no mercy on his adversary's. Duke, while only being in the movie for the first 10 minutes, is a good character. Him and The Rock have good chemistry and it is kind of bumming of his passing. Although this isn't the first time he dies in a GI Joe movie. Lady Jaye and Bruce Willis are good, but nothing special, though Bruce Willis gets a few extra bad ass points for getting some good lines action scenes and, well being Bruce Willis. Snake Eyes is one of the better characters. I like how they continued the story line with him and Storm Shadow. By the way Storm Shadow was great too and in the ending battle it's great to see the two characters overcoming their differences and fighting together. I love that cliché when enemies become friends. Zartan as the President is okay but nothing special. I really would have preferred if he looked like his original action figure. However the best character in the movie believe it or not is Cobra Commander. He is just a bad ass when on screen. His suit is a great update to the cartoon version, way better than the first movie. Why do heroes and villains now a day look so epicly awesome in black leather? Either way, I would love to have Cobra Commanders costume.STORY & STRUCTURE - The story is very solid; it's just simply an episode of the cartoon. It also deals with the missile crisis going on right now and there was a good laugh whenever North Korea was brought up. Plus the action scenes are great, especially the Mountain sequence. It looks like they shot it for real. I'll admit I had a little vertigo. Sadly I did not see the film in 3D, but from what I saw on the screen, it looked like it would have been cool to see.OVERALL - GI Joe: Retaliation is a fun action packed popcorn flick. The Characters are awesome, the story is strait forward and the action is great. It was more of an adaptation of the cartoon than the first movie. I'd say check it out.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
180,The_Eighth_Passenger,A mess of a plot and big stupid action but still pretty entertaining,5,15 May 2013,"I was very surprised to hear that a G.I. Joe sequel was in the pipeline after the lackluster performance of the first and expectations were set to low after the studio delayed release for a whole year in order to carry out reshoots. If you go into this with low expectations and a willingness to enjoy some stupid OTT action and daft one liners you should have a good enough time. I started to lose interest after about 45 minutes but still found entertainment in some of the action.The Rock is a good screen presence with enough charisma to carry the film and the supporting cast do well enough. The RZA is the only 'actor' who stinks up the scenes he appears in. Jonathan Pryce gives an over the top, flamboyant bad guy performance that makes his turn in Tomorrow Never Dies look restrained.If you are 13 then this might be the ""coolest film ever!"" until your mind wanders to something else. For everyone else it really depends on your tolerance for physics ignoring action and gung-ho attitudes. I quite like that stuff as long as it's fast paced and doesn't take itself seriously so G.I Joe 2 barely gets a pass from me. 5/10. To put that in perspective Die Hard 5 was a 2/10. G.I.

It's not gonna win any awards, there are some hilarious goofs, but for an almost comic-book- like action movie with an insanely ridiculous plot, some fun characters, great action, and that special brand of B movie humor that festers in old action movies and horror movies, it's a great 2 hours for all ages. Think of the film RED with slightly younger people- and Bruce Willis and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (yes I have to say it all): there are guns of all shapes and sizes, some incredible explosions, London is leveled (take that Dark Knight Rises, you nancy betch) and everything is so ridiculous it works. So what if there are flashbacks to Stormshadow's childhood with Zartan in his 50s? So what if the climax makes no sense? (the idea is still fantastic) ... and I liked how the main dude from the first movie died in the beginning, it upped the stakes!It's BETTER than the first one, all new cast, original story, and the crazy mountain fight was fecking ridiculousThe first one wasn't even bad.

Such a good waste of talent on a poorly scripted film. The director must also bear some of the blame for permitting the ""unrealism"" to reach staggering heights. The sword and fist fight scenes are too long and in a few cases the practised choreography is more than apparent. In other words, the moves look staged.We watched this on DVD.

183,meren,Good Flick could have been Better,7,31 July 2013,"I liked Ray Stevenson as Firefly though in the Cartoon and the Comics you never saw him without his Mask. Between the Two films they should have just taken the Scripts literally from the Comics especially the Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow Narrative. Is Scarlett Dead, in the Comics she was basically Snake Eyes woman, as Flint and Lady Jay were together. The Bad thing about the Cartoon is Duke was the Leader of the Joes when it was really Hawk, they both could have co-existed in the Cartoon earlier. Also in the Comic Duke was introduced with Road Block, so that part of the Film Made Sense, Though Channing Tatum in the Sequel looked Small and less Tough then in the Original. Retaliation was better as it explained that basically the Reason Storm Shadow joined Cobra was because he was after Zartan. But it would have made more sense for Snake Eyes to not speak because he was injured in a Helicopter accident trying to save Scarlett, and that Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow were War Buddies. It would have been nice to see Roadblock Cook a meal or something. There are so many tough Joes that could have been in the film it was pretty Cool with Bruce Willis as the Original Gi Joe, just like the Original appeared in one of the issues of the Comic. If they do make another film Serpentor needs to somehow surface or how about Kwinn the Eskimo and Dr. Venom. It also would have been interesting say Snake Eyes face was disfigured to see him infiltrate the Prison and be unmasked and everyone faint Every issue of the Marvel Comics are good Reads and have you on your toes as to what will happen.",G.I.

184,doom-ca,Great entertainment!,8,20 July 2013,"What a pleasant surprise. Setting down to view GI Joe Retaliation, I thought I would be lucky to get through 20 minutes of the movie without bailing out on it, as happen to me watching ""Olympus Has Fallen."" Fortunately, this movie offered far more than I had hoped. The directing kept the movie light hearted enough that as an audience we don't feel forced to take the movie at face value. Instead the light humor mixed in with stunning visual effects, and sound acting moved the plot line along enough to make a solid entertaining two hours of movie experience. Perhaps my low expectations walking into the movie made a difference, I simply wasn't expecting much and in turn was rewarded with good old Hollywood fun. If your looking for an awesome action suspense thriller with enough comic relief to keep it light then Joe is your movie. The over the top plot line worked for me, as I wouldn't expect anything less, similar to a Bond-esque flick. Take care and enjoy whichever movie you choose to watch.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
185,sowhatnowthennext,Disappointing,5,23 July 2019,I played with GI Joes as a child and had high hopes for this but it was disappointing. The story and action as whole. Not sure why. The movie definitely was long. The first was far better.,G.I. Joe - Retaliation
186,mindbender2302,They shouldn't have retaliated,3,12 April 2013,"I watched this in 3D. It just sucked in an extra dimension. No storyline, no depth, no character build up and no purpose. Dwayne Johnson got beat up by a pensioner. That's how stupid this movie is.Question to script writers. You capture a criminal hell bent on killing everyone everywhere. What do you do? Don't f'in put them in prison where they'll eventually break free. Just bust a cap in their heads.I watched G I Joe growing up (the cartoons), and each half an hour episode had more balls than this .Only highlight is the girl in the movie changes clothes and you get to see her in black Victoria's Secret lingerie. You can see her bubble butt. That's it.To add insult to injury the chili cheese dog I ate during the movie gave my stomach the gurgles. It was a rip-off for $5.99.$14 for the movie and $6 for runny craps. I should have spent that on a six pack. Would have been a better investment.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
187,raynaking0,Not worth buying on DVD,2,10 August 2013,"I watched the first GI Joe and loved it! This one didn't even come close. The acting was cheesy and the plot wasn't very strong. It didn't have a funny guy in it like the first one. It's like they tried to be a serious action movie and failed miserably! I'm not a fan of Bruce Willis so when he popped up on the screen I knew the movie was going to be horrible. I actually looked at my fiancé and said ""can this movie get any worse?"" And then Bruce showed up before I could even finish asking! And when Channing Tatums character was killed in the first 15 minutes that ended the whole movie! I really do like Dwayne Johnson, I've seen all his movies and really liked them (yes even the tooth fairy one ) but this one was just bad! The only reason I didn't give it a one was because like two of the action scenes weren't too bad. If you must watch it rent it from some place or borrow it from someone. Don't waste money on it.

190,MoodyB84,"Fast frantic fun, just remember to switch your brain off!",5,6 April 2013,"Well, where to start, Rise of Cobra was loud, fast but enjoyable nonsense. Retaliation is in my view louder, faster, even more ridiculous than and just as enjoyable as its predecessor. With a few provisos of course.This was never made with the intention of being Hamlet, so is there really any point in going through in any real detail exactly what is wrong with it? Not really as looking at the poster will probably tell you everything you need to know. The plot is as generic as any action film you will ever see, every character is a cardboard cut out caricature, the dialogue is embarrassingly clunky, the acting is cheesy, logic is left at home and Bruce Willis apparently has high cholesterol. There is even a quick catch up for those that have not seen the first film with some awful Top Trumps-esque introduction.All this aside (!) Retaliation is actually loud frantic fun. If you don't think about the plot, or indeed logic then the action is half decent and the pace never really stops leaving a very entertaining, but obviously forgettable 90 minutes. Every aspect of this film, including the running time, action and plot show that they know what they are making and just do not care. On the subject of logic, I do not feel it is a plot spoiler to mention that Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) is very much a part of the plot; he seriously died in Rise of Cobra yet appears here with not a single scratch, and no explanation. This is the kind of nonexistent logic we are dealing with here. This is also a very funny film, some of the dialogue and scenes are so bad it is impossible not to laugh, though predominantly at than with as you would expect. So anyone who hates Retaliation does quite frankly have only themselves to blame for watching it in the first place. A footnote: Once again the 3D adds bugger all!Basically G.I.Joe: Retaliation is exactly what it says on the tin (well, poster): Loud, frantic, nonsensical over the top forgettable nonsense but undeniably good fun if you leave your brain and logic at home and know what to expect.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
191,simplisticreviewsblogspo,Gooooooooo! Joe!,7,1 April 2013,"Review by DJ:I hate Michael Bay's Transformers franchise. I made many points as to why they are lowest common denominator fodder and a tried and true example of bad film-making alone. But to be honest, I hated it mainly because it was a tactical strike to my nostalgia. I am an 80s baby. Transformers, G.I. Joe, Thundercats, TMNT, He-Man, Voltron, M.A.S.K., DuckTales, TaleSpin, Rescue Rangers, Silverhawks, Gobots, Heathcliff, Centurions, Dino-Riders, Danger Mouse, Count Duckula, and many more shows practically raised me. Yes, looking back at them now, I can see they were cheesy. However, I still love them because they spoke to me. They spoke to ""A"" me that I wasn't fully aware of at the time. They filled in the gaps of love and companionship my family left me to fill when they were not around. They developed my entertainment pallet. They developed my right and wrong meter. They are virtually time portals to my childhood. And if they stayed that way I would be happy with that. So, if you are going to remake them...if you're going to bring them back to modern day...changing things...changing their DNA to shoehorn them into modern sensibilities...it literally hurts me. I bring up Bay here because of the financial success of his Bayformers, other studios followed suit seeing as the almighty dollar is their guiding light. Stephen Sommers (A director I can't believe I used to like) fired another Trident missile into my memories when he brought G.I. Joe to the the big screen. It was almost as if he was copying off of Bay's test in school. It was predictable, trite, comically bad entertainment. Then, it was announced that a sequel was on the horizon and it would be directed by the guy who did the Step Up films and Justin Bieber's Never Say Never. I felt like Dustin Hoffman in Outbreak. However, after seeing G.I. Joe: Retaliation I'm relieved to say that it is much BETTER than I expected. So to say it is BETTER isn't saying that it is a great film. It still has logic problems and cheesy moments and lackluster effects. But it more effectively fits the tone a G.I. Joe film should have and offer up enough fan service an old school Joe fan would want in order to be able to walk out of the theater under their own power.Let's compare apples to apples; The Expendables works because it acknowledges the performers' nostalgic roots. It gives the fans of these performers what they want. You want Arnold to say 'I'll be back'? Fine. You want someone to say yippee ki yah? There you go. You want a Van Damme spin kick? You want a bloody, bullet riddled, fire fight for ten straight minutes? We'll give you twenty. It isn't complicated to make films that are based purely on nostalgia like Transformers and G.I. Joe. This isn't The Master or Tree of Life. Keep its simple and give the people what they want. Popcorn films like these have longer legs that way. Ask Joss Whedon. Yes, Transformers made money. A crazy amount of money. But does anyone...ANYONE hold it in high regard?G.I. Joe: Retaliation is burdened by cleaning out the closet of the previous film's story-line. A terrorist group called Cobra have an operative impersonating The President and reeking havoc on the Joes and the world. A team of surviving Joes must clear their names and take down Cobra before its too late. Simple. Director Jon M. Chu seemed to have done his research on what failed in the first film and done research on the material in general. It shows in the little nuances Joe fans would notice. A faceplate for Cobra Commander, an Uzi for Snake Eyes, an Australian accent for Firefly, a blindfold for Jinx. Its those little things that show me he actually cares about the material and doesn't just want to use the property as a bridge to show off his directorial talent. It comes across that the Joes in this film seem to actually be capable soldiers with varying skills, the way the show was intended. That as apposed to the bumbling, excelerator suit wearing, dummies in the previous film. Men and women who seemed to be working for Maxwell Smart instead of the United States Armed Services.Dwayne Johnson takes the lead in this and does an solid job. Much BETTER than the laughable Marlon Wayans and the cameoing Channing Tatum. The one thing that I thought the first G.I. Joe film got right was Ray Park's Snake Eyes. Though, Sommers even tried to screw him up too by putting a mouth on a masked man who DOESN'T TALK. But I digress. He is the only thankful carry over from the first film. His action scenes with rival Storm Shadow are worth the price of admission alone. Bruce Willis is trying much more in this than he did in his own tent pole franchise and I really liked Adrianne Palicki's Lady Jaye. However, the performances aren't all roses. Jonathan Pryce is still a bit over the top as the faux President/Zartan. The ball was dropped by casting the wooden D.J. Cotrona as Flint. A character who is supposed to be the more charismatic version of Duke merely slinks by unnoticed and unremarkably through this film. And I'm not even going to get into how bad RZA is as Blind Master. I think it is the overall camaraderie of both teams that allow you to be able to dismiss the bad apples.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
192,sorednax3,Getting Better,6,14 April 2013,"I myself can say that a large chunk of my childhood was spent with GI JOE. I played with the toys, read the comics, and watched the cartoons. So imagine my disappointment at the ham-fisted disaster that was GI JOE: Rise Of Cobra.GI JOE: Retaliation however, didn't disappoint. But it didn't exhilarate either. This movie felt like both a sequel and a reboot, with only two Joes returning, Duke & Snake-Eyes. As a Joe fan, I felt they did much better with the characters. Flint was the hot-head, Lady Jay was sexy, smart, and had an interesting back story. Snake Eye's costume was much better. Storm Shadow was horribly misused in ROC, but here, in Retaliation, he is spot on. I still wish his costume was less flamboyant, but his presence on screen was much more effective than before. Firefly seemed very one dimensional in the old cartoons, but here he has personality, and a sinisterness about him that comes off well. Cobra Commander, completely unrecognizable in the first film, is fantastic here. The look is right, but gone is the silly lisping, weaselly voice made popular in the cartoons, now replaced with some good voice work. If you liked Bane's voice in the Dark Knight Rises, you'll enjoy the Commanders.Also gone are the high tech suits and the blue plasma guns,and replaced with good old fashioned bullets. Familiar vehicles such as the Water Moccasin and HISS tanks are realized for this film.To the casual audience member though, this film would come off as a convoluted, hodge-podge sequence of action scenes, loosely fitted together into something called a plot. The film juggles the introduction of six new characters, a plot about the Joes being framed and on the run, with a sub-plot continuing the back-story and dynamic of the Storm Shadow/Snake-Eyes' relationship. Then there is the plot of Cobra and their campaign for world domination, Storm Shadow joining the Joes, recruiting help from Joe Colton, and the whole Zartan/President thing.The action scenes are hit and miss. The ninja battle on the mountains is truly something to behold. However, other fight sequences are edited in such a fast pace, that your brain cannot process fast enough who is hitting who, what just happened, and where they are in relationship to each other.The ending of the film ends on a hopeful note. Much of the secondary plots and convoluted storytelling have been shed, with a simple plot being set up for the third film: Kill Cobra Commander. If a third film is made, it has only itself to blame if it fails. Retaliation did a much better job with establishing its characters and motivation for a third film than ROC did, warranting such a dramatic shift for this film. Replacing principle characters like Roadblock, Lady Jay, etc, would be film suicide at this point. While Retaliation was partially a reboot, with new characters, a new director, a different style, the third film needs to have consistency. Yes, new characters can be introduced, but the Retaliation characters need to advance as well.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
193,damonous,1st Movie was a superhero-type film; This one just a 'soldier' movie,5,31 March 2013,"First-off, I'll admit that when I was young I knew ""of"" GI Joe (and the various toys, comic books, and cartoons) but was never a huge fan. Although I probably read 1 or 2 of the Marvel GI Joe comics, the original GI Joe movie came as a (welcome) surprise to me because it was more of a 'superhero movie' (and all the good & bad baggage that comes with it) than a straight-forward 'war/solider' movie.GI Joe: Retaliation essentially turns that on its head. Certainly, there are still fantastical characters, devices, and plots, but this time out they feel pretty out-of-place. It's actually much smaller in scale (you don't get to see the Joes' secret lair this time out) and really just crunches down the set of characters SO far that most of the time you're just watching Dwayne Johnson, Adrianne Palicki & DJ Cotrona with some almost entirely-separate scenes with Ray Park (Snake Eyes) & Jinx (Elodie Yung).An example of this is how many scenes they try to show off how 'hot' Adrianne is. Yes, she's a pretty actress, and actually well cast, but it just seems so forced: like she's the only girl toy-doll to play with, whereas the prior film had 3 or 4 knockout actresses in prime roles. I'm illustrating this just because it's an example of how across-the-board, the first film had a great ENSEMBLE of characters (which is really the heart of what I think GI Joe is), and this is a bit threadbare. Roadblock (Johnson) is better than I expected, but nevertheless really fails to inject any real fun in the proceedings...something all the more noticeable for the times when Channing Tatum is on screen. Willis is better than people are giving him credit for in this film (the size of his role is relatively akin to that of Dennis Quaid's in the first film).Seeing it in IMAX 3D really is the way to go, if you're going to. They did absolutely do a fantastic 3D-conversion (so, maybe the 1 year extra wait was worth it). When the action hits (and that's most of the time), it's high intensity and high impact.Overall, I left a little disappointed. I liked where they were going with the 1st film. This one: not so much. That being said, I'd probably still be up for another outing. But, I don't think that's going to happen: for those who didn't like the 1st movie, this one (regardless of an effort to clamp-down and make it more serious) still has a lot of way over-the-top plots and events. I don't think it's going to win many of the haters over, and I think it's more-likely to alienate those who liked the original.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
194,getjono,who was fighting who?,3,17 August 2013,I've never watched a G.I Joe movie before so maybe I'm disadvantaged by not knowing the cast of characters? I have to say apart from Dwayne Johnson and his immediate entourage I was completely lost on whose side everyone with a face mask was on? There seemed a lot of ninjas in white or black - but who knows who they are fighting for. Snake eyes - he's a friend of Dwayne Johnson - or firefly who releases him?A lot of action but very disjointed in many areas. The storyline was hard to follow and on occasions completely irrational. Some big name cast so it surprised me that they would be involved in such a nonsense storyline. If anything it taught me not to view a movie by its cast members Very confusing story for a 1st time G.I viewer,G.I. Joe - Retaliation
195,bombadil-esquire,"Under-rated, if watched more than once",8,28 August 2015,"GI Joe: Retaliation is more commendable than most think.Its pace is perfect, just like its prequel; you can't go wrong with both The Rock and awesome Ninjas being in back-to-back scenes, all the action is fun and not overcut, the CGI is great, when you look closely, and the dialogue between the Cobra characters isn't all that villain-clichéd and boring. Everyone (except for perhaps Catrona) has fine acting, that shouldn't bore, and an addition of Bruce Willis into the cast was clever, even though he doesn't play a Frank Moses or Joe McClane. The high point of the cinematic aspect of the movie, the dojo-and-cliffside fights between the ninjas, is particularly well done and, when seeing it for the first time, thrilling.The only major flaw of the movie is its escape from the other prime GI Joe characters: Ripcord and Duke's wife are not hinted at all, nor is General Hawke (Dennis Quaid), which would make complete sense if he was given that in this film the Joe's are being ""disavowed"" so to speak, or undone. The fact that Tatum's character dies within the first 15 minutes of the film is not a flaw of the movie; it provides a realistic and not cheap push for the three survivor protagonists - That he appears as the main figure on of the movie's promo posters, however, is misleading.",G.I.

I mean what was Cobra doing in the entire movie!He simply moved from one place to the other ordering people to do stuff without doing anything on his own.Even towards the end, when he was trying to run away from the entire fiasco, he leaves behind the case which controlled the titanium rod launching satellites. I guess the reason behind this was to help the G.I Joes in saving the day!

198,Exeter79,Disappointlingly cheap,4,31 July 2019,"""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" was at least a nice action movie. ""Retaliation"" is a a very cheap sequel, lacking an interesting plot and with very bad actors. Dwayne Johnson throws the only convincing performance as Roadblock, whereas D.J. Controna is plain pathetic as Flint: no charisma, no personality. They could have skipped his character at all, nobody would have noticed the difference. Did the scriptwriters know that Flint is one of G.I. Joe's leaders? Adrianne Palicki is a totally forgettable Lady Jaye, whose only activity in the movie is trying to react to Joe Colton's (Bruce Willis) sexist attitude. Bruce Willis himself looks like he doesn't really understand what the heck he's doing there. Channing Tatum was so enthusiastic about his role as Duke, that he asked to be killed in the very beginning of the movie. And that's it for the G.I. Joe forces!What about Cobra? They always had pretty much one of the most memorable cast of villains ever invented, so you would expect some great rendering in a live-action movie, wouldn't you? Well, the main villain here happens to be Jonathan Pryce, who is the President of the USA... except he's not, because he's actually Zartan, the master of disguise... except we never actually see Zarthan, but always the President. Ok... and what about the rest of Cobra? There's a decent Firefly, played by Ray Stevenson, who has however not much of the original character, since Firefly is a sabouter and sneak-attack expert, not a wrestler for sure. Cobra Commander appears like five minutes, Destro and the Baroness have been discarded from the previous installation, and Storm Shadow, well, he's pretty much wasted here.You come to realize this movie is incredibly cheap when you witness Cobra's invasion... if you remember the cartoon, they had like an endless army of vehicles, on land, sea and air. In ""Retaliation"", Cobra's forces look almost laughable in numbers.All in all, this movie has the feeling of those 1980's Chuck Norris action classics, whthout however much of the fun and hype.

But??????,7,4 April 2013,i watched the previous one at first day first show and i really disappointed ....only one thing that kept me tight on the seat was SNAKE EYE..my hero...same thing happened for this movie also for first hour.....where any one can catch at-least 20 mistakes on the screen director made...for example...burning the fence and no one watched it from the top...again take cover right under light and no one watched it....and the first mission was so simple that you'll think i can do better than them....and where?? DE militarized zone of north Korea...GREAT!!! then mission in Pakistan ...that was really interesting..because of action and future weapons they used...you'll really enjoy it...and then the sudden attack on G.I.JOE'S...and death of duke...and that time i realized...Oh god!this gonna be disaster...i actually threw my ticket away...but then black eye entered on the screen and story changed for life time...last 1 and half hour are just awesome... the action on the mountain is the best action scene ever in this year.and storm shadow just rocked it.when you'll see snake eye and storm shadow fighting together against cobra..you'll gonna watch best scene from the movie...even lady jay did good job beside of her gorgeousness she really gave hell of action . But beside all of them the main leader ROCK is the best...when he come on screen his attitude was so terrified for opposite man..that he can destroy them with one slap on top of head.... All over movie was really entertaining in second half...and you'll be satisfied with the effort.. But the main problem the mistakes won't be missed by you..it's so eye catchy...and future weapons they used in this movie are looking older than previous movie weapons..those were better than this..and even in climax the most of the weapon they used are available right now in the industry....so director had to pay attention on that.... what ever..don't miss it for action ROCK AND SNAKE EYE...,G.I.

I am not sure how anyone could accuse this movie of not having a plot. The plot was great, interesting and suspenseful. I have no doubt that this could have become a very highly rated movie if it was not for how silly they made it.Cracking silly jokes and unsuccessful attempts at humor during what should have been very serious and intense scenes simply ruined the movie for me. The corny one liners and jokes killed any suspense that was building up and the main actors seemed to be goofing off rather than trying to act. I grew up with G.I Joe and remember it being very serious and all about integrity, patriotism and dedication. Some of that was displayed here but in such a non serious tone that it did not seem genuine. I will most likely still watch the movie again because the story line and special effects were great. It is something fun to watch even with its major flaws. I would love to see a remake with a more serious and ""dark"" tone.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
203,dolfan4ever13,Crap,3,1 April 2013,"OK. The movie sucked. Most of the original cast did not return and it was never explained. Another thing is, how is Zartan(President) was always able to get away and visit with Cobra Commander and never get caught? Also, how does Zartan put his own people in the place of the Secret Service? I know GI Joe is supposed to be elite, but where it the Army, Air Force, Navy or Marines through the whole thing? This movie acts as though there is no such thing. Maybe its me, but is RoadBlock enlisted? Then why would he be in charge of GI Joe when there is an officer in the group? This movie is Junk. The first movie was alright, but the producers of this movie put this out to appease the action fans, but not the true GI Joe fans. Also, I'm not racist, but did the Rock look a little more black than he usually looks? Maybe it's me.The story was not that interesting. Duke, who is the leader of GI Joe, but only a Captain was killed too early. In the comic, Flint would have been next in line for command. But this did not happen. If the remaining Joe's were being hunted, how did they make it back to the US without being spotted? The only thing good about the movie was the fighting Snake Eyes did. The white ninja somehow was reborn and that was unexplained. Lot of plot holes and not much sense. When the white ninja was taken into a Maximum Security prison, why would they keep his weapons around for him to use later? And come on, why would someone tell a person getting locked up what the layout of a prison is, and what the defenses of the location are? And why was Destro not used in the movie? They just killed him off like it was nothing. Bad bad writing. Another thing, Bruce Willis is starting to become a cameo in movies and it is starting to suck. Willis did not make any contributions to the movie other than giving the remaining Joe's some guns. STay away from this movie.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
204,DerrickLyle2004,A huge letdown.,1,31 October 2014,"Given the success of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, you would think that Hasbro and Paramount would build upon the formula, and release an exciting, high octane sequel. Unfortunately, this follow-up is horrible!The production values are inferior to the first film, and the story is full of holes. I like the actors involved in Retaliation, but the entire package is a waste. I can't take it, Retaliation is an embarrassment, and everything about it is a waste of the G.I. JOE brand. In the future, don't listen to die hard fans. People griped about Cobra Commander's appearance in Rise of Cobra; the lack of HISS tanks; and went on and on about Marlon Wayans portraying Ripcord. In Retaliation, there's no Ripcord; Cobra Commander looks like his classic appearance; and there are HISS tanks....and the film is still bad! The Cobra Troopers and Red Ninjas lack the slickness and intimidation of the Elite Vipers, Neo-Vipers, and Viper Commandos. As for the Joes, Bruce Willis does not embody the classic Joe Colton; it is essentially Willis playing a permutation of John McClain from Die Hard. Lady Jaye, Flint, and Jinx are lacking compared to Duke, Scarlett, Heavy Duty, and Ripcord. Whereas the Joe organization was super high tech in the Rise of Cobra, it is a barely elite force in Retaliation...one that apparently gets wiped out by Cobra.Whereas the Rise of Cobra is a fast-paced and fun romp, Retaliation is messy and a poor substitute. Destroying the Eiffel Tower was exciting; but wiping out the entirety of London - as witnessed in Retaliation - borders the absurd. Don't waste time renting or purchasing Retaliation. Wait for it to come on cable or digital systems for free.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
205,clarkn-nc2,So bad... But so good,6,24 January 2015,"In reality, this film definitely deserves its poor rating- 5.8 at this time. Sure, it's crap, cheesy, clichéd- but it's such a fun movie.I think of it like this- it's like that cool toy car you won at a fair when you were a kid- and you were excited to add it to your collection, but when you open it- it's made of cheap plastic and the wheels are very stiff. Nevertheless, you play with it until it breaks (which is within a few days). Whereas other films, like Mission Impossible, for example are Hot Wheels cars.That's what this film is like. The trailers were cool and action-packed, and you knew (from the first one) that it was going to be cheesy, but you got it anyway. This is a film that you would watch if you had a bunch of guys round for a drink, or if you and your dad are watching a film while the women are out. Because, feminists beware, this is a guy's film, pure and simple. Action, fights, explosions, hot gals, all the X's.So should you watch it? Yes. Take a stab at it, and laugh at it's ridiculousness afterwards. But marks my words, you'll come back to it if you're bored or just fancy a fun flick that makes no sense. 6/10 from me. If I didn't enjoy the cheesiness, it'd probably be 5. Point 8. Like it is. OK, this bit makes no sense. But neither does the film.On a final note, who cares about London anyway?",G.I.

206,coolguyjames_nz,Hot garbage,4,4 June 2020,"Solid action with some cool scenes but some stupid events and a silly story ruin it. Tatum & The Rock work well together but they kill off Duke at the start which is a bad decision. The best character and scene is Snake Eyes in the mountains, even that's a bit OTT with the cgi. Overall it's just crap and missed the mark. Next time don't kill off the best thing going for the film right at the start.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
207,Stryder-56897,"""I think I'm faster than you Snake Eyes"", ""Damn Ninjas""",8,21 November 2020,"G. I. Joe Retaliation is a soft reboot sequel to G. I. Joe Rise of Cobra which was a pretty fun action movie based off of Hasbro's action figures. This film is not directed by Stephen Sommers, instead it is directed by Jon M Chu who directed the Step Up movies which I haven't seen.The movie stars Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock who is the G. I. Joe's cook usually in the source material he is not in this movie though. Bruce Willis stars as General Joe, DJ Cotrona stars as Flint, Adrianne Palicki as Lady Jaye, among others. Actors who return from Rise of Cobra include Channing Tatum, Lee Byung Hun, Ray Park, Jonathan Pryce, and Arnold Vosloo respectively. Robert Baker and Luke Bracey star as Cobra Commander in this one replacing Joseph Gordon Levitt and I must say they both do a much better job portraying this amazing character.Dwayne Johnson is fantastic as Roadblock although that's kind of given seeing how The Rock is great in anything he is in. The other two standouts for me were Bruce Willis as General Joe and Ray Park as Snake Eyes again. Everyone else for the most part is pretty good although Channing Tatum as good as he is he acts like he's phoning it in. The action is great and well directed. So Overall this movie is an improvement over the original it gives you big dumb stupid fun which is everything you or at least I want from a G. I. Joe movie.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

209,jagmarky,"It's A No Go Joes, A No Go!",6,9 April 2013,"*Spoiler* alert for the FIRST movie which if you hadn't seen it yet you shouldn't be here anyway.*It has been four years since Gi Joe burst onto the big screen and it wasn't all that amazing, but that one was a league or two ahead of this one. The movie picks up where the first left off, well, sort of. We have Duke and Snake Eyes only returning for the Joes and most of Cobra coming back better dressed than before *cough* Cobra Commander *cough*. It is never explained why, but it works okay. Other than the lack of returning characters (which usually happens with Gi Joe), the main plot picks up with Zartan doing his Presidential duties in a Cobra sort of way and causes great problems with his power. The trailer probably already ruined this, so I won't go on to say more about the plot, but it is severely lacking. I honestly came into this movie with low expectations, but still got disappointed. It's just supposed to be a mindless action movie, but there's a problem when the action doesn't even pull through all the way. The scenes aren't particularly fun, except for the ninja fighting, but even that doesn't last long and the same goes for all of the action scenes. I'm disappointed most with the writing, although as I've said it's supposed to be just a mindless action movie, but it's not quite even on par with the usual we get. It does nothing for the characters and yeah, characters die and it never makes you feel sorry or happy when they do. Many mindless action movies accomplish this, for me at least. Story wise or at least comedy wise I was expecting a little wee bit more as the guys behind Zombieland wrote this script. I have my doubts that they even tried hard to write something worth while from what they accomplished with that movie. There are a few funny parts, but only one or two didn't get used in the trailers, and that brings me to another minus for this movie. The advertising. The trailers completely ruined the movie with the little it had going for it as they showed almost all of the action scenes to some extent and gave away the plot a little more than I would have wanted. This is the first time out of hundreds of movies that I have seen a movie be completely dimmed down with the advertising. Now, this is not to say this factored into my final rating, but it ruined my overall experience watching the film. The few good things this movie does have is the costume design. Cobra Commander, which looked terrible in the first movie, looks better than ever with his semi-old style look coming back in live action. The other characters don't look half bad themselves either. I completely loved it and costume design alone earned an extra star. This movie was originally going to be released last year, but was postponed for 3D conversion and I have to say it was a good idea. The 3D experience stopped me from going completely un-entertained. The ninja fighting scene was in particular, the best by far. Knives flying left and right at your face is a blast and I can swear someone was really throwing knives at my face as it felt like they really were. There was nothing wrong with this conversion, but I've still seen better, though. When it comes down to it, this movie had plenty of good pieces together to set up for it to be an awesome action movie for Joe fans and action buffs alike, but it never got there, or even close for that matter. It is odd as I actually think the low rating is deserved here when I usually find myself liking lower rated movies on here. This is really unfortunate as I wanted to like this film, I REALLY wanted like this film. I gave the film as many chances as it could get, but it never lived up to anything. There is really not much to this movie at all and the first surpasses it, sadly. The first had a good cast, average writing, great action scenes even with those ""bot"" suites that came out of nowhere, and great origin stories for how everyone got started. This, however doesn't have any of those nor does it capitalize on the good parts in the first. This movie may appeal more to younger boys under fifteen. I'm a young adult male myself. I would recommend you rent it on Blu-Ray when it comes out if you're still interested or curious. It surely isn't worth the ticket price. When will we finally get a good live action GI Joe film that captures the essence of past cartoons and brings new, fun material to the franchise? I don't know, maybe the announced third film will bring some redemption, but until then, ""Mission failed Joes, mission failed"". A 5.8 out of 10 - Mediocre",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
210,djkoz78,Terrible!,1,25 July 2013,"I mean I know some will disagree, but IMO this movie wasn't even good for action films. As soon as I saw Rza as the ""Old Kung Fu Master"" I checked out of the movie completely. I know that Rza is a talented music producer and hip hop artist, but his acting is GOD AWFUL. I also know he has an extensive library on Martial Arts films however this doesn't make you a Old Wise Kung Fu Martial Arts Monk Expert. Don't believe me try and sit through the Man with The Iron Fists. This is like some old Chinese monk trying to play the Hip Hop producer and rap star in a movie like Menace II Society and make it believable all bc he listens to a lot of hip hop and watches a lot BET. Just doesn't work. So for all the people who watch movies with terrible acting lots of gunfire and explosions with no plot. This maybe your kind of film. Sadly for most of us it isn't and this is a blatant and obvious attempt at making money. I guess sometimes people will put a movie on like this because they don't wanna think to much which is fine. However I found my self actually getting dumber as the film went on. Anyways I give this a 1 out of 10 this has no redeeming qualities and for all the actors in this film it was a paycheck only.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
211,unimatrix972,"""Just what the General ordered""",8,29 March 2013,"This is the sentence Beachhead used in the original series when the Joes are left with no planes, no vehicles and very little ammunition, at the same time an whole army of well armed and geared Cobra units is banging at the door. From that moment on you get a few minutes of thrilling counterattack till almost the end of the episode, this movie gives it to you almost from the beginning.The story is down to the basics of the GIJOE-Cobra conflict, Cobra wants the world and conjures up a sophisticated evil scheme to achieve it. Agents from both sides use their unique talents and skills to get the upper hand and ensure victory. this movie had everything I loved about the original GIJOE and was way better than ""The Rise of Cobra"".Again, thumbs up on including Ninja action, can never get enough of that! The special effects and props were amazing, and the costumes were wonderfully crafted.

212,markc14,"A Loud, Fun Movie with lots of action - Strongly Recommended",8,3 April 2013,"Took in this movie at a preview screening last weekend. The theater was packed. About 1/3 of the crowd was turned away.A fast-paced, blow up movie with a lot of heart. Pays homage to the brave men and women who serve in our military and weaves the Cobra threat into a plausible world framework. Standout performances by Dwayne Johnson, Channing Tatum and Jonathan Pryce. Keep your eyes peeled for the rescue scene in the Tibetan mountains - it will leave you breathless. Strongly recommended.My screening was in IMAX 3D. Not sure that the 3D added all that much to the film, but the sound effects were superb. Quite the production - it's obvious that they had the bankroll to do LOTS of physical stunts in exotic locales. The CGI was seamless and kept to a minimum. Elaborate production design and costuming featuring some actual SEAL vehicles. This one will be inspiring hordes of toys and dress-ups for the younger set. Speaking of which, for a PG-13 film, I thought it was pretty conservatively cut. No coarse language, gore or horrific violence, just one scene that's sexually suggestive. I'd class this as a PG.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

Storywise bit  disappointment, but special effects far better than previous.   Ninja battle at edge mountain are awesome, looks need high level of  training for doing like that. Last battle seems Joe overpowered Cobra  in many ways (Cobra army are so that weak like that ??) and also when  Cobra launch nuke to outer space ?

But it needs a third part to wrap it up a little more because I think cobra got destroyed but still have more plans to destroy and take over the globe cause of the plot of this film which pitted the Joes against the ultimate threat because someone stole the identity of the president and plan to make nuclear weapons t blow up the world.

215,RaidonD,Not so great considering the long wait,6,22 March 2013,"I saw this is in a special preview the other night and I was underwhelmed. Sure, Channing as Duke, Byung-Hun Lee as Storm Shadow, Arnie Vosloo as Zartan and Luke Bracey as Cobra Commander are back (his suit finally looks the way it is supposed to) Jonathan Pryce as wimpy US president as well, but this pic took an awfully long time to be developed and find a release date. Now we get Ray Park as Snake Eyes and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Roadblock (where has he been all this time?) A hold-over from last summer to add 3D effects and some extra scenes with Tatum, which they did in the beginning; unfortunately that meant some other fight scenes with Rza as Blind Master and Elodie Yung as Jinx had to be shortened to not be dragged down plot wise in the middle part of the movie, a fantastic fight (and flight) sequence in and near the mountain monastery where Storm Shadow has to be abducted to be brought up to speed about what Zartan has really been up to with Cobra. Walton Goggins turns up as Chief Warden Nigel James of an extreme underground prison facility and Bruce Willis gets a few good scenes as gun nut General Joe Colton, whose house seems to be a whole arsenal of weaponry - and wth is James Carville doing in this?? - I liked Wonder Woman Adrianne Palicki as Brenda - whoops, Jaye, but you can tell that the production as a whole struggled mightily to keep this movie to no more than a 100 minutes in edit. Scenes are set up elaborately only to be over in their entirety before you know it, in a plot which resembles the ""Renegades"" TV story line with a little James Bond from yesteryear thrown in (think ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""Moonraker""). Directed by Jon M. Chu who took over from Stephen Sommers in this sequel, the movie offers little more than some extra VFX over its predecessor. I wish I had seen a little extra of Zartan and Jinx but oh well. Somehow this franchise seems to lend itself better to TV serials and animated stuff... great live action movies don't seem to be part of it.

Even though my friend said some of the things that happened in the last movie weren't explained. The story is the president has been taken over by some bad guy. So the G.I Joe's try to stop him. Wait, did I say story? THERE IS NO STORY. It's all just random crap filled in for an hour and 30 mins. We do have some big star actors, such as Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis, but Bruce Willis doesn't get much to do. Besides the awesome quote, ''Shut up, Brenda.''. I saw this in 3D, so is it worth it to see it in 3D? It depends. If you are coming for just 3D, sure, but for the movie whole, NO. Anyway, yeah, this movie sucks.OVERALL: If you are a G.I.

217,xristosdomini,Underrated,7,9 April 2013,"First things first: this film needs to be seen (and is being reviewed) through the lens of it being a summer blockbuster. High on entertainment value, low on ""artsy-ness"". Translation: this film exists primarily as eye-candy--if you are expecting Oscar-winning writing or acting, you are watching the wrong film.Now, about the film itself... it's worth sitting through just for the cliff-sequence and the Dwayne Johnson/Ray Stevenson fight. If you watched Day After Tomorrow just to see the Empire State Building get frozen, you will not be disappointed with this GI Joe sequel. Great visuals, some eminently watchable actors (Johnson, Willis and Stevenson all punctuate the film with some enjoyable interaction) and a serious throwback to the over-the-top action style of the 90's classics. The nice thing about the GI Joe movies is that both avoid the deadly sins of Transformers by not taking themselves too seriously.Now the bad: firstly, and perhaps too obviously, this is a movie based on a line of action figures. While it defrays this largely by writing the kind of story that an 8-year-old would come up with on a Saturday afternoon, it is still a movie based on a line of action figures. Secondly, this film has it's share of laughable moments, but it is mostly due to the dialogue writing instead of the actors... on that note, thumbs up to Adrianne Palicki for being able to hold her own opposite Bruce Willis--some good chemistry there. Hope to see her in some other stuff.There are definitely worse ways to spend 2 hours and this review is probably going to catch hell... but I found this a really enjoyable film that I could just relax and have fun in.",G.I.

218,gigitravels,It was enjoyable but the first one was much better,7,30 April 2013,"I enjoyed it but basically everything about the first GI Joe (2009) was better. 2009 had better effects, better story, more spirit, more scifi'ish, MUCH more humor, even more romance.Maybe because the first movie was slapped by some hippie critics and by some viewers who expected Shakespeare with a machine gun, GI Joe Retaliation was given a bit of a different tone, but I liked the tone of the first one much more.The movie was enjoyable especially in IMAX, although you couldn't escape the feel of dry action and a bit of a tasteless story that felt like leftovers from part 1.Also, the oh so tacky Duke babysitting Roadblock's children, I mean, give me a break seriously. At least the tackiness of part 1 involved some hot chicks rather than babysitting. No offense I love children and all but you get my point.There are some breathtaking action scenes, plenty of effects and one or two good story twists (e.g. Stormshadow's story and some others). I may even go see it again if it still runs in IMAX in my town.But once again my heart stays with the 2009 movie. Now if any Power That Be's are reading this, follow up on the part 1 spirit with GI Joe 3 (I'm sure you didn't let C.C. get away for nothing hint hint) Bottom line in one line: go watch it but part 1 was better :)",G.I.

Only negatives I found to this movie were, 1. They killed of Luke (Channing Tatum) way to early in the movie, the first 10 minutes to be exact, which is kind of a let down to see. & 2. I felt that in some points, the movie got rushed, I especially felt this when it came to the ending, but hey maybe that's just me.

JOE the cartoon show since I was a kid and I was excited when Hollywood decided to make it into a real movie. The first ""G.I. JOE The Rise Of Cobra"" was action packed in every sense of the word and I wasn't sure if ""G.I. JOE Retaliation"" would be able to live up to the first one. All I have to say is I was simply amazed and impressed by G.I. JOE Retaliation and by Director Jon M. Chu's expertise. The writers of this great film Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick were simply brilliant. This movie not only had great action scenes, but the storyline was what impressed me the most – everything just fit perfectly. It was definitely way better than the first film. I also love the scenes of My City Washington, D.C. our Nations Capitol in this movie.Duke played by Channing Tatum was the lead character in the first film, but in this movie Roadblock played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson took the leading role and he played his part magnificently. Snake Eyes played by Ray Park is the coolest character in the G.I. JOE films, and his aura continued to make this film memorable. Snake Eyes' archrival Storm Shadow played by Byung-hun Lee took the leading role among the villains in this movie. Storm Shadow's character is the most important character in this film – his role pulls you emotionally into the film. The villains Cobra Commander played by Luke Bracey and Zartan played by Arnold Vosloo completely made their characters roles believable and memorable in every way. The villain Firefly played by Ray Stevenson was the new character introduced to the G.I. JOE films. He had spectacular action scenes that were very innovative and unforgettable.G.I. JOE Retaliation is the best action film so far this year. The cinematography and CGI sequences were done expertly and precise. Not only is this movie better than the first one, it's actually the #1 movie so far this year.

225,scurvy-177-885678,Generic action flick. One major fault.,3,14 June 2013,"The movie by in large, without taking in small details, is not too shabby. Its entertaining and good enough to fill your time. Now taking in to account the smaller details, there are TONS of plot-holes. So many that you may in fact not care in the end about them. For all we know, the director was trying to keep a fast pace without worrying about the small details. But, in my opinion, its the small details that make a really good movie. *here is the spoiler*So, the biggest problem I have with this movie (and honestly I can't believe no one else reviewed about this) is the London part of the story. Effectively, London was the test dummy for the bad guy's weapon. Action flicks need lots of destruction to be good, so that's fine. But, what really got me wondering is why there was no mention of it after the heroes saved the day. There were medals, honors, and prizes awarded, but no mention AT ALL of the destruction of London (some 8 million people dead). Even if they had just mentioned something in passing. But no! Bad guy kills off 8 million people and all the movie says is ""you wont get away with this"" and that's all that is mentioned about it. I can't properly express how off putting that is. As I said, there are lots of little details which make no sense. Frankly, it looks like the creators were getting lazy while making this movie. It will definitely not be a memorable movie, but it is good enough if you are just in it for the action. Good stunts, good scenery, decent acting, just horrible plot holes. 3/10 (btw, if they had done a better job with the ending by mentioning the destruction of London, even by making a joke and saying ""oops"" I would have given the movie a 5/10)",G.I.

226,antoniikirilov,Why this movie was bad,4,3 May 2013,"I went to see that movie and it really disappointed me. First of all, they removed Scarlet and Ripcord, which were one of the coolest characters. I laughed so hard at Ripcord's stupidities. And he and Scarlet have quite the chemistry going. BAM! Gone. This leads me to the next thing: Duke is dead. He was the protagonist of the first movie, and this is the character we like, we know, we care about. He was killed in the beginning. Why? In order to leave us with Dwayne Johnson and some other bunch of people, we don't know and don't care about. They left Snake Eyes, thankfully, but he was never the main character. True, he is epic, but he is not the protagonist, he is a sidekick. Secondly, Storm is good. WHAAAAAAT? In the first movie he was portrayed as an evil person, an evil ninja that killed good people. Now they tell us he didn't kill the master and he was actually misled by Zartan. OK, but he killed all these other people, why is he not held responsible for his crimes. HE blew up the Eiffel Tower for God's sake. He wasn't controlled by nanomites, so that we can excuse him. He suddenly became a good guy just because he didn't kill 1 person, whom we didn't really cared about and nobody knew about except SE. Anna ended up in prison, despite the fact that she was controlled by nanomites. Out of all the characters from the first one, the sequel only kept 3 unchanged: Snake Eyes, Destro, and Cobra Commander (Rex, or the Doctor). Half the movie I was wondering when will Duke come back. Also, the first movie had some mystery going on, some plot to destroy the world, it was original. In this movie, the big Plot was to use a Zeus satellite instead of McAllen's nanomites. This was a COMPLETE James Bond rip-off. I was like: Haven't I watched this before, oh yes, JAMES BOND! The first G.I. Joe was interesting and entertaining because it had a fairly original plot and a twist, which kept the interest. We also got interesting characters (Scarlet finished college when she was 12 yrs old), and a good protagonist. It ended up presenting an awesome villain and promised for other actions flicks to come. The second movie ruined all this, presenting stupid characters (except Frefly, he was epic), and a ripped off plot. The only thing I liked in that movie was that they grounded it. The first one was soo unrealistic, there were weird Star Wars weapons, mini submarines that fired some shock-wave torpedoes.... The raven... The nanomites were as far as one goes to make his plot interesting. We don't want a completely realistic movie, but we neither want to see an impossible scenario. Of course in this one, Storm sliced a bullet and there were those fireflies, but we can live with that.I am not a big fan of pseudo-realistic actions with the-world-is-about-to-be-destroyed plots, so I can't say I am a fan of the first one. My review on it was quite critical. But when I saw this one, I started to like the first. I give it a 4 because of Bruce Willis, otherwise, a 2 or a 3.The only way this series can be save is if Duke survived because of some nanomite magic and Anne joins the pack because she and him have chemistry, so it would work.",G.I.

227,ujjval-tota,Good sequel but the first is still the best,5,31 March 2013,"I guess the first of any series is always the best. I think the stunts were awesome. The best part of the movie is the mountain duel between Snake Eyes along with Jinx and the red ninjas. Simply awesome. The next best part of the movie is probably the gadgets, typical G.I Joe style. One would (and probably should) expect more out of the movie. Hence it is a disappointment. Another disappointment was the killing of the characters esp Duke. Final disappointment, I miss Scarlet from the 1st part. Of course, missed just a little not much thanks to Lady Jaye's wowww dressing sense ;-). All said and done, I would like the old characters and some new ones.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

Joes were so exciting.While the 1st movie itself was a bit of a let down I thought about giving the 2nd movie a chance but the movie was an utter nonsenseYou kill of duke. Baroness goes missing the is no hi-tech weaponry there are some computer simulated scenes and we have frigid acting by the leads.Don't know who approved the scrip. What was the producer thinking because the director was clearly not thinking.All I want to say is if you have to watch the movie. Please do not go in with any expectations. The movie is a sheer disappointment.We missed baroness and duke and. Heir sizzling romance. Nano mites. Hi speed action sequences, technology and everything else that you would expect.",G.I.

229,edwards-404-45893,Good news or Bad news?,3,4 April 2013,"Alright as usual I'll stick to the good news first which would be the action scenes were good and special effects were also up to par for what I was expecting. Bad News the dialogue was Try Hard! Also I will admit I didn't like this movie but there really aren't many movies I do like now a days. So the story goes as follows the President of the U.S. isn't who you think he is? hmm Surprise, surprise, sounds like the current one anyhow this intruder/shape shifter of Cobra army or shall we just call a lying puppet of the NWO to make it more realistic obviously betrays the Joe's because he's really not who he says he is and tried to have them all killed. Sounds like continued war on terror to be realistic, the Joe's are then labelled as Terrorists themselves who are technically the returning veterans and retired police vets. The president then says the existing enemy ""Cobra"" is no longer our enemy and our task force/standing army, which of course can be compared to the most of all the TSA, Al CIAduh, U.N. Army all of which you can do your own research to make the connections. Finally the ending well lets just say when I was watching the movie and the topic of getting all the nukes in the world destroyed I was interested in seeing how this would be done especially since the president was really a terrorist in disguise is seemed all to good to be true and of course it was they destroy the nukes after launching them and realize there really is no chance of survival if they land on their designated targets after all there's enough to destroy the world 14 times over, so once the self destruction has been used by each nuclear warhead superpower the false president reveals this new satellite weapon system where they drop a giant steal beam onto a specific country and there's all kinds of them floating around up their of which have 2x the destruction a nuke would have without the fallout and all that's necessary in earths gravity to make this a successful terrorist act. The problem with this is a lot of these countries that have established satellites into space and space stations are talking of privatizing space literally and of course what better way to protect your new property by weaponization of space and really if you were to do this nukes would still prove useless so the obvious plan of weaponization in space is either this steal beam or rod idea which clearly has been thought about if its being used in movies or lasers which we know they have the technology to do so proof being in the HAARP weather station up in Alaska both of which are likely and proved but if I had to guess it would have to come down to cost? and its less costly to weaponize space with a weapon that has more devastation than a nuke hmmm no brainer right. Anyways yet again another potential scare tactic that is gonna be used in the near future who knows when but it'll probably be the Chinese, Russians, or U.S. that actually does it first either way it will be another reason to further enslave us by taking away our freedoms in order to keep us safe, YAY!",G.I.

If you love action packed films with little to no emotional impact that is your movie. The movie failed to convey any of the feelings that are hinted in the story. furthermore, the humor was barely there. while some scenes were great, the ensemble was just Blah. Personally I love a great story, a tear jerker at times, and definitely coherence. Unfortunately, while their were some great shot they were just that.

232,blahby123456,My take,6,3 October 2013,"I actually like this movie but there were a few things I did not like (major spoiler alert). First, I didn't like the fact that Duke died. He's a main character in the cartoons and he dies??? Second, I wish they had brought back Scarlett from the first movie. Would have been nice to see her and Lady Jaye kicking butts. Third, I did not like how Flint was portrayed in this movie. He's supposed to be third in command behind General Hawk and Duke. And they made him to be kind of inexperienced. Also, he and Lady Jaye are supposed to be a couple. Fourth, Flint should have been next in command, not Roadblock. Fifth, I didn't like that Destro was left out of the movie. He is also a main character and they didn't use him at all??? Sixth, I didn't like that Zartan and Firefly were killed. Will there be a sequel? It's kind of hard if you kill all your main characters. Seventh, I wish they had brought in more Joes. Despite all this, however, I did like the movie and at least found it entertaining.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
233,dereksbryan,Interesting Cast - But Where Are The Others?,7,24 July 2013,"I have to say upfront that I enjoyed this as an ""actioner"", my pulse was racing in all the fight scenes and the countdown climax had me on the edge of my seat. I enjoyed the characters and the cast were brilliant as well. But why call it GI Joe 2 when there is so little to connect it character-wise with the first? For sure Hasbro's characters are in there, so they have product to sell, but I wanted to continue the stories of the characters from the first movie, all of whom seem to be dead - if the ""cut and paste"" exposition at the start is to be believed. As a stand alone action movie this was very good, I loved the set pieces - many used in the trailers, unfortunately - and the locations: It is 10 years since I visited Fort Sumter, so I enjoyed seeing what it looked like here. The characters were well defined (or at least better drawn than in many of this type of movie) and the interplay between characters was fun to watch. I take issue with the need to show more of the family life just to include more scenes with Channing Tatum, but I suppose the producers wanted their money's worth. If GIJ3 does get made, please bring back the characters from #1, perhaps with those from #2?",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

Don't WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. the execs held this film back because the original competition would have blown the Joe's outta the water and they want to profit as much as possible. i felt ripped off. i will put as many bad reviews as possible everywhere i can since this was such a low budget low quality film that will possibly kill the franchise. the execs only cared about making money off of a name. because clearly the writers never saw the first film and damn sure never saw the cartoon or had any experience writing films,G.I.

236,seminole17,"Bloodless, 3D , Action Packed Fun",7,3 April 2013,"I want to preface this review by saying that I confess to being a bit of a film snob. However, in spite of this fact I like to occasionally forget the world for 2 hours and enjoy some action packed mayhem without thinking too much. In this respect I liked the new G.I. Joe movie. As a fan of the cartoon growing up I actually think the Joe movies have stayed more true to the original than Transformers. The ""Rock"" does a good job pretty much playing himself and I liked that Bruce Willis makes an appearance. I couldn't take my eyes off Adrianne Palicki (Jaye). She burns up the screen at times!! My favorite part is the action sequence where Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow square off and the part that follows on the Mountain. That was a wonderful piece of action and special effects. I liked the overall plot and I think the movie's running time was about right on for this type of film. If you want a movie that's going to have Oscar nominations and character development look elsewhere. If you want to have a fun time at the movies then go see this one. Blockbuster films are like Techno music. Not a lot to think about and sometimes that's a good thing.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
237,manishphukan11,Not that bad,7,6 July 2013,I watched the movie after i read like a dozen reviews of how bad it was. So obviously i had a very low expectation from the movie. But to my surprise i found it entertaining. It was a fun movie for a lazy Saturday afternoon. The movie gave me a feel of X-Men. The plot is a bit obvious but the action scenes were good (except a few which seemed quite impossible even for a Joe). Dwayne Johnson has really made a mark on Hollywood movies. He portrayed the character really well. But the best of them all was Snake Eyes. He played a key role in the second half of the movie. Maybe one day they can make a movie on Snake Eyes with Storm Shadows as his rival. I would really enjoy that one. Overall i would say its an OK movie.,G.I. Joe - Retaliation
238,KSwear,not as good as it could have been.,5,30 March 2013,"Now granted we are talking about a movie that is based on a series of toys and cartoons that has been around longer then most of the people watching it has been alive. And it is meant to be an action movie. But even factoring both those things in GI Joe: Retaliation was not as good as it could have or should have been. Casting wise, I liked the people they selected, but they should have brought back more of the original cast from the first movie. There were too many large holes in the story line as well as the plot. For example what happened to the rest of the Joe's from the first one? Are we to believe that everyone else just resigned or transfered from the Unit except Duke and Snakeeyes? Duke being in charge was not a surprise since that character as well as Flint was in charge of most of the missions and operations in the old cartoon. But even once Duke is gone you have Roadblock taking command and everyone regardless of rank just following along. Officers may ask for input or guidance from a Senior NCO, but never just throw their hands up and say okay you been here longer then me your in charge. Especially retired Generals or young Captains with something to prove.The other big gap was that according to the story line all the Joes in the world were in this one valley just sitting around waiting for an extraction that was really an ambush? Oddly enough the Cobra side of the story was a lot more balanced. With the exception of how Storm Shadow survived the base blowing up in the first one when we last saw him floating face down. Must have been ninja magic. It would have been nice if included Baronness some how even if they left her behind during the prison break like they did Destro saying I don't trust you and you chill out here till I am ready for you.Maybe I am too picky or expecting too much from the people that make movies. But I actually think if your going to make a movie. Make one that reaches out and grabs the people characters and a story to awe them not just flashy props, gore, and big booms. And also if you are going to do a series or sequel to a movie make sure it carries the story and not just something slapped together so you can get it into production fast. take some pride in your work people,",G.I.

239,jayendran-suresh,Worth a watch for once,7,29 March 2013,"Ever since the movie's release was postponed from last year & rumours of the reason doing rounds, it did stir up the expectation. Like one major one was Duke's extended role & re-shot of some scenes. But I must say the movie was disappointing. Duke's role ends very early as seen in last year's trailers ending a short but sweet bromance with roadblock. The movie's screenplay is kinda confusing. There is no continuation & subsequent scenes appear disjointed. Roadblock has been entertaining & bit emotional too. There are some inexplicable flashbacks that appear far from plausible. Like storm shadow , who has implicated for murdering his Master at a young age is now revisted with the real killer being zartan in disguise. I mean at that tender age, why was storm shadow chosen even before the joe's recruited snake eyes. I felt the flashback a bit awkward. So the twist here is storm shadow helps the joe's. It was interesting one. You have flashes of individual brilliance in certain scenes & sequences. But collectively the movie isn't engaging & sadly stale. All this even after a year's delay in release is all the more surprisingly annoying.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

241,bootsthecat13,A somewhat action movie,5,15 April 2013,"This was strictly an action movie, and not a really great one. Most of the action was computer generated. The script was thin at best and if you hadn't seen the first installment you could easily be lost. Within the first 20 minutes most of the original group is wiped out. And in my opinion anything interesting was wiped out with it. I am a fan of Bruce Willis in action movies, but he has a kitchen like the Mr. & Mrs. Smith movie and doesn't play up to his usual great action standard. We (unfortunately)watched this in 3D, and watching computer generated explosions where pieces of metal can float around like they are on a roller-coaster ride wasn't really that interesting, it just made me a little nauseous.

242,niallorourke321,Why the bad reviews?,9,28 April 2013,"I'll start off by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. At times it made me laugh, at times it gave me frights, there were many times when it set my pulse racing. It's an action movie, its supposed to. Not once did it make me think of how flawed western civilization really is, or put tears in my eyes, or make me appreciate living in a 21st century, western country, with plenty to eat, drink etc. Its an action movie, it's NOT supposed to. And thats where I find some of these reviews annoying. If you go to the cinema to see a movie called GI Joe: Retaliation, which is an action movie, you should only rate it accordingly. This movie easily fulfills all the criteria for a good action film, so if you want to go see an action movie, then yes, go see this. The acting isn't bad, the plot is fairly good and the visuals are incredible. But if you want to see a realistic film, one that will make you smile, sob, or think about life, do not go see this film. What this film is, is 2 hours entertainment. It will have you glued to the screen for that 2 hours (especially if you see it in 3D). I would recommend GI Joe: Retaliation to anyone from about the age of ten up, as long as you walk into the cinema or press play expecting to see a good action movie. If you do this, you will be thoroughly entertained for 2 hours. Enjoy!",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
243,rej_jim007,Good choices were not made.,4,30 July 2013,"First, of all, I've watched this film because I wanted to see what really happened to the character of Duke. After seeing him being blown up, then that's it for me.This movie should have gone better if there was a good storyline and that good storyline is the continuation of the first movie.Yeah, it's okay to introduce new characters but to kill major characters that's a big no no for me.Dwayne Johnson is a good actor but he failed to deliver in this film. The character of Flint and Lady Jaye was reduced here.The story should have gone in another direction and no major character has to die.For example, Duke and some other Joes should have survived that Cobra ambushed. Then he told Roadblock that they should split. Duke will go the Pit and find out what happened to the rest of the Joes. This storyline will set up part three. Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye will go back stateside to find out what's going on. This storyline is the movie itself.See. No harm done. But it didn't occur.How I wished the development of this film was done thoroughly. The first film was great. After seeing it, I looked for old GI Joe shows and toys. For this film, how I wished they would bring back Duke and the rest of the major characters.Ripcord doing some buddy talk and comedic scenes with Roadblock and Flint.Competition between Scarlet and Lady Jaye.Rivalry between the two generals, General Hawk and General Coulton.More Duke vs Cobra Commander and Destro.

No paycheck could've been worth showing up on a daily basis to create more horrible scenes for such a dreadful film. At some point, someone had to feel a little professional pride. I'm almost positive that Channing Tatum asked to be killed off at the beginning just so he wouldn't have to show up on the set anymore. Part 1 was pretty good . How could the sequel be this god awful?Lady Jaye was hot. Since I had to give this at least one star, that's where the star goes. I'm actually ticked at myself for watching this.

246,kaelzhang559,Not pleased,6,28 March 2013,"I am a fan of the original cartoon. The first one is OK for a movie adaptation to me, beside they TOTALLY RUINED Baroness' character. She's my favorite cartoon female villain; in the cartoon she is cunning, charming, and ruthless. She is both a brave fighter and a master of disguise. In the movie she was portrayed as some poor victim of some nanomites and lover of Duke.Glad the 2nd one didn't have her. It's more like a reboot rather than a sequel, most of the casts were changed. While I don't like some characters' portrayal in the first one, I still think they should have kept General Hawk and Scarlett. Duke died around 15 mins after the movie started. Not much plots were connected beside Zartan became the president. The style off the film also changed, beside the super orbital strike weapon Zeus, there is not much super weapons and super technology like in the first one. Roadblock is cool, Jaye is portrayed well. Flint is OK, and Bruce Wills is Bruce Wills.The first few battles are cool. Zartan's ambush, Firefly came to the rescue and the best of all, Snake Eyes and Jinx carried Storm Shadow and fight those red ninjas on Himalayas. That scene was really great to watch. At that point, I thought ""WOW this movie really has improved quite a lot."" Cobra Commander never mentioned he was Baroness' brother or his relationship with Duke in this movie. Other than that he had a better mask, better suit and better voice than last one. Sadly, Dr. Mindbender didn't show up in this one, either.I don't get why didn't they rescue Destro, maybe simply because the story writers didn't want Baroness to be involved? But shouldn't they at least carry him away? The next part of the story didn't make too much sense. I don't remember Jaye was ever a master of disguise like Baroness and Zarana, it's OK to let her to use her beauty kidnap the poker guy, but infiltrate to dance with the President without disguise when the Joes were viewed as enemies? Isn't it stupid? Also I think it's totally unnecessary, after they suspected he was an impostor, it's easy to figure out the impostor was the master of disguise, Zartan. Just like Storm Shadow figured out easily that Zartan was the one who killed his master after being captured.Well the climax, the final battle is just HORRIBLE. If it was even decent the movie would certainly be better than the first one. I don't want to talk much about the dialog between the leaders, or shoot the nuclear missiles then abort them all to make it nuclear free. The battle between the Joes and Cobra was too imbalanced. The Joes smashed the nameless minions easily, and we found out Cobra only had Commander , Zartan and Firefly, only Firefly is a good fighter, and the Joes? Roadblock, Bruce Wills, Jaye, Jinx, Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow(defected) and Flint.I was worried about this when I saw the cast list, and it happened. Couldn't they let Zarana, some Dreadnoks, the twins or Scrap-Iron in the movies? So it was one sided victory overall, only Roadblock and Firefly put up a good fight. I don't understand why did Cobra Commander gave the device to Firefly, he got a helicopter to rescue him and Firefly only had a boat.Firefly is the only cool villain in this movie, and it's quite sad, not sure why didn't he use his firefly bombs in the beginning.Overall the movie started strongly, but dropped down later, especially in the climax, I will give it 6-6.5/10.",G.I.

247,deflep318,This should be called GI JOE: RETCON 1!,6,28 March 2013,"For those of you that are not sure what retcon is, it's a short for Retroactive Continuity aka pretending facts previously known to be real are now changed and accepted as having always been truth. In this movie ChanTAT aka Magic Mike reprises his role as Duke. His best bud of all time ""Rip Cord"" has now been replaced by ""The Rock"" with no explanation. The ""Pit"" is now gone. General Hawk is gone. Most of the signature Joe's from rise of the cobra are gone. For some reason every single GI Joe gets wiped out in 10 minutes because they were set up to die. I guess every single Joe goes on every single mission. No one is sick or recovering from a wound, or was on leave. They managed to get every single one in flat desert with little cover guarding nuclear war heads waiting for extraction by common military. The Good:Bantering between Magic Mike and Rock was funny. Though it lasted about as long as a teenagers first time. Bruce Willis did his best Bruce Willis since the last time he played Bruce Willis in a movie. Which maybe rhetorical in description but accurate in explanation. Funny thing is I enjoy it when Bruce is Bruce and not trying to be overly emotional or extremely serious. Firefly was an interesting change up of character from the cannon. I liked this version of firefly and thought he was the best villain of the bunch. The Ninja Team up, was a nice throw back to some of past story cannons with a team up between snake eyes and storm shadow. Finally, Lady Jay in a red dress. The bad:To much to list but I will give my top five most atrocious. 1.GI Joe goes with a plan that allows for 63,000,000 people to die so that a plot point can be explained by the bad guy. ""Hey Storm Shadow! I know you want to kill Zartan, and you probably could do it at any time seeing how you are one of the two best assassins in the world. You have literally taken on an army of elite soldiers and won, but instead of just killing Cobra Commander and Zartan when you are on the boat with them; can you wait until the world is about to be destroyed by nuclear war heads to make your move? Now, if you really think that everyone will disarm their missiles then it's cool. You should just wait to attack Zartan after Zeus obliterates England. We hate those limey bastards anyway."" 2. Although the 10 minutes Magic Mike was in the movie was funny, he never should have been billed as starring. Was like when they said Steven Seagal starred in Executive Decision. 3. Where was Lady Jay's javelins and why didn't she have short hair? In all honesty they would have made a better story if they would have characters Flint and Lady Jay out of the movie and just recast Scarlet and Rip Cord. Then it would have made a little more sense. 4. Where the hell is the Baroness? 5. The utter lack of disregard for continuity makes my inner child cry like it just got hugged by pedobear.",G.I.

248,ben-675-453257,G.I Joe: Your almost there...,6,5 July 2013,"The prequel to Retaliation was a fairly strong film, but suffers the same basic issues as this action packed sequel, poor and patchy story line combined with a predictable and on reflection, dated script...Its such a shame. This franchise has some brilliant costume and concept design, and the CGI is at times astonishingly well put together and blends seamlessly with the action scenes. The fight choreography like the early film is again top notch, but there is an overwhelming feeling that this film doesn't quite know what it wants to be...Its often the case that we see films trying to hit too many target audiences and at some point the men in suits have had their say and a committee has got involved, and it leaves the result feeling like it lacks strong direction and identity, trying to pull too many different cinematic styles together into a mish mash that doesn't quite work.This films is by no means poor, but the fact that it is so close to being something possibly quite good makes it all the harder to stomach. Generally the assembled cast put in a reasonable performance considering most of the characters are either one dimensional or generally under developed, and with a lack luster script I think they get quite a decent performance out of it ignoring the occasional terrible cliché.Its worth a watch for the visuals, but don't expect any lasting resonance.",G.I.

249,whitekong7869,Duke Dies?..,4,18 August 2013,"I was so upset that I could not see this movie at the theaters, but now I'm mad I spent $6 to rent this from my cable service. The first 20 minutes showed a really promising on screen chemistry, between Channing Tatum and The Rock. I was misled by the commercials, which suggested that they were ditching some of the cheesy characters and replacing them with appropriate actors, such as The Rock and Bruce Willis. The macho smack talk between Channing Tatum and The Rock really worked, but leave it to a guy who directed the Justin Beiber movie (Jon Chu) to completely wreck that. The movie hinted at Tatum's Magic Mike role, when The Rock and Tatum joked about a pink thong, so perhaps Tatum had scheduling problems and had to put Magic Mike over GI Joe. Doesn't matter, because now Duke is officially dead. Destro, who is just as important to COBRA as Cobra Commander is, ""out of the band"" according to Cobra Commander, leaving Firefly in his place as #2, or is he #3? It seems Zartan has more power than Cobra Commander and was instrumental in creating Storm Shadow, by framing him as a kid, causing the rift between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. I'm 34 and grew up watching GI Joe every morning. I don't expect them to cater to people like me, but keep us in mind. They care more about marketing toys, which really wouldn't work, because they took all the high tech cool stuff away. The ninja fight scenes were alright and so was the fight, between Roadblock and Firefly(who was a marginal character in the cartoon). No Baroness either. Lady Jaye was smoking hot and her role was geared towards the male audience, but she had some good parts. Bruce Willis takes over Dennis Quaid's role, which didn't need to be replaced, but Joe HQ gets wiped out, so I guess General Hawk has to go as well. No real direction to the movie and we're expected to believe 6-7 Joes (Some are old geezers) can infiltrate the White House and get Zartan, who appears to be the real leader. I don't even want to see the 3rd. I thought the first was campy, but fun, and had a point. The only thing that can happen is COBRA bringing Cobra Kahn into the frey,",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

The movie carried out very well i should admit, but unfortunately it didn't bold well as a sequel to the original movie, ""G. I Joe: rise of cobra"". The movie lacks several characters from the original movie, Instead chose to use the movie to introduce new characters rather than focusing on the older ones which the director has chosen to kill off one by one. The movie also tends to deal with the sudden death of duke from the previous movie and how his death brings about the new upbringing of the new G. I. Joe team.

I enjoyed the special effects and felt the action was entertaining and over the top as to be expected with this genre.As my title suggests I do not recommend paying the extra to see this in 3D. I for one am an avid 3D supporter but the film clearly was not intended for 3D and be prepared to see a lot of giant out of focus back of heads protruding out of 30-40% of the screen during angle changes.As for the story line I felt it was a little weak and forced even for a G.I.

Other than that a very entertaining film, with appropriate linkage to first film of the series. I didn't watch the first one, yet I didn't feel like I was missing out on too much, to really enjoy the movie. I'm not sure if Channing Tatum's short stint in the film was adding to or taking away something from the movie.

In my opinion the first movie in the franchise gave what a ""GI JOE"" movie should deliver to audience. And despite the fact that most critics for earlier movie were about realistic elements of the movie, the elements inside the movie had an integrity with each other which is what you expect from a scifi/hero movie, and in that movie the scenario and how it is composed by director was indeed over the expectations if you think this franchise has fantastic elements in the very basic... and now i wonder how the people who criticized the earlier franchise, are gonna imply that this one is much better... The ideas are cool, actors are cool, story is unfortunately crap... There is no directing, the link between earlier franchise and this one has been grounded, only link has been minimized mostly on one man who is gone anyway...There is no integrity with the story and the elements in the movie, OK ""Joe"" idea was great but till now where was he and the big guy, Dwayne Johnson... I mean these all could be but not like this... Where are old guys...? The movie suchlike GI Joe cannot have such a limit of crew....this is GI Joe...All those Ninja stuff was good but that was the only flicker that has been made in the movie to attract audience, and it doesn't make a movie, movie...I say this is a real failure for a GI Joe after its predecessor...",G.I.

But I still hate how they trimmed almost all of the original cast, I like Ana and Scarlett, and it definitely will be more amusing if Ripcord is in this sequel. Luckily they kept Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, they are just as awesome as they were in the previous film, really enjoy the rival show of these two character.The story line is average, the plot is weird, doesn't have ups and downs, only a parallel line from beginning to the end. There is no climax in G.I Joe: Retaliation, but if you say the movie is excited at all time, it would be hard to argue.There are not much advanced and cool weapon stuffs in this sequel, probably to fit the story, I'd say it is actually kinda boring compare to the previous G.I.

One of the plus sides about this film, is that it wasn't so heavy on the campy, sci-fi tech they had in the first. In this one, they brought back the good-ol fashion guns and swords. Speaking of swords, the ninja sequences were visually great. Again, don't exactly go in, expecting this to be the greatest film ever. It's definitely not Oscar-worthy material. The plot is thin and predictable, but at least they had a lot fun with it. And so did I. The cast were all great. The Rock and Bruce Willis, both were badass and awesome! The chemistry between the characters was top-notch. Jonathan Pryce was exceptionally good actually, as the President/Zartan. I wish we had more of just Zartan. First film was horrible, but Arnold Vosloo was always and still is, pretty awesome, even as Zartan. Would have loved to see more of Arnie Vosloo. Now, Ray Stevenson blew me away! I never really got into the GI Joes when I was a kid, but FireFly is definitely one of the most badass characters ever. And Ray Stevenson was awesome as him! I love his Australian Accent he brings to the character. I know he's not really Australian, but his accent really sounded Australian. Amazing! Both fights between him and the Rock were exceptionally good, especially the 2nd one where they were at it with the pistols. Really reminded me of the gun kata from Equilibrium. Wish they kept him alive for a sequel. Definitely would've love to see more of him. Overall, if you're looking for a fun night and a fun and entertaining film with awesome actors and visually great action sequences with a half-ass thin and predictable plot and low expectations, then see this.

Also they should work on their comedy a lot because everyone doesn't feel the comedy as comedy some might find it to be a tragedy.The sound effects and 3d effects were just average.The movie needs more turns and twists of events and they didn't have as great story of the first movie.Bruce Willis was my favourite character here because he maintained his exceptional image he has in his acting profession.Also Dwayne Jhonson rocked too with his coolness.Next GI Joe movie needs a lot of improvement though.,G.I.

261,josefsalud,"Disappointing, unoriginal story minimized by duration of action events.",2,5 April 2013,"All these martial arts action is getting lame and not entertaining nowadays. Combine it with the use of guns out of this world is just dull. G.I. Joe: Retaliation boasts factors like that are ALWAYS seen in a typical 21st century action film. I've watched the movie about two weeks ago and by the end of the film I felt I wasted money. Too much events of adrenaline-pumping isn't just good unless there are thrilling moments added to it. I didn't see any of that in this movie. I'd say this film shows less talking, more action that gets dull and very predictable.The story is unoriginal and crosses reality very way off. Removing all those strong language used in the film, this is already a kids' movie. Now I've seen a lot of movies that threatens the whole world. I've been entertained by some and didn't care about some. The script is terribly messed by lots of action scenes. If there are conversations going on, I'd say, simplicity is not enough to compensate for the overwhelmingly long time of action. However, I'll give credit to unexpected humors in the movie that really pulls off. The acting of the characters were just okay but didn't really moved me; I cannot feel the emotion they are carrying.Overall, this movie is just the same as they say about its predecessor, only a slight worse.

Which country have the problem with others ?USA VS Japan USA VS UK ( in particular Nuclear Race) USA VS Russia USA VS Vietnam USA VS North Korea USA VS CUBA USA VS Afghanistan I think problem is with one country only. In this technological advancement century, countries like UK , Germany , Canada , Swiss , French etc have formed sincere relationship with other world countries .

Had they come out straight and said this was a fictional supernatural tale then maybe I would have given it 3 stars, but as it stands even 1 star is too much. Oh and this is one of the most racist movies I have ever seen. I do not understand how one can physically live in such modern times and yet mentally be in the 18th century. When they showed bullets being cut into two halves using a sword by Deadpool in X-men origins: Wolverine, it made sense as he was a mutant, but can you imagine a human being do such a thing even if he trains all his life? Well in this movie he can. It shows how just a few men can easily steal a countries Nuclear assets(even though in reality no one knows where they are) but those men cannot handle a single apache, The movie showed the arrogance and ignorance of the director time and time again with such absurdities i.e nothing is going to happen if I don't want it to happen and everything is going to happen so easily if I want it to happen.",G.I.

That's when I saw this film and I thought ""Oooh, I've seen the first one of these. It wasn't great but if this one at least matches it it'll be okay"". I should have guessed by the fact that they'd brought Bruce Willis and Dwayne Johnson into it that it was going to be an abysmal movie, because when they bring in the 'Badasses' you know they're just trying to claw in potential viewers due to the movie being bad. Okay, so here are some of my major annoyances: -Where did the rest of the original cast go?! -They killed Channing Tatum!! (Yes he's not the best actor but he way my eye candy :'( ) -It's got RZA or whatever his bloody name is in it, his terrible accent just ruined so many things... not to mention the fact that his character was just awful as well. -The Gangster Hood speak Dwayne Johnson was a part of :'( Why? Script writers, just why? -The scene with the tanks was ridiculous, Dwayne would've been blown to kingdom come if there was even the slightest bit of reality to the film at all but maybe that was just too much to hope for. -Dear lord almighty what was up with all the racial stereo types during the summit and they blew up London and no f**ker cared! -Why did the bad guys weapon have a disarm button that involved blowing up the entire satellite?!

Snake Eyes, Jinx, and the Arashikage Clan were good; but the overall premise of Retaliation failed!!!!! Those who castigated the Rise of Cobra have proved a nihilistic terrorist bunch to the G.I.

Since the CC and HISS tanks were so similar to the toy line, I'm not compelled to buy the Retaliation versions....GENIUS!!!! At least The Rise of Cobra was dynamite; this was DIM AND GRIM.

267,Ragt665,great action scenes and fights. But...,7,1 April 2013,"G. I. Joe: retaliation had its ups and downs to me. It went to action, then dialogue then action. Then they tried to slow it down. This movie felt really rushed and i expected more from it. The action was mind blowing. To me the first movie was kind of better than this one because the first movie had more variety. This movie was kind of a mess. I don't get why they put a different cast and all. They added bruce willis who acted as joe. The leader. He felt really stale and boring. He didn't have a lot of scenes. The main character (channing tatum) died really quick. He died in the beginning of this movie. The downs of this movie was the story and the variety. It felt really rushed and not only that but it had 1 year to improve some elements and to add 3d. But thats it. They rushed the character, the movie and the story.

I also liked the scenes with Bruce Willis, even thought they were mostly comedy roles it's understandable given his age.Without giving anything away, the relationship between the two brothers in this movie is provides a unique and interesting side story to the already massive plot.My only complaints with this movie are lack of character development, and some of the acting being a little to cliché.",G.I.

270,JKellam88,"Terrible follow-up to it's underrated, but far from great, predecessor",3,28 December 2013,"This sequel sees the return of very few characters from the original and this is likely due to the generally poor reviews that film received. Nevertheless, Retaliation attracted lucrative stars Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis to fill the roster. This time around, the Joes are labeled as traitors by their own government and hunted down after the President colludes with the evil terrorist organization, Cobra. Cobra is commanded by, well, Cobra Commander, of course, and the extermination of the Joes is just part of his diabolical plot. Led by Johnson's character, Roadblock, the surviving Joes regroup, recruit an old ally and hatch a plan to stop Cobra and clear their names.I am someone that can very much enjoy a simple blow-em-up movie and I understand that in these movies things like sharp dialogue, character development and good acting tend to take a back seat. However, this film just isn't exciting enough to make up for the silly plot and poor writing. First of all, the story just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It is never clear exactly what it was that Cobra Commander wanted. And why do his much more formidable subordinates seem to fear him? Before his transformation into Cobra Commander, he wasn't particularly someone of influence and he doesn't even seem too bright. All he really does is hiss orders and try his best to resemble the offspring of Darth Vader and a Gestapo officer. Also, don't all these aliases start to sound just a little silly? We have Roadblock, Snake Eyes, Destro, Storm Shadow, Jinx, and the list goes on The X-Men films handled this much better. The characters have their comic book aliases but they are mostly used as call signs on missions; in private, they refer to each other by their real names. Near the beginning of Retaliation, Cobra Commander and Destro are imprisoned and even the guards refer to them as such. There is one well-executed action sequence that involves ninjas fighting on a mountainside, but it is countered by a horrendous scene involving a nuclear weapons summit that was one of the silliest things I've seen on screen in quite some time.Jon M. Chu's directing credits include Step Up 2: The Streets, Step Up 3D, and Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. It's curious that the producers would recruit him to helm a big budget sci-fi action film. Considering the poor feedback on the first film, you would think they would have made a safer bet. I actually enjoyed this film's predecessor, The Rise of Cobra. It didn't take itself too seriously, it was much more exciting, and it was reminiscent of some of the older James Bond films, complete with futuristic gadgets and even an underwater lair. This film attempted to reduce much of the campiness that was present in the first film, but in doing so they really just removed all the fun. I have never read the G.I. Joe comic book or seen the cartoons, but I understand many fans criticized the first film for not being loyal to its source material. Perhaps they will prefer this one.Dwayne Johnson is, in my opinion, an above average action star. He's likable, relatively believable and not too over-the-top as Roadblock. Bruce Willis must be one of the busiest actors in Hollywood. He's starred in eight films in the past 15 months and has two more coming before the end of the year. Ninety percent of the time he plays the same character, but he plays that character well, including in this, although his role is not as large as the trailer would lead you to believe. Channing Tatum seemed a little detached and I think it's likely he only returned because he was contracted to appear in a sequel. Not much can be said for the most of the cast, not because they were necessarily poor actors, but because the script gave them so little to work with.If you are a lifelong G.I. Joe fan or have children in the 7-12 year range, this film may be right up your alley. If not, I suspect you will find it difficult to enjoy. There are a few entertaining action scenes and decent visual effects, but other than that I found this to be a fairly lackluster follow- up to its underrated predecessor. I could live with somewhat disappointing action scenes if there were great characters and an intriguing plot to give the film legs, but neither is found here.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

It takes of with a pace and loose it when movie progresses.It is all the old way of presenting. It never keeps you think about the plot that comes up. You can guess the story very well if you miss it a bit in the middle (if you go out to grab a popcorn).Over all ROCK looks building up his acting skills movie by movie and looks good in this. The fight sequence with the snake eyes in the middle is out standing. Action sequences adds a little spice to the dish.

272,adam-stocker,Add to List of Worst Sequels,1,31 March 2013,"After 2009, surprisingly well done Rise of Cobra, I was expecting an entertain sequel anticipating how the writers and director would tie in Zartan as President. It seems the studio decided to reboot the franchise by decided to continue parts of the previous storyline which fails horribly. The movie ends up being a mashed up, thrown together movie with little continuation of the previous storyline and muscular actors whose roles are just being muscular people with guns. The movies basic premise is around nuclear disarmament. With the GI Joe's forced to rebuild and discover the plan of Cobra before they destroy the world.The only good part of the movie is the opening where The Rock and Channing Tatum display the only enjoyable on screen chemistry of any of the actors. Unfortunately, that chemistry is blown up roughly 15 minutes in when Tatum's character is blown up. When Tatum is killed The Rock's character is upset for about two minutes. Stranded in a desert, The Rock, Lady Jaye and Flint somehow manage to make it back to America. Though how is unknown. To avoid being found, the trio hide in an abandon rec centre where they find weights and old computers from over a decade ago. Yet 5 minutes later is all upgraded to state of the art technology, in which lady Jaye is able to find videos of the present discover his commonly used phrases and hand position before and after Zartan has become President. Yes all this on 1995 technology that magically upgrades and takes her a matter of hours. Now the side plot which is equally as awful. Stormshadow who appeared to be dead at the end of the first movie somehow is alive. Stormshadow breaks Cobra commander out of prison leaving destro. But is badly burn during his escape. To recover from his burns, Stormshadow travels to the mountains where he is revived. SnakeEyes and his protégé climb the mountain drug Stormshadow to return him to the place of their training as seen in the first movie. As in the first movie they are trying Stormshadow for murdering the master. Stormshadow then proves to the council he is not guilty as it was not his sword. Back video shows it was Zartan in disgust. Stormshadow joins the Joes in fight against Cobra. Need I say more the plot is illogical leaving anyone who saw the first movie scratching their heads. Flint and Lady Jaye prove to be nothing more than eye candy for the viewer as they have very little back story and don't advance the previous story. The films ending action sequence is rushed and poorly planned out. The scene boils down to the Joes showing up little planning and no story on where the building is there are attacking.

Notably, my last experience with 'Hobbit' and 'the Dark Night' certainly confirmed their noble status as the best cinema experience in the UK... until I saw 'G.I.Joe: Retaliation'.For people who have no idea what the BFI London IMAX is: It's the biggest IMAX cinema in the UK and it only has one screen in the entire complex with less than 500 seats. The good thing is, usually their choice of films are superb so it's worth fighting for the best seats.More over, even a half descent film looks 'great' here, as long as they are half descent that is. But I realised, if you are given an absolutely rubbish film, it stays as is. That's what happened with 'G.I.Joe: Retaliation'.When my dearest friend came from Japan, I didn't hesitate to book the tickets at BFI IMAX, even though 'G.I.Joe' wasn't cup of my tea. I just assumed it'd be fun to share the experience for his souvenir to enjoy non-stop action accompanied with superior sound systems and 3D effects at the biggest IMAX cinema in the UK. Well, none of that 'IMAX experience' happened. Acting was bad, but that's not the issue. You don't expect Oscar- winning acting here. But what about action? How can anything look so incredibly flat on such a massive screen? Obviously it wasn't shot for 3D or IMAX. Or even if it was, it didn't show. Instead, all the bad CG effects are enlarged on the big screen. I didn't remotely expect the script would be good, but it would have helped if it was good, as all else have failed.I wasn't even going to waste my time to write the review about this film, and I forgot about it (almost). I feel bad about writing bad reviews, so I usually keep it to myself.But this weekend, I watched 'Star Trek Into the Darkness' at the very same cinema, with which I practically jumped up and down on my seat with the in-your-face sound systems and incredible sharp 3D effects, I suddenly felt compelled to take my time to add my view about 'G.I.Joe: Retaliation' on IMDb. Because 'Into the Darkness' was WORTH paying for the IMAX experience. Maybe I will be disappointed when I watch it again on DVD, but it doesn't matter, because at least I lived the experience.So back to 'G.I.Joe: Retaliation'. I can firmly say it was totally waste of my time and money. It was perhaps an average fun good B-movie, but never to be released as the big screen experience at BFI IMAX. You know, I want to give a benefit of doubt that I'd have enjoyed it on DVD after coming back from the pub late on Saturday night. Therefore, 3 stars.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
276,osjerick,"Not boring, but neither a good movie",4,16 July 2013,"The film feels like a episode of a series, but despite being bad, since it lacks: clever dialogs; seriousness of the characters, a plot of action that makes you seem like there is just an adaptation of a episode of the cartoon, witty humor (rather than the useless humor in it), is a movie that is not boring (maybe that explains why it have a 6 overall rating at this time). I give 5 points because I felt that I didn't wasted my time seeing it, however, I argue that it is a film with many flaws, not even close to what you would expect from an action movie, science fiction and adventure. I think that it is a good movie for the children, but for an action movie lover is a pretty bad movie.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

This is way better then the first movie and i definitely recommend it to anyone ex specially the action loving fan. There were barley any slow parts and some of the fight scenes were great!! The story was plotted out well and with the addition of a couple of new faces it all worked out good. All in all i give the story a 7/10 the action 9/10 and the special effects 8/10",G.I.

278,janishm-825-786278,Disappointing,4,28 March 2013,"After the Rise of Cobra (2009) not that it was a great movie, I expected much more as the sequel especially as it comes after fours and honestly if you may believe the first one seems much better than this one. The movie has nothing new to offer in terms of plot, which is wafer thin. The SFX do try to make up for the same. Barring, the acrobatic action sequence in the snowy mountains, nothing else held my attention in the movie.The acting is below par as expected of 'Blockbusters', but even the humor is missing. I really don't know why Bruce Willis is there and it seems clearly an after thought of having him there to add to the 'STAR' power.I watched it in IMAX 3D and really felt as I wasted my time and money, if you really want to watch this one wait for it on DVD.2 out 5...",G.I.

But before you read this , this is coming from a person who actually loved the first film ( Besides the fact that cobra looked like an idiot at the end) . I may have loved the first movie because I had never played with the action figures or seen the show. G I Joe RetaliationThe Good :Duke,The President,Stormshadow,Snake eyes and Zartan reprise their roles at least making it feel a little bit connected to the first film.The Action Sequences were very well done The Humor between RoadBlock and Duke was greatThe Bad:The fact that Duke gets killed off in the first 10 minutesAfter the first 20 minutes they go on like a half hour slow break of just talking and walking before the mountain scene.Ripcord, Baroness,Scarlett, General hawk and many other Joe's are not even mentioned making me feel like the continuity isn't really there.They throw you all these new characters like Flint that we don't even care about. The Rock and lady Jaye were cool though I must admit.RZA as the grandmaster..No...just NONot ONCE did the rock ask someone for a body massage :/Summary:All in all this movie is entertaining but it does not connect well with the characters in the previous film. Maybe they would have been better off doing a reboot",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
280,sameersingh383,An Action Packed Joy Ride!!,10,30 March 2013,I was very upset when the movie was postponed from 2012 to 2013.Now after watching this i realize that the wait was worth it.Making this movie in 3D was the right choice and a perfect choice.The action scenes in the movie are simply awesome and pace of the movie is perfect as well.The rock as Roadblock has done a tremendous job in action and acting.Although the first movie was OK but this one is so good that it makes you feel that first one never existed.The weapons used in the movie were bad ass and innovative.Bruce wills did an awesome job as usual.If your an action lover like me then you will love this movie to the core.GI Joe Retaliation is a great movie and it delivers you some great excitement. My advice to you is to watch the 3D version.,G.I. Joe - Retaliation
281,dwiberg81,G.I. Joe 2,4,14 April 2013,"I hope people realize going into this that the movie is based off an action figure/comic book. I went in with the expectations to see a lot of explosions, fighting, and that's pretty much what you get.Everything about this G.I. Joe was better than the first one. I thought the addition of The Rock and Bruce Willis was going to ruin it but they actually made the movie even better with their roles.G.I. Joe 2 was better than expected and I did have somewhat higher expectation than the first one due to the changes in director and role. I gave it 7/10. I rate my movies based on what kind of movie they are. If you compare this movie to Shawshank Redemption, I'd give G.I.Joe 2 a 3. But I'm not scoring like that. I hope other people do the same.",G.I.

282,speedx6,"Great entertainment, abit thin story",8,6 April 2013,"I wasn't going to watch this movie until one of my oldest friends ask me join them to see it. When i watched the trailer i had mixed feelings for it!The actor line-up was great, and the trailer awoken the action expectations in me to the max! But I'm not a huge fan of Action/Sci-fi movies.Well, back to buisniss...The movie itself will give you great action, humour and adrenalin kicks! It's good acting and the movie is very entertaining. Though you will find, if you pay attention to the story, a lot of holes. Im not going to spoil a whole lot to you, but there is this guy, one of the bad guys that gets kidnapped by the good guys, the good guys fights of a whole lot of soldiers, and the kidnapping couldn't be less secret... although, the bad guy, returns to the other bad guys as a ""double agent"" without any of the other bad guys questioning how he got free. It's like they didn't even know he got kidnapped...Well thats enough spoilers, but that was one example of these ""holes"".The movie is worth watching as long as you like Bruce willis and action!Have fun! - Johnny",G.I.

283,waynewcleung,What was the studio thinking to give this sequel a green light ?,1,22 April 2013,"I would keep this simple and compare the two G.I.Joe movies:G.I.Joe: Rise of Cobra --------------------------- Director's job: 4 out of 5 stars Screenplay: 3.5 out of 5 stars Casting: 5 out of 5 stars Flow of the movie: 4 out of 5 stars Action packed: 4 out of 5 stars Special effects: 4 out of 4 starsG.I.Joe: Retaliation ------------------------ Director's job : 1 out of 5 stars Screenplay: 1 out of 5 stars Casting: 3 out of 5 stars Flow of the movie: 1 out of 5 stars Action packed: 4 out of 5 stars Special effects: 4 out of 4 starsOther than the special effects and the fight sequences and Adrianne Palicki being an absolute eye candy this movie was unbearably awful. They have such a great cast (the rock, bruce willis) but still managed to mess this franchise up with bad editing bad flow and bad direction. Even if this was released on DVD it would not have saved such disgrace the director has done to this franchise. Save your money and it is definitely way too violent for kids under 12.",G.I.

284,amichaels570,"The actors don't care, the writers don't care, I certainly don't care.",1,9 May 2013,"I was absolutely disgusted with this film. It wasn't particularly offensive to any particular group (although the film's depiction of Muslims in one scene and the fact that every Asian character in the movie is a Ninja will likely raise a few eyebrows) so much as it was to its audience. The film expects the audience to believe outlandish scenes so long as there are explosions. The film is ""short""(although it feels long) but even with the film's length about 1/2 of the scenes are utterly pointless. The opening scene involves some event in a North Korean factory...that event is never mentioned again.The acting in this film was dreadful. Every actor appears to be sleeping their way through the film waiting for their next paycheck. I've seen better acting in Super Bowl advertisements than I have in this film. Granted, none of these actors are particularly talented in the first place, but this movie makes them look even worse than before. It is also painful to watch Bruce Willis lose another shred of his dignity, which is now lesser than his hair.Even the special effects were sub-par. There are a few decent explosions, but one scene in particular involving ninjas on a mountain top looks more like a video game than a feature film. The problem with the action scenes in this movie is that we don't care about the characters; they're all identical in terms of personality. If I don't care about your character, I don't care if your character lives or dies or how your character lives or dies. And if the actors don't even care, I certainly don't care.Overall, if you want a ""popcorn flick,"" you can find something far better than this.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

They never should have made DUKE's character die. WE WANT DUKE BACK. Only SNAKE EYES from 1st movie was kept alive! They didn't show what happened to other Joe's RIPCORD, SCARLET. They didn't explain how storm shadow gt away alive, while he fell down in freezing water in 1st part. But anyways to conclude good part but bit disappointing if u go to watch thinking about 1st part. Dwayne Johnson's 'Roadblock' does not have any heightened skills in martial arts or anything, he's just a big tough guy. Then there are the pretty sidekicks, who show no flair in fighting skills. The first film had this superhero version of reality where slick gadgets and physically impossible stunts sequences dazzled the screen. Again at the end WE WANT DUKE BACK. . . . .",G.I.

It felt a little low budget as well and also unrealistic for example they show every country launching their nuclear weapons and all of a sudden they are like the countries no longer have nuclear weapons well Russia and US each have 8000-10000 nuclear weapons and they showed like 20 launched. They went on to blow up London but didn't show anything else about it. I would not waste the $10-15 on this movie.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

288,zmlatoza,Disappointing.,3,29 March 2013,"It sucks that they had to put up a poster of this movie with Duke (Channing Tatum) and Joe (Bruce Willis) so grossly misleading when Duke showed up about what 10 mins or so then dies and Joe shows up when half of the movie is already finished, and not getting much burn at that (I should have known, how many of Willis's recent movies has been like this already). For an average movie goer like me (i'd like to think of myself like that) that doesn't normally go researching(goggling stuff) before watching a movie, I was sucked up by the poster itself expecting a whole lot of Duke and Joe in action. In my opinion, The Rock is not a bad actor himself but sadly he is not able to carry the movie by himself. I believe the movie producers/marketers or whoever is responsible for creating that misleading poster cheated people for their money. To be honest I am not sure I would be going to watch the movie in theater had I known I would be only getting this much, It's one of the movies I could have waited to be available on HBO\TV or on DVD.

The special effects where not better then the first Part, only the mountain scene with Snake Eyes and Jinx thrilled me. Too bad! I've gain so much hope to this movie.The actors in the movie played well, so thats a big plus. However, the role of RZA as Blind Master was a pity..I hope the third part will be a BLAST!

What ever they were flapping their yaps about was illogical feminist propaganda or dull knife whiskey still politics. Either or... It's GI Joe. Joan. What ever. Typical bad 3D. Blurry as most live action 3D gets. And cookie cutter when they try to fix the 3D shot. Shut your brain off or else you will eventually run to the bathroom to vomit or poo. I definitely could see myself asking for my money back if I wasn't having so much fun buzzed up and watching this just for the action. Yes, it was unrealistic but, it's GI Joe.

I went in the theater not expecting much even though the trailers showed a lot of fun action sequences. Now did the movie blow me away and should be nominated for best picture? No, but it's because it isn't trying to be that type of movie, it's simply mindless and fun entertainment.I also want to say that I really enjoyed the 3D in this movie, I thought it worked and added a lot more fun to the film. The depth was really nice because it added to the cinematography of the film.Now for you that like movies for the ""dialogue and writing"" part of films, I can understand why you wouldn't like this movie as much. The conferences are not very realistic, some of the acting was really cheesy (especially by RZA haha), etc. I also feel that there were a lot of problems at the end. I mean the president look-alike just pretty much blew up England and afterwards no one thought it was sketchy; life pretty much went on. They didn't bother explaining to the ""people"" how the president was a fake or anything... Also they didn't bother adding in what was going to happen to England, they just kept on rolling on with the movie with the award-handing scene.So yeah it did have its problems, but if you're looking for a good time, I'd say watch it and just have fun with it and don't take it too seriously.",G.I.

I understood that many people didn't like the first one. I did not only because of the story line but also because of the special effects. (SPOILER) But killing off a top name actor in the first act is pretty much crap. Not only did you kill him off in the first act I didn't feel anything from the other Joe's. besides ""Johnson's"" little scene of him taking the dog tag. So you killed off a great actor and ""Duke"" one of the larger names associated with the toys and cartoon in the first act and never brought him back later in the story line or made his death mean anything...

The first film ""The Rise of Cobra"" was very well done with incredible graphics, action sequences, and an encompassing plot that made sense and was consistent with the storyline. However in this film there wasn't a plot. The movie went in every direction without a singular purpose that made sense. Honestly the action sequence and graphics were incredible, but thats all the film offered. I never clearly understood the changes in setting. It was like beginning all the Joes die except a few. They plot the demise of the president. And Cobra attempts revenge. But other than that, I don't know what the plot was or why the director found it fitting to not make a plausible plot.

To me the films plot and understory was mediocre at best. Marlon Wayne's definitely should have been in this movies.. He adds a sort of dynamic character and humor that this film so desperately needs. The first film is without a doubt better and if they make a third film, they need to fire the writer and bring in a fresh one.

Was that part 1? Gimme some clue here?Further on, when Cobra commander is freed by Storm Shadow he mentions that Destro is out of the game? Are they no longer on speaking terms? What happened there?Oh and how come GI Joe was first a really big organization with elite troops from the entire world, but is now reduced to a company size team that is practically wiped out after one unexpected attack by Cobra? And the killing of the master of Storm Shadow and Snake eyes, is now all of a sudden blamed on Zarthan, who mysteriously never aged between then and now...I feel the writers decided that the only thing the story needs is more ninja's, everything must be a win with more ninja's.",G.I.

It only recycles some of the characters from the first one but makes them much much flatter and pale. The characters show absolutely no personality. Many characters are added while they have no personality either. These new characters just show up from nowhere and there is absolutely no effort in making them connected to the story in the first one. Poorly designed story that's absolutely junk and super boring. There isn't any surprise and any tension building at all. All the cool factors in the first one is lost. I'd hardly call it a sequential to the first movie. So disappointed, totally waste of my time.

They should have called it ""GI Marvin: The new Joe's"". IMHO it didn't even come close to being GI Joe. Waste of money to see it, glad it was the second feature at the drive in after Star Trek. The mountain scenes were the best and of course that light tank at the end.

303,yojimbo_saki,GI Joe: Retaliation Fall's Short!,3,19 October 2013,"ATTENTION! This review contains SEVERAL spoilers! When I sat down to watch the original I was sure I was going to think it lame given the premise but turned out enjoying it. Apparently the original release made enough money, and left enough unanswered question's as to warrant a return. It did not warrant this disappointment! In the original it was CLEARLY established that G.I Joe was, in fact, an INTERNATIONAL group of top soldiers enlisted and trained to be the final response team if nations armed forces failed. They bunked and trained at an ultra high tech base in the desert of Egypt ready to respond anywhere in the world when needed. Now mind you, there were A LOT of Joe's there! The original film went to great lengths to establish the characters using some well known actors. None of them are present in the second film except Tatum Channing's ""Duke"" (we'll get to him shortly) and Snake Eye's and NO reason is given as to why theses dedicated, committed soldiers are nowhere to be found (one has to assume film budget played a key part) Also, there's Cobra. The super baddies with a clear objective in mind, resulting in the positioning of the Master of Disguise, Zartan in place of the President of the United States. Now, the elite corps of super soldiers appear to be nothing more then a small ""Black ops"" force, comprised solely of US Soldiers answering directly to the President. Not to mention, whereas once their existence was unknown to the general population, they are now the subject of much newsroom chatter. Their entire numbers now appear to be a paltry 30 or so, with no where near the degree of high tech gadgetry they originally had.After the assassination of the Pakistani President the Joe's are dispatched to secure a bushel of Nuclear war heads within Pakistan. After a flawless incursion into their military stockpile they secure the warheads and escape to the dessert where they await extraction.What? All Joe's accounted for, no fatalities, they sit in a dune, in unfriendly territory after just having invaded a MILITARY BASE, and they are awaiting extraction? Look, I'm no military strategist, but wouldn't you think that their ride home...WITH THE NUKES would be a wee bit more timely? NAH! They're sitting at a beach party, cutting up having brews (and I think a bar-b-Que) while Duke and Roadblock have cute witty banter back and forth while having a target shooting contest!? Did they not understand the term covert?! After some time the choppers roll in...and start firing. Now this once elite force is decimated thoroughly because they left themselves in the open, unguarded with the lights on. And to top it off, Duke bites it! Yep. First 15 minuets of the film and the lead hero gets killed.Well, from that point forward the US President (remember...Zartan in disguise) claims that it was Snake Eye's that killed the Pakistani President so Joe could get hold of their nukes. So he dispatched HIS elite fighting force ""Cobra"" to eliminate them.OY! After the battle there are only three Joe's left, all of which weren't even IN the first film Roadblock (the Roc), Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). This is Dwayne Johnson's film. The character of Flint is more cardboard then the original blister packs that held the GI Joe action figures of yore! Lady Jaye has only slightly more presence, but is used primarily for sex appeal. But at LEAST they gave her a 90 second back story to establish her character. Of course there is Snake Eye's (who wasn't in the dessert) and he's got a new sidekick, Jinx. Now outlawed the remaining Joe's seek to figure out who set them up. A deduction that takes all of about two minuets and a laptop. They then solicit the assistance of the original Joe, Joe ""Colt"" Colton played by Bruce Willis. And I am VERY generous with the term ""Played"". I am big fan of Bruce Willis (even considering his ongoing feud with another fave, Kevin Smith) but lately he has stated that he is done doing ""Action"" films. Heh. I can see that. He has a couple cute lines, but for the most part he just kind of meanders through his part, giving little to NO real presence. Very stale and ineffectual.The only really entertaining part is how Zartan/POTUS tricks all other nuclear nations into eliminating their nuclear stockpiles. (I won't ruin that one for you). Of course their is the incredibly implausible fact that 5 Joe's, 1 turncoat (Storm Shadow) and a handful of retired military can take down the combined might of Cobra AND the US military, but in true ""Good Guy Wins"" fashion they do! But only with the help of the tried and true ""Self Destruct"" button that every idiot bad guy seems to think is necessary to install on his super-duper weapon of mass destruction! SERIOUSLY! Has that EVER made sense?! Your a bad guy hell bent on taking over OR destroying the world. WHY would you install a self destruct button? What? You think it necessary to install a fail safe, just in case at the last moment, at the culmination of years of planning, resource building, construction of a monumental device you may get cold feet?! So best blow it up? SHEESH! Of course, except for Zartan and Firefly all the other baddies get away (yea, there super soldiers but their not good enough to peck off Cobra Commander as he's hanging out a chopper a mere 20 yards away!) All in all, as an action flick, it had some good snippets. If anything else it would have been mildly fun to watch, but as a sequel it fell far short of the mark and for that they need to let the franchise be finished.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
304,adrienn-szil,This movie was a real letdown,2,9 July 2013,"When the movie came out, I have got the impression that Channing Tatum is playing a star in the movie.With Channing, Dwayne,Lee, Bruce and most importantly Palicki in this one, you'd expect real fast-paced action with great visuals. It was really a bad surprise that he dies after the first 15 minutes. That was not what I was expecting at all. The rest of the movie was OK, nothing special at all.Overall a letdown compared to the first movie and it didn't seemed like it was a sequel to or rather, a continuation of the original G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra. The movie seemed liked it jumped too much, the action didn't tie in well and when there was action, it was minimal with no big epic joe/cobra scenes. it wasn't really worth watching it in the cinemas",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
305,Kszlovak,Different...very different,1,28 July 2013,"I only give it a star because of Dwayne. I wonder if they had given him the script at all or just paid him enough money to take the role. The film itself felt awfully, awfully long and very boring...after watching the first one I did expect a bit more than this. I don't think there was enough action but heaps of talking. Luckily I watched it at home otherwise i would have left the movies already. Still wasted £9.99 on the DVD which I hopefully can trade in:) My favourite part was when they just walked a 1000 miles in the hot, sweaty dessert but by the time they reached the city she had her hair curled and a perfect make up on..forgive me but I'm also a bit sceptic with these super skinny girls with super powers. I know they have to be a part of these movies but please don't let her fight with that old lady..not even in the same league ha.....well he tried but please don't let this guy direct the 3rd one....:)",G.I.

306,Jodievinson2009,Just another Rock movie!,1,1 August 2013,"So this should be called Gi Rock not Gi Joe!!! Just another Rock movie! I hate when characters are changed. This movie had almost no action and they killed off a main character. Sucks!!!if I wanted to see a Rock movie I'd watch one this shouldn't of had him in it as much as it did and shouldn't be adding new characters unless they keep the old ones too. And in the first Gi Joe, duke and ripcord used cool robot suits. In this movie all they had was stupid lightning bugs and a motorcycle that blew up...whew who, not cool at all. If they another Gi Joe, I hope they do a lot better on the cast. The best part in the whole movie was when Bruce Willis said he had high cholesterol. Other than that the movie was... BLAH!!! So to sum it up in just one word...BLAH!!! Worse than iron man 3!!! Will not be watching this again.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
307,angie_zero5,Watch this movie only if you're NOT a hardcore G.I. Joe fan and didn't care about the storyline,3,3 August 2013,"As a fan of the G.I. Joe series when I was a kid I have to say this movie is an insult to G.I. Joe fans... The special effects are great but that's something any big budgeted movies can do, especially with today's technology!I tried watching this movie three times but ending up not finishing the movie at all... While watching, I keep on forgetting that I'm actually watching G.I. Joe not another Rock movie. Don't get me wrong I like Rock but this is just too much! The first movie introduced so many characters that I thought watching this movie will give some back story on some characters and continue whatever happened on the first movie... what a let down!!! The first 30 minutes of the movie I kept on hoping that characters from the first movie will pop up one by one but again, what a let down!Story and casting is an absolute crap! No wonder actors from the first movie didn't do the sequel! Watch this movie if you're not a fan of the original animation and you're just curious about the movie. But if you're a fan like me, stay away from this movie... it's for your own good.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
308,zee_afzal,"Another ""Bllhit"" outcome from dreamers",1,7 August 2013,"well well well.......... did u c how dreamers came and picked up the war heads. LOL. this movie is sucks just showing some sort of technology but when v c it in other regards e.g. north Korea operation and removing nukes from Pakistan. i am surprised, team came by jet, dropped on roof and left with a armed vehicle and cross the country by that car. its a f***ing approach to declare a country a terrorist country.all guys in facility wore veils on there faces. this movie want to show that all nukes are under control of Taliban. what a f***. Shame on people who invest and who gave the idea of this f***ed brained movie. i think USA power is about to vanish. in Afghanistan they are dying and in USA CIA and black and white house is telling there nation that they are wining the war. they are counting the dead bodies of the their army men. they should be feel some shame when they launch their armies on another country who want their life in accordance with there religion. they are killing their own people to impose their black laws in USA. Once again i request all readers plz use Ur own brain. don't believe what this type of movies makers want u to believe. Believe the reality. And i am sure u got good and enough brain as compered to those son of bitches and war lords. God Bless you.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
309,northern232001,"Hot Guys, Terrible Movie",1,12 July 2014,"I recently watched this movie on Netflix and it was terrible. I love Bruce Willis. They should have used more of him and less of the others. I feel like this movie disgraced Bruce Willis. He brought himself down a few notches by being in this movie. Dwayne Johnson, although he is a hunk, does not carry movies very well. Also, how do you have two obviously African-American children with no supervision or female presence while he is away at battle. Did they sit there the entire time and color? Dwayne Johnson's blatant avoidance of having a black female actress share the screen with him on any romantic level is sad and disgusting. The fact that they actually thought that it was okay and no one would notice is equally as sad. It is 2014, things like this should not be happening anymore.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

311,kishoremurthy,Better Action movie. Average plot.,9,12 October 2019,"The opening scene featuring The Rock builds up real tension for the rest of the movie. Although the movie becomes slow paced for some time following the opening scene, it finally delivers with the introduction of Bruce Willis and his awesome house of weapons. The plot is as generic as it gets. The performances of the cast are upto the mark. I did miss Channing Tatum and the rest of the crew from the first movie. They could have explored the G.I. JOE suits they introduced in the first movie.
Overall, its a good popcorn action movie worth watching once since it couldn't establish a differentiating concept from other action movies.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation

314,teshavill,"More substance than the first, still pretty lackluster.",5,20 November 2017,"The question I would like to ask, is how is it that the comic book version of G.I. Joe dating back to the 80's inspired so much depth and character loyalty, yet was discarded for such a weak and unoriginal replacement? Based on the comic book this could have been parked out into many equals/prequels. The Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow story, Snake Eyes alone; the story behind his disfigurement, his romantic involvement with Scarlett leading up to it... it's gold, but instead was replaced with explosions, CGI and the plot of an after school special. Five out of ten, solely by the grace of production quality alone.",G.I. Joe - Retaliation
