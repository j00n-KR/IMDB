0,bkoganbing,Disorder and chaos,7,16 January 2017,"The futuristic society that is shown in Demolition Man reminds me so much of the classic Star Trek prime episode concerning the will of Landru. That one where the Enterprise away team finds a society that is forced to be nice and calm. The only problem these folks seem to have is that no one has provided for a Festival where people can give way to some of their baser impulses for a short while. At least that society recognized people have and they have to cut loose every so often.So other than the underground people who literally live underground this is as orderly a society as you can imagine. But disorder and chaos are on the way in the person of Wesley Snipes who was a psychotic crime lord who was released from cryogenic freezing by Nigel Hawthorne who thinks that this society will be even more orderly under his personal control. Only there ain't no controlling Snipes once he's on the loose.You got one psychotic on the loose get another to take care of him. So Sylvester Stallone is unfrozen and he also is a person difficult to control. He's a cop from the 20th century old school, but he's the only guy to deal with Snipes.Demolition Man is one of my favorite Stallone films and he's fine, but Wesley Snipes really makes this film. He chewed a few sets up to get the desired effect of crazy in his performance. That blond dye job on his hair makes him look like Dennis Rodman or for old folks like me, the old wrestler Sweet Daddy Siki. He's having a ball in this part and he lets us in on the fun.Sandra Bullock is the 21st century cop who learns all about 20th century culture from Stallone. The sex scene is taken from Woody Allen's Sleepers as they have their own version of the Orgasmatron. Benjamin Bratt is another 21st century cop who just can't get the hang of Stallone's old fashioned methods. More to the point people like him in that society just can't comprehend pure evil which is what Snipes represents.Demolition Man has enough action for any Stallone/Snipes fan to handle. But there's also a lot of humor some of it nice and satirical. One of Sly's better films.",Demolition Man
1,Leofwine_draca,Were mainstream films really this cheesy?,6,6 April 2011,"One of the dumbest action films of the 1990s, DEMOLITION MAN is a film that hasn't aged particularly well at all in the intervening years since its release. It's one of those futuristic movies that presents a pretty dated vision of the future, all plasticky looking and fake. The script is pretty weak, presenting a great number of plot holes and contrivances as it lurches from one over-wrought set-piece to the next, although such problems are offset by plenty of humour which makes this a lively watch.On the plus side, Stallone is decent in the titular role, bringing at least some charisma to the part, and Snipes is typically effective as the villain. He's let down by the script's presentation of him as a noisy, overbearing character, irritating rather than menacing, close to Chris Tucker levels of annoyance in places. Even Snipes is better than an exceptionally weak Sandra Bullock and a badly miscast Nigel Hawthorne, who looks like he wants to be anywhere but this movie.As for the action, well it's noisy and explosive and chock full of pyrotechnic effects, pretty much as you'd expect from a 1990s era action movie. Only the final showdown between Stallone and Snipes is worthwhile, and even that scene alone is packed full of cheesy little throwaway bits that date it firmly in the early '90s (including the mandatory John Woo-inspired jump-while-firing-two-pistols shot). It's a pity that the studio meddled with the movie and cut huge chunks of the violence out, as it would have been interesting to see what was left on the cutting room floor.",Demolition Man
2,SnoopyStyle,Fun campy take,7,8 February 2014,It starts in the near future of an apocalyptic 1996 Los Angeles. John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) aka Demolition Man takes on master criminal Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) when he kidnaps a bus full of people. Simon frames John for the death of those people and John gets 70 years in the cryo-penitentiary. It's 2032 and the world is an idyllic utopia where there is hardly any crime. Simon Phoenix gets a parole hearing where he escapes from prison. He's been programmed to kill social agitant Edgar Friendly (Denis Leary). The police are ill prepare to take on a real criminal. Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) is a police woman who pines for a little action. However Simon is more than even her to handle. So they unthawe John Spartan to take on Simon.This is great fun camp. The central joke works very well. Take it all with a grain of joy. The world is one silly PC idiocy after another. It's the perfect place for Sly to chafe at. Wesley Snipes makes for a fun villain. Sandra Bullock is also a load of fun. It's also a great excuse for everybody to blast away.,Demolition Man
3,lee_eisenberg,ridiculous,3,26 April 2006,"""Demolition Man"" can't tell whether it wants to be an action thriller or a comedy. Either way, the movie comes out idiotic at best. It's just another story about bad-ass cop fighting a vile criminal. And it didn't really have much of a plot. About the only good part is the machine that dings people for cursing (I admit it, that was actually pretty funny!). Why, oh why, did Sylvester Stallone have to follow ""Rocky"" with these kinds of movies? Wesley Snipes and Sandra Bullock have also done much better than this.So anyway, avoid this one. There are plenty of good movies out there. I can hardly believe that great actors such as Nigel Hawthorne, Bob Gunton, Denis Leary and Andre Gregory also appeared in this swill.",Demolition Man
4,jboothmillard,Demolition Man,7,11 March 2008,"I knew this was a film that involved Sylvester Stallone and a lot of explosions, but I had no idea of the plot, and I'm glad I gave into it. Basically it is 1996 (three years ahead of the release of this film) and one of the worst criminals of the city of Los Angeles is Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), and the man who apprehended him L.A.P.D. officer John Spartan, aka 'The Demolition Man' (Stallone) is taken with him for being an accessory in his crime, and both are put in a new prison system called Cryo Prison, yep, they're cryogenically frozen. Years later, 2035, the city changed to San Angeles, and society became peaceful, nice, kind and understanding, like the people of Pleasantville! In this world all things that can ruin this peace (with argument), e.g. meat, sex, swearing (which becomes a common joke, they hear a buzz and get a fine ticket) violence, and of course weapons are banned and unseen. When Phoenix manages to escape from his Cryo chamber, the cops decide that Spartan as the only other person with knowledge of the early 21st Century and Phoenix should be thawed out as well. So begins a chase of the bad guy with Lt. Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) by Spartan's side, education of this new (and pretty absurd) world, and many explosions and gun play. Also starring The Madness of King Geroge's Nigel Hawthorne as Dr. Raymond Cocteau (the man mainly responsible for this peaceful world), Catwoman's Benjamin Bratt as Alfredo Garcia, The Shawshank Redemption's Bob Gunton as Chief George Earle, Beetle Juice's Glenn Shadix as Associate Bob, Small Soldiers' Denis Leary as Edgar Friendly, Die Hard and Licence to Kill's Grand L. Bush as Young Zachary Lamb, Steve Kahan as Captain Healy, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer's Bill Cobbs as Aged Zachary Lamb, Rob Schneider as Erwin, look out for Jack Black as Wasteland Scrap and Predator's Jesse Ventura as CryoCon. Snipes is a great mad villain (Stallone wanted Jackie Chan, who refused to become a bad guy), the humour of this future is not only amusing, but slightly hard to deal with, just a fun film. Wesley Snipes was number 96 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Demolition Man
5,ccthemovieman-1,Typical Performances By All,5,2 May 2006,"Boy, Sylvester Stallone made a lot of money for awhile there making some dumb action-packed films...but, generally-speaking, they were fun to watch so I guess he himself is no dummy.The dialog is the movie is dumb, I can tell you that. There are also precious few nice characters to root for, including the annoying Sandra Bullock, an actress who consistently made stupid movies herself.In here, witness the typical: Stallone showing of his body; Snipes being the fast- talking profane ""hip"" bad guy and Bullock, who only knows how to say OMG and nothing else.There are some nice special-effects in here making it pretty high-tech in spots. Too bad writing is so low-tech.",Demolition Man
6,Tweekums,Great '90s action/Sci-fi film,9,15 November 2010,"Demolition Man is a great action/sci-fi movie made before the days of CGI starring Sylvester Stallone; one of the great action stars of the time and Wesley Snipes who in this film was just as good, it also features Sandra Bullock before she specialised in romantic comedies. Sly Stallone plays Detective John Spartan a Los Angeles cop who has been hunting criminal Simon Phoenix but when he finally captures Phoenix he finds himself in jail too as it is believed his excessive force led to the death of several civilian hostages. Spartan and Phoenix aren't sent to an ordinary prison; they are sent to a cryogenic prison where they are frozen for the duration of their sentences. During a parole hearing in 2032 Phoenix escapes and murders several people. By now Los Angeles no longer exists, it has been replaced by the apparently Utopian San Angeles where serious crime is unknown. The police have no idea how to deal with him so they thaw out Spartan to catch him. What follows is action packed as Spartan and his new partner Lenina Huxley, played by Sandra Bullock, search for Phoenix and learn how he managed to escape from prison.If you like action films this is a lot of fun; it might not be as violent as a lot of action films but it makes up for that with some great humour; not just the one-liners expected of the genre but the way the people in the future don't understand Spartan and the way he reacts to the changes he certainly isn't a fan of non-contact sex! The leading actors all put in solid performances and Nigel Hawthorne is good as the slightly sinister administrator of San Angeles, Dr. Raymond Cocteau. There is plenty of great action including shootouts, car chases and an exciting fight in the cryo-prison at the end.",Demolition Man
7,BA_Harrison,Explosive action and scathing satire.,8,24 December 2020,"When 20th century violent criminal Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) breaks out of cryogenic prison in the year 2032 and wreaks havoc in a seemingly peaceful utopian society, wrongfully convicted cop John Spartan (AKA The Demolition Man) is thawed out to bring the maniac to justice.I don't think I've seen Demolition Man since it came out in 1993; watching it today, I was amazed at how accurate some of its predictions of the future were (in essence, at least): in the film, digital transactions have replaced real money, there's a guy holding what could be considered a digital tablet (albeit a tad chunkier than an iPad), there are self-driving cars, non-contact social greetings (a must during these pandemic days), a board room where a virtual meeting takes place (although Zoom it ain't), and it's not hard to imagine how our current overly-PC/snowflake/cancel culture might eventually go so far as to make swearing illegal. Okay, we still wipe our butts with paper and have sex the old-fashioned way, and I don't see that changing in the next twelve years, but you can't get everything right.Not only is Demolition Man's vision of 2032 eerily prophetic in many ways, but the film also features a witty script bristling with social satire, star Stallone in one of his best performances of the dumb '90s action flick era (happily mocking his tough guy persona), Wesley Snipes having a blast as the eccentric villain of the piece, and Sandra Bullock being super cute and looking mighty fine in skin-tight leggings (and I'm not even that much of a Bullock fan). Director Marco Brambilla balances the humour and the action superbly, opening and closing with guns a-blazing and huge explosions, but ensures that there is never a dull moment even when Stallone and Snipes aren't busting skulls and shooting up the place.Hell, this film even features early roles for Rob Schneider and Jack Black that didn't irritate me - miracles do happen!",Demolition Man
8,Quinoa1984,a fairly clever future-fi butting heads with another Stallone action flick - a clash that somehow works,7,18 April 2009,"Demolition Man is such a slippery slope that it could fall apart and not work very easily. It's got a tale of a future America, run by a power-hungry but seemingly docile dictator named Cocteau (like the poet/filmmaker?), and many of the details that go with one of these 1984 rip-offs, and it's also got Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes duking it out on and off throughout the running time. This could have been tricky, but somehow it works better than it should. I wouldn't watch it right away again- it's something that you'll maybe catch on video once, maybe in part again if you really feel like it late at night on a cable channel- but for its running time it's enjoyable as a half red-meat-headed action movie and as self-knowing parody/satire.It's about a cop and a big-time criminal who are already facing off in 1996 (yes, apparently it's already turning into the future, um, three years into the future taking this as set in 1993), and then after a big blunder where Stallone's cop is unable to save a load of hostages that Snipes offs, the two of them are cryogenically frozen (Stallone for letting those people die, Snipes for being a, uh, big-time gangster who is about as evil as possible within his means) and brought back to life decades later. How this happens is already amusing- and will not be too much of a shock to fans of Austin Powers- but what makes Demolition Man tick, for the right and occasionally dumb reasons, is how much it knows that it's a sci-fi satire starring two big-name stars.It's not even so much about the plot of this cop being warmed up and set loose to track down Snipes after his ""failed"" parole hearing where he busts out. It's about what happens in a society where a big beefy bad-ass cop and big bad beefy killer are let loose in a society that is completely sensitized. There's no violence, everyone is branded from birth, there's only one fast-food chain that acts like a luxury restaurant (Taco Bell, big joke), there's also no sex (well, not without those helmet things) and supposedly no cursing even though it's still done and a ticket is fined to you if you do immediately. There are also no guns, which brings about one of the most fun sequences in the movie where Snipes has to go to a museum to crack open the cases to use weaponry as all firearms are outlawed.We get some amusing and cool side characters: Sandra Bullock, in one of her early performances, is the 20th century loving cop who takes a big liking to Stallone even though he can't seem to understand why music is all old-school commercials and that a kiss is met with a ""eww"". Denis Leary has a moment of fun going off as Denis Leary only can, though for a minute or two he gives an actual performance as opposed to one of his stand-up comedy rants. But aside from the clever bits of satire (clever in that same way that is kind of disposable like Last Action Hero), it's enjoyable just to see the two stars play their roles to the fullest. I loved seeing Snipes especially as a villain following all those serious-faced Blade movies, and Stallone even gets in a couple of genuinely funny lines in-between his obvious exterior. Demolition Man is a cool little artifact from the past, pointing to a future that more than likely wont happen.",Demolition Man
9,wes-connors,She Sells Three Sea Shells for Sylvester Stallone,5,24 August 2011,"In 1996 Los Angeles, weight lifting policeman Sylvester Stallone (as John Spartan) fights with bleached blond gangsta Wesley Snipes (as Simon Phoenix). After an explosive battle, both are committed to California's ""Cyro-Penitentiary"", where criminals are frozen in cryogenic blocks of ice. Apparently, immortality is no longer in vogue, and the practice of freezing people has become low-cost. Known as the ""Demolition Man"" for his violent tendencies, Mr. Stallone receives a 70 year punishment for collateral damage, though he seems innocently unaware of the number of lives lost. While frozen, Stallone will learn to be a seamstress...In 2032 San Angeles (combining San Diego and Los Angeles), Mr. Snipes escapes while he is temporarily unfrozen for a parole hearing. Naturally, Snipes starts killing people. Because the society has become Utopian, officials are unable to respond to Snipes' aggression. So, Stallone is brought back to life and pardoned, since he is familiar with Snipes and knows how to get tough on crime. Stallone meets peachy Sandra Bullock (as Lenina Huxley), but learns nothing about his mentioned daughter. The future overlord is sedate doctor Nigel Hawthorne (as Raymond Cocteau) with Denis Leary (as Edgar Friendly) running the resistance...***** Demolition Man (10/7/93) Marco Brambilla ~ Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, Sandra Bullock, Nigel Hawthorne",Demolition Man
10,BandSAboutMovies,Timeless,10,17 August 2019,"Marco Brambilla is a Milan-born, New York City-based video collage and installation artist, which doesn't make him a natural choice to direct a Sylvester Stallone movie. He also directed Excess Baggage, Dinotopia and the upcoming Abominable, but if you said, ""Who should direct a slam-bang action film?"" I would not answer with a video installation artist who comments on visual overload through his work.1996: maniac Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) kidnaps a number of hostages and hides in an abandoned building (the Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company in Louisville, Kentucky, which was scheduled for demolition, substitutes for a Los Angeles building). This lures in LAPD Sgt. John Spartan (Stallone) - ""Send a maniac to catch one"" - who jumps out of a helicopter directly into combat. Spartan had done a thermal scan and no bodies were found, so he goes in guns blazing.Unfortunately, the hostages were already dead and their bodies are found in the rubble of the exploded building. Phoenix claims that Spartan knew he had hostages and attacked anyway. The question of why does the court believe a man who has killed numerous people over a cop comes to mind here, but if you're going to ask questions that make sense, you're not ready for 1990's action films.Phoenix and Spartan are incarcerated in the California Cryo-Penitentiary, where they are frozen and given subliminal rehabilitation techniques while they sleep.2032: Phoenix has a parole hearing and escapes, armed with the skills he needs to survive in the future, like computer hacking. Remembering that it takes a maniac to catch one, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock, who took over the role from Lori Petty after just two days of filming) thaws out Spartan.Spartan wakes up to the peaceful world San Angeles - Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara all in one city, kind of like Mega-City One from Judge Dredd - and discovers that he is a man out of time. It's the most politically correct world ever, a place where physical contact and swearing are illegal and anything unhealthy is banned.It's also a place where Taco Bell is the only survivor of the Franchise Wars and is now considered the finest restaurant in the world. In Europe, where Taco Bell is less known, this movie substitutes Pizza Hut.Spartan and Phoenix battle at a museum that has outlawed weapons, where the villain meets Dr. Raymond Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne, who lent his voice to The Black Cauldron and The Plague Dogs). Cocteau is an evangelic peace-loving ruler who has been in charge of San Angeles since the Great Earthquake of 2010. Phoenix finds that he can't kill him because the leader is the one who programmed him while he was in cryosleep.He did all this so that Phoenix will murder Edgar Friendly (Dennis Leary), the leader of the Scraps, an underground gang that resists his absolute power. Huxley figures this all out and Spartan tries to stop him. Unfortunately, Phoenix also has an army of dethawed criminals. He taunts Spartan by telling him that he killed all the hostages before the bombs went off, doomed the hero cop to 36 years of cryo-prison for no reason.Phoenix kills Dr. Cocteau, thanks to one of his men not being programmed, and tries to take over the future. Spartan stops him and blows up the cryo-prison in the process. He suggests that the peaceful future can only succeed if the Scraps and the above ground people learn to work together. He kisses Huxley and they walk away together.It's pretty amazing how much Judge Dredd took from this film, like Rob Schneider's character and Adrienne Barbeau as the voice of the computer. It's an early pass at that film and actually a million times better. It doesn't feel dated at all, despite how silly it is at times. And by silly, I mean awesome.Fred Dekker (The Monster Squad, Night of the Creeps) actually did some uncredited rewrites to the film. It was his idea to show the two adversaries in 1996, saying ""If you don't show Kansas, Oz isn't all that special.""Of all the ridiculous ideas in this film, the bathroom seashells take the prize. Stallone has explained them by saying that the first two seashells were to be used like chopsticks to pull waste from the body and the third was used to scrape what was left. I mean, just the thought of how the three seashells work makes me pause this movie every time and try to comprehend what they're all about.The real explanation comes from screenwriter Daniel Waters, who wanted a scene where even the bathroom in the future would cause Spartan problems. So he called another screenwriter and asked for ideas. The answer? ""I have a bag of seashells on the toilet as a decoration."" Waters replied, ""OK, I'll make something out of that.""Hungarian science fiction writer István Nemere claims that most of that script was based on his 1986 novel Holtak Harca (Fight of the Dead), in which a terrorist and a soldier are frozen and then awaken to a society that has outlawed violence. He's alleged that there is a conspiracy where a man has been illegally selling the ideas of Eastern European authors to Hollywood after the fall of the Iron Curtain.There are tons of small roles in here filled with actors and personalities that I love, like Jesse Ventura and Jack Black. Jackie Chan was Stallone's first choice to play Simon Phoenix, but Jackie doesn't play bad guys, even when they planned a sequel to this.I know I said earlier about ignoring plot holes, but there's a major moment that isn't touched on in the film. After Spartan learns that his wife died, he asks about his daughter before being cut off. In truth, before the Wasteland battle, he meets a Scrap named Kate (Vasilika Vanya Marinkovic, Jacklyn Hyde from the 2000's reboot of Women of Wrestling) who he learns is his daughter. You can see him protecting her during the battle and she also stands next to Friendly when he's introduced to Associate Bob at the end (I kind of adore Associate Bob, who constantly says ""greeting and salutations"" a line from another Daniel Waters movie, Heathers).In fact, there's a ton of this movie that was cut to achieve a more teen-friendly rating, including more of the scene where Phoenix rips out Warden Smithers' eye, Phoenix spraying a crowd with machine gun fire, Phoenix killing Zachary Lamb and a battle between Jesse Ventura's character - who has been overdosed with adrenaline - and Spartan. All of these cuts make the continuity of the battle scenes in the Scraps underground lair and the cryo-prison an absolute mess.Best of all, when this movie in Kuwait, it was called Rambo the Destroyer. That's a carnie movie that even Italian film producers would have to applaud.I love Demolition Man, a film that gets its title from a song by The Police that Grace Jones sang on. It's big, dumb, loud and completely insipid - and inspired - in all the best of ways.",Demolition Man
11,Coventry,Delightfully over-the-top Sci-Fi comedy!,6,25 April 2004,"Finally we see a action-packed science fiction flick with a little sense for satire and relativity! For this genre (and for Stallone's career) that's a giant step forwards. Both super-villain Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) and LA's toughest cop (Sylvester Stallone) are defrosted in the year 2036. Society turned into a colorless mass, in which forms of physical pleasures like smoking, sex and unhealthy food have been banned. You get fines when you curse and there hasn't been a murder since twenty years! The man behind this entire metamorphosis is Sir Nigel Hawthorne and he also thawed Snipes in order to eliminate the last remainders of rebellion. The extremely exaggerated setting results in constant comedy and one-liners from both Snipes as Stallone. Wesley Snipes clearly has the time of his life as the bad-guy and his old-fashioned madness causes a lot of chuckles among the viewers. Sandra Bullock stars in one of her least irritating roles ever and comedian Denis Leary pretty much plays himself as the anarchistic nihilist Edgar Friendly. There are a few very ingenious dialogues in `Demolition Man', like the joke about President Schwarzenegger, which almost receives cult-value anno 2004. This film is great fun and one of the best genre-efforts in the last 15 years. We especially remember Wesley Snipes moral here: `You can't take away people's right of being a**holes' !",Demolition Man
12,sunwarrior13,Stallone And Snipes Are Great Double Act,9,1 January 2015,"Demolition Man is a science fiction action film that stars Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes.It tells the story of two men that were cryogenically frozen in the year 1996 and were restored to life in 2032.One is a police officer and the other is an evil crime lord.Both seem surprised as they find society where crime no longer exist.The movie was directed by Marco Brambilla.John Spartan is known to be one of the most notorious cops of the LAPD.He is in hot pursuit of a blond-haired psychopath in Simon Phoenix,who is barbaric and kills people as a whim.John was able to capture Simon after killing innocent hostages.Since John was also blamed for those deaths,both were cryogenically frozen from a society that is just too violent.Then the story shifts in 2032 in a society where crime seems to no longer exists.But a dictator known as Dr. Cocteau has managed to free Simon Phoenix from being frozen for a mission,John was also taken out of from being cryogenically frozen in order to hunt down Simon. The movie is not only a non-stop action thriller but also a social satire as we get to see how filmmakers view the future in 2032.Apart from that,we also get a healthy dose of humorous scenes in it as we get to see Stallone's character,John Spartan adjusts to the machines of 2032.The special effects are also worthy of mention especially when it was released at a time when CGI was at its infancy or not yet mainstream in cinema.And of course,any film that involves Stallone will never be short of non-stop violent action scenes that viewers who love this type of films will definitely enjoy.Overall,it was a good Stallone-Snipes film that one would still surely enjoy at present.",Demolition Man
13,hitchcockthelegend,Send a maniac to catch a maniac! Stallone & Snipes face off.,9,4 March 2008,"I look at the incredibly low rating on internet forums and I can only presume that those who voted are from the arty farty set, the kind of people who class a 7 minute shot of a curtain as the pinnacle of great cinema. I can't for the life of me believe that any fan of the dumb action popcorn picture could not have enjoyed this tremendously fun, violent, and furious film.It's 1996 and L.A. is in chaos, Sly Stallone is tough bastard cop John Spartan, a cop who is known as The Demolition Man because he does what it takes to take the bad guys down. After a slam bang encounter with ultimate bad maniac Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes having the time of his life) he gets thrown into permanent cryogenic prison (along with the apprehended Phoenix) for not saving some hostages during the show down with Phoenix. The plot then spins us to San Angeles 2032 where there is little to no crime except for some mild survival crime from an underground army led by a delightfully stoic Edgar Friendly (Denis Leary), but somehow Simon Phoenix is out, and the future is about to revert back to chaos and destruction.The police of the time just can't cope, so they thaw out Spartan to catch his old sparring partner to hopefully end the chaos that San Angeles now finds itself in. The jokes are thick and fast as Stallone enjoys laughing at himself, it's also an interesting vision of the future that writers Peter M. Lenkov and Robert Reneau have created, but in amongst the jokes is a very cute social commentary that may have been missed by the arty farty set, so although the film serves purely as a one date no brainer offering, it still can proudly lay claim to being one of the best that the genre had to offer not only 1993 (a good year for action movies), but also the whole decade.Leave the brain at the door, turn all the speakers up, and enjoy the ride. Oh and don't look at the curtains. 9/10",Demolition Man
14,Hey_Sweden,"""Jeffrey Dahmer? I love that guy!""",7,16 May 2018,"Sly Stallone stars here as John Spartan, a hard-charging, take-no-prisoners cop in 1996 who apprehends master criminal Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), only to be charged with manslaughter when it's believed that Spartans' actions caused the death of about 30 hostages. Both men are sent into cryogenic imprisonment, only to be both thawed out 36 years later.The films' biggest joke is that the ""San Angeles"" of 2032 is a lame, wimpy environment in which cops are basically pretty useless. There is supposedly only crime of the minor variety, all forms of violence have ceased, and everybody is on their best behaviour. Example: almost every time a person uses profanity, they are fined by a machine that spits out paper copies. And Taco Bell was the only fast food restaurant to survive the ""Franchise Wars"", so every restaurant is a Taco Bell.Sly fits his determined hero role like a glove, but it's the theatrical Snipes that tends to take dominance. Since films like this often depend on the entertainment value of their villain, ""Demolition Man"" doesn't disappoint in that regard. The eclectic cast includes Sandra Bullock, as a 21st century cop obsessed with the past, and love interest for our good guy, Nigel Hawthorne, as the dictator who presides over this future world, Denis Leary, as a revolutionary, Glenn Shadix, as a snivelling toady, and Bob Gunton, as the police chief, as well as Benjamin Bratt, Bill Cobbs, Troy Evans, Andre Gregory, Jesse Ventura (briefly seen, in a non-speaking part), Steve Kahan, Grand L. Bush, an uncredited Rob Schneider, and a hard-to-spot Jack Black.Directed with flair by Marco Brambilla, the movie is no great shakes, but it is fun. Its strongest asset is its dose of social satire, which may not be quite as sharp in the also-futuristic ""RoboCop"", but still elicits some very amused chuckles. There's plenty of in-your-face, violent action, and some very effective production design by David L. Snyder. The climax is pleasingly over the top.Some of the best laughs are classic fish-out-of-water stuff with Sly struggling to come to terms with this dorky new metropolis of the 21st century.Seven out of 10.",Demolition Man

Jump forward to the year 2032 where the entire population lives in a peaceful & crime free society, during a routine parole hearing Phoenix escapes & the current police force is not equipped to deal with such violence so they thaw Spartan out with the reasoning that you need an old fashioned cop to catch an old fashion criminal. Cue lots of things being blown up...Directed by Marco Brambilla this is a great light hearted 90's sci-fi action flick that is a personal favourite of mine. The script by Daniel Waters, Robert Reneau & Peter M. Lemkov doesn't take itself too seriously at all & there are some pretty funny moments in it as they have fun creating a politically correct future where anything considered bad for you is illegal, they don't use toilet paper anymore, Arnold Schwarzenegger was President (Demolition Man was made a full ten years before he became state Governor of California) & you get fined for swearing. It's a scary sort of future that if you think about it isn't a million miles away from what our Government's want now & there's plenty of amusing satire as well with the likes of Taco Bell winning the franchise war so every restaurant is Taco Bell where they have gleaming chrome posh looking beakers with straws in an effort to spruce up the standard plastic beaker of now! It just works although one has to say that the chances of the entire World adopting this supposedly perfect society & it's structure are doubtful & the rest of the World (even the rest of America) is only mentioned in passing. The film moves along like a rocket, the action scenes are suitably over the top & there are enough fights, shoot-outs, car chases & things being blown up spectacularly to satisfy most 90's action film junkies like myself. I really liked the character's too, from Stallone's homesick cop who has to come to terms with an alien future to Bullock's likable, chirpy & naive police officer who keeps mixing her metaphors up to funny effect. On the negative side Phoenix isn't much of a villain even though he gets a cool death scene, despite several people's instance that the only place you can even see a gun is in a museum by the end of the film all the bad guy's have gun's, Stallone has a gun & there also seems to be plenty of ammo to go around too & what happened to the other defrosted bad guy's? OK they might have been killed in the cryo-prison explosion at the end but where were they when Stallone was kinking Snipe's butt?Director Brambilla does a great job here, the action scenes are as over-the-top as us 90's action fans expect with a fantastic start as an entire building is literally blown up & it crashes to the ground in an opening sequence not a million miles away from the one in Lethal Weapon 3 (1992). There are shoot-outs, people bungee jump from helicopters, there's a cool car chase, plenty of fights & everything is conducted with a big sense of fun. The look of the future as seen in Demolition Man is credible, right now we certainly have the talking cars, video phones & the CCTV. The costumes are also pretty cool with Sandra Bullock looking fine in a tight leather jacket, tight trousers & boots. There's lots of violence & bad language but none of it is too graphic apart from someones plucked out eyeball impaled on a pen.Technically the film is top-notch & has that big budget Hollywood look about it, it's well made with impressive production design, music, special effects & photography. The acting is good, Demolition Man was one of Stallone's better action flicks from the 90's (apparently he was paid $15,000,000 to be in it) along with Cliffhanger (1993) & another futuristic cop flick the underrated Judge Dredd (1995) with The Specialist (1994) & Assassins (1995) his worst from this decade. I really liked a pre-stardom Sandra Bullock in this as well, she replaced Lori Petty after a few days worth of filming. Snipes is actually a bit forgettable in this but makes for an OK villain.Demolition Man is actually a pretty clever & very amusing sci-fi action film that is far better than it has any right to be, I enjoyed it a lot & it's as simple & straight forward as that.",Demolition Man
17,CinemaSerf,Stallone saves society from sterility...,6,19 June 2020,"Wesley Snipes (""Simon Phoenix"") is deep frozen in 1996 for heinous crimes - as is the police officer who apprehended him (Sly Stallone); who also managed to kill 30 innocent folks in the process. When Snipes is thawed out for his parole hearing 35 years later, he discovers that his former playground is now a crime-free utopia, designed by Sir Nigel Hawthorn (""Dr. Cocteau"") and the new citizens have no way to combat the crime spree his can easily inflict upon them all... What to do? Well, they defrost Sly (""John Spartan""), of course, and together with Sandra Bullock (""Lenina"") they set about tracking down and stopping the destruction. It's got a few twists and turns - all is not as it seems in this peaceful, law-abiding city - and Snipes is actually quite good, with his tongue firmly in his cheek and his 90's style dyed blonde coiffure as the baddie, but the dialogue is pretty ropey and the film frequently suffers from a lack of imagination as it rumbles along for almost two hours.",Demolition Man
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Typical action-comedy, delivers exactly what it promises",7,17 September 2004,"From the very first scene of this film, I was aware that it would be a typical 90's action/comedy. It's clear from the very first frame. However, once you start to watch it, you'll realize that it's one of the few that actually deliver; plenty of one-liners, action scenes, a bad-ass hero and villain, plenty of explosions and nifty guns. It has everything you could want in an action movie, and pretty much everything you could want in a funny movie, as well. Actually, the action and the comedy in the film are equally big parts of the film. The film benefits highly from having two action icons in the leads(much like Dolph and Van Damme in Universal Soldier), Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes. Stallone is well-known and credible in the ass-kicking hero part, and Snipes definitely seems to enjoy playing the cool, one-liner spouting villain. The plot is surprisingly good; it has a good pace, and is rarely boring, though on multiple viewings it can get a little bland, and it will not keep your attention(at least not through the plot), though it may keep you watching just to catch the next one-liner or action scene. The acting is fairly good. I didn't find any of the characters to be terribly badly acted, anyway. The characters are well-written and credible, not to mention (mostly) very entertaining. Snipes and Stallone have a good on-screen chemistry which makes their rivalry on screen believable. The action scenes are entertaining, well-choreographed and just plain fun. The jokes and one-liners are great; the overall humor and comedy in the film is probably the most valuable asset, as the action is somewhat outdated by now. The characters are all well-cast. The science fiction elements are well-integrated and entertaining, though rarely likely(but, of course, that is the whole purpose of the film). All in all, just a very entertaining typical action-comedy, that most likely will have the generic film-fan laughing and cheering. Most people can probably find something entertaining in this film. I recommend it to any fan of any of the actors, action films and comedies in general, and just plain action movie buffs. 7/10",Demolition Man
19,view_and_review,Demolition Men,6,31 August 2018,"Demolition Man had a summer blockbuster feel to it though it was released in October. That meant high end special effects, cool movie gadgets, and a lot of guns, violence, and explosions. These elements don't automatically make a movie good, in fact this movie was just alright. It had the potential to be better but for the antagonist. Wesley Snipes as the Dennis Rodman inspired blond haired bad guy, Simon Phoenix, wasn't bad playing a certified nut job but he was aimless. The movie begins in a 1996 dystopian Los Angeles. It's dark, foreboding, and crime ridden. LAPD officer John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) is on a helicopter in order to penetrate gang territory to apprehend the notorious Simon Phoenix. There're fires all around, dilapidated buildings, filth, and constant gunfire to let you know that this is a war zone.The 90's was an age of one man armies and that's exactly what John Spartan would be. He gets dropped right in the middle of hostile territory amid gunfire and promptly begins taking out bad guys. He wants Simon because he's hijacked a busload of children. Objective: force Simon to give up the whereabouts of the missing kids. Well, the plan doesn't go as Spartan wants, there's mass destruction, Phoenix and Spartan survive but the kids don't. As punishment Spartan is put in a cryo-state to be reprogrammed. It goes without saying that Phoenix is also cryonically frozen for presumably the same reason.Fast-forward to 2032 and now Los Angeles is San Angeles, a consortium of Los Angeles and surrounding areas. It is a thriving, technologically advanced, picturesque utopia. The people are sickeningly Stepford and the police have very little if anything to do because crime is almost nil. In steps Phoenix to break up the happy times and soon after in steps Spartan to take down the violent and destructive Phoenix.Yes, Phoenix was thawed out for a reason but it soon seemed like he was only thawed out wreak havoc. The movie should've been called Demolition Men because both characters did nothing but destroy stuff. Spartan's goal from begin to end was to stop Phoenix whereas Phoenix's goal was to... I don't know, be a violent thug? Phoenix seemed to be crazy for crazy sake. Not crazy like Joker who is creatively crazy, or even crazy like Anton from No Country for Old Men who had a job, but crazy just to be crazy and it wasn't flattering.Demolition Man, while having a cool concept, didn't seem to offer more than a lot of eye candy in the form of flash bang. There were plenty of bullets, explosions, and cool gadgets but not much else.",Demolition Man
20,neil-476,Successful on several levels,9,22 February 2011,"Demolition Man is a hugely entertaining science fiction romp. The story is deceptively simple - criminals are cryogenically frozen pending defrosting once their criminal tendencies can be amended. Psychopathic mass murderer Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) escapes into a society where law-breaking has been largely eliminated. Because the San Angeles PD is totally unable to deal with someone so vastly violent, they are forced to defrost lawman John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone), frozen at the same time as Phoenix for a crime which Phoenix set up to look as if Spartan had committed.What follows is a mixture of action, knockabout humour and social satire, well staged and performed. The different elements go together very well and actually enhance each other.This movie was Sandra Bullock's breakout movie, and also features early performances from Benjamin Bratt, Denis Leary, Rob Schneider (uncredited), and even Jack Black in a small supporting role (where he should have stayed, IMHO).All concerned play their parts with gusto, and the movie is Big Fun. Highly recommended.",Demolition Man

Phoenix, revived for a parole hearing managed to escape and uses Los Angeles to his advantage.The Police are unable to stop him with their non-violent solutions and have no choice but to let out John Spartan to stop him. Now, Spartan not only has to stop Phoenix, but to adapt himself to the future society he has no knowledge about....Ever so slightly riffing on 'Brave new world', the movie is one of Stallones most entertaining films of the nineties, and he was at this peak during his little resurgence thanks to Cliffhanger.But Stallone is outshone by snipes, playing a cross between Nicholsons Joker and Nino Brown. He exudes evil, and has some fantastic lines and set pieces.The story gets thrown to the side in favour of the action and one liners, but seeing as this is produced by Silver, story isn't really one of it's main concerns.My only gripe is that the opening scene is so fantastically made, with an explosion to make Lethal Weapon 3 embarrassed, the rest of the film struggle to keep up with it action wise, so we are left with Stallone trying to come to terms with earths changes in many 'comedy' ways.but all in all it's a great movie, very underrated by snobs, and a perfect Friday night film.Just don't remember 1996 being like that.",Demolition Man
22,Aaron1375,Has some good moments,7,14 March 2003,"The actor who made this movie the most fun to watch has to be Snipes. Stallone just isn't as good in this one as he was in Cliffhanger released in the same year.  This one has Snipes escaping this future prison where all the inmates are on ice.  To catch him they awaken Stallone's character, who was the one who caught him.  Stallone is frozen because he may have killed some people accidentally, yet Snipes who killed purposely is getting parole hearings while Stallone's character stays on ice.  That is just one of the few flaws in this one.  There are some humorous stuff in this as well as the future is a society where the gov't forces you to do everything it deems good for you and penalizes you for doing what it considers bad.  Apparently, you can't even cuss in the future.  Another problem is the worst incident of product placement ever.  Apparently, the only fast food chain to survive in the future is Taco Bell.  It is so obvious they paid to get their name in the movie, as it is the last food chain you would guess would survive.  All in all a pretty good flick.

It's always been the combination of Stallone, Snipes, and ridiculous shootouts that did it for me. And Sandra Bullock.Cut to adulthood, and this movie works on a whole different level. The PC dystopia hits way too close to home, and there's a lot of humor in that. It's kinda surprising to see a satire couched in an absurd action movie. I mean, I like seeing Stallone having a laugh at his own expense, and I love seeing Snipes gobble up the scenery, but . . . one wrong move here and this movie seems ripe for DTV hell.Even so, I get a kick out of the cheesy one-liners, and the nightmarish view of the future.

25,ElMaruecan82,"A 1993 companion piece of ""Last Action Hero"" (starring the ""other one"")...",7,23 September 2019,"I'm currently binging ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" and I lost track on the times my mind was like ""now that couldn't be made today!"". The way the show makes women easy targets for Will Smith' heated pick-up lines or Will's reluctance to show his 'feminine' side reflect the mentalities of the era. Three decades have passed and the Weinstein scandal allowed many women to speak up about the treatment they got in the past with men's excuse being ""that's the way it used to be"".There are three truths behind this: mentalities evolve with time, which is good, political correctness can be driven by good intentions, however it can also take advantage of its own power and make life totally unbearable for those who lived in freedom. Many kids who've grown up in the 2000s might be shocked by some old shows and TV programs, and that's exactly the premise of ""Demolition Man"", the debut of a still unknown director: Marco Brambilla. What if a hardened cop and a psychopathic killer came to a world inhabited and governed by the likes of that female clerk who slapped Homer Simpson because he smoked in a public area, calling him ""worse than Hitler!"". What if?But it takes a little time before ""Demolition Man"" reveals its subtler touches. When the film opens, we're like ""oh brother, here we are again"", the tough cop vs. the psycho, Stallone is Joe Spartan and Wesley Snipes is Simon Phoenix. Stallone has his straight 'no-nonsense' face as the legal dude who means business and Phoenix is like an on-steroid version of Carlton-Banks-disguised-as-Macaulay Culkin (yes, the effects of my current binge). Stallone plays it like Rocky with his Apollo-mourning face while Snipes finds the right note, he's over-the-top and enjoys his role as the entertaining super villain. How did I know I liked Snipes better than Sly? I didn't exactly cheer when the hostages were announced dead, but I didn't feel the tragedy. And rightfully so, because that wasn't the point.The point was that the two men were sentenced to be put in cryogenic prisons, postponing their rendezvous for a few decades. They meet again in 2032, after the Great Earthquake had turned Los Angeles into San Angeles (L.A. merged with San Diego and San Francisco) where order and harmony prevail. But the problem with movies like ""Demolition Man"" is that the conventional poster and the casting make for half the trailer, such movies have their box-office resting on premise of breath-taking stunts, abundant fights and spectacular explosions, punctuated by catchy one-liners. That and the cool-sounding resonance of its title, wouldn't exactly make you expect children sons sing-along moments... yet it's got them!The film is far beyond that simplistic premise and surprises by its satirical tone that even confines to self-parody. Critics noticed it more evidently than another movie released the same year, another seemingly formulaic action movie starring Sly's lifelong rival Arnold Schwarzenneger (who gets a clever little nod in the film, prophesized as President of the United States). ""Last Action Hero"" left fans and audiences puzzled for a reason that still escapes me. Maybe ""Demolition Man"" was better welcomed because it established a clear plotline and had a charming utopia that contrasted with the bleak future the ""Terminator"" franchise got us used to.The screenplay, adapted from Peter Lenkov's story, anticipates a future where people pay amends for profanity, where sex is prohibited, where even the sight of death shock cops, in other words: the over-sensitization of people through the reign of political correctness. People didn't take PC that seriously in '93 but ""Demolition Man"" warns us against a time when any word said can take you to jail, when joking is no joking matter. When it shows that with humor, it works; when it makes everything too easy for Phoenix, allowing him to be even more surprised that he's the one-eyed king in a kingdom of blinded people, it's even better. So when does it stop to work? Maybe when Stallone takes his role too seriously.Everyone in the film seems to be in the joke, especially Sandra Bullock who's just irresistible as the all-time fan of the 90s just like the kid in ""Last Action Hero"" and who idolizes that ultra-violence days without daring to experience them... she kind of incarnates the fascination and revulsion of a population that basked too much in the idle comfort of PC-ness toward any nasty fellow from the dark abysses of the prehistoric nineties. But when Phoenix came to give a wake up call, they had to bring someone of the same caliber, there's no escape.The film makes several in-jokes about the action movies stereotypes that we can't accept it as straight action movie either, so it's always frustrating when Stallone plays it straight without trying to give his character a little edgy attitude (except for the ""Ar-nod"", the sex scene and the rat burger) Maybe a hip actor such as Jean-Claude Van Damme (who turned down the role) could have fitted better but the rest of the cast did well and honorable mention to Nigel Hawtharne as some wolf-in-sheep-clothing guru.""Demolition Man"" doesn't reinvent the wheel on the scale of super-effects, it's a big machine that knows what to deliver but its recreation of San Angeles, as a new Metropolis, with two coexisting classes, the ""Scraps"" who refuse the new order provide a fine balance of judgment on the future of civilization and interesting prospects on the way to cure hunger. Now, had it gone a bit further in its critic (that's what QT would deliver in his movies) or with a better actor (and I love Stallone) it could have been one of these cult-classics, but I guess the film aged well and if it's not something attractive, it tastes better than what's supposed to be... just like that burger.",Demolition Man
26,bowmanblue,Stallone's 'Total Recall',8,26 May 2014,"The nineties were famous for its action movies and the heroes who punched and shot their way through them. In the 'friendly' rivalry between Stallone and Schwarzenegger, they both had their hits and misses. Demolition Man was not Stallone's biggest hit, but, then again, it certainly wasn't a miss.Watching it nearly twenty years after it was made is still a joy. It's still, loud, proud, blatantly tongue-in-cheek in places and a great watch. Stallone is the cop, frozen in time along with his arch criminal nemesis, Snipes, and both of them defrosted in a (supposedly) utopian future, only to rage havoc once again.There are plenty of jokes to go alongside the action and Sandra Bullock is great as the plucky lead (and you can see why her performance led on to her true breakthrough role in Speed a year later). And Nigel Hawthorne should also get a nod for his 'futuristic version of Sir Humphrey' in San Angeles - great to see such a serious character actor trading insults with Hollywood's hard men! If you like your action movies fun and light-hearted then Demolition Man stands up to the test of time. It may not be Rambo, Rocky or the Terminator franchise, but it deserves its place in nineties-action history (even if just for making the audience ask the question 'Just what exactly was the deal with the 'three seashells'?).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Demolition Man

The opening sequence was really good, but then the movie started to do many things at the same time, and it failed - it wasn't particularly funny, satyric (a bit) but the most important it didn't have any stakes or great villain - and those two are essential for an action movie. I think one of the main reason was uninspiring script and directing by first time Marco Brambilla who later did not make anything else, basically. Overall, ""Demolition Man"" has a lot of potential with its intriguing idea but it failed at the end, pretty big. Its one of Stallones worst, unfortunately.",Demolition Man

29,ironhorse_iv,"Oh man, I was blown away, how surprisingly, good this Sci-Fi action movie, was. Demolition Man is worth seeing!",6,9 April 2017,"In the ideal 21th century utopia society of the future, an old fashioned criminal, Simon Phoenix from the violent 1990s (Wesley Snipes) was released from cryo-prison, and start reigning havoc on the peaceful, yet simple-minded citizens of San Angeles. Unable to stop the bloodshed, the police force of San Angeles defrosts ex-cop, John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) to stop him. Can John Spartan adapt to the changing times, and lay down the law on Phoenix before it's too late or will Phoenix lay San Angeles in ruins with his chaotic ways? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the film directed by Marco Brambilla, too much, while, this trailer might seem like a dumb action movie dick flick. In truth, it was much smarter than it seems. After all, it was supposedly deeply influence by two great novels: author Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, 'Brave New World' & author Kurt Vonnegut's book 'Cat Cradle' that it influence the naming of characters & visuals in this film. While, the movie's story is nowhere as good as those novels. It did told a wonderful satire fish out of water story about what would happen, if PC culture was to run unchecked & anything that seem bad for you is illegal. It made for an interesting watch, even if, Hungarian science fiction writer István Nemere says that movie plagiarism, his novel, 1986's 'Fight of the Dead'; which it could had. Although, the exposition on why John Spartan is sentence for cryo-prison still doesn't any sense; seeing how Phoenix is the one that did the crime. Still, most of the jokes about the clash of culture between Spartan and the folks of San Angeles, throughout the film, landed for me. I love the running gags throughout the film, such as the three seashells or the Verbal Morality Statute machine. Because of this, it made for a lot funnier satire version of the future than 2006's 'Idiocracy'. However, I don't think, the film did a good job at satirical, the machismo action film genre that well. For a film that call 'Demolition Man', you would think, that movie would be, full of over the top explosions. Yet, surprising, the movie rarely used it, besides the beginning. Also, most of the action, throughout the film is pretty grounded with reality in Sci-Fi settling. It wasn't that silly. At parts, it was kinda intense, like the car chase or the battle at the cryo lab. I think, the problem with the movie, came from the fact that 'Demolition Man' doesn't mock any of its tropes. If anything, it seem to me, that mocking part of the story seem abandoned after Spartan is frozen. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the film is still full of 1990s action movie's clichés, such as the angry police chief, villains having lousy aim, saving the world rewards you, a love-interest, and the main character fighting the main villain, alone without much help, however, none of them, seem that, much like satire. I never got the idea, that it was mocking itself, like other Sci-Fi action movies, were, like 1997's 'Starship Troopers'. The same, goes with the odd choice of produce placement, the film was going for. It seems like they were trying to mock, the idea that a fast food place like Taco Bell/Pizza Hut, would be the only remaining restaurant in the world. However, in my opinion, they didn't really delivered on the joke. Instead, the blatant insert of Taco Bell/Pizza Hut, felt jarring and out of place; comparing to what we know, of the world. After all, isn't spicy food, meat, and caffeine, illegal in the future!? So, how in the hell, did Taco Bell/Pizza Hut won the franchise wars? If anything, Subway or Panera Beard, should be, the main restaurant, everybody goes to. However, that wasn't the only thing, wrong about this film. Despite the wonderful visuals and costumes, I also had a hard time, believing the timeline. The movie was made in 1993. So, we're expected to believe that in three years, crime has gone totally to hell in LA, and then go pacifism after the 36 years, time different. It seem a bit out there, even if there was a nuclear war; my bad, 'great earthquake' in 2010. It took 'Star Trek', 100 years to create a near-like utopia. Even with that, they still knew about weapons and violence. It's a bit weird to see the older members of San Angeles society, not know much of Spartan's ways of getting things done; when in truth, they also lived through, most of it. Are they really that ignorant to violence? After all, they seem to know, a lot, when indoctrinating Phoenix's rehab program. It makes no sense. Despite that, Snipes was great in the action scenes. While, Snipes's martial arts kinda look slow and awkward in some scenes. In truth, it was because his kicks and punches were so fast that they blurred on camera. Hence, why the producers asked him to slow them down. Snipes was also great in acting. He really did seem like a maniac. He had some of the best one-liners. Stallone was also wonderful, both physically and verbally even if some of his lines were slurred. A young and gorgeous Sandra Bullock as Lenina Huxley was also great, as she was really charming. Even Denis Leary as himself as Edgar Friendly was fine. I had no problems with most of the acting, in this film, even if most of the actors didn't get along with each other, backstage. However, I did find the unneeded nudity from Penthouse model, Brandy Ledford, a bit, out of place. It really didn't add anything to the plot. She could had been cut, along with the others minor scenes that editor, Stuart Baird, greatly took away. Overall: 'Demolition Man' is a blast. Like Simon, I say, go check it out! Anybody that says, otherwise, can wipe the crap from their mouths with the three seashells.",Demolition Man
30,The-Sarkologist,A surprising deep action film,8,23 December 2011,"This brilliant movie opens in Los Angeles 1996 where society has degenerated to a point where crime lords hold sections of cities hostage and the streets are a war zone. LA Cop John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) is chasing his arch enemy, Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) and captures him. Unfortunately Phoenix manages to set him up for the involuntary manslaughter of thirty passengers from a hi-jacked bus. The police chief, who isn't impressed with Spartan's tactics, uses this as an opportunity to put him away, namely in deep freeze.The movie then shifts to 2032 and Simon Phoenix is brought out for parole, but he somehow knows the code to release him and he escapes. The world of 2032 is a very different place. It is a peaceful world with no crime and nothing bad. It is beautiful and tranquil, but boring. Then Simon Phoenix enters the scene and the police, who are only used to arresting people for swearing, do not know what to do. So they decide to release the only person who can catch him, Spartan.This movie is awesome, not only is it full of action, but there is a lot of ideas that one can draw out of it as well. This movie is essentially about rights, namely the rights to basically be a jerk (Dennis Leary stars as Egdar Friendly, the rebel against this perfect society). Everything on the outside seems perfect, but there is a hidden area of discontent, and that is why Phoenix is brought back, namely to remove this discontent. The ruler of this future, Doctor Raymond Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne) has a plan where his vision of perfection comes to light. This is his vision and unfortunately he pushes it upon everybody else.On one level this seems to be an attack against the idea of heaven. Namely the place may be peaceful and everybody loves each other, but in reality is boring because everything that we think to be fun is no longer there. Sex is an excellent example, they discuss how rampant sex was one of the factors of the collapse of society and thus it has been outlawed. Unfortunately, this is not what the bible says: Sex is not evil, but rather something created for husband and wife to enjoy. It is not inherently evil as alcohol or greasy foods are evil. If this is what people think heaven is going to be like then they are sorely mistaken. The future portrayed in Demolition Man is more likely what hell is going to be like. I highly doubt that heaven will be a place where everybodies favourite songs are advertising jingles.Thus let us look at what the depiction of this future really is. This depiction actually one man trying to create heaven on Earth. Everything is not going the way he wants it to so he brings in a rather nasty character, Simon Phoenix, to deal with it. Cocteau is in effect trying to play God: but it is very clear he is not. He may have prevented Simon Phoenix from killing him, but he cannot control him. Cocteau wants control but with the rebels, led by Edgar Friendly, the control he wants really doesn't exist. In reality he could just ignore them and the rebels wouldn't do anything. Edgar Friendly says that he is not a leader, he just goes for food and people go with him. There is no way that he intends on taking power from Cocteau, but Cocteau's paranoia and desire for control brings everything down around him. His greed in the end destroys the society that he has created.The names of the main characters seem to give an idea to the part they play. John Spartan seems to be named after the Greek City State of warriors. Spartan is himself a warrior but also is constantly referred to has a barbarian. The differences between Athens and Sparta were vast, where Athens was the seat of culture, Sparta was a land dedicated to war. This is the same with John Spartan, for he is a marked contrast between the society of 2032 and himself.Simon Phoenix is the criminal and he even says that he has arisen from the ashes. The phoenix was a legendary Arabian bird that would die in a ball of flame and then arise from the ashes to live again. This is not only representative of Phoenix but crime in itself. In this world, no matter how much we try to suppress crime, or destroy it, our nature will always cause it to rise again in a new form.Lenlina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) is Spartan's partner and is possibly named after Huxley, the author of a Brave New World. I have never read this book myself and know little about it, but she is the first character we meet in this new society and we are introduced to the society through her. We enter as ignorant as John Spartan, and we follow John Spartan through the movie as Huxley teaches us about this new world.Finally there is Edgar Friendly. He is the leader of the rebels, or the scraps as Cocteau calls him. He is friendly as his name implies, but is not treated as such. The wasteland is feared and condemned by Cocteau and all that it stands for is slandered, but in reality it is not as bad as it is made out to be. Edgar Friendly seems to be the bad guy in this society but he is not. Truly he is friendly.",Demolition Man

Wesley Snipes completely steals the show. Sandra Bullock is also great in one of her first good roles, and Benjamin Bratt is solid support, as is Dennis Leary. The double punch of Cliffhanger and Demolition Man gave Stallone his best year at the box office since 1985. Whilst there are some good laughs, and decent action set pieces, some of the one liners are cringe worthy.",Demolition Man

34,zkonedog,Should Have Played It Straight,6,10 March 2017,"""Somebody put me back in the fridge"". When John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) utters that line about half way through this film, it really symbolizes (unfortunately) the kind of tone ""Demolition Man"" takes.For a brief plot synopsis, ""Demolition Man"" begins in Los Angeles circa 1996, where policeman John Spartan is trying to corral wacko criminal Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes). Long story short, they both end up incarcerated and flash-frozen in hopes of psychological parole 40 years into the future. When that time comes, Phoenix escapes and begins to wreak havoc on a benevolent civilization that is now not capable of handling such violence. Thus, Spartan is taken ""out of the fridge"" to try and stop Phoenix by all means necessary.Now, here is the problem with this film: Imagine the plot of a great science fiction tale (like, say, Minority Report) done in a tone like the 1960s Batman television show...pure ""camp"". At its core, this movie isn't all that bad at all, featuring a very intriguing plot, interesting characters, plenty of action, and some legitimately funny comedy. Unfortunately, the entire film was played for purely ""camp"", thus leading to groan-inducing one-liners, characters that start off interesting and quickly turn one-dimensional, and a plot that kind of meanders around without ever really delving into the interesting issues (what cryostasis is like, how the future became what it is like, morality, etc.).Don't get me wrong...this is a fun little movie to watch. But, once again, to use the Batman analogy, who is considered the ""real"" Joker: the puffed-out Caesar Romero of TV fame, or the dark, gritty Heath Ledger of Christopher Nolan's silver screen adaptation? I thought so. Had ""Demolition Man"" taken itself a bit more seriously, it could have risen that critical notch from novelty ""eh"" to ""hey, that was a good film"".",Demolition Man
35,johnnyboyz,"Excruciating fight scenes; painful product placement and a central joke revolving around going to the bathroom, Demolition Man is worth avoiding.",4,29 July 2017,"A measure of how bad ""Demolition Man"" is lies in the fact the IMDb's trivia pages inform me that both Steven Seagal AND Jean-Claude Van Damme turned the film down. The reason? We may never know, but Marco Brambilla's film certainly has that 'numbing' quality and sense of overuse of action which would not have been out of place in a feature starring the aforementioned stars. I think it would be wrong to say that there lies not an interesting idea at the epicentre of ""Demolition Man"", but anyone would be damned if they admit to what the final product resembles is the best way to go about executing it.Sylvester Stallone plays John Spartan, an all-action police officer in the LAPD occupying a dystopian then-future set in accordance to the film's 1993 release. Crime, despite the law now essentially coming to resemble what some armies around the world might look like, is overrunning the city to the extent that the ""Hollywood"" sign is permanently alight. Perhaps there is a hidden subtext to this dramatic opening vista. Perhaps not. Filmed in the aftermath of the riots which were induced post-Rodney King fiasco, buildings are ruined; gunfire sprays up from the ground at patrol choppers and rubble often dominates the ground.For reasons unexplained, Spartan is hunting a stock psychopath in the form of Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), who this time has overrun a building with a gang of thugs and is holding some hostages he intends on killing. We sense the two share a backstory, in the mould of Batman and The Joker, but it is never clear. Phoenix is not an especially interesting villain – his reasoning for what he does seems to be to merely invoke chaos at a time when all law and civility has broken down. Spartan eventually apprehends his man, but the police force denigrates him for his blasé approach which leads to the building blowing up and the hostages dying.Consequently, Spartan is frozen in ice, without being killed, so that he may be thawed and possibly paroled at a future date. This should strike us as strange for the fact much of what lies behind a prisoner being granted parole in the first place is good prison behaviour. Frozen in a block of ice, of course, negates this. However, he is thawed prematurely in 2032 when Phoenix escapes the very same prison (why Snipes' character was not given the death penalty, we do not know) and goes on a rampage for reasons which later become clearer. Spartan is charged with initially trying to put a stop to the violence and terror Phoenix is now unleashing.The entire premise is mostly an excuse to have Snipes and Stallone duke it out in a variety of locations using their fists and an array of exotic weaponry not limited to: Kalashnikov rifles; sawn off shotguns; futuristic laser-blaster guns and, on one especially silly occasion, a Napoleonic era canon. But in a post-""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" era, the hand to hand combat is not up to standard while the action sequences themselves are rapid and unmoving.More interesting is the world into which they are thawed, namely a future very much removed from the era they came from: a dreamy, gooey, wide-eyed Utopia stuck in a strange place on the political spectrum between liberalism and conservatism, and one which is now free of violence and anything which was once considered harmful to society – things not limited to: spicy food; sugar; cigarettes; sex and kissing. The pioneer of this world is Raymond Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne), who despite being a political visionary, is not adept enough to guard his own well-being following the bringing of other pre-frozen criminals into the new future.Also in the future is Sandra Bullock's existing police officer Lenina Huxley, whose character arc blunders onto the screen when she whines about the lack of crime in the city: ""I want some action!"" she moans. She'll get it eventually, although is curiously absent during the film's climax when her catharsis of really learning about violence should have happened.The film is a mostly weak exercise. Very little is made of the fact Spartan lost his wife in the interim of being frozen and then thawed and it is not satisfyingly tied in with his newfound fondness for Bullock. Can we remember, by the end, that he was even married? Similarly, the roots of Stallone's character are flaccid – he is seemingly responsible for the deaths of dozens of hostages in the beginning, but maintains this gung-ho approach again in the future when granted the opportunity to go after Phoenix again. Despite craving violence early on, and having experienced what she experiences, what does Bullock's character learn about anything? By the end, when certain twists and turns have played out, we think we've seen something more interesting than we actually have, while the film's heavy reliance on elements from works such as Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"" has the film feel loftier than it actually is. The film's insistence on bombarding us with product placement in-between its actions sequences becomes ingratiating, with no fewer than Taco Bell; Armour Hotdogs and Marlboro getting in on the act becomes insulting. Meanwhile, somewhat central to the film is a joke about seashells and going to the bathroom... When all is said and done, ""Demolition Man"" is a mostly empty, numbing experience.",Demolition Man
36,leplatypus,Constructive Movie (dvd),7,15 January 2012,"Well, the action is rather ridiculous and boring, the future is cheap and also ridiculous (even the original Star Trek show has a better futuristic look) but this movie isn't a crap after all. It has three good things that Swarzenegger movies never reached: 1) A good casting: Sly has a great duo with Sandra, and it's true that she steals the show. Beyond, all the others characters are well chosen for their principal trait.2) It's funny: Sly is actually an elephant in the living room so in a future full of rules and etiquette, he indeed demolishes everything. The explicit language alarm is a good find, all the more it's present all along but there are also a lot of others funny moments (the love waves, the diner,...) 3) It has a message: As often, the science-fiction is used as a clothing for social ideas and it's great to find them here: actually, the movie says that a world in peace can't be build by starving/excluding those who are dissident and that peace and order can hide a despotic and all intrusive power.

40,southdavid,Order Of The Phoenix.,7,28 July 2020,"I am not, If I'm honest, really that much of a fan of much of the late 80's / early 90's action films. I'm no good at ""ironic"" appreciation, which is required for a lot of them, but fortunately I found that ""Demolition Man"" held up quite well and despite lacking a set piece or two around the middle was really fun.In the near future of 1996, supercop John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) brings in criminal lunatic Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) but not without the apparent deaths of several hostages. Both Phoenix and Spartan are sent to cryo-prison for decades of suspended animation. When Phoenix escapes in the year 2032, a time when society has become a utopia of peace and prosperity, the San Angeles police force are ill equipped to bring him in, so choose to wake Spartan up and send him after his old foe.So what works? In an era before CGI really took over visual effects, the practical effects for much of ""Demolition Man"" stand out, particularly the huge building flattening that occurs in the film's opening segment. Wesley Snipes is wonderful, chewing the scenery with aplomb as he narrates his actions. Sandra Bullock is fun too, even if some of her malaprop-esque lines are a bit cringy. The whole film is pretty funny, with the police trying to subdue Phoenix when they haven't had to deal with a single murder in twenty years. The use of electric concept cars seems pretty prophetic, as does the social interaction without contact (we should have adopted that hand shake for corona times instead of a fistbump) even if perhaps the idea of not transferring data on discs of some format was a little more than they could anticipate.Less successful. Stallone, it's an easy target but his mumbling, smug turn doesn't fit well with the comedy he's asked to do here. That song by Sting over the end credits is awful. The film could also do with another set piece around the middle. Maybe some way of making more use of the gang that Phoenix has woken up. I know there was a lot of cut stuff that might have formed part of that, but it does make the middle of the film feel a bit saggy. It could also have done with being a little smarter in some situations too. I didn't need the romance between Stallone and Bullock to go quite as far as it did, especially as he essentially finds out about his wife's death the day before, and then does nothing to process that. Also Cocteau's plan? He's smart enough to account for Phoenix trying to kill him, but not that he might ask someone else in his gang to do it?But still, it's a fun, funny, well made action film and one of the few from that period I'm happy to watch again.",Demolition Man

42,Vartiainen,Perfect mixture of the 80s and the 90s,7,20 July 2015,"Demolition Man is what happens when the dark aesthetic of the 80s meets the brutal action-packed fun of the 90s. It has a foot firmly in both camps, embracing the best sides of both, while admittedly also repeating some of the downsides of them as well.First of all, beyond all else, Demolition Man is all about fun. Its premise is ludicrous, its characters are all kinds of over the top, its world makes little to no sense and every single action scene is an explosion of popcorn and cheese. And it's precisely for that reason that it works. It doesn't take itself seriously, it's here to have some fun, yet it doesn't sell itself short. There are stages at play, the characters have real problems to overcome and the movie doesn't shy away from darker moments and themes. But, it's a popcorn film first, everything else second.And a lot of kudos have to be given to the two main stars, Stallone and Snipes. The latter especially defines this movie as Simon Phoenix, who honestly looks like an Oompa Loompa on steroids, but in a good way. He's the black equivalent to Joker from Batman. Kind of. You'll know what I mean when you see him.Points also to Sandra Bullock, who serves as the audience surrogate, and delivers a very believable performance as a frustrated cop in the future where there is almost no crime to fight.Demolition Man is an explosion of fun. It was done in the 90s, but it's safer to say that it belongs in the 80s, and if you like that sort of over the top enjoyment, then this is definitely worth a watch.",Demolition Man

I really love that this was Sandra Bullock's first big role, and now she's won everything, even the lifetime achievement award. I think that's what it's called.In this movie, a police officer is trying to bring down one of the worst criminals ever. But when he blows up a building that had innocent people in it, he didn't know, by the way, he gets cryogenically frozen, along with the felon. Years later, about thirty, I think, the felon, Simon Phoenix, escapes from his frozen prison. So they release Stallone's character, John Spartan, to help the current police officers track Phoenix down. This new society is peaceful. They don't even have police officers, they have peace officers. No one knows how to handle a murderer, because there are no murders. Sandra Bullock plays Lenina Huxley, a peace officer, who is assigned to track down Phoenix along with Spartan. Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",Demolition Man

When the super villain is mysteriously awakened in a future without violence, the super cop is awakened as well to bring down his ruthless nemesis.

47,PWNYCNY,A sci-fi comedy,8,24 September 2007,"Comment #1Is this movie classified as a comedy? Because if it's not, it should be. Not only is this movie a sci-fi thriller, this movie contains some great lines, most of which are said by Sandra Bullock and Wesley Snipes, who gives one of the great performances in the sci-fi genre. Simon Phoenix is an incredible character and Mr. Snipes performs the role to near perfection. This movie is not merely another sci-fi special effects potboiler, rather it actually contains an interesting and engaging story with lots of action and humor which makes for an entertaining movie. And don't forget to be on the lookout for Associate Bob who is the ultimate brown-nosing, a--kissing flunky. Although AB is a fictional character, once you see him in the movie you will immediately recognize him because in life who hasn't ever come across an Associate Bob?Comment #2It's not about John Spartan. It's not about Simon Phoenix. It's not about Lenina Huxley. It's about the character Associate Bob. Yes, this movie is about how a man is able to survive during times of change by bending in whatever direction the wind is blowing. Spartan and Phoenix are literally demolishing a city as they renew their struggle after thirty years of being frozen in a huge refrigerator-like machine and then being defrosted to fight each other another day, Spartan on the side of the ""good guys"" and Phoenix as the tool of a megalomaniac who wants to create a new society. And while all this is happening, Associate Bob - fat, greasy, effete, with a pompadour that never gets ruffled - offers his services to whom ever may be winning - and never gets rejected.

48,dee.reid,"""Demolishing"" the future",8,25 November 2004,"Made in 1993, ""Demolition Man"" is an interesting little piece of semi-political propaganda, which comes to us with a warning about the dangers of morality. This is made even more relevant by the state of government affairs in today's America, and we are very close to the nightmarish PC world depicted in it.But a future without violence is worth it isn't it? The irony there rests in Lenina Huxley's (Sandra Bullock) fascination with 90's culture, which is seen by others as archaic and something that is better left forgotten, yet people in high positions of power hire violent criminals, like the recently escaped Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), to assassinate a rebel leader, Edgar Friendly (Denis Leary). An old-fashioned cop is also brought back into service to track down Phoenix, John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone), who uses his own methods of brutal law enforcement to bring him down.As we see in ""Demolition Man"" however, this pacifist society comes to us at a costly price - our freedom. The police are ill-equipped to handle violent criminals like Phoenix and so they need to search into the past to figure how he was caught in the first place.I don't know if most people would want to live a world like the one in ""Demolition Man""; I certainly wouldn't want to.

49,drqshadow-reviews,Head-Spinningly Stupid 90s Action Vomit with a Strong Sense of Humor,3,23 June 2011,"A teeming vat of loose, outrageous, future-gazing action concepts with one of the worst scripts I think I've ever seen. It's like somebody accidentally green-lit a Michael Scarn movie. We meet our hero, imaginatively named John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone), on the verge of bungee jumping into a gang-occupied industrial warehouse in south central LA, where a busload of hostages are held for ransom by a manic psychopath type (Wesley Snipes). Things don't go well, and at the end of the day both hunter and hunted are cryogenically frozen for nearly forty years.They wake into a utopian society, the sprawling megalopolis of San Angeles, which purports to cover most of the American west coast, though we only glimpse a few uninspired city blocks. There, before the chase is resumed, we catch wacky misunderstandings between the sheltered natives and the rugged, newly-defrosted cavemen of the previous generation. Loads of half-baked gunfights and unconvincing fisticuffs ensue, plus a museum shootout and a highway chase aboard a self-driving car.Stallone grunts and flexes, showing an awkward amount of skin. Snipes is deeply obnoxious, overplaying his villainous turn at every opportunity. Sandra Bullock is SUPER green, hopelessly lost in one of her first major roles. The core of the film is a total brainless strikeout, but one thing Demolition Man does have going for it is a sense of humor. Like Idiocracy many years later, it shows almost no faith in the greater human race, boiling many of our society's most complicated issues down to the single most moronic possible outcome for comedic profit. Life in 2032 California seems calm, but also relentlessly vanilla, with all the spices and colors stamped out by years of risk-averse lawmaking. Every restaurant in the nation is now a Taco Bell, and the people are content with that. Many such predictions have fared surprisingly well, with the recent ubiquity of Zoom video conferencing and the impending arrival of automated personal vehicles. It even predicted the brief political rise of Arnold Schwarzenegger! No cryogenic prisons or seashells in the bathroom yet, sadly.Demolition Man is almost constantly entertaining, but often for precisely the wrong reasons, given its razzie-level writing and acting.

Plenty of action, shoot outs, car chases and explosions along the way with a super fun sci-fi view of the future in 2032 ""San Angles"". And its funny, all-round way more entertaining than I thought it would be.Sure it has moments where its just your average action movie but it never takes itself too seriously and is bolstered by a strong performance from Sylvester Stallone -who I find usually struggles with the comedy roles but he does a great job here as John Spartan aka The ""Demolition man."" Wesley Snipes also must have had a ton of fun playing bad guy Simon Pheonix as he basically steals the show.Stallone as Spartan is one of LAPD's most notorious cops and the opening sequence sees him wrongly blamed for the death of several hostages while in pursuit of the crazed Phoenix (Snipes). Both men are then (encased in carbonate) cryogenically frozen to remove their violence from society.The film then shifts to 2032 where Los Angles has become a peaceful and bland place known as San Angles. There is no poverty, violence, sex or swearing and Taco Bell is the sole survivor of the Franchise Wars.Snipes is defrosted to help remove the leader of a group of underground rebels led by (Denis Leary), but of course he is more than anyone can handle, and proceeds to go on a murder/death/kill looting spree. Now the only way to stop him is to defrost an old-fashioned cop. Their final showdown is really good.As Spartan adjusts to self-driving cars and having sex wearing helmets, he's paired up with Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock), a bored cop with a (convenient) fascination for 20th-century culture. I guess this would have been an early role for Bullock and she and Stallone play well off each other -the scene where they ""make love"" is hilarious. 3/30/16",Demolition Man
52,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Wicked social satire wrapped in a nice action flick,8,25 December 2015,"Demolition Man, while being a nicely stylized, futuristic actioner for Sylvester Stallone to flex his muscles and shoot a whole lot of guns, is also a brilliantly subversive social satire, and is especially relevant today, with the deranged rise of social justice warriors and PC libtards choking out our common sense and basic human natures. I bet when the writers were crafting their story they had no idea how spot on they would be in their musings. The movie starts in the 21st century in a crime ridden Los Angeles where one lone super cop, John Spartan (Stallone looking juiced as ever) struggles to get a foothold against the destructive gangs led by Simon Phoenix (a gloriously psycho Wesley Snipes) who have launched all out war against everything. Flash to the future decades later, both men have been in cryogenic sleep, and when Spartan awakens he finds the world he left behind has radically changed in his absence. Since the fall of civilization the nation has fallen victim to a prim little ponce named Dr. Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne) who has mandated a system that excludes swearing, sex, 'lewd' behaviour, violence and eating at any other restaurant besides Taco Bell (I wish I was making this up). Society has become a doughy, pussified version of itself where everyone is a polite namby pamby cardboard cutout. Until Spartan arrives that is. He brings with him the genial, refreshingly crass sensibility of a world left behind, and Stallone has fun with the situation, spewing wanton profanities and shamelessly hitting on prudish fellow cop Sandra Bullock, who's a hoot as a restrained gal who cheekily nips at the boundaries she's tired of tiptoeing around. Spartan is defrosted to deal with Snipes who's also been brought back and is wreaking monumental havoc on a world that has no concept of violence or disorder and shits themselves at the mention of anything outside the twisted norm. Denis Leary plays Edgar Friendly, the wiseass leader of underground rebels who yearn for the days of cheeseburgers, pinup models and personal freedom. Bob Gunton lends his nattering presence to the awful police captain, and there's supporting work from Benjamin Bratt, Glenn Shadix, Bill Cobbs and Rob Schneider who wasn't content enough to tail Sly around in Judge Dredd and had to follow him into this one. Bullock is the main draw here, the only performer to take the satirical tone and run with it, padding the otherwise clunky yet fun action tone with a nice silver lining. Super fun stuff and well worth a watch these days to remind us just how silly things have gotten in our present world.",Demolition Man
53,Kdosda_Hegen,"Extremely iconic, yet disappointing.",7,9 August 2020,"I love this film so much but it isn't amazing. The best part about it is the characters. John Spartan and Simon Phoenix are so memorable and iconic. The problem with this film is that it's generic action film, it has tons of unique ideas for story, but as for action it's far not as good as Die Hard or Terminator 2.
I wish these characters get another film, directed by John Woo or John McTiernan.",Demolition Man
54,dworldeater,The best Stallone action from the 90's,8,10 September 2015,"Unlike his pal Arnold, Sly didn't do a whole lot of science fiction. This film Demolition Man is Stallone's best sci fi(or Sly fi) as well as his best action movie from the 90's. Set in a future where political correctness and uptight corniness are taken to the extreme. These shiny happy people are ill equipped to deal with psychotic master criminal Simon Phoenix(Wesley Snipes) who is running wild in this Mr. Rogers neighborhood. The authorities then defrost wrongfully convicted super cop John Spartan(Stallone) from cryofreeze to deal with Phoenix. Like most good science fiction there is some rich subtext and social commentary to be had here. However, it is handled in a lighthearted manner with humor. While there is a bit of substance at the core of the film, Demolition Man is very entertaining with large doses of action and humor. Sandra Bollock and Sly play off each other wonderfully here. Wesley Snipes is a great nemesis for Stallone, who also did a great job in carrying the film. Unlike most of Stallone's 90's action films, this Stallone/Snipes face off holds up and is a very memorable and well made science fiction/action movie.",Demolition Man
55,Agent10,FUTURISTIC HIGH COMEDY!,7,20 May 2002,"Sylvester Stallone was really beside himself when he took this film. Instead of trying to be the tough guy, he sort of made fun of his pre-existing persona in his role as John Spartan. Funny, and satirical of a gun-free society, it just proves that peace doesn't necessarily result in the most diverse range of self expression. The humor in the film was exceptional, and Wesley Snipes was great as Simon Phoenix. This also proved to be my favorite film with Sandra Bullock, who subsequently destroyed her career thereafter. This movie will always be good for a laugh, especially for the characters singing all of the commercial jingles.",Demolition Man
56,adamjohns-42575,Murder Death Kill,7,4 August 2020,"Probably not Sly's worst film! I actually, really like it, even after 27 years. It's frightening to see that even in 1993, filmmakers could see a terrible future and it looks like we're heading in that direction either way. A utopia would be nice, but not like Dr Carteau's and I just hope there are better law enforcers out there to defend me when the time comes. But that wouldn't make a good film, so the huge explosions, violence and gun toting John Spartan will do for entertainment purposes (Be well John Spartan).Wesley makes an excellent psychopath and Ben Bratt adds some eye candy to detract from ""Neck Down"" Stallone. Even Sandra plays her part very well.
It's comic book, it's cheesey with a side of ham, but it's just so damned enjoyable and I don't know why.For as long as I live I will never understand the 3 Sea Shells, even with the explanation provided in the IMDB Trivia section and I don't think I want to.",Demolition Man
57,rbverhoef,Stallone-fun,5,30 July 2003,"'Demolition Man' is a lot of fun to watch. A lot of things in the movie don't make any sense but those things create opportunities for some nice action and some funny moments. I am not sure if all the laughs in the movie were meant to be funny, but if you laugh, what does it actually matter.In the future in the city San Angeles (the area from San Diego to Los Angeles) after the earthquake people live in a perfect world. For a long time no murder has committed. Then Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes)escapes. Over 40 years ago he was a criminal arrested by John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone). Spartan killed a lot of people during Phoenix' arrest, so he was punished as well. They both were frozen, possible in 1996 in a cryo-prison. Now Phoenix has escaped (how he does this is a secret that will be revealed later in the movie) the police can't handle him because they are not used to his violent behavior. The only thing they can come up with is Spartan. With the help of Lt. Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) he must catch Phoenix and learn to know the new world.The story above sounds ridiculous which it sometimes is. But you can understand there must be a lot of funny moments. Almost everything Spartan used to do is illegal now and he just can't get used to it. Snipes is a great villain, Stallone is nice as long as he is in this kind of movie and Bullock has some fine lines. I enjoyed it very much.",Demolition Man
58,robertemerald,Some great tongue-in-cheek in this futuristic Stallone action adventure,7,23 November 2019,"Demolition Man has to be congratulated for its fairly accurate vision of the future. Driverless cars, video conferencing, laser cutting, voice activated commands, microchip GPS, and CCTV surveillance are all there. Less successful are the other changes envisaged, nearly all a result of cryogenics, in particular a crime-less society (save for the graffiti - there's a pop up laser for that). It's not like Minority Report (2002) though, as all the cops have become wimps. I have to take my hat off to the script if not the story, which is a typical Stallone hero tale. The script is very fun indeed. Some good writing went into how people from 2032 talk, wonderfully delivered by a charmingly energetic Sandra Bullock. The star though is definitely Wesley Snipes, whom must have been villain of the year for 1993. This movie is not as extravagant as Judge Dredd (1995), but it would be in the same ballpark as Total Recall (1990). There's a few classic lines too, such as Stallone claiming ""I can do subtle"", which, of course, he can't. Some great actors throughout bring much sparkle to their roles. It's a little long this movie, especially today, but you can't fault the fireworks, the stunts and the action. Demolition Man is still great popcorn entertainment.",Demolition Man
59,Samiam3,Good for a laugh (useless otherwise),5,27 August 2010,"The more we progress through Demolition Man, the harder it gets to believe that this movie is not a comedy. It is so clunky, and stiff in its writing (not to mention silly) that Demolition Man sort of recalls the Star Trek of the 1960's. Indeed, this movie's only strength is that it is funny, sometimes intentionally so, but usually unintentional.Demolition Man's portrayal of the future is arguable the most comedic since Woody Allen's Sleepers. In the year 2031, everything between L.A. and San Diego has merged to from San Angeles. In this 'supposedly' ideal utopia, the dialect of the common folk is comprised of phrases that are so long and incovinitient to say, that you'd think they would be better off speaking Shakespeare's tongue. In this society, sex is illegal, as are unhealthy products like salt, nicotine, coffee, porn, all music on the radio is sappy commercial jingles, Taco Bell has becomes a fancy restaurant, and for swearing in a public place, you get fined. It's impossible not to laugh at all this, which makes it harder to engage in the movie's prime focus; Stallone and him doing what he does best. AS an action movie Demolition Man delivers its share, and even here, there is a presence of humour. Stallone and Snipes exchange rounds of lead in a museum of late twentieth century item, and they fight their way into a wax recreation of a 20th century Los Angeles street. The makers of Demolition man really should have embraced the possibility of making this a comedy. As it is, the film is mediocre, and a handful of science fiction quirks don't make it worth a watch.",Demolition Man
60,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A Different Kind Of Action Comedy,8,18 December 2011,"Sylvester Stallone has tried many times to lose his macho manliness by playing in films that involve silly plots and characters. Most of them are not good movies - however he has made a couple comedic action films that do stand out from the rest. Demolition Man is one of these films. There are many elements that help this movie excel past other comedies action flicks. The characters are funny to watch and listen to, the action is very good, and the special effects are well done.The cast of this movie is pretty big. Sylvester Stallone stars as a record-breaking cop, John Spartan, who has jailed the most of amount of criminals during the 20th century. He's the last resort when it comes to taking down the real baddies. The character itself resembles Marion Cobretti from Cobra (1986) because of how he's relied on to do the hardest jobs on the force. The only difference is that Spartan is probably a little more outgoing than Cobretti. Co-starring with Stallone as his partner is Sandra Bullock playing as Lenina Huxley. Although Bullock played in a couple movies before this, I think this is where her career finally took flight. Playing the villain, Simon Phoenix, is Wesley Snipes who plays an eccentric psychopath with two different colored eyes. Nothing better than adding some strange features to the bad guy. To keep the viewer glued to the screen, director Marco Brambilla even cast Rob Schneider and Jack Black. Note: Schneider's appearance is longer than Black's appearance. Jack Black appears very briefly and he's hidden a lot so you got to have a keen eye.The action in this film is good too. In my opinion, any movie where Wesley Snipes is involved, is a good action movie. Snipes is a trained martial artist and his style of fighting is really neat to watch although it is quick. The only thing that I did not like about this movie was that there was not enough action. I felt like the film could've had more action scenes but for the most part I enjoyed the film. What made this movie funny was the dialog. Because the story takes place in a futuristic society, much of the language was changed. And some of it is truly weird but it's a funny weird. Stallone and Snipes also have funny moments because of having a hard time understanding and communicating with all the other residents.Lastly, because this story line takes place in the future much of the technology is different. I felt that a lot of the special effects were very creative. For example: most of the cars were on auto-drive but as soon as manual driving was turned on, the steering wheel would enlarge and allow the driver to take control. That's cool if you ask me. It's even cooler when the cars get into accidents but I won't say because I'll ruin the surprise.It is rare that Stallone makes a good action/comedy film, and Demolition Man is one of them. With interesting plot devices and a funny screenplay, this movie is sure to entertain any action/comedy moviegoer.",Demolition Man
61,PredragReviews,Ahhh the classics..,7,10 May 2016,"Demolition Man is a great movie to just pop in and unplug from the world. This movie in my opinion has a great mixture of action and comedy, sprinkled with some Sci-Fi. If you are unfamiliar with Demotion Man the summary of this movie is as follows; Demolition Man is a 1993 American science fiction action film directed by Marco Brambilla his directorial debut, and starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes.Stallone is perfect in his role as the tough 'old fashioned' cop who is released from Cryosleep to help the new SAPD. A blonde Wesly Snipes is also brilliant in his role as the heartless criminal Simon Phoenix who starts a meaningless rampage through the city. Originally Stallone wanted Jackie Chan to play this role, however he turned it down as he did not like playing bad guys.However both stars work very well together, producing some very exciting fight scenes, Snipes being a black belt, and Stallone's experience from the Rocky films helping them. In fact Wesley Snipes was so fast on camera that the producers had to ask him to slow down as he was too much of a blurr. Of course, lets not forget Sandra Bullock who replaced Lori Petty after a few days filming, and is very well suited to her role as Lenina Huxley, and helped to bring that vital mixture of comedy into the film with her studies of the past. Both her and Stallone work well on-screen together with the scene in her apartment being a great laugh.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Demolition Man

Plenty of clever ideas (some, admittedly, underdeveloped), even more laughs than explosions; attention-grabbing design of the futuristic world, through the grungy underground is awfully derivative and unconvincing. Stallone is nicely relaxed as the unfrozen caveman hero, Snipes amusingly overblown as the loudmouth baddie, Bullock even more appealing here than she would be in her star-making-turn-to-come in ""Speed"" the following year.

When Simon Pheonix escapes into a new world in the year 2032, the police have no way of dealing with such a vicious arch-criminal so they re-animate John Sparton, and so it begins.I simply love the way the future is portrayed in this film, it is a wonderfully satirical crime free environment where the humans have become ultra-placid geeks under the new regime.

It features some great culture satire bits a la Sleeper, as stuff like corny commercial jingles are sent up for satire. Look for an envisioned 2030 (prophecied by tongue-in-cheek), which has about as much chance of being fulfilled as a used-car dealer's promises.

66,oneguyrambling,"Like Heidi Montag, shiny impressive on the outside, but ultimately fake, vacuous... and packed with sand?",5,8 June 2011,"Sly Stallone is John Spartan, a tough cop known as the Demolition Man due to the chaos and destruction that inevitably comes with him getting results.Early in the film Spartan finally manages to do what no-one could manage, he tracked down and captured Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), a dastardly savage mastermind with no morals and no qualms in killing dozens of hostages to get his way.Unfortunately on this occasion he does just that – 30 innocents perish – and John is tagged with the responsibility due to his unconventional methods.It must be said that for the fact Phoenix was labeled ""ungettable"" seems a stretch, sure John Spartan had to dodge a few bullets and bust into the abandoned warehouse HQ singlehandedly but he hardly cracked a sweat doing so. And the less I say about the tenuous leap to judgment over his guilt in the death of civilians the better.Anyway long story short both Phoenix and Spartan are given the same jail sentence of 50 years (!), however this being the distant future of 1996 they are not thrown behind bars but cryogenically frozen, with subliminal messages being continuously pumped into their brains to convince them of ""the error of their ways"".Still with me? Every so often it seems Phoenix is temporarily thawed for a joke of a parole hearing, he and the warden go through the motions and when he expresses no remorse and shows no signs of rehabilitation it's straight back into the ice tray for him – Spartan never seems to get this opportunity for some reason.In 2032 however Phoenix springs an unexpected (*chuckle*) and ingenious escape (not really ingenious). Now much has happened in the world since the ""chaos of 2010"", the world is now an extremely sterile and harmless place, everyone is ""nice"" in every sense of the word too nice. Everything deemed harmful (read: interesting) has been made illegal: drugs, alcohol, swearing, fatty foods and even sex is banned – with fines being issued on the spot for bad language by automated sensors that littler the landscape.Everyone not interested in toeing the line has gone off the grid to a vast underground community where they can smoke, drink, swear and bonk to their clogged artery's content. Through desperation and hunger these rebels must venture to the surface for food, risking capture in doing so. (A wise decision was to cast the leader of these underground rebels Ed Friendly, with Denis Leary – the Assh*le himself.) Back to the line-toers. With everyone being so nice and friendly crime is practically non-existent and the police force are basically little more than onlookers. To give an example of the toothlessness of the force Rob Schneider is a cop, a skinny and extremely young (and pretty) Benjamin Bratt is a cop and Sandra Bullock is a cop – the tough, rebellious one! Anyway as movies must after 30 minutes of p*ss-farting around they realise that the only way to catch a vicious criminal with no remorse and no moral compass is to unleash another one. So the next hour has Phoenix and Spartan chasing each other all over the pretty city, blowing stuff up and shooting at one another while everyone looks on aghast and Sandra Bullock takes notes and dampens her police issue slacks.It seems that while Spartan was under he was taught life skills better suited to a nursing home, while Phoenix is stronger and more deadly than ever before – and now it appears that he has a new plan.This big budget flick from the early 90s might have been effective back then but now it is unbelievably dated and the sets in particular are sterile and lack credibility. I know this is a new and improved world but everything looks fake and made out of cardboard or foam. The lingo invented for this new society is ridiculous and laughable for the wrong reasons, especially when they have Bullock repeatedly botching phrases from the 90s with (allegedly) hilarious results.I had only fuzzy recollections of this film, I knew Snipes had a Mohawk and the most basic details of the plot, what I had forgotten was just how manufactured it all was. From the sets to the dialogue to the props and costumes it is all just so fake and distracting. I wanted to enjoy this as an old school sci-fi shoot 'em up but in the end gave up trying, when something so obviously fabricated tries to impress and look pretty it is hard to give credit.After all just look at Heidi Montag, on the outside everything appears bright, shiny and frankly impressive, but ultimately it is 100% man made, and the inside is vacuous, bereft of worth and packed with sand.Much the same could be said for Demolition Man. (Maybe not the sand part.) Final Rating – 5 / 10. Lots of money spent to make it all look good, pity there was precious little behind the façade.",Demolition Man
67,BrandtSponseller,Excellent cultural satire,10,3 May 2005,"John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) is a reckless Los Angeles policeman, known as the ""demolition man"" for the destruction he routinely engenders while apprehending big baddies. After a particularly ruthless criminal, Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), sets him up by making it appear that Spartan wantonly caused the deaths of a bus load of hostages, Spartan is sentenced to 60 years or so in prison. The film begins in a not-too-distant future (relative to its 1992/1993 production date) of 1996. Prisons are quite a bit different, and there's a new policy of cryogenically freezing inmates. We cut forward to 2032. Phoenix is up for an obligatory parole hearing when he escapes. The film's 21st Century society is extremely different (worsening cultural chaos, exacerbated by a huge earthquake, precipitated the change), and the ""San Angeles"" police cannot capture Phoenix or keep him in check. Chief Earle makes a decision to revive Spartan, reasoning that an out of control but effective cop mired in the ways of the late 20th Century may be the only one who can capture the out of control criminal, but he, and the future society, may be in for a lot more than they bargained for by reawakening the Demolition Man.Demolition Man is one of the funniest, most action-packed and most poignant social satires of at least the last 30 years. It's not necessarily the easiest film to appreciate, as it makes its points through extremely over-the-top ""mindless"" action and tongue-in-cheek, purposefully cheesy plot and dialogue, but it's well worth trying to acclimate oneself to the style if you're not an action or sci-fi fan, as the satire cuts deep. There are other films with somewhat similar aims, such as Total Recall (1990) and Starship Troopers (1997), which are perhaps just as good as Demolition Man, but they certainly can't top it, and they have aims other than the purely satirical.The opening scene feels like a typical late 1980s/early 1990s action sequence. At least until we realize that there's not going to be a happy ending for the hostages that Spartan is trying to save. Once we arrive at the future, a lot of viewers might misjudge the performances of the principal cast besides Stallone and Snipes. Sandra Bullock, as Lieutenant Lenina Huxley (a reference to Aldous Huxley's book Brave New World), and Benjamin Bratt, as Alfredo Garcia (a reference to Sam Peckinpah's 1974 film, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia), at first seem to be turning in bizarrely incompetent performances. It's only later that we realize they are spot on for the film's ""brave new world"", which is basically an instantiation of a staunchly moralist cult run by Dr. Raymond Cocteau (a reference to famed director Jean Cocteau combined with Cocteau's friend, novelist Raymond Radiguet).Technically, the film is quite impressive. The production design, cinematography, effects, staging of the action sequences, score and soundtrack are excellent. But what sets Demolition Man a cut above the rest are the script and the performances--yes, even from Stallone and Snipes, although Bullock, and especially Denis Leary, in a relatively minor part where he gets to do his motor-mouthed, ranting comedy schtick that made him famous, both threaten to steal the show.Director Marco Brambilla (who has remained oddly inactive since Demolition Man, which was his first film) and his writing ""team"" skewer a lot of cultural norms as relatively arbitrary conventions. Radio and television commercial jingles are considered the pinnacle of musical art in the film's world. Strict morality is enforced through constant computer monitoring of behavior combined with fines--a running joke throughout the film is that profanity results in fines. Meat and alcohol have been outlawed. So has physical contact, including sex. All restaurants are now Taco Bells (in some cuts of the film intended for foreign markets, this was changed to Pizza Hut instead). There is an underground, outside of the cultic mainstream society, but they're literally underground, living relatively lawless (well, at least they eat meat and drink beers) in tunnels strewn with utility pipes.As a result, serious crime is a thing of the past, swept under the rug (or into the sewers) and labeled with Orwellian newspeak. Phoenix and Spartan's reintroduction of violence and mayhem, including ""murder/death/kill"", results in a reawakening of cultural freedom, analogous to their own thawing out. The anti-utopian, anti-utilitarian political message, like that of Orwell's 1984 and later films influenced by the same, such as Equilibrium (2002), couldn't be clearer. And the message can be extended to situations that are not political. I didn't use ""cult"" above carelessly. The idea is that the society's warts are necessary for individual authenticity. Yes, things can run smoother under a dictatorship, but who wants to live under a dictatorship, even a supposedly ""benevolent"" one?",Demolition Man

69,blott2319-1,Worst world-building ever?,3,14 January 2021,"I remember watching Demolition Man decades ago on a VHS rental and hoping against hope that it was going to be another awesome early 90s action extravaganza. My mind tried to reset to that same hopeful expectation on rewatch that it would be better than I remembered. Sadly, both times I was doomed for disappointment. My first problem with Demolition Man is simply that they do little or nothing to make the characters endearing. Sylvester Stallone plays a rogue cop who is never given a moment to shine as a good guy, and simply giving him an overly harsh penalty doesn't magically make him more endearing. Sandra Bullock and the rest of the people in the ""future"" are so dumb and naive that they fail to do anything worthwhile, and only get in the way most of the time. It's perhaps even more egregious from her character, because she's supposedly a fan of the 20th century, yet she has no knowledge of what it was like. And Denis Leary is just covered in fake dirt while doing snippets of his stand-up routine.Easily the most problematic part of Demolition Man isn't the characters, though. It is the overall logic of this world they built. NOTHING in this movie makes a lick of sense. They might have alleviated a lot of the logic problems if they simply set the future like 1000 years later, or something like that. At least then we could buy that, over the generations, mankind adapted and changed. But instead there are still people in society that John Spartan knew when he was frozen, just a little older. So how did the entire world forget all of history and change the nature of humanity despite the fact that a generation of people who had grown accustomed to swearing, violence, physical contact, etc. is still alive? There are so many things that bug me when I watch this movie, and I think they are just included as jokes, but I'm not sure why these jokes are supposed to be funny. For instance, everyone only listens to commercial jingles, but jingles from the 1950s. How does that make sense? And how can you have the jingles, but not other music, or the TV shows that they aired during? Sandra Bullock has a poster of Lethal Weapon 3, how is she so shocked by violence?It's hard for me to express how dumb this movie seems, and the plot is so predictable that it doesn't do much to distract from all the stupid elements of this future world. I can see why some people would consider Demolition Man to be one of those movies that are so-bad-it's-good, because there is so much nonsense, all you can do is laugh at it. I only wish it felt more intentional. There are certainly moments in the film that are clearly intended as humor to make the audience laugh, but any time the plot rears its boring head, I'm reminded that they want me to take something in this film seriously. Stallone's performance is just as confused as the film, because at times I think he's playing things a little tongue-in-cheek, but then in the next scene he's as straight as Rambo. Wesley Snipes seems to be the only one who fully gets the stupidity of this movie, because in every scene he just looks like he's having fun. I only wish I could have as much fun watching Demolition Man as he seems to have making it. For me, this is a movie that is laughably bad, but not with enough laughs to make it worthwhile.",Demolition Man
70,sarastro7,"Very, very, very little wrong with it!",10,22 November 2006,"When I watched Demolition Man in the theater in 1993, I was moderately entertained but didn't think that much of it. I was slightly disappointed, in fact. It seemed cheesy, its sets sort of silly.Over the years I've come to like the movie more and more. I am now convinced that this is a movie on its way to becoming a huge cult favorite, if it isn't already. I can see now that its comedy is marvelously perfect. It's got so many different types of jokes, and so much to say about the state of both current and future society. And the acting is fantastic all-round.The somewhat dis-spirited society of the movie is a thinly veiled commentary on our real world, and the underground rebellion signifies that something along those lines is necessary in our society, too.Overall, the movie is incredibly comically successful, and overlaid with plenty of social themes - it is very nearly a work of total and utter perfection. I've just emended my rating of it from 8 to 9 - I shouldn't be surprised if one day I'll find it worthy of a perfect 10.Later edit: That day has come! I have now seen the 1973 Woody Allen movie Sleeper, and realized that Demolition Man is an outright remake of that movie! (Despite this not being apparent from IMDb's ""movie connections"" page - somebody wake up Hicks!!) This makes it even more brilliant and hilarious, as Woody Allen's character has been turned into Stallone's! Remember, in Sleeper, the only ones not frigid are those whose ancestors were Italians! :-) The plot elements of Demolition Man are updated versions of those of Sleeper, but the basic structure remains the same, as anyone who's seen both movies is bound to admit.

71,vip_ebriega,Send a maniac to catch a maniac.,7,8 July 2008,"My Take: Noisily action-packed and neatly satirical. The year is 2032. Welcome to San Angeles. What was formerly known as Los Angeles is now a peaceful metropolis where everything is near-perfect. Anything harmful to your health (or so it seemed) is now banned and considered illegal. Sex has been reduced from a natural exchange of body warmth is now a contact-free virtual reality to spare the possible expense of AIDS. Graffiti is a crime of heavy proportions, and must be removed immediately. All food outlets are Taco Bell (after a so-called ""manufacturing war"" wiped out its competitors) and profanity is extremely prohibited (each 'f*ck' or 'sh*t' comes with a warning ticket). Everything is one peaceful paradise, but when a wreck-less terrorist from the violent past arrives, it's up to a crime fighting cop to match wits and brawn, the ""old-fashioned"" way.At first glance, DEMOLITION MAN is yet another silly made-for-the-summer-audience entertainment, and by any perspective, it is. It's silly, over-the-top and at times hokey. But like most summer movies, it rarely needs to be taken too seriously, and the film itself does neither. Sure it's violent and action-loaded, but the tongue is placed firmly in cheek and the whole film never fails to be a self-lampoon of itself. There's a wallop of violence, but there are also a savory batch of comedy and genre satire. Sylvester Stallone plays John Spartan, aka ""Demolition Man"", a take-no-prisoners cop who is cryogenically frozen and then thawed when wacko terrorist Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) escapes from his prison and wrecks all manner of havoc. It's up to Spartan, with some support from female futuristic cop Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock, way before her big role in 1996's SPEED), to fight Phoenix off the ""old"" Mano-a-Mano way, gun-play and numerous explosions all in.DEMOLITION MAN also co-stars Nigel Hawthorne as Dr. Cocteau, the man who discovered and developed the nearly-perfect paradise and Dennis Leary plays an underground rebel ala Robin Hood who believes the all-too-perfect paradise is too off-whacked. Overall, it's under the direction of Marco Brambilla, who lifts the curtains up and just lets the show roll. He's quite the stylist, as he provides some stunning nods to impressive sets and costumes, which at the same time satirizes genre conventions. In fact, much of DEMOLITION MAN is ripe-for-parody, but that's just the point. It's basically a parody of itself. It has a lot of fun, and has quite a lot of fun at itself. Stallone and Snipes head-to-head confrontations are one of the film's greater aspects. Snipes no-holds-bar psycho is more than a match for ""Yo!"" guy Stallone's no-holds-bar and wisecracking hero. For pure brainless afternoon entertainment best with a tub of popcorn, DEMOLITION MAN makes an agreeable rental.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Demolition Man
72,fmarkland32,Frozen Assets,6,27 September 2006,"Sylvester Stallone stars as John Spartan a present day cop who is thawed out of suspended animation when his arch-enemy Simon Phoenix(Wesley Snipes) runs amok in a totalitarian society where profanity is illegal and everyone is forced to act politically correct. Lots of fish out of water jokes ensue as frequent as the non-stop action. Demolition Man shares a lot in common with Universal Soldier, in that two adversaries battle each other in the future and both of them are respectable action stars in their own right, however Demolition Man adds in more jokiness and works well at both action and comedy. However one plus that Universal Soldier has, was that it didn't have Sandra Bullock. Demolition Man is actually a well made and fairly enjoyable action flick, sure the story is ridiculous and it does have Rob Schneider and Bullock but it works on a visceral level and it remains of of Sly's better movies of the 90's.* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)",Demolition Man
73,one9eighty,Murder/Death/Killing expectations with cult longevity for this unappreciated great,7,27 July 2018,"In the 90's when action films where big and loud, filled with explosions and usually had one of the Planet Hollywood super owners in them (Sly, Bruce, or Arnie) films a plenty were made. ""Demolition Man"" was carved out in that era. Stallone plays John Spartan; a cop from the 90's who is framed for mass murder while he attempted to bring down Simon Phoenix's (Wesley Snipes) reign of terror to an end. Rather than the death sentence, both are cryogenically frozen and left to be forgotten for the duration of their sentences. Fast Forward to the year 2032 where crime has been eradicated and society is happy happy nice nice, Spartan is unfrozen. With a police force ill equipped to handle a 90's villain, Office Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) - obsessed with 90's culture - suggests bringing Spartan out of cryogenic retirement to fight Spartan. The battle begins, both men out of their own time, fighting in a world that isn't ready for them - unbeknown to them, there is a sinister and secret plot unravelling for which they have been used as the fuse, bait and blame. The cheesy action film is more than just an action film; it's funny and satirical too. While being OTT and very in your face, it's also clever and sly too. The cast all deliver, and it's an odd and jumbled cast at that - but it works, from Nigel Hawthorne and Dennis Leary, all the way to Stallone and Snipes. Visually and narratively, the film is clever enough to not take itself too seriously and it's that which makes it a very approachable film. I'd put this in the same category as 90's ""Total Recall"" or ""Starship Trooper"" as they all offer a satirical look into life and the future of society - it's just that ""Demotion Man"" does it in a friendlier way. I remember when this first came out at the cinema and it didn't receive the best reviews, I've never been able to see a reason why - I think it's a lovely film which is easy to watch and very entertaining. 7 out of 10.",Demolition Man

Surprise, surprise, the entertainment side of the Entertainment Industry's House has left the building. This movie was fun. Sandra Bullock and Sly were outstanding in this romp into the future. The one liners were excellent and they never missed a beat. I really love the ""Practical Magic"", Bullock, but this character was so neat. I know, I know, she's a serious actor, but she was great in this. Both Mr. Stallone's and Sandra's comic timing were superb. The writing and script were outstanding and the direction was spot-on.

Great entertaining movie, Hollyweird must leave this alone.",Demolition Man
75,KnightsofNi11,Laughably bad,4,18 December 2010,"Let me start off by saying that this movie is terrible. It is absolutely awful. It is moronic, silly, and ridiculous. It is the kind of movie I would expect to come from the likes of Michael Bay or Uwe Boll. But all that being said, I don't necessarily regret watching this film. It was entertainingly bad and I honestly got a few chuckles out of some of the satirical humor in parts of the film, but also plenty of laughs from how awful it was. Demolition Man is set in the mid 21st century in a society that is now violence free. However, when a 20th century criminal psychopath breaks out of prison to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting sissy future, the police department is forced to bring an ex detective, also from the 20th century, out of suspended animation to catch this psycho. The movie starts out silly and cheesy, so we know we're in for something brainless, and it only gets more idiotic as it goes along.I probably speak for everyone when I say Demolition Man has the lamest interpretation of the future of all time. There is zero violence of any kind, zero cursing of any kind, and the only restaurant is Taco Bell. Everyone is a sissy and sheltered little pansy who would be afraid of any child over the age of eight in the actual 21st century. The biggest issue here is that the film indirectly promotes violence by showing how pathetic and idiotic a violent free future is. I even found myself rooting for the bad guy just to show all the other prudes a lesson. This movie sends all the wrong signals and makes me shake my head in embarrassment for it.The best thing going for this movie is its portrayal of just how dumb Hollywood can get. This film was just unimaginably stupid, but stupid enough to where it was actually amusing. There were enough laughs to keep me watching and my opinion of the film constantly teetered between unwatchable bad and hilariously bad. Basically, there is nothing intentionally good about this film. Every aspect of this film is so poorly constructed. The direction is bland and Hollywood-ized, making this another stale action film. The plot has holes big enough to drive an 18-wheeler through, and its probably better if you just don't question some of the moronic plot points of this film, like how the world went from violent and explosion filled to completely empty of violence or excitement, so much so that nobody alive even understands what violence is, in only 36 years.Then of course there is the acting which is what you'd expect. Stallone is himself in this film. He's the egotistical macho man. His acting in Demoltion Man is awful, but fitting. Wesley Snipes is probably the highlight of the film in his role as the murderous psychopath Simon Phoenix. He's wacky and over the top and does provide some idiotic entertainment. Then of course there's Sandra Bullock. Need I say more? Demolition Man is an awful, horrendous, brain cell killing schlock of cinema. Yet, I didn't hate the film. It was one of those movies that is so bad its good. I would never touch this film again with a ten foot pole, but I've honestly seen worse. When the film was over I wasn't completely brain dead, wanting to claw my eyes out and wishing I had never seen that movie. Instead I just laughed it off and that was that. Demolition Man is just one of those movies that is so very, very bad, but I don't even feel like complaining about it, because at least I got a cheap laugh out of it.",Demolition Man
76,ivo-cobra8,"A Cult classic, one of the best Sci-Fi action flicks of Stallone!",10,4 November 2015,"Demolition Man (1993) is one of the best epic classic science fiction/action film of all time! AN ALL TIME CLASSIC, has it all, explosions, practical effects, one liners, 80s songfests, soundtracks. It is one of my personal favorite movies. I love this film to death it is Stallone-Snipes futuristic science fiction action flick of the 90's. They don't make like this anymore.Demolition Man is my favorite best Stallone Sci-fi, action movie, very awesome alongside with Rambo films. Demolition Man is one of the funniest, most action-packed and most poignant social satires of at least the last 22 years. It's not necessarily the easiest film to appreciate, as it makes its points through extremely over-the-top ""mindless"" action and tongue-in-cheek, purposefully cheesy plot and dialogue, but it's well worth trying to acclimate oneself to the style if you're not an action or sci-fi fan, as the satire cuts deep. There are other films with somewhat similar aims, such as Total Recall (1990) and Starship Troopers (1997), which are perhaps just as good as Demolition Man, but they certainly can't top it, and they have aims other than the purely satirical. As a social commentary, it's extraordinarily on-target. I mean, come on, this is the movie where the joke was made that Schwarzenegger would be president and Taco Bell would win the franchise wars, and what do you know? Now people want the constitution amended so Arnold can run for president and Taco Bell is winning the franchise wars (they merged with Pizza Hut and KFC). One of Stallone's best Sci-fi action packed films. This film is phenomenal!Send a maniac to catch a maniac!!!!!!!! Sylvester Stallone is a legendary bad-ass cop John Spartan Demolition Man he plays by his own rules and he does what he does best to catch the bad guys. He will blow things up to get the job done and he does in this movie. Demolition Man defies my childhood and I love this movie to death! The cast, the script, the story itself all of these elements come together to make this one of the best action movies of the 90s. This movie does have a few surprises and it is not above making fun of itself or the action movie genre (Denis Leary is a wonderful touch!). It is a perfect addition to an action movie night or collection. The movie has humor, a little comedy and pure action that the gunplay is delivered in perfect Stallone-Snipes style - you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. Stallone uses hand guns including a Remington shotgun. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. The martial arts are excellent, so are the cryoprision scenes. Terrific special effects and art direction. Marco Brambilla did a great direction debut of directing of one of my all time classic sci-fi action movies! This is an action film that actually has a brain in its head and has something to say. The vision of future world here is undeniably original and memorable. What is more admirable is that many of things seen here are happening in REAL world. Demolition Man shows what would happen if the politics will went to far with it.Anyway I love this film, I grew up with Demolition Man, beside Cliffhanger is my second best favorite action Stallone movie!!! The rating I am giving is a 10, because the film isn't a 6, but it is a perfect 10. It is a film that is an underrated cult classic movie that I will always enjoy and cherish it to death!!!

Spartan is then revived in the year 2032 and finds himself in the city of San Angeles when Phoenix escapes. Spartan is then asked by the San Angeles police force to use his old school tactics to take down his archenemy. The film's cast also includes Sandra Bullock, Benjamin Bratt, and Denis Leary. The film is notable for featuring one of the first and only appearances of the Heckler & Koch G11, an experimental rifle at the time that was portrayed as futuristic magnetic pulse rifle. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",Demolition Man
77,The_Movie_Cat,"""I'll be subtle. I'm good at subtle.""",6,21 November 2000,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Can somebody please explain to me why I love Demolition Man so much? Because in every important respect its a truly terrible movie.Sandra Bullock's obligatory ""love interest"" function, contrived kookiness and addiction to the 20th century (Why is it that whenever someone from the future has an interest in the past the past in question is always the present date?) is trite, yet she has never looked lovelier. Rumours abound that behind the scenes she and Stallone couldn't stand one another, yet this isn't particularly evident on screen.Rob Schneider is just as irritating as he was in the similarly themed Judge Dredd, yet his part here is kept to a minimum and it doesn't seem to matter so much. Generally, though, the humour is garishly unsubtle, the satire concrete-thick and lacking in charm.The ludicrously exposition-led dialogue (guard being strangled to death: ""How'd you know the password to the cuffs?"") should also grate, along with the multiple plot contrivances. Yet somehow this is a brilliant movie. I doubt it's down to Stallone, who doesn't give 100%, though does give more than he usually did for the period. Then again, his role is largely reactionary, and while he does get the occasional funny line (Brainwashed while in cryogenic sleep, he claims after a fight that he can fix his shirt: ""All I need is a needle and thread."") generally he's a stoic straight man who gets feeble puns like ""you're on T.V."" while smashing Wesley Snipes over the head with said object.And Wesley is really what it comes down to. While he's normally about as bland as a Reeves or Van Damme, here he's gloriously over the top and plays his role with supreme camp menace. And while the opening scenes with their LA riot-referencing may lack the punch they once did, when Snipes is awakened during 2032 the scenes still carry excitement. I'd never normally praise a film on it's violent content, but that's really what makes Demolition Man so special. Not only does Wesley look and sound like he's really enjoying it, but he's so good at it you can truly believe it hurts. Heavily choreographed, the best scene is probably not with Stallone, but at the CompuChat booth where he demolishes eight policemen. (Although Wesley was later to answer claims that taking a bad guy role was detrimental to black image in film, and it's notable that the only black policemen in the piece are non-speaking roles; save for a token appearance by Bill Cobbs). Also armed with some full-pelt catchphrases  ""I'm a blast from the past!"" ""Time for something new and improved!""  Snipes really makes the most of his role, and carries the film.There are other small touches that are enjoyable, such as Bullock prophetically saying, ""while you were sleeping"", or Snipes' line: ""I swear I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached"", to be met by ""I'll bear that in mind"", which is countered at the movie's climax. There's the punning surnames for characters, especially Phoenix, the bird who arised from the fire. The direction and action, while generic and a little bland, is always fast-paced and imaginative, particularly the museum battle where both combatants go crashing through the floor. Vacuous, certainly, but colourful, vibrant and strangely compelling, Demolition Man is the perfect comic book for the cinema screen.",Demolition Man
78,ajs-10,A no-brainer... but lost of fun!,7,13 November 2010,"This has always been one of my favourite guilty pleasures, a sci-fi action thriller from the nineties featuring Stallone and Snipes. Lots of violence tempered with, it has to be said, a great deal of humour. Yes, I love the scene with the three sea shells who wouldn't? Anyhow, I digress Here's a short summary before I let you know what I really think (summary haters, the next paragraph really isn't for you trust me, you won't like it).The year is 1996 and after cop, John Spartan, destroys yet another building while pursuing psychopath Simon Phoenix, he is sent to be cryogenically frozen along with his prisoner. We then skip to 2032 where a Utopian society has grown up along the West coast of America after an enormous earthquake destroyed much of it in 2010 (mmm soon then). This society is lead by Dr. Raymond Cocteau who has created his own vision of what society should be like, and it's pretty lame! An underground group lead by one Edgar Friendly survives outside this society in the sewers under the city. Into this world the psychopath Simon Phoenix escapes cryo-prison with all the skills he needs to survive in this future world already downloaded into his brain while he was frozen. He immediately goes on a killing spree which leaves the Police, lead by Chief George Earle, unable to cope. The last murder was decades ago! At the suggestion of 20th Century fanatic, and cop, Lenina Huxley, they release John Spartan to track Phoenix down. Unfortunately, the Demolition Man lives up to his reputation and there is much more mayhem in the offing for the seemingly hapless police force.I really love the humour in this film, Wesley Snipes over-the-top performance and Stallone's stone-faced delivery are really enjoyable to watch. In fact, really good performances all round, particularly from; Sylvester Stallone as John Spartan, Wesley Snipes as Simon Phoenix and Sandra Bullock as Lenina Huxley. Honourable mentions must also go to; Nigel Hawthorne as Dr. Raymond Cocteau, Benjamin Bratt as Alfredo Garcia, Bob Gunton as Chief George Earle, Glenn Shadix as Associate Bob and Denis Leary as Edgar Friendly.This film is never going to tax the old grey matter too much, but I always find its good fun to watch. There is some good stunt work and some reasonable special effects, but I think it's the vision of the possible future I find most intriguing. As I may have already mentioned, I like the humour, but don't be fooled, there is plenty of violence to be had as well (definitely not a chick-flick). Recommended But I still have one question How the hell do you use the three sea shells? My score: 7.2/10",Demolition Man
79,TheNorthernMonkee,A no-brainer or a clever dystopia tribute.,7,2 September 2003,"SPOILERSOK, here we have yet another Sly Stallone action film, but perhaps this time is one with a different. There's absolutely no denying that deep down this film is simply violence with the occasional highlight of comedy. So what is it about this film which makes it so much better than your regular action feature?Truth be told, I confess I might be looking into this film too much, but the writers of this movie appear to have quite a knowledge of dystopia ideals. From the opening scene of 1994's Hollywood, with it's fire like tribute to the buildings from the start of ""Blade Runner"", this film proceeds along a similar route.Once Sly's ""John Spartan"" is frozen, the future in which he is defrosted is an idyllic future with no violence. This world of health, no sex, illegal swearing and minimal violence is developed by Dr Raymond Cocteau (played without any real need for passion by Nigel Hawthorne) is a dystopia world for simply the reason that it appears dystopia to us. Like other dystopia (Brave New World, for which this film obviously takes a few things, 1984, & Thomas More's ""Utopia"" to name three) the moral viewpoints and standings of the citizens are alien to us & we reject them. Yet, the vast majority of those in these places are perfectly content in these roles & thrive.The wonderful thing about this film is just how blatant some of the characters are named after books, people, etc. John Spartan or ""The Savage"" is obviously named after the Savage in ""Brave New World"" (also, by Greek standards, were the Spartan people also Savages?). As is Lenina Huxley (again played without too much effort by Sandra Bullock) who's first name is the love interest in ""Brave New World"", who's Surname is the surname of Aldous who wrote ""Brave New World"", and who's character is almost that of both Bernard Marx of ""Brave New World"" & of the female lead in ""1984"" (who's name currently escapes me).As well as the main two stars being named after characters in Brave New World, I found myself wondering if anyone else had names based on anything. Whilst unlikely, the only potentials I could think of were Simon Phoenix (the highlight of the film, played well by Wes Snipes) being a tribute to the idea of the Phoenix From The Flames and Dr Cocteau again. The name Cocteau is such an obscure name, it seemed worth doing a bit of research and the most likely link is that the character is named after Jean Cocteau the French Poet who promoted the avant-garde (irony in lifestyle choice but not outfits perhaps?) and who once said ""the worst tragedy for a poet is to be admired through being misunderstood"". It seems a probable, and clever link between the two men.I won't say much more as, it is really is a bit of a daft idea looking too much into such a regular action movie, but I do find it interesting that Spartan is re-awoken in a future in which he has an intense dislike and which he attempts to change (again similar to ""Brave New World"") & yet, as with so many American films, the American way of life always prevails. Don't get me wrong, I know I'd dislike living in a world without burgers, beer and sex too, but surely the point is that these people sacrificed a bit of their personal freedoms a few years ago and as a result also sacrificed crime. It's worth considering just which is more important. Security and less freedom, or too much freedom and the fear of suffering. Take your pick. Just don't think too hard, it is only an action film after all.Special effects good, acting adequate for the situation, humour occasional, constant Philosophical thought as a result of the dystopia ideals, a bit too consistent. But then again, I'm a Philosophy Student, I find questions in everything.",Demolition Man
80,Maziun,Underrated and misunderstood science fiction satire,8,10 October 2015,"The title for this movie was taken from The Police's song of the same name. ""Demolition man"" is VERY funny and charming sci-fi action movie that has also A LOT of substance . It's sad and annoying when people say that it's a ""so bad it's good "" or "" guilty pleasure"" type of movie. They simply don't understand what the movie is about. It's a SATIRE people ! It is intentionally cheesy and over the top to get the point across. Similar movie to this one is ""Robocop"" by Paul Verhoven. If you want to watch it only as a funny action movie that's fine , but you're missing the thought provoking questions here. It's an important philosophical movie done with tongue-in-cheek attitude. This is an action film that actually has a brain in its head and has something to say.The vision of future world here is undeniably original and memorable. What is more admirable is that many of things seen here are happening in REAL world. The world is obsessed with political correctness and ""Demolition man"" shows what would happen if we went to far with it. San Angeles is so nice and non-threatening that it's almost scary. Profanity , meat , alcohol and sex are outlawed. Radio and TV commercials are the pinnacle of music art in this world. Strict morality is enforced through constant computer monitoring of behavior.This is a movie about freedom of choice, about rights. If I want to eat unhealthy food allow me. Otherwise you are a fascist. A perfect world will never exist. The world in ""Demolition man"" looks perfect on the outside , but inside it's basically a totalitarian system. . The anti-utopian, anti-utilitarian political message, like that of George Orwell's ""1984"" or Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"" couldn't be clearer. Ask yourself - How much freedom I would sacrifice in return for safety ? Sylvester Stallone wisely plays is character with ironic distance and gives a good performance. Wesley Snipes steals the show as the villain with a Joker-like personality. Sandra Bullock is adorable here and her comic timing is great. I love how she is messing up all the colloquialisms. Denis Leary has small but important and fun role as the leader of rebels. Rob Schneider plays a police phone operator in a small role , but thankfully isn't annoying. There is even Jack Black somewhere in the sewer in cameo appearance.The movie is very funny. I love the humor and the sharp satirical edge .Who could forget the three shells. The dialogues are also good and filled with nice one liners. The Schwarzenegger library - oh man , this joke almost became truth ! In 2003, ten years after this film's release, Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor of California and shortly after his election, three senators separately proposed amendments to the US Constitution to allow naturalized citizens to become president. The script by Daniel Waters, Robert Reneau & Peter M. Lemkov deserves a lot of praise.Technically, the film is quite solid. The production design, cinematography, effects, staging of the action sequences, score and soundtrack are good. The look of the future as seen in Demolition Man is credible, right now we certainly have the talking cars, video phones & the CCTV.Marco Brambilla did a good job as the director . The movie is never boring , moves like a rocket and the blend of action and satire is perfect. The action scenes are suitably over the top & there are enough fights, shoot-outs, car chases & things being blown up spectacularly to satisfy action fans.Great light hearted 90's sci-fi action flick with a lot of substance and quotable dialogue. What's here not to like ? It's post-modernistic and accurate. I give it 8/10.",Demolition Man

84,Min111,Futuristic,7,13 August 2020,"I liked everything about the movie. It's a futuristic movie. I like movies that's to do with the future, and Demolition Man is one of them. The character involves John Spartan who's a police officer. Another character that's involved is Simon Phoenix who's a dangerous criminal - a pure psychopath. The two have been sentenced to be frozen. It's the year 1996. In the future, society is different now, and crime has been at its lowest point. The future is a lot different now than what it has been in the past. In the year 2032, Simon Phoenix has been revived, and is starting where he left off. The police officers today have no idea how to deal with such a guy. Soon, John Spartan is also revived, and his job is to stop Simon Phoenix. Can he stop him? You need to see it to find out. It has been thirty-six years which is a long time. John Spartan looks better than he always been. He's up for it. John Spartan was played by Sylvester Stallone who was an excellent choice. Simon Phoenix was played by Wesley Snipes who was also an excellent choice. Let's not forget another character named Lenina Huxley. She was played by Sandra Bullock. I can't believe how beautiful she was at the time. They carry the movie all the way. It's down to them why Demolition Man was good to watch. It's an action movie. It's a science-fiction movie. I only seen the movie because it was staring Sylvester Stallone. I'm a big fan of him. I liked his Rocky movies. When I saw the front cover, I just had to see it. I'm glad I did.",Demolition Man
85,TalesfromTheCryptfan,One of my all time fave Sci-fi action movies!,10,3 November 2017,"In 1996, a terrorist named Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) has been causing mayhem in L.A. until a renegade police officer named John Spartan (Slyvester Stallone) captures him but Spartan is framed for a crime he didn't commit during duty as both are convicted and suspended in cyrogenetic freezing suspension animation for a long time as Spartan has been sentenced for a long time, in the year 2032 36 years later, Los Angeles has changed into San Angeles which is a fusion of San Diego, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles is now ran by Dr Raymond Cocteau (Nigel Hathrowne) with his associate Bob (Glen Shaddix). The City has become a peaceful brainwashed loving society of people where things like chocolate/meat/pregnancy without a license/bad language (there's even machines where people are fine credits instead of money for using a swear word in public or anywhere)/gasoline and other stuff is banned and Taco Bell becomes the main restaurant for the city as it owns other restaurants. Simon has been unfrozen as he is on the loosing robbing and murdering others even stealing guns from a museum of violence. Chief George Earl (Bob Gunton from Shawshank Redemption) has worried about this as the police don't know how to handle this kind of violence which the cops have become non-violent, Lt. Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) who is nostalgic about the 20th century along with Zachery Lamb (Bill Cops) whom he was once a pilot for Spartan comes up with an idea to thaw out Spartan from his suspended animation slumber then thaw him out to help take care of this maniac. Spartan has awaken to find everything is different as he is trying to adjust to this new life he has now, there's also a radical group of rebels who live in an underground city called the Scraps lead by Edgar Friendly (Denise Leary) who believes in freedom of choice/speech as he wants to take down Cocteau once and for all but there is also something behind Cocteau unlike the citizens of San Angeles thinks he is.A very entertaining, well paced, action packed and fun Science Fiction action satire that is basically like the story of Brave New World with a hint of Blade Runner and Orwell's 1984 with a satire on what would it be like if the future went politically correct and if Taco Bell owned every restaurant. Originally Jean Claude Van-Demme and Jackie Chan were considered for the role of Simon Phoenix but the role went to Wesley Snipes, which i am very happy he took the role and this is my second fave role of his after Blade and nice to see him play a bad guy than a good guy like usual. Simon Phoenix with his dyed yellow hair and 90s jumpsuit reminds me of Duke Nukem only black and has mismatched colored eyes one blue and one hazel which was used by contact lenses. Stallone is fantastic as John Spartan whom is one of the most badass sci-fi characters around who is trying to fit in this watered down PCed society where real music is gone only underground when commercials are used for music even TV show themes are used for music plus when Cocteau thinks his Utopia is paradise and heaven when it's actually more like hell if you ask me. There's also a thing where people use 3 seashells instead of toilet paper, look online to see how the 3 seashells work.The movie is still relevant with the way things are going nowadays in the SJW/PC culture and is almost like a warning and statement. Plus the action is bold and thrilling, the future is well designed even the costumes and nice use of some practical effects with some interesting ideas/satire thrown in even about a commercialized future going PC and the dangers of it when freedom is needed. A must see.",Demolition Man
86,cardsrock,Action satire done well,7,7 December 2020,"You usually know what to expect with a Stallone action film, but this one strikes a different chord. The sharp satire of a extremely progressive, gun-free society where you get fined credits for cursing is hilarious, and actually scarily predictive of where our current society is heading. Snipes is clearly having fun in the role and plays well off of Stallone's macho persona. The action is a bit noisy at times, but it's entertaining for the most part. Demolition Man is an underrated action comedy satire that has become more prophetic as time has passed.Also, Taco Bell as the only restaurant left in the world? Brilliant.",Demolition Man
87,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,13 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""Demolition Man"" finds our two action stars, Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes, at the top of their game. Both were perfect for their respective roles and played off of each other brilliantly in a fun action film for the ages. If you've been following my reviews, then you know I am of this generation - and yes, I saw this one back in the day when it was released to theaters.John Spartan (Stallone), otherwise known as the Demolition Man - because of his destructive ways - is framed for the deaths of innocent civilians when he catches up to and captures one of the most notorious criminals of his time, Simon Phoenix (Snipes). Both are cryogenically frozen in a new state of the art penitentiary. Fast forward to the year 2032, and Simon Phoenix is thawed out for a parole hearing. But he escapes and begins to wreak havoc on a much more tame, peace loving community. The current police force is ill equipped to deal with this new threat, so they thaw out Spartan to bring Phoenix to justice before he can do any more damage.This movie is one of my favorite Stallone action vehicles. It is a solid combination of comedy and action with good performances by everyone involved. I loved its original premise and plot execution. Both Stallone and Snipes completely immersed themselves into their roles which the supporting actors fed off of. Sandra Bullock was awesome in an early role and held her own against these bigger names. The special effects were good and the pacing kept the story moving right along.I highly recommend ""Demolition Man"". I loved it back then, still love it now. There's only one thing I still want to know. How do you use the three seashells anyway?",Demolition Man
88,policy134,Completely nonsensical but still the best Stallone vehicle from the 90's,5,5 August 2007,"There couldn't have been a movie that made less sense than this futuristic action film from the once semi-great Stallone. Although, most of his films contained some kind of similarity to real life, Stallone here tries to simply put everything in but the kitchen sink.Still, you could do a lot worse than spending an hour and a half watching this somewhat unambitious action romp. The writers came up with a great idea: What if the world had become totally committed to peace and love and then an homicidal criminal maniac was released upon this world. What would you do? The answer: Release one man who is almost as maniacal as the criminal but on the side of the law.The criminal is played by Wesley Snipes, and he gives it his all. If it's just like acting like a kid in a candy store when he discovers that he has some unusual knowledge regarding jeopardizing people's safety or if it's slinging insults at his opposing foe, Stallone, here named John Spartan, Snipes is totally committed to behaving like an almost cartoon like creature. Picture Screwy Squirrel gone completely psycho.Stallone gets some good support from none other than Sandra Bullock, before she was considered a serious actress and from the late Nigel Hawthorne as a crazed version of Big Brother. Bullock has some nice moments as her character longs for a more uncivilized society and a cubicle at her workplace where the poster from Lethal Weapon is clearly on display (I wonder why?)Über-producer Joel Silver manages once again to send logic out the back door and stylish action sequences to the fore and you wouldn't have it any other way. You could say that this was a precursor to the much more ambitious, The Matrix.",Demolition Man
89,Java_Joe,Cultural satire that not many people got.,7,9 April 2019,"I was a kid when this movie came out and I loved this move for the action. It was over the top, ridiculous and could be enjoyed strictly on that level. But as an adult I came back to this movie and was able to see a bit behind the curtain at what they were actually doing. It's quite obvious in hindsight that this is a satire of action movies and a commentary on society and where it's heading.The story itself deals with two individuals. One is a crazy guy who runs around killing and destroying things for fun and the other is an equally crazy guy who runs around killing and destroying things for justice. The first is Wesley Snipes as Simon Phoenix and the second is Sylvester Stallone as Sgt. John Spartan the aptly named ""Demolition Man"". It's a title he's gained by effectively destroying things in his search for taking the criminals out. One time he accidentally lets a building blow up thinking it was empty but that's where Phoenix kept the hostages. For this they're both cryogenically frozen as punishment.Simon Phoenix is woken up for his parole hearing, he breaks free and goes on a rampage so they need to defrost John Spartan to take him out. Why? Well in the intervening time the world has undergone a lot of changes. Political correctness has run rampant, anything deemed bad for you is now illegal and the police are glorified security guards who don't carry guns are aren't trained to deal with violence.You can take this movie on the surface level and treat it like any other 90's hyper-masculine action flick and that would be fine. Or you can see what it was the writer and director were trying to say. And had Stallone not been cast in the lead role then maybe it would be seen as the meta-narrative it set out to be but instead it just became another Stallone movie.But take the time to look behind the curtain and you'll see a rather insightful and prescient commentary on modern life. I'm not saying that we live in a world like that, but there are scary parallels here and there that make it worth a second look.",Demolition Man
90,t_atzmueller,"""Demoliton Man"" could & should have been the better ""Judge Dredd""",7,17 February 2016,"If one takes a closer look at Sly's Vita, one will notice a certain wave-pattern (which is something that the careers many of our favourite 80's action-heroes share). For every ""Rocky"", there was a ""Stop! Or my Mom will shoot"", for every ""Rambo"" there was a ""Rambo III""; in short, despite being one of the most recognizable (action)-heroes of his time, his career had distinct ups-and-downs.""Demoliton Man"", in my personal opinion, would be the perfect epitaph for Stallone's career of the 1990's (until he would sort-of resurrect that career during the mid-2000). Actually, I consider this flick among my Top-10 Stallone-films. For various reasons: Stallone is still in great shape, Sandra Bullock cute as a button and Wesley Snipes is excellent as psychopathic villain (whereby it must be mentioned, in the synchronized German version I first saw, Snipes is given the same squeaky Mickey-Mouse-voice that almost all black actors were given at the time, including Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor. Though it sounds unlikely, that voice makes the villain Phoenix sound even crazier and psychotic than the original-language-version). Then you have a cast that is equally fitting, from a suitably annoying Benjamin Bratt to Shakespearian actor Nigel Hawthorne.Apart from the action, which is cream of the crop, suitably violent without being downright gory, I might add, the movie is witty and funny, without being silly or pretentious. Safe to say, lines like ""Murder-Death-Kill"" and the ""Three Sea-Shells"" have made it into popular culture. And yes, Sly's tribute to ""President Schwarzenegger"" made the audience cheer, probably a bit more (and in retrospect way more prophetic) than Arnie's slightly similar kiss-off in ""The Last Action Hero"".A few years later, I went to watch ""Judge Dredd"", which did seem like a good idea. Or rather, the concept seemed like a good idea. Most viewers will remember how that ended: a vanity-project for Stallone that, apart from the settings and costumes, had little in common with the comic-book and turned out a complete disappointment. Throughout the film I could help but to think how the ""Judge Dredd""-movie would have turned out, had it been filmed by the same crew as ""Demolition Man"" – it would have turned into the perfect adaptation of the ""2000 AD""-comics! In short: ""Demolition Man"" – again, this being my personal opinion – remained the last enjoyable Stallone-flick until Stallone, after a hiatus of being labeled an aging has-been and producing cinematic and straight-to-video-schlock, regained some of his former status with films like ""Rocky Balboa"", ""Rambo"" and, to an extent, ""The Expendables"". As it is, it's great popcorn-cinema and Sly's last fine offering in his prime-time.7/10",Demolition Man
91,Al_The_Strange,"""Send a maniac to catch a maniac.""",8,6 August 2012,"This film starts off looking like pretty standard 1990s action fare; you can expect to see lots of cheesy shootings, stuntwork, relentless explosions, etc. The twist is, as the main character is condemned as a criminal, he becomes cryogentically frozen, and is busted out in the future to combat his old enemy again. What comes next is not only more action, but a surprising amount of hilarious comedy.Most of the film takes place in a utopia that's so ridiculous and absurd, one can't help but to laugh. It's a future where Taco Bell takes over and the one and only restaurant in the US. The radio plays nothing but old commercial jingles from products long past. Sex is nothing more than a virtual-reality video game. Cursing is forbidden, and an alarm goes off every time a character swears. They don't even have toilet paper in the future! The key element, however, is that all things unpleasant have become forbidden, including violence. So naturally, when the ludicrously violent criminal Simon Phoenix starts rampaging across this utopia and upsetting the balance, the police decide to restore the balance by unleashing another 20th century brute: the Demolition Man. What ensues in between the funny encounters of the 21st century is a thrill ride filled with explosive, over-the-top action. With its fine mix of satirical comedy and thrilling action, the film appeals to all sci-fi and action movie fans.Most of the story has been described above, and it has its share of brilliance. The satire is frequently dispensed and often funny; regardless of how ridiculous these things are, the film plays it straight enough that it's easy to suspend disbelief. The film goes into some level of plotting and counter-plotting, but it's never complex. It's a light story that's easy to digest, and filled with likable characters.The film is captured with adequate, but never great, photography and editing. Acting is great from all the parties involved. Wesley Snipes plays the villain so hilariously well. Sylvester Stallone plays his usual action-hero schtick. Sandra Bullock is perfectly perk and peppy in her role. Everybody else is decent. Writing is not too shabby. This production has sets, props, costumes, and special effects that appear appropriately futuristic, but are not aging well. Music is alright.Recommended! 4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)",Demolition Man
92,AKS-6,Silly plot and mostly bad acting,5,15 June 1999,"This movie has one major draw-back: a silly plot. The premise could have been handled better than it is in this movie had the characters been more believable and likeable. As it is now, there is not a single character that is even remotely likeable, with the possible exception of John Spartan (Stallone). Sandra Bullock's Huxley is probably the most annoying, stupid, and silly female character the 90s have seen. And Bullock's very limited acting talent can't add anything to Huxley. Likewise, Stallone is not a very good actor (naturally, his fantastic performance in ""Cop Land"" is the exception). The real shame, though, is that Wesley Snipes is obviously not using more than 10% of his acting ability. The *good* thing is that Denis Leary and Nigel Hawthorne are as good as always.So, a silly plot, boring action sequences, and bad acting (with a few exceptions) makes a rather bad movie. Still, it is fast moving and at times very funny (Taco Bell someone?), so I *was* entertained, and that is probably the only reason why this movie was made (entertaining people), so I'm not *that* disappointed.",Demolition Man
93,bat-5,Goofy fun,6,27 November 1999,"Demolition Man is just good, goofy fun.  You plop yourself down when nothing else is on and watch Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes blow up everything around them.  Snipes plays Simon Phoenix over the top and that's exactly where he's supposed to be.  Stallone has some good lines in this film, and he's actually a funny guy when he plays things straight. Of course, no action film would be complete without the prerequisite snappy one liners, outlandish action and bullets flying everywhere.   A silly, but fun film to watch.",Demolition Man
94,DavidSim240183,A Stallone comedy that actually works!,9,28 June 2007,"Sylvester Stallone's various forays into comedy have been pitiful at best. Demolition Man is the single exception. In fact, it may be the best film Stallone has ever done. Because its a vehicle perfectly suited to him. Its an actioner, but also a very funny satire on Political Correctness gone mad.Beginning in 1996, Los Angeles is a war zone. Stallone is renegade cop John Spartan, nicknamed the Demolition Man. Spartan is assigned to rescue hostages from psychotic criminal Simon Phoenix (a platinum blond Wesley Snipes). Spartan gets Phoenix, but when he accidentally blows up the building with the hostages inside, the two enemies share the same fate. They both wind up in cryo-prison, where they will be frozen, programmed and conditioned to become productive members of society, and then thawed out at a later date.Shifting to 2032, instead of the dystopian vision of the future we were expecting, Los Angeles (or San Angeles as its now called) has become a peaceful society. The world has become a very happy place. A place of no crime, no hate, and no sex!! The benevolent dictator (if there is such a thing!) of San Angeles, Dr Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne) is none too happy that some citizens are not following his grand, master plan. Some people have broken away from society and live underground, wanting to live their own lives, led by fast-talking leader, Edgar Friendly (Denis Leary). Raiding the surface world for food and supplies, Cocteau wants them dealt with. And he has a radical plan. Thaw out Simon Phoenix to kill Edgar Friendly.Of course it doesn't work out that way, and Phoenix is far more interested in taking over the defenceless San Angeles, which rapidly becomes the war zone it once was. Since the police (SAPD) are ill-equipped to handle this, they come up with a radical plan of their own. Thaw out John Spartan to deal with Simon Phoenix. Partnered up with SAPD cop Lenina Huxley (a delightfully perky Sandra Bullock), in the hunt for Phoenix, they wind up tearing down the hideously nice San Angeles in the process.Demolition Man is a very funny satirical version of the future. Its observations are not as astute as RoboCop, but there are occasions where it is an action film of striking intelligence. The fact that the future is so nice and non-violent is a neat twist on what we usually expect from stories about our oncoming future. But the novelty is that San Angeles is so nice and non-threatening that it's almost scary. And just as frightening as any dystopia. From 1984 to Children of Men.There are lots of wonderful throwaway gags too, packed away into the background. There are too many to mention, but I like the neat little touches the film keeps coming up with. Like when Dr Cocteau holds a meeting, instead of addressing people in person, at the conference table are these little TV screens that swivel around as Cocteau walks about. And the cars of the future drive themselves. OK, that one's not so unexpected. But buildings that clean up after themselves! Bet you didn't see that one coming!Whenever Sylvester Stallone has tried his hand at comedy, the result is usually disastrous because he's seemed ill at ease with the material. But with Demolition Man, he looks like he's having a whale of a time. His utter contempt for San Angeles is very amusing, and I love the running gag of the monitors that fine you if you swear. Something Spartan puts to use when he can't figure out how the toilets work. Watch and you will see! A thinly disguised act of contempt against order.But the one major plus in the film's favour is the wonderful Sandra Bullock. It's hard to believe she was nominated for a Razzie award, because she's the best thing about the film. This is just before she found fame in Speed, and with Demolition Man, she displays comic timing of the best sort. Lenina's a supposed aficionado of 20th Century culture, something she proudly tells Spartan every chance she gets. But she only gets things half right. Messing up all the colloquialisms: ""You can take this job and shovel it. He really matched his meet.""Stallone and Bullock are a wonderful pair. All the most joyful moments in the film come from their scenes together. There's a really cute scene when Lenina takes Spartan back to her place to have sex. But in 2032, sex has become slightly different. Now there's no touching. Just virtual reality helmets to simulate it. Their wires get seriously crossed, and both Lenina and Spartan are baffled at what the other person wants (""Fluid transfer, yuck!"").Wesley Snipes is not bad in the part of the villain. He throws himself into it with real larger than life abandon, even if a lot of his puns are atrocious. But he handles the action scenes well enough. He could have done without the peroxide hairstyle though.And as for Nigel Hawthorne, well he looks a little out of place in the film. He's an actor who looks more at home on the stage or in a period piece, and I get the impression he's a bit uncomfortable acting in an action vehicle. Its a performance phoned in on his part, which might explain why he gets killed just a little over halfway through.But nevertheless, Demolition Man has much to recommend. It moves at a brisk pace, its funny and exciting in all the right places, and as action films go, its quite witty too. Love the snide comment Sly makes towards Arnie, who goes on to be President. Only intended as a pun at the time, but he's Governor now isn't he? Who knows? It could happen!",Demolition Man

Now called San Angeles (San Diego/Los Angeles, of course), the society is so nice that they deserve some violence. Enter Simon Phoenix, escapee from a cryo-genic prison. His type of violence (And incredibly violent at that) is new to these people, especially cops that handle such ""violent"" crimes as ""graffiti"" and fine people for using bad language. The solution? Thaw out John Spartan, the ""Demolition Man."" Frozen because he was framed in his attempt to capture Phoenix, Spartan is thawed out in a world that's gone vegetarian, free of bad language,sex,even toilet paper!

The question that the film raises (Believe me, even in this film, it does happen)is: would you prefer a perfect society free of disease and violence and full of happy thoughts, or a society of sex and violence? Edgar Friendly (Played wonderfully by Denis Leary)seems to want to live in the past (Our now) than the rather sedated present (Possible future?). Many similarities to Brave New World (Bullock's character Huxley (After the author)and the reference to John being a savage (Just like the character in the book.).O.K.

This lead to a quite interesting setting, with very imaginative ideas. It also brings forward a subjects that is still current: freedom versus security.The movie has a ton of action, opening big, lots of laugh, way too many easy quip from the protagonists, and an interesting story. The theme song is quite catchy. The costumes are well thought out, just like the architecture and the vehicle designs.Sandra Bullock sparkles with innocence, is beautiful, and extremely funny, probably the funniest of the cast. That film really introduced her to the big screen before making her splash in Speed.It's one of my favorite role for Sylvester Stallone. I like it when he doesn't play something too serious and yet kicks ass.

98,supertom-3,an action classic!!,9,25 March 2002,"This movie features Sly Stallone at his muscle bound, destructive best. Around the same time he did the excellent Cliffhanger he also did this nifty action flick. What you get with Demolition man is an entertaining and satirical look at the future of Los Angeles where people walk about in robes and are a peace loving society. Anything remotely bad for you, including spicy foods, is illegal and the whole new system is run by Raymond Cochtoe played by the late Nigal Hawthorne. The opening action scene is set in the present day and is a rip roaring sequence with Stallone polishing off bad guys with stylish flair, before he has a face off with the show stealer Wesley Snipes. Snipes plays the baddest of bad guys Simon Phoenix and does so excellently. The films pacing is good and in particular there are three big action sequences that shine, these are the opening and the end as well as a very good action scene set in a museum. The comedy factor is high in this film and the film certainly has tongue fastened firmly in cheek. The two leads are very good and in particular Snipes revels in his nasty role. Sandra Bullock is good as the gratuitous attractive lady you get in practically all action films. All in all this is a great way to spend 90 or so minutes and is certainly how I would like to remember Sly Stallone, in his action prime. 9/10",Demolition Man
99,malkane316,QUICK REVIEWS!,8,26 May 2004,"SPOILERS!!!I believe this movie, out of all the ones on this list, has the vision of the future I would most like to see. Clean, moral, peaceful-perfect, right? Wrong. Even in a future this idyllic, there are many problems, with corrupt politicians (can't escape them) leaving those who do not conform to his views, without homes, and ensures the world sees them as vicious, murdering rebels. Unfortunately, when 20th century super villain escapes from his frozen sleep, the future has no idea how to cope. The police are not trained in combat, and are only marginally stronger than the public, so when Simon Phoenix begins to wreak havoc, there can only be one solution: bring back the one man who could handle him. So out pops Stallone, and the old enemies begin their personal war again. Apart from the look the film, which is very attractive, the script, and the cast are extremely good for an action film. Stallone is funny, not even remotely trying to adapt to the future, Snipes is excellent in exploiting the weaknesses of the future cops, and Bullock is stunningly beautiful, but also shows her skill as a comic actress, messing up the 20th century dialogue she picks up from Spartan. Lots of effective action set pieces are balanced well with the clever script, with the usual mix of explosions, bullets and punches all used to exploit the plot, not just for the sake of looking impressive. 8 OUT OF 10",Demolition Man
100,johnnymacbest,Comic book-style fun.,7,5 May 2008,"What more can I say? This film is fun to watch and entertaining. The film has a strong comic-book like feel throughout. I mean, how wrong can you go with snappy one-liners with abundant OTT violence (though it should've been more brutal and realistic)and not to mention, tongue-in-cheek humor; especially the scene where Sly and Bullock have ""virtual sex"". Not only is it funny, but very creative. And Snipes is great as the bad guy who comes off as comical but still dangerous nonetheless and there's a lot of subtlety within the plot, but it isn't deep or philosophical as other sci-fi films. If you're feeling a little nostalgic then get this film and enjoy it for what it is: A big, loud, OTT, comic-book style film.",Demolition Man
101,jayjaycee,When Rambo arrives in the Brave New World,5,10 April 2020,"""Demolition Man"" is a 1993 action film directed by Marco Brambilla starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes. Due to popular demand and after having several intense discussions with other cinephiles who told me about this film I ultimately decided to give in to the peer pressure and watch it. Although I went in with an open mind and the intention to anyhow enjoy it, I just can't say that I liked it. Like almost every Sly movie from the nineties it suffers from poor writing and the frantic focus on style instead of having any notable substance. I was already wondering about how it wants to combine a vision of the future with an action experience lead by a man like him. I knew that it would not go out well. I mean, I'm not totally averse to futuristic films and especially novels. Actually, back in school I loved it when we intensively discussed dystopian literature and read classics like ""Brave New World"" and ""1984"", but in comparison to those masterfully written masterpieces, what would this film have to offer? I know, I should not be juxtaposing classic literature with a popcorn flick, but what am I to do when the film doesn't know about its nature as a mindless flick and tries to reach that exact high level? Exactly, the film really does try to compete with them and takes itself absolutely seriously. And that doesn't end quite well for this film. Even if it offers a lot of subtle and not so subtle nods to it influences (Lenina Huxley? Pretty clever), the whole concept is just not the masterpiece it obviously tries to be. Although I was impressed of how it scarily predicted some features of our society detailedly, such as video chat, self driving cars, devices similar to VR and even the shortage of toilet paper that leads the people to use shells instead (write that down, write that down!) there's still so much in it that is absolutely cheesy and cringe worthy on so many levels. From the way the greet each other to the incompetence of its police officers it felt like I was watching a Mike Myers parody of ""Brave New World"" instead of an serious pseudo utopian flick. The simple appearance of Rob Schneider didn't really convince me from the contrary. It would have been more bearable if it hasn't used most of its already way too long runtime to explore this embarrassing world and focussed more on the basically promising tension between the protagonist and antagonist. To be honest, while it was no Oscar material, Wesley Snipes was one of advantages of the film, as he played the villain with enough sass and coolness that I even began to root for him at times. Next to him, the acting of the whole cast was questionably bland and had me frown several time. Stallone is as always, but Bob Gunton and Sandra Bullock? The both can do better than that! If that was intentional it's still no excuse that it was nothing but terrible. There's still a difference between acting awfully on purpose as a stylistic device and just delivering poorly. I can tell you, the former wasn't definitely the case here. Another thing that bugs me about it is continuity errors and totally dumb plot holes. The anti-language device that annoyingly fines everyone who curses? Was already annoying in the beginning and gladly not further mentioned, to the disadvantage of continuity. Spartan throwing Phoenix out of the car in the chase sequence and leaving him on the road instead of actually putting him under arrest? Still doesn't get that. Even when the choreographies are decent, it's still nothing but forgettable shootouts, macho one-liners and senseless action. Contradictorily, it's all guns and violence and no brilliance even if that's exactly what the film pretends to be, thus it doesn't enable me to enjoy it on any specific level. Therefore, it changes its tone to much. All in all, this film gives an answer to the never asked question of what would happen when you cross ""Rambo"" with ""Brave New World"". It might offer some interesting approaches, but loses itself in cringe worthy details and its absurd story and doesn't really settle for one specific tone to follow. Action movies can be more than popcorn flicks, so that's no excuse. In the end, it's just a brainless fun I understand many might have extreme fun with, but it absolutely didn't resonate with me.

102,SMK-4,Devoid of original ideas,5,16 October 1998,"I have rarely seen a film so devoid of any original ideas as this one.  The movie references come so thick and fast, the film hardly consists of anything else.  I noticed references to Barbarella, A Boy and his Dog, Shogun, Zardoz, Buck Rogers, Escape from New York, Red Heat, 1984, Logan's Run, Robocop, Blade Runner, and none of these is even mentioned (at the moment) in the _long_ film references list for this movie.  These references aren't always blatant, but I had a constant feeling of deja-vu throughout, often wondering ""I have seen this bit before, but where?"".For example, the idea of contactless love-making (and that the real thing prevails) is directly taken from Barbarella, as are a few other ideas such as the ""weapons from the museum"" motive.  The organisation of the society resembles the one from A Boy and His Dog, even copying the physical link between the free & poor on one side and the over-organised on the other.The writers probably thought of this as an in-joke.  Or, possibly, somebody submitted the script as a joke to some Hollywood producers to see how they would react and they reacted by paying him a lot of money and making the film.",Demolition Man
103,OMTR,The Middle Path,10,21 August 2019,"""There must be a fair balance between two extremes"" is the message of this film, which is much more than an ordinary action movie.

The skillfully written screenplay is beautifully interpreted, and asks several essential questions, with intelligence, regarding what we want to do with our lives and our world.",Demolition Man
104,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Action-Packed And Thrilling SCI-FI-Action Film. Sylvester Stallone And Wesley Snipes At Their Best.",10,5 January 2015,"Demolition Man is an excellent,Action-packed and thrilling SCI-FI-Action film that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,thrilling Action,funny Satire and Humor and a memorable score. All of those elements make Demolition Man one of the best Action movies of the 1990s that is Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Shipes at their best.Set in the future in 2032 in San Angeles,California(what used to be Los Angeles)Demolition Man tells the story about 20th century criminal Simon Phoenix(Wesley Snipes)who after being frozen in suspended animation has escaped a Cyro prison and starts to go on a rampage. With nowhere to turn the San Angeles police department brings out 20th century LAPD cop John Spartan(Sylvester Stallone)who was also in the Cyro Prison and was the only person to capture Simon now Spartan has to bring down Phoenix again with explosive results.Demolition Man is a terrific and memorable SCI-FI-Action film and was along with Cliffhanger(also released in 1993)that was a Box Office hit for Sylvester Stallone that saw Stallone square off against Wesley Snipes and is one of the most entertaining Action films of the 1990s and is one of those movies that whenever it's on television you will always sit down and watch it. From beginning to end Demolition Man is a slam bang SCI-FI/Action movie that gives viewers entertainment in the highest order and is a Popcorn movie in the truest sense of the word giving viewers a great and memorable story with nonstop Action and thrills with Satirical laughs and Humor with an energy that just never slows down and when you watch the movie you are having fun. The Action in Demolition Man is amazing and intense and is done in a style that is wild with guns blazing and tons of explosions that grab your attention. The SCI-FI and Action genres while very different in style and tone go together well and Demolition Man is one of the best of it's kind and I think one of the reasons it's one of the best SCI-FI-Action films of it's kind is because of the different setting because where most futuristic Action movies are set in a Post Apocalyptic or dark Dystopian setting,Demolition Man takes place in the Utopian world of San Angeles(a combination of Los Angeles,San Diego and Santa Barbara)where people and things are clean and nice and everything is safe and the only restaurant around is a Taco Bell. It's also a world where cursing,sports,eating meat and drinking is illegal and the cops are soft and never use physical violence or force(they're not trained to handle violence)to catch criminals it's those things that give the movie a humorous and satirical tone giving viewers one of the funniest futuristic movies ever made and When watch DM you will probably ask yourself would you rather live in a Dystopian Post Apocalyptic wasteland or a beautiful futuristic Utopia with lots of laws? The humor and satire is funny and done with an ironic style because DM shows viewers a future where the people are somewhat naive and never had to see the chaos and may ham of the 20th century but when John Spartan and Simon Phoenix arrive the world of San Angeles is turned upside down and the way Spartan and Phoenix deal with the future is funny as well. When John Spartan sees the new world he doesn't really know or truly understand the new laws,technology or the way that people act or react to certain things almost to the point of becoming annoyed and wanting to being frozen. Simon Phoenix is the polar opposite using San Angeles as a playground to create violence and chaos while doing fine with computers and new technology and having fun with the cops. When Spartan and Phoenix get together and face off again the two create a fireball of violence that the citizens of San Angeles will never forget. The ending of Demolition Man is outstanding and Action-packed with excitement that keeps going and going and will have you cheering and smiling. An incredible conclusion.The cast is wonderful. Sylvester Stallone is excellent and at his best as John Spartan,with Stallone being charismatic and tough. Wesley Snipes is brilliant and memorable as Simon Phoenix,with Snipes stealing every scene he's in and having great scenes with Stallone. Sandra Bullock is terrific as LT Lenina Huxley,Spartan's new partner. Nigel Hawthorne is wonderful as Dr. Raymond Cocteau,the man in charge of San Angeles. Denis Leary is delightful and funny as Edgar Friendly,an underground going against Cocteau. Bob Gunton is fantastic as Chief George Earle,a stuck up police chief. Benjamin Bratt is fun and memorable as Alfredo Garcia,Lenina's fellow officer. Glenn Shadix(Associate Bob),Bill Cobbs(Zachary Lamb)and Rob Schneider(Erwin)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for a blink and you'll miss cameo by Jack Black as a Wasteland Scrap.The direction by Marco Brambilla is outstanding,with Brambilla always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace,style and look while doing an incredible job with the Action scenes. Great direction,Brambilla.The score by Elliot Goldenthal is terrific,stylish and epic matching the tone of the movie perfectly. Fine score,Goldenthal. There is also the great song Demolition Man by Sting that plays at the end.In final word,if you love SCI-FI-Action films,Sylvester Stallone or Wesley Snipes,I highly suggest you see Demolition Man,an excellent SCI-FI-Action film that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Demolition Man
105,TheHonestCritic,"This is one of the dumbest action films I have ever seen. But, does that make it good or bad? Check out my review below and see!",6,12 June 2020,"""Demolition Man"" (1993), when I first heard of this film, it sounded interesting. One of my friends said it had non-stop fighting and action from beginning to end. Being the good friend I am, I decided to check it out. Needless to say, I was kind of disappointed. Why? Because the concept had so much potential, and it suffered from a mostly lazy script and over the top execution. However, about ten years later, I watched it again and it was actually a little better. It has a good story, excellent sets/locations, and perfect special effects. The storyline, for me, is kind of a mixed bag. Either you love it, or you hate it. I'm right in the middle of the road about it. At first glance, it just looks like your basic futuristic buddy-cop movie. But, in the unique way it's presented and the fact it takes place in the future, somehow, the more you watch it, the slightly better it gets in that aspect. Maybe since we're getting closer to the year 2032, the year when the story of the film takes place, it gets better with age, in certain ways. There is one big nitpick, whenever one of the characters says a cuss word, there's a machine that buzzes and prints out a ticket. It was funny the first few times, but they milk it way too much to the point of annoyance. There is non-stop action all the way through, so they do have that going for them. But, it does get a bit over the top at times. All of the sets/locations are beautiful, and give this film a decent atmosphere. It really makes you feel like you're in the future! Finally, all of the special effects are well-done and still hold up to this day. There are two flaws in this movie; the acting and the soundtrack. Sylvester Stallone gives his usual tough guy performance, Sandra Bullock shines with her routinely lousy acting, and the rest of the actors and actresses are just bland! However, Wesley Snipes puts on a fantastic performance. He plays a brilliant villain in this film! Isn't it ironic that the best performances in bad movies usually come from the actors and actresses who play the villains? The soundtrack is dull, and gets kind of distracting at certain parts. It's just your generic and cliched action movie soundtrack, nothing special. This film had potential, and still to this day I have mixed feelings about it. I give this film a 3 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 6 out of 10 stars. A 3 out of 5 star rating is dividing mark where I differentiate a movie being good or bad. ""Demolition Man"" is a very marginal 3 out of 5/6 out of 10. I consider it to be a bad movie by my standards, and I can't recommend it. Perhaps it'll be better if I watch it again, who knows? Maybe it'll be more fun to watch it in the year 2032!",Demolition Man
106,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,The best sci-fi futuristic 90's action movie from Stallone to grace on a movie screen ever,10,26 October 2019,"Demolition Man is one of the best sci-fi futuristic action 90's movies from Sylvester Stallone to grace on a movie screen ever. It is Rated R for non-stop action violence, and for strong language It is my personal favorite action movie of the 90's. Belongs right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Sylvester Stallone is LAPD officer John Spartan the 21st century's most dangerous cop and Wesley Snipes is Simon Phoenix the 21st century's most ruthles criminal. This is a bad-ass futuristic action film it is in my top 15 favorite action films of all time. It is my personal favorite action film that is dear to my heart. I love, love, love this movie to death, it is right there with Rambo, Cobra, Hard Target, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Hard Boiled, Predator 1 and 2 and more this is a bad-ass, kick-ass action movie of all time. They don't make em like this anymore.""Send a maniac to catch a maniac""It is beautiful directed by Marco Brambilla he directed excellent this perfect action movie. I don't know what happened with the director after this movie he directed Excess Baggage (1997) than a few episodes of TV series and than he dissapeard it is really a shame a lot of good directors leave like that. It has great dilogue. Sylvester Stallone as John Spartan reminds me on John Wick played by Keanu Reeves that is why Stallone and Keanu Reeves are my top two favorite action actors that I love to death. I love the lines Spartan says: ""Somebody put me back in the fridge."" , ""You should've stayed there."", ""Do you have something to say, scum bag?"", ""You're under arrest, Phoenix."", Most of these guys don't like their own mothers. They're bad boys."" Sylvester Stallone's best performance as a renegade cop that get's framed and he must now in the future stop his old enemy Simon Phoenix who is on the loose again and is killing people. Wesley Snipes playes Simon Phoenix bad guy and barbaric ruthles killer. In my opinion Simon Phoneix is Wesley Snipes best role it is my favorite role he has done. Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes were decent actors. Sandra Bullock is so sexy gorgeous hot babe as Lenina Huxley even now day Sandra is still my favorite actress and I still love her. For the rest of the cast I don't care.With innocent victims caught in the crossfire in Los Angeles' intensifying war on crime, both cop John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) and violent thug Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) are sentenced to a state of frozen incarceration known as ""CryoPrison."" When Spartan is finally thawed 36 years later, it's 2032, and Los Angeles is now a pacifist utopia called San Angeles. But with Phoenix again on the loose, Spartan must team up with future cop Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) to apprehend the killer.The action scenes are great, they are well done even for CGI effects they are practical and they are real stunts. Here you have Stallone with two Beretta 92F handguns jumping in his two arms shooting at Simon Phoenix. That is bad-ass action well done scene. The CryoPrison scenes are well done, the future is a bad-ass. I did hear hear that people are complaining that it has humor and song fests in it that it is an awful movie. I disagree, it is a satire, so what. RoboCop, Total Recall and Starship Troopers have satires in it, but they are good movies and get's better credits but Demolition Man dosen't get better reputation I disagree.I love the opening sequence in which Spartan (Stallone) bungee jumps onto the roof of Phoenix' headquarters and fights his way through the structure, defeating several of Phoenix' guards. When Phoenix (Snipes) sees Spartan's approach on his security cameras, he grabs a dagger and punctures several barrels of gasoline, spilling it onto the floor. Spartan arrives and orders Phoenix to reveal the location of the hostages. Phoenix catches Spartan off guard, showing him the pool of gas and brandishing a lit torch. He defiantly refuses to give up the hostages and flicks a lit cigarette toward Spartan, igniting the gas. Spartan grabs Phoenix and runs out of the building while the flames ignite several barrels of C4 explosive. The building collapses just after Spartan makes it to safety. The building explodes that's was practical done, practical effect real explosion. Why can't they demolish a buliding like that today? The opening action scene is a bad-ass Spartan fights Phoenix gangs and fights off with Phoenix the only one who catches the most dangerous killer.The car chases are excellent dangerous well done: Phoenix steals a SAPD squad car and flees, Spartan and Huxley with an antique 1970 Oldsmobile 442 goes after Phoenix. During the chase, Phoenix tells Spartan that he'd already killed all the bus passengers in 1996. That is a real practical action stunt done. I love the night scenes more in here, this is really my favorite scene in the film. Spartan grabs Phoenix and throws him out of the car like he used judo grab to kick Phoenix out of the car. Spartan try's to stop the car but he flys in SLPD structure.I love how the future is done in this movie, how they build the town the Taco Bell and so on. I love that Spartan goes alone after Phoenix because Spartan knows he has to stop Phoenix from releasing cryo prisoners 80 killers. This is my movie, my action movie I don't care about the satire, or funny lines. Not every action movie has to be brutal.I am sorry I review this movie twice I hope I want get band again I love this movie to death. It come out in year 1993 Stallone was still in his best shape, he was strong and muscular. Cliffhanger was the first movie that come out before this movie. Jurassic Park and Hard Target come out the same and yes they are my favorite movies. I watch them all time, no not all the time but every year I visit them. Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal were offered lead roles in the film for John Spartan , but both turned it down I am glad they did. Jean-Claude Van Damme is Hard Target - Chance Boudreaux for me not John Spartan that is Sylvester Stallone. The role of Phoenix was also offered to Jackie Chan, but he turned it down, not wanting to play a villainous character. I am glad he did Jackie Chan would be terrible and not believable in the lead role. Lori Petty was originally cast as Huxley, but was replaced by a then relatively unknown Sandra Bullock after two days of filming due to what producer Joel Silver described as ""creative differences"". I am glad Sandra Bullock was in here Lory Petty would be terrible.I love the music score from Elliot Goldenthal the same score was later used in Batman Forever (1995), the same theme. I love Demolition Man soundtrack by Sting the music played on the end of the credits.Demolition Man is the best sci-fi futuristic 90's action movie from Sylvester Stallone to grace on a movie screen ever! I love this movie to deathI love it so much it is dear to my heart. John Spartan is my favorite charather ever played by Sly. This is my movie my action movie it means everything to me.

107,ReelCheese,Critics Are Too Uptight,7,4 June 2006,"A sometimes awkward blend of action, sci-fi and humor, DEMOLITION MAN is one of many big-budget, critically-panned Sylvester Stallone efforts. But it's really not that bad; in fact, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it all is.Sly once again plays a tough-as-nails cop, only this time he's frozen for 36 years beginning in the futuristic atmosphere of 1996. (These movies really have to stop picking not-so-far-off dates... how many old sci-fi pictures depicted flying cars and missions to Mars before 1990?). This was our hero's punishment for a crime, but one he naturally did not commit. Instead he was framed by his old nemesis (an effectively hateful Wesley Snipes). He's thawed out to get back on his enemy's trail once more. He must also deal with a real-life Brave New World of pacified cops, tickets for swearing and mysterious plastic seashells that have somehow replaced toilet paper.DEMOLITION MAN does not take itself seriously, and that's part of the fun. Between the chases and explosions one would expect, the film tries (and to a degree succeeds) to be a social commentary on the dangers of a Utopian society. As Snipes' character so eloquently states, it's wrong to take away people's right to be ""a**holes.""",Demolition Man
108,dk77dk,John Spartan And The Brave New World,10,24 December 2020,"Demolition Man is an underrated film that deserves more attention.The film is actually a satire set in a hilarious environment in the future where people are punished for swearing. Often a misunderstood film work that is much more than just an action movie, which turned out to be incredibly prophetic.The film is a brilliant satire that ultimately sends us a good message, that we should treat each other better.When we look at this story from today's perspective, it is interesting because of several things.In the film, society has degenerated into a kind of strange terror, where people are completely separated from reality, incapable of facing dangers and crime. Beneath the seemingly perfect society, lurks something sinister, and the film is a truly interesting satire that shows all the hypocrisy of such a structure.Humans have simply turned into soft pathetic creatures who are not allowed to drink, smoke, eat bad food and who are not even allowed to swear so as not to offend anyone.Quite interesting, because from this perspective the film seems almost prophetic, and indeed as such, it is extremely interesting and popular even today.The film is excellently directed, and Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes are great in their roles, and the whole film is full of subtle details that blend perfectly into one great story. The direction is great, the action scenes are superbly directed, and the action itself is bloody and brutal. Wesley Snipes is brilliant in the role of Simon Phoenix.Add to all that a fun cast, explosions, a lot of action and you have an incredibly fun movie that sends a positive message.",Demolition Man
109,basrutten,Brave New World.....,7,18 March 2002,"For Stallone, this is quite a good movie. Well OK, half of it is quite a good movie. The bad part of this movie consists of ultra-violent, over the top action scenes that you can see in nearly every other Stallone or Van Damme movie. This movie even glorifies violence, and has the questionable message that ""violence is sometimes right"".But this movie's saving grace is the setting: an ultra-politically correct feature where all unhealthy things have been banned, crime no longer exists and you get fined for swearing. In fact, it's almost a rip-off of the book ""Brave New World"" (Sandra Bullock's character is even named after the writer, Aldous Huxley). The movie really gets a lot of good jokes out of this setting and this is what makes it stand out above the crowd.Though by no means a masterpiece, this movie is worth a look.

110,TheHande,Mind-numbingly fun,7,2 October 2008,"It's always nice to see an action-film which doesn't take itself too seriously. Demolition Man, in a way, is almost a parody of a cheesy action movie. The movie's depiction of a future-society works as a bit of an intelligent exercise while the silly pop-culture references keep the film with a firmly tongue-in-cheek mood.Wesley Snipes provides a worthy foe for Stallone. Even though he comes off from time to time as a gag-villain, he provides an almost comic-book dynamic to the film which is what makes the movie so watchable.Undoubtedly at times the movie seems to degenerate more into parody and at the end it's difficult to decide if the movie's comical direction was necessarily a good move. At times it feels there's almost too much camp to bare. For this the movie may be a turn off for some, but for lovers of cheesy action comedy Demolition Man is a real treat.",Demolition Man
111,TheOny13,Demolition Man - Life Simulator 2020 Edition,9,28 August 2020,"Imagine this dear reader: Near future of 21st century in which society has evolved into a dystopia where every aspect of the human nature has been censored in order to not offend anyone, people forced by the law to be nice to each other and overall a world run by power hungry people hiding behind a mask of compation but who actualy want just to push their own agenda and gain more and more power. A world full of weaklings who have no power to adapt to struggles and adversities. Anything until now seems familiar?This movie is a typpical over the top action flick of the 90's with all the good parts you'd expect from this type of movies. At the same time this movie for me is a kind of a Nostradamus of the movie world, coredctly predicting the future of our society of political corectness, overzealous censorship and liberal culture. It's a film asking important questions about surrending personal freedoms in the name of security thus creating a world of weak people unable to adapt to hardship. I won't be breaking down the plot of this movie in order to point every flaw in it, but I'll be mentioning some of the weak aspects of the movie.What I really liked at first was the futuristic look of this movie. This film actually portrays a possible future not only from a mentality perspective but also from a production and architecture perspective. Top notch I would say. The practical effects are another thing of beauty in this movie. They are all gourgeous and give the movie a feel of realism unlike the marvelish type of movies we see nowadays. Next, the humor of this movie is fantastic, especially the scenes where the cops are so amazed by the prospect of murder-kill-crime after decades of not having one. Oustandingly funny! Outside of that the movie is competently shot, directed and edited. The music is also very good, sometimes over the top but not in a bad way since the movie is also very often over the top. The pacing of the movie is excellent, although many things are over exagerated it keeps you in it and there's a balance of action scenes and slower scenes in which you can get behind the characters.All these things are nice and good, but Demolition Man dares to pose questions about how impactful would be such a change to society in this manner. This movie gradually exposes the huge flaws behind the utopian fassage, a message and a movie that would absolutely not be made today. In a world where all deisres, ambitions and personal traits have been made obsolete in the name of general happines, apparently happy people are starting to feel unfulfilled and unable to cope with hardship. The thing is that every aspect of the world from music, movie to food and other stuff have been censored in the name of peace, harmony and safety. And the result is a weak, fragile distopia where no one is allowed to be bold or ambitious or controversial. A world run by supposedly benevolent technocrats who preach tolerance and compasion but only use these things as tools to enhance their own power. Man, this movie was really ahead of its time. On the other side there's also a resistance who rejected this fake utopia who live underground. Their presence grows more powerful as the movie progreses, hence they must be exterminated.The fundamental conflict in Demolition Man is one between lawless freedom and structured society and the movie ends by sugesting that the best way of moving forward is a balance between these two. It's not a perfect movie. There are still flaws in the narative like sub-plots that go nowhere and stupid things found out within the movie. But overall this movie is not only a great action flick, but also a lesson for the society and for the direction it goes right now. So, if you haven't seen it at all or in a long time, give it a try, it will certainly be worth your time! 9/10",Demolition Man
112,BadWebDiver,"Tight, fun action sci-fi",9,26 May 2002,"This is a great fun little movie.  It has well-staged set pieces, actors with loads of charm and personality, and for an alleged dumb-ass popcorn movie it has quite a few creative and imaginative ideas in the plot.  This is the way good summer blockbuster movies should be played.In fact, I would rank this movie as the one which comes closest to living up to the famous Samuel Goldwin quote of ""a film that starts with an earthquake and then builds to a climax"".  Well, it doesn't start with an earthquake exactly, but the pacing is full-on from go to woe, without ever looking forced or hackneyed.  And the idea of advertizing jingles becoming pop songs in an ""utopian"" future is very witty, as is the reference to Arnie Schwartznegger becoming president (maybe prophetic???).

It has all the cliches you can expect from 90s action movies, but the movie doesn't try to be serious, there are a lot of silly jokes, cheesy hero phrases and ridiculous shootings and explosion scenes, but they all add up to a lot of fun.
The cinematography is quite good, designs and setting are decent and acting... well, it's a Stallone movie!! Bullock does her job as the cute sidekick and Snipes (best of the movie) is what the Joker should have been in all the Batman movies.

I haven't been out to Los Angeles in the last 12 years, but I don't imagine it REALLY got as bad as the writers took the liberty of drawing up for the film.The action wasn't TOO bad, but the real attraction to this film, in my mind was the comedy behind it, such as whenever Stallone would correct Bullock's mis-quotes of 80's statements (i.e. ""Take this job and shovel it!""). But, in my mind, the one who stole the show, was Wesley Snipes! His delivery and timing in the film was good, and it seemed he never had to feed off of Stallone. It felt like it was more the other way around! I vote 2 1/2 stars out of 4.",Demolition Man

If they don't like movies, then don't watch them, simple. Don't whine about things you know nothing about without the cheese.This movie is one of the best 90's action movies around. I did think the comedy was a little too much in it, and should of not been in there, but it was one of the best movies, beside it. Two best action hero's of mine is Arnold and Sylvester.Other actors are descent, but not as good. Arnold is awesome, and he talks funny. So I enjoy Arnold. Sylvester is one of my favorites, because he is just good. Wesley Snipes is great too, but just under Arnold and Sylvester.I saw this in the theater, and at first time, I thought it was bad, but after watching it so many times. I got used to seeing it and liking it a lot.Watching it on television is nice to see it. Better than some of the other trash movies on television, and I bet those whiners like them trash movies over this. Geez, we got the weirdest and dumbest people now a days, that will say anything that just makes no sense in why they even said what they did.Yes, I am talking to those others about the seriousness of a movie. I will enjoy this movie the next time I watch it and after that too.As for Wesley Snipes as the villain, he is great, and as Stallone as the good guy, he is great.

And the beauty of it all is the seriousness with which the actors play their roles. Stallone and Snipes are two 20th century macho types in an Orwellian society where everything is monitored and the police are almost superfluous. Bullock is a radical thinker bored with her perfect society, and Leary is just trying to keep people alive...the people who decided they didn't want to be part of the Perfect society. Now it is worth remembering this film was one of the first shameless product promotion films, with Taco Bell being featured in the film as the only restaurant to survive the Franchise wars, whatever those were. I would classify it as a ""pre-comic"" movie, with all the trimmings...bad guys and good guys, technological oddities, and a lot of great lines. Worth seeing, PG-13 because of a few lines here and there and a couple of brief shots of nudity. Collectible if you like Stallone, otherwise rent it and return it.",Demolition Man
119,Benjamin_Cox,Strangely dated sci-fi silliness - 65%,6,13 April 2005,"Despite many miles of footage of sci-fi films and TV shows, the best thing about them is to revisit them after they should have happened. I remember my colleagues in school discussing the imminent nuclear destruction of the world on August 29th, 1997 (""Judgement Day"" as described in ""Terminator 2"") and going home bitterly disappointed after physics. Still, I always went home disappointed after physics... Anyway, those of you waiting for Los Angeles to crumble into a sky scraping broken industrial wasteland a la ""Blade Runner"" might want to take a gander at this - a straight-forward sci-fi actioner but with a bit more underneath the surface.""Demolition Man"" welcomes us to L.A. in 1996, a place where law and order has disintegrated to such an extent that the Hollywood sign is on fire. Cue beret-wearing super cop John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) who ends his two-year hunt for professional psycho Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) by blowing up a building full of hostages, as is his way. Now here's the clever part - both Phoenix and Spartan are sentenced to be cryogenically frozen (what?!?) and rehabilitated in their icy prison but sadly, Phoenix escapes. And the future is not really ready for someone like Phoenix - it is a peaceful utopia, full of quirky inventions and pacifist police officers like Lt. Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock). But it soon becomes apparent that the only man who can stop Phoenix's new reign of terror is the maniac sent to catch him before - Spartan.Even at the time of release, this was looking pretty dated. Stallone, in all the films he's made, only really acts in one and that's ""Copland"". Here, he goes through the motions as a foul-mouthed, meat-headed caveman (not really a stretch, is it?) in a world that understand him about as much as he understands it. And the story is terribly old-hat - cryogenics proved little more than an expensive fad (I even recall the subject appearing in an episode of ""Star Trek: TNG"") and to see it here in all it's neo-modern glory raises a faint smile. Something which most viewers now may find happening quite a lot. Brainless and formulaic it may be but ""Demolition Man"" is an unusually comic action film with no shame at all. It revels in being futuristically old-fashioned (how's that for an oxymoron?) but has one or two ideas up its sleeve. A good amount of time is spent away from the carnage as Spartan acquaints himself on our behalf in the future and this is time well spent. The fashions have that Gene Roddenberry feel to them but a lot of effort is spent on making this future society as believable as possible and that counts for something.Acting is mixed as only Stallone and Bullock have any real screen time. Snipes hams it up as the baddie but everybody else isn't taking it seriously at all - another good point as to do so with this film is sheer folly. This is for the popcorn-munching masses at the multiplex, a switch-your-brain-off actioner with all the grace and finesse of a brick being thrown through your car windscreen. The explosions are big, the dialogue is a little clunky, the action is satisfying. It does exactly what it says on the tin and if you're looking for anything deeper than forget it because it's not here. The quest to find a good movie with Bullock in continues but this isn't half bad, not as good as ""Speed"" (still her best) but it passes the time well enough. With a pinch of salt anyway.",Demolition Man
120,Jamie_Seaton,A good action film to chill out too,10,12 August 2009,"i really like this film even though it really isn't my style. its a bit cheesy and stupid but overall this film has a good story line and Sylvester Stallone and Wesley snipes are good too. john spartan, a cop played by ""Sylvester Stallone"" and Simon phoenix a criminal played by ""Wesley snipes"" are both cryogenic-ally frozen for crimes in 1996. Simon phoenix is paroled in 2032 where he escapes and starts running a frenzy of murder and destruction. in this imagining of 2032 everyone is very peaceful and no one commits crimes or violence. so the only thing they can do is defrost john spartan so he can go after Simon phoenix. the film is full of action and has a bit of originality to it which is good. Sandra bullock is also pretty good in this film as women who has been living by the new rules of this civilisation since birth but really wants to know more about the 20th century. i don't see why i have to say go and watch this because every one has most likely seen it, even people without TV's ha ha. so i'm just going to say that its a good film........ 7/10.......j.d Seaton",Demolition Man
121,sam_smithreview,Stallone at his best,9,24 April 2016,"The opening scene feels like a typical late 1980s/early 1990s action sequence. At least until we realize that there's not going to be a happy ending for the hostages that Spartan is trying to save. Once we arrive at the future, a lot of viewers might misjudge the performances of the principal cast besides Stallone and Snipes. Sandra Bullock, as Lieutenant Lenina Huxley (a reference to Aldous Huxley's book Brave New World)at first seem to be turning in bizarrely incompetent performances. It's only later that we realize they are spot on for the film's ""brave new world"", which is basically an imitation of a staunchly moralist cult run by Dr. Raymond Cocteau (a reference to famed director Jean Cocteau combined with Cocteau's friend, novelist Raymond Radiguet). This is almost a spin on if the world turned into a very soft world and excuses world.Demolition Man is one of the funniest, most action-packed and most poignant social satires of at least the last 30 years. It's not necessarily the easiest film to appreciate, as it makes its points through extremely over-the-top ""mindless"" action and tongue-in- cheek, purposefully cheesy plot and dialogue, but it's well worth trying to acclimate oneself to the style if you're not an action or sci-fi fan, as the satire cuts deep.Stallone does an excellent job as over the top old school police cop in a very soft future. He is pretty great at doing action/ comedy",Demolition Man

As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is ""better"" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. I was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it.

123,blazesnakes9,A funny satirical look of the future,7,13 July 2014,"Demolition Man is a different kind of science fiction film. It does take place in the future, yes, but it's humor is something rare for a film that is also action-packed. The movie begins in the year 1996, where John Spartan, (Sylvester Stallone), (who is nicknamed the ""Demolition Man"".), is being sent in a burning building to arrest and apprehend a notorious criminal mastermind named Simon Phoenix, (Wesley Spines). The arrest is successful, but Spartan left behind a trail of destruction and also is falsely arrested for the murder of a group of hostages that were located in the building. Spartan is sentenced to a cryo-prison, where they genetically freeze jailed inmates. Phoenix is also brought in the cryo-prison for his criminal behavior. The two men lay dormant for a certain number of years, until.....Fast-forward to the year 2032. Los Angeles has become San Angeles. Phoenix is set to be released, but he escapes and goes on a rampage, terrorizing the citizens of San Angeles. It's up to the San Angeles Police Department and the chief of police, (Bob Gunton), to unfreeze John Spartan and have him catch Phoenix before he causes more damage. Unfortunately for John, he is not at all adaptable to the new future. In this future, you can't swear because you will be fined and also you can't have actual sex because of bodily transmissions and functions. Spartan is also given a female partner, Lenina Huxley, (Sandra Bullock), and another named Alfredo Garcia, (Benjamin Bratt). The movie is funny in its own way by creating a future that uses cultural references as humor. The production design of San Angeles is very well done and very good. I especially enjoy and like the way the Sylvester Stallone's character is unable to fit into this new world. There is one scene in which Stallone can't seem to understand how to use the three seashells. I thought that was very clever and hilarious.As for the performances by Stallone and Snipes, I admired the supporting performances by Sandra Bullock, Nigel Hawthorne and Dennis Leary. Hawthorne plays a devious corporate leader who shuts out the underground society that lives underneath San Angeles. And then there's Dennis Leary playing the rebellious underground leader who is force to live in unclean and unhealthy conditions. As for Sandra Bullock, she is very good as Stallone's female partner. She doesn't override her character with her funny and giggly appearance in the film. I think she also creates some of the film's humor when she is working with Stallone.The action in Demolition Man borders on cartoon violence, especially when Stallone and Snipes battle each other off in a museum and at the end of the movie. At certain times however, I felt that the violence increased the level of humor. It's also as if this movie doesn't take itself seriously by satirizing future values. But, still, there's a goofy and fun sense that this film generates and it is very well done.Most science fiction films serves no hope for the future. In Demolition Man, that kind of criticism is invalid. This future society is very quirky and witty in its own right. I like science fiction movies that do take place in a future world where it is dark, depressing and filled with a sense of dystopia. It's rare to find a film where the future is very close to our own. And in the case of this movie, it is very close. In fact, I would like to get lost in San Angeles.All in all, the movie is a funny satire on future values and it is a whole lot of fun to sit through. It isn't perfect because of its predictable ending and story, but it is entertaining at its best. ★★★ 3 stars.",Demolition Man

We're police officers. Were not trained to handle this kind of violence. There's so many greats that I could go all day.
Stallone is good in this, but Wesley Snipes is unforgettable. One of the best villains ever. Let's not forget a young Sandra Bullock.
This movie was awesome back in the day. Guess what? It's still awesome in this day.",Demolition Man
125,talllwoood13,pretty well,7,1 October 2021,"I actually liked this. I wasn't expecting much in all honesty as I'm not a sci-fi movie person but thankfully no aliens or any nonsense. Wesley Snipes character worked out a lot better than I thought it would and the movie has a great atmosphere you'd believe for a second people would live in.The movie starts in 1996 and John Spartain this super cop they call the demolition man goes in to stop this over the top criminal Wesley Snipes and the place blows up but he drags out Simon Phoenix out and Simon just says one thing and bam! Sly is frozen for 30+ years just like him. The year is now 2046.Nothing really to say about Sylvester Stallone. He's played this role 100 times. The real star of the show is Wesley Snipes. He looks like something out of.the Jean Claude Van Damme movie Double Team or Ruby from the Fifth Element movie that Chris Tucker portrayed. His awful haircut and unnecessarily blonde hair is the star of the show as well as his over acting at times and sexual tension he blesses everyone with.Some reason the police station looks like something out of Bioshock 2 near the end of the game or Goldeneye on N64 the control level which is every elite gamers favorite level. When John wakes up in this new world it's like everyone got in Wesley Snipes weed drawer. They are all on some really good stuff. They can't curse, do anything unhealthy, eat spicy food to name a few things, they even blame ""Bodily fluid exchange"" for all the wars and so forth. It's kind of refreshing to see Sly curse so much in this movie. I am honestly surprised how unpopulated the future is. However what I couldn't understand is why is freezing everyone and filling them up with all this rehabilitated nonsense while they are frozen supposed to make them better people? Though they have a lot of fun with this concept.The chief all I can really say for him is he looks like the jetsons character Mr. Cogswell. In fact he may be turtliy enough for the turtle club. I guess times got hard when he couldn't get people in the six flags bus.Lenina Huxley played by Sandra Bullock plays this cop who is obsessed with the 90s. She seemed to be a hipster before hipsters were a thing. Yet there are no apple products. Maybe the future learned something.. maybe there is hope. Either way. How she approached this role at times she is incredibly naive to the point you'd think she is in a cult. It works. Yet at times it seems like she has the skills of an unenthusiastic shy middle school kid who has to tell everyone what they did during the christmas break. Or a netflix original .. I mean a high school play how little acting skill there is.What I can't understand is they are charging credits for cursing but never really do anything about it. One thing I'll take most from this movie is the facial tracking tvs and you need a license to even consider being pregnant. This should be implemented as the worlds population exceeded 7 billion people give or take. Plus yeah the sea shells! I love how Sly would rather curse until he gets his improvised toilet paper.How this society works is that they all have chips in their hands that controls them so when they do bad stuff it easily gets them caught.Raymond Cockteau is put on this pedestal because he created them. The actor playing him it seems his motivation was to be a watered down Genie from Aladdin with Robin Williams it seems, it gets annoying fast. The chip idea a unique concept but if 2019/2020 taught us anything people struggle to get vaccines for polio to a certain phenomenon in 2019 that shall remain mask I mean nameless. What I don't understand about his motivation is it seems this is the world he envisioned, yet he wants to destroy it to make what he really, really wants. Fine dining is pizza hut or it can be other fast food places depending on where you live which was a nice touch. All the other restaurants don't exist on the surface.I have no idea why the guns in the museum are loaded.The people under the surface are equivalent to the mutants in Futurama. They call them scraps. How disheveled Denis Leary looks I honestly thought he was Viggo Mortensen. I was going to make some jokes about Lord Of The Rings not paying good enough. Denis was born to play the role.I love Huxley's apartment. Yet the recessed into the floor couch (couch pits) were more prominent in the 1960s or 1970s. Maybe she got her 90s information from wikipedia. You know! The most reliable website on Earth. Right up there with Reddit and WebMD. Their version of contact free sex they were on some good drugs. Come on guys get out of Wesleys stash! He's gonna flip! This is another movie with the voice activated lights and so forth though so it's a nice touch at least we got something right that the movies predicted. However the way Sly is dressed when he is in his own apartment seems like something Steven Seagal's maid put too long in the dryer and it shrunk 4 sizes.When Wesley Snipes gets to pick all the people he wants to unthaw they are all people Sly put away. It looks like a Compton family reunion. I'm sure we can all pick the ending a mile away what happens but they do a fantastic job of doing so. I'm still putting spoilers though.I can't help if that hat was used in Street Fighter the movie that Sly wears in it. If so I wonder if this is before or after the Maramite stains and the Belgian lust. Why the heck did Wesley choose to do that scene with an uzi. That is like trying to hunt a bear with a slinky. Ok now I'm in Wesleys stash!The reason this didn't get a 10 which is possible from me but. The last half hour of the movie could have been paced a bit better and seriously. Both Phoenix and John can't shoot each other once? The more this movie goes on the more it annoys you. It's like two legally blind people want to kill each other. They end up doing hand to hand combat and boosh! Fatality!Some people that surprised me in this movie are Rob Schneider, Jack Black from school of rock and any other role that needs a short fat annoying guy instead of just a regular annoying guy like Rob and Jesse Ventura the wrestler.I'd probably see this again, it's fun, it's somewhat original poking fun at society as we know it. Be well and don't forget your 3 sea shells.",Demolition Man
126,R_O_U_S,Funny and exciting,9,20 February 2004,"John Spartan is a cop in the near future whose apparent accidental killing of a building full of hostages sees him cryogenically frozen alongside his nemesis, Simon Phoenix.  Both re-awake many years later to find an America where crime is unknown, all restaurants are Taco Bell, commercial themes are respected music and toilet paper has (somehow) been replaced by three seashells.  This is, simultaneously, a decent action movie, an interesting science fiction premise and a raspberry to the theory that Stallone cannot do comedy.

127,MovieLuvaMatt,I still enjoy this movie,7,31 March 2004,"I liked this movie when I first saw it, back when I was about 10 years old, but I wanted to see how much I'd like it now that my taste in cinema has heightened.  As it turned out, I did.  The premise is original and there's some great fish-out-of-water humor.  I love the scene where the police approach Simon Phoenix after he just murdered someone.  Since they're not used to arresting people for murder in this peaceful future, the police are instructed in a very elementary manner about how to approach the killer. And I still like the gag about the three seashells, and Stallone instead deciding to curse over and over again, so he could use the tickets as toilet paper.  Stallone is always enjoyable to watch, and it's fun to watch him belt out his one-liners, like all good action stars do.  Wesley Snipes is completely over-the-top as Phoenix, but his intention was to play a villain straight out of a comic book, and he seems to have a lot of fun with the role.  Plus, the theme song, by Sting, is way cool and it sucks how they don't show the credits during TV viewings, because I don't get to hear the song.  If you're looking for good, fun action entertainment with laughs to spare, this is the movie to watch!My score:  7 (out of 10)",Demolition Man

He is awakened several years later because his arch-nemesis (Wesley Snipes)was also awakened from suspended animation and the pacifist future cops have no clue how to stop him. Stallone's rough ways do not bode well for those in charge but he is worshipped as a hero by his new partner (Sandra Bullock). Great exchanges of dialogue and action scenes between Stallone and Snipes.

131,Danimal-7,Only Stallone movie I have ever loved,8,13 September 1999,"DEMOLITION MAN is a sci-fi comedy so hilarious that it compensates for the brain-dead action sequences mandatory in any Stallone movie.John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) is your stereotypical super-cop who is sent into the burning war zone of 1999 Los Angeles (OK, so the movie got dated a bit quickly), where he must rescue some hostages taken by mad criminal Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes).  Spartan captures Phoenix, but Phoenix manages to frame him for the mass murder of the hostages.  Both men are sentenced to life imprisonment frozen forever in suspended animation.Cut to forty years later.  Los Angeles has become a new society (with many a wink and nod to Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD) in which violent behavior is completely unknown and human relations are strictly controlled to eliminate drugs, alcohol, unhealthy food, swearing, and even sex! (I guess the population is maintained by artificial insemination).  Suddenly, by some strange act of sabotage, Simon Phoenix is released.  The 21st century police, are, to put it mildly, unprepared to deal with a 20th-century criminal.  At the suggestion of policewoman Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) John Spartan is thawed out and sent to catch Phoenix again.The comic sparks that fly as Spartan butts heads with this completely alien society are magnificent.  Every time Spartan curses, a machine issues him a ticket; Spartan's reaction to this problem is hilarious.  Bullock doesn't exactly show huge talent as Lenina Huxley, but she doesn't really need it to make this character funny and engaging, in love with her cliched and distorted vision of the 20th century just as some of us are with the Old West or the Age of Chivalry.  One of the running jokes is that she has not quite mastered the 20th-century jargon she loves to spout.  One of my favorite parts is a 20th-century telecast showing Spartan, who has just rescued a little girl from her kidnappers, being interviewed by a browbeating TV reporter; the response to this reporter is classic.  The script wisely does not call for Stallone to stretch his meager acting talents; he's funny just being who he is, so wildly out of place.Unfortunately, DEMOLITION MAN wants to be an action film, and the action scenes are every bit as bad as you would expect from a Stallone picture. Some repellent violence (i.e. a de-oculation) is jarring and unjustified in this essentially humorous movie.  The fighting between Phoenix and Spartan is your usual collection of dumb one-liners and experienced gunmen missing each other constantly at short range with automatic weapons.  Snipes is a redeeming feature; he is obviously having the time of his life playing Phoenix, and is generally fun to watch.  His malevolent stare is sometimes quite scary.  It's a shame he wasn't given a bigger share of the comic material.DEMOLITION MAN is well worth renting for its brilliant original laughs.  The material is not new, of course, but the comic approach to it is.  This movie may not be MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, but a laugh is a laugh and you shouldn't be too proud to enjoy the laughs DEMOLITION MAN has to offer.  By no means should you see this movie on broadcast TV, as many of the best parts are routinely edited out.Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.",Demolition Man
132,ogdendc,Be Well!,9,30 October 2013,"This film is an attempt to combine a Sylvester Stallone/Wesley Snipes action movie, a Sandra Bullock comedy and an intelligent parody of a classic piece of literature, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World.In Brave New World, the setting is AD 2540 where the population is unified under a peaceful, stable global society in which goods and resources are plentiful and everyone is happy. Natural reproduction has been done away with and children are created by test-tube methods. Sex is a social activity, rather than a means of reproduction. Education is via subconscious messages that mould self-image and social outlook to that chosen by the leaders. There are also securely contained groups of 'savages' left to their own devices. The main characters are Lenina Crowne, Bernard Marx and John the Savage.In Demolition Man, the setting is AD 2032 where the population is unified under a peaceful, stable global society in which goods are plentiful and everyone is happy ('Be Well'). Sex has been done away with (ugh! Fluid transfer!) and criminals are frozen in a cryoprison where they are moulded by subconscious messages to make them more docile when they are eventually released. There are also securely contained groups of 'scraps' living outside of society and left to fend for themselves. The main characters are Lenina Huxley and John Spartan ('you're a savage, John Spartan').Given the parallel scripts, the title seems to be a throwaway. It's as if some executive had said, 'We can't call it that. Give Sly's character a nickname and then use that for the title. Demolition Man? That'll do.' I'd have called it Brave New World.As a comedy, it works pretty well. The gag of the 'violation of the verbal morality standard' and the issue of a ticket, is carried throughout the film. Well done for sticking with that. It gives the film its biggest laugh when John Spartan discovers that the use of toilet paper has been discontinued during his 37 year incarceration in cryoprison. But the ticket machine can provide a replacement. Another gag is Lenina Huxley's mis-use of 1990's phrases despite being a fan of that period of history. And the ratburger scene is funny.As an action film, there is plenty of violence (Murder Death Kill) and explosions. So all in all, this is a pretty decent attempt at a complex project. Probably Sly's best comedy, Bullock's best film (OK, second best) and Wesley Snipes is brilliant as Simon Phoenix, rising again from the cryoprison.Some lines are not pursued. For instance, little is made of Spartan's conditioning during his imprisonment (knitting) compared to Phoenix's (strength, torture methodology, martial arts, weaponry and information technology). I'm sure there could have been more laughs there. And why introduce a subplot about Spartan's daughter only for it to lead nowhere? But these are minor quibbles and this is very watchable, even on a repeat viewing.",Demolition Man
133,KillerLord,Classic Stallone Action,9,8 May 2007,"One of the really good movies of Sylvester Stallone! A role perfectly made for him, he plays a cop hell bent on capturing the bad guys no matter what the cost and really, no matter what the cost! And starring with him is ""the"" Wesley Snipes who plays perhaps one of the best villains of the Hollywood action flicks. Wesley Snipes plays the role of Simon Phoenix, the one guy who will do anything to get what he wants  very brutal, cold-hearted and sadistic. And yes, Snipes plays him with perfection.Most of the movie is set in the fictional future which some people have learned to adapt for its goodness and all others have learned to hate for there is no freedom of choice. And now Stallone and Snipes play two people who are simply not accustomed to this future. The movie brings about their alienation perfectly. One of those roles where Stallone gets to do a little bit more than silent snarling.The comedy elements in this movie are really good. You would, if you remember discuss some of the funny elements of the movie post watching it. But the best part is the action sequences. Snipes and Stallone literally make the whole city their personal battle ground and bring chaos and destruction. Guns, explosions and punches!

Maybe, for us and John Spartan it might not be a great society. The people who live in this city seem to be happy with it as it is regardless of our impression. In the first few minutes you get to see the police station that is needed to uphold the law in this society. It is large, it is huge, it is far larger than one would need in a time of peace. Remember, they don't know about the malcontent.In this society the law officers forgot how to enforce law without being 100 percent PC and polite. By all appearances society is well behaved and shouldn't need a large police force. At the same time the citizens wouldn't even think of disobeying an officer. Citizens are the prime example of a peaceful society. That is until you start to look at the personalities of the modern society. The secondary actors show anger, deceit, and other unsavory human characteristics. You would think this movie fails miserably, but it doesn't. The contrast makes for a good setting for the now and old to converge into this action movie.

The advanced tech seemed very realistic for the time and the story itself was very original. The action scenes and stunt work were very big budget with nothing held back.

138,SamRag,The ultimate popcorn movie.,8,12 August 2002,"I don't care what anyone else says, I love this film.  The humor and futuristic setting is brilliant.  I find, that when action/comedy movies are made that don't take themselves too seriously, the result is often a very good entertainment (another example is Hard Target).  Here we get to see Sylvester Stallone at his best, playing an action hero while making fun of himself.  But at the same time we see great fighting, with Wesley Snipes showing off his kung-fu expertise.  The script is very good in the sense that we constantly receive laughable one-liners, especially good when Stallone has to deal with his new skills in knitting and sewing.  Of course this is no Oscar winning film, but pure entertainment, and should be viewed with that in mind.  If there is anything I could really criticize about it, it is not the movie itself, but the Pizza Hut/Taco Bell advertisement, where they created two versions of couple of scenes in the movie for the pure purpose of advertising fast-food chains (or so I've heard).  To close with, in the movie Stallone's character is astonished to find out that Arnold Schwarzenegger was at one point the president.  The funny thing being that now Arnold is planning on going into politics, and who knows; maybe one day we will see one more example of parts of futuristic films becoming a reality!  8/10",Demolition Man

144,m0rg16,Boooring.,4,2 January 2004,"I didn't enjoy this film very much at all, and that's coming from someone who's pretty much enjoyed every other Sci-fi film he's ever seen. This film was just... dull. First of all, its an action film. Sure, no problem there. But the action in this movie is pretty dull. Most of the time its simply two guys shooting at each other from behind obstacles, which can get pretty boring. And the rest of the fight scenes aren't much better either, being slow paced and rarely interesting since you know what the outcome of the fight is going to be every time. Some action scenes looks like they must have cost a fortune though. To bad, cause due to bad editing, most of the action scenes also look like something out of a early western film with 0% choreography. Not good.The film promises to be an action film, but when you watch it and realize that the action in the film isn't really enough to keep you interested you keep rooting on the plot. Unfortunetly, the plot is pretty weak as well. But I'll tell it to you anyway: A police officer and a psychopath are both cryogeneticly frozen as punishment for their crimes. In the opening scene we learn that these two guys hate each other. But that's all. We don't learn anything else. Oh well, you say, its an action film. Yeah, it is. But a boring one. It turns out 36 years later, in the year 2032, the psychopath is released for reasons unknown (but they become clear later) and starts to wreak havoc in the city. But the police of the future are simply eh... peacekeepers? It amuses me why someone would even consider being a police officer in a future such as this, when there are no crimes whatsoever. And the only crimes that do happen are when the so called 'scraps' (think: rebels oppressing the evil futuristic goverment) come up from the underground to steal food. But the police never interferes there. Weird.Anyway, back to the plot: The police is helpless against this psychopath and their only choice is to reanimate the cop who was frozen along with the psycho. The cop and the psycho hate each other and duke it out for the rest of the movie, yada yada yada. Do I even have to tell you who wins?
Anyway, the plot works along with the action scenes in the way that its boring and not very sparkling at all. The only thing that even wakes the slightest interest in this movie is the humor. Every once in awhile something new about the future is introduced to our time-traveling hero and he has to battle it in his own way, wether it is the way they wipe their butt in the future, or the way they have sex. Some smiles and some chuckles. But for this movie, that's it.Not even the acting is very good. Sly Stallone does an OK job as the time traveling cop, whereas Wesley Snipes performs pretty badly for himself. Why does he do this? We know he can act better than this. Perhaps he didn't really feel engaged enough in the story or in his character. Figures, as it isn't developed at all. All we get to know is that he is bad and hates Sly Stallone. That's it. Sandra Bullock is OK as well, but sometimes you just cringe when you hear her deliver some of her lines. Bad, bad, bad.Well, that pretty much sums up this movie. Uninteresting, boring yet somewhat funny. But still not enough to want you to see this film. Do not see unless you're very bored, and even if then, try to find something else.

145,timefreezer7,A must - see for sci -fi fans,9,29 May 2001,"My goodness !!! I have just seen this film for the 8th(!) time and I was still thrilled by this excellent futuristic story . Not to mention that I STILL found new things I didn 't notice before . If this does not make a successsful movie what does ? It is extremely underrated simply because it is an S. Stallone film . Too bad because it should be regarded a classic . Most of the action scenes are nothing special : continuous shooting between the 2 opponents , noisy and sometimes irritating . But the point of Demolition Man is NOT the action but the way it manages to create an entire universe . The story is this : John Spartan (Stallone) is a dynamic cop who finally manages to catch a fiendish criminal called Simon Phoinix ( Wesley Snipes ) in 1996 . However he was considered responsible for the deaths of Phoinix 's hostages. As a result both of them end up in cryonic prison where they are frosted in order to be improved trough synoptic suggestion . In 2032 Phoinix escapes more violent than ever. The society is utopic . Not only crime has been erased totally but all bad habits (smoking , alcohol , unhealthy food etc.) are strictly forbidden . Even profanity is charged . The so called ""police"" are not trained to deal with such a dangerous criminal . Not knowing what else to do they defrost Spartan with a parole in order to help them . So the chase begins . As I said the success is NOT the action . It is the futuristic imagery. I have read comments saying that basic ideas were stolen from other films . I don't know but if it was a rehash it was a good one. The brilliance of the script gives us everything : the harmonic society , the underground rebellants , the automatisation of domestic functions and car driving , the fines a person pays when says a bad word (one of the most amusing parts in the whole movie!!) even the way these people have sex and children . On top of that it has a slight reference to Orwell 's 1984. The art direction is simply PERFECT . All the gadgets , sets and costumes are totally convincing . The most excellent part is probably the computers . A perfect example of good script and direction . The words of the computers announcing the crimes and the research of the officers about the apprehension of Phoinix in the beginning are extremely witty , combined with the EXCELLENT graphics appearing on the screens . The result is magnificent. The opening sequence when Phoinix escapes is probably the most perfect in the film and one of the most classic ones in every sci-fi . Demolition Man is one of the most technically promoted films in history . The SFX are not used for impressive eye-candy but to SUPPORT A STORY . There is much violence in the film (guns , brutal murders) but fortunately the director managed to obtuse it to a slightly cartoonish approach. Sylvester Stallone and Sandra Bullock act very well . The supporting cast though is very underrated . Each one of them serves perfectly the movie. From Dr Cocteau and associate Bob to the chief police officer and underground leader Edgar Friendly . Even the cameos from Benjamin Bratt , Bill Combs , Rob Schneider as police officers are totally effecive and successful . But the best performance is definately Wesley Snipes as one of the most dangerously violent and psychotically diabolical villains ever seen in big screen ( forget Hannibal Lecter ) If you are a sci-fi fan stop reading and see it NOW .DEMOLITION MAN                                 9 /10",Demolition Man
146,captnemo,"Liberal policies come to full, horrific fruition w/spoilers",7,2 June 2001,"This is easily Stallone's best film. Well thought out, competently acted and a heck of a ride at that. By the year 2036, the liberals have finally gotten their way. Meat, harsh language, guns, action toys, sex, tobacco, loud noises, contact sports, caffeine, childbirth, body contact, spices, uneducational toys, chocolate, gasoline and anything else considered ""bad"" for you has been removed from the lives of the robotized democrats living on the surface. Below ground, we find the remnants of free-thinking, liberty-seeking, pro-living, excitement-loving, book-loving educated republicans scratching out any kind of life they can find. Dr. Cocteau, the ultimate liberal, seeks to further destroy civilization by creating even more programs to take more freedoms away from people. He seeks power for its own sake, and isn't interested in the people having any kind of free will. God forbid if someone should crave a hamburger. They would be re-educated to take away the harmful urge.Want proof?? Look at the scenes with Bob, the homosexual character. Cocteau and the other liberals tolerate him because of his skills, otherwise he would have been kept out of their sight. The Dennis Leary character, representing the underground conservatives, doesn't care a wit about what his personal life is, as long as he is willing to be of service. Leary is willing to let Bob be himself, whereas Cocteau would rather not even be in the same room with him. Watch Cocteau's face each time he looks at Bob. Contrast that with Leary, who merely thinks he needs a new wardrobe.This repressive future is well thought out by the 3 different writers. The actors pull off a difficult job of being the ultimate in political correctness. The year 2036 is as repugnant as can be. This film is a warning about the direction we are heading in. Let it also be a lesson on how to change before it's too late.",Demolition Man
147,Colonel Ted,An action film with a razor sharp satirical edge,8,3 February 2000,"I think that many of the voters and reviewers who have judged Demolition Man on IMDb, have somewhat missed the point. Demolition Man is not solely an action film, but also a blistering and funny satire on Political Correctness. Sly Stallone is cryogenically frozen in the 20th Century after botching a rescue attempt and is awakened in the year 2032, after arch-enemy Wesley Snipes escapes from his frozen prison. What follows are some highly impressive special effects and exciting action sequences but this is mainly an excellent satire on PC as Sly awakens to frighteningly bland Utopian future when under the rule of Nigel Hawthorne (another superb performance), everything from salt, to sex, to swearing is outlawed. There is even a President Schwarzenegger Memorial Library! And the name of Sandra Bullock's character, Lenina Huxley is a composite of a character in Brave New World (on which the city San Angles is clearly based) and the author's name, Aldous Huxley. Now THAT'S an in-joke! Snipes is nicely insane as baddie Simon Phoenix, Bullock works on the innocent charm (deemed by some as bad acting) that she perfected in Speed as Huxley, and even Sly manages to get a few laughs as John Spartan (which is more than he managed in his dismal 80s comedies). Denis Leary simply steals his scenes with essentially one of stand up routines on a film set. Visually, the film is similar Metropolis and perhaps Blade Runner, but that doesn't matter, because this is a cracking and witty satire that indulges in self-parody without compromising the action and makes you wonder, how dull the World would be if everything WAS perfect. An action movie with half a brain in its head. We need more like them.",Demolition Man

There's no crime and sex is done by virtual reality. There's no exchange of 'bodily fluids' -ick! Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), a criminal frozen in the 20th Century, escapes in the 21st Century and goes on a crime spree. John Sparten (Sylvester Stallone), a top cop also frozen in the 20th Century, is thawed out to catch him. Police Lt Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock) is assigned as John Spartans' Chaparone.Sandra Bullock as Lenina Huxley does a good job playing a polite eager lady of the 21st Century. She has an interest in the 20th Century so she's quicker to recognize violence than her cop peers, even doing a karate move, which she later explains comes from, ""watching a Jackie Chan movie"". She's playing a nice girl who carries a big stick I guess. Later in another movie, 'Miss Congeniality', Bullock would play a tough cop, undercover as a nice beauty contestant. Sandra Bullock carries this movie in a very amazing, very memorable performance. Bullock is this movie. This is a SF movie tho, where everything that is up is down, and where sometimes movie makers seem to comment on apparently taboo issues of the present. Bullock received only a 'Razzie' award for her role here.It turns out, the head honcho in the 21st Century, Dr Raymond Cocteau (Nigel Hawthorne), actually released Simon Pheonix on purpose - so he'd cause mayhem and give the government an excuse to further control peoples lives (which could seem strange considering there's no crime littering or violence already). One thing about the future is the same - behind the scenes there's a rich powerful bad guy who is really the cause of all evil.I was entertained by 'Demolition Man' and probably in love with Sandra Bullock, when, near the very end, I realized, 'hey, is this what is going on right now'?

156,Greekguy,Sly Steps Up,8,6 September 2012,"This is a guilty pleasure of mine, along with other films of this genre such as The Running Man (1987) and Escape From New York (1981). Each of these different films share a healthy distrust of authority and an examination of our cultural norms through the presentation of a dystopian society and the rebels that stand outside it. Of course, this film isn't Ingmar Bergman. It's an action flick, but it's full of intelligent material and imaginative metaphor. It's also an enjoyable ride, not unlike those westerns where a misfit rides in and handles something that the locals just can't. For me, this is the most affable characterization that Stallone has given. As John Spartan, a 20th century policeman frozen in a cryogenic prison and then thawed to pursue his nemesis Simon Phoenix (played by an effusive Wesley Snipes),Sly gives an understated and enjoyable performance as a violent ""fish out of water"". Snipes is very effective as the effervescent psychopath Phoenix, but Dennis Leary comes close to stealing the show with a ""more than just"" cameo role with one particularly funny monologue. Some critics have panned this film, and that's understandable. As I said, it's a guilty pleasure. But if you think of it as part Logan's Run (1976) and part Shane (1953), with a core that is critical of our current values and a hero that exemplifies the dangerous stranger, you might give it enough leeway to win you over. And if you have a hard time giving Stallone that much credit, please remember that Alan Ladd wasn't quite the Orson Welles of his generation. It's also important to remember that this film is more tongue-in-cheek than not, and that farce, too,is crucial to social commentary. In the end, action films like this work because they marry both our desire to be a hero in our society and to be a rebel against those social elements which aggravate us. They speak to the reluctant centurion in all of us.",Demolition Man
157,james_norman1981,A surprisingly good action film.,7,13 July 2006,"The title would appear to say it all... let alone the poster. STALLONE! SNIPES! DEMOLITION MAN! It sounds about as subtle and entertaining as a sledgehammer to the head... only this film is much more than just two big action stars slugging it out. Demolition Man, lord knows how, somehow pulls off the very difficult trick of bringing several styles together: action, comedy, thrills, spills and even some philosophical debate! Yet none of these aspects of the movie are too raw or overdone. What we get is two action stars, one just entering his prime while this remains one of the other's few recent films of any worth, engaged in a typical cop vs bad guy movie, but one that doesn't ignore everything else in favour of these two characters.Much of the credit for this lies with Sandra Bullock. Her friendly, ballsy prettiness, which is so often miscast as sexy female lead or hard nosed bitch, is perfect in this movie as the naive but spunky Lt Lenina Huxley, one of the few cops in modern day California with any desire to actually fight crime. Her fellow officers, all of whom seem brilliantly cast, regard her desire for action as almost offencive and openly say so, though in the future it seems that anything like a personnel character attack, such as mockery or sarcasm, have been ironed out. This is because, in Demolition Man, the future is a happy place (ish)! The story concerns Stallone's John Spartan, a fairly rogue cop who takes down bad guys left, right and centre but does so with so many deaths and explosions, not to mention buildings destroyed, that he inherits the nickname Demolition Man. Spartan is a real movie alpha male, ignoring orders and making his own rules yet always getting the job done. So far so typical. When downtown LA, which has become a riotous hellhole by 1997 (a future date for the movie's real world opening), Spartan goes in to take out Wesley Snipe's Simon Phoenix, a psychotic killer who has taken a tour bus full of people hostage. Spartan goes in and gets Phoenix only, somewhat inevitably, the building is destroyed... however the hostages were apparently still inside.Spartan is imprisoned in behavioural modifying cryogenic sleep (you're freezed and they change your brain's synaptic pathways while you're asleep) for 75 year, along with Phoenix, who goes in indefinitely (which suggests quite a high prison population given the hell that California was stuck in during the movie's opening!). However, prisoners still have occasional parole hearings. At one Phoenix escapes, having somehow learnt the verbal password to his cuffs along with numerous new skills and abilities. Quite how or why is unknown... He breaks out, killing numerous guards and the prison warden.This is hugely problematic for the new San Angeles police force (the location being what's left of California after the Great Quake of the early 21st century) as they haven't had to deal with a murder for over 20 years! Their comically inept reaction to the emergence of a killer like Phoenix in their Utopian society is where a lot of the film's humour comes from and the writers turn a one joke movie into a hysterical two hours, particularly when Spartan is unfrozen to catch Phoenix. Stallone's fish out of water routine is skilfully handled, not least the hilarious moment when he can no longer stop himself from knitting Lenina a sweater thanks to the behavioural modification of his mind! It's a great joke and is not alone, particularly some of Bullock's one liners such as, on Spartan's seemingly aggressive ribbing of an aged colleague, 'That's how insecure heterosexual males talked to each other in the 20th century.' Gags like this, as well as the general quality of the writing and the bedrock concept of this movie, make it really worth watching. Other than the three principle leads there is excellent support in Benjamin Bratt, Bill Cobbs, Bob Gunton, Dennis Leary and, perhaps most surprisingly, Nigel Hawthorne an English thespian who only took the role so that he'd be allowed the lead in the cinema version of the Madness of King George. Hawthorne, who sadly died in 2001, gives a brilliant turn as the seemingly benevolent mentor of San Angeles, delivering such lines as 'You are fined one-half credit for a sotto voce violation of the Verbal Morality Statute' with a grace and aplomb far in excess of what the movie must have read like, yet perfectly in keeping with the irreverent style.Sadly, the greatness of this movie doesn't last forever. The plot makes sense but falls apart slightly when Phoenix's hidden master is revealed and turns out to have absolutely no clue how dangerous the man he sprung from prison is. Similarly, when Phoenix starts thawing out his mates they don't paint the sky red like you'd expect their involvement being peripheral at best with some quite recognisable actors given little more than expendable henchman roles. The final fight is pretty off key as well and doesn't really do the tension Stallone and Snipes generate much justice, although it does involve some pretty nifty effects given the year this was made.However, all in all Demolition Man is something of a gem of an action movie, involving a clever premise intelligently handled and with some great lines delivered by actors who are on form. It doesn't dip much and is a very satisfying couple of hours, complete with all the prerequisites of a futuristic action movie (guns, explosions, love interest and so forth), with a lot more than I was expecting having just watched it again for the first time in years (such as great lines, good acting and excellent pacing). Overall I highly recommend this film, particularly if you've seen it before and only vaguely remember it as another so-so action film. It will surprise you... in a good way!",Demolition Man

People that are obsessed with the past, can't take a joke and are being sheltered their who lives. And yet, we have two figures from the past, one who feels like he doesn't belong in the new world because of so many restrictions that will rob people of their free-will and individuality for safety and security and with no way of defending themselves. The other, who was being given newer abilities to preserve the past filled with violence and anarchy, but is out-of- control that the handler, himself can not handle the situation anymore and easily became the victim of his own foul play. While I did enjoy watching Wesley Snipes' performance, I feel as though he's been taking notes from Caesar Romero's performance as the Joker from the 1960's Adam West Batman TV series.

159,crendine,Not So Serious Please !!,8,11 March 2015,"This has to be the most misunderstood movie in the entire career of Sylvester Stallone. Most likely due to the fact that his previous roles in Rocky, Rambo, Fist, and Nighthawks were just straightforward portrayals. However, in my opinion, this film is actually a tongue-in-cheek goof on futuristic action movies. If viewed in this light, I believe most viewers will really appreciate the merit and performances here. Sandra Bullock, (who always seems to play a cop), turns in an absolutely hysterical portrayal of an out-of-place, futuristic policewoman trying to act like a 20th century street cop and butchering all the associated street phrases. Wesley Snipes turns in (what I believe his only comedic role) an unbelievably over-the-top performance as a villain guided by a computer chip placed in his brain giving him unlimited abilities. The dialog here, if listened to closely, is hilarious and the action scenes are really top notch. Dennis Leary and Ben Pratt turn in very good supporting performances. Don't take this movie so seriously and I think it would be quite enjoyable. But, be sure to focus on the dialog. Highly recommended for a change in futuristic movies.",Demolition Man
160,PeterKurten911,Better setting than story,8,19 January 2006,"Sylvester Stallone has walked three paths most action stars attempt to thread, yet he did so with success : pure gun-blazing action, drama & comedy. Needless to say, the last two are blended in with the first. Drama was most prevalent in D-TOX, Comedy was the key word to STOP OR MY MUM WILL SHOOT!. Toutches of both can be found in DEMOLITION MAN. The culture clash between John Spartan and the San Angeles community of 2032 obviously provides the comic relief while his less outspoken moral judgment on the future counts as drama. As for the action, there's nothing like the Dirty Harry cop to make Sly kick ass ! Sandra Bullock's first major performance is questionable. She adequately embodies the 2032 citizen, which makes her downright annoying, but on the other hand it's not far from the silly-girl-next-door attitude we love her for in her later work. Her voice didn't have to be so artificially high-pitched, though. Wesley Snipes is over-the-top. Nowadays it feels like a waste to cast such a competent actor in your standard psycho role which is a small shoe to fill. The others are fine cardboards, only Associate Bob would've benefited from a third eye.The sad thing about this movie is that its premise & setting are more fun than the story.

the film is very funny,
and has a nice story.

was cursing around in this movie,

164,beerwine900,Great fun! i really enjoyed this movie.,7,16 August 2007,"The Demolition man aka. John Spartan (Stallone) is a L.A cop in 1996, Los Ageles has become a city full of criminals and is generally a really messed up place, the man who caused most of the chaos is Simon Pienex (Snipes) who is a pretty messed up person, something really bad happens due too Phoenix's doings and John Spartan ends up getting arrested for multiple man slaughter and is placed in cryo(frozen)prison along with Simon Phoenix who is apprehended and charged for all the crimes hes committed. years later in 2032 Phoenix is woken up for some reason and escapes from prison but unfortunately the world has become a loving caring place full of harmony where it is illegal to swear or eat junk food even to have sex is band due to the risk of H.I.V, the police have become sissies and they don't even carry guns, then the police come up with the idea that if they wake up John Spartan he can catch Phoenix and they can go back to saying things like ""be well"" and ""Greetings and salutations citizen what seems to be you're boggle"".The action starts straight away with Stallone going into a building beating the crap out of a bunch of people, the action was actually quite good Stallone and snipes had some good combo's, i like it in the beginning when Stallone runs up behind a guy punches him in the kidney then smacks him in the face with the side of his beretta. The gun fights weren't great because to many bullets were fired that only hit air although they were still entertaining.Stallone plays the part of John Spartan well, but the character of spartan isn't original a tall, its the usual no nonsense kick you're ass if you try anything type of character which is so common in action movies. Snipes was very enjoyable too watch, his character was very over the top and extremely crazy he also had a excellent laugh. Sandra Bullock plays Lalena Huxley a policewoman who is obsessed with the 20th century and obviously gets on well with Stallone, her performance was good.the script and story were good it was quite funny at times and had some great one liners.I give this movie 6 out of 10 for actionAnd 8 out of 10 for enjoyment",Demolition Man
165,weymo,see you at the Bell,8,11 August 2001,"Great movie. This is the type of movie that gets more fun to watch as time goes on, like ""The Time Machine"" that was released back in the fifties.  It lets you get an idea of ""what did they think the future would be like"" and see how close they are. One funny note is how close one thing is.  The Taco Bell.  No, Taco Bell has NOT become the only fast food franchise, as the movie foretells, nor is it the center of haute cuisine culture.  But the blue-purple and hot pink bell of today is certainly present in the movie in an era when the company still used Mexican green, yellow, and red.  Life imitating art?It's the sort of thing you wouldn't notice unless you'd seen the movie when it was released (like I did) and then see it later. [This same sort of thing shows up in Schwarzenegger's Total Recall...remember the girl putting EIGHT quarters in the Coke machine...remember how LUDICROUS that seemed when the movie came out?] Something that made me laugh over and over was the machines which ticket people for bad language by sounding an alarm and printing a ticket.

His ""Stop!-Or My Mom Will Shoot"" was a lame-brained comedy actioner with an amusing nightmare sequence, the rest of the movie was just a nightmare to watch. His buddy-cop actioner ""Tango&Cash"" had humour, but even less intelligence than the aforementioned movie. It also had Jack Palance turning in a truly awful performance as a baddie named Yves!Demolition Man is a delightfully tongue-in-cheek Joel Silver produced sci-fi/actioner (actor Craig Sheffer was EP) about a tough cop from 1998 who is released from cryogenic prison (he's been put to sleepy-bobo's for a while) in order to catch maniac Wesley Snipes, his old foe, because the futuristic police, and I quote ""are not trained to handle this sort of violence"". Derivative, but Snipes is brilliantly funny, Stallone is in good form, Sandra Bullock has her best role here, and the excellent supporting cast includes Rob Schneider, Denis Leary, Glenn Shadix (""Beetlejuice""), Benjamin Bratt, Jesse Ventura (wrestling), Nigel Hawthorne, Troy Evans (""Ace Ventura""), Bill Cobbs, and Bob Gunton (""The Public Eye"").

167,Johnnycitystar,An Action Classic,8,4 January 2008,"this film without a doubt, is a underrated classic. It's really one of my favorite action flick.from the memorable characters, to the great performances, to the great pacing, and the humor in the film to make this an enjoyable film.The film starts in 1996 officer John Spartan is on a hunt to catch criminal Simon Phoenix.Spartan evenutally catches him, but is arrested when police officers find out that hostages where in a burning building and John takes the blame for their deaths.John is sentenced to be frozen in prison for about 60 years for his crime.Now, 36 years have passed the world has changed from crimes to the environment and etc.Now, Simon Phoenix is having a parole hearing but evenutally frees himself and kills a couple of guards and a doctor.Phoenix also realizes that he has changed and wonders how.he is more stronger, more smarter, and more violent.realizing that the police don't stand a chance against him.they decided to realize John Spartan since he was the only person that ever stopped phoenix.Spartan is now back being a cop and fights phoenix in a museum where guns only exist.John finally discovers that phoenix was relased because to kill someone and john has no choice but stop phoenix despite the fact he is much stronger than him but he isn't alone since he has help from fellow officer Lt. Lenina Huxley.Overall, the one problem of this film is that the film is straight-forward and mediocre.really no plot holes in this film.From phoenix being realized to being stronger and it's obivious that john spartan is gonig to fight phoenix and defeat him in the end so really this film has really no surprises.as for character development, it's decent.John spartan is the overall, tough-guy ""I Don't give a damn"" personality.but he has sympathy for others. The scene where the scraps are stealing food from taco bell, he defends them for trying to eat and look for food from the others criticizing them.Simon phoenix is the overall bad-guy.A violent,rude,loud mouth person. but for some reason his character has feelings the scene where he kills Dr. Raymond Cocteau for losing his mind you somewhat cheer for him in the end. Lt. Lenina Huxley is a Dynamic hero. she is energetic and somewhat immature and enjoyable, and has also has a growing affection on John Spartan, making her a likable character.as for the acting It's solid. Sylvester Stallone gives an overall solid performance as John Spartan.he really fits in his role well in this film and it's also funny with his chemistry Lt. Lenina Huxley as he mostly complains of saying insults wrong. Wesley Snipes gives the most memorable performance in the film. it's obvious he enjoys playing the psychotic killer which make his performance enjoyable and really his character brings most of the humor in the film, with his over-the-top insults, and attitude.Sandra Bullock does give great performance as Lenina Huxley as she also enjoys playing her character and making her character likable with her chemistry as with Sylvester Stallone.Overall this film is enjoyable I suggest this film to anyone who hasn't seen it trust me it's great.",Demolition Man
168,JamesHunt18,Great Action Film with entertaining take on the future,7,22 July 2020,"Demotion Man is more your standard explosive action movie. Yes, the action is there, great to watch and gives you way more than your fix but the film is way funnier than I expected. This is largely due to the characters and how this future is imagined.I love the way the future is depicted in this film. It doesn't focus on what everyone expects for a future sci-fi like flying cars, and what not, but small details that no one would expect, most notably the ""franchise wars"". Brilliant!Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes are certainly great as ""maniacs"" as they go after one another and just fall into their roles. However, Huxley (Sandra Bullock) has got to me my favourite character and Sandra is brilliant in bringing her to life. She plays a cop in this future world, interested with the era Stallone and Snipes' characters belong to and listening to her try and fail at making references is a joy to watch. Sandra is the perfect actress here as her mannerisms just make and sell the role.Don't take this film too seriously and just let yourself enjoy it as I expect Brambilla and the writing crew intended. Can't believe it took me till 2020 to discover this. Can definitely see how this film has become a cult classic!",Demolition Man

And having seen Wesley Snipes in a variety of serious roles, it's wonderful to see him in the off- the-wall role he plays in this movie; we were constantly having to remind ourselves that that was, indeed, Wesley Snipes.So if anyone tells you this movie isn't any good, just tell them to ""shovel it!""(""Atlant G, Schmidt, you are fined one credit for use of a terrible joke in an IMDB comment."")",Demolition Man

Stallone and Snipes are well cast as the leads, and Snipes is great as the devious Simon Phoenix. His talents for action combine with a deft often overlooked comedic talent in a role he plays well. Sandra Bullock delivers a typically good performance in yet another naive heroine role, and the rest of the cast, from Benjamin Bratt through Jesse Ventura back up very nicely. The action is quite plentiful, the pyrotechnics are very impressive at times, and the sets as a whole are very appropriate.

The story was surprisingly interesting-- it portrays a dystopian future in which everything and everyone is sanitized to the point of ridiculousness. This future society serves as the foil to both the tough guy cop played by Stallone and the super criminal played by Snipes.This film is not for people who are easily irritated by an occasional lack of realism or the existence of mistakes/plot holes.

His ""nemesis"" Simon Phoenix is played (with sadistic fun) by Wesley Snipes. They both end up in the future (2036) to battle it out again.Stallone is obviously having fun playing this part and the same goes for Snipes. There are some hilarious parts in the movie. Maybe some social satire too? Also some great action, with a highlight in a nice car chase. Movie looks great too, set in the future with some ingenious gadgets/things.I only have one complaint: The movie has parts/jokes that are hard to understand for non-Americans.

185,AVass0812,"The proper title of this film should've been ""The Career Ender""",4,24 July 2002,"I was flipping through the cable channels the other night and what do you think was playing? Yep, that ""forgettable' science fiction film ""The Demolition Man"" starring none other than Sly Stallone. This film was bad from the very start. I remember paying my $5.00 (shows how long ago this was!)at the theatre to see this. Now Stallone was trying to reinvent himself with this film. I believe this was the first or second of his attempts in a field that he had no business. Stallone is the equivalant of Forest Gump in science fiction. First off the premise that criminals are not executed anymore, but permanently frozen to be rehibilitated later on in the future. And that Stallone's character (who is a cop) is also sent ""up the freezer"" for going after Simon Phoenix...(what a name). Anywho, he gets thawed and reprogrammed with the knack of knitting as his rehibilitation. What the? Come on. This movie lacked in everything. Story, character, plot, character, and most of all ACTING. Sad to say that this was Sandra Bullock's first rola and she had to play the leading lady to the ""Italian Stallion"". She must of have felt like Adrian Balboa in Rocky. Well this movie just was bad. Now its not entirely disappointing. I did like Wesley Snipe's character in the film. I like it when a leading star ""acts out of the box"". Snipes goes to unfamiliar territory playing a baddie that bites it in the end. Of course Snipes has since gone on to do bigger projects (aka Blade and Blade 2). Wouldn't that have been a hoot to see Stallone trying being the ""day walker""?? LOLAnyway, this film could've been so much better if it was done in the premise of an ""Escape from New York"" or the ""Road Warrior"". The special effects weren't bad, but just lacked elements.Its one of those films that should've been at television show first. Probably would've wound up on Fox or USA Networks.  Anyway, if there's nothing else on and you have insomnia, then watch it for a laugh. See how the over the hill Stallone pretends to still be a tough guy.

The dialogue is awful, makes little sense or logic, has zero in the way of originality and is just another ""bad guy escapes and hero needs to be brought in to save the day"" film.

It could also be a precursor for Wesley Snipes in Blade. The storyline is original and even though it doesn't make you think too much it still keeps you watching. One of the few really decent action movies that came out of the '90s (aside from the Van Damme & Schwartzeneger flicks) and I will never get tired of watching it. At this point I'm just waiting for the special edition to come out. Not only is Stallone still a bad ass, but Snipes is almost the perfect villain. The only thing that bothered me is the music selection for the future. Are we really going to only be able to listen to stupid commercials tunes in the future?

189,moviedoors,A delightfully successful action/comedy,8,11 December 2006,"Demolition Man was a childhood favorite of mine. In fact, I distinctly remember seeing this in the theater at 9 years old, my first theater going R-rated film experience. I loved it then, and like too few childhood favorites, I've just kept on loving it.I appreciate Demolition Man for different reasons now. As a child, I loved the action and it's still great today. The action of this film actually feels very fresh now as this was made before CG became the industry standard. I love CG as much as anybody, but I'll always have a soft spot for just plain old gritty stunt work and this film has top notch stunt work.One of the aspects that's continued to amuse me (and reveal itself to me as I've grown old enough to comprehend) is the humor and the sharp satirical edge. This is an action film that actually has a brain in its head and has something to say. The satirical element doesn't feel like a tacked on hanger for action scenes, and the two aesthetics are pretty affectively blended into one another such as in the museum scene.Despite some small nit picky elements (like the 1996 LA in the opening) this film does not feel dated at all. Its take on censorship and free will feels as relevant now as it did 13 years ago (honestly, that's not that long, of course). Popular music seems to be inching closer and closer to the 30 second commercial sound bites of this film's future.I'd say this is easily one of Stallone's best performances (though Rocky will probably always be his crowning achievement). Comedy is a tough and a frequently under appreciated acting talent and Stallone pulls it off here. He doesn't play it like he's in on the joke which makes it all the more effective. Snipes obviously had a blast as Simon Pheonix, chewing the scenery, and busting out some very impressive kung-fu. If there's a character who's in on the joke it's this one. Bullock is endearing in her awkward attempts at impressing Sparton with her shaky hold on action movie lingo.Demolition Man is a real comfort movie. I can put this film on any time, no matter what my mood is, and it puts a big smile on my face and sometimes, that's exactly what everyone needs from time to time.",Demolition Man

It is hard to swallow that the police in her society are so clueless and not really trained to deal with 'bad guys'. That said, I do enjoy how her character and Bratt's work with Stallone to stop Snipe's character, a true sociopath.A pet peeve (I live in the UK) is how they have changed the name from Taco Bell to Pizza Hut. The dubbing over of the name Taco Bell is poorly done and as far as I know, there is no reason given in the credits. That may seem silly to some, but Taco Bell is a common fast food restaurant in California.I love the scene where, driving in a cruiser with Bullock, Stallone's character learns of Schwarzenegger being elected as President.

194,Python504,Demolition Man (1993),6,10 October 2009,"For most of the 90s, Slyvestor Stallone's career was pretty much on free fall. After both ""Rocky V"" and ""Rambo III"" proved unsuccessful to both critics and audiences in '90, Stallone struggled to come up with another blockbuster, making carp like ""Judge Dredd"" and ""Daylight"" in the process. 1993 proved to be a semi-return to form thanks to small successes like Renny Harlin's ""Cliffhanger"" and ""Demolition Man,"" an entertaining if completely forgettable action flick. Co-starring Wesley Snipes (who was becoming a big box office draw thanks to hits like ""White Boys Can't Jump) and from producer Joel Silver, the film first starts off in a crime-laden 1997, where dedicated police officer John Spartan (Stallone) has just captured criminal Simon Phoenix (Snipes). Unfortunately, Spartan kills thirty hostages in the process, causing both of them to be convicted and rehabilitated via cryogenic freezing. Flash forward to the year 2032, where Phoenix has been freed and escapes to wreck havoc on a crime free ""San Angeles."" With no other options, the impotent police force (including Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt) unfreezes Spartan to apprehend the wild Phoenix.There's no doubt ""Demolition Man"" is filled with problems: the direction by Marco Brambilla (who was pretty much never seen or heard from after this) is workmanlike and pedestrian along with the numerous action scenes, the film's attempt at social commentary fails in the form of over-preachy monologues by the always loudmouth Dennis Leary, many subplots are left unresolved (including one involving Spartan's daughter which goes absolutely nowhere), and some hardcore film fans might cringe with the sight of small piece of comic relief played by none other than Rob Scheinder.That being said, the film does make up for its flaws, thanks to strong performances by Stallone and Snipe (both clearly seem to be enjoying themselves), a fun screenplay co-written by ""Heathers"" scribe Daniel Walters is loaded with cute little gags and quirks, and there's enough entertainment value to make up for most of the films faults.Overall, the film is a harmless piece of fun.

Us men would watch this movie just to see Sandra Bullock in those skintight pants! However, she steals the show with her funny mispronounced slang of her past. She is at her best in this movie.Stallone and Snipes are great as adversaries as well as Dennis Leary as the fast-talking Rebel.

I just love movies that try to predict the future, ussually by the time the future date approaches in reality, its just way off.  When this movie predicts 1996 LA at the start of this movie, its like a post apocalyptic nightmare (only three years later after the production date of the movie, yet again made after the LA riots).  Then, even worse, the picture of the future 30 years from now.  We all can share what Stallone's character is feeling when he is unfrozen in the future, just completely out of place.  Although his time was a nightmare, the future, even in its tranquillity, is also a nightmare, a place were almost everything is limited making it just haunting.  This movie's depiction of the future is also very hilarious and all in all just fun.  Seeing Stallone being frustrated with everyone and with everything is very amusing.  Demolition Man is a very solid movie with great entertainment value. 7.5/10.",Demolition Man

Set in 2032, a dangerous villain (Snipes) and a dangerous cop (Stallone) were frozen in a Cryo Prison over 30 years ago and are released in what is a version of Orson Wells 'a brave new world' where Los Angeles and San Francisco unite to form one super state similar to the future set in Minority Report with eye scanners and a digitally controlled world where swearing, violence, feelings and even salt are all illegal.Great entertainment, great action, great script, 10 out of 10.The script is well written with future language quite polite compared to our modern world.

Demolition Man is one of the best action films I've seen in my life because it has a great balance of satire like Robocop and a good amount of action. Another thing is the characters which are likable and cool, even the bad guy was very fun, who is played by Wesley Snipes. Then we get to Stallone who does a really great job and gives a serious, but funny performance as the main character, highly recommend this movie.One more thing, don't listen to Siskel and Ebert's review.

204,ErikPedersen1,Cheesy Dumb Fun,6,5 March 2019,"Mellow greetings citizen,Demolition Man is a 1993 film about police officer John Spartan, played by Sylvester Stallone, pursuing criminal psychopath Simon Phoenix, played by Wesley Snipes. Due to events at the beginning of the film, they are both cryogenically frozen and suspended until 2032. While at a parole hearing, Phoenix kills his captors and escapes into the outside city of future Los Angeles, which has seemingly transformed into a completely peaceful utopia. Due to the future world's police being unable to handle violent crime, Spartan is released with the task of apprehending Phoenix. However, Spartan quickly discovers that the future world is controlled to an excessive degree with many previously normal things either illegal or greatly frowned upon such as: physical contact, chocolate, gasoline, caffeine, meat, swearing, most music, and anything spicy. This is, though, where the majority of the entertainment value this film has comes from. It's entertaining to see Stallone's character try to complete his mission while at the same time learning, with often great frustration, about the sterilized world of the future. The film succeeds more often than not largely due to the setting, which is very much a satire and criticism of society in 1993, but still works today.The acting is fine for the most part. Stallone in particular carries the film in that respect, and Snipes is suitably over the top. Meanwhile the supporting cast is reasonably entertaining: Bob Gunton, perhaps most well-known now for his role in The Shawshank Redemption, plays the very bald police chief; a very young Sandra Bullock plays Lenina Huxley and serves as Stallone's sidekick for most of the film; Nigel Hawthorne plays Dr. Cocteau, the not-entirely-benevolent overseer of future Los Angeles. The writing for these characters is entertainingly cheesy, whether it be one liners from Stallone, the strange phrases from the future populace, or the half-remembered sayings occasionally spoken by Bullock's character.Visually, the set pieces are decent and look futuristic enough with an abundance of grey chrome-like metal for interior shots and structures along with immaculately-maintained green vistas when outside. The special effects are convincing when used (such as the freezing scenes) and the huge amount of CRT screens and graphics give everything a futuristic but also a very distinct 90s appearance. The costume design is also visually interesting: Snipes' character looks bizarre but unique in an orange shirt and overalls (and never wears anything else); the police force meanwhile look extremely militaristic in their dark grey uniforms; and the rest of the population dress in pseudo-religious gowns, particularly Hawthorne's character.Other than that, the camerawork, lighting, editing, and music are completely unremarkable but serviceable - they get the job done. The action scenes are also sufficiently well-directed though there is not any particularly mind-blowing or impressive choreography.Final thoughts: Demolition Man is at its strongest not when Stallone and Snipes are fighting it out, but when they are apart and simply interacting with the future world and its people. Thankfully, there is quite a lot of that in this film and as a result it is pretty entertaining at times. It is far from great and has its shortcomings, but it is overall decent and worth a watch if you desire some 90s cheese.Be well.",Demolition Man
205,peterseaby,Witty Sci-Fi Actioner,9,22 June 2007,"This movie comes close to having everything I want in an action flick. Great fight sequences - the museum is a standout - are only the beginning. The chemistry between Stallone and Snipes makes every interplay between the two characters a mix of humour and excitement. But, fifteen years after release, it is the futuristic elements of this movie that make it a standout. The outlawing of dangerous or unhealthy activities, the fines meted out for swearing (""you have been fined 5 credits for a sotto voce violation of the verbal morality code...""), the relentless pushing of the peace and tranquility message - many of these jokes have cleverly anticipated trends which are taking place in today's society. Every time I read about a government banning trans-fats, all I can think about is John Spartan chowing down on his ""hamburger"" with such relish. Whether by accident or design, this movie portrayed many future trends with eerie prescience. Can the Schwartzeneggar Presidential Library be far behind?",Demolition Man

I'm a fan of many Stallone films but this one was a huge disappointment. A star like Stallone can't afford to be doing such low grade films. Admitedly, he did come back in subsequent years with films such as 'Copland'.I guess the let down for me was the way in which this fantasy of the future held back. A film set in a future which is based around tedium is, itself, going to be quite dull. Sandra Bullock is slightly irritating as the over-eager futuristic cop. Wesley Snipes does well as the bad guy. He's about the most entertaining thing in the film.The problem with the film is the premise. Cryogenically freezing criminals doesn't seem like much of a solution to me.

209,enosshenk,Why the hate?,9,6 June 2009,"Im not sure at all why people hate on this movie. In my opinion, it bridges a gap between mindless action movie and satire, and the result is pure gold.Im not going to write this like a review ""Stallone plays John Spartan etc"" because you KNOW that. Id rather comment on the movie as it was made.This movie halfway pokes fun at a 1984 style future, and halfway takes it seriously. And most movies that try to split things down the middle fail on both fronts, well as I see it this one pulls it right off and makes it great. The laughs in the movie don't come from ""ha-ha"" gags, but rather from biting satire and eerily prescient predictions. Tracking chips, omniprescent surveillance, making cigarettes illegal? Maybe we aren't there yet, but its been heading that way for a long time. It takes a lot to make an audience laugh at a ridiculous setup, then right after the laugh make them think ""Wait...That could easily happen!""The thing that I appreciate most about this movie is the fact that it doesn't forget its own gags. Most other movies, the first time a character was fined for the ""Verbal morality statute"", the movie would drop the gag, skipping the alarm tone and accusing voice. In this movie, every time someone swears in public within voice distance of whatever it is that ""hears"" them swear, in the background you hear the gag played out. This transforms it from a joke to a ""Holy crap, that would suck"" type of mindset, and it works!And thats what I mean. This movie more than most others that I could name merges satire and a dystopian look with lighthearted gags and ""mindless"" action scenes. Thats hard to do, and more people should give the writers and director and crew credit for sewing it together and making it play.One of the few action movies that I watch every time I catch it playing on my TV box, it works that well, and the gags still make you laugh. After all, absurdity is a very real way to highlight and satirize elements of society. It sticks with you longer that way.",Demolition Man
210,gawlinskie,one of three views of the future,7,11 June 2006,"Soylent Green (1973), The Handmaid's Tale (1990), and Demolition Man (1993) are three movies about roughly the same future timeframe, the first third of the twenty-first century. Together they give a rather discouraging view of the future, but each is a good portrayal of what might happen if a current trend is carried to an extreme. In 2022 (Soylent), Charlton Heston is a New York City police detective (Thorn). New York is now populated by 40 million people, food is scarce and so is space. In this society, women are part of the rented furniture. Corruption is rampant. Natasha Richardson (Handmaid) is a young women capable of bearing children. This is very rare in Gilead (the United States of the future). Only 1% of the women of Gilead can bear children. Kate is sentenced to become a Handmaid whose function is to bear a child for the infertile wife of a powerful leader (The Commander). This is based on a Bible story (Genesis 29:3135; 30:124). This is a society controlled by fear and repression. It does not have the overpopulation and resulting scarcity found in Soylent but is not an encouraging view of the future. Sylvestor Stalone (Demolition) is detective Spartan who was cryogenically frozen in 1996 and then thawed in 2032. The world into which he finds himself is discouraging in its lack of freedom and extreme social control. Foul language, meat, smoking, anything stimulating has been outlawed. Sex is accomplished through the exchange of mental sexual energy rather than exchanging messy body fluids. The degradation of women seen in Sylent and Handmaid is not found in this sterile vision of the future. Sandra Bullock's character (Huxley) is no less free than her male co-workers. This society does not have the lawless corruption and scarcity found in Soylent or the fear and repression found in Handmaid. However, it is sterile and stagnant. These three views of what the future might be are each well done and together make an enjoyable movie marathon unless you find these three views of the future too depressing.",Demolition Man
211,leubner85,Well Aged,8,26 June 2017,"Sylvester Stallone, as a cop who inadvertently kills 30 people during a showdown (accidents will happen), and Wesley Snipes, as a high-spirited psychovillain, are placed in the California CryoPenitentiary, frozen for several decades, then thawed out in the year 2032. The joke is that society has become so systematized and pleasure-denying that it's now a world of wimps. The police, trained to capture criminals with computerized gadgets, have no direct experience of physical violence. Sexual contact is illegal, as are alcohol and caffeine, and when you utter a four-letter word in public, a buzzer goes off and a prissy British voice informs you that you're to be fined one credit for violating the ""verbal morality code."" (Ice cream, I believe, is still allowed.)The movie, of course, is goofing on the puritan chic of the '90s, the new righteousness with which people are divorcing themselves from their bad habits and incorrect thoughts. But then there's Stallone, the big, beefy avatar of red-meat values. He's a winning comedian in this movie, rolling his eyes at a world that no longer places any value on testosterone. Stallone gets some lite chemistry going with Sandra Bullock, as a cop who's such a product of the post-aggressive future that she speaks like an android. As the baddie, Snipes, hair dyed the color of an upset stomach, gives a performance of operatic schlockiness, laughing in the face ofeverything.Demolition Man is as much a piece of cheese as the grade-B sci-fi movies of the '50s, which also satirized, with a kind of touching literal- mindedness, the brainy emasculation of the future. The main difference is that those films didn't climax with 45 minutes of smashing mayhem. A Joel Silver action movie released during the fall is a bit of an oxymoron anyway, but even if it's the promise of overwrought violence that lures people into theaters, I suspect it will be the quieter scenes —the ones with a pretense of wit—that keep them satisfied.",Demolition Man

With an all-star line up of Sly Stallone, Sandra Bullock, Wesley Snipes, Dennis Leary and Nigel Hawthorne, how could you go wrong? They even had a large million-dollar marketing campaign tie-in with Taco Bell.
Unfortunate it flopped and flopped hard at the box office after taking a beating from the movie critics. They said the script was horrible and unrealistic, the acting was bad considering the cast, and it was yet another boring shoot-em-up.So what is it like 10 years later? A little too close for comfort if you ask me! As I stated in the title this movie was way ahead of its time. Who would have known that in less than a decade politics, science and technology would have skyrocketed us into the 21st century. While we don't yet have ray guns and cars that drive themselves, we do have frozen Hall of Famers, personal communication devices that permeate our lives, and the beginning of a government looking to use it all to sterilize and sanitize the way we work, play, live and love.Granted the script was pretty custom written. The Taco Bell tie-in is just pretty blatant and obvious. Dennis Leary's character was mainly based around his hit parody song ""I'm an A**hole"" and his comedy tour. Sandra Bullock's chracter's love of contraband 20th century items just happened to all be products from 20th Century Fox, the film studio for this project. Still, this is an action flick! The whole point of the film is for the stars to blow stuff up! If critics don't like a film for what it was written for, why bother to review it at all?This was probably the most quotable movie of the year as well, mainly based from the blatant misquotes by Bullock's chracter.

The wimpy future society represents a ridiculous yet funny extrapolation of the current trends in political correctness, safety at any cost, and commercialism. Everything that's bad for you is illegal. People are ticketed and fined for cursing. No one touches each other. All restaurants are Taco Bell (although I understand it's Pizza Hut in Europe). There are a lot of great lines, many of which are on the quotes page. Bullock is great as a naive and overeager cop, and even Stallone is funny with his wry comments. I give it a solid 8.",Demolition Man
235,willfairfield-15632,Great movie. Prophetic.,10,3 June 2019,Great movie except for the how many times can we dub in the advert Pizza Hut.Back in the 90s I didnt realize this movie would become true. But it has.Free speech is dead. Even in this review I cannot violate the veral morality statutes.,Demolition Man
236,truthcomeslast,Not where the action is,8,20 October 2006,"One of the commentators here said about the movie: ""nobody likes it, apparently"". Right. But they're wrong. This movie has been sold as an action movie and it has actors famous for action and little else besides. Yet action is not the point here, for the film is a bitter-sweet ironical farce about our coming destiny in the world of consumism; seen thus, the action is accidental to the movie. Just remember the scene about the car radio that exclusively plays 15-second music clips from commercials! Well, we've got almost that far. To sum up: What a strange and extraordinary Stallone movie!! Rambo meets Big Brother, and there's a lot to laugh ... and to reflect afterwards. As a consequence, this is the only Stallone movie I have in my DVD collection. And this says something.",Demolition Man
237,soldat_2000,interesting and funny,8,12 January 2009,"Well this movie..is quite good....not the best but sure good....the casting is great...Stallone, Snipes and a hot chick Sandra Bulock!!! There is a lot of action ...and also funny things...!! The most funnier moment is certainly when Stallone didn't have toilet paper and started to say bad things and automated machine gone crazy with alarming and ejecting the tickets and when he and Sandra wanted to have sex and she brought sex machine and Stallone was so confused...!!! Special effects are solid !!! Snipes is good as a bad guy but i more liked when he is Blade...but hey...!!:)...Stallone in this film is hard guy but very funny..!!! I highly recommend that you see this movie...it is very funny and have action which is important for this type of movie.!!",Demolition Man

239,johnandrews22,This movie is a classic,10,2 February 2015,"One of my all time favorites. A film from the awesome era when action sci-fi movies didn't take themselves too seriously. DM has an overall light hearted feel, and doesn't waste too much time on the science aspect of sci-fi. Give the audience what they want, future guns and a mega ripped Sly Stallone coming out of a hyperbolic chamber. This movie has such an awesome vision of the ""future"", that I think we should actually start modeling our society after it. Our children's children can one day live in a world without murder death kills, or toilet paper. A world where mega hot Sandra-Bullock-like women are the cops. In particular, I'd like to see the profanity ticket system from this movie implemented into society immediately. Cussing these days is at an all time high, and I just feel like every human being could learn a lot from this fun futuristic throwback. I give this movie a perfect 3 out of 3 seashells. A must see!",Demolition Man
240,msc1296,One Line Made this a 9 Star Review,9,12 October 2019,"This movies is overall fantastic. I would Highly recommend watching the film. The only problem in the film that I have is a line that Wesley Snipes's character, Simon Phoenix, says while he is in the museum. During the point while Simon is gathering weapons from the museum, he id taking supplies from a Viet Nam war mannequin.Simon says the line ""Excuse me Rambo, I'm gonna need to borrow this"". Given that Snipes's co-star in the film is Sylvester Stallone, this line confirms the existence of Rambo in the 20t century in Demolition man Universe. Sylvester Stallone plays role of John Rambo in the Rambo film series, but also plays the role of John Spartan in this film. Does this mean that the Rambo film series was a documentary in their universe, and John Rambo is John Spartan? Does it mean that John Spartan started as an actor, and then became a hardened cop in LA after filming the first three Rambo movies? Or could it mean that only the book First Blood existed, which is the first mention of Rambo? Simon Phoenix does not seem much of the reading type, so this seems equally as unlikely an option as the others.It is likely that this line is just paying homage to to Stallone's past works, but it still begs some questions. Overall Demonlition Man is an incredible film, and I would argue Wesley Snipes' best performance (including the Blade trilogy). I would highly recommend watching this film.",Demolition Man
241,tim-bishop-90,Funny & Original,8,2 August 2015,"Well now. I just saw this movie for the first time, after a good friend talked me into it. And I don't regret a second, let me tell you why: First, it's a great reference to Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"", where humans are conditioned (no swearing, no emotions, sex is just a habit, etc.) and humanity is violent free, yet uninspired. One of the main characters is also called ""Huxley"", which in my opinion is a clear honor to the author.Second, Snipes and Stallone do a great job fighting, as well as punching a few of the funniest lines ever about the new world of 2032. Just the idea of Stallone trying to find his way through this conditioned world where cars are electric, Pizza Hut is a noble restaurant chain and one gets billed for swearing is in itself already quite original.Third, some of the predicted facts in the movie have now come true, or partly true, which makes this older production seem even more interesting as time goes by. Definitely worth a good look, there's more to the eye than one would expect.",Demolition Man
242,jjpiccio,Predictions of the future,7,5 August 2016,"The prediction of the year 2030 looks like the director was right. Four years away from 2020 and the streets appear safer. People seem less menacing than the year 1993 and the generation ten years from now is predicted to be feminine and peaceful. Feminism isn't new, it's the vision of many feminists,the views have not changed that much since 1993.The second assumption was technological advances which will always be true. I would not be surprised if we don't have forms of AI now in our computers, but the most challenging prediction was the social context of 2030. People will be sissys. It already is.",Demolition Man

245,cyberpunkmgtow,A Glance into the not so distant future,7,4 December 2017,"This movie is like a satire of current events, but it's getting very close to being a reality as our current society gets more offended at everything. And with the help of things like social media people can get offended by something that happens on the other side of the world, so that's not helping either. Anyway still a very fun movie.",Demolition Man
246,Crusader-2,hopefully not meant serious,4,21 October 1998,"If Stallone used this film to cartoon his former show-up-and-destroy-everything-films it's not too bad. If this movie was meant to be serious, it is ridiculous.",Demolition Man
247,FiReWaLL,The change?!,7,30 September 2004,"This film is fantastic! It is a mild film, that any teenager could see, but it still has a lot of action and a lot of fun. Sandra Bulloc stars really cute in the beginning of the career while Stallone on the apice of his! Wesley Snipes, works good as the bad guy here.There are some interesting details in the film: ""The Schwarzenegger Library"" is mentioned, because the actor in question became President of the US. This film is from 1993, but now, right now, who's California's governor? Exactly 10 years later, and also in the state where the film happened to be (San Andreas)??! Funny coincidences...But the film didn't predict all the future:Quite interesting was to see this film with a new DVD, and to realize that the voices of the actors (I could read their lips) and all the pictures of the film were changed form TACO BELL to PIZZA HUT!!! Why that?! :D",Demolition Man
248,v.pheasey,One Of Sly Stallones best action films ever!,9,6 November 2000,Sly Stallone has really put alot of effort into this sci-fi action romp. I think the opening sequence to the film is dead cool where sly stallone does a bugee jump from the helicopter and bursts into the building and shoots the bad guys. Totally cool I actually found out that Sly Stallone did all his own stunts in the film (thats why I like the film that much.) If you are a really big Sly Stallone fan then you will lap this film up. I am not a big Sly Stallone fan myself but I am into action films and thats why I like this film so much!,Demolition Man

But my problem with the movie is that it didn't explore enough on the characters & I found the new laws in the future such as swearing, sports & sex being illegal is be most ridicules thing I have ever seen.

251,imdb-20658,Hands down the best worst movie I have ever seen,10,7 August 2009,"This movie is the pinnacle of delicious awfulness. It is so incredibly bad and the futuristicness of it all seems backdated even for 1993. The embarrassing references to Brave New World are, well, just that, embarrassing. I mean, Lenina Huxley? Really? (Great book, by the way, read it if you haven't) But in all its horribleness, I love it to pieces. I shriek like the little girl I once was when it's on TV and I pop in the DVD fairly frequently. I love to bask in the glory that is this horribly ridiculous film. The acting, clothing, sets, storyline.. I guess the word that comes closest is endearing. I hope my future kids will manage to enchant me so with their shitty school plays and pitiful attempts at poetry.Well done, everybody who worked on this film. I love you : )",Demolition Man

253,ss_rockman,A glimpse into the Future,10,22 December 2019,"The people who made this movie must have had a crystal ball, but it is depressingly accurate as to the direction we are headed in.

The films details are elegantly smart, as well as the overall thought. The film is against a cold yuppie society. The film cares for the weaks and therefore has a good moral. The film is against corrupt administrations and elegantly anarchistic. The film says that there are circumstances when violence is the right thing to use. The film is one of the best earthly science fiction films. It reminds of the film Brazil, one of the best like Dune and Alien. It is nice as a comedy but expencely realistic - and romantic!",Demolition Man
255,Tha_Man,When action films were good (Possible SPOILER),8,20 July 2004,"Demolition Man remains one of my favourite films. During my teenage years any film with big explosions, martial arts and funny one-liners was regarded as 'excellent'. This film I'm glad to say, has passed the test of time. In an era where we're seeing the demise of the big action blockbuster, Demolition Man remains fresh.**SPOILERS** The society portrayed in the movie is one of peace, paranoia and exclusivity. Enter Wesley Snipe's character... a loud-mouthed villain with no conscience, equipped with a short-fuse, exceptional martial arts skills and some of the funniest lines in action-film history. The only man capable of stopping him, is the very same man who jailed him years ago. Sylvester Stallones character is a quiet loner who seeks to bring down villains any which way he can, usually with no thought for public safety. In seeking to bring the other one down, these two characters spend most of the film tearing the 'perfect' society apart. As the story is based in the future, our minds are open to the fact that parts of this film could still possibly occur. This, along with Snipes and Stallones' chemistry and the usual action film cameos (love interest, the respective gangs and unfortunate passers' by) keeps us gripped right to the very climax.Overall this is one of the most enjoyable action films I've seen. You leave feeling satisfied that not only did you get what it said on the tin, but knowing you'll look forward to seeing it again in the future.",Demolition Man

The film is set between 1996 and 2032, not a long time, yet whenever guns, cars, or police procedures are mentioned all the characters (who are +30yo) act like they dont know what that is WHILE THEY OBVIOUSLY WHERE ALIVE DURING THE 90S WHEN THESE THINGS EXISTED IN THE MOVIE ITSELF, SO IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE. And i can't believe no one is mentioning this in their reviews, like this alone is a major inconsistency not a thing to look over.Another point, this has to be the worst depiction of the future: it's like they didn't even try with their ugly costumes. It's so lazy.",Demolition Man
258,davidfancella,The Stallone movie ever,10,27 June 2005,"I thought it was one of the greatest movies of all time. As a social commentary, it's extraordinarily on-target. I mean, come on, this is the movie where the joke was made that Schwarzenegger would be president and Taco Bell would win the franchise wars, and what do you know? Now people want the constitution amended so Arnold can run for president and Taco Bell is winning the franchise wars (they merged with Pizza Hut and KFC).The story parallels Brave New World and there are numerous references to it. It's the best ""Big Brother"" film to ever be made. It's got great laughs, great action, and just great stuff. The basic plot is pretty mediocre when you get right down to it, but when you factor in all the detail and the very well-thought script, it's a must-see movie. It's like the anti-movie, it's great, but nobody likes it, apparently.",Demolition Man
259,timbarra_jlv,DVD difference,9,15 September 2005,"On the DVD it has the Taco Bell scenes listed as Pizza Hut - the voice overs - everything!. It looks particularly strange when they are talking: and the mouths are saying Taco Bell but;. The voice overs are ""Pizza Hut"". They altered the signs as well on the restaurant as well as the bottle of food that the underground guy drops when he gets in that fight with Sly! What a dumb amendment! But what a good movie for a laugh with the action element as well! Wesley Snipes fulfills his role exceptionally well. Sandra Bullock and her quirky statements: licked his ass!

Having re-watched it last night (again on a rental) my view of the movie has increased. In between the two watchings i've read numerous new world books including Brave New World, 1984 and the excellent We by Zamyatin. It shows the film in a new light and elevates what was previously a fun good action movie/comedy to something more. Oh and if you care, Vladimir Zamyatin's ""We"" was the precursor to George Orwell's 1984. A fact acknowledged by Orwell himself. It's a stunning read and the English translation appears to be exceptional (I can't read Russian sadly).",Demolition Man
