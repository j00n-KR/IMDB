0,TheLittleSongbird,"There are many adjectives to describe Fantastic Four- unfortunately ""fantastic"" isn't one of them",2,11 June 2016,"Despite being somebody who enjoys superhero films as much as the next person, this 'Fantastic Four' reboot has to be down there with one of the worst.The 2005 film and its sequel, both directed by Tim Story, were not great films (the former was somewhat mediocre, though the sequel was an improvement) but even with their faults they were much better than the reboot. Although it is often considered one of the worst superhero/comic book films ever made, this reviewer has yet to properly see the 1990s incarnation, but it does have to be irredeemably bad to be worse than this.Oddly enough, 'Fantastic Four' is not completely irredeemable. Michael B. Jordan is a cool, commanding and likable Johnny/Torch, and the only one in the cast who tries and succeeds to do something with the way the characters are written. It is ironic that the best thing about the film was the thing that was attracting the most negative publicity before release due to his race. Some of the film does look quite good, with slick photography, darkly atmospheric lighting and audacious production design.Not all of it comes off though. The editing is both sloppy and choppy, not only looking cheap but in particular severely affecting the storytelling. The special effects are at best perfunctory and some of them look pretty bad actually, much prefer the look of The Thing in the Tim Story-directed films here The Thing looks too much like a rock monster. Josh Trank clearly wasn't the right director for this, directing with little flair or involvement with the story. Then again he doesn't deserve all of the blame as most of the film's failures falls at the door of producer/studio interference. The music has some haunting parts but at best generic and not much stands out.'Fantastic Four' has only one good performance, the rest are poor. Miles Teller and especially Kate Mara make Ioan Gruffodd and Jessica Alba look like Oscar-winners, Teller looks far too wooden and out of his depth as a leader and Mara is incredibly mechanical. Jamie Bell does try to stay true to Ben/The Thing's character, but the character is written far too one-dimensionally so Bell despite some glimpses as a whole fails to inject much tragedy or depth to him. The chemistry between them is almost non-existent and they just don't feel like a team. Toby Kebbell is an insipid and very non-threatening Victor Von Doom, here a villain practically shoe-horned into the story and basically a villain for the sake of being a villain with no obvious motivation or personality to speak of.In all fairness they do have a very clunky and by-the-numbers script, with some cheesy lines and too many stupid moments, to work with that has some neat ideas but barely does anything with them. There is too little action, and what there is of it is hugely underwhelming, very uninterestingly choreographed and no fun or tension, everything just feels indifferent. The biggest let down here in 'Fantastic Four' is the story which is a mess. Scenes that go on for too long, due to poorly written exposition that is barely elaborated upon (the father-son relationship could have injected some much needed heart to the film but goes nowhere), drag endlessly, and when something does happen if not by much the film rushes through it with some incompleteness here and there. The too short running time is to blame, the film should have been twenty minutes to half-an-hour longer.Particularly suffering is the far too busy third act and a very rushed (in length and to a lesser extent pace) and dramatically limp final battle, which doesn't really feel like much of a battle.All in all, fantastic is the last word to describe a very disappointing reboot. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Fantastic Four
1,Leofwine_draca,Quite pitiful,3,27 March 2018,"I read somewhere that this version of FANTASTIC FOUR - coming hot on the heels of the two instalments from the 2000s - was only made so that 20th Century Fox could keep the rights to the franchise. Whatever the reason for its existence, this turns out to be a real dud of a movie, a movie by turns dull and deeply embarrassing. A fresh new cast of actors take up the main roles, and three of them are very good, but not so here. Kate Mara has so little to do that she seems bored by it all, while Jamie Bell has even less screen time. Toby Kebbell is a fine actor (just watch DEAD MAN'S SHOES if you don't believe me) but wasted as another stock bad guy. This long-winded origin story goes on and on and on with boring experiments in a laboratory for nearly all of the running time, until the last half an hour which packs in the over the top CGI effects and explosions. It's mindless, childish, and the complete opposite of what Marvel are managing to do with their Avengers franchise at the moment.",Fantastic Four
2,SnoopyStyle,very flat and unsatisfying,4,7 May 2016,"It's 2007 Oyster Bay, NY. 5th graders Reed Richards and Ben Grimm become friends. Reed is building a ""Biomatter Shuttle"". Ben's family owns the local junk yard. Nobody believes in the boys. Seven years later, Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) have a working prototype in the high school science fair. The teacher dismisses them but they catch the attention of Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter Sue Storm (Kate Mara). Reed joins them at the Baxter Foundation to build a bigger version of his machine. Bitter former child protégé Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and reckless speedster Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) also joins the team. When Dr. Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) calls in NASA, Reed, Johnny, and Victor decide to recklessly be first on the new world. Reed calls in his best friend Ben. The expedition goes badly. Victor is lost on planet Zero. The three others escape. They and Sue gain superpowers.It starts well. I'm not going complain about any departures from the comics. That's not a big deal for most people. The movie starts with a fine friendship between Reed and Ben. Then it quickly splits them up. It's a giant mistake. It has an easy fix but nobody seems to care about the group chemistry. Almost everybody is acting flat. Reed is on the autistic spectrum but there is no such excuse for everybody else. None of them are charismatic or given a chance to be compelling. Kate Mara and Michael B. Jordan could do so much better than this.It becomes simply going from one point in the plot to the next. There is no excitement. The dialog is bland. It could have worked as a moody body horror but it's obvious that somebody desperately wants an action packed thriller. The bare minimal requirement for this movie is to introduce a group of young actors with personality and compelling connections. These are great young actors but the movie wastes their talents. The problem is that this achieves nothing, at least nothing good.",Fantastic Four
3,Horst_In_Translation,Not that bad really,6,19 November 2015,"""Fantastic Four"" is one of the biggest new superhero movies of 2015 and the characters and their abilities made me pretty curious about wanting to watch this one. The director is Josh Trank, still a fairly young filmmaker, but his work on ""Chronicle"" and ""The Kill Point"" was appreciated. Unfortunately, his effort here was not. ""Fantastic Four"" is generally considered a flop and a disappointment. I would not call it that, however. I quite enjoyed the first hour of the movie, the way the scientists received their super powers. Still I wish, they would not have jumped ahead a year in time when we see them stuck in the lab. They possibly could have elaborated convincingly on how the quartet actually learns to properly use their powers, but this was completely left out.There were other story flaws early on too, for example that there was no security to make sure nobody uses the machine or the 3 protagonists' (plus Victor) idea to go on the journey themselves. Nobody of them was properly trained for that. They were all scientists and only theoretically, in terms of knowledge, possibly ready for such a journey, but never physically. Also Jordan's character seemed like he had absolutely no connection or interest when it came to his father's work. It felt pretty random that he was part of the team suddenly. Needless to say the struggling father-son relationship was not elaborated on properly. I did not like the Victor Von Doom parts after his transformation. He was much more interesting before it. They probably thought it would be bad to make a movie without a real enemy, but if they include one they should have elaborated better on him (for example the Sue Storm connection). It was basically 15-20 minutes of special effects and fighting with little substance to it in terms of the whole story. This is quite a shame as Von Doom is somewhat considered the most memorable antagonist in the Fantastic Four universe. He was truly wasted here for the most part. Still I can forgive them for it as, even if this film has flaws, it was an enjoyable watch for the most part.Nonetheless, I felt that almost everybody in here had no chance to show us their talent in terms of range. They all gave great performances in previous films, but they don't have the material to come close to these. I am especially referring to Miles Teller in ""Whiplash"" here of course. It's definitely easier for him to play unlikeable characters and he is absolutely not supposed to be that here being actually the leader of the quartet. This is a fairly short film for superhero movie standards. 100 minutes really isn't that much, especially as 7 of these minutes are credits. I am generally not a big fan of Constantin Films and by general perception it seems as if they messed up as usual with this one. Still, I cannot say I agree with the very negative reviews. It's an okay superhero movie, decent watch if you like the genre like myself, but if not, then you probably better skip this one. Overall, I give it a thumbs-up and I will probably also watch a sequel if they decide to make one. And check out the older films what I've been planning to do for a while anyway as I quite like Alba, Chiklis and McMahon. I hope that one did a better job when it came to depicting the 4 as an epitome of teamwork.",Fantastic Four
4,Prismark10,The frivolous 4,4,25 October 2015,"There was a fun element in the 2005 rather cheesy version of the Fantastic Four film that is very much missing in this reboot. In fact there is very little chemistry between the foursome in this film.Given the underwhelming reception of The Amazing Spiderman reboot I would have thought Fox would had learnt some lessons as to how to relaunch a Marvel franchise.Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is a rising young scientist who discovers he can transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. He is recruited by Professor Storm and teamed up with other scientists that includes his adopted daughter Sue Storm (Kate Mara) his troubled son, Johnny Storm (Michael B Jordan) and maverick Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell.)Once they finish the teleporter, the team decide they want to be first for inter-dimensional travel before the military send their own team and Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to join them.Once they get to the other world they follow a power source that takes Von Doom and in their attempt to get back to earth an incident causes their physical form to change and gives them superpowers which the military learns to use. However Von Doom returns and wants to destroy the planet.The film had a lot of post production issues and director Josh Trank distanced himself from the final cut from the film. Apparently Trank wanted to make a superhero film with no action sequences!The film had to be rewritten and reshoots done to give the film some action scenes. It is still a drab, inert film where very little happens and there is no fun between any of the characters. The film just feels like one long set up for the obligatory sequels which is now questionable after the poor box office of this film.The film actually looks cheap as well with many studio bound footage, its like watching a television show when you see scene after scene inside a lab or even worse in corridors. The special effects are relatively poor, maybe because after the reshoots they were rushing against time to complete the film for release.The final showdown with Von Doom was pure nonsense and all over too quickly. Then again I could not wait for the film to finish as it wastes its young cast.",Fantastic Four
5,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining Adventure,6,22 May 2016,"The nerd teenager Reed Richards (Miles Teller) has been researching teleport since he was a kid, helped by his best friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell). During a high-school scientific fair, he is invited by Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) to join his research team in his institute in New York. Reed teams up with Dr. Storm's son and daughter Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) and Susan ""Sue"" Storm (Kate Mara) and the outcast Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and they succeed to send a monkey to another dimension. Soon they learn that the institute has an agreement with NASA to send astronauts to the other universe. However they decide to go by themselves to be the first humans to reach the place. However there is an accident and they are all affected by the power in the planet. Further, they achieve super-powers, but Victor is left behind. What will happen to the researchers? ""Fantastic Four"" is an entertaining adventure with a story that explains the origins of the abilities of the four heroes. The film is underrated at least for those that are not fans of the cartoons. There are many points that are not well explained, specially the relationship of Reed and Ben with their families, but works OK with decent special effects and acting. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Quarteto Fantástico"" (""Fantastic Four"")",Fantastic Four
6,nogodnomasters,starsCOME A LONG WAY SINCE THE GARAGE,5,30 October 2018,"In this version of the Fantastic 4, our foursome or five-some are created when they transport to an inter-dimensional planet called ""Earth Zero."" This film re-introduces the characters with all the action crammed into the final 10 minutes of a 100 minute film. Like the Ryan Reynolds ""Green Lantern"" this film was simply intended to introduce the characters before creating an action packed sequel. Judging from the box office and reviews, that aspect is less probable than Rick Perry be able to name all the cabinet posts, even though it is in production and scheduled to come out in 2017.I like the fact they changed how the group was formed, creating a transporter to another world with an infinite stream of odd super villains. If you like alternative beginnings, check out ""Justice League, Gods and Monsters."" I don't know what happened to Jessica Alba, apparently she got old and fat and had to be replaced by Kate Mara. None of the four I consider as good as the last group. Miles Teller needed to carry the film. He worked out well as a geek, but not so well as a super hero. The dialogue needed more humor. The writers failed to create dialogue and killed the film.Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some PG-13 swearing.",Fantastic Four
7,kosmasp,It's not that it's really bad - it's just lame,3,19 October 2015,"Although in comparison to what Marvel puts on screen (when they do their own stuff, because FF is also a Marvel comic obviously), this is a real ""stinker"" if you'll excuse my french. Also there was no conspiracy to ""kill"" this movie. The negative buzz is self owned and can easily be explained by watching the movie.While it doesn't start off that bad, it just continues on a pace that really feels like a drag. If Raimis Spiderman felt wrong, then boy does this feel even more wrong. It takes about an hour to actually start and despite some decent CGI (though human torch still is not perfect, if you get distracted by that), it never takes off ... no pun intended.I like the actors, which made it even worse watching them fight ... through the lines of dialog and the snail pace of the movie itself. A battle they couldn't possibly win. So please Marvel and whoever is responsible for this: buy the rights back and make it good again ... in comparison to this, the other two Fantastic Four movies look like great movies",Fantastic Four
8,classicsoncall,"""We opened the door, we're gonna close it.""",8,6 February 2016,"I don't come to these films as a Marvel Comic fan per se so for me it's simply entertainment. I do like to keep my eye out for comic legend Stan Lee for his cameo appearances but I didn't catch him here nor does his name appear in the uncredited cast list, so for me that was a minus. Same thing for the after credits sneak preview, there wasn't any so that's strike two. Otherwise though, I thought the picture delivered for what it was, a reboot of the Fantastic Four franchise that apparently has miffed a lot of the fans on this board judging by the negative reviews. I recall as a kid being upset when movies didn't maintain continuity with their characters, I'll use the Bowery Boys as an example. Today I watch those flicks and take them as stand alone pictures instead of nit-picking the film makers for changing the names of the characters or rehashing similar story lines. If I ever read the Fantastic Four origin story I've certainly forgotten it, so the way it was presented here seemed acceptable enough. If I have to come up with a negative, I guess it would be the ease with which the team took out Doctor Doom for the finale. In fact, he probably had a hand in his own demise by tampering with black hole science. But it's not anything I'm going to get worked up about.",Fantastic Four
9,jboothmillard,Fantastic Four,4,25 October 2015,"It was only ten years before the release of this that Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans (now Captain America) were the famous Marvel superheroes, but they decided to reboot them with a much darker twist, from Razzie winning director John Trank (Chronicle). Basically Reed Richards (Whiplash's Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Billy Elliot's Jamie Bell) have worked together on a prototype teleporter, at a science fair it attracts the attention of the director of government-sponsored research institute Baxter Foundation, Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey). Reed is recruited to join Storm's children, scientist Sue Storm (127 Hours' Kate Mara) and somewhat reckless technician Johnny Storm (Chronicle's Michael B. Jordan) to complete a ""Quantum Gate"", designed by protégé Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell). The experiment is successful and the gate can transport into a parallel dimension known as ""Planet Zero"", facility supervisor Dr. Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) plans to send NASA scientists through to venture, but Reed, Johnny, Ben and Victor embark on an unsanctioned journey using the Quantum Gate to Planet Zero. On the world filled with otherworldly substances Victor causes the surface to collapse and an eruption, Victor is left behind as the landscapes breaks up, the others make it back to the shuttle, but as Sue helps to bring them back the machine explodes, the bodies of Reed, Johnny, Ben and Sue are altered on a molecular-genetic level. They have gained super-human conditions and abilities beyond their control; Reed can stretch like rubber, Sue can become invisible and generate energy forces fields, Johnny can engulf his body in flames and fly, and Ben has become a bigger rock-like creature, ""The Thing"", with enhanced strength and durability. While Reed blames himself and escapes the facility, to find a cure, the others are held in confinement for study and experimentation on their conditions and abilities, it is a year later that Reed is found as a fugitive and returned. Equipped with specialised suits designed to keep up with the abilities of them, for stabilisation, control and containment, the deal Dr. Allen makes with him is if he opens another portal to Planet Zero, he will help find a cure for their conditions. Arriving in the parallel universe the explorers are shocked to discover that Victor is alive, he has also gained abilities, the power to control the elements and telekinetic abilities, he now dubs himself as ""Doom"" and has become vengeful, deluded and evil as he wants to destroy the Earth and recreate Planet Zero, he starts his rampage killing Dr. Allen and Professor Storm. While in the realm he has built a structure to consume the landscape of Earth, he activates it from Planet Zero, but the reunited team of Reed, Ben, Johnny and Sue confront the antagonist in a destructive battle, Doom is eventually disintegrated in his own machine and the portal is closed. In the end the four Reed, Ben, Johnny and Sue returned to Earth are rewarded for their heroics with a new base for operations by the U.S. military, they decide to use their powers to help people and adopt the name the ""Fantastic Four"". Also starring Mary Rachel Dudley as Mrs. Richards, Chet Hanks as Jimmy Grimm, Mary-Pat Green as Mrs. Grimm and Dan Castellaneta as Mr. Kenny. The four stars cast as the first family of Marvel are reasonably suited, and you cannot deny that the special effects to bring their superpowers and all explosive sequences to life are fantastic, but the biggest problem is that it is full clichés and predictability, the story is silly, there are only three of four main locations in total and it is just generally underwhelming, the previous 2005 version is only slightly better than this disappointing only relatively entertaining fantasy action adventure. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture (tied with Fifty Shades of Grey) and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Screen Combo for Teller, Jordan, Mara and Bell (All Four ""Fantastics"") and Worst Screenplay. Okay!",Fantastic Four
10,ma-cortes,Average retelling with the phenomenal and sensational superheroes taking on Doctor Doom,5,16 November 2018,"A decade after the original film ¨Fantastic Four¨ (2005) with Ioan Gruffud , Jessica Alba , Kerry Washington , Julian MacMahon , directed by Tim Story was released, this film was rebooted because Jessica Alba decided not to do another ""Fantastic Four"" film and Chris Evans had moved on to play another Marvel comic book hero Captain America . Fantastic Four (2015), which starred Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Susan Storm, Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm and Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, was a darker recounting of the ""Fantastic Four"" story and failed at the box office . It deals with four young outsiders join an investigation team at New York to carry out an experimental space voyage . Soon they learn that the research facility has a covenant with NASA to transport astronauts to the other universo . However , they decide to go by themselves , to be the first humans to reach the strange place . Then the youngsters teleport to an alternate world and a dangerous universe ; but things go awry, it alters their physical form in shocking ways. Further, they achieve super-powers, but Victor/Doctor Doom is left behind . Four people are forever changed and the four must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. Reed Richards , inventor and leader of the group gains the ability to stretch his body and takes the name Mr. Fantastic . Sue Storm, gains the ability to turn invisible and create force fields becoming The Invisible Girl . Her brother, Johnny Storm, becomes The Human Torch with the ability to control fire, including covering his own body with flame , as Johnny morphing into a ball of flames . And Reed's friend , Ben Grimm , is turned into the super-strong , super-tough Thing . Together they become a team of super-heroes and use their unique powers to foil the evil plans of villains .The incredible quartet taking on the threats to the world with their extraordinary force .Change is coming.When you change the world, prepare to defend it. Beyond darkness... beyond fear... lies the fantastic... However there is an accident and they are all affected by the power in the planet.
The spectacular and bizarre adventures of Marvel comics group's greatest super-heroes team .The movie blends thrills , noisy action , comic book , spectacular feats , overwhelming special effects and it results to be pretty entertaining but mediocre , including a silly and ridiculous plot .This is a free adaptation from famous comic book by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee , taking parts here and there . The screenplay is pure entertainment but far from Marvel canon , containing some absurd and embarrassing scenes . The plot is well known , plain and simple , it begins with an experimental space journey financed by a strange N.Y. Research Institute . But the starship arrives in another world and things get worse , and they find themselves turning into fantastic Super-heroes .The Fantastic Four become into team of Super-heroes and use their supernatural powers to battle the nasty enemy, Doctor Doom .The picture is regularly realized with state-of-art FX , impressive production values and so-so casting formed by agreeable young main actors . And for the first time , The Thing/Jamie Bell was created in computer-generated rather than going through make-up or prosthetics . Amazing array of technical special effects with rousing action set pieces illuminate the full-blown feats carried out by the Fantastic four . The final duel between the protagonists and villain super-hero Doctor Doom is breathtaking and moving . Many comic-book fans disliked the way Doctor Doom was portrayed , but original series author Stan Lee, agreed with them , though here Stan Lee declined to make his usual cameo . It has been reported that 20th Century Fox interfered with the film, to the point in which Josh Trank's original movie layout was changed drastically , as some set pieces don't make sense , that's why one of the most major changes was the cutting out of 3 whole action scenes . Several moments in the movie take their visual cue from Jack Kirby's work in the very first ""Fantastic Four"" comic book . Although have given bad reviews to this film , I think that is amusing with spectacular scenes during whole the movie . The motion picture was middlingly directed by Josh Trank (Chronicle , The Kill point series) . It was really panned by critics , that's why after the disappointing reviews, Josh Trank went on to tweet that he'll ""never be working on a comic book movie again"". Trank finalized his version of the film in 2014, the studio was dissatisfied and didn't like the director's work, demanded re-shoots, which were done in early 2015.
Other films about ¨Fantastic four¨ are the following ones : 1994 ¨Fantastic four¨ by Olley Sassone with Alex Hyde White , Jay Underwood , Rebecca Staab , Michael Smith , and ¨Fantastic Four¨ 2004 by Tim Story , this is the best version dealing with the spaceflight crew who suffer Gamma ray attacks in the Van Allen belt , being formed by team leader scientific named Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) , the pilot named Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) , Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) , his brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and included Victor Doom . As Mr. Fantastastic, leader of the group gains the ability to stretch his body to any shape ; Sue Storm achieves the skill to become invisible girl and projects telekinetic fields ; Johnny Storm as the human torch creates a flying blazing ball and with power to control the fire . It is followed by the sequel titled ¨Rise of the Silver Surfer ¨, with the same players and Doug Jones as Silver Surfer .",Fantastic Four
11,paul_haakonsen,Every bit as mediocre as it was an unnecessary reboot...,5,22 July 2021,"I remember skipping on this movie when it came out back in 2015, because I essentially didn't care an ounce about ""Fantastic Four"" or superheroes in general. But sure, I would watch the movies when presented with an opportunity to do so.And it wasn't before 2021 that I had the opportunity to sit down and watch the 2015 reboot of an already mediocre superhero quartet. And writers Jeremy Slater, Simon Kinberg and Josh Trank just didn't really manage to win the lottery here with this movie. Essentially then the 2015 reboot titled ""Fantastic Four"" was every bit as unnecessary and pointless as I had initially anticipated it would be back in 2015.The movie felt wholeheartedly unnecessary. Sure, it was watchable, and definitely had some nice CGI effects, this being a Marvel movie after all. But wow, this movie was not a great addition to the franchise.Sure, aspects of the storyline were interesting, but the movie was rather mundane and slow-paced. So not enough contents were in the storyline to make it a wholesome movie.And I just don't understand that whole political correctness tsunami that has been pounding through Hollywood for many years already. It just made absolutely no sense to turn the Johnny Storm character into a black character. It just doesn't prove accurate to the comic books.The acting in ""Fantastic Four"" was adequate, though nothing outstanding really. People here were putting on fair enough performances, given the limitations of the script and the lack of character development. I have to say that all of the characters portrayed in this 2015 reboot feel like one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs.A movie like director Josh Trank's ""Fantastic Four"" is a movie that you watch for the special effects and visuals. Yeah, I said it. And I stand by that, because the storyline here is vague and one that I will have forgotten completely come tomorrow.Ultimately then ""Fantastic Four"" was generic and mediocre, just as I had expected it to be. So it is with a clear conscience that I am rating this 2015 reboot a bland five out of ten stars.",Fantastic Four
12,Quinoa1984,a fiasco of mostly bland proportions (until the final 15 minutes),4,22 January 2016,"First off, you know you screwed up when Stan Lee - who started off his iconic streak of creating characters for Marvel by revamping the Human Torch with three others into the 'First Family' - declines a cameo.I have to wonder how the director Josh Trank sold 20th Century Fox on the concept of a deathly serious take on the dopey science fiction take on the Fantastic Four (Reed Richards ""Mr. Fantastic"", Sue Storm ""The Invisible Woman"", Johnny Storm (you know who) and Ben Grimm ""The Thing""). Perhaps it was at the time when they were once again looking at the competition - Nolan's Batman movies and his produced Man of Steel - and thought if the dark-dramatic cinematic approach could be taken with those, so too with the story of four scientists (and good old Dr. Victor Von Doom) who get affected by Gamma Rays and get their own powers. And maybe some day in the 21st century - if by some miracle it comes up again - another filmmaker can try his hands on a 'serious' Fantastic Four movie. Sadly, Trank's effort (as well as Simon Kinberg's and Fox's) makes it a nigh impossible thing to attempt much less accomplish.A thing to remember is that, unlike Batman, F4 is not really a serious series; even when things might get more serious or dangerous as in some of the Bendis/Millar Ultimate F4 comics, it's with the tone of it being kind of light. To try and adapt Cronenberg's The Fly and Scanners into a world where a character like Victor Von Doom IS a character with that name just doesn't work. How can it, unless it becomes some weird subversive joke (which this isn't)? There's perhaps one or two minor moments of levity (thanks Michael B. Jordan, one of the only actors trying here by the way despite the not-really-controversial change of color), but otherwise it has the tone of something that is as serious as the 1985 film Come and See (look it up) but is still under the banner of Fox's bland production side of things. In short, Trank screwed up his approach here, and also had a big miscast with Toby Kebbel as Victor Von Doom. Even typing that name with association to this is cringe-inducing.A big disappointment comes with the villain since, if nothing else, a compelling villain could have made things a little greater (as the convention goes, a hero is only as strong as his/her villain). But Victor Von Doom in the first act is a) only vaguely drawn as to be misanthropic and (sort of) with a crush on Sue Storm, thus some competition there from Richards, and b) he disappears for most of the film and returns looking like a rejected design from the early 90's Power Rangers show. He looks absolutely ludicrous and yet does things that should be cool in a darker context (the scanner power comes with making heads explode). But it's just silly and his plan doesn't make sense nor, especially most of all, how the Fantastic Four finally face him on the other-dimension ""Zero"" planet where they have the final (routine but hilarious) battle.But a bigger one is just, on a fundamental level, getting us to care about these characters, and that also comes from motivation issues for characters to do things: ego drives them to go on to the device that takes them to the Zero planet; Ben Grimm isn't really part of the group, is very tangential, and only comes on due to a late night phone call; the plot jumps ahead after the heroes get their powers a FULL YEAR, thus losing any growth or discovery, which is at least helpful if not essential in an origin story; there is no real 'central question' posed at the start that gets answered by the end. Reed Richards makes an invention, it gets spotted at a high school science fair (?) and that's it, off and away we go. Everything is grim, no pun intended, but I never felt the stakes or drama actually kick in, which is a major problem with the movie. And as much as Trank tries to add the atmosphere of a brooding science fiction tome, the acting from (usually solid and interesting) Miles Teller and Kate Mara is bland and not compelling.In short, watch for interest in knowing how it came out due to the production horrors behind the scenes (allegedly on the front of the director, surely from the studio once they saw what was there), and maybe get some laughs at the finale. Otherwise, beware.",Fantastic Four

Reid will have limbs that can stretch, Johnny will be able to turn his body into a flaming inferno at will, Reid's neighbor buddy, Ben (Jamie Noble), who he invited to join him in a trip in the teleport machine once it is successfully able to do what it was built for--inter-dimensional travel--is transformed into a giant rock monster (rocks and the source of the ""zero planet"" that can chance the bodies of humans on it enter the teleportation pod he is in, with Ben unable to close the door). Susan can cloak herself in invisibility and use a type of forcefield as protection or weapon if need be. Victor travels to the other planet, decides he'd like to see up close it energy source, eventually being carried into it, with his protection suit melding into his body as it is provided powers that can implode folks by merely willing it.I get why this film is so poorly received. It is so much origin story (and not even exciting origin story) and not a lot of ""superhero teams fights villainous heavy"". It builds and builds to an unsatisfying and rather lackluster conclusion due to how little we get of Dr. Doom. Doom in the comics is a badass villain. He causes the heroes a lot of trouble. In this film, he's some sad sack genius in love with Susan, with no charisma or grandiosity. When he returns from the other planet, he does some cool damage to a bunch of military and scientists, making them all explode from the inside like a scanner or causes their skin to roast before returning to his ""new home"", addressing his disdain for the government by enforcing a type of black hole device to suck Earth through a portal created by the teleport device. It's much too late by the time this happens, and really causes very little carnage overall to the people of Earth or destruction besides a giant crater in one wilderness spot. The ""joining forces"" of the 4 against doom, realizing that separately they are not capable but as a unit they can, culminates in a lot of CGI on a dark, rocky planet. This whole battle is like maybe ten minutes. This is a film truncated from a much larger film we haven't seen yet. Fox needs to put out Trank's film if just to allow us to see for ourselves if his version is better. It can't be much worse than this dour, ever so serious (where's the fun???) super hero movie without the superhero action fans are expecting to see. The cast might can be salvaged if they are given a much better film. Doom should have been a surefire winner as a villain if cast correctly and given more to do than rest easy on another planet. Instead we spend a majority of the film with scientists designing the damned transport (what is this, The Fly?) and getting used to their abilities. I think this origin story mentality is killing reboots. The Amazing Spiderman is such an example. I don't know where the Fantastic Four franchise goes from here, but it is in dire need of a changing of hands to another studio. This was a damned good comic book and is worthy of the right kind of treatment. Even the ""other planet"" looks like something out of Star Trek 3.",Fantastic Four

Michael B. Jordan is in a class of his own as ""Johnny Storm"" (admittedly, the best character from this rather limited choice) but the remainder of the team deliver a performance totally devoid of humour - there is simply no fun to be had in this dark, dreary telling of the four youngsters who are involved in an accident on a parallel world that leaves them with some rather interesting quirks. Soon everyone is trying to cash in on their skills - from science to the military - until their erstwhile colleague ""Victor von Doom"" (Toby Kebbell) arrives determined to seek his revenge for them leaving him behind... The effects are great, colourful and professional but that's about the height of it - Miles Teller and Kate Mara have no chemistry at all and Jamie Bell's appearances aren't long enough before he turns to stone to merit much comment either. Maybe the 2025 version will be better...",Fantastic Four
17,utgard14,A misfire on every level,3,10 November 2015,"Extremely disappointing reboot of the Fantastic Four. The special effects are poor, the characters are badly mishandled, and the story is a mess. There was no need to retell the origin story just ten years after another Fantastic Four movie told it. We're fortysomething minutes into the movie before they get their powers and then, when they do have them, they never do anything impressive with them. Not to mention they overcomplicated the whole origin and repeated the first movie's mistake of shoehorning Dr. Doom into things (more on him in a moment). Poor Sue Storm gets screwed over royally here. First, they robbed her of her rightful place as one of the four (she gets her powers just by being in the lab when the other four return with the cosmic energy or whatever). Second, she's portrayed as this frigid and colorless robot. None of the characterizations were right but hers was probably the most insulting. Reed doesn't fare much better. We're told constantly of his intellect but you sure wouldn't know it from the way he speaks or acts throughout this thing. Miles Teller is just awful and hopefully will never lead a movie again. Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan leave no impression, despite playing the two members of the group with the biggest personalities. Finally we come to Dr. Doom. I could not stand what was done to Doom in the prior Fantastic Four movies. Little did I know it could actually get worse. Doom is wrong in every way. He's some whiny hipster douche who, like the movie's version of Reed, we have to be told how smart he is because it never comes through in the performance. When I first saw him in his powered form I was ready to quit the movie. Here Doom looks absolutely ridiculous, like something out of a crappy horror movie. Doom is one of the most iconic Marvel villains. I do not understand what is so damn hard about getting him right in the movies. They always insist upon changing his personality, his origin, his look, his everything. Whatever this thing is in this movie, it is no Dr. Doom that I recognize.Director Josh Trank, in an effort to stop this movie's failure from hurting his budding career, is putting all the blame on 20th Century Fox. Because people liked his previous movie Chronicle and because people hate corporations, a lot of folks are buying his excuses. Frankly I'm not among them. Unlike some, I was not enjoying the first hour of this movie. I did not think it was a great way to go for an FF movie and I cannot imagine where Trank could have gone in the second half that would have made it work. Everything is dour and bleak and depressing. Here's a clue for anyone looking to tackle the Fantastic Four: if you don't think this concept is fun, you don't need to be doing this movie. This was not a happy experience in the least. Save the emo stuff and the lack of color for movies about Batman.The best part of the movie was when the gum-chewing guy got killed. He's one of the most annoying characters in recent movie history. If I had to endure one more scene of his smug, irritating face while he chewed that gum I would have screamed. As I said before, the origin story was overcomplicated (and unnecessary). The ""heroes"" are all unlikable assholes. The movie lacks any real point and does everything it can to steer itself away from what the Fantastic Four should be about, namely exploring the unknown and the wonder and adventure that comes with that. Thankfully this thing bombed and we are hopefully spared any sequels. If another FF movie is ever made, I hope it's by someone who gets the characters and the concept because I do believe an FF movie done right could be truly amazing.",Fantastic Four

""",6,19 August 2015,""" . . . there is only Doom,"" says one of the main characters (Victor Von Doom or something) in this rather lame Marvel Comics adaptation. No top financiers in their right minds would Doom their project by putting someone named ""Doom"" or ""Stupid"" or ""Idiot"" in a top position. The Detroit Tigers tried it by tapping a guy named DUMB-Owski, quickly setting the all-time American League record for losses in a season (119). It got so bad, Tiger center fielders would just THROW THEIR GLOVES in the direction of extra base hits whizzing by them in the grass. As Detroit reaches its franchise record for years without a World Series title, Dumbowski was fired one week--and picked up the next by the Boston Red Sox (who no doubt will go from their most-titled decade ever to another century without a crown)! As if a doomed lead character is not enough, this not-so-FANTASTIC-FOUR has some THING that looks like the runt of the litter if the HULK and GROT (from that raccoon flick) somehow could have kids.

19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,At the very end? More or less,7,7 August 2015,"Four 20-something brilliant outsiders design and construct a working teleporter and use it to visit an alternate and dangerous universe, altering their physical form in shocking ways and leaves them with superpowers. They must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy.This is a well-crafted film. Rating it a 1, as a third of all voters have so far, suggests you saw nothing of value in it, and, to me, is merely an emotionally charged overreaction. Don't get me wrong. This has weaknesses. It's *all* origin. You barely get to see the trailer-promised flight, fire-ball throwing, clobberin'(don't get me started on the explanation given in this for that catchphrase...), elasticity, invisibility or forcefield creation and manipulation. Even less of them using it for anything other than getting better at them. And heroics? Less than I thought possible. The climactic fight is when they do turn on someone other than each other, and it's over faster than you can compare it to that of an Iron Man flick. As far as comic adaptations go, this is also, by far, in a *long* time, the slowest, least funny and heaviest - one joke about how frequent speeches in this are doesn't change the fact that, yeah, there are a ton, the promotional material wasn't overselling that.Casting, acting and characterization are great. They look, sound and, most importantly, help define, their written and drawn counterparts. Well, Doom's face is boring – why ditch the mask? Don't even pretend it ain't awesome. Still, The Thing(Bell, capturing the inherent tragedy) genuinely looks like someone covered the poor guy in glue and broke large rocks over his entire body. The claimed inspiration of The Fly and Scanners is easily seen here: it's emotionally devastating to see the 4 with their bodies broken, as they unconsciously attempt to heal, only to further hurt and harm themselves. Granted, this would be more effective if they had started out less quiet, reserved and, as this whole thing is, gloomy, so they had further to go in that direction once they get these disabilities.There is some PG-13 violence and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to the bigger fans of the source material and format. 7/10",Fantastic Four

Thanks to a misguided attempt to go one step beyond to prove their work actually works the foursome are corrupted by forces beyond their realm of understanding and give them super powers and somewhat fantastic identities.

Correcting that mistake with a remake has not been the answer (ala Incredible Hulk, Amazing Spider Man and Fantastic Four 2015). They should do with the failed solo acts what they did with the Hulk and make them part of a collaborative effort.When Hulk came out I was devastated because he is one of--if not my favorite--comic book character. His two solo movies were atrocious. Then they put him on a team and all was right with the world. No, Hulk couldn't carry a movie by himself but he could certainly be a strong team member. Maybe FF can't carry movies by themselves but maybe they would be excellent in a team member role (like helping the avengers). That's the only future I see for them.",Fantastic Four

The experiment goes wrong, imbuing Reed, Johnny, Sue, and Reed's childhood friend Ben, with strange powers, and stranding Victor in the other dimension.The Fantastic Four get another origin movie, this one based on the alternative Ultimates version. It has come in for some rough press, but it is not actually a bad film. Which is not to say it's wonderful, because it isn't. But it's OK.The cast are fine, although I'm far from convinced about the casting of Johnny and Franklin Storm for no other reason, it seems, than Because Black. This Victor von Doom is still not the Dr Doom as best known in the comics, but is vastly preferable to Julian McMahon's hopelessly inappropriate version from the two earlier films.I have two main criticisms – one, the tone is all wrong. This film forgets to be fun. This Reed is a much lighter version, yet the film has no real fun with him, and Johnny, who should be the lightest character of all, isn't.

24,Wuchakk,Interesting ideas ruined by flat presentation,4,3 April 2016,"Released in 2015, ""Fantastic Four"" (or ""Fant4stic"") tells the story of Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm who acquire super-powers when their experiment to teleport to another dimension goes awry. Reed (Miles Teller) turns into a human rubber band, Sue acquires invisibility and relevant powers, Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) becomes a Human Torch and Ben (Jamie Bell) morphs into a huge rock man Thing. Toby Kebbell plays Victor Von Doom while Reg E. Cathey plays Dr. Storm.This is a reboot of the series after the mediocre ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" (2007), which definitely had enough good in it to make it worth watching. With this 2015 version, the writers drew from all the Fantastic Four comics, particularly the Ultimate Fantastic Four and the current crop. The main difference is that the team apprehends their powers via a trip to another dimension rather than from cosmic rays from outer space. Another difference is that Johnny Storm and his father are black and Sue was adopted into the family. I don't mind these changes because the idea of transporting to another dimension is more interesting than traveling to the moon; and, since it would be nigh impossible to beat Chris Evan's performance as Johnny in the 2005 version, replacing him with a black dude sorta makes sense, not to mention it gives the film wider appeal. Still, morphing Johnny into a black dude smacks of political correctness and is a turn off. Would they turn Luke Cage, Black Panther, Storm or Cloak into white people? Of course not; it would be outrageous. Speaking of the 2005 movie, I thought it was a good film version of the superhero family, but it fumbled the ball with Dr. Doom and the action-climax could've been better. So how's this newer version compare? Well, it's darker and more serious, which is fine since the more serious the better for me. Unfortunately, the movie has a flat tone from beginning to end and, with the exception of Reed Richards, the characters are a bore. Both Johnny and Ben are distant and lack any defining moments. They're boring, lifeless characters; barely more than names in the script. Furthermore, the naked Thing is dumb; I was surprised we didn't see his rocky Mr. Johnson hanging out. Sue fares better and I prefer Kate Mara to Jessica Alba since she has the intellectual flare necessary for the role. As for Doom, he's more scary and powerful than the character in the 2005 and 2007 films, but he deviates too far from the comic version. He's basically a malevolent version of ""Lucy"" (2014). Lastly, the final action sequence is relatively boring. And that's the main problem with this movie. While the plot of teleporting to a mysterious dimension is interesting (and I couldn't help wondering if the realm is the Negative Zone), the entire movie is plagued by a flat tone from which it never emerges. With the wealth of great material at their disposal from decades of fantastic comics (groan) this is a letdown. It doesn't help that it's a reboot of a franchise from less than ten years ago and so forces the audience to view ANOTHER origin story, which we don't need. The movie runs 100 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, West Vancouver, BC, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.GRADE: C-",Fantastic Four

28,StevePulaski,Succumbs to enough shortcomings to eventually crumble,4,10 August 2015,"""Fantastic Four"" is one of the most middling superhero films in recent memory, uniformly bleak, and not in a good way, drearily slow despite being such a short film, and entirely uninvolving, despite four proved charismatic actors at the forefront. The smothering sameness that carries through every shot, combined with the lack of any attachment to the four characters on-screen makes for a redundant, plodding excursion that drains nearly all the wonder out of the superhero formula and replaces it with soulless characters and a tired focus on the science.The plot: nearly lifelong friends Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) have been working on a prototype teleporter since they were in elementary school, and, upon showing it off at a science fare, attracted the attention of Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), the leading director of a government-sponsored research facility for the young and brilliant known as the Baxter Foundation. Reed and Ben work alongside a scientist known as Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and a technician known as Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) to create ""Quantum Gate,"" a more advanced teleporter crafted by Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell), which has the ability to teleport people to different dimensions.After a night of drinking to celebrate Quantum Gate's success, Reed, Ben, Johnny, and Victor decided to test out the invention and subsequently wind up being in a life-threatening situation in a totally different dimension of the universe. All but Victor return safely, thanks to the help of Sue, but the remaining survivors all exhibit some physical deformity. Reed is left able to stretch any limb of his body without limits, Sue is left with the capabilities to turn invisible, Johnny can make himself engulfed in flames at the blink of an eye, and Ben is left a towering monster made up of rocks. Together, the four grapple with their newfound powers in the midst of squaring off against Dr. Doom.The immediate problem with ""Fantastic Four"" is its pacing. It's the type of film that seems so focused on future installments that it forgets to operate in the present. We get a drearily paced origins story, amidst meticulous emphasis on the science behind teleporting, that writers Trank, Jeremy Slater, and Simon Kinberg forget to make what's occurring in the present of any interest. With that, upon the four heroes receiving their powers, Trank chooses to focus on the individual person being examined for their ailments, all while not adding any additional character development nor meaningful interaction with them whatsoever. It's as if we're arms length away from the characters, their agony, and their personalities at all time's and that arm's length stretches almost as far as Mr. Fantastic's arm can.You may remember Trank's directorial debut ""Chronicle,"" which rocked the box office back in 2012, making Trank amongst one of the few young directors to merit the honor of topping the box office with their first film. ""Chronicle""'s bleak nature, which housed found footage, superhero, and action film tendencies, was a brilliantly entertaining picture, and, to his credit, Trank replicates that sort of intriguingly dreary world, where everything seems melancholic. The problem is he fails to capitalize off of the environment, so the film carries this emptiness in the realm of why the environment is so ugly and the cinematography so dingy throughout the whole picture. It's a nice aesthetic, but with nothing juxtaposed or defined, it's as empty as the characters at hand.However, the rushed quality ""Fantastic Four"" bears is the ultimate nail-in-the-coffin. At ninety-five minutes, this is hardly an introduction but almost a prequel to the characters, ostensibly made up of odds and ends found on the cutting room floor. It's like watching a board game being set up before your eyes and, once every little thing is meticulously placed and every rule is read, the game is put back into a box to be open another day.The fact that gifted actors like Teller and Jordan and a clearly ambitious director like Trank signed onto ""Fantastic Four"" indicates that, at one point, there was a glimmer of hope for a franchise built around four unique characters with superhuman capabilities. That glimmer, however, with the looks of this finished product, has withered to little other than an agonizingly slow superhero film that make for the genre's worst in recent memory.",Fantastic Four
29,KineticSeoul,"Wow, poor Josh Trank",2,15 September 2015,"I just didn't expect Josh Trank the director that made ""Chronicle"" could make a movie worse than the previous 2 Fantastic Four movies. I mean I just didn't think it was hard to outdo the previous Fantastic Four movies. I am now glad that he got kicked out of directing, the new Star wars movie. Seriously though, not all faults should be placed on Josh Trank for this movie being as bad as it is. Fox got greedy, made budget cuts and didn't allow the director to have full control on this project. Which means, it was a last minute decision that really rushed this project. I mean just by watching the Comic Con interview for this movie, you could tell this movie is really bad. By the actors and the director not being enthusiastic or all that happy about the project they have worked on. In fact they all had this look after a horrific disaster. And just didn't seem to want to take credit for anything. I first thought the movie ""Ant-Man"" would be a dud and this would actually be the good one. But it turned out to be the opposite. For a young and up and coming director to tackle a big budget superhero movie, there was a lot of pressure on him. And when there is a lot of pressure but things are going nowhere the way you want things to go, it can make a man crack. And I think that is what ended up happening during the making of this movie. Still for a movie that has the budget of 120 million dollars. I thought it would at least be a watchable popcorn flick, but it wasn't even that. This movie was almost torture to sit through. Now I heard and read a lot of negative reviews when it comes to this movie. But I just didn't want to jump the bandwagon and hate this movie. So I kept looking for anything redeeming about this movie. But after 40 minutes in, all hope was lost. And the movie just kept on getting worse and worse. It's a superheroes movie, but there is like two small action sequences and it's all so forgettable and boring to watch. I mean the movie is just meshed with exposition after exposition which seemed to go nowhere. The first hour of this movie seemed like a really boring sci-fi movie involving scientist working on something, which involves space, planets and teleportation. But nothing is explained, and it's just generic as it gets when it comes to that matter. I mean why not just watch a movie that is actually focused on space travel and such like ""Interstellar""? Instead of this movie that just doesn't focus on the superheroes elements. The characters has little to no comradery, they were so cardboard like with zero personality. The pacing and editing when it comes to transition was poorly done. I really don't want to rip this movie apart, but it's just that bad. This movie is a waste of time. Just pass on this on, although most audiences that know a bit about the Marvel universe is going to watch it out of curiosity like I did.2/10",Fantastic Four

It's based on Marvel Comic's first superhero team, of the same name, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (their first comic as well); and tells the story of four young scientists who are transformed into gifted superheroes, by teleporting to another dimension. It was directed by Josh Trank (the man behind the 2012 indie sci-fi hit 'CHRONICLE') and written by Trank, Jeremy Slater and Simon Kinberg. The film stars Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan (who also costarred in 'CHRONICLE'), Kate Mara, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell and Reg E. Cathey. It's received nothing but negative reviews, from critics and fans alike, due to studio tampering; which greatly altered Trank's true vision. I really enjoyed the first two-thirds of the movie, and I'd really like to see a director's cut someday (which Trank insists exists). Since they met as children, best friends Reed Richards (Teller) and Ben Grimm (Bell) have been working on a special teleportation device. While showing it off, unsuccessfully at a science fair, they impress a local professor, Franklin Storm (Cathey); who's been working on the same thing. Storm invites Reed and Ben to join his research team; which includes his daughter Susan (Mara), his son Johnny (Jordan) and his protégé Victor von Doom (Kebbell). The young scientists succeed at their experiment, and then make a dangerous attempt to teleport themselves, to another universe. Once there, they gain special powers; and each must decide whether to use them for good, or for bad.The movie begins as a fascinating character study, filled with good performances (from Teller, Jordan and the rest). It's involving, although somewhat slow paced, and pretty entertaining, all the way up till the third act. Then the film morphs into a completely different movie, and ends with CGI filled nonsense (with characters behaving in ways nothing like the film leading up to it). Fox was unhappy with Trank's first cut (a more original, and creative, character driven superhero flick), so they hijacked the movie; demanding reshoots and totally ruining the conclusion of the film. I really like what Trank was trying to do with the genre, before that though, and look forward to seeing more from him in the future. I also hope the upcoming sequel doesn't have so much big business pollution. It's at least not as big of a disappointment as Marvel Studio's 'ANT-MAN' (considering what that could have been, with Edgar Wright at the helm)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaTQgKVh7fQ",Fantastic Four
31,thesar-2,What the Hell Did I Just See?,2,14 August 2015,"Am I being too generous with giving this 2 stars out of 10?Is it the worst I've ever seen? Is it even the worst superhero/comic book adaptation I've viewed? No, but damn, this was a nothing movie. And that's too bad. The first part, the ""origin,"" or character introduction scenes, if you are willing, had promise. In fact, all the way through the first 20-30 minutes I was wondering what all the negative buzz was about. It wasn't great, had some incredibly miscast characters and dumb coincidences, but it was acceptable.But then minute 31 (or so) happened and I literally couldn't believe my eyes. I had no clue to what this movie was doing. It shifted into a movie somewhere lost in this movie. Almost like this was the very first draft, written on a cocktail napkin and never once edited or improved on from that idea. I saw something here, but it needed more substance, heart, a longer running time and most of allaction, or them just being ""Fantastic.""Instead of anything that would make a superhero or comic book adaptation seem justified, they settled for skipping an entire year of ""could've been cool scenes"" and barely showed anything ""super"" in the background. It would be like Martha Kent telling Lois Lane all about the Smallville fight and us just seeing a blurred 5-second news clip from her 19"" B&W TV across the room in Man of Steel.Worse, they never let you get involved in the characters, threw in clichéd tension, scenes missing without our knowledge, but then talked about as if we should have known what happened and had one of the laziest and least thought out climaxes (or conflicts) in superhero movie history. Hell, in any action movie. In any movie. Don't even get me started on the hilarious Dr. Doom'ed.What I was left with was a giant question mark above my head on how did this get made? Most likely this was made for the studio to keep the rights, like they did with the terrible The Amazing Spider-Man, but how did they see the end product and say: Yes, this is quality. Yes, this makes sense. Yes, people will see this 10 times each and make more than The Avengers. I was never a fan of the original two movies and only saw them one time apiece when they originally came out. Thinking back, now after seeing this sad mess of a poor effort, I actually am rethinking my opinion on those. Corny, sure, but at least they had action. At least they showed the team repeatedly working together to save humanity. At least there was the basic follow-through with superhero origin stories. At least I cared to see ANY ONE OF THEM live until the end.Again, this movie started off not-too-bad, but then turned all Hancock and just blew my mindin the wrong direction.",Fantastic Four

33,Robert_duder,A really disappointing mess,6,12 August 2015,"I was fully prepared to ignore the bad reviews and horrible opening numbers and enjoy this anyways. I figured the ""die-hard"" fans were simply rallying against it and I'm not a Fantastic Four buff (always been a DC comics guy) but I do enjoy a great Superhero movie. Fox has made clear this is a ""re-imagining"" of the Fantastic Four and that's putting it lightly. The majority of the film is an origin story and the rest of it is a mess. The hour and a half run time which is brutally short for a Superhero flick spends SO much time opening the story and the entire film could have been told in 15 minutes so that you could get down to the brass tacks and actually have a big action flick. The film wasn't the worst I've ever seen by any means. It was watchable but it was also a mess. The cast was completely misplaced, the story is incredibly weak, the pacing is awful and it simply isn't Fantastic Four at all. I personally think Fantastic Four is simply one of those superheroes that is very hard to translate to live action. They are campy and silly and fit better in the comics world. However, I agree with what many are saying that this film made the 2005 version look much, much better. At the very least the casting for the 2005 version was significantly better.Miles Teller is very talented and he is becoming a front runner for hot commodities in Hollywood especially after his head turning performance in Whiplash last year. Teller is better than this film. Reed should not be this young and the character is not developed at all so Teller has nothing to work with. I think he's trying his best but the direction of the character does nothing so he, and the rest of the main cast, seem out of place and almost bored. Michael B. Jordan caught a lot of flack simply because he was going to play an African American Johnny Storm. I don't care about his colour but exactly like Teller he is given nothing to work with. At least they gave Chris Evans a sense of humour in the 2005 version. I will say the same thing about Kata Mara and Jamie Bell...no development, seem bored, and way too broody. All four of them are depressed and look depressing and have no chemistry together at all. Jamie Bell's Thing who is usually the highlight of the Fantastic Four (Michael Chiklis was the best thing to come out of the 2005 version no pun intended) is boring and grunts and groans with zero personality. Mara just looks angry all the time but then they all do. I honestly don't blame the cast one bit. I have seen them all in good roles. I think the direction and script was terrible. Toby Kebbell plays Victor Von Doom and although I think he should have been much older and a well known actor, he actually does an okay job compared to the rest of the cast. I actually enjoyed his look (although the fact that his mouth didn't move seemed cheesy) and he could have been a decent villain if not for the bad story and how long it took to get to him in general. Reg Cathey and Tim Blake Nelson are the rest of the main supporting cast and they're decent in their respective roles.Everyone knows now the viral tweet from director Josh Trank about how his vision a year ago was much better. I honestly find that hard to believe. Even if the studio requested changes, there isn't even really much potential to this particular rendition/story. Its too far removed from the original Fantastic Four concept and the characters are downright bland as we discussed. The pacing is terrible and the best parts of the film are the final battle which lasts ten minutes while the build up is 1 hour and 20 minutes. The run time is ludicrous for a film of this type and he would have to add an awful lot to make this worthwhile in my opinion. Now all that bashing being said...I didn't hate it. It was okay at best. I remember sort of breezing through another iteration of this film in the 90's that was made just to keep the rights and thinking it looked dumb but passable and that's what this is too. I don't really care who holds the rights, I don't think this can be done properly in live action. This one is completely forgettable and you can watch the 2005 version and have more fun at least. 6/10",Fantastic Four
34,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"One of the most boring, vapid and soulless super-hero films in a long time.",4,17 April 2018,"'Fantastic Four (2015)' is genuinely one of the most boring superhero films I've seen in a long time. This vapid and soulless studio affair feels like the product of several suited silhouettes and is indicative of everything wrong with both the genre and the studio system as a whole, as it totally encapsulates the phrase 'running out of steam' and was gutted of its entire middle portion. It seriously seems as though no-one involved could muster up more than a sigh's worth of enthusiasm, truly appearing as though the entire feature was only made so that Fox could keep hold of the rights to the franchise. The picture bizarrely has very little of the four actually doing anything fantastic until the underwhelming finale. The tone is so dour that even the quote unquote 'fun stuff' is bland and, frankly, a chore to watch, something that could also be said of the entire piece. 4/10",Fantastic Four

It takes forever to get going and boasts scintillating dialogue like ""Lets get the hell out of here"".

But I'm plainly not the audience for this sort of thing.",Fantastic Four
36,ThomasDrufke,Doomed,3,6 August 2015,"There have been several memorable blockbusters this summer. I cant say it's as good as 2015 should have been, but I still loved quite a few films. Whether it was the nerdy spectacle of Age of Ultron, the action masterpiece that was Mad Max: Fury Road, the nostalgic Jurassic World, the fresh and unique Ant-Man, or the high octane thrill ride that was Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation, this summer had some great moments. Sadly, Fantastic Four is by far the most disappointing film to come out this year. I really thought that after the garbage first two films Fox may have had a handle on how to make a film based on these beloved characters, but I was wrong. I don't know yet if I think this is a worse film than the previous two, but it deserves a lower score for failing to separate themselves from those films. It's really a shame, even after all the behind the scenes reported issues with this film, (which I will choose to ignore in this review) I had high hopes for this one. The trailers sold me. I love this cast and I really liked Chronicle, Josh Tranks first film. Plus, the sci-fi/horror approach was far better than the campy first two. Boy was I way off on my expectations.The film is worse than reported. There are only a few redeemable qualities to the film. But I think the worst part about this film is just how slow and boring it is. I understand the different approach, but when you have a marketing push that stressed how fun and action packed the film was, you become really disappointed with how poorly this film is put together. There is one action scene and it's the end of the film. Even that was a huge letdown and actually rather quick. The film is only 100 minutes long, which has to be a low for superhero films. I'm trying not to succumb to rumors, but you have to wonder what went wrong considering this film feels so jumbled and convoluted that it seems like an 8th grader could have put it together. Not to mention how noticeably bad some of the CGI was. Especially the other dimension scene. It honestly looked like a Disney channel TV show decided to use green screen for an episode and looks entirely different than the show has ever looked. But going back to the marketing, the trailers show much more than what is actually in the film so I wonder how many deleted scenes there are.But I cant deny that I did like some of the film. Even though the way they decide to travel themselves to the other dimension is incredibly silly, I loved the aftermath and the horrific feeling and ominous tone set during those scenes. Ben and Reed really stood out to me here. The Fantastic Four really are normal people who accidentally get powers and have to deal with the damage both internally and externally that they can do. That's one of the reasons I was excited to see the movie, the trailers pushed the horror elements. And while they are here, they feel like they are from a totally different film. It's only a few times that this tone is present throughout the film, the other times it's a goofy semi-action flick. I really cant blame the actors. They do the best they can with the direction and writing they were given. The writing is wretched by the way. 3 or 4 times I got goosebumps because of how cringe worthy some of the dialogue was, and that's saying something considering how bad the first two were.Overall I was inexplicably disappointing with this film. It's a messy action film that is at times a comedy but wants to add horror or even an end of the world type of film. Which is another thing they didn't really explain, the end of the world. The whole film they are stressing that the research of the characters is necessary to save the world but I never heard exactly why it needed saving? There is really nothing memorable about this film. And the only redeemable part about the film is how cool the brief horror scenes were. Doom looks terrible, just one last thought.+Brief horror elements -CGI was bad, really bad -Weak script -Tone shifts too much -Nothing exciting happens, not even the final ""fight""-Jumbled plot 3.7/10",Fantastic Four
37,Cineanalyst,Grimm and Doomed World Building,2,12 September 2020,"That this ""Fantastic Four"" reboot is darkly lit and otherwise grim in tone doesn't bother me too much, nor does the reported unfaithfulness to the comics, which I wouldn't be aware of if not told. I can even overlook re-shoot wigs. But, it's severely flawed in every other way, too. A lot of time is spent on silly science-y stuff, while the characters remain ill-defined beyond typical movie relationship shorthand: the loyalty between brother, sister and father; the love triangle between two scientists for the girl; and the childhood friendship from two broken homes. Then, there's the exploitation of the youngsters, from being sold on an education as they, instead, work in a laboratory for a profit-seeking institution, to basically being enslaved by the military. The movie does nothing to resolve the incongruity of its team planting the American flag on another planet while they bemoan the military industrial complex on their own Earth. Instead, we get an origins story that's blatantly formulaic in the studio's pursuit to make a (as we now know, failed) franchise out of it.The big problem isn't that the movie is ridiculously vague about what is dooming the Earth or how imminent it is in the movie, nor that Dr. Doom sets out to build a world that is even grimmer than that of the movie's Earth. No, it's that the world the makers of the movie set out to build is as hollow and exploitative as the institutions within the movie that the youngsters butt their heads against. Perhaps, if the filmmaking team realized how hypocritical this picture is, it wouldn't have turned out so dull. There's nothing fantastic about this.",Fantastic Four
38,ericstevenson,The pits,2,30 April 2017,"I was simply amazed that with all the mass success of Marvel films in general that we actually got a film this awful. This is one of the most reviewed films by Internet critics ever created. I think at least eight people have taken a shot at this, even though some of them weren't technically episodes of their show. You knew the Nostalgia Critic would get to it eventually. So why is this film so horrible? It actually repeats a lot of mistakes the other ones did! It has Doctor Doom being jealous with Reed over Sue and the effects are still bad, especially with Reed's arms.The pacing in this film is among the worst I have ever seen in my life. We are so used to live-action superhero movies being two hours long, you know it would fail with this length. I think it's this length simply because 100 (minutes) is a very nice even number. Oh, this is the fourth Fantastic Four movie and still no good ones! It isn't until halfway through the entire movie that the characters get their superpowers. Even after that, it isn't until four fifths in the movie that we actually see the characters all together! I'm serious! The constant use of darkness is so obnoxious. Why is the Thing naked? In fact, why do they not even use their superhero names until the very end? Even then, only half of them use their names. This film is so soulless with no humor at all as at least the other movies had some light hearted moments. The worst line is probably when Doom says, ""There is no Victor. There is only Doom"". Uh...Victor and Doom are the same person. Everything is horribly rushed in such a boring film. Well, this is the last film for Superhero Month and it's sad we ended on such a bad note.

The comic's congenial tone is as absent as the chemistry between Reed and Sue and the Thing's pants.

44,ironhorse_iv,"Movie wasn't Fantastic, but it's not as bad, as critics make it out to be.",4,11 August 2015,"Like the 1994 Roger Corman's film with the same name, this film was made so Fox could keep the film rights for the Fantastic Four, rather than, having it reverted to Marvel Studios. Based on their ""Ultimate Marvel"" origin by Mark Miller, the movie directed by Josh Trank, serves as a continuity reboot for 20th Century Fox's Fantastic Four film franchise, and has no connection to the 3 previous films. Its story follows Reed Richards (Miles Teller), a brilliant scientist researching travel into another dimension. However, when a test involving him and 3 other subjects goes horribly wrong, the four must adapt to their rapidly changing bodies, while preventing those around them wanting to exploit Reed's research for personal gain. Can Reed protect his research or will the bad guys win? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, unlike the previous version, this one features a much younger version of the heroes with lots of teen appeal: Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, and Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm. The fact that they're very young, is kinda jarring. I really didn't buy them, as scientists, most of the time. The acting from them, was alright, but very dull. The writers didn't give them, much to work with. The dialogue was very humorless grim, exposition driven. The pacing for the film really show this. It drags for so long, that much of the movie is spent on the set up and exposition. Then, when it got good, with the Cronenbergian Body Horror. The pacing skips time, turning the film into a more standard superhero tones. I really wish, they show how were able to control their powers, rather than skipping ahead a year and showing that everybody's fine. Yet despite all this drawn-out buildup to the creation of the interdimensional machine, the movie never takes the time to actually have Reed, the Storms, and Grimm really get to know each other or to let the audience get to know them. Whatever bonding they had happened off-screen. So when the team finally gets together for the final act battle against Dr. Doom (Toby Kebbell); it's really hard to believe. Somehow, but they come off, more like resembles a dysfunctional Family than an actual surrogate family. Sue Storm comes off way too standoffish, when it comes to Reed Richards talking to her. Aren't them, supposed to be lovers? Both barely have any chemistry or any charm. I really don't believe, these two characters, honestly like each other, in this version. Ben and Reed's relationship could also need some work. I barely think of them, as friends. The movie even taints Ben's catchphrase ""It's clobberin' time!"" by associating it with what his big brother would say before beating him as a child! Also, why is Johnny such a dick? He barely knows Reed and Ben, but he acts so mean, for no reason. I really don't buy that they were, able to work together, during the action scenes. Sorry. While, the film is less violence than in many other Marvel-based adaptations. It's a little more, gruesome, than the other films. Near the end, there are tons of multiple deaths, some of them fairly gory. Still, the action is very limited and short. It was very disappointing. Not much, entertainment value there. The film's visual effects are fairly mediocre. The Thing never quite looks like anything other than a CGI character, lacking the more photorealistic quality other films finally managed to achieve with other monster-like characters. I didn't care, that he was nude, like other critics, did. I didn't find it, jarring. After all, there are tons of nude monster superheroes. I also didn't mind, the negative zone AKA Planet Zero's visual effects. They were pretty good. I also didn't mind, that Dr. Doom wanted to control it. I just wish, they make Dr. Doom look better. Why didn't they listen to lot of complaints that Doom looks like a homeless person wearing burned trash bags after his transformation. I do have to complain that the ""metallic face"" look, doesn't work. Just give him, a mask! In my opinion, I have to agree with some people claiming he looked like a crash test dummy. He was by far, the worst thing in the film. One thing, that I had to disagree with the critics and some fans, is their hatred for the casting of African American actor Michael B. Jordan's for the traditionally-Caucasian Human Torch. I found those critics to be suffering from a big case of xenophobe. There is nothing wrong with this casting. Some critics argued that he received the role because he was friends with the director, but I think, it was based solely on his acting ability. Plus, I think the movie made a good explanation of why Sue Storm looks so different, from Johnny. Anyways, I do have to say, the actor, Reg E. Cathey playing their father, Franklin Storm, did an amazing job, in his limited role. One person that didn't live up to his role is the director. The film was shot in overall claustrophobic environment. It looks like it was shot almost entirely inside a dark storage unit. It didn't help that Josh Trank show up, drunk and high, during filming. During production, he was very combative and abusive toward the cast, producers, and crew. Plus, there is no end-credit-scene in this movie or a cameo of Stan Lee. WTF! Director Josh Trank outburst after the film's release, following the rumored incredibly Troubled Production, probably severely damage this film. A sequel was officially slated, long before the film was even released. However, plans may change after the movie was hit with extremely negative critical reception from critics and audiences alike and an absolutely bad opening weekend. Overall: Fant4stic isn't unwatchable or that awful. It's just really mundane, and devoid of any fun. Marvel's First Family deserves better.",Fantastic Four

46,Reno-Rangan,"Too slow and dramatised superhero flick, but acceptable.",6,14 December 2015,"I can't say I liked the previous films and not this one. In fact, I kind of enjoyed watching this reboot. It was much better than what I have heard about it. At least it did not sound like a loud and lousy like any modern sci-fi flicks, chasing bad guys, bombing cities and downing buildings. But as a superhero and sci-fi film, it had its moment, only at the end.Obviously the film was too slow and dramatisation was a backslash keeping the youngsters (audience) in mind. I actually expected hefty stunt sequences. Without actions, a superhero movie is like a limbless spider and toothless shark. If the web and tooth are the superpowers, then they must handle it quite smartly. So that is where this film failed to be a clever. This film had 4 superheroes and until the climax they were impotent. Which means the only superhero movie in the recent time that meant for older people. Precisely to say, if you are a 30+, you might enjoy it as I did. I know I can't talk for you and what kind of movies you like, but I know todays youngsters who refuse dramas and accept action-adventures.I agree it did not deliver as it should have been as a theatrical feature where surround speakers are ready to give us a breathtaking sound mix. I felt it some kind of a television episode. Because that is how the modern television series are presented. Personally, I would like to say that don't mind my words and the review, because I usually enjoy all the films I watch. So this one was average to me, but definitely not a bad and I won't slam it. Though I recommend it for old people who does not like modern high-octane stunts.6/10",Fantastic Four
47,tomgillespie2002,An unnecessarily grim experience,2,18 November 2015,"Unless you have been living under a rock these past few months or pay little attention to online chatter, Fantastic Four arrived with the heavy stigma of delays, on-set bust-ups, last minute re-shoots, and overwhelmingly negative reviews from both critics and the few people that actually paid to see it. Sadly, the film is every bit as bad as you've heard. The Fantastic Four have had a troublesome history, with Roger Corman's infamous 1994 film never being released at all and Tim Story's colourful but soulless 2005 effort getting a panning from the critics, and Josh Trank's follow-up to the excellent anti-superhero flick Chronicle (2012) carries on this trend, getting lost amidst a forced darkness and a tug-of-war of control between director and producers.The ambitious Reed Richards (Miles Teller) struggles to get backing for his new teleportation device despite the assistance of his dim but loyal best friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell). At a science fair, he is finally noticed by Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara), who are also working on a similar device but are struggling to perfect it. Teaming up with rebellious technician Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) and morbid hacker Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell), Reed and his crew set out to develop a 'Quantum Gate' which will transport them to another dimension. Fearing their limelight will be stolen by NASA, Reed, Johnny, Ben and Victor suit up and are travel to a mysterious planet covered by a strange energy source. When they return, they are transformed forever.The young cast do their very best with their often cringe-worthy material, with Teller and Jordan in particular proving charismatic stand-outs. But they are kept apart for the majority of the film and given very little time to bond as a group both before and after the accident that turns them into superheroes. Instead, we get a lot of lonesome brooding and superficial angst during a frustratingly drawn-out build-up, with Mara and Bell given little attention at all. Then the film decides to skip over what is usually the most part of a superhero origin flick - the heroes learning to use their powers - as Reed escapes the compound now controlled by shady supervisor Dr. Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) and the team spending an extended period trying to track him down. After all the procrastinating, the foursome struggle to generate any chemistry at all.The producers were apparently unsatisfied by Trank's final cut and ordered heavy re-shoots for the film's climax. Never has behind-the- scenes tampering been so obvious in a finished product, as we are given a rushed and confused final set-piece and a film that feels somehow overlong despite a slim 90 minute running time. In a hastily deleted tweet, Twank informed fans that there was a final cut that would have garnered good reviews and improved its terrible box- office return, but we will never know if this is true or not. What we are left with is a limping and unnecessarily grim experience that will hopefully allow the film rights to be passed back to Marvel, who seem to be the only company capable of doing their characters justice. Fantastic Four will no doubt be a irremovable stain on the careers of its talented cast and director.",Fantastic Four

The original 2005 and its 2007 sequel had a light comedy aspect which made it entertaining- although those weren't necessarily great, both those films were better than this remake, as they didn't take themselves too serious.Another reason is that the villain is brought up until very late and with no build up or establishment and the fight scene did not last long. It was also quite predictable. Then the film just ends abruptly as it was clear a sequel was intended.Perhaps Fantastic Four isn't the worst superhero film but given its budget and the time it was released (during the golden age of superhero films) it is most definitely a big disappointment.",Fantastic Four
49,eddie_baggins,We'll never know what happened to this superhero oddity,4,28 April 2016,"It's highly likely that we'll never understand fully just what happened behind the scenes of Fantastic Four to make it the film it is today.It's a film that even the most pessimistic of comic book haters, popcorn disliking, nerd despising, anti-movie fiends couldn't have predicted the amount of hate thrown its way and the ill will that Josh Trank's second feature film received upon release.Box Office receipts were dire, critics tore shreds of a film they labelled ""boring"" or ""to dark"" and many including audiences were bemused at how this supposed comic book film floated by for near on an hour of running time to then descend into a chaotic final act of atrocious CGI and one of modern movie history's most poorly constructed and underdeveloped villains.The mystery surrounding Fantastic Four's failure flows from studio interference, including the studio butchering a rushed re-edit of the film before release, director Josh Trank's bizarre on set behaviours and mismanagement of actors and all manner of script writers for hire coming in and having a go at trying to make something of Trank's clearly going for bleak re-telling of an already previously mismanaged franchise (Silver Surfer anyone?). Considering all the hatred and lacklustre talk surrounding this film, upon reflection on home release, Fantastic Four isn't actually ""that"" bad.It's certainly not a good film, actually it's very far from it but in 2015 there were a lot of seriously bad movies and at least for lack of a better word, Fantastic Four tried. It's not the usual action set piece after action set piece comic book film we've grown to know and love and then grow tired of and Trank and his team clearly had some decent ideas.Bursting onto the scene with his found footage Sci-Fi Chronicle, the once bright career of Trank seems destined to be clouded in controversy after his efforts here but there are moments of genuine cinematic quality. The way in which our fantastic team of unsuspecting super powered humans discover their abilities is effective and the casting seems mainly on point.We all know the talents of Whiplash's Miles Teller, Fruitvale Station's and Creed's Michael B. Jordan and the likes of Jamie Bell, Kate Mara and Toby Kebbell are no slouches but whoever in the end edited, constructed and wrote this film killed Fantastic Four's chances to fly with some of the most poorly designed editing, character development and plot advancements in recent memory and not once do we feel any real connection with these people or believe that they share any form of chemistry whatsoever and the films aforementioned final act is bewilderingly bad, the only excuse it would have would be the studio's so called interference.It's somewhat of a shame we will never get to know just what ruined this glum and often more dramatically natured Fantastic Four outing that at the end of the day has nothing even remotely memorable about it other than the fact it's so downright lacking in energy, humour/lightness and a seemingly lack of effort.The cast was there and no doubt willing but due to a raft of seemingly powerful situations this film ended up being a real non-event, certainly not as unwatchable in its terribleness that many would've had us believe, but certainly a messy, sporadically entertaining attempt at finally making the Fantastic Four a viable big screen staple.2 gum chewing head honchos out of 5",Fantastic Four
50,leonblackwood,Waste of time and money. 2/10,2,1 February 2016,"Review: What a load of rubbish! None of the new characters have the screen charisma as the original ones and the whole dark, gloomy feel of the movie, just didn't work. I totally got fed up with the technical jargon, which took up the first hour of the film and the movie seemed to jump from when they got there powers to them being used as weapons by the US government, so you don't see them exploring with there newly found powers. The ""Thing"" looked like a total mess and Doom just looked like a man in a suit with green eyes. The chemistry between the characters was also pretty bad, until they come together at the end and you don't really get to see any detail, because of its dark look. The storyline lacked wit and I got fed up with the stupid teleporting machine, which took up most of the movies concept. I'm glad that I got that off of my chest! Anyway, best friends Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) have been working on a prototype teleporter since childhood and during a demonstration, they get the attention of Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), whose the director of the Bacteria Foundation, a government sponsored research institute for young prodigies. Reed gets invited to join Storms squad, which includes his adopted daughter, Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and his son Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to complete a Quantum Gate, which was originally designed by the wayward Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell). Victor eventually joins the team, especially when he hears that Sue is on board and after a successful experiment, the facilities supervisor Dr. Harvey Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) plans to send a group from NASA to venture into a parallel dimension called Planet Zero. As Reed, Sue, Johnny and Victor came up with the initial idea for the machine, they decide to make the first journey to Planet Zero but Sue decides to stay behind to guide them. Reed recruits his best friend, Ben to join them on the journey and when they reach Planet Zero, they see some weird green lava, which Victor attempts to touch and causes it to erupt. Whilst running for there life's from the green lava, Victor is left behind because of the collapsing landscape and the others are brought back to earth by Sue, who overrides the controls. They then realise that they have super human powers, due to the explosion that happened in there ship while they were trying to escape from the lava and they are placed in government custody for further testing. Reed can stretch like rubber, Sue can become invisible and generate force fields of energy, Johnny can fly and turn into fire and Ben is a giant rock type figure who has amazing strength. Reed escapes from the facility and tries to find a cure for his friends while Johnny Storm is being used as a weapon for the government. After being in hiding for a year, Sue tracks down Reed and Ben is sent to bring him back to the facility. Now, with there new enhanced suits, they head back to Planet Zero to try and find a cure for there powers and they find Victor who has all of there powers along with telekinetic abilities, so they bring him back to facility, only to find out that he wants to destroy earth so he can rebuild Planet Zero in his image. Victor uses his powers to kill scientists and soldiers, including Dr. Allen and Professor Storm and he returns to Planet Zero with the four scientists in pursuit. Now under the name of Doom, Victor activates a portal that begins to consume the landscape of earth. He is then confronted by the four and after getting beaten down by Doom, they join forces and Ben punches Doom into the portals energy beam while Johnny closes the portal. When they return to earth, they are awarded for there heroics, with a huge operational base and they decide to call themselves the Fantastic Four. Sounds good on paper but it was complete rubbish. I must admit, the first franchise was a bit childish, with some unrealistic concepts but it was much better than this. At least they had some decent actors! With all of these studios rebooting there comic book franchises, after the success of the darker Batman, I'm not surprised that they wanted to reboot the Fantastic Four but they made a right shambles of it. Due to hype, it made a decent profit at the box office which proves that a movie doesn't have to be good to make money. Anyway, they really need to go back to the drawing board with this one because the whole thing was a right mess. Awful!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Josh Trank, 31, who brought you Chronicle in 2012. For his second project, I think he took on a franchise that really needed someone with some more experience and he over complicated the storyline when he really didn't have to. Everyone is familiar with the history of the Fantastic Four so he didn't have to come up with a technical reason for there powers. If he does come out with a sequel, he really needs to concentrate on the characters more that the technical references, which are really not that interesting.Budget: $120million Worldwide Gross: $168millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies starring Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell, Reg E. Cathey and Tim Blake Nelson. 2/10",Fantastic Four
51,TheMovieDiorama,Fant4stic is the epitome of doomed reboots.,2,2 June 2018,"Fant-4-Stic. Fantastic Four. Fant4stic Four. 4 Fant4stic. Fant-I honestly don't give a damn-stic. Well, everyone said it was dreadful. After years of avoidance, I finally took the plunge and delved into the modern reimagining of The Fantastic Four. Someone hold me! I can't. To formulate a review would be the equivalent of approaching 20th Century Fox and asking ""can you give the rights back to Marvel?"". They'll show you the exit. Ohhh...this was terrible. Reed Richards, with the help of a ""scientific"" team, devise an inter dimensional teleportation device where one journey causes the team to gain powerful abnormalities. Where do I even start!? This is clearly Fox's fault. I can only assume that director Trank had a clear vision, and at times there are glimpses of greatness, but the studio had to get involved to keep the rights to the franchise and quickly release this reboot before they were offered to another distributor. Rushed is an understatement. You don't need to be a film critic or aficionado to notice the abhorrent production issues. Mara wearing a wig one scene and not the next, the rapidest anti-climatic third act ever, horrendous visual effects (ewww) and no attention to creating a riveting screenplay. I can't even claim the script to be mediocre, it's just the worst. 'Fant4stic: Plot Conveniences Strike Back' would've been more apt. None of it makes sense. Every line of dialogue is spoken with such monotony and only acts as a necessary mean to further the unimaginative plot, resulting in no character development. Every cast member was terribly miscast. Teller wasn't trying, Jordan couldn't be bothered, Mara was dull as always, Bell had no opportunities and Kebbell was criminally misused. No emotional connection between these characters in the slightest. Heck, Johnny had a more emotive friendship in the first five seconds of meeting Reed than he did with his own sister! Why attend school fairs? How did Victor survive a year? Where did the cape come from!? This isn't a film, it's a tool!! A god damn tool!! Fantastic this is not.",Fantastic Four
52,Vartiainen,Sad... just sad,1,6 September 2016,"You know when they say that something doesn't make you angry, but disappointed instead. I never really got that properly until I saw this film. 20th Century Fox owns the rights to Fantastic Four, but the caveat apparently is that they have to utilize those rights by making a film every now and then, or they revert back to Marvel. And thus we get this sad and pathetic attempt at trying to keep these famous characters out of the hands of those that would actually know what to do with them.And don't get me wrong, it's not like the original 2005 Fantastic Four was a great film either. We all saw it, sure, because it was the beginning of the superhero film boom, but it paled when compared to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man or the original X-Men trilogy. But it was decent. Not great, but certainly serviceable. It least it got Chris Evans, of Captain America fame, started with the superhero thing.Whereas this movie just... exists. Sure, the special effects have improved - even though I actually like the originals better because at least they had a distinct style and had some colour in them - but it doesn't really matter if the story has no soul. I mean, the beginning is stolen straight from Spider-Man, the middle part is exactly like X-Men and the final battle eerily reminds us of Man of Steel. So, with that last one, they couldn't even be bothered to rip-off good films. That's how lazy they are.You know you've seen a bad film when you're having difficulties explaining just what was wrong with it due it being so absolutely uninspired and boring. Please don't see this film. Not worth it.",Fantastic Four
53,subxerogravity,It's a lot better if you don't know anything about the comic book superheroes.,4,8 August 2015,"So I just herd that similar to the Roger Corman's unreleased version of the Fantastic Four, this movie was made so that Fox could hold on to the Marvel Characters, and I assume, just like that movie they rush into production, which is very noticeable.I'm still a champion of casting Micheal B. Jordan as the human Torch. He was the right fit and did great with what he was given, which was not much. With that said, I feel he may have been the first domino knocked over that lead to a series of events that made this far different than the comic book it was based on.I understand the need to update a story written in 1961 for a audience far more knowledgeable about things and that like to see superheroes more grounded to Earth, but what I saw here showed some lack of respect for the World's Greatest Comic Magazine.Miles Teller walked the walked but did not talk the talk. I feel sorry for Jamie Bell because his version of the Thing only proves that Michael Chiklis nailed it in the 2005 adaption of the movie.As a movie, especially a superhero movie, the big problem is that we wait too long for the superheroes to show up and do something. By the time they do show up and do something we lost interest in anything they were doing.I'm... satisfied with the actors in the role, but feel the story does not allow them to be the Fantastic Four. I understand this is an origin story, but even in Iron Man, we knew what type of person Tony Stark was before he put on the suit, and he was an interesting person. With the Fantastic Four, none of these guys could keep my interest for the whole movie, I just stopped caring. The movie feels more like a pilot episode for an upcoming TV show, especially with it's very short running time, which I can't complain about, but I did feel sort of jipped, like I went to a defected theater that accidentally left out a huge chuck of the picture. Dr. Doom now holds the crown as the worse villain in a superhero movie. I known he's the group's archenemy, but his whole appearance feels like they are force feeding him to us for no real reason. It's not uncommon for these marvel movies to have weakly done antagonist, but once again this Dr. Doom shows a complete lack of respect for the original material. I will give the movie credit for it's visual effects. The scene were the team gets their powers is actual really cool. I could feel the pain and discomfort as Reed Richards body stretches for the first time.But overall, I know society still does not view comic books on the level as say a Steven King or JK Rowling Novel, but the reason this movie is so corny is because the filmmakers felt they could do whatever they wanted with these icons and no one would care. Maybe it's not all their fault, this is the third attempt to adapt Marvel's first superhero team, and each time it gets cornier. Third time is not the charm.",Fantastic Four
54,jamesrupert2014,Surprisingly good,8,5 August 2016,"This film had been so panned upon release that I didn't bother to watch it until recently, when couldn't find anything else of interest on Netflix. Why the movie was (is) so poorly regarded is beyond me. The principal cast (and their material) were better than that of the 2005/2007 versions (admittedly faint praise) and the story, while a bit slow to get rolling, was good: lean and straightforward, as befits the source material. The movie avoids the silly 'comic relief' filler that permeates much of this genre and provides moderately 'adult entertainment' (at least by the standards of superhero movies). The special effects, especially the scenes on the alternate world, were good as was the realization of the ""Four's"" powers. Having seen most of the Marvel and DC competition, (including the 'pre-boots'), etc, I would rank this in the top 25%. Recommended.",Fantastic Four
55,DarkVulcan29,"Bad, but not quite the disaster has everybody makes it out to be.",5,10 August 2015,"I actually liked the first two Fantastic Four films, which came out in 2005 and 2007. They where fun entertaining films, they never try to be anything more then that. But critics think otherwise, and that is why they demanded a reboot.This film is bad, but not Batman and Robin(1997) or Superman 4(1987) bad. I see there was some effort put in here, but I feel the effort stopped along the along way. I heard stories that it had trouble production, and it shows a little on camera. The movie feels like it was cut down, feeling like there where too many scenes that are missing. Now the effects are pretty descent, even when they are using there powers.Has for the actors, Miles Teller as Reed Richards does a good enough job, showing how much he does cares about the production, and you clearly see it in his performance. But Kate Mara and Jamie Bell as Sue Storm and Ben Grimm are terrible, not that they are bad actors, but both of them are clearly sleepwalking through this, I see a lack of interest while watching them in this. I've seen better acting from Jamie Bell, and when his character becomes The Thing, he is still not that interesting, Michael Chiklis gave more too it, in both Fantastic 4 films. And Kate Mara I don't think is a bad actress, but feeling she deserves better after this and last years Transcendence. Michael B. Jordan has Johnny Storm is not bad, but I feel he was not giving much to work with, unlike Chris Evans. Toby Kebbell is alright as Doom, he gives more into his performance than anybody.All in all it's bad, but not all terrible, I feel there was a better film hiding in there some where.",Fantastic Four
56,generationofswine,An Honest Review,2,16 November 2016,"This isn't the Fantastic Four, the characters aren't the same. The Thing, Mr. Fantastic, Sue, Johnny, even Doom are totally different than they are from the source material, totally different than they were in any of the movies. It's not just the usual movie deviations, these just aren't the Fantastic Four.Doom is the worst of the bunch. He was sort of a good guy, and then became evil for no describable reason. They sort of glossed over his transformation into the Big Bad with a brief explanation that made little sense on the whole. Just accept it, just say that you understand and get on with the movie.The movie, well, two-thirds of it is a set up and a necessary one. They not only have to set up the characters but take the time to explain how outstandingly different they are from the Fantastic Four everyone knows. It takes up the bulk of the movie.And then the final third rushed in a panicked sort of way. Hey, here is the action, here is the conflict that needs to be resolved, let's do it all as fast as we can.And it's all for a darker feel that fails to be dark and turns into a parody of itself. They did the same thing with a little more success in the Amazing Spider Man reboot, where they turned Peter into a bully rather than a lovable smart alack.In both reboots, it didn't really work, in both films it turned them into a parody of themselves, setting the scene for a lackluster film that audiences hated.And that is after the first two films disappointed audiences.I guess the lesson here is, ""if you aren't going to make it better, don't bother to make it.""",Fantastic Four

Jordan- Fruitvale Station, Red Tails, he is also playing Apollo Creed's son in the upcoming movie Creed; Jamie Bell-Man On a Ledge, Jumper and Toby Kebbell- The Counselor, War Horse.This is a reboot of the Fantastic Four franchise from 2005 that is Not your father's Fantastic Four. It is based loosely on the 2004 Ultimate FF comic book series, but it even veers from there, too. It is directed by Josh Trank, who directed Chronicle, and he changed the Johnny Storm character to being portrayed by a black actor, in order to better show how families in real life have changed; he is of mixed heritage himself. The explanation for Sue being white is that she is adopted. The way they receive their powers is a little different, too. Here, they travel to an alternate universe and the alien energies are what are responsible for giving them their super powers. Miles plays Reed Richards, Kate is Susan Storm, Michael is Johnny Storm and Jamie is Ben Grimm. Toby plays Victor Von Doom, who starts out as a co-worker but becomes their mortal enemy, Doctor Doom, before you know it. The movie starts with the childhood accomplishments in teleportation that Miles has achieved, which catches the eye of a big scientific corporation that snatches him up. At his new job, he develops his theories and that is how they wind up exploring the alternate universe. Doctor Doom has energy powers, too. Like I said, lots of changes. I can see how comic book purists might not care for this new version but FYI, they have already green lit a sequel for 2017, so someone has faith in it. There is not a scene after the end credits and Stan Lee does not make his usual cameo appearance. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.

58,alindsay-al,An awful comic book reboot,2,13 June 2016,"Obviously there has been a ton of controversy surrounding this film and I have finally seen it and yeah this film is really bad. The premise of the film sees a group of young students travel to an alternate dimension where they receive powers and have to stop there world from being destroyed. Miles teller plays reed Richards, Kate Mara plays Susan storm, Michael b Jordan plays johnny storm and Jamie bell plays Ben Grimm. Now these are all decent actors and for the most part they do an okay job with what there given but all of them are just so dull in this film and have no uniqueness to themselves. There isn't enough chemistry between the team and it actually doesn't make sense for Ben Grimm to travel with the team. Toby kebbell plays victor von doom in this film and I'm sorry but this is one of the worst villain portrayals of all time. He has absolutely nothing in common with his comic book counterpart and it comes across as insulting the way he is treated because it Is such a missed opportunity. I thought Dr Franklin storm was the most interesting character because he was like the only guy who was new to the franchise and he had a bit of depth trying to sort out everyone. The story is so basic and dull, it takes the majority of the movie just to set up these characters origins and they aren't even interesting. But the film just crumbles with the last act and it feels like a complete mess. The script has some really cheesy dialogue and it makes these characters more unappealing. The style of the film is really slow and dull, with the pacing of the film being way off. The thing h as never looked better then this film but he just is not used enough and it makes you realise how poor the pacing and tone of this film is.

The resulting film feels quite different from most Marvel properties and there's even a couple of effective sequences of bodily horror. Yet it does not work as a film-Miles Teller isn't particularly suited to Reed and he doesn't have chemistry with any other actor.

60,estebangonzalez10,One of the weakest super hero films of the decade or two.,4,8 August 2015,"""With every new discovery, there is risk, there is sacrifice... and there are consequences.""I was surprised that critics and audiences were ripping this film apart because in my mind there was no way the producers could go wrong with this young and talented cast, so I was prepared to enjoy and defend this movie. I had heard about the production problems, but something similar had happened with Ant-Man and that movie turned out to be surprisingly fun. At least the director, Josh Trank, had decided to stay on board for this film despite reports of disputes with his producers. His first feature film, Chronicle, was a very entertaining and unique low budget found-footage sci-fi movie, so I thought that with a bigger budget he could deliver an even better film. Evidently I was wrong because Fantastic Four is a gigantic mess. There were several concerns over the film being rushed so that Fox wouldn't lose the rights to the franchise and the movie definitely felt that way.Fantastic Four is basically an origin story that ends up being so long that by the time the villain shows up it feels more like a cameo than anything else. The final climax of the film is one of the worst I've seen in a superhero movie. I wouldn't mind this as much if the origin story would've been interesting, but none of these characters were engaging and the dialogue was quite terrible. Every one of them seemed to have daddy issues or some sort of cliché that characters in this genre usually have. Even Toby Kebbell who played Victor Domashev in this movie shared all the basic stereotypical traits foreshadowing who he would later become, Dr. Doom. Superhero films always tend to follow the same basic formula, but the successful ones manage to stand out for some unique quality, either benefiting from a great central performance, its funny upbeat light tone, or its spectacular action scenes. Fantastic Four uses the same formula, but doesn't do anything unique with it. There is no chemistry between the cast and the delivery of some of their lines are overly dramatic at times. There isn't a single strong performance here, there is no comedy whatsoever, and the action scenes (or should I say scene?) are underwhelming (especially if you compare it to other action Summer films like Mission Impossible and Mad Max). Unfortunately the film is a huge mess because it fails at setting up interesting characters and later rushes the final climatic action scene, completely changing gears on the slow and drawn out pacing that the movie had during its long introduction.The main character in this film is Reed Richards of course, so we follow him from childhood. He dreams of creating a device that can teleport people into an alternate place. In school he befriends a tough boy named Ben who becomes his assistant. Reed is a genius and working from his garage he comes up with an impressive mechanism in which he manages to teleport some objects, but in the process he leaves the entire town without electricity. Several years pass and now Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) are in a High School science fair showing off their invention. Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his daughter Sue (Kate Mara) are impressed with Reed so they offer him an opportunity to work with them in their advanced state of the art laboratory. Victor (Toby Kebbell) had been working on a very similar project, but had unsuccessfully been able to teleport the objects back so the two begin working together to make their dream a reality. Dr. Storm's other son, Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) also joins the project and when they succeed at teleporting a group of chimps to an alternate universe they decide its time for them to take the trip as well. Of course something goes terribly wrong and they each go through a unique physical transformation. They will have to learn to deal with their new acquired abilities, which the military takes a keen interest in, but Reed is focused on fixing them instead.Miles Teller had been on a roll with strong performances in films like Whiplash and The Spectacular Now. He was even great in his supporting role in Insurgent, a film I didn't like. But here he simply didn't have the charm to tackle this super hero. Perhaps the blame can be put on the screenwriters, but he couldn't do anything to make Reed an interesting character (not prior to his transformation nor after). Michael B. Jordan's career seemed to be taking off after his impressive performances in Chronicle and Fruitvale Station, but he wasn't able to do much with the small role that was given to him here. Reg. E. Cathey was perhaps the weakest link thanks to his overly dramatic delivery of each line with his deeply serious voice. Toby Kebbell came in a close second, but I really do have to blame the screenwriters here for making his character such a cliché. Villains have always been a problem in super hero films and it couldn't be more true than it is here. I've heard a couple defenses claiming that this is more of a sci-fi centering on human transformation (with comparisons to Cronenberg's The Fly), but that couldn't be further from the truth because when these heroes acquire their new abilities the film inexplicably leaps forward in time showing these characters already adapted to their transformation and coming to terms with it. All the psychological trauma is ignored in order to prepare for the final climactic action scene which was to put in nicely, underwhelming. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Fantastic Four
61,Fluke_Skywalker,"Fantastic? No, but not awful either",6,1 January 2016,"No film released in 2015 came with more baggage than Josh Trank's 'Fantastic Four'. Reports of erratic behavior from the director, rewrites of his script and the film ultimately being taken out of his hands and being heavily re-edited hung over the entire thing like a rain cloud. Critics hated it (%9 score on Rottentomatoes.com), audiences stayed away ($56 million dollar total gross in North America, though it did do better overseas) and it became one of the few real bombs of the comic book movie era. But is it really as bad as its reputation? Not quite.Make no mistake, 'Fantastic Four' is a flawed film. A very flawed film. The chaos behind the scenes is evident in the finished (or more accurately, unfinished) product. Trank was clearly going for something a bit more unconventional here. Something that actually might've worked and been fresh had he been allowed--or able--to see it through to completion. As it stands, the film feels jumbled, choppy and incomplete.

Anyone who likes the characters and superheros in general and is a fan of the series and is curious should give this a chance-odds are you won't be disappointed as long as your hopes aren't too high.

63,jimbo-53-186511,A pointless reboot which fails to improve on the original film in almost every manner possible,1,23 June 2016,"Based on a scientific project that Reed Richards (Miles Teller) has been developing (which can transfer matter from one dimension to another) the Fantastic Four use themselves as Guinea Pigs in order to transfer themselves to another dimension (in the belief that there is something in this other worldly dimension that will benefit their own planet). However, something goes wrong for our foursome during the transportation process and they end up with drastic physical transformations (some which are much more noticeable than others). Worse still, they tried and failed to save Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and leave him behind believing him to be dead. Later on, a team go back to the other dimension and discover that Victor is still alive and bring him back to Earth in order to assess his condition. But Victor has no intention of staying on Earth and is determined to create a new world in this other dimension and will stop at nothing to achieve his objective. Victor has also suffered a physical transformation, but he has become much stronger and more powerful than his former friends and the Fantastic Four find that they must work together to try to stop him from carrying out his evil plans.The film opens up with some promise whereby we're given an insight into how our illustrious foursome ended up becoming the formidable team that we saw in the earlier films. Despite a fairly promising beginning though this reboot completely fails to bring about a lot of the magic that we witnessed in the 2005 version of this film.A big problem for me lay with the tone of the film; firstly it takes itself WAY too seriously and as a result it made the film quite boring to watch. When watching this it felt like I was watching a science documentary (with all its wordy geeky exposition) rather than what should be a fun comic book type movie. This brings me on to my next point 'What fun'? In the 2005 film (and the 2007 film as well) there was much more in the way of camaraderie between the cast making the film much more fun to watch. As a villain Von Doom isn't particularly well-developed here and I felt his motivations for world-domination were a little sketchy here - I criticised Von Doom's motivations in the original film, but compared to his motivations here they now seem more plausible in retrospect.I appreciate that this is a reboot and therefore the filmmaker's are trying to put their own stamp on things (presumably that explains why Johnny Storm is black in this film and also explains why their powers have been attained in a different manner to the original film). The problem with this reboot is that they've failed to do anything to improve on the original film; the story isn't as interesting, the characters are much weaker and are poorly developed, there is no real exploration of their super powers (this was a big thing in the previous films and made sense as they were a big life-changing aspect for the foursome), but here they just kind of have the super powers and then that's it - off to destroy Victor Von Doom. The only real super power that is explored is that of The Thing and even that super power is exploited in a rather lame way.The cast are another big problem with this film as they totally failed to engage with me (as well as each other); Miles Teller is really bland as Reed Richards (even more bland than Ioan Gruffudd was in the original films) which is surprising as he put in a very good performance in Whiplash 2 years ago. Kate Mara is very pretty, but she's terrible in this film (again probably worse than Alba was in the original films). Michael B Jordan tries his best as Johnny Storm, but he lacks the charisma that Evans brought to the role in the original films and as a result suffers badly in comparison. The Thing for me is probably the best character in the film, but he lacks the touching back story that we lay witness to in the original film and again suffers from not being developed sufficiently enough to make me really care about him here.The ending is also poor and lacks any kind of intensity and tension and has the Fantastic Four doing 'the obvious' to wrap the film up.All in all it's a very disappointing film where the serious tone is perhaps a bigger enemy to the film than Doctor Doom. It's big and bloated, but it's also boring, and lacking in both fun and imagination. I'd recommend giving it a wide berth.",Fantastic Four

65,aharmas,Not Fantastic But Not Atrocious,6,22 August 2015,"It's still a mystery the extremely negative reaction people have expressed toward this latest incarnation of the classic ""Fantastic Four"". It's certainly not the worst or the best, and it's way better than some of the highly praised films in either action or drama categories. At best, it's a hybrid, trying to give the background store more weight. At worst, it suffers from a lack of editing its script plus the fact that it seems to lose steam in the final scenes.This adaptation takes us back to the very early days of a couple of the quartet. We are supposed to understand the drive and intelligence of the main scientist and his best friend. We get a bit of background about the rebellious Johnny Storm and his sister's character is truly underdeveloped to the point one can't help ignoring or disliking her.I thought it was interesting to get more information on who these people are, and I liked to see the fact that Van Doom was a bit more than just a sketch. The first half of the film is really good, though I am able to see that audiences used to three-second flash editing might have a problem concentrating. It's not that these scenes are slow or deep. They are not typical comic book fare.There are problems with the way the other dimension is shown, nothing more than a valley of shadows with pretty much nothing worth mentioning. Even the threatening green rivers of energy are boring. How can we feel threatened by such geological fare? I found more drama in the chemistry between Teller and the actor playing Doom. Are these two colleagues or just fighting suitors for Susan? Even the matter of Doom being opposed to what the suits expect from him makes it clear why he goes ""mad"" and wants to destroy the world in the final scenes. It's a strong idea that is never given enough weight, and the final confrontation is indeed terribly short.Many will find the lack of humor in the film a problem because that has been a trademark from the early animation series to the last two live action entries. This time everyone is so serious and intelligent that they forgot to have a good time or enjoy each other's companies. We also notice how the bad guys are just not much than stereotypes, and everyone knows how much a good/bad villain brings to the conflict.Still, one can find some entertainment here. There has been talk about pressures from the studio and non-conformity by a few of the involved parties, and it's obvious because the film loses momentum as it nears the end. The involved parties don't seem to be happy at times, and there's some direction and tone missing. In the middle of all of this, there are hints that we could have a better sequel. Look at the original ""Star Trek"" movies. The first one was directed by Robert Wise, and we were surprised by how empty and bloated it felt at the same time. Yet, the second entry is one of the best films of the series. Who says that maybe the ""Fantastic Four"" haven't food their footing yet?",Fantastic Four
66,peterp-450-298716,A captivating first part (most will say this was the boring part) but the end wasn't fantastic,5,29 January 2016,"""Where'd the rocks come from? From the same place the car went to. Where is that? I don't know yet.""During my youth I spent many hours next door with the neighbor boy. Not just for having fun or horsing around, but also because in their veranda there was a disused closet with sliding doors where you could always find some old comics lying around. I suppose these were from the older brother who was a real comic fan. Many hours I spent sitting in front of that closet, reading them all. Comics like ""Archie the man of steel"", DC comics and of course Marvel. My favorite was ""The Fantastic Four"". This series I found extremely fascinating and that because it was a collective, consisting of several superheroes with different super powers. They formed a close-knit family and their identity was known to the population so these heroes had a rather family character. Actually, they were a little bit the forerunners of ""The Avengers"" and the figure of ""The Hulk"" resembled that of Ben.Unfortunately, this film is labeled as an unnecessary and worthless reboot. I partially agree with that. The only thing is that I can't judge whether this is an unnecessary reboot or not. I've never seen the previous films made in 1994 and 2005. Saying this is a failure or total disaster though, is something I don't fully agree with. A big part of the film I enjoyed watching and personally I thought it was interesting enough. The introduction of the various members of the unprecedented four was extremely captivating. The beginning showed a young Reed Richards (Judge Owen). A genius who seemed to come from Mars, according to some of his classmates, and who's building a futuristic machine in the garage. A missing component he finds on a junkyard where he bumps into young Ben Grimm (Evan Hannemann). The experiment proves to be a success and things can be materialized to an unknown destination and brought back again. Years later Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) attend a science fair, where they attract the attention of Dr. Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his daughter Sue (Kate Mara). And before they know it, they are in a sophisticated lab rebuilding their invention on a large scale.This introduction was the most successful part for me. It felt like an adventure film in which a boy pursues the realization of a dream. In an amateurish and childish way, the prototype of something big is made out of junk (a bit like in ""Project Almanac""). Also the introduction to the various members who become part of ""The Fantastic Four"" in the Baxter Foundation, made this film different of other superhero movies. Mostly this part is kept short so they can move on to the action part immediately. The moment things start going wrong with the four noticing something happened to their bodies after they've jumped to the other dimension (while being drunk), it's still interesting enough. You witness how each of them discover their new capacities. But when the action-packed part of the film starts, it's no longer fantastic. It turns into an uninspired, quickly made up heroes-movie. As if they suddenly realized that stuff should be in it too. The visuals of the other dimension are still enjoyable, but the final stage feels rather flat and not very original. And certainly because nowadays as a moviegoer, you're buried under tons of superhero-movies.Ultimately, this film emphasizes the formation of and relationships between the members of ""The Fantastic Four"". The superhero action that you ultimately expect, is fairly limited. A film that takes 90 minutes, with only a demonstration of superpowers and a final clash of fifteen minutes, can hardly be seen as a superhero movie. Perhaps this change was welcome anyway, after all the Marvel releases in recent years. The fatigue comes into play when it's about this genre. Perhaps the final part of the movie wasn't so great, but it wasn't painfully bad either. And now I'll just wait for ""Deadpool"" .... More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Fantastic Four

Unconvincing pseudo- science, uncharismatic actors, boring story... In my opinion, the CGI- made Thing is the worst in all live action ""Fantastic 4"" movies (he looks like an ent from Tolkien's Middle Earth), including the first one, from the 90's, which is always considered (exaggeratedly) as one of the worst superhero movies ever made. Indeed, if you wanna know, in spite of its much higher budget, this movie is worse than that one, which has been made with no real intention to be released. It was also ridiculous to put Susan Storm as a Kosovar adopted girl just to justify that she is the sister of a black Johnny Storm. Besides that, is it serious that nobody talked about Victor Von Doom since the accident until he reappeared?!",Fantastic Four
70,Seraphion,Very disappointing,4,9 August 2015,"Since kids, Reed Richards have always been the scientist, thinking his ideas way out of the minds of others. His best friend Ben always helps him, although he doesn't have Reed's brightness. In a science fair Red gets a scholarship offer at Baxter for his machine which cracked inter- dimensional travel. There Reed meets Sue Storm, the adopted daughter of scientist Franklin Storm. Franklin is obsessed with the inter- dimensional travel project, entrusting his vision to young kids like Reed, Sue and Victor von Doom who was the pioneer in the field until Reed figured out what's missing from his formula. Also joining them is Johnny Storm, Franklin's son. After a series of tests, it's determined that I's doable for humans to do the inter-dimensional travel, but the leaders at Baxter decides to bring in NASA and hold the thing. Victor and Reed decides that it's the fruit of their labor and dreams thus it's their right to go travel first. Reed phones Ben to join them and they with Victor and Johnny go.In the other dimension they find a pool of oozing energy. They go to investigate it and the pool comes to life and devours them. Victor gets swallowed and they can't save him. They all go back to the pod. But it's jammed so Sue helps them from our side. Just as Sue overrides, Ben's capsule door opens and he gets slammed by rocks. Johnny's capsule windows breaks and he's engulfed in flames. The pod returns home creating a blackout and wrecks the lab. Reed's legs get trapped under rubbles. As he crawls to find Ben he finds his legs stretched. The government detains them. They are promised a cure as the government searches for it but for the mean time they're asked to do assignments. Apparently Sue also gets some powers through the electric shock on the pods's return. Reed escapes his cell. Ben, Sue and Johnny trains and hone their powers, believing Reed abandoned them. A year later Ben is successful in military missions and Johnny is about to be sent those missions too, but Sue refuses to be a tool. Franklin talks Sue into tracking Reed, leading to his arrest by Ben.Franklin talks Reed into helping complete the second portal to get the cure from the other side. They travel back to the other side and find Victor surviving with metal covering his body, slumping and passing out. The mission brings him back. But Victor wakes up and lays waste to the place. He uses the pod to travel back to the other dimension and creates a vortex through the pod that sucks everything to the other dimension. He easily subdues Reed, Ben Sue and Johnny on their own. But Reed gains a chance and throws Victor away for a while. They then unite and throw Victor at the vortex, destroying it at the same time. As the vortex closes they fly out of the other dimension. The story seems interesting at first, of how the scientists are being pictured as youngsters now. But then everything starts to fall apart since development. The story anchored it's start point quite nicely at Reed's childhood, but it took too long in dwelling in that time period. Further, that long dwelling wasn't used properly to balance and develop all the characters, especially Ben who was already there with Reed. Sue and Johnny seems limping empty since the movie is all about Reed. Even the antagonist Victor isn't really developed well, particularly on the reasoning of his behaviors.As a superhero movie, this movie took too long before the audience can see any real action. I noted tat it took about 36 minutes until the first suspenseful sequence happen. All the stuff before minute thirty- sixth was just a load of build-up that seemed overdone yet imbalanced. Yet when it's there, the action seemed very much scarce indeed. The parts of Ben as a military operator, Reed's fight avoid capture, even Johnny and Sue's training should have been emphasized better and given more screen time. Instead the movie enjoyed in keeping to the dialogs.The acting overall seemed just at a standard with the young cast members. Miles Teller was nicely aware of the overwhelming focus on his character and he played his parts adequately enough. Although we can still see that it's quite a struggle for him to switch from his earlier characters. Kate Mara also did okay for her parts. It's too bad that her role didn't have a deserving portion of the movie. Michael B. Jordan was quite flat here due to being quite polarized on his character. He over done things both on the serious and the joking parts. Jamie Bell is really under utilized, both as Ben and as The Thing, as he also didn't get enough exposure.I agree with those who score Fantastic Four (2015) a 4 out of 10 score. A recommendation is instead a negative one from me. Don't go see this in the cinemas, it's not worth your money. It's quite bad as an entertainment due to taking too long to build up, and also the action lacks the epic factor a superhero movie requires.",Fantastic Four
71,rgkarim,Not So Fantastic Four,4,8 August 2015,"Seems like superhero movies are taking over the theaters this year, as we get our third tale of heroic comic book characters in the span of three months. After Marvel's last adventure about three weeks ago, I was hoping for the same type of magic in the latest retelling of the Fantastic Four. The trailers didn't paint a pretty picture, but hope still remained that Marvel had gotten the formula right this time. What was the verdict? As always, please read on to find out.I guess I should start out with the truth, this movie was not that good, and perhaps one of the weaker superhero movies in a while. Let's start with the story. The beginning of the film wasn't too bad, a fun and slightly humorous introduction to our protagonists. The background story was realistic, and had some good team building moments, though it was a bit dull. Then comes the incident. It's been a while since I reviewed the Fantastic Four lore, but this movie centers on the theme of our team set on traversing across the space- time continuum to an alternate dimension. And like always, a sudden, and very conventional set of circumstances happen that leads our team to developing powers. Now I'm not caught up on the dimension thing, but the delivery was horrible as the circumstances suddenly just happen. This hasty mess of loud noises and bright flashes, led to a rapid, chaotic, and rather cheesy transition into their familiar forms. And from there it only got worse, the plot continued to spiral downward as a hasty culmination of shallow plots. To me it seemed like they couldn't settle on where to take the story, and mashed things together to cover their bases and give an excuse for action. It didn't work, the details were all in a frenzy and shallower than a kiddie pool and incredibly disappointing. No training, no coming to grip with powers, not even a legitimate introduction to the villain, only a boring mess of half-hearted scenes whose only use was to show off the special effects.Speaking of special effects, Fantastic Four has some decent CGI work, though nowhere near the best. Our groups powers were nicely animated, each well edited into the real time acting to give a smooth transition from actor to super actor. In particular, the Thing looked much better from the earlier counterpart in the fact that he didn't look like a latex covered linebacker, though he didn't look much better. And Reed Richard's stretch power was a little stiff and exaggerated, but surprisingly some of the best action. Speaking of action, this movie was not that good in the action department either. Sure the animation for the powers was decent, but the action was just as disorganized as the story. Our heroes primarily used their powers in quick shots, often a quick sequence to show the ""struggles"" of training or mindlessly destroying some military equipment. When the epic finale hit, there was not much improvement, with a little strategy amidst the flashy display of computer generated powers. A shame they didn't study the work of previous Marvel movies that were successful.Acting wise the movie isn't that good either, most of the time our group lacks any emotion in their dialogue and when they finally do get emotional they go overboard. Most of it is shouting, or very sad attempts at crying, that tried to show they had a side outside of their intellectual side. Surprisingly the emotion came when they were trying to reason with everyone, which often calls for logic not emotion to be successful. Silly directors. And Doom's character, especially after the event, was very dry, monotone, and much different from the evil genius we have come to know. The best character for this reviewer , was the Dr. Storm (Reg. E. Cathey) who was the best balance of intellect and emotion in the movie, which wasn't hard to do. So what did I actually like from this movie? We start with the musical score, a nice symphony of instruments that helped add a little spark of life to this rather mundane movie. The generic tracks they designed have some emotional drive to them, and I'm always a fan of the scores that represent a new frontier to explore. The second aspect is that they did get the movie done in under two hours and minimized my suffering through this picture, though perhaps this could have been the factor that caused it to be rushed in the first place. Finally the lovely Kate Mara was a good component to this movie, her acting a little awkward at times, but her beauty as a blonde was nice to see on the big screen. Props have to go out to the costume department as well, whose costumes and makeup mostly brought the characters to life. Fantastic Four is a series that struggles to get a real life adaptation. I applaud the team for trying, but Marvel needs to go back to the drawing board for this series. If a sequel is in the works, they need to do some serious homework to right the wrongs they made. This reviewer cannot recommend seeing this installment, and encourages you to check out Antman instead. If you are looking for a movie this weekend, you need to lean towards the Gift or Shaun The Sheep instead, whose reviews are mostly positive. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 5.0 Movie Overall: 4.5",Fantastic Four

73,rannynm,Disappointing but Riveting First Half,3,10 August 2015,"This is a disappointing film that has a riveting first half but a rushed and forced second half. Four young minds create a machine that transports them into a alternate universe. Once they come back they have acquired unique powers that they need to control.The first half looked quite promising. The pace, character development and story are very engaging. The darker direction they take with the story makes it enjoyable. My favorite scene is when the four discover their abilities. There is a sense of fear, tragedy and betrayal with the characters. It starts out as another successful origin story, then it feels as if the editors pressed the fast-foreword button once it starts to get interesting. The second half feels as if it is a long sneak peek for the next Fantastic Four film. It has a great head start but it left me wanting more in a negative way. There is enough four, but it lacks ""fantastic."" The updated special effects are one of the redeeming qualities of this film. The presentation of each power is stunning. The impressive design of Ben Grimm/The Thing (Jamie Bell) and the fluent stretching effects of Mister Fantastic give this film an updated edge. At first there is a connection among the characters; both with each other and the audience. The actors pull this off seamlessly and you are sincerely captivated with their goals and struggles. However, they suffer during the second half as all their hard work is painfully rushed. My favorite character is Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic (Miles Teller). Richards is one of the people who help build the machine. He ends up getting the ability of an elastic body which means he can stretch any part of his anatomy. Miles Teller has been on a roll with his career and for good reasons. He's a talented actor who dives deeply into the characters he plays. This part is no exception.The moral of the film, though a bit forced, reminds me of Abraham Lincoln's quote, ""A house dived against itself cannot stand."" The four heroes face Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and attack him individually. Soon they realize, that together, they are stronger.I give this film 3 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 10 through 18-year-olds. There's some dark material and language that younger audiences may not be able to handle. This film has some saving aspects but sadly, they do not recover the whole film.

They spend way too much on establishing nothing, making weird changes to the Storms and Doom, and giving Richards the Spiderman treatment: his thing is that he's literally in the top ten smartest Terrans, but it's more important that he's young.They actually giving us a more interesting (not hard) origin story, and then went right back to (explicitive deleted) it up again, changing Sue's powers so they don't need the Fantastic Four flying car, and turning them into a military asset instead of a scientific research team. They even took Ben's mechanic abilities away.They also dehumanize Doom, completing changing who he is, his powers, his motivations, and even his classic look: which cosplayers have shown works in real life, they just had to tweak it.I'll maintain, pre-disney, there hasn't been a good F4 movie. Eventually we'll see them get introduced to the MCU in some movie, they'll probably buy Stark Tower because the MCU is too broken to have two special towers at the same time.",Fantastic Four
75,Rob_Taylor,Expect the worst and you will be pleasantly surprised,7,25 August 2015,"So, with all the negativity and hatred surrounding this project, I went into it expecting to see a laughable travesty of a movie.You can imagine my surprise then, when I found that not only was it not a horrible movie, but that it was actually quite reasonably enjoyable.I won't try to pretend that it is the best of the Marvel efforts of recent years - I still think Iron Man holds that title - but neither is it the dull snore-fest that was Age of Ultron.It was also pleasant to find a movie that was complete in 90 minutes and not dragged out to tedium inducing lengths. Shorter can be better, in some instances.Do I prefer this outing to the 2005 version? Well, no, to be honest. Though that had plenty of faults, there was more interaction between the characters than here. However, here, in what is essentially an origin story, they had to set the scene. Sure, we all know who the Fantastic Four are. They really need no introduction, but that isn't how franchises are made.The complaints about lack of action just highlight how sad and limited what passes for a good action movie these days is expected to be. I like build-up. I like character development. Non-stop action, for me, is a big turn off. So I appreciated the more measured approach of F4. As I said in my Ultron review, all action movies quickly become tedious to endure, which is probably why I rated this movie higher than Ultron.So I think Trank did a passable job with this film. Certainly he is not deserving of the vitriol being spewed his way at the moment. It is easy to jump on the hate wagon, but less easy to get off. If this is the kind of movie that ruins a man's career, then it says something more about mob mentality than it does about his ability to direct.SUMMARY: Absolutely nowhere near as bad as it has been made out to be. Quite entertaining, in fact. Just as you shouldn't believe all the hype surrounding movies these days, so you should take with a large handful of salt, the vilification of movies. Ultimately, make your own minds up and don't follow the herd.",Fantastic Four
76,Matt_Layden,Embarrassing For All Involved.,4,4 May 2016,"I didn't actually expect this to be as bad as everyone was saying, but this 100 minute so-called superhero film is full of generic ideas, bad decisions from the actors, director and writer and the biggest sin, is utterly boring. Reed Richards is brilliant and cracks the code on how to travel between dimensions. Along with some other people he goes to another planet and boom, gets super powers. he can stretch, she can turn invisible, the brother can flame on and the friend is a rock. Someone else went too, he becomes bad because they left him behind. I decided to half ass my write up on the plot because the filmmakers choose to half ass it in making this film. The only interesting aspect feels like it was all left on the cutting room floor. Glossed over by a stupid One Year Later title card. They come back and have these powers, the government instantly experiments on them. There could have been some Cronenberg-esque sequence here and I believe that was Trank's intention. Yet it's all left aside (stuido interference he claims) to jump ahead to the anti-climatic third act that had me playing Eurche on my phone. All the interesting aspects of the film are completely passed over. What was the government doing to these people over the course of the year? What was Richards doing while on the run? The relationship between the Fantastic Four is so utterly paper thin that I felt insulted at times. People know from the source material or even the original films that Johnny Storm aka The Human Torch likes the poke fun at The Thing. This never happens in the film until the last 5 seconds and it comes out of nowhere. It feels like some sort of forced hostile character assassination attempt. Jordan is given very little dialogue, Jamie Bell as well. These two might have a combined screen time of 30 minutes? I'm not sure but it feels like these two are hardly in the film. Zero chemistry between Mara and Teller with cringe-worthy dialogue and acting choices. Teller honestly feels like he's reading off cue cards off camera. He has zero charisma and clearly did this for a quick buck. Kebbell as Dr. Doom is embarrassing. Forced ""tension"", if you can call it that, between him and others is laughable. He's suppose to be brilliant, but we have no picture of that, just his arrogance. The continuity, my god, this could rival The Evil Dead for how hilarious it is. Teller with facial hair in one scene, then clean shaven the next. Mara with an obvious blonde wig that makes it look like a Targaryen in one scene then a normal person the next. These types of inconsistencies you would find in b-movies, not a Hollywood production of a known superhero franchise. The studio has killed their new reboot here. They wanted something out there before the rights reverted back to Marvel and they blew it. This is a mess. Well, congratulations on keeping these characters under your studio for a few more years, it seems like wasted money.",Fantastic Four

I mean I like the dark tone being used in films at the best of times (& don't get me wrong 'Dark' is my middle name) but in this film it bittered the hell out of it & was just not fun to watch! I mean the dark tone just doesn't suit this film at all! It would be like adding a darker tone to Avengers Assemble! This is an action film not a horror film! Damn!I also felt the film lacked the elements which made a good super hero film & of course the original 2005 version! That was saving lives, humour, good story-line & interaction with the real world! This film was very cut off from all those things & made living in a mental asylum seem more enjoyable! That's how dull this crap was! It was lifeless & gloomy!The story-line of the film was basic & dragged on! The film was just slow, boring torture & not fun, literally! The characters were flat, dull & completely unlikable. They didn't do anything humorous in or with their powers like the 2005 original did pretty much. The remake had no interacting with real world & no life saving which I think let this film down badly aside from the darker tone being added which I mentioned above was the main downfall of this film! Along with the film dragging on too much & the group to not discover their powers naturally unlike being locked away in a facility & the film ending there in a planet unlike in the real world like the 2005 film did! It was just complete sh!te to be honest!It seems like in this day & age whenever a Marvel film gets made their made only for 2 reasons 1. To boast the effects especially the CGI ones, which means sacrificing the interaction with the real world like saving peoples lives & their powers going haywire in funny humorous way like the 2005 film did & 2. Just to please the fans of the Sci- Fi films as a whole because they like fantasy films which are completely separated from the world! It annoys me quite abit how they just can't make them like they used to!The film overall was just dull & depressing & had no life in it! The film was cut off, isolated & gloomy just like that of a nerd who locks himself in his room away from reality! Not to mention how nearly all the elements & things which made the 2005 Fantastic 4 film way more superior to this pile of crap remake were absent!

79,WeAreLive,It is not as bad as every one says it is,7,24 October 2017,"Okay, when this movie released in the cinema at Star City me and my dad went to see this movie together and we both loved it. It had good special effects and acting. However, Jamie Bell was good as Ben Grimm but was a miscast as The Thing whereas Micheal B Jordan was a miscast as both Johnny Storm and the human torch. But at least Sue Storm was more cute and hotter in this movie than the previous incarnation.But really bugs me is in this version Ben Grimm, Reed Richards, Johnny Storm and Victor Van Doom went into space and got effected with Victor left behind. But Sue got affected when the spaceship landed and created a shock wave and she fainted despite the fact she never went with them. But it was a very awesome movie but not the same as the previous incarnation and don't let these bad reviews that are written by comic book nerds, fanboys and fangirls stop you from watching this film.",Fantastic Four
80,brando647,I Really Want to See Josh Trank's Original Vision for the Film,4,18 July 2016,"Oh, man. The Fantastic Four just can't catch a break. First there was the legendary unreleased Roger Corman film hastily thrown together to retain the comic's rights for the studio. Then there were the two regrettable Tim Story films. Now we've got director Josh Trank's vision, and I really hate to say this but those Tim Story movies were somehow more entertaining. I can't remember the last time I've followed a production as problematic and miserable as that of 2015's FANTASTIC FOUR. Sadly, the filmmakers weren't able to pull the nose up on this one before dumping it into theaters with a gut-wrenching score of 9% on Rotten Tomatoes. I knew the news wasn't good with this one, but I did my best to sit down and watch it with an open mind. I want to say I might've even enjoyed it just a tad the first time I watched it but, no, a second viewing rubbed any positive vibes right out. This movie is just depressing. What's it about this time around? The origins of the Fantastic Four. Again. Though slightly different. Reed Richards (Miles Teller, whom I'm sure regrets this whole ordeal following his critical acclaim in WHIPLASH) is a high school genius who has been working with his longtime friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) in perfecting a teleportation device. His project earns some attention at the school science fair from Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his daughter Sue (Kate Mara). Storm realizes that Reed hasn't achieved teleportation but instead inter-dimensional travel, and he brings him aboard his government-funded project where they're developing the same technology. Reed works with Sue, her hot-headed brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordon), and moody young genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) to complete a functioning inter-dimensional pod. When the pod is complete and the government moves in to take control, Reed leads a rushed (drunken?) expedition to another dimension, calling in his best bud Ben to join them. One thing leads to another, there's a massive unexplained energy surge and there you go: the Fantastic Four. You surely know them by now.I wanted so badly for this movie to be good. I really dig Josh Trank's CHRONICLE and, while I was a little annoyed at the Fantastic Four being cast so young, I figured this was in Trank's wheelhouse and he'd knock it out of the park. Maybe he would have if the studio hadn't gotten so involved. I don't know. All I know is that the finished product is gloomy, dull, and a real wasted chance. Let's start with the gloom. Everyone in this movie is miserable. Reed is probably the most bright-eyed and hopeful of them all at the start of the movie but that all changes once he leads his mission to the mystery planet. Doom is left for dead and his friends have all developed these life-altering powers, and Reed takes it pretty heavily. Ben Grimm has harbored resentment for his new rocky condition as the Thing in all incarnations of the character but here he's just a big mopey monster. He even turns his back on Reed, his best friend, when Reed escapes from the government facility where they'd been quarantined on return. He spends a good chunk of the movie slouching around with a frown and going on missions for the United States to use his new physique to slaughter enemy soldiers. Sue just seemed to hate everyone from the start and prefers to work alone, listening to music in her earbuds whilesearching for patterns in things? I guess that's her specialty. Johnny isn't so much depressed as he is rebellious, acting out against his father and throwing a fit when he's assigned to work on the pod device as punishment for street racing. Just as with the Human Torch from previous movies, he's also the only character to embrace his new powers. Finally, there's Doom. He's just an angry loner, aggravated that he has to work with anyone on his big project. Everyone sort of becomes friendly over the course of the project but not by much. It's still just a bunch of moody not-quite-teenagers and none of them ever really seem to click.Well, the characters are hardly likable. And the plot? Barely exists. It's not until almost an hour into this movie that pod is complete and we can move on to the meat of the film. We wait so long for the Fantastic Four and for what? I swear, nothing interesting happens in that first hour. It's all character establishment (introducing us to each character's individual brand of moodiness). Once it finally kicks in, I get a little hopeful. The reveals for each character's power is pretty cool. As with the tone of the movie, it's a pretty dark sequence. These kids are pulled from the rubble of the pod, warped and nearly dead. When they awake in quarantine, they're terrified and confused. If there's anything positive of note in this whole movie, it's this sequence right here. It's far from fitting with the light-hearted tone we expect from the Fantastic Four, but I liked it. Then the second half of the movie is rebuilding the pod for the government, the discovery of Doom alive on the mystery planet, and the big bombastic battle sequence. It's slightly interesting, visually, but not enough to make it enjoyable. Doom's motivation seems purely to be vengeance for vengeance's sake. I'm not entirely sure how long he was alone on that planet or how he physically survived (I believe he made mention that the planet kept him alive, whatever that means), but now he's determined to draw Earth's energy across the dimensional barrier for whatever reason. It just gives the Fantastic Four a chance to use their powers and beat him as a team. But it's hard to find the will to care about these gloomy characters. Sorry, Fantastic Four. Better luck next time, I guess.",Fantastic Four
81,moviexclusive,An empty plot and nonexistent character development make this reboot of Marvel's iconic superhero quartet a pointless exercise in ignominy,4,6 August 2015,"Just because you can do it doesn't mean that you should – and this wholly unnecessary and woefully terrible reboot of Marvel's most famous superteam is proof of that axiom. Say what you may about Tim Story's earlier cinematic adaptations, but as generic and middling as they were, they were at the very least entertaining. Unfortunately, the same cannot even be said of Josh Trank's back-to- basics origin story, which plays like a humourless retread of his debut film 'Chronicle' but on a bigger budget – and lest there be any doubt, it is far, far from fantastic.Not that it doesn't demonstrate such promise; the first act which establishes the friendship between the visionary Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his tough-guy longtime best pal Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as well as the team dynamics between Reed and the other members of his research team – the equally brilliant Sue (Kate Mara), her hot- headed younger brother Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), and malcontent genius Victor Von Doom (Toby Kibbell) – capably lay the foundation for what could have been a character-driven drama based on their clashing personalities. Indeed, after the boys sans Sue decide on a whim following a night of intoxication to put their teleporting machine to the test, how they respond to their newfound super-powers individually and as a team should be an organic evolution from how they were before.Alas, Trank, who co-wrote the screenplay with 'X-Men' veteran Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, doesn't quite know where to go from there. Rather than setting them on a course that would follow the perennial 'X-Men' theme of inclusiveness versus insularity against the rest of society, our teenage super-heroes are pretty much seen only in an isolated military facility where they are trained and from which they are deployed on covert operations overseas. While Johnny relishes the opportunity to be different, powerful and useful for once in his life, Sue and Ben are not quite so sanguine and participate insofar as there remains a possibility that the Government's research on them would yield some way of reversing their abnormalities. In the meantime, Reed has vanished off the grid, while Victor is presumed dead on the planet they had landed up on in the other dimension.One senses a conscious decision on the part of Trank to eschew the usual superheroics seen in the recent profusion of Marvel and to a lesser extent DC comic book adaptations, but the middle act drags precisely because Trank never quite finds a compelling substitute. Johnny's potential conflict with Sue and Ben over the Government's exploitation of their super-powers never amounts to anything more than a playground squabble. The estrangement between Johnny and his father (Reg E. Cathey), whose Baxter Institute had overseen the ill- fated project, is under-cooked. And last but not least, Reed's guilt over his teammates' fates as well as his strained friendship with Ben seem to vanish as quickly as he is apprehended and brought back to the facility to aid them in version 2.0 of the same project.Trank's intention of emphasising the tension within the quartet is evident and admirable, but is ultimately undone by a script that doesn't develop it in any substantive manner. Worse still, it leaves an audience looking for visual spectacle severely wanting, that not even a very busy third act manages to salvage. Doom makes an unsurprising return here as their common enemy, driven by a fusion of body and alien matter to cause global destruction and around whose defeat to ensure the survival of planet Earth becomes a rallying call for the team to unite despite their differences. It is one of the dullest and most unexciting finales we've seen in a Marvel movie, not least for the fact that it doesn't know how to collectively bring together their superpowers except in a tag-team fashion to distract their opponent. It is also on the whole one of the ugliest comic book movies we've ever seen. The planet from which the quartet gain their powers is a barren rocky wasteland that has no character or distinction whatsoever, shrouded perpetually with thick grey clouds and given the even more nondescript name of 'Zero'. The energy that gives them their abilities appears as some slimy green goo that belongs entirely in a C-grade Syfy TV movie, while their powers – whether Reed's rubber limbs or Sue's telekinesis or Johnny's pyrotechnics or Ben's rock-covered body – look equally cheesy. It is no wonder too that the eventual showdown, which takes place almost entirely on the planet surface of 'Zero', doesn't play out any much better against such a bland setting, coming off even worse than any of the action scenes in its predecessors.And certainly, this reboot is in no way better than Tim Story's earlier adaptations, no matter of its ambition of being a darker and more character-driven superhero piece. 'Chronicle' may have been a perfect calling card for Trank, but 'Fantastic Four' shows a young, inexperienced director completely out of his depth, absolutely justifying the advance bad buzz it had spent months battling. It is utterly embarrassing that a film about Marvel's most enduring creations is no better than a live-action 'Power Rangers' movie, but that's exactly the ignominy that this misconceived and badly executed excuse of a superhero movie has wrought.As is typical with such origin stories, this one ends with the quartet 'stumbling' on their title as they admire their new home in Central City and reflecting on how far they have come. Ben aka the Thing describes their journey as ""fantastic""; we're not entirely sure anyone of their audience shares the same sentiment.",Fantastic Four
82,quincytheodore,"Generic, predictable and criminally boring",3,12 August 2015,"There have been hundreds of negative reviews already, but I feel compelled to contribute to society by adding one more. Fantastic Four is a sloppy reboot that doesn't offer anything new, or anything at all. It's a literal origin story we don't need, and not even as enjoyable as the previous rendition with Jessica Alba and Chris Evans, which speaks volume of how terrible it is.In a more youthful take, Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and friends are involved in making a dimensional teleporter. It will then, unsurprisingly, fail catastrophically and turning them into the titular heroes. The story is excruciatingly boring, it would probably not last as weekend TV show. Devoid of any novelty or humor, it's an expected dull endeavor.The cast is full or promising actors, each of them is capable of starring as leading role, and they have, but here they are far from convincing as heroes. Not only that the chemistry is dreary at best, more often they engage in a display of awkward interactions than looking like a fully functioning team. Granted, it's an origin story, but at least the previous team looks believable as team.Pacing is a series of prolonged events that we already know. It doesn't take comic fans to know these things, yet the movie tries so hard to sell novelty it doesn't have with soundtracks and timid dramatic moments while audiences yawn witnessing plot developments from 90s. Some of the actions scenes, from the total of ten minutes, are choppy and looks outdated.It even tries to shoehorn incomplete villain, lame attempt on humor and force message on how we destroy the planet. When superhero, or action movies in general, have offered much superior quality, Fantastic Four is not worth your money or time. It will eventually be teleported to another dimension where we occasionally gaze upon to reflect past mistake.",Fantastic Four

This is rather dark, without charm or humor and totally ruins one of the greatest villains of Marvel comics. sure, the special effects are decent and there is potential for a somewhat good film here or there but the stereotypes and lack of an intriguing plot entirely ruin any chance of a redeeming movie experience. Very disappointing.",Fantastic Four
85,Screen_Blitz,This is probably Marvel Comics' worst film,2,10 August 2015,"Being a fan of superhero flicks based on the ever-popular Marvel comics, I went into this with fairly average, if not high expectations. These movies have always ended up being some of the biggest and most entertaining films during the summers, often leading to major box office numbers. Unfortunately, this is not the case with this disastrous reboot of the Fantastic Four franchise which has suffered an unfair amount of abuse in the last ten years, beginning with Tim Story's outing in 2005 and later its sequel two years later; both of which failed to commit justice to the Fantastic Four league. This reboot directed by Josh Trank, who made the surprisingly entertaining hit 'Chronicle' not flounders to improve upon the previous outings, it does worse. This film follows Reed Richards (played by Miles Teller), Sue Storm (played by Kate Mara), her rebellious step-brother Johnny Storm (played by Michael B. Jordan), and Ben Grimm (played by Jamie Bell), a group of young outsiders at a research lab working a giant teleporter known as the Quantum Gate. When one of their experiments goes awry and their colleague Victor Von Doom (played by Toby Kebell) is killed, they obtain mysterious superhuman abilities that they must learn. Soon, they discover Victor von Doom is back from the dead and has become a murderous villain a.k.a Doctor Doom, with an intention on destroying the world, for some unknown reason. The team of now-superheroes become the world's last line of defense.What is wrong this film? The real challenge here is pointing out anything in this movie to consider redeeming qualities. First off, the story is not lousy in writing, but suffers from a significantly awkward pace. The storyline covers the whole origin story of how the four main characters became who they are, and it spends an unnecessary amount of time, over half of the movie to be more specific, focusing on needless exposition we already seen in the previous entries. It makes you wonder if Fox demanded extensive cuts from the final product (which wouldn't surprise me). With all that time wasted, it takes absolutely no time to develop the characters. Reed Richards becomes Mr. Fantastic, Johnny Storm becomes the Human Torch, Sue Storm becomes Invisible Woman, and Ben becomes the Thing. Other than that, there is no construction to these characters whatsoever. And it certainly doesn't help that these characters show such thin chemistry between each other. It's not until the final twenty minutes of the film when the action finally kicks in, and that's when the team is pitted against Doctor Doom. When Doctor Doom appears, he looks ridiculous. The green coat that he wears over his head looks so fake and the CGI done on the character isn't pleasant to look at either. Lastly, the whole fight against Doctor Doom is super short, lasting for roughly three minutes, and during this fight, audience are greeted with a shortage of tension and excitement as our heroes effortless take on the villain who's intention on destroying the world is supported with no real motivation. By the end, you're left with the feeling of ""What! That's it?"". It is pretty disappointing. I have to say I was quite disappointed with how Fantastic Four turned out, probably one of the worst additions to the superhero genre I've experienced in a long time. From it's like able cast and timely source material, I had so much hope for this movie. If there is sequel planned, the writers and director should really consider some major changes, if there are gonna show some improvement.",Fantastic Four
86,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Fantastic Four? More like Fantastic Bore!,1,9 August 2015,"I WANTED to like the movie, but the film is so devoid of character development and clear direction that it's like a joke, without any humour whatsoever. This is quite easily the worst superhero film since Batman and Robin, if not, actually WORSE! I'm not joking here, I'm not kidding, I'm not getting paid to say this, I'm not copying what the critics said either; I genuinely hated this movie because it was a movie that wasn't meant to happen, and doesn't care that it's a lifeless production that will be sold in supermarkets for under $10, which you can donate to a hospital or charity than kill your own sense of boredom in this hateful steaming turd.Fantastic Four is a B-Grade movie rebooted for todays audience, except it takes itself too f*cking seriously and has NO plot development or character development. It's like Josh Trank had no confidence in the film when he told the cast NOT to read the comic books. That's like an actor trying to play Hamlet except you DON'T study the character or the play. What's the bloody point if you don't do that?This is 'The Last Airbender' of 2015, the 'Dragonball Evolution' of superhero movies, the 'Howard the Duck' of horrible sci-fi. If anything, the critics who gave this thing 'zero stars' praised the damn film more than anything else. IT'S WORSE THAN WHAT THEY SAID!This is a film that should have died in the first place, and I'm sorry for Trank that he got the receiving end of the criticism. It's not his fault; it's 20th Century Fox's fault. They're a once great studio that turned to trash fairly recently, and only their 'Fox Searchlight Productions' seem to be of any consistent high-quality lately.I feel I should rap this up soon, because there's too much to say about this movie without getting into spoilers, but I was shocked by how generic this was for such a $120 million movie. It's like Foodfight level of investment money that just didn't payoff in the end; it just adds to how bad the film already was.Fant4stic is a failure of storytelling, a misfire of film direction, an appalling example of big- budget effects, and no acting bonding during the film, apart from MAYBE Johnny Storm's father in the film. The mock-buster of the year is this: Fant4stic: 1/10.",Fantastic Four
87,Troy_Campbell,Truly awful. Worst film of 2015 so far.,1,8 August 2015,"The pair of mid-noughties F4 films are generally accepted as subpar comic-book flicks. Compared to this garbage reboot, however, they are downright masterpieces. Promising young director Josh Trank was handed the keys to this superhero franchise after his blistering debut Chronicle, yet it appears he's not ready for big budgets as he makes a complete and utter meal of it. Stories of on-set quibbles and Trank's uncooperative behaviour have surfaced recently, and the final, woeful result certainly reeks of a movie struggling to be made. There's not a single, solitary redeeming feature to be found; everything from the shocking CGI to the disinterested cast to the appallingly dull origin story is yawn inducing at best. It's difficult to tell what is worse: Trank's uninspired screenplay and his subsequent incompetent direction, or the fact that 20th Century Fox, who interjected months ago, are willing to release a pile of crap just to stick to their date slot. Either way, this remake is going to be a huge blow to both the up-and-coming filmmaker (who has also since lost his gig of helming a Star Wars Anthologies instalment) and the major studio company who clearly can't be trusted to do the F4 brand justice. At least their previous efforts in this series were more kid-friendly than most films in the burgeoning superhero genre, something this remake also fails at thanks to a single sequence with a surprising amount of blood. There really is nothing to recommend in this worthless attempt at movie-making; heck, even the saving-the-world climax feels about as threatening as a kitten attacking a ball of wool. Do yourself a favour and skip this atrocity, unless of course you're just interested to see how dire the worst film of 2015 really is.",Fantastic Four
88,pyrocitor,Fantastic Failure,1,30 August 2015,"It's uncanny to see cinematic legend unfolding on screen - a film to be talked about in hushed tones for decades to come. August 2015 has yielded such a film. Ladies, gentlemen, and puddles of sentient ooze, behold: the legendary disaster of Josh Trank's Fantastic Four. Miserable set stories, drab trailers and re-shoots aside, it's still shocking how bad the final film is. While Tim Story's mid-2000s predecessors were cringeworthy in their own regard, their bubblegum-bright flair for fun made them hard to outright detest – a quality Trank appears determined to eradicate from his reboot at all costs. Indeed, Trank hammers the ""dark 'n gritty"" angle so fiercely that between the unimaginatively muddy visuals (Earth and the craggy alternate-dimension-or-is-it-an-alien- planet-the-film-never-quite-makes-up-its-mind are so universally dank the film may as well have been called '50 Shades of Brown') and venomous script, the only 'fantastic' thing is how all-around unpleasant a viewing experience the film is. Dark superhero reboots may be in vogue, but don't be surprised to see a Rennaissance of candy-colours and one-liners in future super-fare, if only to bury the memory of this dull sulkfest. Most comparably abysmal sci-fi flops are at least hammy enough to enjoyably mock their nonsensical plotting, hokey dialogue, stilted performances, and terrible visual effects. Fantastic Four has all of these detriments in spades, but, practically frothing at the mouth with the bitter 'Trank vs. Fox' spat, is too sour to even gleefully lambast. The film is so unapologetically lazy, with brazen continuity errors, scathingly brief and sparse action sequences, and childish temporal leaps to cover up patches never filmed, that it reeks of self-loathing, almost fiercely proud of how disastrous it is. It gets to the point where the audience starts desperately trying to spoon-feed worthwhile moments to the film out of secondhand embarrassment (""that 15 second fight scene was kind of cool!"" ""Reed Richards disguising himself by stretching his face is clever!"" ""That Borat joke was almost funny..."") before giving up and succumbing to the unrelenting cascade of awfulness. Beginning with an insultingly distasteful prologue exploiting domestic abuse (Trank is so determined to squash fun that even the ever-lovin'-blue-eyed Thing's iconic catchphrase gets sullied), and starring Homer Simpson (no really) as cinema's most discouraging science teacher, the film flashes forward to the serious teen scientists working on their serious science experiment seriously. After an excruciating montage of the universally dislikeable characters welding, trading inane pseudo-science babble, and gritting their teeth and grimacing in a facsimile of ""bonding"", a despicably forced drunken (really?) foray to the alternate-dimension-planet-whatever has the team (sans Sue, because only men have adventures, apparently) mutated by green alien glop (really) in a boring Interstellar rip-off. There seems to be no hope. However, at this point, the film momentarily twitches, like a convulsing, electrified dead frog, and briefly shakes off its monotonous woe. The visual effects introducing the titular quartet first experiencing their powers are effective - Richards' grotesque elasticity is particularly believable - briefly delivering the body horror the film seemed desperate to become. GOOD LORD A POSITIVE OH THANK YOU. Naturally, for this indulgence, Trank subjects audiences to a further half hour of clichéd droning about how serious the serious quartet's serious accident was (seriously!), unoriginally lambasting the mean ol' exploitative military as if spitefully stalling. Rubbing salt in the wound, Trank showcases some decently exciting Thing action sequences, but sadistically restricts them to extreme long-shot blips seen through television screens. Finally: a pre-climax re-introducing the forgotten Victor Domashev-wait-Von-Doom-sorry-who-said-that. Here, in spite of hilariously rocky plotting and characterization, Trank momentarily invests, with an astoundingly gory telekinetic massacre that momentarily flirts with a promising climax to come. Nope.Instead, the film reaches a new low, with a climactic tussle on Doom's planet-dimension-who-cares almost as difficult to see amidst the feces-filter as it is uninspired (each character gives and takes a punch, as if choreographed by a preschooler). If this wasn't enough, the entire affair wraps up in a staggeringly quick 12 minutes, vomiting a final coda so chirpy and upbeat it's disturbingly at odds with the dour mess preceding it. We conclude with arguably the most forced, awkward title drop in cinematic history. Nice. The woefully miscast performers all somehow manage make the dire script even more banal. Unsurprisingly, despite being the most (needlessly) controversially cast, Michael B. Jordan is the only actor to generate anything of worth, with a cocky charisma that feels vintage Johnny Storm. Sadly, even he sputters under the indefatigable weight of the dross surrounding him. Miles Teller is so unimaginably flat as Reed Richards that it would be hilarious if his preening smugness weren't so loathsome instead. Kate Mara fares no better, her Sue Storm so pinched and bitter that the alien green glob is more engaging to watch. The most disturbingly miscast, Jamie Bell may as well have signed on as the Invisible Woman he is given so little screen time. Even when coated in horrifically bad CGI, Bell's perennially moping (and, distressingly, naked, rock-genitalia included) Ben Grimm spends more time sitting sadly in cells than clobberin'. The film's low point (impressive indeed) is Toby Kebbell, who embarrassingly transforms one of the most iconically menacing comic book antagonists into a squeaking, whiny, walking temper tantrum. Meanwhile, Tim Blake Nelson snores through his scenes as the requisite exploitative bureaucrat (so much for him playing Mole Man...), while Reg E. Cathy drones the same banal line about discovery and possibility repeatedly as if sleep-talking. The real Trainwreck of 2015 (sorry Amy Schumer), and almost irrefutable champion of ""worst, most unreservedly self-loathing big-budget studio film ever made"", Josh Trank's reluctant blockbuster is indisputably unforgettablealbeit for all the wrong reasons. As Ben Grimm would dolefully sigh: ""It's Fantastic"". -1/10",Fantastic Four
89,RNMorton,Too soon for a reset,4,23 September 2015,"So the new Marvel thing seems to be resetting some of their heroes with new, younger actors and retelling the story from scratch. There's only three things wrong with that - 1) if we like the original actors there's no reason for the change (other than the studio saving money!); 2) we've already heard this story before; and 3) there was a third reason, but until I can remember it I think replacing guys we liked should count for two. The original casting for FF was great, spot on, and it's not that important to the FF concept that they stay teenagers (that is a little more important to Spidey). Subbing in a new cast came just too soon after getting connected to the original actors. Beyond that, these new folks were ehhhh and the story wasn't very compelling and the action that did happen was on another, bland planet. So not only did they engage in premature substitution (I hate when that happens), the product wasn't very good. Can they still bring the old guys back? Sheesh.",Fantastic Four

91,brchthethird,"Decidedly un-""Fantastic""",4,12 March 2016,"I already knew this wasn't going to be good going in. The only question was ""How bad could it be?"" The answer is ""quite a lot,"" although not irredeemably so. This reboot was directed by Josh Trank (CHRONICLE), and he stated during production that this was going to have a horror vibe to it. He (really, I'm assuming it was him) also made the decision to age down the characters significantly. These two aspects are actually fine with me, as I don't read comic books and therefore don't care about strict adherence to what's on the page. What I do care about is an interesting story with well-written characters, and unfortunately, that's where FANTASTIC FOUR fails. Since what I did like takes up less time/space, I'll start there. Given the material, all of the actors involved did give good performances. There was also the sequence right after the group first comes back from Planet Zero, when they discover their powers. That short scene perfectly captured the essence of what I believe Josh Trank had been going for. Sadly, one good sequence doesn't make a good movie. Everything else falls short. The downside of aging the characters down is that you can't short-cut the relationships and personalities involved in making the team. However, the writers decided to cut corners on this anyway and have the personalities already fully formed, and the team coming together just becomes a waiting game. Secondly, just about everything in the plot happens as a result of coincidence or bad decisions, and with little to no motivation (Doom is probably the worst/best example of this). Thirdly (and, for my sake, finally), there is no conflict until 80 minutes in (of a 100-minute movie). I could go on about how the CGI is barely better overall than the previous two cinematic attempts or that the pacing sucks, but I think you get the idea. The only reason Fox made this was to hold onto the rights. Had Josh Trank been given a little more creative freedom, maybe something a little more coherent and tonally balanced could have been made, but we'll never know. There are a few glimmers of what might have been, but that's like looking for diamonds in manure. The only reason to watch this is out of morbid curiosity, and even then I wouldn't advise paying for it.",Fantastic Four
92,sarastro7,Not much of a Fantastic Four movie...,3,5 August 2015,"I am a long-time comics reader and collector with a great love for the Fantastic Four. The negative buzz that the production of this movie has suffered through for the last year did have me worried, but I was not a hater; I went into this movie prepared to like it if it were good.Sadly, it was a big disappointment. Deeply deficient on the story level as well as the character level. Some of the problems:Sue isn't even on the team that goes exploring in the other dimension; she has been replaced by Victor Von Doom. She just gets hit by an energy backlash as the others return, and in this back-handed ""ad hoc"" way receives her powers. They could at least have addressed in a few lines of dialogue WHY Sue wasn't going to be one of the ""astronauts"". Instead it's just a boys' club. Also, Sue and Reed never get together; there is no hint of a romance between them, aside from a single line of innuendo from Reed at one of their early encounters.Ben isn't a pilot. He's not even from Yancy Street. He's not part of the team, but is only called in to participate in the experiment because he is Reed's old friend.Johnny is hardly in the movie for the first twenty minutes or so, and never gets much development of his own. Is he a mechanic? What can he do, besides weld? He doesn't get any real or memorable character moments. Neither do the others, for that matter.Reed reads like a one-trick-pony who has no other project than the dimension machine. What else do they do at the Baxter Building? Or at ""Central City"" at the end. Reed is supposed to be smart; supposed to be Mr. Fantastic - he is the core of the team, and any story involving him should be intelligent. This script very much isn't.There is little meaningful interaction, chemistry or bonding between the characters, and the very end of the story (when the military just gives them what they demand for no reason) doesn't make any sense. The movie as a whole is dark and humorless and almost as unlike the FF comic as it is possible to be.One of the greatest ""huh?!"" moments is when Sue helps the military find Reed. Sue is opposed to being a super-soldier for the military, but still she apparently accepts that they've turned both Ben and Johnny into super-soldiers, and uncritically helps the military find Reed - when in fact she should be angry about everything they've done. Bunch of nonsense. They're probably trying to show the team's early days, before they understand what's going on, but instead the screenwriters are exposing the characters as dupes who are easily manipulated. This script is a disaster.The main actors, in and of themselves, are not bad. But, for one thing, they are too old. Late twenties, early thirties, for characters who are largely supposed to be high schoolers. It's another thing that sadly doesn't work at all. Also, the way they behave towards each other: They act like moody teens, nonchalant, not looking at each other when they speak to each other, not relating anywhere near naturally to each other. This, frankly, is perhaps what I find most toe-cringing about the movie.In retrospect, this movie actually does look like a half-hearted effort to just put something out there, no matter what, without doing anything remotely artistic to it. I'm sorry to speak so negatively about a lot of people's presumably hard work, but this really turned into a bad movie. I don't know exactly who's to blame, but I hope they learn a lesson from this and won't repeat these mistakes again later.What a shame, and what a dud.3 stars out of 10.",Fantastic Four

I also like what they did with Doom,, he wasn't messing around.I don't like how the movie is a lot of set up. Granted,, plenty of movies don't set up enough,, but too much set up isn't good either. There were a few scenes where the acting was fairly laughable. The writing may be to blame,, but it was bad (and we know the actors can act - Jordan in everything,, Teller in Bleed for this,, Mara in AHS,, Bell in Skin).

96,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A reprehensibly bad reboot.,3,21 January 2021,"For a movie with ""fantastic"" in its title, it's anything but. It's difficult to make a movie that's worse than the original that was released a decade earlier, but here we are. I understand the need to reboot a franchise so the owners of the rights can continue to hold onto those rights, but this is just a sad excuse for a movie. I only hope-now that Disney owns this franchise-that the next reboot of the Fantastic Four doesn't spend any time on its origin story (which we've seen twice now).While the casting for the main characters was technically proficient, if not a little young, I was stunned to see such wooden and emotionless acting from absolutely every actor on the screen. If I didn't know any better, they replaced these actors with CGI robots who state their lines instead of, you know, acting. Additionally, there didn't seem to be any stakes in this film for the main characters to have any reason to do what they did. Things just happened, and they were merely in the right place at the wrong time.It was also surprising how obvious the CGI was. Certain scenes stuck out as clearly CGI, even if they didn't have to be. Let's not even get into the ""look"" of Doctor Doom (Toby Kebbell). Sure, it had its moments, like the look of Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell), but overall it pulled me out of the story. Of course, I glanced at the clock and found that two-thirds of the film had passed before anything even remotely resembling a conflict emerged. Knowing full well who the villain would be, I had no idea what his motivation was right up until he stated it (basically straight to the camera). Overall, save yourself 100 minutes and don't ever watch this film.A reprehensibly bad reboot, I give Fantastic Four 1.5 stars out of 5.",Fantastic Four
97,RforFilm,"Overstretched in length, invisible with chemistry, burned in lame action and rocky in tone, Fantastic Four may be one of the worst comic book movies of all time",1,7 August 2015,"Boy, has Marvel come a long way in terms of movies! The Marvel Avengers are probably the biggest blockbuster stars at the moment, with Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America and so forth have won the hearts of children and adults for being funny, action packed, and seems like a genuine group of friends. If you were to go back ten years before, I don't think anyone would have anticipated a cinematic universe the way Marvel is becoming. Back when the comic company was starting to lend out their characters, many of their creations went to different people. Spider-Man went to Sony while the X-Men went to Fox and many going to Universal and Paramount. Now figuring that out can lead to a headache.Among these heroes are the Fantastic Four, which was one of the original team heroes that got recognition for having chemistry like a real family. I've never read those comics but the imagery seems well enough that cinema could work well in their favor. After all, if the Avengers can get great dialogue out of an Iron clad human and a radioactive monster, it should work fine for friends that all got their powers at the same time. Family is NOT a word to describe the Fantastic Four. Young Richard Reeds (played by Miles Teller) is a prodigy whose had dreams of inventing teleportation ever since he was a boy. Together with his best friend Ben Grimm (played by Jamie Bell), they toy for years until they are found by Professor Franklin Storm who runs a government sponsored institute where young minds can develop their aspiring technologies. Richard is hired to bring his project along with Storm's children, adopted daughter Susan (played by Kate Mara) and biological son Johnny (played by Michael B. Jordan). They also bring along a troubled but brilliant genus Victor Von Doom (played by Toby Kebbell) to build a gate to another dimension.After months of work, the machine is finished and even runs a successful animal test. But the Insitutes supervisor Dr. Allen (played by Tim Blake Nelson) wants to give the technology to NASA or the military for further examination and testing. Deciding they want to stake their claim, Richard, Ben, Johnny, and Victor all use the machine and are transported to another world. While there, they are exposed to a new kind of energy that comes home with them. Victor is left behind who plans on using the new world energy to destroy the Earth.I'm cool with Fantastic Four taking a darker direction, as the previous adaptations have been too cheesy and silly for their own good. But I have to say that I prefer the older versions because of one thing; they are superheroes first and foremost. Fantastic Four may be one of the only superhero movies around that has no crime fighting. In fact, they don't get their powers until an hour into the story and don't even talk about using their new powers till the last fifteen minutes. Aside fromthat stupid move, Fantastic Four is just dull and boring. There's hints of a smart story with the idea of wanted to show our tortured souls, but never does anything with them. It all feels like chess piece story telling. Give your hero's their powers, sent them to training, go after the villain, and that's pretty much it. There's very little action, very little magic and wonder, and there little to no chemistry between Marvel's first family. I don't even recall Susan and Ben sharing any dialogue. It's clear that Fox and the movie's director had problems behind the scenes and it's unfortunate that the audience has to be the one to suffer the consequences. I'll give this one burnt comic book out of ten. Fantastic Four is seriously one of the worst comic book movies of all time. I never felt so much fatigue watching something that could have been awesome. I think it's time that the Fantastic Four go back to Disney and Marvel for the proper treatment.",Fantastic Four
98,Anurag-Shetty,Fantastic Four? More like Underwhelming Four.,5,22 August 2015,"Fantastic Four is a reboot of Marvel's first family. Reed Richards(Miles Teller) is a supremely intelligent aspiring scientist. Reed, with the help of his childhood friend Ben Grimm(Jamie Bell), has cracked the code to transport elements to an alternate dimension & successfully bring them back. This impresses Dr. Franklin Storm(Reg E. Cathey) & his daughter, Sue Storm(Kate Mara). Now, along with the help of Johnny Storm(Michael B. Jordan) & Victor Von Doom(Toby Kebbell), Reed & Sue have to create a device that successfully sustains human inter-dimensional travel. After they successfully teleport to an alternate dimension, an accident occurs which causes shocking physical transformations in each of them. Now, they must use their new found powers to protect Earth from an old friend turned foe. Fantastic Four is an extremely disappointing movie. Honestly, the trailers are better than the movie. Due to Fox interfering & director Josh Trank's supposed unruly behavior on set, this film is completely dull. There is just one action set piece in the movie which takes place during the climax. This battle seems rushed & just doesn't make up for the lack of action scenes throughout the movie. Being a comic book movie, there is absolutely zero humor in the film. So many cool sequences from the trailer don't even feature in the movie. For example, The Thing's dive bomb sequence. The special effects team have done a good job with The Thing but, completely ruined Dr. Doom. Dr. Doom's glowing tin man look is cringe worthy. Because Doom looks so terrible, he is the least bit intimidating. The makers seem so intent on setting up a sequel to Fantastic Four, that they just didn't bother to make this reboot good enough. Honestly, I just want the Fantastic Four rights to go back to Marvel Studios. It would be amazing to see Dr. Doom battle the Avengers. Dr. Doom is one of Marvel Comics' best villains & deserves to be portrayed to perfection on the big screen. Tim Story's Fantastic Four(2005) & Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer(2007) are much better than this reboot. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan & Jamie Bell don't share half as much chemistry & bonhomie as Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans & Michael Chiklis from the original movies. Speaking of individual performances, Miles Teller is good as Reed Richards. Kate Mara is adequate as Sue Storm. Michael B. Jordan is just not carefree, fun loving & womanizing enough to be Johnny Storm. I'm not prejudiced by the color of his skin. It's just that, you can't even compare Jordan's portrayal of the Human Torch to Chris Evans' superior portrayal in the previous films. Jamie Bell is impressive as Ben Grimm/The Thing. The only positive of this movie is the friendship shared between Reed & Ben. Toby Kebbell is a disaster, compared to Julian McMahon's Dr. Doom from the previous movies, as Victor Von Doom/Dr. Doom. Reg E. Cathey & Tim Blake Nelson are effective as Dr. Franklin Storm & Dr. Allen respectively. Owen Judge & Evan Hannemann are great as Young Reed & Young Ben respectively. Please don't make the mistake of watching Fantastic Four in the theater. Wait for it to come out on DVD & Blu-Ray or watch it when it comes on TV.",Fantastic Four
99,fernandoschiavi,"The lack of agility, the lack of rhythm, the lack of action and the anticlimax of the last act harm the film as a whole and confirm the tense atmosphere behind the production",6,18 April 2020,"Seeking to take advantage of popular characters in hand and enjoying the success of the Marvel cinematic universe, FOX launches yet another version of one of the most loved groups in the comics, the Fantastic Four. After the release of two films in 2005 and 2007 - both directed by Tim Story - that did not do so well at the box office and that generated mixed reviews from critics and audiences, the new adaptation was in charge of Josh Trank, who had debuted in the direction of a feature film shortly before with the praised Poder Sem Limites (2012), which also dealt with a group of young people with superpowers.Trank, who achieved the feat of being fired for directing one of the films derived from Star Wars (""Rogue One"") for the behavior in the filming of this new Fantastic Four, whose final product gives the exact measure of turbulent production. The expectation formed around this new version was great and the way this new version would be addressed was the big question. After the first news and images of disclosure with the new cast were being published, the questions began. Later, news emerged that the product did not please the studio and that remakes would be necessary. At this point, it was already certain that the chance of the project sinking was enormous.The film revolves around student Reed Richards (Miles Teller, from Whiplash) and his obsession with creating a teleportation machine. With the help of his best friend, Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell, from The Adventures of Tintin), he succeeds and draws the attention of scientist Franklin Storm (Reg. E. Cathey, from the House of Cards series). Along with Sue (Kate Mara, also from House of Cards) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan, from Fruitvale Station), sons of Dr. Franklin, and the rebel Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebell, from RocknRolla), Reed improves his invention and builds a portal to another dimension, a kind of planet similar to Earth in its early days.The new ""Fantastic Four"" is basically a great introduction. In this sense, some fans must approve the fact that we have more time to identify and get to know the main characters. The origin of the Fantastic Four is practically the same as that of the 2005 film, as is the villain. In fact, this time, many will regret the simplicity of the action and the plot involving the villain Dr. Destino, completely wasted. Obviously, this is an introductory film, but it can't be just that. There must be a history surrounding it that creates a threat to the group that will be formed, something that makes the audience cheer for the heroes, which this script completely fails.
This year's adaptation successfully tries to be more serious and realistic than the one from ten years ago, considered silly and childish by most fans. This, however, does not mean that the reboot is better than the previous version. Having the chance to fix mistakes from the first adaptations made for the cinema, Josh Trank misses the chance to thoroughly explore the origin of each of the four members of the group of heroes, ignored in the first adaptation. Despite the film's large number of dialogues, more minutes were spent talking about science than showing Reed's childhood.The script signed by Jeremy Slater, Simon Kinberg and Josh Trank himself makes different options than previous versions for the cinema. It brings the younger group and starting to create bonds between them. To begin with, the film begins by showing friends Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as children creating their bonds of friendship that would last into adulthood. We can already know from the beginning the problematic families in which friends live, in addition to all the genius of Reed.The option to recreate the origin of the Storm brothers caused controversy for changing Johnny's ethnicity and introducing Sue as his adopted sister / daughter. Nowadays, it seems to be mandatory to want to give representation to minorities in the cinema, even if for that, it is necessary to mischaracterize characters so well known to the comic book audience. The question remains: Is it really necessary to make these unnecessary changes that, invariably, end up displeasing the most fervent comic book fans? These are factors that do not alter the story, except for the fact that he wants to portray a black hero at any cost.Leaving aside these controversial issues, at least we can verify that the couple of brothers Susan and Johnny Storm and their relationship with their father, Dr. Franklin Storm are portrayed in a competent manner. They are still Sue's closest relationship with her father - who work together at the Baxter Foundation - for sharing the same love for science and the most conflicted relationship with Johnny's rebellious and free, who likes to venture out and get in trouble even though he also has a natural aptitude for science. When the worlds meet - and the suspicious Victor Von Doom enters the scene - the gears keep turning without effort. It is a perfectly common environment that has been established.The curious thing about this Josh Trank film is that he dedicates a lot of his time to strengthening the relationship between young scientists. If on the one hand this is good, on the other hand it ends up frustrating the public, which takes almost an hour of projection to see the heroes as the Fantastic Four. We can also see here that the greater focus on family was privileged, both in building the relationship between the members of the Quartet, led by the Storm brothers' father, Dr. Franklin. We can see that the script does not invest in the relationship between Reed and Sue, giving more focus to the Storm brothers and their father. The actor does not go wrong, but he is hampered by all possible mentor clichés. At one point, he says: ""Family means taking care of each other.""
The tone of the film after the second dimensional journey also changes. For months there were rumors about reshoots and the studio's order to have ""more Quartet"" in it and the last act seems to confirm that. There is a sudden break in the action and the ease and speed with which the group ends the villain is amazing. Neither the lives of any of the protagonists nor the planet Earth were really at risk. It gives the clear impression that the script finished everything quickly, causing no emotion. We don't even have time to start rooting for our heroes. What the end does manage to provoke is a certain disbelief in the public. Much of this is certainly due to the tight budget of $ 120 million, which also explains the low quantity, quality of effects and creativity to choreograph the action scenes. It should be noted that most of the budget was spent on heroes, damaging everything else.The impression is that the production had everything to work. With a promising director and a cast of talented young people, we were able to enjoy little. The interaction between the characters works to some extent, but the lack of agility, the lack of rhythm, the lack of action and the anticlimax of the last act harm the film as a whole and confirm the tense atmosphere behind the scenes of the production. Once again, the audience will have to wait to have a definitive version of the Fantastic Four on the big screen. The impression that FOX had to produce something to the touch of a box in order not to lose the rights to the characters, is clear.",Fantastic Four

103,abisio,Incompetent piece of crap,2,9 August 2015,"The 2005 version was too light for public used to Batman; but lacked the comedy that will make Spider Man or later Iron Man such success. In any case; it was an entertaining movie with decent commercial success. Sadly the sequel did not hit the proper mark and felt short compared with the first movie. It seems Marvel / Disney correct errors by changing everything instead of trying to find out why it did not perform properly; but they do it without the proper quality control so things get really worse. This main problem is that the movie is boring; nothing interesting happens until near the end and it is too lazy written and full of commonplaces that you know what is happening even with your yes closed. The second problem is that the incompetent directing, writing and editing pretty much limited the performances of Miles Teller to an unsympathetic character, Jaime Bell (a great actor) to just a few lines he does not even look very convinced (and later to a CGI character that barely speaks) and Tobby Kebbel as a joke of a bad guy (also later to another inexpressive mask). The third problem is that the rest of the cast is even less interesting and they seems to know that so they looks that they were in a rush to collect their meager checks and acted accordingly. The four problem is that with all the stupid things that happens and the bad acting; the movie is overly serious and lacks any humorI believe is time to stop Marvel/Disney short and ask them to put some effort in their movies. Avengers Age of Ultron does not support a second viewing and if people are going to see Ant Man (which is almost a comedy); means they are tired of this crap and with good reason.",Fantastic Four
104,bryank-04844,'Fantastic Four': The Movie Where Nothing Happens!,1,5 August 2015,"'Fantastic Four' has always been a fun comic book. Ever since the early 60s, these four heroes have entertained us in each crime fighting, earth saving, and alien destroying issue. With Reed Richards, Johnny and Sue Storm, and Ben Grimm, there was nothing that these four couldn't handle. One of my favorite story arcs was from the mid-2000's where Ultimate Fantastic Four had to deal with zombies. It was an excellent storyline, one that I wish will be told on the big screen at some point. Speaking of the big screen, the Fantastic Four have never seen a good adaptation.There was a movie in 1994 made by Roger Corman (king of the B-Movies), which was never released. It was only made to secure rights for a friend, and is stuff of pure cinema legend and sought out by cult film fanatics. If you've seen any YouTube clips of it, you know it's terrible. Let's fast forward to 2005, where the guy who made the 'Barbershop' movies was given the opportunity to make a 'Fantastic Four' movie. If you can recall it, you'd remember it was awful and that Jessica Alba was really the only memorable thing from the movies, or at least the most talked about. 'Fantastic Four' is one of those Marvel properties that has yet to be turned over to Marvel itself, and is still owned by 20th Century Fox, which is unfortunate, because that studio still has no clue what it's doing with this franchise.That brings us up to date with 2015's 'Fantastic Four', which is a movie where nothing happens for 100 minutes. The studio hired Josh Trank to direct the film. Trank's only other credit was the ""found footage"" superhero film 'Chronicle' which had its good moments, but supposedly Trank is very difficult to work with, which is why he was booted off the upcoming 'Star Wars' film. Whatever good 'Chronicle' had going for it is non-existent here with 'Fantastic Four' and seems like it's one long set up for something yet to come. Over 95% of the film takes place inside a science lab where we see Reed Richards (Miles Teller) , Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) building a teleportation device and typing fast on a computer rather than using any powers or participating in an action sequence of any kind.Then there is Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), who of course is Dr. Doom and is evil for really no real reason. Maybe he's angry because his name is Victor Von Doom. It's never really explained. For a movie that is really 100 minute of an origin story that is supposed to run deep with character development, we really learned nothing about any of the characters at all other than that Sue loves to listen to her iPod, Reed can type fast on a computer, Johnny likes to race 90's rice rockets, and that Grimm may or may not enjoy his new rock body. That is literally the character's story arcs. Sure they come together and travel thru their teleportation device to another dimension after one of the monkeys from 'Dawn of the Plant of the Apes' does, but that's about it. It's not until the final 45 seconds of the film where we see some fraction of a team forming.I get that this is the start of something new and a big origin set up for future films, but there has to be something at stake here and some sort of conflict. Unfortunately, there isn't, other than at the end of the movie, there is a small crater in a rural area.The only good moment of the film was seeing Dr. Doom show his sadistic and violent powers, but it was over way too quick and was met with some bad directing. Then there is a the issue of the script, which is just terrible. I've seen better dialogue the 'Sharknado' films than I did here with 'Fantastic Four'. Most of the movie is just someone shouting what's happening on screen and what they should do to fix it. It was cringe worthy, complete with Ben Grimm yelling his actions as he's executing it in full on Thing mode. This is a shame too, because there are some very talented actors here who aren't given anything good to work with. My advice is to wait a few more years until Fox gives up the rights to Marvel so that we get a real origin story to this great superhero team.AVOID THIS MOVIE!",Fantastic Four

Whatever the filmmakers vision was before the obvious reboots, that's the film I wanted to watch. Trank had a Fincher movie making experience, Fox pumped an extra 40 million on reshoots and essentially locked the filmmaker out of the editing room. Maybe we might see the director's cut in the future, maybe not, Disney now owns the film.

It's so dire it could become a case study for the contemporary studio system's flaws. But feel for the film's director Josh Trank, whose only other feature was the mildly effective superhero film Chronicle, starring Michael B. Jordon. It cost $12 million dollars and earned over $100 million dollars—a massive return, which would have contributed significantly to Fox's decision to hire Trank to adapt the Marvel comic and reboot the franchise after the two previously dismal films. At a conceptual stage, the negative press was already building. Racist comic book fans rallied against the casting of Jordon as one of the film's superheroes because the character in the comics is white. The Hollywood Reporter site also has insider comments about Trank being uncommunicative on the set, describing him with words like ""erratic"" and ""indecisive"". Furthermore, the film underwent reshoots, which is always troubling when this sort of money is involved. Most damagingly, Trank attacked the film and the studio on Twitter, arguing his version of the film that will never be seen. But is any of this rumour and innuendo relevant? Hollywood now hires inexperienced directors and throws big money at them because they believe they'll be obliging. But isn't granting a relatively novice filmmaker top dollars and not expecting trouble playing with fire? No other industry in the world throws money around as carelessly as Hollywood. On this occasion it's burnt a lot of people and potentially ended a career that's barely started.A better cut of the film wouldn't dispel what unconvincing tripe this is. The technology in this film is ridiculous and treated a bit like that Internet joke ""because science""—starting with a boy genius building a mini teleporter in his garage. As grownups, Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) showcase an improved teleporter at a science fair. Reed is invited to join a research group in the city to help build a new teleporter. Half of this dreck is dedicated to building the machine before anyone receives their superpowers. Can the machine forward us an act or two? It's rare to criticise a superhero movie for not having enough action but given how underdeveloped, nondescript the characters are and how boring and lacking in tension the film is, any heat would have been a reprieve. The other characters include Professor Storm (Reg E. Cathey), who has a hilariously deep voice, his son Johnny (Jordon) who drag races so we know he's a rebellious, Storm's adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara) who talks like a computer and has one look on her face and Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell), who leaves the blinds closed because he's dark and moody—nothing sinister there—and whose original theory has been completed by Reed. Once the real teleporter is constructed, the film becomes monumentally stupid. After a few drinks, Reed, Ben, Johnny and Victor decide the very night the teleporter is completed they'll test it themselves. Let that resonate with you for a moment. And if you were teleported to a mysterious alien plant—while intoxicated no less— would you touch some mysterious green goo? An explosion leaves the kids with superpowers, except Von Doom who is left for dead on the planet.The way the film collapses from this point is both sad and unintentionally hilarious. The film's disjointed shape—a result of those reshoots—is painfully evident in the gaping plot holes, time lapses and incoherent story threads. For example, the film forwards a year to when the characters are under military supervision and only then does Johnny's father—slow on the uptake—tell his son he's worried what the military will do to him. Trying to make this film dark and serious in tone also falters horribly, not only because there's a talking rock monster but because von Doom makes for a laughable villain. This cut of the film tries hiding him as long as possible. In his short appearance, the bad von Doom stares at people until their faces explode—except the heroes—and he sneaks in clunkers like: ""there is no Victor anymore, only Doom!"" His showdown is appalling rushed, perhaps mercifully for the audience. However, it's meaningless to throw anymore fuel onto this disaster. It's an awful movie but it's important to remember that inexperienced directors like Josh Trank are made the scapegoats for big studios and corporations that gleefully overspend with the wrong people at the helm and then cast the first stone when the project fails. It just can't continue this way.",Fantastic Four
108,timdalton007,Not So Much Fantastic As Mixed,3,18 March 2016,"So I finally sat down to watch the Fantastic Four film from last year on DVD thanks to my local public library. Yeah THAT one that became one of 2015's biggest disappointments and has been effectively been given a total write off from fans and critics alike. With a reputation that large hanging over it, coming to the film was difficult without wondering if it would be as bad as both its reputation and critics suggested. So was it?The answer is...sadly yes.Rarely have I see a film with such potential (if one can say that) go to such waste. The film, based more off the Ultimate Fantastic Four run than anything else, manages to utterly mangle the origin story of one of the strongest superhero teams out there. It does so thanks to hackneyed dialogue both between characters and every time someone decided they're going to give a speech (especially Franklin Storm) as well as some major plot holes and failures in logic. Indeed the entire film after its opening five or ten minutes becomes a series of ever compounding issues. Those issues are compounded by disjointed editing that jumps around all over the place with leaps in time that lead to ""telling"" not ""showing"" which leaves actions and events largely unexplained. All that before the film decides that it's going to introduce its villain and big threat with all of maybe a half hour of its running time left. The result is a film where the plot is even more nonsensical that one expects even out of the poorer quality superhero movies of old.It's perhaps possible that if other elements in the film had been strong enough they could have at least partially salvaged the film. Sadly though, the problems only compound from there. The quality of the performances is incredibly variable ranging from decent in the case of Kate Mara's Sue Storm to adequate in the case of Michael B Jordan as Johnny Storm to incredibly wooden in the cases of Miles Teller as Reed Richards. Some of the performances can't rise above the writing and dialogue, such as is the case with Reg E. Cathey and Tim Blake Nelson. Then there's performances which are hard to judge such as Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm who starts off being slightly miscast but whom seems to excel once he becomes his mutated member of the Fantastic Four. Perhaps because of the script and obvious re- shoots (obvious from Mara's changing hair and Teller's facial hair), performances were lost or potential lost but whatever the case the result is incredibly mixed.The same can be said for the film's production values. The film tires so hard from the direction of Josh Trank to the cinematography of Matthew Jensen to be a darker, grittier take on the Fantastic Four as compared with the two films from a decade or so ago. Indeed the visuals remind one of Bryan Singer's earlier X-Men films with a similar color palate but the rest of the film leaves one feeling cold and removed from the action. The special effects are a mixed bag as well ranging from excellent (in the case of The Thing) to iffy (The Human Torch who looks weak compared even to the effects from a decade ago) to laughable (Victor Von Doom and Planet Zero). Backing everything up, or perhaps trying to hold it up, is a strong score from Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass which might well be the best thing to come out of the whole film. Buried in the midst of its 99 minute time are the occasional nuggets in a wasteland such as the score and some of the effects. For all of the good or even decent elements in the film, it seems a shame the rest of the film was a mess of bad scripting, wooden performances and a generally disjointed feel to the whole enterprise. The result isn't so much ""fantastic"" but an utterly mixed bag that's only for die hard fans of the superhero genre...and this would be a hard way to die.",Fantastic Four
109,Bolesroor,Chunkburger with Cheese,1,7 August 2015,"""Fantastic Four"" (2015) is a dismal, abysmal, painfully-lame action movie based on the legendary comic book of the same name. What goes right in this picture? Almost nothing.Our lead actor Miles Teller (Reed Richards) has the face of a turtle without its shell. And he wears glasses. This does not stop director Josh Trank from doing endless closeups of Miles' chubby, geeky, inexpressive face.The entire pace of the film is off, with far too much time being spent on the origins of the Fantastic Four gaining their super-powers. By the time the characters actually go to fight crime there's twenty minutes left in the film, and the finale is a humiliating rush of action clichés so predictable that even the children in my theater had lost interest and were talking in their seats.The entire second act of the story- in which the Four test out Reed's inter-dimensional transporter- is triggered by the team getting drunk one night and deciding that traveling to another dimension would be ""really cool."" Reed even calls his best friend & basically says, ""Dude! You gotta get over here! This is freaking' awesome!"" No explanation is given for the other dimension, for HOW the four gain their powers from traveling there, how the team gets back to their home dimension or how they magically arrive back on Earth at the end of the film. This is sloppy writing that slaps you in the face and laughs at the fact that you paid for your ticket.A sub-plot about Reed escaping from the military facility at which the Four are being held goes nowhere, accomplishes nothing, and fails to further the story or characters in any way.The cast shares ZERO chemistry, the ""jokes"" fall instantly flat, and the final scene of the film- where Reed suggests the group come up with a cool name for themselves- is awkward and sad:THING: This place is fantastic.REED: Wait a minute- say that again...Yup. That's it, folks. That's how they got the name Fantastic Four. My face was red for everyone involved in making this hot manure sandwich. Bad music, dull actors, blank faces, dialogue by Mrs. Johnson's second-grade class, zero conflict, cheesy visuals, and no story.Is that enough or are you actually still thinking about watching this movie?GRADE: D-",Fantastic Four
110,mahmus,Nothing really happened in this movie.,2,31 March 2021,"They go to another dimention, they get their powers, then Doctor Doom shows up, they fight him and it's over. There's practically nothing else.We never see them learn to use their powers, we never see them getting to know each other, we rarely see the four together for most of the movie. All of that is skipped. We're told it happened, but we never see it, only glimpses of it in the backround.There's some good scenes. The cast is good. The effects are good. It is composed of scenes that belong in a good movie, but lacks all of the esential pieces to make it a good movie. The end result is just really bland and boring. It's not even worth getting mad about; It's just kinda sad.",Fantastic Four
111,MrDHWong,"Flat, short and underwhelming",5,23 December 2015,"Fantastic Four is a reboot of the superhero film series of the same name. Despite being an improvement over the previous two films, this outing felt flat, short and underwhelming. It gives us just barely enough time to get involved with its story and characters before the movie is finished.Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is a child prodigy who invents a teleporter that can send objects to another dimension. After demonstrating his teleporter at his school's science fair, Reed attracts the attention of Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), the director of the Baxter Foundation, a research organisation for intelligent young people, and offers him a job there. Reed accepts and teams up with his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell), Dr. Storm's son Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) and adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara) and Storm's protégé Victor Von Doom to try and recreate Reed's teleporter to transport matter to a different dimension. The first teleportation goes wrong and Doom is left stranded in the other dimension while the remaining four are exposed to radiation which gives them all unique powers. One year later, the four of them team up to use their powers to stop Victor Von Doom, who somehow survived (we're never told how) and now wants to combine the new dimension with Earth's.While the action scenes were decent, albeit short, everything else is bland and very forgettable. It just felt like that the film was rushed out to compete with the current, better Marvel films. The cast, while nothing special, was much better than I thought they'd be. I did like this film's incarnation of Doctor Doom compared to the original film's. The movie's biggest problem, in my opinion, is its short running time, just 100 minutes. It feels that the climax was barely 5 minutes long and left me feeling very underwhelmed.I rate it 5/10.",Fantastic Four
112,CANpatbuck3664,It's Not Devoid Of Good Stuff But There's No Getting Around How Bad This Is,4,6 April 2016,"As much as there was a huge amount of hype around Batman v Superman, it wasn't too long ago that Fantastic Four was supposed to be the next giant franchise for 20th Century Fox. They got a supposedly visionary director in Josh Trank and Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan were up and coming stars so there was a lot of promise there. But in the months leading up to the release, reports started coming out. Supposedly the studio and Trank couldn't agree on anything, that they had to do massive re-shoots and that Trank buckled under the pressure. Even with all the seething hatred the movie was getting, if it was good, I would say so. But it wasn't and I hate to say it but it probably has set the bar for failure when it comes to big budget comic book adaptations.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We begin the movie with young Reed Richards talking to his elementary school class about the teleporter he plans to build. He's made fun of by his teacher and his peers. We then meet young Ben Grimm who lives with his large lower class family. They own a junk yard and Ben catches Reed scavenging for parts. Instead of getting him in trouble, Reed brings his device to Ben's basement to try to show him what he's working on (the teleporter). Reed decides to test it and they end up blacking out the power of their entire neighbourhood.We then flash ahead to when Reed (Miles Teller) and Ben (Jamie Bell) are in high school. They have done a project for the science fair on their invention (which they have been working on ever since). There are a couple of surprise visitors Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter Sue Storm (Kate Mara). Reed fires up the device and it seems to work until the built up energy destroys part of the gym. Reed and Ben are disqualified but Franklin is impressed and invites Reed to join him at his facility for young prodigies (the Baxter Foundation) as they have been working on something similar for years. Reed is reluctant to leave Ben behind but Ben encourages Reed to go, he was always meant for bigger things. In that spirit Reed leaves and quickly adapts to his new surroundings, helping bring new insight to the project.With movies that I don't end up liking I try to start with the positives. In both of the Tim Story Fantastic Four movies, the biggest focus was on the budding relationship between Reed and Sue. I liked that this movie took a different approach, it's more about the friendship between Ben and Reed (it's a good thing too because Teller and Mara are pretty awkward in their scenes alone together but I digress). I thought a couple of the actors were good, my favourite performance actually was Reg E. Cathey but it's largely wasted by the material. There was also one scene I really liked. When Fantastic Four come back from Planet Zero and they have ""accidentally"" discovered their powers, they cannot control them and they are in agony. I thought that bit was really well done, it was almost like a horror movie and you sympathize with them and Dr. Storm, he's having to watch his kids suffer. Unfortunately, I thought it might turn the movie around but just as they're getting deeper into that, the movie flashes forward and cuts off the momentum.So getting into what didn't work, people talk about Batman v Superman not having any levity or lacking a required amount of fun. I had those complaints too but man is this movie so much worse for those exact same reasons. There are jokes but they are so awkward and poorly done it's embarrassing. The actors have so little chemistry together and because of that the emotional beats outside of that one scene don't sell at all. Character motivations go by the wayside minus Reed trying to take care of Ben (Doom went from more of a disgruntled youth to a mass murderer pretty quickly and on a slightly off topic point, why couldn't they have just transported him back to Planet Zero? What's the downside? Maybe he wouldn't have tried to destroy the world) and the characters make really bad decisions (even though we're on an undiscovered planet and we have no idea how the environment will react to us being there but let's go touch that mysterious glowing green goop). I just found it sad that a movie with so much work put into it could be so fundamentally flawed.I could have tried to look past all that if the movie had offered a payoff at the ending. There's very little action in Fantastic Four, which was disappointing but it's a stylistic choice that I could have understood. But at the end, the Fantastic Four are only an actual team for the last 20 minutes. The ending battle is just plain unimpressive too. The CGI was okay but you would have thought they would have come up with some cool ways to use the heroes' powers and integrate those in but they just don't. Not every superhero movie needs a big action finale but the movie kept teasing you that it was coming and then it just fizzled, I was so let down.I have seen worse films, I just want to make that clear. Even though I've never read the comic, there is a reason these characters are so iconic and I think the movie just missed the boat on why people enjoy this material. I'm glad they scrapped the plans for the sequel, I don't see how they could have recovered it. For all the complaining around some big superhero movies that are mixed bags, this doesn't even hit that level, it's a complete misfire.",Fantastic Four
113,Laakbaar,Not as bad as some are making it out to be,6,6 August 2015,"I think this movie is getting a bum rap here. I enjoyed it well enough. The detractors are making this movie out to be a disaster, and that's not the case.In fact, I thought this movie was better than most Marvel films I've seen lately. (But then I'm not into Marvel comics, and I generally dislike most Marvel movies, which I think are noisy and tedious.)Here is a Marvel origins movie that is not a video-game experience dominated by dreary overblown action scenes and homoerotic cardboard figures. (I suppose that may explain why it's getting rather low ratings so far.)It had a decent story, OK character development, a good pace, some interesting science fiction, and so on. This is a Marvel movie with exposition and rooted in the real world - how often do you see that?OK, the downsides...The movie was earnest to the point of being wooden. A little too cliché. It did not have a lot of humour. I was not moved at all. The character of Franklin Storm in particular didn't quite work for me. Not sure whether it was the acting or the role. Probably both.It's worth about 6.5.",Fantastic Four
114,dfa120374,Not So Fantastic,4,22 March 2016,"From what I saw of the trailers, I was quite looking forward to seeing this reboot, and I was glad it was a different cast also, as I thought the casting for the '05/'07 movies was terrible (aside from Michael Chiklis). Alba is useless & just cannot act, Gruffudd was as wooden as a sideboard dresser, and McMahon's portrayal of Dr Doom was pretty lame to say the least. It was really the action & effects that kept those movies heads above water for me as there wasn't much else going for them.Unfortunately this reboot isn't actually much better than those previous two films, so this ultimately ended up being a big let down too.From what I've read, there was a lot of behind-the-scenes troubles between Josh Trank, the producers, FOX, and the cast which probably contributed to the film bombing and not being as good as what it maybe should have been. Major re-shoots (causing a huge difference in run-time), script changes, disagreements, fights, major differences in film direction...no wonder the film was a bit of a disaster.That aside, though, the film itself still wasn't all that exciting, especially for an Action/Sci-Fi. The film needed to be longer and you see this when the ""main"" fight between Dr Doom and the Four lasts for merely minutes and it takes about an hour for the film to start showing the transformations of the main characters. I understand the need for build up, but when there's too much build up and not enough of anything else, it just feels rushed.Also, why the need (other than political correctness) to cast a black actor for the portrayal of a white character this time I have no idea. Imagine the uproar if a white actor played Muhammad Ali.The film did have a promising start, with some decent build up on how things would pan out, but it never really grabbed you. At least the visual's were good, The Thing was MUCH better this time, and Dr Doom was more sinister looking.That's not enough pluses in a sea of negativity, though.",Fantastic Four
115,Delrvich,Good but could have been better.,7,1 May 2017,"I don't like most comic book movies and really like very few of them. I think most of them deviate far too much from the source material, but, its been apparent that's never going to change. So I am writing this review with that in mind. It was good, but, could have been easily been better.The effects were great, acting was good, but, Dr. Doom's backstory was a bit of a stretch and the movie ending was an ever bigger one. It would seem that the movie was either redone with a different ending or drastically shortened resulting in a hasty denouement.",Fantastic Four
116,SquigglyCrunch,This Happened...Someone Looked at This and Said it was Good,1,4 May 2016,"Fantastic Four follows four people as they attempt to travel to other dimensions and ultimately gain superpowers from doing so. They then decide that they want to find a way to reverse this, but major authority threatens otherwise. I knew this movie sucked. I went into it knowing it sucked. But I thought it'd be mediocre. Just mediocre. I've sat through mediocre movies before and it's not so bad usually, but this movie makes them look like bloody masterpieces. There were a couple of scenes that I liked, but every time they passed I thought 'wow, that was a decent 2 seconds'. Everything good about this movie was short-lived. I did like the tone of the movie though, it was darker than most Marvel movies. Fantastic Four doesn't even know what it's plot is, so I can't really say anything about that. It kind of skips around, like one moment this is the main plot, then it skips through a few years and a new plot is introduced very suddenly with half a resolution to the last one, and then another short plot. It's one of those movies where you can't really explain the plot without spoiling most of it. There's nothing wrong with this structure, but this movie had no idea what it was about, and it shows. So much of this movie feels like it just flies by due to how short all the conflicts are. Thankfully, that means that it felt like it was over pretty quickly. Everything terrible about this movie is in everything else. The dialogue seems like it was written by someone who's never spoken to another human being, or strongly dislikes doing so and thinks that everyone else does too. All of it is extremely short-lived and awkward, and oftentimes comes out equally as awkward. Some of the one-liners towards the end were so poorly executed I had to stop and process that it just happened before continuing with the movie. The rest of the dialogue is just so poorly written that it makes it hard to give a crap about any of the characters. And let's touch on the characters, wow, they were terrible. They have about one character trait each, and the writers didn't even try to make them go deeper. I saw absolutely no attempt to make anyone actually give a crap about these people. On top of that the acting really isn't anything special. Don't get me wrong, I like some of these actors, but I'm not so sure now. Kate Mara was cute at least.The special effects in this movie really weren't very good either. Maybe it's because I just saw the Jungle Book, but holy cow, they were not up to the standard at all. There was one particular scene where the Thing head butts another character, and I wanted to laugh, it looked atrocious. But I didn't laugh, mostly because I was already crying. Throughout the movie I thought 'Oh, this is just going to be a very mediocre movie' which is exactly what I expected, but then the climax started, and that was scary. Not scary good, scary for humanity. I was scared for humanity after that climax. It was as if the writers were writing the script and suddenly they realized that the climax was coming up, so they quickly tried to remember which villain they had partially introduced before and just slapped him in there. The villain just kind of appeared and started killing people. It wasn't even entertaining, it just sort of happened. It was so incredibly rushed. And the villain's objective, oh boy, that was great. Also, I'm sarcastic. His main goal is so underdeveloped and stupid. Again, it just kind of happens out of the blue. The villain is pretty much all powerful at this point, he can kill people without even trying, and yet when pitted against the Fantastic Four themselves it's like he doesn't want to kill them? Or he loses his powers all of a sudden? Then he gets some weird new powers that are never explained, and nothing makes sense. We get a clichéd garbage fight scene, some horrible one- liners and just horrible dialogue in general (again), and then the fight continues and ends in the stupidest and most rushed way possible. Everything about the climax was absolutely horrendous, and it destroyed any hope left for this movie. As I sat in my chair, legitimately crying at how bad it was, the falling action and resolution starts, and it's awful. And to top it all off, it hints at a sequel. That I'll probably watch. Oh boy.Overall mere words cannot describe how bad Fantastic Four is. I could talk about this movie for hours and just list and elaborate on every little thing that I hated. This review only scratches the surface. I would never, ever watch this movie again, not even at gun point. I already was when I watched this movie the first time. I pointed a gun at my head, whispering 'Don't you do it, movie, don't you-you just did it, why...'. It took so much of my energy to watch this movie. It was legitimately difficult to watch, and not in a good way. This movie has set the standard for bad film-making, and I think that I'll have to go back and change some of my lower ratings just because of this. My hope for Marvel was renewed with Ant-Man, but once again crushed by this movie (I'm not a huge fan of Marvel unlike many people seem to be). In the end I'm sure you know whether or not I'd recommend this monstrosity, but in case its still unclear, that's a no.",Fantastic Four
117,billygoat1071,Forcing the Elements,3,9 August 2015,"This is the fourth attempt, counting the unreleased 1994 version, to give one of Marvel's most popular superhero teams, The Fantastic Four, a live action feature; and among these installments, Fantastic Four (2015) seems to have its very own vision, though being overly criticized by comic book fans about casting Johnny Storm, who is traditionally a white blonde, with an African American actor and the age of Reed Richards and Ben Grimm are the youngest, which is a total contrary from the comics. But these gripes are nonsense compared to the faults of the actual film. The movie takes a lot of time making sense out of its absurd science which will lead to an origin that rather feels forced, thus fails making an at least engaging superhero movie.Most of the first half focuses on a science experiment about traveling to another dimension which happens to be the source of their powers. So far, this makes for an intriguing premise talking about the importance of their nonsensical science, but also ties in with a friendship between Richards and Grimm and some issue about the Storm family. In theory, this is supposed to represent youth or family or whatever and we could somehow see where this is going. But the movie hardly explores this potential and just skims the narrative right after they gain their superpowers. It doesn't let these characters shine and just hangs them as nothing more than potentials. But what really ruined the experience is how horribly contrived the whole superhero elements are. The story is so reserved from actual story or character development, even the plot jumps an entire year and assuming that a lot has happen, except we rarely felt anything happened at all.And so, the movie just forces itself to be a superhero movie, forcing the team to work together as the villain who immediately goes evil almost destroys the world out of nowhere. These are supposed to be what we're seeking for here, but it's just too shoehorned to appreciate. There is supposed to be some subtext that we should rather concentrate here, but again, the storyline is unable to keep focus. And it's disappointing, while it's trying to be gritty or epic or awesome or what else; this is supposed to be an opportunity for this team to have actual fighting. Observe, the other movies made them do nothing else than team work, which is nice, but only few had any real fighting, which is today's appeal to superhero movies, and the superpowers of these guys doing actual fighting may look pretty cool on screen. But again, it's all shoehorned, because it is supposed to represent something about their powers that the movie also failed to explain.The action scenes are either rushed or just around the edges being expositions, which is odd for an era of larger and much explosive superhero films. People might call it ""refreshing"" for focusing more depth than bloated action. It's understandable, but depth is really nonexistent in this movie, and depth cannot be mistaken with over- serious. The cast has a lot of real talents, but doesn't quite shine here. Miles Teller can be a solid Reed Richards and the first act does hint some intrigue, but then the movie lacks the depth and even forgets about this character as he is given a sudden lone adventure in the middle act. Kate Mara suffers with an underwritten Sue Storm. Michael B. Jordan can bring levity, but there isn't much about this Johnny Storm either. Ben Grimm is a more vulnerable character here and Jamie Bell does live up to that definition, but again, the movie lacks depth. Toby Kebbell can be sinister, but Doctor Doom here looks too ridiculous and ugly to take seriously. Tim Blake Nelson is another good talent wasted and Reg E. Cathey is made robotic by generic preachy dialogue.Fantastic Four forgets how to be superhero movie. I'm not sure what the movie is exactly trying to say to the audience, but much like the action, everything seems rushed and underdeveloped. It's all about weird science and then we go to oppressive governments trying to weaponize their powers. It's interesting, actually, except it's not fleshed out really well. The storyline is nothing more than just hinting, shoehorning and preaching for some thought-provoking themes(?) that doesn't go further. It often feels like an incomplete film or just some bored viewer skipping some scenes, except strangely, even the cool parts are being subdued. It's not horrible since it does try to be something else, it's just not executed very well, which is a shame. As a fan of these heroes, it's just another sad moment to question ourselves: is it really hard to make a proper Fantastic Four movie?",Fantastic Four
118,Rickting,The Batman & Robin of th 21st Century,1,18 April 2016,"Fantastic Four (Or Fant4stic since that's the title the awful marketing campaign used) reboots the story of the Fantastic Four. Here's the set-up: Some supposedly brilliant scientists get drunk and decide idiotically to use the teleport they just built to go to a mysterious planet where they all get superpowers. Then, nothing else happens. Well, virtually nothing anyway. Some stuff to do with them at a research facility and Dr Doom, who proves the Marvel Cinematic Universe don't have the monopoly on terrible villains. So, this looked pretty bad and had a turbulent production. But did it all work out OK in the end? Well, there are inept films and then there's this. How on earth was this released in this form? Did no-one realize how bad this movie is? It doesn't even feel like a movie. It just feels like various bits of different movies directed by different people who were each trying to tell a different story. The direction is terrible. The dialogue is excruciatingly awful. All of the talented actors give terrible performances except for Michael B. Jordan. The film is hopelessly dull, emotionally blank, incoherently plotted and overall less intellectually and viscerally engaging than a YouTube compilation of Slasher movie death scenes. If you thought Spider-Man 3 was bad, wait until you see this monstrous mess of a movie. This one was truly baffling and let's face it: are the Fantastic Four even that interesting? They basically have the powers of The Incredibles, who are a far more interesting family, and all their powers are just very basic superhero powers. We don't need to see anymore of them.

Jordan and Reg E. Cathy were great in the film and I dug the computer effects on The Thing but that's really it. The rest of the film is drowning in a plot that spends a lot of time going nowhere and only establishing an antagonist and conflict minutes before the credits. Additionally, the characters never really feel like their comic counterparts and the film is trying way too hard to make itself gritty without any desire to actually make the thing watchable or even remotely entertaining. They even went as far to make the cocky hot-head Johnny Storm an angsty guy with daddy issues and take The Things signature catchphrase and give it a depressing backstory.This film might have worked as a breath of fresh to the characters and might have helped Fox build their own little cinematic universe but, in order to do that, Fox had to actually CARE about what they were creating and it was very clear they didn't.",Fantastic Four
120,MattBrady099,Fantastic Failure,2,9 August 2015,"I honestly can't believe I'm going to say this, I never thought the day will come when I say that Batman & Robin is no longer the worse superhero movie ever made after seeing this movie, but the difference between the two is that at least Batman & Robin was fun to watch and not depressingly dull that Fan4stic was. The story is about a contemporary take on the classic super-hero team - four young scientist are involved in an experiment where they find themselves teleported to another dimension. When they return, they find themselves gifted with unique powers - ones they will have use to stop an evil rising to power. It's been 10 years now since the 2005 ""Fantastic Four"" was first release. Looking back on that film is like looking back on a bad memory that you wish will fade away. The 2005 movie wasn't all that good, but to me it wasn't on the same level as Batman & Robin as some people think. Rise of the Sliver Surfer was the squeal that nobody asked for but they're made anywhere because...well I don't know they just did. The squeal wasn't all that great just like the first movie, but the movie itself wasn't like the worse thing on the planet as some people have make it out to be. I'm not going to talk about the 1994 movie because it's not worth it. Now here's 20th Century Fox fourth attempt of making a Fantastic Four movie. We got a new director and a new cast to start off fresh and try to make a new franchise. Many people didn't react very well to the news of a reboot and people got even more mad at the new cast and the fact that they young and Michael B. Jordan was cast as Johnny Storm. I was the only one giving this movie a chance as I believed that Josh Trank will make a great Fantastic Four movie and make us forget the other ones as Josh Trank is a good director. But it's not until I sawed the movie myself and my jaw was on the floor not because the movie was amazing, but how god awful this movie was. Fantastic Four (Or best known as Fan4stic from the posters) is one of the worse superhero movies of the year and of all time. I heard a lot of bad things coming from director Josh Trank. Some people who have worked with him on this movie have openly said that he was awkward to work with and at one point he actually came on set drunk and intoxicated while filming a scene. The problems that happened behind the scenes really do show in this movie, as I can tell they did some re shoots as Kate Mara hair keeps changing color in a couple of scenes. I blame the studious for changing a lot of things and making it a living hell for the director and the cast. Josh Trank is best known for directing Chronicle and that movie was a smallish movie that Josh Trank had a lot of freedom to work on with and at least they're wasn't any studious coming in and changing things and making it really hard for everyone else. It's very clearly that Josh Trank wasn't ready for something big like this as he was originally suppose to direct the upcoming Star Wars movie but dropped out because he had enough. The biggest opportunity that was wasted was the cast. They didn't do a terrible job as they characters but they didn't do anything special and that's a real shame as these are great actors that had nothing to do in this movie. The visual effects in this movie are probably some of the worse looking effects I've seen since the early 90's and it's quite shocking that this movie with a lot of money behind it and have such awful looking effects. The CGI used on The Thing was completely hideous and I kind of miss the 2005 Thing a little bit. Some people may like the CGI used on The Thing but I didn't. These a shot in the movie where Reed Richards after he gets his super power stretches his face to look like someone else to be in disguise, when he puts his normal face back and the CGI used in that one shot looked laughably bad. There wasn't a single shot in this movie that didn't even look convincing. Now lets talk about Dr. Doom in this movie or I like to call him Mr. Freeze number 2, because Dr. Doom is this movie was a complete joke and he wasn't in the movie that much, he just turned up towards the end of the movie. Dooms motivation in this movie was pretty random and wasn't well written at all. Before Victor turns into ""Doom"" the only character development that we got from his character is that he thinks he's smarter than ever one else and he just hates people...WHAT!. The way Dr. Doom looks in this movie is so freaking awful, I mean he looks like that robot from Superman 3, but if put a black bin bag around it and set it on fire and let it dry out a bit, then you add some Christmas lights around it and now you got Dr. Doom. The final battle scene with Doom and The Fantastic Four is only five minutes long, yes I actually timed it to see how long it was and it was too short and disappointing.",Fantastic Four
121,ArchonCinemaReviews,Another terrible misstep for Marvel entertainment,3,10 August 2015,"This year's Fantastic Four is dull and dreary and devoid of any thrills.As far as Fantastic Four's faithfulness to the comic book subject matter, we can't speak of it. In terms of audience reaction and entertainment, it fails on all fronts.Gifted young scientists build an amazing machine that teleports matter to an alternate universe. Yearning to be the historically important first humans to travel across time and space, the transport themselves and endure horrifyingly dangerous ramifications. Transformed by the experience, they fight to harness their abilities and must work together when one is turned malevolently villainous.The problem with Fantastic Four as a Marvel action film is its structure. It lumbers about in multiple directions without clarity. At first, it invests nearly 40mins in what the screenwriters surely felt was character and plot development but is in fact filler. Filler focusing entirely upon the scientific accomplishment of building the machine which would ultimately transform them. While this tidbit is vital for the narrative, there is no reason for it to take up 30% of the movie and the execution is so poor it fails in that regard anyway. The next 25 minutes is a montage of the characters and their powers, again, necessary but stretched out. The final 30 minutes is a scramble for a climactic build up and conclusion, which is both random and sloppy. Honestly, to say that even that much 'happened' in the film is a gross overstatement.Jeremy Slater, Josh Trank and Simon Kinberg, are all responsible for this abysmal adaptation. Fantastic Four fails at screen writing 101, there is no central conflict, no propelling force that yields an intuitive story for the audience to latch on. Sure sure, some people may say ""hello, Doctor Doom!"" but he is only featured physically and mentioned in passing for about 15 minutes of the first hour. There is the big bad US government, as always, but they are more a passive villain. It's actually offensive that studio executives green-lit the script in the first place.Fantastic Four is a wholly missed opportunity to improve upon the underwhelming original of 2005. The casting was superb and the actors did an adequate job given the material, but the Marvel film was doomed from the start given the script. The first Fantastic Four might have been cheesy and overly saturated but the 2015 version is dull and dreary.Please check out our website for more full reviews of all the recent releases.",Fantastic Four

Once they realized what it was they started meddling and this is what you get . Don't hire a director if all the producers think they know better. Enjoy the first half and as soon as they get their powers it's the studio's movie and becomes very generic and crappy.",Fantastic Four

If you know the comic, you know they are not kids like they portray them in this garbage!! Also, the Storm siblings are not what they show in this, white & black!! Why they tried to REMAKE this franchise is a mystery because the two before this were pretty darn good, unlike what most want to say!! The 2005 version was slow for a reason, THEY HAD TO BUILD THE ORIGIN!!! Not having MCU involved is another reason it was good & worked!! MCU has ruined the marvel comic movies just like the DC movies have been ruined since Batman Returns & Superman Returns!!

124,p-jonsson,Not as bad as some people say but still a Hollywood screw up.,6,15 December 2015,"I was actually not having great hopes for this movie giving how Hollywood have screwed up with a lot of my favourite super heroes (Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Dare Devil and a few others). Having said that maybe there was still a glimmer of hope given that some of their latest Marvel work have been rather okay. Unfortunately this is not the reboot of the Fantastic Four that I, and a dare say the fans, hoped for.One thing that I do not understand is why the dumbass script writers that Hollywood employs always have to change the basic story of a set of characters that have a solid fan base? There was nothing wrong with the original story, and thus origin, of the Fantastic Four and the source of their powers. Maybe I am just old-fashioned but still.The second gripe I have with this movie is the nonsensical stuff with members of the Fantastic Four, especially Ben, being deployed by the US military. It is just so cliché. Lazy script writing plain and simple. Unfortunately this also causes the movie to not really feel like it is a Fantastic Four movie. The team is split up and it is not until the very end that they actually become a team, gets a headquarter and so on. Big fail as far as I am concerned.Having said all that, I do not think it is as bad as some people claim. There are some good stuff in there. The story is not all bad after all even though it is not exactly to my liking and the special effects are quite okay. One thing that annoys me with the story is that the role of Reed is really diminished and he is never really allowed to show of his powers. Yes, I know, there are some ""stretching"" moments but, well, meh! To add to the pain the actor cast as Reed is, in my mind, totally unconvincing.The bad guy is also somewhat underwhelming and thoroughly predictable. As I said a classical Hollywood concoction aimed towards the less intelligent viewers. I do not understand why Hollywood seems to be so bent on repeating the same mistakes over and over again? Well, as I wrote, the movie is not as bad as some people claim but it is far from great. Given the abysmal reviews I am afraid that we will not be getting a sequel which is a shame. This is one of the (few) Marvel comics that I read as a kid (in Sweden we did not get treated to that many of these kind of comics) so it is indeed a bit of a disappointment that they managed to screw this movie upagain.",Fantastic Four
125,dcarsonhagy,The Not-Really-Fantastic Four,4,9 April 2016,"The studios in Hollywood seem to have a ""pitch-til-you-win"" attitude when it comes to doing a movie regarding the Fantastic Four. If memory serves me correctly, this would make the fourth (counting ""The Rise of the Silver Surfer""). Each one has gotten progressively worse. It seems the director of the newest version was at loggerheads with the powers that be. This confusion, sniping, and undermining shows in the final product.This version is the actual beginning of what would finally bond as the Fantastic Four. We begin while two of them are in grade school trying to sell their final product in order to win a science fair. They fail. Fast forward to high school and the two are still trying to win a science fair. They fail again. And then the government gets involved and the movie gets even more boring.As in most cases, the horrible script tolled the death knell for this gargantuan mess. The effects were decent, but effects do not necessarily make for a decent movie. Also, if you know anything about science, you will have to throw caution to the wind to accept what this foursome does. Rated PG13 for science fiction violence--and very little of it--the Fantastic Four is not fantastic. In reality, it really isn't much of anything. For kids 12 and under.",Fantastic Four
126,xamtaro,"Fantastic Fiasco 'Foxed up'""",5,18 August 2015,"Fant4stic four reviewMuch has been revealed about the fiasco that was FANTASTIC FOUR 2015. I'll leave the details of the isolationist director, close shaves with angry cast members and a studio's overboard executive meddling for your internet search engines. Let's get down to the movie. Caught in-between the deep and gritty of Warner/DC and then kid friendly comedy of Disney/Marvel, FANT4STIC FOUR (as it is stylised in promotional material) is a curious creature which tried to do both and ended up.......not so successful. It tried to go for the ""grounded fantasy"" of DC, all angsty, deep and tragic, while still wanting to maintain the appeal to youngsters with witty jokes and superficial laughs. Many have slammed this movie for its lack of action and deviation from the explosive norm that has become superhero films. I feel that audience have just become spoiled by the action heavy formula of modern blockbusters. FANT4STIC FOUR is not a superhero movie in that sense. It would be more in line with the ""science gone wrong"" genre of movies that were real big in the late 1980s through 90s. A common complain is that it is too dark but dark can be good if directed and written well.What FF lacks first of all is coherence. The story is a straightforward one: science goes wrong, tragedy strikes, heroes forever changed, then they band together to save the world. Tone wise, The movie's story starts off as a kind of ""science fiction Harry Potter"". It's the story of boy genius Reed Richards getting accepted into an institute of geniuses. Then once an experimental teleporter is completed, Reed and pals boldly go where no man has gone before on to the planet of CGI wonders. From there the tone whiplashes into a Syfy original with the four friends captured and experimented on. Guilt ridden Reed escapes, and we get another tone shift into a fugitive movie with Reed on the run and his former friends trained by the military to take him down. But wait there's more! A new teleporter is completed which brings back a powerful new foe who wants to destroy the world leading up to a climax right out of Dragonball Evolution. You see where this is heading? It's like four different movies cut and pasted into one. FANT4STIC FOUR (FF) had intriguing ideas that I could get behind with enough twists from the original comic to make it fresh. None of those ideas get developed at all! Second big mistake. Sue and Reed being intellectual rivals is something new but it just gets turned into......not even a romance or a friendship for that matter. Johnny not being able to live up to his father's expectations. Yes he acts out, yes he finally gets to step out of daddy's shadow by using his new powers to make a difference to American peace keeping efforts......but that is only implied with some dialogue and never brought up again as if Johnny were a token minority character. Then we got Ben who could have turned out most refreshing. Unlike his comic counterpart who is was a baseball champion, US marine, pilot and an all round big tough guy, Ben in this movie is a scrawny loser picked on by his siblings, living in a junk yard and with little future to look forward to if not for his friendship with Reed. What an intriguing character arc it would have been for Ben who goes from wimp to rock covered Captain America. He becomes a war hero in the service of his nation all the while despising the inhuman Thing he had become. Do we get to explore that internal dissonance? No. His grudge against Reed for turning him into a monster? Forgotten in 5 minutes. Ben who was shown to never hurt a fly has been made to kill for his country, but no single mental ramification at all. No regret? No crisis of conscience? No character development, pure and simple. The 2005 movie, Heck, even the cartoons managed to give Ben Grimm a more developed character than this movie showing him grappling with the loss of his humanity going from all American hero to ugly Monster with all that entails. Mishandled and miscast, Ben Grimm as the Thing looks great in all his motion capture rock encrusted glory. But every time he speaks and that wimpy TinTin voice comes out, it's almost hilarious. Boasting a budget of $120 million, one wonders where all that money went. I've already mentioned how good The Thing looks thanks to the motion capture expertise of Weta digital, the guys behind Lord of the Rings. But everything else looked cheap. From the CGI Baxter building to a CGI monkey likely reused from Dawn of the Planet of The Apes to the entire CGI ""planet zero"" looking like a video game. Throw all that in with a climax that is all to short and sloppily edited and you have FANT4STIC FOUR. The best example of wasted potential in a superhero movie. It had great ideas, bright new concepts open to exploration and development but alas got caught up in all the behind-the-scenes debacles. The drama during production overshadows the lack thereof within the actual movie. Who knows? To recoup on the loss Fox may release ""the making of"" feature and makes tons more money capitalising on the controversies involving director Josh Trank.",Fantastic Four
127,James_De_Bello,6/10,6,12 September 2015,"You know what, I am going to say it right away: I liked this movie! I was going in with the lowest expectations possible, I was thinking I was going to hate myself for being there are giving this movie money, but on the contrary I came out actually pleased. Of course it has its flaws, buy a 9% on rotten tomatoes and a 4,0 on IMDb is totally out of proportion guys, come on. I think too many people just jumped on the band wagon that the internet started and didn't even give this film a chance and I am very saddened by that.I thought that the ridiculous drama that happened behind the scenes for this film was going to pester me throughout the whole duration and surprisingly enough I was only partially bothered. OK, so lets just address the elephant in the room right away, there are no two ways around it: that climax was poor. The whole Dr. Doom stuff happened in the arch of fifteen minutes and was absolutely out of nowhere. By far I will admit the worst part of the film was his arch, his motivations and obviously his design and powers. It was just ridiculous. But you know what? Even then I wasn't hating anything about this and I will explain why later. Just to close the point on the fact of the behind the scenes drama, which, with the exception of that whole climax and some uneven editing that came around every once in a while, I didn't even notice and wouldn't have had I not know beforehand.What ultimately made this movie work for me in almost every scene were the characters. And I will admit it up front, maybe the fact that I am a comic book reader and the fact that I love the Fantastic Four made me fill in the gaps of what wasn't there, but I really, really liked those characters. The actors were all very well cast and gave committed performances too. I was expecting Miles Teller to be phoning it in like in ""Divergent"" (and be it clear: I am a big Teller fan), but he was always convincing as the character. They were likable, there chemistry was on and every time they were in danger I felt true tension. I don't know why, but it's something innate to feel tension or not and I did. The stakes were always there and I was always hooked by them.Furthermore the CGI by all means isn't excellent, but it used when it needs to and en-chances those moments as it should. The Thing looks amazing I will give it that. The powers they have are always used genuinely as anyone would use them and it really elevated some parts. Especially that climax, as I said before I was never despising it and that is because I did have that connection to the characters and because they always felt true. I was excepting this film to collapse miserably at any moment and it never did.Of course I have to address the fact that the film does not have a central story for you to hold your breath for, that it slips a couple too many times in silliness and that it skips some very important story beats that needed to be there. In no way this film doesn't have those flaws. But I wasn't bothered by them as much as I thought I would and ended up having a decent time at the cinema.",Fantastic Four
128,scottshak_111,Another failed attempt,6,26 August 2015,"There isn't just one thing wrong with this movie. I don't know why Marvel has continuously failed to milk the Fantastic Four cow so far. I came to know Fox had something to do with this reboot, but hello! why not give everything back to Marvel that actually happens to have the golden goose and is on a super hit spree? The movie kicks off really well. By the time things reach its peak, where it actually matters it begins to dwindle. True colors of the flick are revealed when the director chooses to take a time jump instead of catching the heat of the moment. From there, right there! things go downhill.SPOILERS AHEAD: It had somehow managed to nail inter-dimensional teleportation bit. The science made a silent promise to bring in characters like Galactus and the Silver Surfer in the long run, which appeared promising. But alas! Everything hit rock bottom when important scenes for e.g the trauma right after the change, finding about their power, and the science behind it etc. were simply skipped. Trank decided to go without the crucial scenes of the movie. That being said, editing was pathetic. Even the visual effects didn't appear out of the world. Sue Storm's power looked weirdly animated. Trank spent a lot of time building the characters in the first half that he forgot to cash in on them in the remaining, when they actually get their powers. When he was really supposed to hit home run, he decided to take a walk and that too a very mediocre one.There is this scene where Johnny Storm takes out a drone which looks absolutely unreal and pathetic. It looked more like a video game. Likewise, couldn't help but yawn at Reed's and The Thing's fight scenes. There is really no focus in the movie, or a score that would rivet you, force you to pay attention.Trying really hard to look at the bright side: One dialogue about scientists being overshadowed by people who are put to test was pretty good though. The world remembers only the pioneers who actually step into someone ideas, who wear the suits and not the brains behind it. Also, Doom's entrance and aftermath looks dope when he bursts open heads. Sheer gore there! The screenplay is poorly written. It was really disgusting to see the whole team struggle to get to their group name eventually. Where is the subtlety?

This ain't the first nor the second not even the third time they've tried to do a live-action version of Jack Kirby's classic comic but the FOURTH time- and they still can't get it right. Hm. Wonder what's going wrong...? Sure, THE FANTASTIC FOUR was ""just a comic book,"" but it was one of THE all-time Great Comic Books and Kirby's run of 100 consecutive issues the stuff of Legend to those of us who grew up loving comics. The first attempt at a live-action FANTASTIC FOUR was so financially challenged (much of it was shot in darkness, for obvious reasons) that it was shelved so fast that it never saw the light of day (except on YOUTUBE, of course, which is where I saw it); the second and third attempts weren't much better, despite the fact that they had money enough to do the entire 100 issue run by Kirby (with enough left over for a large, buttered popcorn and a Cherry Coke)... and now, this. To be fair, this movie's not badly directed (in fact, it's VERY well directed; I was genuinely surprised, expecting something akin to the previous abortive attempts) and some of the fx are truly outstanding (truly).

132,TheHonestCritic,One of the worst superhero films of all-time? Pretty much.,1,18 September 2019,"""Fantastic Four"" (2015), also known as ""Fant4stic"". Wow, putting numbers in place of letters in movie titles is really getting old, and this is certainly one of the worst examples of that! Any way, let's get to the review. Well, this ""movie"" sucks! Saying that this ""movie"" sucks is an understatement if there ever was one. This is the worst overall Marvel superhero film! It may not be part of the official Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, but it's still classified as a Marvel film, unfortunately. This is one of the most boring ""movies"" I have ever seen in my life. It has the same old cliched storyline, terrible acting, underwhelming soundtrack, boring sets/locations, and also, surprisingly, for a modern ""movie"", the special effects look cheap and even a little cartoon-like! I love the first two ""Fantastic Four"" films from 2005 and 2007, and even the unreleased version from 1994! Those movies are masterpieces compared to this ""film"". It's like during production the film makers said: ""wow guys, check it out! We have full creative control of these superhero characters. How can we possibly ruin it?!"" Well, big shock, since it's modern movie times, they did. They did nothing to improve on the real storyline, the actual story is entertaining compared to this! Something else to point out is that the words ""Fantastic 4"" are not spoken at any point during the ""film"". They almost say it at the end, but the end credits show the words on the screen. Wow, even the actors were embarrassed to say ""Fantastic 4"" in this ""movie"". Talk about embracing the concept with pride! The ""acting"" is dull, boring and abysmal. Another thing to point out is: why is The Thing naked? His character is not naked in the comics, he always wears pants or some other form of clothing. Well at least in this ""movie"", we can't see his ""thing""! The rest of the cast is abysmal and completely wrong for their characters. Another thing you'll notice right away if you're unfortunate enough to view this ""film"". Almost all of it takes place in dark rooms, or other locations with hardly any lighting. Sounds exciting, right? What, did the film crew forget to pay the electric bill? Finally, the soundtrack is lazy, overproduced, boring and generic. There is nothing positive I can salvage from this ""movie"". This ""film"" should have never been made! I rate this ""movie"" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. Ignore the 1 star rating on IMDB, if I could rate this ""film"" lower than 1 star on IMDB I would. My real rating is 0 stars! Another big shocking thing to point out is that the director of this ""movie"", Josh Trank, said, and I quote: ""A year ago I had a fantastic version of this. And it would've received great reviews. You'll probably never see it. That's reality though."" Sadly, that's the truth nowadays, money now seems to be more valuable than making entertaining movies. Also, it's a coincidence that the director's last name is Trank. That perfectly describes this ""film"", tranked! From that point, he completely disowned the film, and it's no surprise why. Even the late, but great, Stan Lee sent Josh Trank a letter asking if he was okay. Wow, there's ouch, and then there's bludgeoning to the head! Do yourself a favor, stay away from this ""movie"". Trust me, I'm saving you 100 minutes of your time! This ""film"" is anything but ""fantastic"".",Fantastic Four
133,GeorgeRoots,"120 Million Dollars?! Somebody Sold Us A Broken Record, Don't Fall For This Fake Mess.",2,10 August 2015,"It is an incredible age for the comic book fan. Obscure characters are finally managing their way to the big and small screen, and obviously certain companies are grossing large amounts of money because they have put the right talent and creators to work on these mega franchises. Unfortunately ""Fantastic Four"" still remains to be done right, especially with the respect it deserves. I don't really wish to dive into what has been reported as a wealth of behind the scene problems, but in the end how could you not be frustrated with the resulting picture?Of course early trailers promised a much younger cast and some controversial casting choices, more importantly however it offered some very drastic storyline decisions that was sure to disappoint hard core fans of the comic book series. None of this ever really bothered me, I just wanted to see the characters done justice and see something with more edgier material than 20th Century Fox's last two outings. The comic itself was more Science-Fiction than Super Hero to begin with, and by the time of this movies release every actor had gone on to receive great acclaim in other projects. Director Josh Trank had already shown great confidence with 2012's ""Chronicle"", displaying great camera movements in a genre that doesn't really lend itself to much (Found footage to me has many ups and downs). The first 20 minutes reaffirms that Trank can confidently work in this genre fine, so just how bad could it all get?Well it wasn't screened early to critics and the cast hadn't seen it, that's a good sign right? Child prodigy Reed Richards, introduces new friend Ben Grimm to a machine he has built that can transport small items he believes to somewhere else on the planet. Cut to seven years later, shady government scientists decide to recruit Richards (Now played by Miles Teller) to perfect his device that is actually capable of something much more special. This scenario introduces Susan Storm (Kate Mara), Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) and Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), who will help construct the device that will obviously lead to the powers we all know and love (Ben Grimm later played by Jamie Bell, just kind of fits into place somewhere).Again, while the first 20-30 minutes moves along at a brisk pace, the film slowly builds towards a disappointing 2nd act, to an absolute abysmal 3rd that manages to do something special most bad movies make me do. I reassessed everything from the beginning and saw that there was no real development between characters, and no great events that made me feel connected to these people as a family unit. No depths explored enough when it came to their predicaments, and the effects were so awful the first 20th Century Fox movies actually offered more in terms of action and payoff (I cannot believe that the shallow 2005 movie is actually better than the darker re-imagining a decade later).To explore a little bit of the controversy, Fox had reportedly cut 3 big important action scenes and most clips of the trailers don't actually appear in the final product. The editing of this movie is so atrocious the re-shoots of Kate Mara's many wigs and hairstyles are blatantly forced into scenes that obviously don't match. I don't know who was responsible for wanting to hit the 1 hour 40 minute mark so poorly, but I would sit through more of anything just to stretch out what was again a horrendously rushed final battle where Doctor Doom himself acted and looked ridiculous (Seriously, one of the worst costume designs ever created for a film, and I thought the concept of his space suit fusing to him was a good idea). The final script was also atrocious, cutting some many promising first draft ideas by Jeremy Slater. Whatever dialogue remains is poorly executed among characters and actors I slowly became less interested in as the movie progressed. Doom became evil for the sake of doing so, and Reed fled because he was afraid, but coming back a year later (I.e. captured) was enough for Ben and everyone to ultimately forgive him (Who knew?). I could go on forever, but what I will say that I enjoyed about this mess is that the directing was good at the beginning, the music by Marco Beltrami & Philip Glass worked wonders, and the David Cronenberg-ish ""body horror"" moments were actually very well done and the best thing about all this.Final Verdict: I don't know who is to blame for this mess, but this is just unacceptable and the critics have spoken. Obviously money has been lost as a result, and I hope that it wakes someone up at Fox to realise that your audience demands more from this stuff nowadays. Of course I was upset as enough was marketed to me to hope for the best, but to not put a substantial amount of footage you marketed in a trailer a month before release into the final product, you have essentially LIED to everyone (I cannot recall a current movie that has ever done that, and that is this movies downfall). Just watching the film it felt like I was in the editing room watching 30% of footage quickly clumped together. It's broken, lazy and falls apart in every aspect. 2/10. I hate being mean, but everyone involved in the production is better than this. Grab a shotgun and take this movie round the corner Fox.",Fantastic Four

Acting awful,,,script dreadful,,,bad action sequences,,,terrible story,,,this was a bad attempt to reboot an already tired concept. Felt like a long trailer and went absolutely nowhere. Along with Antman , I think the whole Marvel bandwagon is suffering from a few loose wheels and should think again about what direction to go in. It was not even a waste of a good idea and had zero potential from the word go. Nothing I can say would put across how bad this drivel is.

137,troyputland,Marvel's first boring film.,4,4 January 2016,"Fantastic Four, Marvel's 2nd film of 2015 (but not tying in with the MCU), is a remake that comes ten years after the F4 with Chris Evans. This time, Miles Teller leads the team alongside Kate Mara, Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan. All are young actors who're breaking and defining the Hollywood scene, some a tad more so than the others. Marvel hasn't yet disappointed me as a superhero fan, until now. This is an origin story, focusing around 90% of its time on getting to know the characters and how they got their powers. The remainder of time goes to the mediocre villain. A younger audience may still enjoy this, but for me, it dulled around the half way mark. It pains me to say this, as I believed Marvel Studios could do no wrong. FF's characters lack flare, even when they become 'fantastic'.",Fantastic Four
138,kermitkid,Destroy at all costs!,1,30 March 2020,"Dear Fox,
You've officially proved 3 times now that you can not make a good Fantastic Four movie. Just give the rights to Marvel studios already and let them control it.
How did Josh Trank go from making a great movie like ""Chronicle"", to making this? This doesn't even feel like a superhero movie. It's so boring. It's an hour and a half (without credits) and an hour and 15 minutes is spent on the so-called ""origin story"". By the time the film actually got to the action, the thrill was gone. I was out of it. I didn't care anymore, and just wanted the film to end. They messed up Dr. Doom. When did he have romantic interest in Invisible Woman? Oh, yeah. That's right. Never. And The Thing's motion capture just looks creepy. this movie makes me so angry. The Fantastic Four's powers sure would come in handy in destroying this movie, though. Mr. Fantastic can throw this movie into another dimension, Invisible Woman can make the ashamed filmmakers invisible, and put force fields around them to shield them from the rotten tomatoes I want to throw at them, Human Torch can burn all copies of this movie, and Thing can smash all copies of this movie.
Grade: F+. 0/10. 0/5 stars",Fantastic Four
139,jb_campo,Decent acting but no plot,6,15 February 2016,"Fantastic 4 is not as bad as portrayed. The story is really pretty interesting. I really liked the youth scenes of Reed growing up and his friendship with Ben Grimm. The high school scenes are also good too where you meet the Storm clan, and Viktor. Storm's father is really good. The acting really is good, and the actors are all cast pretty well.However, like most people state, there is no plot. There's this interdimensional machine they build, then go there, something happens. They become the F4, and that's about it. There is a pretty unsatisfying battle, really just one, and the movie ends.If they had promoted this as a new Origin movie, it might have been better taken by the public. I am curious to see what happens with F4 from here on. Let's see if Marvel can clean this series up - so far - not very fantastic, but not as terrible as others state.",Fantastic Four
140,luke-a-mcgowan,"Its flawed, but I never hated it",5,1 September 2015,"All through this much-maligned film I kept waiting to hate it. And I just kept waiting. Fantastic Four might not be X2 or Iron Man, but its not generic to a fault and there's even a few specks of inspired goodness inside its hasty 90 minute run.The biggest problem is a complete lack of identity. The reported reshoots and shutting director Josh Trank out of the editing room means that this film has no directorial icon on it. Without any firm directorial hand on the tiller, the film wanders around without any sense of purpose, and its left to dialogue, acting and techs to salvage anything from it. The techs are for the most part quite impressive - I enjoyed the sound editing of the Thing's voice, the visuals were mostly impressive (yes, I said mostly, relax!) and I found the score particularly effective - especially a tingling, horror-tinted moment of reveal for Reed's stretch ability. It was much more effective and a lot less Ioan-Gruffudd-on-the-dance-floor-cheesy.Jamie Bell was my biggest concern going in - how can you replace all around tough guy Michael Chiklis with the kid who played Billy Elliott? But knock me down, Bell ended up being my favourite casting choice of the lot. He was tough and brooding, but there was also hurt there - hurt and horror that I never felt from Chiklis, now that I realise it. Teller, Mara, Jordan, Kebbel and Cathey are all acclaimed actors as well, and whilst they don't have anything particularly memorable to do here, I found that each of them was more than sufficient. Problem is there's literally zero chemistry. For example, I didn't buy for a second that Cathey had raised Mara. She barely interacted with him until his death, which was brushed over quicker than your average Wilhelm screamer. Cathey has one nice scene where he demands to see his children, but the choppy plot never settles long enough for him to flex his acting chops. The script was clearly something quite good until Fox chopped it to pieces. There's some quality dialogue (Kebbel's complaints about Neil Armstrong are particularly good, and Jordan's quip about Instagram made me laugh even if it was stupid), I loved the idea of the kids getting drunk and wanting to go into the dimension, and I really liked the military angle of the story. About the point of the ""1 year later"" is where the story starts noticeably falling apart. Its quite clear that that frame is there to cover a large chunk of movie that was cut from the final product. Plot holes are abundant: - Planet Zero is apparently magic. It can sustain Victor for over a year without any need for food, etc, and has completely breathable oxygen for the final battle. - Reed is completely combat effective and can battle a number of fully trained soldiers with his abilities, despite being a science geek in hiding for all of a year. - Why do they need Reed to rebuild the machine? Don't they have literally any of the notes he would have taken? - Why does Sue get powers if she was just on the computer? - Reed's science teacher at school is literally the worst. He has no interest whatsoever in science, and is probably the biggest caricature I've ever seen.The final confrontation with Doom is utterly ridiculous. Not since X-Men: First Class have I seen such a brainless and pointless massacre of all the film's minor characters and extras, or such an anti-climactic and swift villain demise (though I think First Class was still worse). The film in general suffers from a lack of climax, now that I think of it. But honestly, its not as trash as people make it out to be. I liked the angle, Bell's performance as Grimm, and some of the plot and script choices. Had Trank been allowed to do his thing, I think this would've been really good. As is, I'll tolerate it. Its better than The Incredible Hulk, by a long shot.",Fantastic Four
141,nicolechan916,Middle-of-the-road,6,29 June 2016,"Having not so bad an impression of the first Fantastic Four movie back in 2005, it seemed to me that this reboot was unnecessary. Seeing as it wasn't any better. I quite liked the actors from the 2005 film too. For me, this reboot lacked character development, as well as plot.Having read form other reviews that the movie is not heavily based on the comics, it makes me question the reason they want to reboot this at all. Seeing as the story is based on a comic book, straying from that would not only angry the fans of the comic, but also, make it increasingly difficult to make it a success. I was not invested in the story much, and was expecting more action. Though I guess I can't say much in this review, because I did miss a few scenes here and there (I was on a plane, and kept nodding off). I won't attribute it being boring for the reason I couldn't stay awake, because I might've just been tired.Anyway, I am not such a fan of Teller, but he did a reasonably good job in this. His nerdy act as Reed was believable enough. Other actors/actresses like Bell, Jordan, Kebbell and Mara also did well in their roles. As well, Owen Judge and Evan Hannemann who play the young versions of Reed and Ben respectively, are a good addition to the film. It gave some background as to their childhood and how they became friends. The visuals and the effects are nicely done as well. It seems nowadays that the visual aspect of a film is the one thing that cannot go wrong (mostly). Overall, it isn't such a terrible watch, but isn't anything special.",Fantastic Four
142,trublu215,A deplorable attempt at cashing in on something that didn't have a chance in the first place.,3,5 August 2015,"Fantastic Four started catching my eye in the casting stage. Seemingly not giving a damn about the source material, it was refreshing to see those kind of balls especially from Marvel. While I welcome Michael B. Jordan as The Human Torch, I wish I could say the same thing about the rest of the film. Fantastic Four is merely a reboot that loses its steam after the first act. Coming in at just over an hour and a half, the film is a rushed piece of reject summer movie drab. The characters are paper thin and about 10 years too young for their respective roles. The visual effects are far from stunning, especially The Thing, whose transformation into the ghastly beast is something closer to a PS2 game than an actual film with a $100 million price tag. Miles Teller proves here that his performance in Whiplash is truly a fluke. As Mr. Fantastic, he struggles to sound like he knows what he is talking about. Perhaps a little more rehearsal time and a little less focus on that cheap looking silver streak in his hair could have benefited him. Kate Mara as Susan Storm is about as idiotic as it can get. Mara is a great actress, there's no other way about it but Kate Mara as Susan Storm is terrible and borderline embarrassing. The biggest shock here in this film is where all the controversy started...Michael B. Jordan as The Human Torch. Jordan's ability to be a badass likable gear head is insanely good. He's the best part of this film by far. If there is anyone that could single handedly carry this film on their back, it is him. The film overall is too dark for Fantastic Four and too shallow for Marvel which leaves it drifting somewhere between ridiculous and not necessary...and at times, both. If there's any movie to see this summer, I can assure you, Fantastic Four is NOT it.",Fantastic Four

144,dallasryan,Had Potential,5,30 March 2019,"Had potential, but...Yeah, the many 'what went wrongs' with this film. The Fantastic Four with Jessica Alba wasn't perfect, but at least there was chemistry between the four of them and there were some good fighting scenes, and it was fun at times.This version of Fantastic Four falls flat in every area. There is no chemistry between the four of them and that's because there's no arc built for them to come together as a team. This film needed another 30 minutes of fighting another villain so the chemistry could come together because at the end of the film, you're saying to yourself 'I don't want to see a sequel with these four again.'Also, there's no arc for an apology by Reed (Miles Teller) to Ben (Jamie Bell). Yes, Reed apologizes, but Ben never forgives him, but instead, they fight Doom together for 10 minutes and then all of the sudden everything is peachy keen between the two of them. There was never a scene showing the forgiveness. There was never a scene where all four really fight together and become a team, and show the chemistry. There was never really any fun.

146,Jerghal,Seriously underrated...have you actually seen a really bad film?,7,27 October 2015,"Sometimes I wonder if people ever saw a REALLY bad movie? Fant4stic got some very harsh reviews and comments. A 4,1/10 score on IMDb and 9% on Rotten Tomatoes? By comparison Cyborg (a REALLY bad film) got 5,0 and 14%. So with these scores I was expecting it to be a disaster of epic proportions, the worst comic book film ever as some have referred to it...But halfway into the movie I thought well this is still okay maybe it's the second half. But no again, the movie never actually get's bad. I'm not saying it's fantastic either but biggest problems imo are that there is not much spectacular action, some VFX don't look that great (but a lot of movies seem to have that problem these days -cfr San Andreas / T5) and Victor Von Doom looks like a crash test dummy. But on the other hand I like the darker look of the film and the cinematography was pretty good. Most of the VFX shots are pretty decent (apart from aforementioned ones) and the acting is fine (if you think that was bad acting - see Cyborg). Another comment people have is that the whole movie is exposition. What they mean is that there is actually to much talking and not enough wall-to-wall action but it helped the characters and I didn't find it a problem at all. After they get their powers they feel a bit like freaks and in the real world that would be the case. You wouldn't go off playing a hero right out of the gate. I have to say I enjoyed the movie and it does serve (or was intended as) a bit as a setup for future sequels but it also works as a stand alone film.

But, this film proved me so wrong, that it's barely even funny anymore. Despite me really not liking Suicide Squad, this movie somehow makes that film look like a cult classic, as this movie is so incredibly uneventful and painfully boring, that it's debatable whether or not it's more fun to stare at a wall. This is because this movie tries to set up another movie that never happens while completely forgetting to make a good movie on its own. Literally nothing happens in this movie. All it is is exposition. It sets up the fantastic four universe, and nothing more. It stretches throughout the entirety of this film, which can make this movie extruciatingly boring. And no, there's nothing about this movie that isn't bad. While the actors did a decent job in their roles, the script and scenes are so bland, that nothing really worked. The special effects in this film are attrocious for the amount of money this movie needed to be made. Nothing was convincing whatsoever, and the fact that they were so below subpar for the amount of money used for this movie really makes me question humanity somewhat. Overall, there's not a single thing that's good about this film. It is so boring and slow that even the worst films can be more of a joy to watch than this, as this is an absolute painful slog of a movie.",Fantastic Four
148,stevenfallonnyc,"Shameful horrendous film disrespects a great comic, but not a bad ""bad"" film",6,5 December 2015,"I should start this off by saying I am a lifelong Fantastic Four fan - they're my favorite comic, so much so that I managed to possess almost all the original series run. The Thing has been my favorite superhero since I was ten years old.As a big fan of superhero flicks in general, I was always disappointed that a great FF film seemingly could never be made. The Corman '94 version is still the best one as far as keeping close to the classic material. The ""Alba"" movies are horrendous. Then I heard this was coming out.Let me get this out of the way - there's been all this complaining about the black Human Torch, and let's be clear, it has absolutely nothing to do with ""racism."" Again, this has been my comic since I was ten - speaking for myself, I simply want to see the source material respected, and the characters that now have been part of the American Fabric for 54 years (again, I repeat...54 years!) to simply be who they are. The race change was a very obvious politically correct pander to get a black audience - but last time I checked, many blacks have always been big comic fans, of the black AND white heroes. And the Torch is a classic hero - one of Marvel's very first, if you count the ""golden-age"" Torch of the 40s and 50s. Change simply for the sake of change does absolutely no one any good at all. There was no need for a Torch race change and that part of the film is simply ridiculous.There will still some that will say that's ""racist"" - well, go cry me a river, because you're wrong. I'd say the exact same thing, being a comics fan, if they made Luke Cage white in his movie. And they will make it...and guess what race he'll be? That out of the way, obviously other liberties have been taken and changed - the characters are all younger, the origin has been drastically changed, the backgrounds of the main four have all changed....it's a mess, really, and all unnecessary.The best way to watch this flick is to think of it as a movie version of the old ""What If?"" Marvel comic series, where they would take some heroes and change something about them and/or their story. So this would be like, ""What If the Human Torch was black? What If Sue was adopted? What if the FF got their powers in a vastly different way?"" And so on.But the ""What If?"" comic was not part of the ""Marvel Comics Universe"" and they made that clear. This film, however, is presented obviously as ""real"" and all the changes again, are extremely disappointing to fans like myself, so you have to watch the film as if it really doesn't ""count."" (Not paying to see it also helps a bit.) With that mindset, it's actually something of an enjoyable B-flick, which kind of runs like an older sci-fi film, with lots of metallic hardware, scummy government guys that want to ""help"" and other typical stuff like other dimensions and the like. The friendship between Reed and Ben is kind of touching (though not nearly explored enough, again, it's a B-movie) and the Sue actress is pretty.But really, there's no doubt that the film is bad. There's only a few minutes of actual ""superhero-ing"" in the entire film, near the end, with the supposed ""big battle"" with Doom. So the movie is virtually action-free. There's so many holes it's like celluloid swiss cheese. And just when the four establish themselves as a team, bang! The movie ends.The Fantastic Four, again, has been part of the lexicon for almost six decades, and even vague superhero fans know what should be there. The film has almost none of what makes the FF great. The heroes are never named, so we don't hear the familiar names we know and love. Heck, the film doesn't even ever say ""Fantastic Four"" in the dialogue. There's no costumes. There's no Fantasticar. There's no classic Human Torch (blond haired/blue eyed handsome hot head) to draw the girls into the theater. There's no relationship ever established between Reed and Sue. No ""cosmic rays in space"" in the origin. No ""Latveria"" for Dr. Doom. And the incredible charm and humanity that made the FF comic usher in a new age of comics, it's all gone. Augh, I could go on.Something else that is greatly missed is New York City. Sure, NYC is where the Baxter Building is, but the city was always a huge part of the Marvel Universe, a character all its own. The FF, The Thing especially, who in the comics was a Lower East Side tough guy who grew up in poverty with a hard edge, but in the film now resides in Oyster Bay, Long Island (!), are ""New York"" but you'd never know that here.I can go on, but you get the drift. Really, all the liberties and changes they made to such a classic team are, to put it mildly, simply disgusting. Given the ending, which obviously assumes a sequel will be made, I am glad this disaster bombed and the planned sequel seems on hold (which usually means it'll never be made).So yes, you really have to watch this (for free if you can) with the expectation that you will be watching a severe and wretched entry in the superhero movie world, and enjoy it on a ""Plan 9"" level. One day, one day, maybe someone will actually make a decent FF film.",Fantastic Four
149,gareth-75442,NOT A MARVEL MOVIE! THIS IS THE WORK OF 20TH CENTURY FOX.,4,6 September 2020,"So to clear a few things up so haters can direct their hatred to the real culprits.""Constantin films"" are the company that own the movie rights to the Fantastic four, they made both the previous Fantastic Four movies, with each movie being released through 20th Century Fox, the parent company, Marvel Studios only had a small consultancy role in all 3 movies which is also the same with all Marvel properties whose cinematic & TV rights are held by other company's.This particular movie was a ""rush job"" with Constantin Films only having 28 days left in which to have the movie finished & released before the rights were legally returned to Marvel Studios.So just to be clear, this movie is a Constantin Films/20th Century Fox release NOT a Marvel Studios release.Unfortunately with a lack of decent writing talent the producers chose to do a reboot of their 2005 movie, big mistake, poor casting choices & lacklustre script together with low budget cgi saw the movie barely break even with its $100 million dollar budget & fall short of the box office takings of both previous movies in 2005 & 2007.Changing the characters was a big risk & a bad mistake, choosing to use a darker retelling of the origin rather than using a new story was a bad mistake, something Sony has learned from with Spiderman, omitting the superhero aspect of the Fantastic Four was a huge mistake, all in all its a watchable film for a straight to video release or a sci-fi channel movie but its full of bad choices & ultimately its a huge mistake.Hopefully once Marvel make room for it in the MCU they will do justice to The Fantastic Four.Fun fact : this is actually the fourth FF movie, with the 1st being a TV movie straight to video release that actually didn't get released, at least I've not been able to find any copy's, there was a screenshot of the cast in full costume that was released.I get that these studios want to do contemporary story's of these characters so they can be brought up to date & be more relevant but there is no need with the Fantastic Four, stick to the original source material, set the origin of these characters in the 60s & build the story from there, stop trying to rewrite these characters for the modern age.",Fantastic Four
150,kevinxirau,Four times the disappointment.,4,10 August 2015,"If I were to be honest, I didn't have that many expectations for this movie beyond hoping that this will be a good adaptation. Previously, the Fantastic 4 had an unreleased Roger Corman film in the 90s, a flawed but still entertaining 2005 film, and a disappointing sequel ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"". Not exactly the best track record for the original superhero family when it comes to films. Then the trailers for this reboot came out and, despite the controversy surrounding things like the Human Torch being played by an African-American, it showed some exceptional promise with the plot, designs, tone, and effects. Considering that 2015 already had ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Ant-Man"" under is wing, the stakes couldn't have been raised any higher for the FF. Sadly, its seems this film has left a hollow impression on me.Plot: Even at a young age, Reed Richards had proved himself to be an ambitious young genius. After he and his best friend Ben Grimm managed to make a working teleportation device, an elderly Dr. Storm approaches him to invite him to join a government-funded think tank to perfect his device to help explore an alternate dimension (presumably the Negative Zone). With the help some Storm's children, Susan and Johnny, and former protégé Victor von Doom, Reed is successful and decides to explore this newfound world with Ben and his newfound friends. However, Doom becomes lost and the four are exposed to unknown energies, thus gaining incredible powers and becoming Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and the Thing. While the guilt-ridden Reed tries to find a way to reverse the effects, the government wastes no time trying to exploit his friends' powers and recreating the device, but that all changes when Doom returns with sinister motives. It is here that the four must unite to save the world.Despite the filmmakers previously claiming that the film is not based on any source material, the story mainly takes elements of the first three volumes of the Ultimate comics, which in itself is a good story, so I was naturally interested to see how they'll translate this into a movie. At first, I was actually liking this movie. The characters were set up nicely, they're for the most part likable even if they're not always best acted, the science and the ideas/applications it presents are great and thoughtful, and even the scene where they all get the powers was a nice and tragic moment. The effects were good, especially with the Thing's well-detailed design, and the Negative Zone's environment had this barren but beautiful look, giving an alien feel. This first third seemed like an ideal set-up for the FF. So what went wrong? Everything after they get their powers! There's a bizarre shift, both in tone and story. There's the subplot about the military wanting to exploit their powers, which appeared fine at first, but not only does it take up the majority of the film, but it lacked presence since there isn't much exploration of this. The characters mostly brood over what's happened to them, which gives the impression that the filmmakers are trying to imitate Batman. Why does Hollywood insist that making superheroes into something dark and edgy like ""The Dark Knight""? Some heroes aren't made for that and even if they are, Batman would just blend into the crowd rather than be a unique character. The FF are essentially super-powered, scientific explorers who get into fun adventures and fight various villains and while I like the new twists to the Four, they don't much to live up to said traits. Heck, the filmmakers didn't even make time to try and build the team dynamic the comics are famous for. Also, I can't remember a single bit of soundtrack in this movie. That's how bad the music was.Furthermore, the climax is a huge letdown. The film keeps trying to build up to some grand finale (and whatever intended sequel) with very little payoff, in part thanks to the brooding. Doom returns at some point of the film, giving a decent amount of menace, having deadly powers and an understandable plan. It's here that the heroes finally decide to do something about it. This is where the film was suppose to be exciting, but unfortunately the film fails even at that. Not only is the action a bit dull, but this whole part of the movie is WAY too rushed and not much fighting actually happens. I also feel that Dr. Doom is becoming almost as overused as the Joker and that a villain like Annihilus would not only be more fitting for this new world the characters discovered but would also be something fresh to see on the big screen.The 2005 film was far from perfect, but it at least knew what kind of material it was working with. The characters were more memorable because of how they interacted with each other, understand the traits/flaws of one another for the most part, and how they grew together as a family. The lighter tone was ideal, the effects good at the time, and the action fun. Granted, while not much happens in the middle of that film, it made up for it with a thrilling, lengthy battle against Dr. Doom, who was entertaining to watch despite a weak motivation. This reboot fails at all of that with the only remotely good character being Dr. Storm, who was heartfelt and a nice mentor figure.It pains me to say this, but this is not a good year for the Fantastic 4. This reboot suffers very little action, terrible tone shift, brooding characters, short climax, lack of memorable score, and poor direction. A bunch of great ideas were presented, but the film lives up to the term ""wasted potential"". Appropriately, I give this 2015 adaptation a 4 out of 10.",Fantastic Four

It's just that the writers have failed to provide our heroes with a story that we care about, they haven't created a villain worthy of booing, they haven't created a scenario that has us on the edge of our seats and that we can relate to. Worst of all, they have failed to provide us with heroes we care about and want to cheer for.It's obvious that this movie was planned to be only the first in a franchise and, as such, it's fairly obligatory to include an origin story. Perhaps the failings of this movie would have been rectified in the sequels. Sadly, this movie is done so poorly that I suspect that this will be the last time we see The Fantastic Four on the screen until someone decides to, once again, do a complete reboot.Finally, this movie errs by being pandering to politically correctness. I hate it when writers change established canon by altering a well-known character's gender, race, sexual persuasion or, in fact, any other personal attributes just to score on the politically correct meter. Please don't play with our memories like that.Thankfully, this movies is just over 90 minutes long. Maybe if it was longer - as most similar movies are - it would have had time to remedy some of the things I have complained about. Somehow, I think not.",Fantastic Four
152,Spideyfan-963-246215,Fantastic Four(2015) Review,1,9 September 2016,"Fantastic Four(2015) Starring: Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell, Tim Blake Nelson, Reg E. Cathey, Chet Hanks, and Tim Heidecker Directed By: Josh Trank Review CHANGE IS COMING. When I was a little boy around the time when I saw Spider- Man the movie from 2002 I also watched the 90s cartoon of Spider-Man on Jetex. Along with two other Marvel properties The Incredible Hulk cartoon and Fantastic Four. I was a big fan of that show I haven't seen it in a long time. But when they made the 2005 movie and I saw the trailer on the official website of the movie I got excited, saw the movie and I loved it as a kid and I still do. The sequel however the only good thing I could say for it at the time was Laurence Fishburne. I mean I know it was kind of hard to make a fantastic four movie with Galactus but ugh I just couldn't fathom what they did to him. Comic book movies are booming these days and it's a damn shame that this is the most recent entire to Marvel's first family. I like the 2005 movie but it's doesn't feel as Fantastic as the cartoon did. I have three perfect Spider-Man movies, I have five perfect Batman movie, I have four perfect Superman movies, I have three perfect X- Men movies, I have at least one perfect Hulk movie. But not one for Marvel's first family. What the hell?! Four young outsiders teleport to a dangerous universe, which alters their physical form in shocking ways. Their lives irrevocably upended, the team must learn to harness their daunting new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. They use their origins from the Ultimate line of comics and you know something Kate Mara was actually going to read the comics to learn about her character but a FOX executive said ""No don't worry where going to use only the origin from the ultimate line, not any of the character aspect"" yeah actors who want to be in comic book movies if a studio executive says that to you get out of the project because they're not like Kevin Feige where they are a walking encyclopedia on Marvel or a person who gives a crap about the movie, if they don't care why should you. In this movie their is a scene where Reed Richards one of the smartest minds in the Marvel universe who while may take an obsession in his work abandons Ben, Sue, and Johnny in the facility where they are being kept. Reed would never do that especially to Sue or Ben! Victor Von Doom one of Marvels most feared and powerful villains looks like absolute crap! His character is absolutely horrible as well he's an emo punk who's a stalker for Sue. But the thing that really grinds about this movie is the one thing that they had in the Tim Story movies they completely ignored in this film, do you want to know what makes the Fantastic Four standout in the Marvel universe aside from their villains, forget their villains for a minute, the most important thing they forgot about the fantastic four is............. THEY ARE A FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SCREW THIS MOVIE,IT IS THE WORST COMIC BOOK MOVIE AND ADAPTION I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!!!!",Fantastic Four
153,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"Better than the 2005 version, still a long way to go",6,8 August 2015,"Spoilers below...So I didn't hate it as much as some critics seemed too. But, I do think the script could have been better. For instance, it's kind of ridiculous that Victor was allowed back on the program after setting fire to one of Franklin's labs. Also, its pretty ridiculous how Johnny becomes part of the program as well. We don't really know much of his backstory (besides that he likes to street race). Like is there any reason the government would allow Johnny in on the project just solely based off his dad's word that ""he can build anything""? Are there no other scientists that could help? Also, the last 30 min or so is pretty messy in general. Reed has been on the run for a year and once he's been back for all of 20 minutes, he magically seems to fix the issue of re-opening the gate. It's just a bit too convenient. Also, while I liked the battle taking place on another planet (more fresher than Earth), the battle itself was a little lame. I felt like Victor got defeated a little too easily. And I also didn't like that we didn't get to see much of them as a team. Hell, I don't think we ever see Sue and Ben have a conversation. Also, while the special effects are better than the 2005 version, they still look fake. Reed's stretching powers and even Sue's forcefield ball that they float in. Also there was no Stan Lee cameo and you just don't F around with Stan Lee cameos.I did like the darker tone. I liked that it wasn't as cheesy as the 2005 version. Like, it didn't need Johnny making a billion jokes about how hot he was. Or anything like that. I also thought it was more believable when they get these powers that the military locks them away and uses them for their purposes. I feel like thats what would actually happen in real life. I thought the whole sequence where Victor walks down the corridor and melts people's brains was pretty bad-ass. And I also really liked that they put scars on young Reed to match Miles Teller. I liked little details like that. So it certainly wasn't the worst thing in the world, and I did enjoy it more than the 2005 version, but it could have been improved on.",Fantastic Four
154,CleveMan66,"""Fantastic Four"" is anything but.",2,8 August 2015,"The early 1960s was a pivotal time for Marvel Comics and ""The Fantastic Four"" was a big part of that. In 1961, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby both created an image, a personality and a system of collaborative comic development (the ""Marvel Method"") which became standard for Marvel. These big changes came about as Lee and Kirby developed ""The Fantastic Four"" (although which of these men deserves more of the credit for FF is still in dispute over 50 years later). Invented in response to the popularity of the ""Justice League of America"" superhero team at DC Comics (at the time called National Periodical Publications), ""Fantastic Four"" developed with unusual characteristics for a superhero team. This group of three men and one woman were ordinary people who each simultaneously gained their own extraordinary powers due to radiation exposure. Unlike other superheroes (including the Justice League), Fantastic Four don't have hideouts or secret identities and were a team from the beginning, but a team made up of flawed individuals who argue, hold grudges and have trouble working together. In all this, they're like a family, which makes them more relatable and likely contributes to the popularity of their series of adventures.""Fantastic Four"" (PG-13, 1:40) is a reboot following the perceived disappointing performance of the 2005 and 2007 films about the superhero team. (I guess $619 million in worldwide grosses doesn't buy what it used to.) As a reboot, this version has a completely new cast (so long, Jessica Alba and company) and, of course serves as another origin story. It IS original, but it really isn't much of a story.The central character and eventual de facto leader of the Fantastic Four is Reed Richards (Miles Teller). As a child, he invented a teleportation machine in his parents' garage with the help of his best friend, Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell). The device works, but Reed and Ben aren't sure where it sends the objects that they're able to make disappear (and firing the thing up also blacks out an entire city block). Later, as high school seniors, they demonstrate the latest version of the machine at a science fair. They've learned to bring objects back (with the only casualty being a basketball backboard), but the guys still don't know where these objects go. Nevertheless, their invention attracts the attention of Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter, Susan (Kate Mara). Doctor Storm invites Reed to work with him and Susan at the Baxter Foundation, where they're working on a larger version of Reed's machine. They're all soon joined by Storm's brilliant, but selfish and aloof protégé, Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell), and Storm's rebellious son, Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), all working for Dr. Harvey Allen (Tim Blake Nelson). Storm convinces Dr. Allen and the rest of the Baxter team that this group of ""kids"" (as he calls them) are the ones to finally make their machine (the ""Quantum Gate"") work and make everyone lots of money.Of course, this group does make the machine work. They successfully send a chimpanzee to what turns out to be a parallel dimension and they bring him back safe and sound. Since this new-found place looks on their cameras like some other planet (and they're all hoping to find new sources of energy there), Allen wants to call in NASA to take over the project. The guys get drunk and decide that they deserve to be the first humans to try out the machine. Reed calls in his long-time partner, Ben, to join him, Johnny and Victor on their brief but incredible voyage. While tentatively exploring this newly-discovered dimension, they do find a new source of energy, but it promptly begins exploding out of the ground and comes after them. One of them falls into the glowing green goop and the others barely make it back, with the help of Sue, whom they left in the rear with the gear. This ill-advised mission ends with all of them, including Sue, overdosing on radiation and each developing different superhero-like powers. Now they have to learn to harness abilities like stretching the human body to freaky new dimensions, becoming invisible and creating powerful energy shields, transforming into a human torch and becoming a super-strong hulking pile of rocks. Naturally, their ultimate goal is to figure out how to reverse these mutations, but the Baxter Foundation has other ideas, as does a powerful evil force that this gang of four unwittingly unleashes on our beloved three-dimensional earth.""Fantastic Four"" isn't. Although the movie puts much of the Fantastic Four folklore on display and does so with creative aplomb, the end result is kind of a mess. The script is practically non-sensical when it comes to the setting (a parallel dimension that looks like earth from billions of years ago?) to the reasoning for exploration (just assuming that this new dimension will yield new energy sources??) to Dr. Stone's assurances (with all the brilliant scientific minds on the planet, all he needs for his project are a bunch of overachieving teens and 20-somethings???)! Besides all that (and more – I could go on and on), this movie features probably the least-charismatic, least-believable cast ever assembled for a superhero movie and puts them through their paces in about the least-inspiring way imaginable. Not only is ""Fantastic Four"", Version 2015, decidedly un-fantastic, it's barely passable as entertainment. ""C-""",Fantastic Four

156,santiagocosme,Fantastic? Rather rubbish four.,2,10 December 2016,"I mean I don't know. I guess there's an age when these movies make no sense to watch. I just turned 40 and as a kid I used to read the Fantastic four adventures, spiderman, Ironman, Captain America, and more. Marvel was really something I adored. Unfortunately, when I watch it now, and I see the actors that play the characters, the lack of charisma they all have, I am made to wonder whether they should have ever bothered to turn Marvel characters into movie heroes. Captain America the movie is a disgrace, Ironman is worth less than my shirt, Fantastic four is so absurd and silly that you are made to wonder if the intention was to create a comedy. The characters are rubbish, the actors are rubbish, the whole thing is rubbish. First and last time I watch Marvel movies. This is an absolute insult to comic fans. If it wasn't because I watched it at my friend's place, I'd ask for my money back.",Fantastic Four

The CGI is terrible like The Thing look like KFC chicken, and when Mr. Fantastic stretches, it looks very rubbery. I feel bad for the cast, they don't deserve to be in this movie. This is way worse then Batman & Robin (1997) and Elektra (2005). This movie is so lifeless and boring. The re shots are awful like Fox try to pretend this is the real deal even though it looks terrible.I'm glad I skip this movie in theaters.This movie is poorly written and god awful plot.

161,kenyae-cagle,Michael B Jordan made the movie good,5,12 August 2015,"Well, the movie was pretty good and enjoyable at certain points. I was actually surprised to see that Kate Mara did not die in this movie or was not having sex in this movie. The acting by everyone was okay, but Michael B Jordan was a great human torch and made the movie very enjoyable for me. I loved everything he did in the movie. I thought the thing was a terrible character because he kept asking Reed for help every part of the movie and that seemed kinda weak of the thing. Invisible Woman could've needed help because the way the story between her and Reed was developed seemed kind of rushed and the story line could have taken its time. I like the fact that they basically did the story of how they all got their powers, but the story line should have been developed better. Finally, with Doom, Doom needed a lot more character development and showing more of his jealous side which then turned him into hating Reed. And the fact that Doom was beaten within a few minutes bothered me because he is such a stronger enemy than what the movie showed.",Fantastic Four
162,headly66,Fantastic Faux,2,9 August 2015,"I'm not really going to review this movie since it is not a movie about the FF.It a science fiction superhero movie about some characters who vaguely resemble the FF.The backstories of all the characters are completely different from the origin stories from the Marvel comics issues they were told in.The Human Torch is black for some unknown reason and the Invisible Girl was adopted from Kosovo.(In the comics they are both white, both grew up in the town of Glenville, Long Island)The Storm sibling's father was never a scientist he was a doctor who is in jail for an accidental murder.Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards) was a boy genius whose father was a scientist too, not a guy who wished he was adopted, and he was not discovered at a science fair, he enter college at 14 and had several degrees in the sciences by age 20. And he is a father figure and in his 40's in the comics.Ben Grimm was born on Yancy Street in New York City's Lower East Side, to a Jewish family. He didn't go to grammar school with Reed who grew up in CA. And was not just some little guy, he was a sports star, an engineer, a Marine, and a test pilot for the Air Force.Dr Doom's origin is all BS.

163,abouhelier-r,Fantastic Four,5,9 August 2015,"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways. The four must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. Fantastic Four is the 20th Century Fox reboot of the Fantastic Four film franchise (2005-2007) that many would agree was not that good - but so horribly fun. This is ironically the fourth Fantastic Four movie and the second (technically third) stab at Fantastic Four, which comes just eight years after the first try and its sequel. Which didn't really set the bar inordinately high. Based on the oldest Marvel comic titles, this inherited property feels less like a blockbuster in this age of comics-oriented productions. This film isn't an embarrassment but a wrong experiment. Although, disappointingly this new adaptation isn't that much better than the previous one. They barely drew from a different source to reimagine the quartet's origins, without even improving them. Moreover, the cast is significantly younger. The heart and soul of the original comics were part of the interaction between each character. From Ben's depression at having become a ""monster"" to the budding relationship between Reed and Sue, to Johnny and Ben's squabbling. Those things didn't even slightly emerged. Central characters are mostly gazing intently into computer screen throughout the major part of the movie. There's no clear development to Victor's drastic transformation into the powerful villain. It felt that Victor was a better character before he becomes Dr.Doom. Technically, the look has slightly improved. Starting with the Thing who picks up computer-generated size, muscle and menace which might have lacked in the former incarnation. As for the costumes, they are built for utility only. Film goers are treated with a lot of science, that, I'm not complaining about, I always liked good theories. CGI is not convincing at all though. Even the green screens are laughable. Not one of the extraterrestrial scenes are believable, like this world might exists somewhere. Nothing really happen, it's long and boring. This movie displays a bunch of people trying to make something and then they get powers, but don't really use them so nothing's happening still. Alas, it takes a long time before anyone gets around to smash much of anything. And because it's hardly a mystery the heroes will end up facing off with Doom, there's a sense of killing time in the early going that's not adequately compensated for by the action sequences and especially the ""big"" finale. Where many recent superhero movies have risked overstaying their welcome, Fantastic Four, at 100 minutes has a slow initial pace, climax probably should have come at least half an hour sooner and the end feels a little bit rushed. Don't expect a lot of action as the film takes most of its time with exposition and development from the very beginning. In fact, this film is one giant exposition. There isn't one single memorably cool moment in the movie that people would talk about.Director Josh Trank sharing script credit with producer Simon Keborg (veteran of the X-Men franchise) and Jeremy Slater go way back into the group's past this time around. Plus, the script made major changes to the origin story which immediately distinguishes itself from the previous adaptations, with a seriousness of tone and a near-absence of humour, horrid dialogues and predictable moments, all accumulated have ruined the potential this film had. The final third and the last scene are so suddenly cheesy, I cringed. The collaboration of Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass also yields some intriguing riffs in what ultimately sounds like a pretty conventional score. Finally, they made a movie to set up another movie. Producers no longer intend to make good movies on their own. I genuinely never thought to this day to see a superhero movie that is that bad. There's no post-credit scene as it's probably not tied to the MCU. Overall, I really wanted so bad to love this movie but the entire run time is exposition. This movie feels like a teaser for a more exciting follow up that might never happen. The cast is all very talented and do their best to make this believable. What the heck happened?",Fantastic Four

165,stephendaxter,"Fantastic 4, without the Fantastic 4",4,6 August 2015,"FANT4STIC......... Was that supposed to be a Fantastic 4 film? Because i'm pretty sure what i just witnessed was not even 15 minutes of a Fantastic 4 film accompanied by an hour and a half of crap, and not even the kind of crap you can enjoy, just pure ""i can't believe someone thought this was good"" kind of crap. And that is exactly what i was thinking to myself for 90% of this movie, as i sighed and face-palmed in disbelief that someone could get that so bloody wrong. Also, that 15 minutes was still not that good, but was a small step up from the rest. It was incredibly boring and dragged on and on and on until it got to the point where i didn't care what happened in the rest of the film, i just wanted it to be over and to forget about it. And i was actually looking forward to it and was somewhat slightly optimistic that it could be good, and i couldn't be more wrong.It showed a couple of signs early on that it just maybe would start to get good, but whenever it started going in the right direction, it turned around and headed astray. The writers focused an incredible amount of time setting up the characters and their relationships to the point where it became exhausting and boring fairly quickly. Well at least the time they spent focusing on the characters kind of helped later in the film right? WRONG! The actors i liked as their characters, i thought they made interesting characters with personalities that for the most part fit pretty well, but they only needed brief introductions. The interactions and relationships between the characters seemed fake or almost non-existent, except for the relationship between Reed Richards and Benn Grimm, it was the only one i was actually invested in, and the only one the film really focused on. And considering they spent so much damn time on building relationships in the first 3/4 of the film for absolutely no worthwhile outcome was a huge let-down. Now, Victor..... Von........ Doom, more like Victor Von WHO? This was a completely wasted villain who was just incredibly awful. He was so bad i would put him in the same league as the version of 'Deadpool' from 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. And i don't even want to talk about his design, i was one of those people who wasn't annoyed by his appearance in the trailers, I remained optimistic and wanted to believe that in the film i may actually like the look. But i cannot believe how wrong i was, because he looked hilariously dumb and i could not at all take him seriously. So to avoid spoilers, that is all i will say about him.After witnessing this crap i can see that this film was definitely ONLY made to ensure that Fox kept the rights for these characters from Marvel. So in the end, Michael B. Jordan, Miles Teller, Jamie Bell, Kate Mara, and Toby Kebbell definitely weren't the problems, it was the totally crap writing that reduced this movie to nothing. So yeah, do yourself a favour and skip this one. - 4/10",Fantastic Four
166,lnvicta,"A strong cast and an effective first two acts brought down by a rushed, half-hearted ending.",4,15 August 2015,"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie at all. I was a huge skeptic when the first trailer came out thinking it would be another FF movie chock full of cheesy one-liners and cartoony humor. In that respect, I was way off. Josh Trank's Fantastic Four is grounded in relative realism, showing what would likely happen if people did in fact crack inter-dimensional travel and brought back superpowers. It has a darker tone than the other movies and is a wildly different experience because of it. The characters are more relatable, their situations are more believable, and for a good part of the movie, it actually feels like you're watching the true Fantastic Four origin story unfold.I can't blame Trank for the discrepancies I have with the movie because he is not at fault. Apparently the producers demanded reshoots which rear their ugly head about 20 minutes from the end. It turns from this relatively dark, stylish superhero drama to an overblown one-liner infested CGI-fest. Mind you, I was still pulling for the heroes the entire time, but the moments following, preceding and including the final confrontation are so forcefully rushed and haphazardly put together it completely disconnects you from what the first hour of the movie set-up. The climax is generic and lackluster, and the believable shaky chemistry the characters shared in the beginning of the movie becomes incredibly forced and awkward. The shift is so drastic it's as if they Frankenstein'd two separate movies together, making for one extremely disjointed watching experience.Miles Teller and the rest of the cast have the benefit of being immensely likable. They worked well together and had palpable chemistry for a good chunk of the movie. Even Doom was fine. Once I got past the fact that it wasn't the comic book's adaptation of ""Doctor Doom"" and took him at face value as a sci-fi villain, I thought he worked wonders and actually posed a genuine threat to humanity. The CGI as a whole is great - a few moments will leave you scratching your head as in ""was that really necessary?"" but for the most part, the alternate dimension looks fantastic and the few fight scenes there are (literally only two or three) are executed well.Again, these are simply hints of what the movie could've been. It's obvious Trank had a vision with this world, and it's a damn shame that we won't be able to see it in full effect. What we're left with is a promising set-up and a complete mess of a third act with potential bleeding out right up until the final frames. Fantastic Four is more realistic and immersive than the other two adaptations, but unfortunately not as fun as either. What we're left with is an exercise in ""what could have been"" and another superhero movie with promising aspects that simply did not click.",Fantastic Four
167,SpoilerAlertReviews,Not so fantastic...,5,7 August 2015,"Really isn't fantastic, more so average, but why? It seems this series of marvel characters always have a hard time being on the big screen. Is it the actually film and film making itself or is it the characters and plot leading me to debate, if Joss Whedon did the movie would it be any better? Could it be that the powers these characters possess are kinda insignificant when compared the rest of the marvel universe? The background story isn't exactly fantastic either and it can't be easy trying to make a movie with four main characters. It only works with Avengers because we got introduced to each character individually before them uniting. I enjoyed Josh Trank's chronicle and you can see the same gritty darkness emitting here in this Fantastic Four. But I don't think this, or any of the previous F4 films for that matter have been well casted. I like Miles Teller, especially his Whiplash performance and I'm a massive Toby Kebbell fan because of Dead Man's Shoes and Rocknrolla. Even his smaller, sillier roles make me enjoy a movie more. But both roles here aren't amazing. The rest of the cast, okay but that's all. Again I don't think there's anything the audience can relate to or feel anything with these characters. They're not anymore likable as heroes then when they were before they had super powers. It's like they wanted to make the characters geeky scientists that have had a rough time being kids in hope to earn the audience's empathy. They did try very well to get this human element across, the friendship bond between Grimm and Reed, and the parental/sibling struggle between the Storms, mix that with Doom's unworthy ambition that manifests into home world destruction and you have a fantastic mess. Kate Mara I think has a face that'll suit the next Planet of the Apes movie, no offence, but she does. Bad call on using CGI over prosthetics for Grimm's Thing, yet it looks like they used toilet roll tubes and green LEDs to portray Doom. Who could have been, should have been such a bad ass and instead give him Vader like powers. And Michael B. Jordan seems to lack the flare Chris Evans had in the previous ones. (Pun intended). Reg E. Cathey's voice is amazing though, he sounds like a transformer! His voice would be perfect for Soundwave! The plot line isn't new nor is it interesting, and the beginning felt more like a remake of Explorers, (no they shouldn't, or could they? Love that movie) Reed being River Phoenix's Wolfgang and Grimm being Darren Woods. Then it turns into Space Camp! They breach another otherworldly dimension, upset the planet's chemistry and pay the consequences returning to Earth as US military experiments. You don't see much superhero action, even at this stage. And The Thing's action is seen mainly second hand from a monitor. The thing is a bit of a whinge bag of stones, think sadsack but as a rock. He wines ""help me"" more times than saying ""it's clobbering time"". Plus he doesn't wear any pants. And what's with that force field!? Again, Explorers! It felt like a cheap shot with them flying around in it as an escape pod that ripped off Stark's reentry in Avengers Assemble. It's a let down but with the bad press going about, it was expected. As Sue Storm would say, there's a pattern here. There is no Stan Lee cameo, and no sneaky extra scene hinting at a sequel which isn't a bad thing. Leave it as the only one, not a terrible two. The not so Fantastic Four.",Fantastic Four
168,caseynicholson,Definitely Better Than the Reviews!,7,14 August 2015,"I never got the hate for the Fantastic Four franchise in the mid-2000's and I don't get the hate for this latest movie. I had read somewhere that this may be the worst superhero movie of all time. Clearly that person has never seen the theatrical release of ""Daredevil"", or ""Batman & Robin"", and certainly not ""The Spirit"".This latest incarnation of the Fantastic Four does take a markedly different approach than the previous duo of films. Gone altogether are the lighthearted banter that made the previous series more of a comic book movie with the emphasis on the word ""comic"". Instead, here we find a much darker, grittier movie, but one that that can only be said for in comparison to its predecessors. This isn't a horror film by any stretch (that scene with Doom walking through the hallway being the lone exception). But it is an attempt to retell the Fantastic Four story with a more mature vibe. In the comics world this would translate to the difference between the FF of the Stan Lee era (which the previous series was heavily based around) to the Ultimates universe (Marvel's comic line of re-envisioned story lines for the new millennium). The writing isn't hokey but is instead a serious take on a traditionally fun, lighthearted group.This reimagining is not completely without its problems. The interdimensional travel works for the film, but just barely, and it certainly was a bold step to conceive Doom the way that this film has done. By the same token, though, it's nearly impossible to portray Dr. Doom on the big screen via standard imagery without making him look odd. Doom's metal suit just doesn't carry over well into real life storytelling. The new incarnation takes some getting used to, but it's not that terrible of a concept.The thing that I was most impressed by with this movie, though, is the pacing and the complete and thorough storytelling that is extant in the film. Usually when a movie like this gets bad reviews, it's because it has failed to tell its story well (""Daredevil"" and ""The Spirit"" are both good examples of that). I'm happy to report that that is really not the case here, as the 2015 Fantastic Four movie does well in the storytelling department.That being the case, I'm going to give this movie 7/10 stars. Was it as dynamic as other superhero movies in its class? No, it missed the mark, just slightly, of being exceptional. And I would indeed go so far as to say that I do prefer to the mid-2000's films over this one. But it's a far cry from being a ""bad"" movie.",Fantastic Four
169,metalrage666,Not as fantastic as it should've been,1,6 August 2015,"What the hell have they done to my beloved Fantastic Four?! When I first heard that they were re-booting the franchise, I felt back then that this was somehow going to have moderately improved special effects and a definitely diminished storyline. Sadly I was not proved wrong. This movie is not only garbage and a total waste of effort, it's a huge slap in the face of everything the Fantastic Four ever were or stood for. I surprised myself that I didn't just get up and storm out of the theatre.Fans of the superhero movies will see this as just another movie, fans of the Fantastic Four comics and cartoons, will most likely side with me and this review and hate this, seeing it as a homogenised and castrated version of what the superhero quartet should be. And despite the cheesy 2005 movie, it was still a far more enjoyable outing than this disjointed and offensive effort.Based on what I read, director Josh Trank was determined to not make a movie that was in any way respectful of the old comics or cartoons and as such that ""Michael Bay-esque"" decision will most likely come back to haunt him forever. And I hope it does. No good ever comes from meddling with what audiences and/or fans really wish or expect to see and there are numerous reports of Trank's erratic behaviour on set. Having said that, I have also read that Trank wanted a different version than what we ended up seeing, and the result was yet more unnecessary studio interference that just can't leave well enough alone. Regardless of which version is the more accurate one, this flick is only fit for burning.The original Fantastic Four gained their powers through cosmic rays during a scientific mission to space; in this new version they got their powers after some kind of drunken cowboy stunt to an alternate dimension, that they weren't even supposed to go on. Sue Storm, AKA Invisible Woman, didn't even go with them, she just happened to get some of the fallout from the alien world when the guys returned from their impromptu journey to God-knows- where.I don't know why they had to make Johnny Storm, AKA the Human Torch African-American. He never was in any version of the Fantastic Four that I've ever seen. He and Sue are supposed to be brother and sister, so why the half-arsed political correctness trying to keep over-sensitive people happy? Is having an all-white superhero cast too much for audiences these days? And having Sue as an adopted sister may explain the mis-match but it doesn't explain the obscure necessity to change the dynamic.The Victor von Doom character turns out to be nothing more than a self- destructive emo-styled eco-warrior that turns into Doctor Doom while being stranded and understandably left for dead on this alternate world they ventured to. He displayed no real sense of the perfectionism that the Victor character had always prided himself on and his transformation resulted from a kind of fusion of his spacesuit and his own body after he was enveloped by a weird green alien liquid.Overall this movie was just a mediocre attempt at trying to cash in on the overwhelming superhero franchises that are doing the rounds, knowing that audiences will flock to the theatre in droves just to see the latest Marvel installment. The movie takes quite a while to get going and just when it starts to pick up, it's suddenly over. It dwells too much on drawn out pre-history of when Reed Richards and Ben Grimm were kids and then seniors in high school. It then draws out even further in building the device that ends up sending them to an alternate world. All the action takes place in the last 30 minutes. At only 100 minutes long, it's certainly not long enough to get audiences bogged down in useless back story. I'll never understand the insatiable need that directors and studios seem to have in wanting to steer away from what the story is supposed to be about. Fantastic Four is anything but fantastic and I still prefer the 2005 version than this slow- paced and derivative version. And don't bother hanging around at the end of the film as there is no additional footage after the credits have rolled, (as has been the case in nearly every other Marvel movie) so you'll just be wasting your time; actually you're wasting your time sitting through this at all.",Fantastic Four
170,palavitsinis,"It's a fantastic 7, marginally, but a good movie!",7,2 November 2015,"It's more of a 6.5 for me, but I really had some fun watching it, so I will be generous with a ""7"" here! I also took a look at the previous one, which came out in the distant 2005! Seemed less time to me, but it's been ten years already! The old one was 5.7 out of 10, which is still too low I think. I would definitely give a 6.5 in the old one as well! The old one did have Jessica Alba and Chris Evans, so comparison falls short on the cast side!Anyways, bottom line is that if you liked the old one, you will like this one as well, maybe a bit more. This one is closer to my taste, although the Fantastic Four seem younger than their actual age in the comics. I did like the fact that it was kind of darker than the previous one and that it pointed out the emotional roller-coaster and distress of acquiring their powers, whereas in the previous one it was more like ""yeah, we have powers, let's be cool and kick ass"". I really don't get all these people that sit down and compare what was in the comic and what was in the movie, etc, failing to understand that it's not the director's job to transfer the entire comic in the movie, or to attempt to understand what they pictured in their minds when they read the comic and then make a movie with it! For God's sake! It's a fair movie, with nice action and interesting storyline and that's it. It's a marvel movie, it's promising that a sequel will come and that's all I need! It's not X-Men and it will never be, cause it's a different type of movie. On the same topic, it's not spider man, it's not superman, etc. It was an improvement (makes sense) to the poor special effects of 2005, and yes, I liked all the actors! Can't wait to see the next one, I hope not in 2025!",Fantastic Four
171,elenaphysics,I can not believe this,5,23 May 2019,"I have watched the other two fantastic four movies with jessica alba. They were far from great. But they were decent sci-fi/action movies.
This is not.
Let me start with the fact that the movie deserves less than 5 stars, the only reason I did not chose to put 1 or 2 stars is because at least it is watchable(even though it is awfully boring) and it is not hideous (lately many movies are hideous), so I supported it a little bit.
This is a kids movie (except from some deaths) . It is boring, predictable, simple.
Bad direction,boring dialogues, pointless. The acting is horrible.
I can not even consider it a movie. It is like kids theatre act.
It is the first time in my life that I have seen a superhero movie and could not keep my eyes open. I felt sleepy all the time because it was BORING.
But keep in mind that at least it is watchable, nothing disgusting happens, nothing upsetting happens. It is like a kid's perception about quantum physics.
It is innocent. That is why I am not so hard on this movie despite the absence of essence.",Fantastic Four
172,autisticreviewers,Meh...,5,6 August 2015,"This movie is exactly what we had all expected...stupid, dumb and just not following the comic book franchise at all! However, it's not all as bad as you think.Everybody was extremely well casted. Especially Kate Mara, who was way better than Jessica Biel as Susan Storm. The whole cast was actually, surprisingly great. The real problem we have here is that all of the characters have been changed around. As an example, Johnny and Susan are both adopted, one is black and the other is white. That's not how it was in the comics. Another example being that Dr. Doom was a computer nerd/wizard in this movie. In the comics he was a very rich billionaire who loved power.Not much action is used in the movie. We see a few little snippets of them all in action, but most of the slow pace and action is all built for the final showdown between Doom and The Fantastic 4. Was it worth it? Well, we would say only JUST WORTH IT! It's not as bad as people make it out to be, but it's far from great. Apparently they are already making a sequel to this one. Well, if they keep all the cast, it may be all okay, but A lot of changes need to be made! We give this a 5/10. It's bearable to watch! -Autistic Reviewers Check us out on facebook!",Fantastic Four
173,morganstephens512,Awful,1,19 September 2017,"Okay I will say right away that this is the worst comic book movie I've ever seen. Yes Batman and Robin is better than this. But that is not the important thing. I have to explain why this is number one. A lot of people were complaining about how young the cast was and how they were too young. Compared to the ages in this movie, which was high school age, the actors were actually too old for the characters. Which is just the bottom of the barrel on how bad this movie is. The first ten or so minutes were okay and tolerable because it was showing the back story of Reed and Ben as kids and it didn't feel forced. But trust me when I saw that is the only good part. To all those Fantastic Four fans, does it feel like they screwed up Johnny's age up REALLY BAD? He's Susan's younger brother in the comics, but in this movie, it seems like he might actually be OLDER than her! Why is this the case. Reed is a major jerk, unlike the comics. For just leaving the group after he got his powers with no warning just to be on his own. Von Doom, oh if you knew how much you would be screwed up here. In the comics and even 2005 film (which is a classic compared to this), he had a mask. His body wasn't metal. He just happened to wear a metal mask. And he seems really overpowered in this movie for no reason besides to give the heroes a 'challenge.' And the group wins the final battle in THREE MINUTES! No buildup, no conflict, no stress, no development. Just a fight and win. So nice for you to throw in Susan and Johnny's dad just to kill him off at the end so Von Doom can be all like 'I'm so serious, you can't beat me.' There is no character development. Just people who get angry but then make amends with everybody in time for the final battle just to kick butt. Like Ben should be mad that Reed was sort of responsible for him being the Thing. And he was for two minutes but gets over it in time for the final battle. Johnny only was involved with the project because he wanted his car back. A plot device that is NEVER expanded on. He just becomes a hero. Doesn't even mention the car at the end of the movie or any other time. When you start a plot thread, you stay with it. That is story writing basic step 1.I just can't on with this anymore. This makes Batman and Robin, Green Lantern, Supergirl, Elektra, 1990 Captain America all look like Oscars winners. Go watch the 2005 Fantastic Four film. This film makes me realize just how underrated that film is. At least that film tried to have the spirit of the comics. Which is more than I can say for this. Never make a movie out of Fantastic Four again. This if proof that it can't be done.",Fantastic Four
174,chandean-69762,Fantastic Four 2015 Review,1,11 February 2021,"I no longer have any brain activity or any inkling of life left in my body. That's also how everybody in this film probably felt, there is absolutely no sense of emotion, or even the slightest hint that the actors / actresses even wanted to be there. The whole film feels lifeless. The last 30 minutes were extremely rushed and felt like it only happened because they had no idea what to do with this story. The characters are a total bore, the casting is terrible, the score feels almost nonexistent it's so dull, the visuals are confusing and at times off-putting, and the script is horrendous. Everything in this movie is just bad. Save yourself some time and skip this film entirely.",Fantastic Four
175,paul_3-960-896774,The frustrating one,4,11 August 2015,"I heard the rumors and read the reviews about this film but it only made me want to see it for myself. I know, I'm a bit of a masochist. Turns out Fox's new Fantastic Four is incredibly frustrating. The movie had a lot of things going for it. The cast is incredible, they might not have been the ones I would have pictures in these roles, but they are still talented and interesting actors. The way they approached the characters and their relationships was also interesting and it sort of made sense to me. The fact that they were all outsiders in their own way, them being wickedly smart and kind of awkward was an idea that I could have lived with. There's also the ""scaryish"" elements in the movie that I liked. It felt like they were monsters, they were strange, and all of these ideas were potentially good ones but the execution was botched.The pace was so F-ing slow for two third of the movie, and once there's a little bit of action it ends. At times it was obvious that some scenes were cut short, some bits of dialogues annoyed the hell out me. Fox had all of the right ingredients to make an awesome movie but they sorely missed. If we look at the bright, among other things, you can use this movie showcase the importance of editing. @wornoutspines",Fantastic Four
176,justinwfirestone,"Pretty lame plot, boring, but at least only 100 minutes",3,8 August 2015,"This Fantastic Four reboot origin story is pretty bad. It's not awful, but it is close to unwatchable, and far less entertaining than the heavily reviled Pixels. At least it has the decency to keep itself to 100 minutes and forego a false ending.Note to future scientists: DO NOT work on an inter-dimensional travel gate with anyone whose last name is VON DOOM, especially after he gets his advanced degree and (spoiler alert) becomes DR. DOOM. But as with many of the other summer movies, the real villain is reckless pursuit of science.Most other critics have noticed that the main cast is certainly capable and the acting is fine, but boyoboyoboy, manomanoman is this plot a dud. With a thud. And you know Tim Blake Nelson plays a bad guy because he chews gum with is mouth open, and with great affectation, possibly an acting skill he learned from his junior high drama teacher.The movie is about 80% boring and lame setup, then a reckless drunken trip to Planet Zero, and then a final act which is sudden and innocuous. The movie is shot with a really dark blue look, and that sets the tone of depression and malaise.It starts with a search for a power converter, and ends with everything being fantastic. Sue Storm is cold but she loves Portishead and is really good at pattern recognition. Apparently none of the patterns she can see raise any red flags about working with a creepy guy with attachment issues named VON DOOM.The origin story includes welding and screwing and bolting and tweaking source code. Oh, and there's a really exciting moment when Reed Richards spins in an office chair and takes a selfie (spoiler alert) of himself. And remember your really cool sunglasses when you're in the lab, because inter-dimensional travel is really bright. Personally, I would just look away.Here's the real spoiler alert: how they get their superpowers is pretty lame, just a simple throwback to The Fly and the Brundlefly. They return to Earth, but the rock guy does so with rocks, the flame guy does so with fire, the plastic guy does so with, um, Silly Putty (I guess), VON DOOM does not return but instead fuses with his suit and the Planet Zero, and somehow their return causes Sue (who never went to Planet Zero) to fuse with a force field and an invisible hat (I guess). This all happens just after a healthy dose of American exceptionalism by planting a U.S. flag on Planet Zero and Instagramming it.None of it would've happened if they hadn't been drunk. So raise a glass and get drunk, because you never know where you might end up the next day, or who you might become.It's funny that VON DOOM gets jealous over the face time Reed gets with Sue, but Reed only seems to have man-bro love for his buddy, Thing. It is a bit reminiscent of Captain America's love for Bucky.The final battle includes some pretty laughable special effects, especially when Reed does a double-punch across about 50 yards, à la Dhalsim. But even though they have some differences, the Fantastic Four are able to set those differences aside to save Earth and become a family.It would be touching, but who wants to touch the Thing?",Fantastic Four
177,FilmMuscle,Careers Are At Stake Here!,4,8 August 2015,"Fantastic Four has had one of the most controversial, fascinating behind-the-scenes stories in recent years, and it seems like nothing but negativity has followed the production to its end. Critics and audiences alike are now completely ripping the film apart, but–in my opinion–for some of the wrong reasons. Many apparently just expected another fun, endlessly humorous superhero movie (with boring non-stop action) as if there aren't enough of those. Director Josh Trank had the right idea to implement some more refreshingly unique elements into the superhero genre though. Fantastic Four starts out its first five minutes introducing us to Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) in their childhood where their friendship truly sprouted. Seven years later, and these kids are now teenagers working on a fairly interesting science fair project that apparently irritates the school's administration more than impresses them with its ability to teleport small objects. I mean, who wouldn't scoff at those ""pure magic tricks,"" right?From there, Richards and Grimm's lives take a wild turn when they're recruited by a professor named Franklin Storm who runs a government- funded research institute. His daughter, Sue Storm (Kate Mara), and he run into this school demonstration and invite them to participate in a scientific experiment that could fully envision interdimensional travel. That's when every major character, at some point or another, runs into each other and the real journey begins. The movie very concisely takes us through all of their introductions and the fateful meeting. In fact, this first third of the film is grounded in science and is utterly focused on exploring the sci-fi origins of the property. Geniuses are conversing about compelling scientific theories and concepts, and several montages detailing the experiment's progress ensue.However, after their expedition into another dimension goes terribly awry, the four friends wake up to sheer horror (their bodies have been horrifically mutated and their physical abilities frighteningly enhanced). At that point, Fantastic Four immediately turns into a cool body-horror movie where the superheroes painfully struggle with what their newfound powers have transformed them into: total monstrosities. Richards' limbs are stretching six feet forward, and an ominous score hits. (That's surely a new take on a genre that's been growing increasingly stale–the wait for Batman v. Superman is frankly unbearable). We even witness an eerie introduction to Dr. Doom in his full villainous form as he walks down a facility hallway—dim lights flashing—and blood thereafter lines the walls. The demon's pressurizing force and telekinesis faculty ruptures the soldiers' heads into gory stains. Honestly, the entire sequence made for a boldly gritty scene in a big-budget PG-13 film. So, when moviegoers criticize it for lacking fun and humor, I frustratingly think to myself, ""is humor now part of this firmly defined criteria for a superhero movie?"" It doesn't need to be ""fun"" if the tone is going for something far more intriguing and inspired.Now, how could a film with such a promising start turn into such a comical, cheesy mess by its climax? When you take yourself so seriously as a movie and set yourself in a creepy, haunting atmosphere where you're battling with the unpredictability of science and then, all of a sudden, turn into a generic CGI-infested superhero movie by the last twenty minutes–that's when you really deserve to be called a disaster. That, in essence, is the problem: there are so many tonal shifts that you have no idea what the overall vision of the film even entails. At first, it's a Sci-fi feature about youthful inventions and imagination. Then, it turns into an incredibly dark and bloody horror film, and then, once everyone realizes they only have 25 minutes to conclude the story, there comes the pressure to finally end on the typical superhero note.Continue the review at: http://moviemuscle.net/fantastic-four-2015-review/",Fantastic Four

Ant-Man was at least a little entertainment, but Fantastic Four is pure sh...t. What is wrong with the Fantastic Four then?

There is no chemistry between characters or team. And when they finally got they super powers is conclusion total mess. Four lackluster teenagers hopping around in the front of the green screen which is after wards filled with nonsense digital effects. Nothing gets out of the characters and when digital effects looks like mediocre television series digital effect is catastrophe unavoidable. Is this what you have to pay a price of a movie ticket? Unfortunately. Usually I don't let critics to make commonplace for my movie experience, but this time I've should listen the warnings. Let just hope that Marvel takes seriously this catastrophe and leaves Fantastic Four to comic book pages. I just wonder where they spent all that 200 million budget if final result looks like this piece of crap? Maybe at Hollywood these digital effect makers capitalize stupid Hollywood studios with greedy. Tenth of these Hollywood budgets European studios make far more better efforts than this is. As a movie experience Fantastic Four is like a root canal therapy, long and painful and cost you a lot of money. If you like it, be my guest, other avoid this crap and don't buy a movie ticket.

I heard that when this movie was announced they told that this will be a more sci-fi than a superhero.....It's not concentrate on action which is the fault for it and also it concentrate more on story.... but it's not that bad that i read in critics and early reviews!!! The story was simple and there is a one good thing in it if they didn't inserted the action they doesn't increased the film's length...The film was just 90 minutes and I am OK with that as they didn't inserted the action this duration is good if they had made a 2 hour or a 2 hour+ movie it would have been a mediocre.So overall the film was OK not that great it was looking initially from the first trailer and all.

181,cnycitylady,Fantastic Failure,2,7 May 2016,"Wow. Josh Trank outdid himself this time. Absolutely nothing fits together or makes sense in this half baked, poorly stitched together flop of a film.First things first: stop rushing things. The screenwriters seemed to be so eager to get their hands on a supposedly lucrative film franchise that they didn't think through what the plot would be or how the story should stand alone or fit into anything else. The scenes kind of haphazardly jumped from one thing to another without a viable segue. And unknown to me how they did it, they managed to have the entire film moving at a glacial pace story wise and still felt like it was speeding towards the climactic ending that was, in actuality, rather anticlimactic. Also the actors had NO CHEMISTRY which is rather ironic as they were playing scientist and a few of them had acted together before. Their scenes were devoid of any real passion for the subjects they were discussing or each other. You would cringe as they tried to laugh at a joke they made or at the awkwardness they brought out in each other. It was just overall hard to watch.But the real demon in this drudgery was the fact that the film didn't explain anything. Absolutely nothing gets spelled out for you in any way, shape or form and you are expected to just accept the blatant pseudo science that they peddle out to you as if we don't know better. Well newsflash Trank, we do know better. We do. And we don't like your treating us as if we were stupid.

When the trailer got released, it actually looked really good. The first reviews came and I thought it couldn't be THAT bad. Unfortunately, I was proved wrong. The 2005 version was a freaking masterpiece compared to this. First let's talk about few good things in this movie considering there is no much of that. The acting wasn't anything special but it was okay. CGI was cool (except that monkey) but when all that big action finally started (in last 20 minutes) I already lost my interest. Dr. Doom doesn't look the way he's supposed to but is still pretty intimidating. That scene when he starts a chaos in the end was really good. The first half was okay but slow. And now the bad things: The plot is a mess. Victor is a whiny nerd. It tries so hard to be realistic and ends up just being dark and depressing mess. The Thing's naked butt. There are, like, 3 action scenes. Takes itself waaaaay to seriously. On the half of the movie they get their powers but they only get to use them in battle in last 20 minutes. Even Batman & Robin was better because you could at least laugh at it. You can't even laugh at this. This is just sad. If they make a sequel, make it right, please.

183,tkarlmann,Better than these reviews and those of Critics!,9,24 May 2018,"I think this film is a lot better than "" War for the Planet of the Apes"", the latter movie got good reviews, but bored me to death -- what am I supposed to do, learn sign language to appreciate that Apes crap?. I'm tracking all these Marvel Movies to what I remember from reading the comics in the 1970's. This movie is good with reservations.1) Too much time spent with young Reeves's as a child and his ""Science Project"".2) Not nearly enough ""romance"" between Reeves and Sue.3) No time spent on Ben's adjustment to his new self.4) No time spent on any of the Four in developing their powers and teamwork.5) The BEST scenes in the older FF film were those adjusting to Earth Society; those were absent in this film.UPDATE: Just watched the film again -- and this time I gave it a ""9"" (up from a ""7"") All of my reservations above are true; but I think this second viewing has allowed my to view the film more on its own. (And, Sue Storm seemed to be cuter this viewing) Very, very good film; give it a watch!UPDATE: Just watched for a 3rd time 11 June 2021; found the film to be very good. I cannot tell what studio execs did to the film, but my guess is they mucked it up. It's really hilarious that a comic that (apparently has stood the test of time at least since the 1970's when I read them for a few years,) can have such apparently universal disdain from the film industry. I disliked the continuing ""origin stories"" of Superman -- as they seemed to go on forever, over several films; but this origin story of the FF was quite good. However the film ended where most FF comic-stories begin -- with the incredible teamwork of the FF working together. I'm sticking with my ""9"" rating.P. S.

187,rjsf96,The Fant4stic Flop,3,3 January 2016,"NB: This is less a review and more of an amalgamation of the thought processes I had during my viewing of Fant4stic. It's a departure from my usual style of writing. I hope you enjoy it all the same.Will 20th Century Fox ever learn? So this is the third or fourth attempt depending on how you count at a fantastic four film. It remains hilarious that Roger Corman's poorly filmed nineties entry is the best of the series and now Josh Trank's 2015 reboot is the worst. Before we get started I want to make it clear that this was my most anticipated superhero film of the year. The very first trailer had me hooked. It felt fresh, new, and inventive. The tone felt right. I started comparing it to The Dark Knight Rises. I told anyone who would listen that the franchise was in good hands. Josh Trank would not let us down. How wrong I was.Although this film is a travesty, it does have one thing going for it; the story is different than the other Fantastic Four films; which is either a blessing or a curse depending on how devoted you are to the original Marvel comics series. Five teenagers create their own teleportation device, don't worry I will skim over this part, like the movie does. Just don't ask how they ever created it in the first place. The writers have no idea, that and they are desperately trying to erase this film from their portfolios. Who can blame them?Four of the teenagers; Reed, Johnny, Ben and Victor use the teleportation devices to transport themselves to a different world which they can discover. The last teenager Sue stays behind, the men do all the dirty work and Sue is presumably making them cups of tea. But things go awry. The planet collapses and Victor is lost in the ensuing chaos. The four remaining teenagers gain powers, some good, some bad and ugly. You may be wondering why I haven't summed up the characters traits. That's because they don't exhibit any. They are merely character a, b, c, d and e. At this point I'm wondering whether I should even care, when a film is made this haphazardly and well, terribly for that matter. There's no one to latch onto. No emotion. No heart. No soul. Even films that dealt with darkness and the loss of a person's soul had something to cling to. Fant4stic doesn't care that you don't know who's who and you can't tell them apart. Want to know why? Because it's a money making scheme. Attract big stars, an up and coming director, the marvel brand and it's a sure fire winner right? Wrong. Fant4stic was a flop critically and financially, receiving worse reviews than the previous films and less hard earned cash. Fox might want to rethink their technique; they don't have a clue what they are doing.After they receive their powers, the teenagers then spend a year brooding. Then some guy in a comic con mask shows up and does a bad impression of Bane. Queue atrocious dialogue, naff special effects and battles so short you'll swear you played the film in fast forward mode. They groan, moan and sulk a little more. Then Reed says he's thought up a name for them ""We'll call ourselves The Fantastic."" Cut to black. You are left with a feeling of emptiness and pure hatred. You scream and cry. How can a film that's directed by Josh Trank be this dire and mind numbingly clichéd? Well he only directed half of it. The producers finished the film and the re-shoots are blatantly obvious – look at Kate Mara's blonde wig for further proof. Still not convinced? Well as soon as a queue card comes on the screen that reads ""one year later"" it marks the departure of Josh Trank; the only person in the film, well alongside Kate Mara, Michael B Jordan and Miles Teller who actually cared. But it doesn't matter. They're signed on for bigger and better things. I applaud them for moving on. But what about Josh Trank? Star Wars rejected him on the grounds that he would not be a suitable director for their project and now he's nothing. That's show biz. I can imagine him crying in a corner, alone and confused. Someone needs to give him a hug. I want to be the person that does.D+",Fantastic Four
188,thegreenarrow-28184,4 For not so Fantast 4,4,30 September 2019,"Blah, just a blah movie, this feels more like an early 2000's movie, its just so bad, im not sure what they were going with when they made this movie, The acting is OK the plot is not very strong, The actors portraying the characters are terrible, they are way too young, this movie really is as bad as people say it is.",Fantastic Four
189,vistheindian,Doomed,3,24 August 2015,"Quickie Review:Genius young scientist Reed Richards (Miles Teller) builds a teleportation device to another dimension. After visiting the other dimension a tragic accident leaves the four young outsiders with shocking new abilities. As an old threat comes back, the four must team up to face Doom (Toby Kebbell) together. Fantastic Four is a failure on multiple levels. The characters are underdeveloped, the pacing is completely off, the villain is generic and bland, the story is lacking, and most importantly it is not fun. Fantastic Four is so dull, with little redeeming qualities that it may cause you to think that the previous attempts at this franchise were actually decent in comparison.Full Review:What happened!? I was among the few in my group of friends who was genuinely excited and was rooting for this new incarnation of the Fantastic Four. It has a great cast, writer, and director, all the essentials to make a good movie but somehow, almost nothing clicked.It is a pity that the movie didn't work considering the cast. They were the one decent aspect of the entire movie. Despite the occasional awkward dialogue, at least they gave it their all to their respective roles. In fact they may be the reason why in the first 30mins I thought ""this isn't so bad, what was all the fuss about?"" Of course, I spoke too soon because the movie randomly starts to lose track of its own plot.Where do I even begin with the negatives? I am not an avid Fantastic Four comic reader but even I know that they are supposed to be a family. At no point did I feel them sincerely bonding with each other. Near the end they throw a couple of punches together for about a minute, and that apparently constitutes as teamwork. It all felt contrived, only Reed and Ben's relationship was believable and that's because we see them together as kids in the beginning of the movie. Other than that it makes no sense why these four would be working together. And that's not something I should be questioning!!!Then the pacing, or lack there off. The problem is that the purpose of the whole movie is to setup the characters of the Fantastic Four for the next movie. So there is no coherent storyline. It is just stuffed with filler scenes of people sitting in front of computers, people deeply brooding, or lame practice montage to fill the run- time till the villain shows up.As for the villain, first of all, the character design for Doom is horrendous. He looks like a crash test dummy with a burnt curtain on his head. He has one of the shallowest motivations for being villain. Then, in a typical dumb villain style, is almighty powerful that he can literally blow people's heads with his mind but will refuse to use this power against the heroes. Because you know, you don't want to make things too easy for yourself right?The biggest sin of this movie is that it feels like the film studio and creator are ashamed at even the idea of Fantastic Four. These characters in comics are colourful and have funny banter with each other. But the filmmakers were so concerned about coming off campy that they went unnecessarily dark to the point that even the characters don't embrace their hero names. We live in a day and age where audiences are embracing a talking tree, gun-toting raccoon, and a guy who controls ants. So show some pride in the fact that you are the Fantastic Four! Or at least fake it so we feel less ashamed of watching this fantastic disaster.Everything that could go wrong with this film, went wrong. There was so much potential, and you see glimpses of that in the first 30- 45mins of the movies. But then the movie quickly divulges into a meandering plot that concludes with one of the most abrupt endings in recent times. You better off watching the 2005 or 2007 Fantastic Four movies and I can't believe I am saying that.",Fantastic Four
190,WasiReviews,I LITERALLY WATCHED THIS ON A PLANE THEN WALKED OUT,1,7 September 2020,"It was December and I didn't go to the theaters to see Fant4tic in the summer and I'm glad I didn't waste eleven bucks on it but I wasted 90 minutes of my life. The acting was awful the characterization was like Suicide Squad but way less entertaining (I'm not saying Suicide Squad was good movie but its Oscar grade in comparison to this film). It had some really awful CGI and visuals made it feel like 120,000,000 wasted on college project level movie work. The cinematography was non existent I've seen films from the 70s shot better than this. This film failed in every regard and when I watched it it was and still is one of the twenty worst films ever. This film makes the early 2000's Fantastic Four movies look like The Godfather and it's sequel.",Fantastic Four
191,kupcr,The Second Time Is Worse Than The First,5,30 December 2020,"I decided to watch this 2015 remake of the first bad 2005 Jessica Alba Marvel film 'Fantastic Four' and although it was interesting at the beginning, whoever scripted this really didn't get it right either. I liked Kate Mara as Susan Storm as she is a much stronger character actress than Jessica Alba who's a really awful actress. I prefer Mara. Also, actor Reg Cathey and Tim Blake Nelson, who plays Mole Man, are great! Overall, the adventure and the plot were ok, but many of the scenes didn't make sense and their friend Victor who fell into a lava type substance on the planet in the beginning of the movie, survived to become Dr. Doom, as it wasn't really explained. The 'Dr. Strange' type thing that he did to planet earth was pretty cool, but there was no rhyme or reason why he became evil and why he wanted to destroy earth wasn't known. The ending regarding the new research laboratory is where they came up with their name and apparently the new facility the F4 will be working from is not on any 'government books'. To tell you the truth, it was an enjoyable film, but Rotten Tomatoes gave this a 37%, but I think a 5/10 is a good rating. Some Marvel films are terrible, but why remake the Alba Fantastic 4, only to make it worse than the first?",Fantastic Four
192,drawlife,Joyless and bland.,4,10 August 2015,"Ugh. Just bad. Really really bad. You can tell that Fox totally tinkered with Josh Trank's take on the Fantastic 4. I just don't understand why a Fantastic 4 film is so difficult to make. Obviously a movie is a different medium from a comic, but the comics are right there as a template, and Fox Studios just keeps disregarding it. It's a shame cause despite all the negative reaction and the dumb look of Doctor Doom, the trailers had me sold into the film. You hardly care about any of the characters in this movie. It's exposition layered upon exposition. Sure there are some moments where they do have moments but ultimately choppy editing and storytelling dismisses everything that is remotely positive about this film. There are moments when the story is just starting to kick in, but it keeps cutting away and away. The narrative does not flow eloquently at all. It's very scrambled, especially after they receive their powers. Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, and Jamie Bell are solid actors, but they are barely developed and their talents can't even disguise the stink that is this movie. I did however sort of liked Reg E. Cathy as Franklin Storm, there was some down to Earth-ness about him that sort of put the movie together in a way. Now lets talk about Doctor Doom. They failed him so bad. He is arguably one of Marvel's greatest villain, at least in the top five and they just cannot get him right. It's insulting. Tim Story director of the first two Fantastic 4 films did a better job representing Victor von Doom than Trank and Fox. Wrap your head around that. He just appears out of nowhere and is suddenly evil and also gains powers that are far more powerful than of the core four without any explanation, did I also mention he looks flat out dumb. Toby Kebbell is a fine actor, but just like the others he's wasted and dull. Keep in mind this is a short movie. Surprised that it was, and it was missing key sequences that we saw in the trailers. This movie definitely needed more time to pave things in gently so that there is a natural feel to the story. If you thought that the first two acts were bad, the third act is just unbearable. You see the world sort of in peril, but you don't care cause you're not invested in anything. The visuals aren't terrible, in fact I really liked the display of superpowers, and how the Human Torch and the Thing looked, although the Thing could have used some pants. That's one thing I can say positively about. As of now it has an outstanding 9% on rottentomatoes. Somewhere Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios are smiling. That doesn't mean they'll get the rights back obviously, cause it's all on Fox's hand and it's their property, but I do think it makes the chances higher. Potentially. Having said that I think this proves that the behind the scenes drama was fact not a rumor, director Josh Trank also deleted his tweet about how Fox messed with his version, but think about this, I don't believe for one second that the studio messed with his version of the film for the sake of messing with it. I think it ultimately comes down to two reasons. Firstly, Fox probably wanted it to be more marketable and more comic-book oriented, or they just weren't that impressed. Secondly the test audience, if there was a screening prior to the reshoots, then people probably did not like it anyway which prompted Fox to make all those changes. So perhaps even if they didn't touch Trank's version, it may have been still bad, meaning this project was doomed from the start. Save your money, there are better films out there. A good Fantastic 4 film can be made, it's been done before, and it's called The Incredibles. At this point, Fox have three strikes on their Fantastic 4 property, let them go home, they deserve and belong to be in the MCU they'd fit and gel so perfectly. When the MCU reaches it's end with Thanos in Phase 3, who's better to top Thanos or match him in Phase 4 than the Skrulls, Annihilus, Doctor Doom, Silver Surfer, or Galactus himself. Fittingly it deserves a 4/10",Fantastic Four
193,jonnithomas,Fantastic Flop,2,12 August 2015,This film has such possibilities and ends up simply being a waste of time.The characterisation is minimal and the storyline non existent.it plods along without actually saying anything or doing anything worth watching and certainly isn't enjoyable.I watched it as I really liked the FF of comic days.This is a 2d copy without anything of value. It ends with a computer generated 'battle' which is simply boring and limp.It's really really not worth paying to see and I would only watch it free if it was raining badly and I didn't have a coat.,Fantastic Four
194,coljam21,It was pretty cool to me,7,2 September 2015,So I know this got low ratings on IMDb but the previews looked good. Also I've realized that sometimes movies get a rating of 9 on IMDb and I rush to go watch it and I am greatly disappointed. Also In reading the reviews pretty much all the people that gave a low rating are fans of the comic and familiar with the whole story and history of the Fantastic 4. I have never read the comic book and the first time I heard about them was with the firs movie with Jessica Alba.I enjoyed the movie. It was youthful and fun. The graphics were cool albeit a little cheap looking. The thing looked pretty impressive. Much better than the one in the first movie.I really can't complain about the movie. It was entertaining and fun. I guess watching it with unbiased eyes is best.,Fantastic Four
195,clarkmick33,WhOa - Calm down Critics,6,22 December 2015,Critics seem to be really taking out their daggers and knifes for this movie and in some cases I can understand where they are coming from. I know comic book fans would be disappointing. But I always acknowledge the directors more liberal approaches to story telling.The movie was overall entertaining enough to watch through and I was actually amazed at the CGI that was utilized to show the powers of the four team members. However some of the back story seemed a little ridiculous such as young child discovering telleportation and making a device out of scrap. I found the cast to be a little young to be believable. The whole backstory around about how they gained the powers was a little bit silly - green goo - creativity seemed to be lacking. I feel Dr Doom was portrayed quite well and was very threatening however his on screen presence was too short and he was defeated too quickly to build up any real threat. I felt they rushed the ending and I am not sure why. Overall I did not mind the darker tone - however the story telling could have been better and the characters could have been provided with a little more depth. Watch it for what it is another run of the mill Marvel superhero movie.,Fantastic Four

There.We discover their origins. We see them try to cope with their new identities and powers. Then of course, there's the big battle royale with Doctor Doom.

198,tjgoalie13,An Unfortunate Mess,4,7 August 2015,"The Fantastic Four wastes a talented cast on a humorless, sporadic, generic movie that unfortunately is a steaming hot mess. Going in I was excited, coming out I was saddened. The unfortunate thing is the film's not so bad it's unwatchable, it's just a flat third act drags the entire film down. The origin story usually encompasses some build up, that is a given but the entire film contains 2 action sequences, and 1 of them is about 3 minutes, while the other is anti-climactic. The pacing is thrown off because instead of progressing the pacing the film stops and slows down, while the special effects crew does as well. The film may have gotten away with this a little more but the last 45 minutes are dull, because the actors are suffering from Star Wars syndrome (a lack of direction), and there's no humor to help move things along. Then after a boring 30 minutes one of the best comic book villains of all time is shoehorned into a climax, just for the sake of having one. The climax is so generic it comes across as anti-climactic as it never really surprises. All in all this film was a mess that ended poorly due to sporadic pacing, a lack of action and humor, and a generic plot and villain.",Fantastic Four
199,kdavies-69347,Avoid this movie. It's terrible.,2,18 November 2015,"There are few redeeming qualities in a film like this. Everything from the altered plot line, the characterization, and the lack of any emotional quality, make this possibly the worst Marvel (and cinematic) entry of 2015.I for one, am really tired of writers trying to modernize or change classic comic stories, to better suit the audience. They assume that we want something updated, with lots of CGI, and twists and turns along the way. Simpler is always better. The original stories are classic, and beautiful to begin with. The genius struggle of Richard trying to prevent humanity from destroying itself, and from outside threats. The depth of love Susan has for him and the family they build together. Ben's emotional state when he knows there is no going back to his original body, and of course the positivity that the Human Torch carries for the team even in the heat of battle. They were full of struggle and strife, sacrifice and obsession, and a willingness to do good. This movie brings none of those feelings to the screen. The plot is so terribly altered from the original that it makes no effort to connect to it's origin. Everything falls flat.The actors are so young by comparison to the characters in the comic, that I felt no real empathy towards them. Reed was a genius at birth, but no scene in this film brings about any depth of his intelligence. He's foolish, undramatic, and has very little ability to emote (considering Miles Teller's fantastic performance in Whiplash, I was shocked to say the least). The other characters (2 of which are just CGI) are fairly one dimensional versions of the comic book characters, and lack any real feeling of unity or family, between them as a team.The truth is, this is what happens when you have poor writing, poor direction, poor editing, poor acting, and a large budget. Fox ruined this one from the get go.If you're a fan of the comics (or of superhero movies in general), then avoid this movie like the plague.2/10",Fantastic Four
200,theemuhammede,Not quite there yet,6,12 May 2016,"This new installment for the Fantastic Four did not live p to expectations. It was highly anticipated, and it let down many viewers.The main problem with this movie is the character development. The majority of the movie was spent on the back story of the transition into the Fantastic Four. It really was too much, and there is only one reason for this to happen. It only makes sense if the series is continued. That way there is less of it in future movies and there is more of a story to it instead.Dr. Doom was pretty intense, but there was barely any of him in it. Both before and after he had his powers, there was not much of him at all. But when he finally made an appearance with his powers, he was powerful in his ability. He was much stronger than what Dr. Doom has ever been. His suit was magnificent. His evil was pure. Even with all of his power, he did not last that long at all.This movie has its disappointments; however, if the series is continued it should make for a better foundation if the continuation is played out properly.",Fantastic Four
201,georgecoffeynewyorker,Very disappointed with lack of ACTION,5,12 August 2015,"Well what can I say about this film. It was a good film. That's all I can say. It is unfortunate that it has been getting bad reviews etc., Well unfortunately I can agree. Another friend of mine was saying that their's action for about 5mins, how true is that. Great action between Victor/Doom() and the Four, namely: Reed(); Johnny Storm/BABE(Michael Jordan); Ben(Jamie....);Sue(); Great action, that only lasted for about 5 or 10mins if even that. The rest was all about the science aspect and the lead up to the aftermath. Like the original actually dealt with plenny of Action, no doubt, it also dealt with when the Four get infected, how they deal with it, and not only that how the PUBLIC deal with that. This film, ie the Reboot, did not deal with any of that. Its like the Four were in seclusion. One thing that really lacked was COMEDY. Every form of Marvel I have ever known, has always had some form of Comedy. However this one NOT ONE. I was surprised. The film starts off with Young Reed and Young Ben trying to build a Teleporter for a Science Fair. Franklin Storm sees this and he and Sue, daughter of Franklin actually want the idea. So they go ahead. I was a bit lost with the government aspect. So then Reed is introduced to Victor/Doom who is said to have started the whole thing. My precious bundle of joy Johnny Storm(son of Franklin) is out car racing and gets into a car accident. So his father collects him and recruits him into helping the rest of the crew, to build this Teleporter. During a one night drunken encounter, Johnny, Reed and Victor. Ben(whom Reed rings him) go through the teleporter with a view of Going through and back within the night. However things go drastically wrong because Reed sticks his hand in some gueye stuff and it explodes. Everyone gets infected. Johnny has become the Human Fireball, Ben the Rock, Reed the Extender and Sue who discovers their ploy, also gets infected when they arrive back on Earth and it explodes. Sue has Invisibility capability. Reed then disappears claiming he is trying to get back to the way he was and the rest of them for that matter. Sue and Ben are tasked by the government to get Reed back. So afterwards when everyone is together, they now have to face their NOW rival former friend Victor or now known as Doom. Then the Four now need a new place and face the Government. Cleverly done I must say when the Government say ""What happens if we say no"", Ben/The Thing seen as saying I think its best you say Yes and My precious Johnny says""Just say Yes"".",Fantastic Four

203,Oberrated,Can we pretend this doesn't exist?,2,21 April 2016,"*sigh* Oh Fantastic Four I was pulling so hard for this movie guys, I really was and remember, this is my opinion. You guys can form your own but I say this in all honesty, this movie was not good and that is putting it kindly for the sake of being a respectable review blog. This movie had a whole lot of build up for a whole lot of nothing by the end of it. You rarely see the Fantastic Four's powers in full combat besides maybe the last ten minutes and even in the last ten minutes that was the final fight, this fight was garbage. The end fight was brief and was ultimately a giant let down. The whole movie was mostly back story and the construction of the research project. It has zero to some similarity to the comics we all know and love, and the writing, oh my, like a friend of mine said was ""something you would've heard out of Captain Planet"". I give respect to the idea that it was a younger and ""modern"" cast and Michael B. Jordan, Miles Teller, and Kate Mara are respectable individuals in their own right but not even their acting ability could save this film. Miles needs to call up Scorsese and have their movie pushed up a little bit to give Miles his respect back that many may lose in him after his hit Whiplash. So in conclusion, this was a sad adaptation, ladies and gentleman. You wait and wait for the action and the kick-ass moments we all know and love in comic book movies just to see practically nothing memorable.",Fantastic Four
204,Sjhm,"Dreadful, what were they thinking?",2,13 August 2015,"I went into this film with the decision that I was going to give it a chance. Unfortunately my resolve faded fairly quickly. How can something so short seem so interminably long? The story, yet another origin story (why do we need to keep rebooting with the origin, we all know how the four were made) was fairly original, I grant you that, but the execution? Terrible. Much has been made of how good Chronicle (director Josh Trank's previous feature) was. I saw Chronicle, and stylistically speaking, this is almost a retread. As though Trank has one original idea and he was going to mix up the elements a little and apply the result to the Fantastic Four. The problem is that this is Marvel, this is a long-established story with much loved characters that were almost unrecognizable. The tone was quite dark, however it was also dull and lifeless. The four leading actors were bland and unremarkable, it was hard to care about their fate. Only Victor Von Doom offers us anything like the twisted personality that Von Doom is supposed to be. Unfortunately his screen time is limited, and making him a borderline creepy stalker, to counteract the maybe romance between Reed Richards and Sue Storm (that goes absolutely nowhere) was just pointless. Miles Teller never comes out of sulky teenager mode, there's no fire or passion, he's just one note, as Reed Richards, that's almost an unforgivable sin. Jamie Bell looks really uncomfortable as Ben Grimm, he is a fine actor, but the script gives him nothing to get his teeth into. The Storm siblings have been re-written as an unnecessary socially modern family, with Sue being adopted (has nothing to do with the plot, and really only serves to flag up the complete lack of chemistry between Kate Mara and Michael B Jordan. As siblings they seemed to barely know each other. So disappointed in the film, that's £13 and one hundred minutes of my life wasted.",Fantastic Four
205,pcrprimer,What happened - disjointed venture that started well,5,27 December 2015,"Based off of reviews and box office numbers I knew that this wouldn't be a great movie but worth a shot nonetheless to see how bad it is. It starts off very strongly with the child actors and showing the bond between Reed and Ben. However it didn't really develop it past the surface. Also it was comical to pass these characters as 18 with the actors that portrayed them as they clearly looked in their mid twenties. Regardless, the first half of the movie was focusing on developing the sense of comraderie between the team and them after the accident it almost becomes horror like briefly with their powers and pain in isolation. Them it shifts again to become a cheap action movie. It has a very short run time so it's clear that they cut up a lot of the movie.",Fantastic Four
206,kevinmorice,Not Fantastic! Not four of them!,4,7 August 2015,"Fantastic?! Four?!What an utter mess of a film. I knew before going to see it that there were a lot of production problems as the movie was rushed out to fulfil some contractual clauses regarding who owns the rights to the characters. That is no excuse for this turgid mess. Miles Teller and Kate Mara need to go back to their respective agents and fire them. At least Jamie Bell has the decency to hide behind CGI for the small sections of the movie where he bothers to show up.The title is a mess. There are 5 of them, that much is obvious from the trailer. Also the Fantastic part just never happens. The clues were obvious in the trailers though. Some of the quotes change between trailers, so it is clear something funny was going on. In the end result most of the quotes in the three trailers are not even in the film. The few that survive in their trailed versions are used completely out of context in the trailer. I can completely understand why Stan Lee doesn't appear in the movie. He must be so utterly disgusted at what was done to his work that he wanted to distance himself from it. That they need to squeeze in an adoption to justify their black character, and completely miss that ""the Thing"" is actually a metaphor for racial discrimination must be like a punch in the face to his original creative talent.",Fantastic Four

208,Theraxorterminate,"Not only one of the worst movies of 2015, it's also one of the most boring and disappointing superhero movies ever made.",1,29 September 2015,"Let me preface this to everyone first, I don't consider myself a big superhero-fanatic but I still enjoy many superhero movies we've had for the past years. Most of them are worth- watching but I strictly avoid those that are considered awful and I could agree with most of them who didn't like the bad ones. I have deliberately tried to avoid this movie after hearing so many bad things about it, but I decided to give it a shot anyway and find out if it truly was a bad movie or not.And after being able to see it, I can honestly tell everyone that this is truly a bad movie and my biggest question is what on Earth happened? The first minutes really got me interested and after 10-15 minutes it rapidly went downhill. It's very hard for me to tell what were the things that made this movie so bad in the first place. But I think I'm going to start by saying that this movie felt like it had absolutely no idea what everything in this movie were going through. The story is uninteresting, the whole teleportation thing became uninterested as well too. The acting was stiff and dull, none of the characters were remotely interesting either without any chemistry at all and had very little development to deliver.The custom designs were horrible too, they looked pretty simplistic to me and why on earth didn't they even give the Thing any pants? I've seen him wear pants countless times and even a clothe that covered his torso before, but this movie is a slap in the face for presenting him as a nudist and I don't like the idea at all.But one of the biggest disappointments of the movie would be the main antagonist Dr. Doom. His villainous appearance was way too rushed, it felt like the writers of the movie thought that everyone knows who he is and let's not waste more time explaining what he does. Come on, not everyone in the world knows who he is, if a certain character becomes evil you gotta at least find a new and interesting way presenting him instead of ignoring his appearance. I honestly think that even the Dr. Doom from those two previous Fantastic Four had a much more interesting appearance even though I loathe those movies.The final battle was incredibly ridiculous and if not laughable. It reminded me of a certain flaw from Man of Steel were one of our heroes seemed to get destroyed once and for all but managed for almost no reason to get out so darn easily and kick the villains butt quickly. It's rather something I would expect from a comical cartoon and not a live-action superhero movie.I'm very sorry I didn't like it at all, it's no wonder that almost everyone disliked it. Not even Matthew Vaughn who gave us Kick-Ass and X-Men First Class could save this drivel. And if that's not enough to tell how bad it is then I would say this is as bad and on par with Iron Man 3, the two The Amazing Spider-Man movies for some of the most boring and disappointed superhero movies ever made. It literally left me with a bad taste and I'm still dissatisfied with it. If you love superhero movies you won't like this one or if you love action movies then don't waste your time it will only bore you. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie and watch a good X-Men film or MCU movie instead, even the animated movie Big Hero 6 (which is also a Marvel movie) was a hundred million times better than this.Well at least it won't exist in the X-Men universe, although I was pretty eager to see an extended universe with both these superheroes meeting each other but after seeing this movie and reading its trivia then I changed my mind and can at least be calm. But hopefully we won't get a sequel, I can already imagine the sequel being bad too.1/10",Fantastic Four
209,nmholland,Worst Yet,2,27 January 2016,"I hated this movie a lot, so I'm gonna make this short. Fantastic Four is the story of four friends that create a portal to another dimension and go there and get superpowers and fight bad guys and do other stuff. Or at least that's what I thought. Now I think it's about getting money. It really makes me mad how many movies Hollywood releases for money and money only. Normally, I would start would start with positives, but there literally are none. And, since there's so many bad things, I'll just say the worst things.The first horrible thing is the script. This movie has some of the most lazy, gross writing ever. No exaggeration. Anyways, moving on.The second horrible thing is Doctor Doom. For anyone who knows what Doctor Doom looks like, (from the comics) that's not what Doom looks like. This Doom looks like a bunch of recycled tin cans wearing a green scarf. If you're a fan of the comics, don't watch this movie.The last horrible thing I'll talk about is the third act. This film's third act is the most boring thing I'd ever seen in a superhero movie. It felt like a bunch of lazy, rich people with no writing abilities decided to write a movie.Overall, Fantastic Four gets an F for freaking horrible.",Fantastic Four

Blatant continuity issues, on the nose dialogue and you can practically feel the moment that Miles Teller gave up on his performance.",Fantastic Four
211,Exiled_Universe,BEST FANTASTIC FOUR MOVIE OF ALL!,9,16 July 2019,"I dont know why people hate this movie, i just loved it and i thought it was easily the best Fantastic Four movie of all time. Now first off im gonna state the bad things where there was only 1 thing, ALL THE GOOD PARTS WERE CUT OUT! The part when Ben drops out of the plane in the trailer was so cool and i was waiting the whole time for that part, i heard that there were many scenes that were cut out but not the best part, so for that im very sad. Now the good stuff which is all the movie. Doctor Doom looked so good and did a great job at being a perfect villain. Its makes a lot of sense and shows how the kids get their powers. The thing looked cool and the cinematics was god amazing, especially the shoulder shot when doctor doom was walking down the hall killing everyone with the light flickering oh god that was cool. It all fit together well but the ending felt short even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes and i actually thought the ending was OK and wasn't that bad. My dad and mom liked and i loved it and like i said i love the movies that everyone hates.",Fantastic Four
212,feakes,The Fantastic Four a movie without a heart or soul.,9,14 February 2016,In 1961 when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby envisioned a new type of superhero team. They wanted it to be a family. As Lee once said most teams were just that Teams. but we wanted ours to be a Family with the dynamic of a family that acted like real families do.That was the heart and soul of the Fantastic four. a superhero team that was emotional and dysfunctional as a real family. Reed Richards the stern father type wanted to build a rocket to take us to the moon first. To beat the Commies. Sue Storm the rich socialite who funded the Richards Rocket and who was in love with Reed. Her Younger brother Johnny a 16 year old car jockey. Johnny could fix or build anything. And Finally Ben Grimm Reed's best friend. Ben is the greatest pilot alive he can fly anything. When the Rocket takes off the four are subjected to the cosmic rays which transforms them. Reed becomes Mr. Fantastic Sue the Invisible Girl Johnny the Human torch and Ben becomes The Thing . together they face menaces that want to destroy or rule the Earth.The Comics were exciting They had heart and soul and a lot of humor. As well as tragic stories . The Comics made you feel for the heroes and made you feel sorry for the Thing. Now Flash forward. to 2015. Josh Trank is given the job to reboot the Fantastic Four. He pays attention to the Ultimate Fantastic Four series from Marvel. A drastic mistake as the ultimate Fantastic Four was no where as good as the original and made a mess out of their origins and Doctor Doom's . Not to mention the film is all over the place. IT doesn't feel like they're trying to tell a story but are undecided as to what comes next. The heroes act out of established character. And things just don't ring true. It seems forced. Almost like Trank didn't know anything about the Fantastic four to begin with. Michael B. Jordan was cast as the Human Torch early on and the fans revolted. And Jordan didn't disappoint. His Johnny is so smug arrogant and childish that I wanted to slap him. Miles Teller fared no better as Reed Richards . Kate Mera offers nothing to her role as Sue Storm. And Doctor Doom was forgettable. The only dim light here was Jamie Bell's performance as Ben Grimm The Thing. He made Grimm's agony shine thru. And you felt the pathos in him. Other then that the film looks good but has nothing to offer. Its like a beautiful 67 Chevy Impala with no engine. you can look at it all you want. but you are not going anywhere.,Fantastic Four
213,voicemaster71,Fresh From the Cardboard Cut Out of Suck: The Craptastic Quartet,1,12 August 2015,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!! As a lifelong fan of Super Heroes and comic books, I have always loved movie adaptations. I love the good ones, and even with the bad to mediocre at best ones, I have always found something in each of those movies that I liked, that made it worth watching. NOT THIS TIME: I admit, I am more of a DC fan and I follow characters like Batman, Superman, Aquaman, Justice League, etc, over Marvel, but what limited things I do like in the Marvel universe, I have always loved the Fantastic Four. I had the Mego figures and the Power Records book and record as a kid, I enjoyed reading some of the comics back then and I loved the animated series from 1968 by Hanna Barbera and even the 1978 series with HERBIE the Robot. And I personally loved the Fantastic Four movies with Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans. I love both the 2005 and 2007 movies. They may not be the greatest, but at least they stayed close to the source material. When I went and saw the new reboot last weekend, my reaction was the same as Cameron's loud scream in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It was a complete abomination!! If you're going to make a movie based off a popular iconic franchise, do it right!! Stay close to the source material and don't get too far away from it. I believe in the old country saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" And that's exactly what 21st Century Fox did in their unsuccessful attempt to keep the franchise. The best thing they could have done was turn it back over to Marvel. They would have done it right. While I understand that some of these changes have taken place in the Marvel Ultimates Universe, I bet they haven't been around for too long. I say stick with what most people know. Here are what I hated the most:1: A Naked Thing: Really?! Come on!!! There are kids watching! Would it have hurt to give the Thing pants?! Even if it wasn't the shorts from the comics, at least Michael Chiklis's Ben Grimm had nice pants and he was the same tough Ben as opposed to this little guy. They really Joel Schumachered this movie really badly!! 2: Reed Richards age and characterization: Too young to be believable. Plus, there's no way I could have seen any relationship form between him and Sue. Plus, I did not like him being portrayed as a yellow bellied coward. He's supposed to be the leader of this team. I just can't see Reed being younger than Johnny or close to his age.3: Johnny Storm: Period! If you want to change the race of a popular established character, be careful who you select. I would have been more accepting if the Thing, Ben Grimm had been African American. But Johnny Storm? I just couldn't see it!! And Sue being adopted? This was just too much to take it. 4: The villain: We've already seen Doctor Doom. I would have preferred another villain like Prince Namor the SubMariner (and spin him off into his own movie) or the Mole Man or the Skrulls. Doom was an arrogant punk instead of royalty.5: New Story: Not Retooled Origin. I absolutely HATED this new origin. Nuff said.All in all, this new Fantastic Four reboot is something I didn't even recognize. It's like watching the Cathy Lee Crosby TV movie of Wonder Woman, which also unrecognizable. The disappointment here is that I was hoping for a reboot with new actors cast according to the traditional source material. To see the FF that we knew from the first two movies with new actors carrying on the stories with new threats and menaces. This movie was so awful, that the director, Josh Trank and the producers and studio blamed each other. Since Chris Evans (who I liked as the Human Torch) has gone on to win the hearts of many as Captain America, I was hoping for a new blonde haired blue eyed Torch. Then again, I also wanted to see the blue costumes with the 4 emblems. Not that garbage they wore in this movie.There's no cameo by Stan Lee and there are no extra scenes during or after the credits, so you're better off leaving when the credits roll. In conclusion, this is one Super Hero movie that is a complete failure and a total waste of money. If you're a traditional fan of the FF, YOU WILL NOT RECOGNIZE IT!! I dreaded this movie before I saw it and I walked away totally disgusted!! A complete two thumbs down!!!",Fantastic Four
214,iceman88869,Worse than I expected,2,15 August 2016,"I tried to keep an open mind when watching it, but...Everything seemed out of place as it came throughout the movie. The brother and sister had >zero< brother and sister chemistry. In fact, all of the characters had no chemistry or even acted like they really liked each other. I did not like ANY of the actors as any of the characters and the female was sexist. Always trying to compete with the guys like she had something to prove.I seriously thought the low ratings were just because they changed the race of Johnny Storm, but I finally pushed my self to watch this and found the current 4.3 rating is far to high for this terrible movie.",Fantastic Four
215,Tyson14,The Fantastic bore,2,31 August 2015,"With all the negativity surrounding the production from the earliest stages, I went into FANTASTIC FOUR hoping for a triumph over the odds. And in a perverse way, I guess it is, but not in the manner I'd hoped. See, with all the intense negativity surrounding this production from even the early stages, if there was one thing I didn't imagine would be possible, it was that FANTASTIC FOUR could possibly disappoint me. And yet, somehow, it did.I'll try to explain. The most disarming thing about this is that, for the first 40 minutes or so, this is a freaking GREAT movie. Like, me open- mouthed stunned, sitting in the cinema thinking, ""Oh my God, they pulled it off. This ultimate underdog has managed to silence the haters."" Yes, the characters are mostly a bit younger than they should be. But scrape past that, and in that opening sequence, this is a film that just *gets* the Fantastic Four and what makes their characters and the relationship, on a deeper level than the previous films managed. The actors are all top- notch, and inhabit their roles so well, bringing the humanity to each of the key figures and cementing who they are before the powers hit them. Miles Teller is just great in the film, and for the first time on the screen they managed to nail that Reed Richards is the most fascinating character of all the four, and that it's not his stretchy powers that make him special, it's his incredible mind. And science, and the power of intelligence and future-thinking, is presented as being right at the forefront here in a way that's kinda inspiring. It felt like superhero storytelling laced with an INTERSTELLAR-style awe with the might of human potential.Even this much-dreaded interpretation of Doom is handled so well at first. There's no computer hacker/blogger Victor Domashev: he's Victor Von Doom, from Latveria. And Toby Kebbell is leagues ahead of Julian McMahon's smarmy yuppie, and totally nails the character's motivations. He's all fragile ego and simmering jealousy towards Reed, his contempt for Richards' supposed lesser intelligence hiding an insecurity that Richards may be smarter than him. And yet still he finds himself starting to admire Reed and become friends with him in spite of himself, it's all handled so well. Sue's complicated protective relationship with Johnny, Ben feeling out of his depth amongst these intellectual heavyweights but having Reed's back no matter what, it's all touched on here. Even the origin itself is handled well, a skillful display of steadily escalating tension, with the heroes' transformations handled in a quite jarringly horrific ""body horror"" fashion that gave things a fresh new angle and totally made sense. And in terms of character focused origin-telling that makes these characters feel fleshed out and relevant, I genuinely thought Fox were on course to giving us a BATMAN BEGINS for the Fantastic Four, that's how good it was.And then it falls apart.I'll try not to get too much into spoilers, but I'll say there's a clear dividing line between what was a great film and what just turns into a mess: it's a black screen, with a caption reading, ""ONE YEAR LATER."" And everything after that, it's like a different director working from a different script. Suddenly, all that carefully built up momentum is gone. And you realise that all the stuff that was so beautifully set up in the first half of the film never gets adequately paid off. Toby Kebbell's great work is largely undone and Doom turns into a damp squib. And perhaps more unforgivably, the Fantastic Four themselves lose all their chemistry. Suddenly it's like there's no chemistry between them, to the point where they might as well have filmed their scenes separately and been green- screened together. We don't actually get to experience them becoming a team, just get told they are. The Thing in particular gets a bum deal here. Jamie Bell is actually really strong as Ben Grimm, selling his pained humanity and making his friendship with Reed the heart of the film. But he is never given a chance to really connect with anyone else in the cast or feel integral to their unit. Seriously, I think I could count the amount of dialogue exchanges between Ben/Johnny and Ben/Sue COMBINED in one hand, and have fingers left over.Really, the back half of the film just feels so rushed, and therefore inconsequential, to the point where by the end of the film I didn't even think it was the end. As the film entered its final minutes, I was thinking maybe we'd seen a lackluster mid-film set-piece, and hoping that the film would be able to claw back its momentum for the finale after a sluggish middle. Then it just ends, and I'm like, ""HUH?"" I genuinely think so many people stayed waiting for an after-credits sequence (there isn't one) because of this shared feeling of, ""That CAN'T be it."" This is a very slender hour-and-a-half filling.So, that brings us back to the beginning, and disappointment. In a way, I'd have preferred for this to just be a steaming turd of a film. Then I could have just disengaged and laughed at how awful it was. Instead, there's so much good stuff here, and they come tantalisingly close to making a quality film. And the fact that they then spectacularly fumble the ball at the goal line makes the whole viewing experience that much more infuriating. The fact they did enough right to see the great movie they set the groundwork for but ended up not making. In the end, FANTASTIC FOUR is not a turkey, and given the hate this film has endured, that in itself is a sort of triumph. But ultimately, I'd classify FANTASTIC FOUR as a frustrating near-miss.",Fantastic Four
216,OlieRendch,Oh the potential...the POTENTIAL!,5,12 August 2015,"Look, don't hate me but I enjoyed the first two, I mean sure I was 7 and 9 when they came out but I laughed and was amazed at the superheorics at the that time, they remain fond memories. So when I heard this was getting a remake I was a tad disappointed, and then it starts production and we see nothing, absolutely nothing, not even a logo; months go by and we have no poster, ""first image"" and from what I remember only two secret set pics. It was strange but then I watch that first trailer and my hopes lifted tremendously, that first footage was really good and from then on I was expecting this to be a dark horse, a real good film.And you know what? It was....for the first half. I mean literally, I could pinpoint the scene where it starts going downhill rapidly. But let's focus on the good just for now, I loved the beginning. The set up was so good, we were introduced to these interesting, likable characters; the actors had good chemistry, the script was pretty solid and I was happy with where it was going. The origin was awesome to see, it was tense, horrific and I thought the special effects held up pretty well. Then there was a bit of a jump in the plot and it felt odd... just...odd. The only way I can explain it is that it was like different films, the first half being an origin story and then the latter half acting like it was deep into the franchise and this was happening after a bunch of sequels; imagine watching Iron Man and then Avengers: Age of Ultron without anything in between. Fantastic Four has so much missing in the way of development and narrative flow it just did not work. The climax felt incredibly rushed and they weren't really acting like a team and they spouted out lines as if it was from a cartoon and then you had that giant light going to the sky like every other major film seems to be doing. So plot-wise, 50% good, 50% horrible.The actors themselves did really good in their roles though, Miles Teller is a great Reed Richards and I enjoyed Toby Kebbell as Victor a lot too. That is until he turns into Dr. Doom for.....no reason what-so-ever, with a really bad costume and very undefined powers.In the end, I don't know the specifics of what director Josh Trank was up to on set or what the studio was wanting it to be like, but like it's production, Fantastic Four unfortunately was just weird and disappointing. If you do watch it, stop after the first half.",Fantastic Four
217,keithlovesmovies,Fantastic Four Review,4,23 September 2015,"After having traveled to an alternate universe, four outsiders gain superhuman powers that have altered their physical form in amazing ways. Reed Richards (Miles Teller) can now stretch and twist his body at will. His best friend Ben Grimm (Jaime Bell) has gained immense strength. Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) can control and project fire. His sister, Sue Storm (Kate Mara) can manipulate light to become invisible and has telekinetic abilities. Together, they must come together to battle a former friend Doctor Victor Van Doom (Toby Kebbell) who now poses a threat to Earth.I have never seen any of the previous Fantastic Four films beforehand but I was aware of how they were received. I will just come out right now and say it, this film is not very good. I was surprised by how boring it was. Nothing really happens until near the end which is too late because you'll probably just not care by then. I understand that this film is a reboot but you shouldn't spend most of the time doing the rebooting. Most of the time was spent setting up things for the end. Unfortunately the setup here is all bad as the four main actors have no chemistry whatsoever. They never quite spend anytime with one another or even really interact with one another at all as most of this is done off-screen. You're never able to get emotionally invested in any of them. Kate and Johnny have few scenes together and when they do, their interactions imply nothing more than a friendly relationship. I did not buy Reed and Ben being friends either. Ben only comes on late so he does not have too much interaction with the rest of the team and he never really spoke with anyone other than Reed. Because of this lack of bond or chemistry between the actors/characters, the final act becomes void of any emotional depth and you don't get much of a sense of accomplishment. The special effects don't represent a film in 2015 either but I'll let you see those for yourselves. The main villain of the film Van Doom is silly looking with powers that defy all realms of sense because he could simply do anything. His plan just came off as random because we did not get to know to learn too much about him since he is absent for the majority of the movie. This was a shame because I actually liked him and I wish I could have seen him a little more. Perceptive viewers will notice subtle differences during the film's final act as it was reshot so little continuity errors will be evident and what also made it obvious that it was reshot was how it did not fit with the rest of the movie tone-wise. What disappointed me was that I felt the actors just didn't try and that came across while watching it. I heard that the only reason this film was made was so Fox could retain their film rights to the Fantastic Four before they returned to Marvel in 2016. I have three words for them, Let them go.Score: 4/10 keithlovesmovies.com",Fantastic Four
218,charliep14,In all honestly it's not very good....,3,10 August 2015,"I went in with very low expectations. I didn't find it to be a total trainwreck, worth 9/100 on review sites etc. while watching it. But, a few hours later, when I think about it; I have to be honest : it's not very good. Basic stuff to poke - although it's almost too easy : the characters never look like teenagers. Hard to identify / find them credible when they look like 30 really. And some actors (the big evil corporation guy especially) were just not good. Special effects were also of another era. My partner described them as 1990s' level, I found them to be direct to video level. And this is supposed to be a summer tentpole, so that's not acceptable. And finally: the story lacks a point. Half the movie setting an origin, another half not going anywhere... Pretty poor in retrospect. As a fan of the source material since my earliest years, the sanction has to be severe - it's simply not good.",Fantastic Four
219,kieranbattams,Is it honestly THIS hard to make a good Fantastic 4 Movie? Really?!,4,6 August 2015,"I get that it is hard to make a film, i really do. I have made 5 minute long student films that were even hard work so yes i appreciate it isn't easy. What i mean by the title is that is it so hard to read the source material and make a Fantastic Four film? This may sound harsh, but really.. this does not feel like a Fantastic Four at all!First off, if you have seen the trailer you know the plot, and i mean all of the plot. There are no surprises here that we weren't expecting. Miles Teller, bless his soul, clearly tries his best here. He is a brilliant actor as proved by Whiplash. A lot of the time he plays the awkward geeky guy which he does here. What he isn't playing is Reed Richards. Anyway, Reed and his friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell, who also just feels out of place) create an inter dimensional teleporter. Dr. Franklin Storm recruits him to work for the Baxter institution. Along with Johnny Storm and Susan Storm as well as Viktor Von Doom they.. travel to another dimension.. and get powers. Doom becomes evil and tries to destroy the world, they stop him. Seriously, i feel like i was telling you spoilers as that is all the film has going for it literally. From the casting day i wasn't on board, where most people were outraged at a 'black' actor playing Johnny Storm/Human Torch, i wasn't, i was glad Michael B Jordan was taking on the role as i like him as an actor. Out of the whole cast i feel he was still most suited to his role because none of them have chemistry. Are we supposed to believe this Reed Richards and Susan Storm will fall in love. We really don't, probably because Kate Mara was so wooden and dull in her role that we never even connect with her.I like the government element of it all, where these people get powers so are used for publicity. Problem is that this was thrown in our faces within seconds of them getting their powers. I like the look of the Thing, but Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm doesn't feel right. I still don't believe he goes from that to a big rock monster but in terms of design and powers the Thing was the best designed. I loved the idea of the Fantastic 4 feeling these powers are more disabilities than superpowers. It hasn't been seen in the movies before. But it was never actually shown to us. They get these powers, mope about them a little bit, and then are just like 'oh, maybe they're actually good because the script says so'.. So no, this film doesn't even work as a body horror which would have been awesome.The thing that made this movie the disappointment it is though. The whole third act. It starts off sloppy enough but has good moments. The last act was just shocking. First off, Dr. Doom. Viktor felt off to begin with, he is then reborn as Doom out of absolutely nowhere. He appears and all of a sudden just hates everyone and everything and decides that the earth sucks and should be destroyed? What was this performance Toby Kebbel? His design was AWFUL. Metal mask? Nope. THAT IS HIS FACE! Then within 10 minutes of introduction, he is gone again. Talk about wasted villains. I am not joking, the Rhino in the Amazing Spiderman 2 was more faithful to the source material and may as well have had the same amount of screen time. When I start to think of something i like about this film, something negative comes and takes that away from me. The visuals did not look good (with the exception of the Thing as i mentioned). There is no chemistry between the cast, it was dull, the action scenes even felt boring. The powers of the 4 didn't even feel like they were really used. Kate Mara was playing the Invisible Woman. Yeah she has other powers which we saw, was she invisible? Nope. Believe it or not i wanted to like this, but well done Josh Trank you managed to screw these characters up even more than they were before. If set rumours are true then it shows. The film felt rushed and nothing was believable. Ant Man and Guardians of the Galaxy are almost unknown comic book characters. Their films were miles better than this. I can't recommend this to anyone. See Ant Man again.. or Inside Out.. or even the original Fantastic Four. Don't waste time on this film because i don't think even it knows what it is trying to be.",Fantastic Four
220,zadeereviews,Wow. These reviews are bogus. Don't listen watch for yourself,7,28 June 2020,"First I want to say I read reviews and I skipped watching this movie while ago. But recently I watched it thinking let me see how bad it is like how these people saying it is. I must say it's no where near as bad as these 1 star people making out it to be. It's good origin story. Definitely a new take on the comic characters and their background. It's thoroughly enjoyable from the beginning to the end. My guess is all these bad reviews must have been paid Disney since they wanted to buy the rights of fantastic 4.

221,russellingreviews,What is coming? Doom for this franchise,4,5 August 2015,"With every new discovery, there is risk. But we are stronger together than we are apart. - Dr. Franklin StormWalking into the cinema... Does this franchise need another re-boot? Overall Rating: 2 stars Cinematic value: 2 stars Big questions value: 3 starsIt is hard to believe that it has been 10 years since the original Fantastic Four film, but in 2015 we are introduced to a new and younger foursome. Director Josh Trank (Chronicle) takes on the retelling of this familiar graphic novel tale, but takes it all the way back to a youthful time in the lives of the team. The central focus is Reed Richards (Miles Teller), from his misunderstood child genius stage to his recruitment into the Baxter Corporation. He is sought after by the group for his technological abilities and his affinity for quantum transport. As he is introduced to the fateful pack of geniuses, a journey begins of building their friendships and the technology that would provide their eventual powers, the quantum transporter. At the conclusion of the project, Richards and the crew take a harrowing journey in their transporting creation. In the process, they find themselves on the new planet, Zero, and come in contact with its mysterious transformative properties. They experience a series of events that lead to the loss of a counterpart and find themselves with unexplained physical abilities. The four contemporaries have to learn how to manage their new skills while the government attempts to find a way to get back to this new planet of possibilities. Over time the youthful bunch learn to use their new found skill sets and develop a partnership to defeat a new enemy, Dr. Doom (Toby Kebbell), that comes from similar origins as the powerful foursome. If Josh Trank has proved anything throughout his short directorial career is his ability to recruit some of the best young talent in Hollywood. In Fantastic Four he assembles a wonderful central cast for this origin story. At first glance this re-boot seems to offer a trailblazing experience on a well-worn trail of super-hero legend. Miles Teller (Whiplash), Kate Mara (House of Cards) & Michael B. Jordan (Fruitvale Station) provide the new legs that a proper re-franchising needs. The story has promise through the first half of the origins journey until the initial transport journey and then something goes horribly wrong with the script and direction. Primarily that they lose the central character, Reed Richards, for the whole second act. Without their leader at the helm, the story becomes rudderless and loses its heart, even with the potential development of their transformative abilities. In the third act, the writing becomes merely elemental and clichéd. What should be a tension- filled climax to the inevitable battle between the four friends and their enemy, Dr. Doom, proves to have little more than a forgettable conclusion to a misguided narrative. The Fantastic Four is disappointing in that with the potential strength of the first half of this film could not translate into a better second half.Trank may have a knack for young talent, but fails to provide the right players to perform the menacing government officials and that of the villain. He is the primary disappointment of this cinematic adventure. In the beginning, Toby Kebbell plays the brooding loner well, but cannot act his way out from behind the bad make up and effects. This is not a reflection on his acting abilities as much as a poorly crafted script that fails to provide a formidable foe for the four young heroes. This comes down to being a lesson for a young director of super-hero film: the heroes are only as interesting as the villain they must battle. The expectation for Fantastic Four would be to provide fresh chemistry in this overworked genre, but the results never seem to make their way out of the laboratory. Even in a less than satisfactory package, there are a multitude of different ideas to ponder. This team focused story bodes well to the discussion of unity and the value of each part of any community, but the heart of the story is a discussion of belief. The father-like force of Dr. Franklin Storm talks about his belief in the young Fantastic Four. As would be expected, this belief is misplaced, because this small band of young scientists do eventually fail him. Which consistently proves to be the case when you put all of faith into humanity, mankind will let you down. Yet, the discussion of belief does not have to be hopeless, there is more to consider on the topic of belief or faith. Is it in humanity or is it in something outside of ourselves that faith should be placed? Should belief be in another super-hero franchise or should it be in God? Something fantastic that is worth considering. Leaving the cinema... Originally, I wanted to become a believer in this new Fantastic Four, but ultimately this belief was misplaced. If you want to see a better super-hero choice this year, go see Ant- man. Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1.

222,Wirxaw,Doesn't return from the other place.,4,2 November 2015,"Can't believe something can be worse than ""Unamazing"" Spider-clone or Transformers: Age of Rebooting. There has to be solid effort, I mean, really, indie movies can be more entertaining.I can't say better than how the top reviewers here have said, they got it right:The movie had it, HAD it... right until the big launch. After that it sort of narrowed down to chasing Waldo and then saving the world faster than Superman. But as much as they had it, a lot of stuff was really over-clichéd. In the long run, it could be forgiven, it's a superhero movie, after all, but with the predictable start and the obvious finale, only one question remains - what the **** have they done to Doom? I thought Malekith was the worst character design, but Doom is one of the most iconic villains in comic history. He has to be something more than... C-3PO. Seriously, 40 years they've done it better.Besides that, Reed was quite likable. Can't say that I like the actor, but he pulled it off. Susan's actress I can't stand after Transcendence. That horse-face just begs to be punched, it feels wrong to see it have emotions... Personal feelings aside, all she did in this movie was being the object of desire. Nothing special in her character was ever discovered, except for maybe her passion for music and patterns.Human Torch... well, that's just wrong. Why not make Ben black? Would suit him perfectly. Or Reed? That would be a laughing stock - intelligent *censored*. But no... you have to torch the black man! Torch the black man! Black people do well with comedy, but... I ain't a comic fan, but Torch is a crazy white trash. White. There's a huge gap in personality, a huge level of crazy and obnoxious that only whites can be... This actor... felt terribly out of place. Let him drive, by all means, gangsta stuff, but believing he is a narcissistic flaming guy? No way...Ben Grimm had spot-on kid actor. And an absolutely unfitting grown-up. Not only unfitting to the growth pattern, but also unfitting to the idea of the character. First we see a tall, chubby narrow-eyed bugger. He grows up to be short, slim, absolutely different-eyed guy? Besides, friendship doesn't work like that. If he and Reed were so close, no friend would just go nuts and say ""I ain't your friend"".Doom was as token as they come. Instead of some believable smart guy who really, really gets screwed big time and now holds endless grudge against all the good - he is a douche who acts like a douche, sorta gets left behind, and... voila, I'm Ultron, I'm building a new world.And how they got their powers... There was ""three"" of them, Susan wasn't really even affected, much less explained, why does she turn invisible. Okay, Ben was crushed by rocks, radiation absorbed them to keep him alive, Reed was probably malformed and that as the only solution the radiation found to keep him up, and the black man was set on fire... *snort* Susan was just knocked unconscious on the site. What, the radiation felt that Susan would be embarrassed? Or she was supposed to hide in fear and save herself from this emerging threat? Anyway, their power attainment was extremely straightforward.After that... they just fast-forwarded through the plot we don't really give two damns about, before pushing that Prometheus-style finale.In conclusion, this is the movie you sort of start to enjoy, giggle, eat some popcorn, relax... then you start to think: ""the ****?"" And before your thought is complete, you see the happy end, wondering... was that some TV series pilot?",Fantastic Four
223,chickenjackson,adjust expections from action-film to exploration and you'll be fine.,6,30 May 2021,"I definitely don't think this film, although it has its gaps, is worse than the original film series. True, if you want non-stop action and everything spelled out for you this is not the movie to watch. However, if you want a story that explores what it might actually be like to find yourself with powers you didn't ask for, true to trask form, this film goes there.",Fantastic Four
224,Small-Screen-Superman,"Full of interesting ideas, but in the end was remarkably empty and unsatisfying",3,16 March 2016,"Miraculously, despite this movie's unutterably poor reception, it still managed to...well, disappoint me. How did it pull off such a seemingly impossible feat? Simply put, this film had many, MANY glimpses of potential throughout its run time. There are so many partially-realized ideas in this film that could actually be really amazing if they were really fleshed out. But that's the problem: nothing is fleshed out.For example, there are so many hints of characterization and character relationships here that make me genuinely interested in the characters, but at the end of the day, they aren't really developed into something that feels in the slightest bit ""full"" and realized. There's so much that not only could have been done, but NEEDED to be done, that just simply wasn't. It's not enough to touch on a few basic aspects of a personality, or establish that a certain relationship between two characters exists. I want to know more about who Reed is apart from knowing he's just a typical nerdy child genius, and I want to see more in-depth Ben and Reed's friendship and how it developed, I want to know and ""feel"" more about all the characters and their relationships. This movie gave me enough hints to make me thirsty to know these characters better, but it simply didn't deliver the goods, leaving me feeling very dissatisfied.I could say the same thing about the powers, too. I think they actually had a pretty interesting angle on superheroes. It's more inherently cynical, I suppose, and I can certainly see why some wouldn't like that, but personally I thought it was a pretty worthy concept to explore. But in the end, the fact that the movie did a poor job of truly fleshing out the characters and connecting you to them really lessened the psychological impact I should've been feeling at the ""body horror"" superpowers, or the fact that they were being weaponized. Plus, the powers themselves were literally just not shown enough, much less used in enough cool and visually engaging ways. Seriously, Invisible Girl barely even turns invisible! As many others have mentioned, the bizarre pacing in this movie, combined with its short run time, is a huge problem. It's hard to describe just how rushed and unfulfilling the final conflict is, and even though the rest of the movie before that was basically dedicated to setting everything up, somehow it still feels so underdeveloped.Overall, there's really only one word I can use to describe this movie - empty. I won't say it was devoid of entertainment value or interesting concepts, or that I think watching it was a waste of time. But it wasn't a good movie, either, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're just plain curious. Not only is it not very good, it's not even bad in a good way. It just feels like the lifeless corpse of what could've been a good movie but wasn't. It's not a movie that contains a lot of bad stuff so much as a movie that's severely lacking in ""good stuff"", and in many ways that's worse.",Fantastic Four
225,~AleXa~,Fantastic Failure,1,5 September 2015,"Reviewed August 8th, 2015 - 1st viewing (Theatrical 2D) Fantastic Failure From the moment I saw the age bracket of the actors cast in the lead roles, I was skeptical at best. Then when I read how they'd butchered the origin story/plot to accommodate, I was even less enthused, and with an announced 1 hr 40 minute run time and no iconic actor playing even a minor role, which in point-of-fact is a first in the history of Marvel films, I had little hope. However, I tried to remain positive, much to my chagrin.Arguably the worst part of this movie is their audacity to lull you into thinking it's going to be decent with the opening sequence with Reed and Ben as kids. It served to show us the characters in a light we'd never seen and made it a bit more intriguing—who doesn't like a good origin story? That being said, I have no clue if any of that is referenced in the comics, so I digress.From there, it all goes south. The characters were neither dynamic nor well-fleshed out, serving to act as stand-in cardboard cutouts. Clichés abound Reed Richards as a child-prodigy inventor whose parents don't understand him, Ben Grimm as the son of junkyard owner (because otherwise you'd never know who was to be the muscle), Johnny Storm as the 'bad egg' whose walking the wrong path (by racing his Toyota AE86 and sliding into a pole? Really?), Sue who just fades into the background as the adopted daughter of the great Dr. Storm, and Viktor von Doom, a wayward student who thinks he's too good for his britches And of course Johnny is angry with his father for caring about him, which serves to set up the inevitable father-son moment after he is mortally wounded... Didn't see THAT one coming. Then they attempt to explain that Sue's brother and father are black because she was adopted from Kosovo, which only serves to leave you rolling your eyes instead of feeling informed.As usual, the main characters are treated as idiotic teens with hormones where their brains should be, choosing to use the machine after hours to cross to another dimension, mind you with absolutely no one at the helm to call them back, but eh—minor details, right? The not-so-fantastic three plus Doom wind up in another dimension and decide that with their vast scientific training at the ripe age of 18 that they're going to explore said planet with NO equipment to extrapolate any data or collect any samples, and then anger the planet by poking it until it consumes one of them, and yet the rest make it back by osmosis. They further insult us by sending the four without Sue, who just so happens to get blasted on the return journey.We find the 'three' now confined in individual rooms and being tested on. Then, when Reed hears Ben calling, he goes from barely being able to move his hand to completely unstretching and escaping, crawling naked no less through an air vent to promise his best friend he will save him and then disappear for an entire year?! It's as if the writer's had no idea how to create the necessary angst and that was the best they could come up with. They have The Thing running around in nothing but rocks, which just seems wrong, doing the government's dirty work as if he never had a brain to begin with.The pace of the film is inconsistent, varying from slow to fast forwarding, leaving the audience feeling as if they've experienced whiplash by the end. The score is mediocre at best, neither serving to drive the plot nor enhance your emotional experience. The computer graphics were laughable, looking like something out of a late 1990s video game. Everything comes off feeling unnatural and forced like you're watching a bad comedy play out that thinks it's a drama.The climax (if you can call it that) left something to be desired, providing no explanation whatsoever for how the life force of the planet now suddenly only existed within Doom, or how he magically manifested a black hood on the barren planet—I guess that's one of his powers? The writers spend twenty minutes trying to establish how impossible it is to kill him because of his strength, and then they just magically do it and come home in a force field bubble? Somebody help me out here There is nothing left to do but hand the reigns over to Marvel—this train has been off the tracks since it was conceived. Much like the epic failure of the Not-So-Amazing Spider-man, a third reboot will now be required to undo the catastrophic damage done here. In all seriousness, it would have been better if they'd kept the original cast and had Chris Evans as Cap by day and the Human Torch by night—THAT would have been more believable I wish I could get the hour and forty minutes of my life back There is nothing left to say except THIS FILM IS NOT WORTHY!FINAL VERDICT: Not even worth your time. Go see Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation a second time so that you can spend your hard-earned money on something worthwhile.1.0 of 10.0 NOTE: The first films weren't that bad—you have to keep in mind they were out when only X-Men and Spider-man led them, and they were designed to be more comedic. I laughed out loud, cried, and rooted for them, so they are a success in my opinion. Go back and watch them with an open mind—they are better than you think, and I don't only mean if you compare them to this atrocity.",Fantastic Four
226,jcallows,gritty realistic action-- it's fan-tastic!,8,20 December 2015,"Like many others, I avoided this film because of the poor reviews and bad press. But I eventually got around to watching it when I got the hankering for a sci-fi film. I had the mindset to find flaws in this film and criticize them but, you know what? I ended up liking it! I liked the gritty, grounded feel of this film. The powers seemed more real because they are presented in a realistic world. I liked the initial reactions to getting the superpowers which was mostly of fear and concern. This felt real. Interestingly, while the casting of a black person broke the stereotype of a white superhero, it also reinforced another: the stereotype of an angry, rebellious black punk. But this was a minor distraction as the cast on the whole was fine. The Thing was well done as he was portrayed more as a person with a rock-like exterior, rather than some rock monster.Though there wasn't much action, I found myself still engaged. The build-up to getting the superpowers was suspenseful and what little action happened after was interesting. I did enjoy watching Dr. Doom do his damage during the little time he spent on earth. That was pretty cool.Special effects were great. With a backdrop of a realistic world, they looked real, instead of like a cartoon. As far as the film's adherence to the source material, I can't comment on that because I don't read comics. Perhaps this is where the bulk of the negative reviews come from. But as a stand alone film it was entertaining.It's true this film's final act seemed short and rushed. But on the whole, this film was still good. It's better than the cartoony Fantastic Four films of the early 2000s. And it's better than some of the recent comic book films like Iron Man 3 (flying robot parts, wtf?), Thor 2 (another cube/sphere/gas to destroy?), Captain America 2 (no winter soldier and faked death, really?), etc. Perhaps if you keep in mind this film is more a science fiction film than a superhero film, you'd enjoy it more. I did.",Fantastic Four
227,prospectus_capricornium,"Has Some Great Moments, But Takes Too Much Time to Become Interesting, Long Enough to Make Us Not Care",5,5 August 2015,"There's probably some salvageable remnants left in Fox's previous attempts to bring one of Marvel's most popular superhero team, FANTASTIC FOUR, to the big screen. That's maybe what Fox thinks in pushing this new adaptation, given how franchises keep being rebooted and resurrected these days, assuming either lighter or darker takes, to pull away themselves from the shadows of their previous (most often, forgettable) forms. The latter is more evident with this film, as Director Josh Trank, puts a darker spin to it, employing a grittier feel to its plot. While that is true and recognizable, there's no denying of its desperate efforts to emulate its Marvel predecessors. Unfortunately, though, neither, succeeds. If it's any a consolation, Trank has assembled a group of actors that are all naturally charming, you would find anything messed-up they're in, tolerable.The spotlight is cast upon young genius, Reed Richards, at the beginning of the film, working on an experiment that attempts to construct a teleportation device. It was hardly a success as the object they've sent to who-knows-where, never returned. Seven years later, now teenage Reed (Miles Teller) is again trying his luck on the same experiment. The attempt yields a better result but is still dismissed as a magic trick by his high school teacher, but not by Dr. Franklin Storm, who at that moment, is drawn with utter interest to Richard's experiments. The meeting brings Richard's feet to Baxter Institute where he is joined by Storm's daughter, Sue (Kate Mara), his son, Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), and Viktor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell), to work in completing a larger and more advanced version of Richard's device. The success of their effort prompts their team to send all of them four to their target alternate universe, but the consequence is far worse than they could imagine.It's easy to dismiss Trank's Fantastic Four as an unfortunate victim of superhero fatigue that emerges in the wake of the continuous influx of superhero movies inundating the big screen, but you can't shrug off its fatal narrative flaws that include unfocused pace and bland character developments. The latter may have been completely covered by the actors playing the two-dimensional characters, but expositional defects keep sending them to becoming something the audience might find hard to care about. Perhaps its the ill-contrived rationales behind how all the often-sense-deprived proceedings work, that keeps the film constructing a form, worth-of- attention, or the forced CGI-gimmicks that strip the sense off the moment's supposedly strong sentiments, that hampers its spectators' ability to absorb its message, and thus, feel that the dangers these characters are about to face, is real. Either way, it's difficult to care, much less find reasons why we still should.If it's any consolation, the final battle of this film,sparks hope. But who knows who else is up with eagerness to see it when the rest of the film strikes more than enough to make the audience not wait for any longer. 5/10",Fantastic Four

Yeah it may not be the best movie in the world but its a great action movie and certainly a good Sunday afternoon's entertainment.I found the special effects excellent and the characters very good and really enjoyed the fact that the story began when they were kids which was a great angle for the fantastic four and one I had not seen before.So don't always take reviews at face value.

233,Ingrouille181,Give it back to Marvel; we don't need a fifth attempt,4,7 November 2017,"The fantastic four are, an interesting group of superheroes, and it's just a shame that they could never get the Guardians of the Galaxy treatment like they should have; the 2005 film being the closest thing we'll ever get. I know that Fox has to adapt a film from the fantastic four (like the X- Men) ever 10 years or so to keep the rights to the characters, and the end result we have for this movie just proves the desperation. I've also heard a lot of controversy and problems that director Josh Trank had with the studio and vice versa.So anyway, the story. As a kid, Reed Richards discovers a way to create interdimensional travel, and after many years, succeeds. Discovering his potential, Dr. Franklin Storm offers him a scholarship, putting him together with his daughter Susan Storm and fellow young scientist Victor von Doom, to harness this new discovery. We meet Dr. Storm's son Johnny Storm, as well as Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm. One night, these young scientists embark on a mission of their own. But after something goes horribly wrong, they discover they have been given superhuman abilities. It's up to them to master their new abilities, and defeat a final threat that's a blast from the past.That's about it; the story is clunky as all hell. Dialogue is fine, actings OK, definitely not their A game. I do like Miles Teller as Reed Richards, but honestly I thought Ioan Gruffudd in the 2005 film fit the character perfectly. Kate Mara is fine as Sue Storm, and I liked Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, but even then I don't think any of the FF movies had the definitive portrayal. I actually liked Michael B. Jordan. As the portrayals go he does showcase the kinda immature, bratty, hot headed personality Johnny is meant to have, and can have his more serious moments. The CGI is fine and I liked that we had an actual CGI Thing this time around. Looks great. The visuals are interesting to look at and the music wasn't distracting or painful to listen to.That being said this movie was just a mess. The story dragged on and by this point. Treat it how you'd treat a future Batman movie, or a Spider-Man movies; ditch the origin story, we know how they become the Fantastic Four. And if you do have to put one in, don't put us through it over half way through the film. The villain is bye the numbers, spewing the same worthless garbage we were given Batman v Superman from Lex, and he's a throwaway villain; the worst part being he's meant to be DR. DOOM! Four times, they've used him in these adaptations and they've failed. Everything about the look of the film is just bland. I guess Trank was going for the Christopher Nolan ""dark and edgy"" tone but does he have to make it look depressing too?As for Josh Trank and the studio, I'll address the studio first. I don't know what was going through their heads, cause it just feels like they made this to either just keep the rights, or make a quick buck, or both. And if that was the case, why not just hire some low key director instead of Trank? Last time I checked, Chronicle wasn't successful because he was getting beaten to a pulp with mandates and studio interference; it was successful because he was able to have creative control. No one thought the first Iron Man would be a success, but because they gave Favreau creative control, it turned into one. I could tell almost near the end this was crapped out into theaters simply to keep the rights; they knew they messed up. If Fox can't just trust creative directors with their properties, then don't hire them in the first place; just get Brett Ratner instead.I don't know exactly what Fox is even doing with the Fantastic Four rights these days. If they're keeping them simply to make a quick buck every ten years then whatever, I'd expect nothing less. But if they have the intention on making an interesting film, with ""heart, and passion, and breathtaking"" moments, they've screwed the pooch far to many times now.I'm giving Fant4Stic a 4 out of 10. I just hope the next Fantastic Four movie has the words MCU plastered on top. And yes, I've heard about the new idea for the FF, about them as kids or something. Not a fan and it comes off as desperate to me.",Fantastic Four
234,YRLY59E,Startlingly bad,2,14 August 2015,"There may be spoilers in this review as I'm not even sure where to begin but here goes nothing...This is a bad film. Very bad. It isn't just that it cost a boatload to make and doesn't live up to its expectations, it's just bad. Acting is terrible, pacing is terrible, I can't stress enough that it's bad, and you've been warned. If you're looking for accuracy to the original story, you're not going to get a lot of that either. Pacing is terrible it's another thing I can't stress enough there is about 45 minutes of it that just drag on and on it seems, though I think the bad writing exacerbates it.The first 15-20 minutes I actually laughed several times when the film wasn't supposed to be funny. The dialog was cheesy. Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm has a street racing sequence where it looks like they're trying to copy Fast and the Furious more than anything (I guess originality isn't a strong suit here), not to mention Johnny Storm wasn't African American in the comics, but whatever, they don't even have the ages correct so it doesn't really matter. By this point you already realize things are pretty much out the window so you go along for the ride.After you get past the first 20 minutes prepare yourself for about 45 minutes of inane dialog and Miles Teller as Reed Richards staring at a computer monitor (yes, this happens several times and he has this blank gaze on his face), lots of people sitting at boardroom tables and so on. Some of the sequences were so boring I was researching the film during them (don't worry, I didn't disturb any moviegoers because there was hardly anyone there).Things start to pick up in the last half an hour in lead up to the final battle. Our heroes get to battle Victor Von Doom who in this film apparently wants to simply kill everyone (he could have killed a few of the characters multiple times but apparently chose not to because he didn't). The epic battle uses cheap CGI well not exactly cheap but it looks like something that could have been done on a SyFy made for TV budget.By the end I was literally dumbfounded. Where did they burn through the money? With costumes that looked like paper mâché, guns that looked and fired unrealistically and CGI that for the most part could be done on a home computer it didn't go there. It certainly didn't go to polishing the script, it is laughably bad at points, yes you may laugh, I did several times. So much is wrong it's hard to find what's right. About the only thing I can say is I didn't walk out on it. I'm giving it 2 stars because it was OK at some points.",Fantastic Four
235,Chiller7,What's so bad about this?,10,8 October 2015,"I was prepared to hate this movie. Everything about it screamed disaster. As a Marvel fan, I was annoyed that the story sounded unfaithful to the source material. I was skeptical of the cast looking not much like the classic characters I knew. I wasn't too impressed by the trailers (which, oddly enough, use a lot of footage not seen in the movie). Critics unanimously trashed the movie, so I assumed they can't all be wrong. Most alarmingly of all, even the director, Josh Trank, publicly complained about his own movie on its own opening day, absolutely confirming that this movie must be an absolute train-wreck. Even though I already knew it had to be horrible, out of curiosity, I had to see for myself just how bad it really was.So I went to see it today. The opening sequence, when the characters were kids, wasn't so bad. So I thought maybe it probably gets worse when they grow up. As it went along, I kept expecting it to go completely downhill at some point. Maybe it goes sour when they get their powers. But it still wasn't bad. Maybe when the villain unleashes his evil powers, that's when it all falls apart. But no, Dr. Doom was actually kinda awesome. By the time of the big action scene at the end, I had to admit to myself I was really enjoying this. Dare I say it, this is actually a good movie! I have no reason to be biased about this. After all, walking into the theater, I fully expected a terrible movie.So why does everyone seem to hate it? I have a few guesses: 1) For one thing, it's not faithful to the source material. This is not the Fantastic Four we've been familiar with up until now. The characters don't look like or act like previous incarnations. They're not the fun family of superheroes we all know. But this movie doesn't try to be faithful, it does its own thing and that's not necessarily a bad thing.2) It's not as action-packed as the typical superhero movie these days. It's a fairly slow-paced movie. I guess this would disappoint you if you expected more fights and explosions throughout the whole thing. But this did not bother me, because I found the slow build-up of the story and gradually increasing intensity of the movie to be engrossing enough to keep me interested.3) Fanboys and their attitude of expressing loyalty to one thing by unleashing rage at its competitors. Currently the general consensus among fanboys seems to be that Marvel/Disney ""rulez,"" while Fox, Sony, and even DC/Warner Bros ""sux;"" so all the review scores tend to be skewed in Marvel/Disney's favor. How else can you explain the high review scores of those lame Iron Man sequels? Fantastic Four (2015), being a Fox property, unfortunately makes it an easy target for the Internet fanboy legions.4) If there's a flaw that matters to me though, it's that, admittedly, some of the character relationships could have been better. The Fantastic Four are supposed to all have interesting dynamics with each other, but some of the relationships just weren't developed. For instance, I'm not so sure if Jamie Bell and Kate Mara even interacted with each other once throughout the whole movie. Also, we all know the characters Reed & Sue are supposed to be each others' romantic interests, but this was only barely touched upon in this movie. I guess these relationships were something to be explored in a sequel, one that doesn't look like it's gonna happen, considering this one's underwhelming performance and reception unfortunately.""Easter egg"" alert: The Human Torch has a Fire Flower from the Super Mario Bros hanging from his car's rear-view mirror. That was actually a pretty clever reference to throw in there for video game fans. Good job, Trank, or whoever thought of tossing that in there.Concluding thoughts: I should know better by now than to trust the hive-mind of movie critics. Believe it or not, sometimes the hive-mind is wrong. Even if all the critics are haters, see it for yourself and make your own decision. I for one was pleasantly surprised by this movie and maybe you will be too.",Fantastic Four

238,meissotruey,Much better than i expected,5,15 November 2021,"Not bad. I mean, really not bad. Just fine for one time with popcorn. Actors doing well, design is good, partly funny movie, character driven. Can't understand all this low ratings, i mean it is better than many superhero movies with much higher ratings( and i know that this is the most unpopular opinion, but is is better than Dark Knight for example, i mean it's not as boring and empty, with better acting). What i can understand is failed expectations of audience, i mean i suppose that i kinda know what superhero movies audience wants and they just gave a shot to the other approach. I mean not the most impressive effects, poor fighting scenes, beginning takes too long, no that much of full f4 squad together, maybe not the best Doom and yeah explanation sucks. I remember how one smart man once said: "" We will never see superhero movie build on dialogues. It would be supercool, but it isn't happening and we all know why"". I'm not talking about this movie in this way, but it is about thing that usually the audience isn't ready to give a shot. I dunno, maybe bad promo happened( hasn't been following movies back there( and still not used to watch any promo or trailers)). Like, i'm so mad on good movies, i'm turned on quality, dialogues, scenario, to be honest everything. And even being this kind of annoying and complaining freak i'm willing to admit that this movie isn't bad really. If you missed it back there, like i did give it a shot now: take cola, pop corn, chill and watch.",Fantastic Four

Initially, there's this vibe that its kind of like the breakfast club. and when one of the plastic man guys invites his friend to go on a space mission leaving THE TORCH back to anchor the rope as they explore...accidents happen. the scenes where the ROCKMAN is left in a cell vs. the scene where plastic man crawls through the vents kind of reflectively brought me back to that scene where I guess the DOCTOR DOOM was in a room waiting to be invited to interact withthe scientists daughter. But all I know is that the ROCKMAN is actually that friend that came along to the mission while DOCTOR DOOM supposedly is resurrected as the guy who fell into an abyss and became as he says NURTERED by that isolated loneliness and abyss before being discovered by the military scientists looking to TURN OVER the project these YOUNG PEOPLE wanted to keep as their own and not have NASA or another GOVERNMENT TEAM of scientists to study. so, thats the first half..and it was totally entertaining but then it fell apart...and alluded to the distress and problems of having people who don't get along try and get along.",Fantastic Four

241,supatube,Fantastic Snore,5,14 September 2015,"Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is a young scientist and since a young age he has been hell bent on building a teleportation device with the help of his friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell). He meets Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) at a science exhibition. Dr Frankiln helps make his dream a reality bringing Johnny storm (Michael B. Jordan) and Victor Von Doom (Tobby Kebbell) to help build the machine. On completion the youngsters decide to test it out for themselves and find themselves in a strange world with a benevolent energy that inflicts each person with super powers.That's the just of it all. Unfortunately the beginning of the story is so well developed as it dives into alter universes and general kickass science fiction. And for a large junk of the film I forgot that it was even a Marvel comic film. Then I was sadly reminded. Saying one is not a fan of something sort of hints at being the complete antithesis of a fan but I am going to use the phrase in its most literal sense. I am not a fan of superheroes films. I don't research characters. Won't go to a convention. Never use it as wallpaper or a cover shot. Never gonna write a blog about the rich subtext of the X-Men. And that's not to say that I don't enjoy the films, I enjoy them very much but it's all for fun yeah? This film is the perfect example of why the superhero aspect is kinda silly. Everything about 'Fantastic Four' as a science fiction is mildly captivating, with a fair pace, intriguing characters and lukewarm old-fashioned entertainment - this is not surprising when the director's (Josh Trank) last film was the indie hit 'Chronicle'. Then the writers need to bring in comic book moments so that fans don't flip their lids. And what you have is cheesy dialogue to match up with the original child-inspired story. The finale is probably the most disappointing aspect about 'Fantastic Four' as they drop the ball, entirely loosing character engagement, believability and credibility. Perhaps this film is strictly for fans but if you ask me the fans are the very reason this film was unable to take creative license to a tired and dated story; reinventing the case of a group of scientific superheroes to be more than just childhood nostalgia. With a second instalment already in the works, though, it seems there was more up the production companies sleeve and this is merely something to wet the pallet. I don't care, it ends up being a Fantastic Bore.",Fantastic Four
242,SteveResin,Fantastic Chore,5,2 November 2015,"I'm not one to jump on bandwagons, and I hoped the bad reviews and bad press this movie received would prove exaggerated, so I went into it with an open mind. Unfortunately while the film isn't as terrible as I was led to believe, it's not terribly good either. It's just very average and sad to say in places laughable.Best to start with the positives. Although this film gave a slightly different spin on the FF origin story, I thought it was interesting and handled quite well, the script was OK and the cast were largely capable. Miles Teller was good as Reed Richards, and M.B. Jordan was a pretty decent Johnny Storm even though they didn't really give him much to do. Toby Kebbell was a decent Dr Doom, even though he came across like a petulant teenager at times. The end scenes where he breaks free and causes mayhem were dark and unsettling.The negatives are quite damning. The SFX were laughable in places. The Thing in particular was just dreadful. There's a few scenes towards the end where Reed Richards gets to stretch his limbs and it was so bad it made me guffaw. All I could think of was how much I miss my old Stretch Armstrong toy I had back when I was in short trousers. The planet they visit that gives them their strange powers was really bland and unimaginative. There's a huge leap forward in time which deprives us of witnessing them harnessing and learning their powers.The casting is badly flawed. Kate Mara is hopeless as Sue Storm, there's zero chemistry between her and Reed, or between her and her brother for that matter. Reg E Cathey is also miscast as Dr Franklin Storm, he's so intense in every single scene it becomes hilarious every time he appears. Tim Blake Nelson is just as bad, providing a comically bad villain who even chews gum constantly so you know, we realise he's a wrong 'un. This is FF's idea of character development. Jamie Bell is neither good nor bad as Ben Grimm, he's just kind of there, hardly speaking and looking sullen.Tim Story's decade old FF wasn't any great shakes either but it's far superior to this. At least there was a sense of fun, of wonder and of course Jessica Alba. Back to the drawing board chaps.",Fantastic Four

First off there's no other way to describe this movie, this movie is horrible. The story,the pacing, the action,the writing, just everything about this movie was bad. Even the CGI at times was very awful. Now I will say that at certain times, it was very interesting but those certain scenes only lasted a few moments. The acting also was good by everyone but you can see that they were doing the best they could do in a bad movie. It wasn't there fault. Now the action... Well there's sort of no action. The trailer shows that there will be a lot of action, but the scenes in the trailer are not even in the movie. There are maybe 1 or 2 action scene in the whole movie and they don't even last that long. The biggest problem I had with the movie was the pacing. The pacing was very odd and it jumped forward in time too many times. The final battle also didn't feel right, it felt rushed like they didn't know how to finish the movie. Overall Fantastic four was a huge disappointment. It had no fun, took its self way to serious. I Definitely don't recommend seeing it in theaters.",Fantastic Four
244,watchtiger1,Let's take 50 years of comics and re-write it,1,8 August 2015,"This is a reboot of the worst kind.I am glad I did not pay to see this movie, I saw it for free. If it were not for the snacks the movie would have even been worse.This movie was doomed long before the director got near it and no special cut could have saved his production.First of all, lets modernize it, bring characters to start with to 2007 and make everyone ""be friends"" starting with Reed Richards and an abused Benjamin Grimm who somehow become friends because Reed is a thief has to steal an item he needs for his project that in the junk yard Grimm's family runs. The stay friends threw high school. Where it just happens a black doctor and his white adopted daughter are out scouting.Now we are going to take a comic book which is over 50 years old and re-write it so everyone meets as high school age students and change the race just to get a certain race in on seeing they movie. Sony tried that with ""Annie"" didn't work there and does not work here.Add in a college aged Victor Von Doom, who couldn't solve the inter-world travel problem and must be coaxed back into the project. Because a punk kid Reed Richards had some how solved this in his garage.What is even worse that they changed the race of Johnny Storm, they then decide to present him in a stereotypical manner and show he doesn't really care about his father's work that he goes off acting like a thug race car driver.This move plods through bad script, lack luster effects, bad acting to get to the highlight of the movie ""how they become the fantastic 5"" well 4 since Doom goes crazy. This is NOT part of the original story, they just thought they needed to fit him in their bad story line.We are supposed to believe that a special school for genius kids is going to be let loose unguarded to run expensive science experiments and that no alarms were set off when this equipment is activated.This movie ends by the government giving an expensive project center to a bunch of high school student. Then Reed Richards coming up with the name which is presented in the end credits roll ""The Fantastic 4."" This should be burned and removed from existence.",Fantastic Four

247,joeravioli,What happens when you don't begin with the end in mind,4,8 May 2016,"The saddest thing about Fantastic Four is that there is nothing especially awful about it. In fact, there are some technical aspects which, while completely butchering any potential exuberance the film might have had, look quite nice. It's only when you take all the numerous parts and consider their emergent properties that you realize how much of a painful waste of time it truly was. Fantastic Four begins in a tired fashion. A boy genius befriends another not-so-genius boy who lives in a junkyard after the junkyard boy helps the genius make an interdimensional teleportation device. Yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds. But trust me, it's no more ridiculous than any of the other unbelievable stuff that Marvel asks us to blindly accept. Of course, time goes by and the genius boy is discovered at a science fair and given a ""full scholarship"" to a fancy science institute that specializes in -- what else? -- interdimensional transport.Eventually, after way too much exposition, introductions and factory-farmed dialogue, they get their superpowers in a sequence that is actually surprisingly entertaining. But as the film goes on, Trank eschews entertainment in favour of more morose dialogue. By now, we're dangerously far into the running time without any more action, humour, or even a little -- just a LITTLE -- streak of life. Anyone who's been to the movies probably knows that this isn't good. And it isn't even clever, or unique. It's just boring.Somebody at the studio must have realized this, because all of a sudden, the film's remarkably slow pacing is shattered by the most random action scene of all time. It's almost as if they threw it in there as an afterthought (""Oh wait a minute, this movie has no action! Better bring back Dr. Doom!""), and it's as ridiculous and unexpected as one could hope. Doom's malice seems to have come out of thin air, his character completely unrecognizable. The scene itself is incoherent and packed with grating CGI that together take a significant toll on the senses, and it is remarkably short for a climactic battle.Sadly, Fantastic Four is a film that has potential, but all the potential it has is crushed under a mountain of awful pacing, CGI, and unnecessary solemnity. It seems only right that this film gets a 4/10.",Fantastic Four

Given the talent and the budget involved, a much better movie should have been made. But every review I've seen has told me it's horrible, and it's really not. It isn't good; don't mistake me. It's predictable and it doesn't reward close attention. But the story line (while far-fetched) is coherent. The characters are consistent, even though they lack depth. The effects are unimpressive, but please recall that we are spoiled these days with stunning visual effects. The effects are unimpressive but not embarrassingly so.We have been spoiled by the MCU; there's a high bar for superhero movies that this doesn't clear. This movie killed an hour and forty minutes of my life, and I remember many, many movies that have been less pleasant than this one. Would I recommend it? No. But I didn't entirely hate it, either.

254,bartonj2410,Fantastic Flop,3,5 August 2015,"Over the last decade, we have seen a number of superhero movies get a much needed reboot. After the atrocious Batman & Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. Eight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.When they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.The one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.When a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.I had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.The story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.Then there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.",Fantastic Four
255,talarisw,Five people bodies are changed after a science experiment in this dark and gritty reboot of the fantastic four.,4,12 August 2015,"Let me start by saying I disagree with people a lot on movies, there's a lot of movies people criticized but I liked. Two of them are the original fantastic four movies with Jessica alba and Micheal Chiklas. So I'm going to compare those films with this one even if it might be a little unfair to compare two different takes on the four. I wanted to see the movie for myself but I was hesitant because there's so much negativity surrounding this film. But now it's time for me to give my opinion on the film. I thought on one hand the movie did work well as a sci-fi/horror film but on the other hand it never really felt like a fantastic four film. I like how the movie began showing Reed and Ben as kids meeting each other, I thought that was a good way to start the movie. If you took away the title fantastic four and just looked at this movie as a sci-fi horror movie it kind of works in that respect. I liked the special effects in the film, I thought they did a great job at bringing to life the powers of the four. The human torch looked great! He really looked like a man on fire. The effects on the invisible woman looked great I love how her force fields looked. I love when Reed was strapped to a table and his body was stretched, the effects on his body looked really good, it didn't look cgi and I liked how rock like the thing looked. The up close shots of the thing looked really good but some of the scenes where we see him walking with the team he didn't look as good. I just like the element of horror and sci-fi in this film. However the bad thing for me about this film is that it never really felt like a fantastic four film. The tone felt too dark for the four. I feel like the four should be more like the avengers in tone, very light and humorous. So in that regard I thought the two other previous FF did a really good job at capturing the right tone for the characters. I think the four should have a lot of humor like in the avengers when Iron man mocks Cap' for saying ""language"" and I think FF should have similar humor but in this movie there's no real humor to speak of and that's another thing I like about the previous FF film where there was a lot of good humor especially between the human torch and the thing. But the main problem with the movie for me is that there was just no chemistry between the five characters. The actors didn't do a bad job but the script and the director didn't develop the characters or their relationships that well. That's the most important thing about the FF. They just felt like collages, no deep relationships between them. Even after showing Ben and Grimm becoming friends from child hood I never felt any chemistry between them. Sue and Johnny are brother and sister but I never felt any real relationship between. I think the guy playing the human torch did a good job but wasn't given much. The guy playing the villain Dr. Doom before he went evil was the most interesting character but he wasn't explained very well. He's a smart guy who's good on computers, I guess? When he became the supervillian I didn't understand his transformation, I liked the Julian McMahan Dr. Doom in the two other FF films, he was a little one dimensional but he did feel like the Dr. Doom from the comics. I don't understand why every FF film seems to be afraid to have Doom as the ruler/dictator of Latvira. But there was just no meaningful relationship between the five main characters. So I like the previous two FF films because I felt they captured the spirit of the FF. So overall a good sci-fi/ horror movie but it never really captured the essence of the Fantastic four",Fantastic Four

When trailer came out, I was more hopeful, but when film came to the theaters, it's horrible and so hard to watch without laughing. Let's not just curse about it, there were some promising paths which could lead to a better reception but never happened and the first fifteen minutes were decent. The story is poorly told, like if there was some hurry to present the events. Resulting in a minor significance and concern for the public. As the super-hero and sci-fi gender didn't work that well together, some scenes were a bit off and the film didn't manage to create an identity. Some differences from the others productions of same name, which were motives for controversies and certain curiosity of how they would be explored, instead of being used with some cleverness, they were simply threw abruptly and careless. The characters are badly developed and don't gain the public's empathy.The cast, they have already showed some talent in previous works, the script and probably the fight between the director and the 20th Century Fox ruined any chance of a decent job from the acting. The CGI is awful, one of the worst in super-heroes movies. It's so bad that some older films of same gender have better visual effects. There're scenes which is even hard to believe that they were approved to be in the final product, being in such horrible and poorly finalized state which they are.",Fantastic Four
258,atlihafsteinsson,Underwhelming,4,12 August 2015,"I didn't figure it out until later, but after me and my friend went to see this movie, we didn't talk about it at all. There was just nothing to say, nothing to share. I realized later that it was because this movie gave neither of us anything to work with. It left nothing. At the time of watching it, I was enjoying myself, and I had a few laughs... but it feels like it's stuck in first gear throughout.Say what you will about the 2005 movie, but I watched that after this one, and enjoyed myself so much more. There's just way more character, humour and even action than in this reboot. I only enjoyed a few laughs during the 2015 Fantastic Four, the biggest of which was when Reed utterly failed an invitation to a fist-pump by Johnny. There's very little character development in this movie. Beyond that she was adopted from Kosovo, we know nothing about Sue, and she barely even cranks a smile. Johnny never becomes a developed character, and thus we just don't care about his angst. About the worst cinema sin happens with a single message flashing across the screen over half-way into the movie.I don't know, there's just something really missing in this movie. By comparison, the 2005 movie gave us these developed characters with complex relationships and really entertaining banter (especially by Chris Evans), whereas the 2015 reboot feels like it barely even happened. I didn't much care for the Thing being all-CG either, he just doesn't feel authentic.I guess I should've smelled doom coming when they marketed this movie as dark and serious. Marvel, that's why I prefer you to D.C., you've got a much better idea on how to make entertaining superhero movies, and you should've poured that same energy and spirit into the reported First Family of Marvel. As it is, this reboot only sheds the movies it was supposedly trying to outdo in a much better light. A big whoopsie, and it accounted for the most sombre Marvel cinema experience I've had.",Fantastic Four
259,regula1,Craptastic Bore? No. Shining Beacon of a Reboot? Also No...,6,8 August 2015,"I'll be honest with you: I REALLY wanted to love this movie going into it. I loved the first Fantastic Four film from 2005 and was disappointed at its sequel, Rise of the Silver Surfer. After seeing this new one, instead of feeling elation at a great reboot, I just feel empty. However, I don't see a reason to throw my drink against a wall and rage at a wasted cost of admission either.The four main characters have gone back to high school as compared to their more mature counterparts in the original film. Reed Richards, the super smart nerd who no one will listen to, befriends at age 7 Ben Grimm, an abused but loyal bodyguard. Together, they create a gateway to a world in an alternate dimension.This somehow loses them the high school science fair (guess some teachers don't react well to teleportation), but attracts the attention of Dr. Abram Storm, biological father of Johnny and adopted father of Sue (this shows how lazy the writing was in how to explain why Sue is white and Johnny is black; literally, the explanation is Reed asking Sue ""You adopted?"" and sue going ""Yeah."" And that's all we get.)These four, along with soon to be enemy Victor von Doom, also a kid, but older than the four, will travel to this alternate dimension, where they will get their powers and become the Fantastic Four and Dr. Doom (except neither of these phrases is ever said.)As far as a story goes, it falls short as an origin story because more than half the film is devoted to showing how they get their powers but not even five minutes to showing them develop their powers. Also, Dr. Doom, the main nemesis, shows up so late in the film it feel like it was tacked on to give the film a reason for being. Finally, the ending is virtually copy and pasted from Avengers: Age of Ultron (if you've seen it, you can already imagine what it looks like.)This is not to say that as a superhero movie it doesn't fulfill its main purpose of being a fun escape for 90 minutes or so. In fact, it has many attributes that make it a decent movie. However, the problem is that we consciously recognize those elements as being from other, much better films.In the end, I would say that the trash talk going around is from super comic book fanatics throwing a temper tantrum. It is a good movie, go see it.Just don't think too hard.",Fantastic Four
260,JontheLobsterLover,Fantastically Boring,3,16 August 2015,"I'm going to start off by saying that I had no problem with the race change of Johnny Storm. I hate to bring that up, but with much of the hate for this movie stemming from that it needs to be said. The biggest problem with this movie is that is just incredibly boring. You spend a lot of the time listening to the characters babble. For a comic book movie I was expecting just a little bit more action. Doesn't have to be over the top, but give us a little bit more than 20 minutes of it. Besides The Thing I really felt no emotion or connection to any other character. I actually felt bad for The Thing, I felt sympathy for him. Everyone else felt like they were stuck up their own asses, and you could really care less about them. I did think the graphics were especially cool, and the last 20 minutes or so when they actually fight Dr. Doom I especially enjoyed. That brings up another thing I enjoyed. Seeing Dr. Doom in the last act was IMHO pretty cool. His look, his power, the way he had no sympathy for anyone but himself and just killed people. Loved it. The movie has very few fun and cool elements to it. Other than that, believe me it is incredibly boring.",Fantastic Four
261,DrewAlexanderR1,Far From Fantastic,3,28 August 2015,"I waited to see this movie in theaters to have the experience by myself without others' reactions imposed on me. I didn't read too much about the film other than it was bad. I didn't delve into the reasons why it was bad because I wanted to give the movie a clean shot. It was terrible. The film seemed like a long TV pilot episode that should never for any reason see the light of air time or ever be considered to develop. The dark story that the film was going for didn't work out. The movie was only an hour and forty minutes. There was no time to focus and develop characters and story. It seemed as if the movie had scenes that were haphazardly cut together without any sort of flow or structure. The director Josh Tank (Chronicle) made this look like a comic geek's student film with a big budget. Tank came out and said that the studio forced harsh restrictions on him, but even if this movie was an hour longer I don't think it would help. Not only is the story terrible the dialogue is cringe-worthy. The actors in this film seemed hollow and shallow. Since the dialogue is so bad I don't think they were given anything to work with.Now the one thing I read that gave the movie some credit was it's special effects. There was one scene, the new dimension, that had decent effects and you see it in the trailer. The rest looked like today's CGI techniques were used on a Windows 95.While Fantastic Four had potential to be another great superhero flick it failed disastrously. What the film ultimately lacked was direction and plot. The story felt forced and chopped together; and, the actors seemed unable to bring energy to their characters with the dialogue. The CGI wasn't good and there's not much left to have any positives. Some of it was entertaining but it was far from fantastic.",Fantastic Four
262,spokanegolfer,Not worth the time!,3,20 August 2016,"I love the Fantastic 4! The comic books, the cartoons, and the movies! That is all movies, with the exception of this one. Truth be known, I am still trying to figure out what it was. This movie was about 5 kids who are gifted, don't make friends and play nice with others. Instead, they read, work, study, and create all of the time. That is, except for Ben. Ben is rather a social outcast because he is the junkyard kid and he is abused by his family. The writing/story line/etc., is just off. I am not sure if this is what the director intended, or if the director didn't know what he was doing. Aside from a poorly developed story, I have problems watching the movie. The suits that they wear are developed after they come back from the 4th dimension. Reed runs away after coming back from the 4th dimension. The government searches all over the world to find him, unsuccessfully. Finally, with Sue's help, they find Reed and pick him up. When they do he is wearing the fantastic 4 suit. It just doesn't track well and I feel asleep watching it the first time.",Fantastic Four

Susan storm who's brother to Johnny, however in the film she has a step brother who's black I ain't racist it's the fact they changed the story lines to the remake, also they changed the storyline again to when they get there powers from the space trip to teleporting to another planet. This is such a boring storyline. Again..: they changed it Dr. dooms powers in this film it shows him to be 20x power powerful with GREEN glowing telekinesis, his powers is to manipulate electric with his armour which he doesn't have. The story in this film is so tedious. When Stan Lee doesn't make a cameo you know it's really bad.",Fantastic Four
264,Pulpthatsfiction,Another Faluire in the Fantastic Four Film Franchise,3,19 August 2015,"The Fantastic Four is a series that can't get any love from Hollywood. This is the third attempt from 20th century fox and once again they fall flat on their face. I don't know why 20th can't get there act together to make a descent Fantastic Four film but they can't.Which is sad because I think Chronicle(Josh Trank's first film) was a superhero film classic, I think it's a great example of a super hero film. When I heard of the cast and the director that would be be making this film, I got excited. I think I got blind sided like 20th century fox did when they got this cast and crew together. Because from reports about the production it seems like 20th did nothing as the film was being made and it was quite clear that Josh Trank didn't know or was just overwhelmed by the production of the film. It almost seems like it wasn't even the same director that made Chronicle and this film, because they are the complete opposite in terms of quality.They were able to get very talented actors, they do their best, but even then they seem lost and feel like they are being directed by a director that doesn't know what to do. The talented cast includes Milles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordon, Jaime Bell, and Reg E. Cathey are cast well but when you are not being directed probably and not given a vision, even the greatest actors can't give a proper performance.The first question that came in my head when I left this movie was, ""They did they even get an editor for this film?"" This film has no pacing and editing. It seems like a rough ensemble cut with the studio just cutting out what they didn't like about the film. The film has no character development, scenes just begin and end with no development or the plot being moved forward. You have a great cast and the director just wastes there talent just to fill in exposition or just slightly move the story forward. That's another problem with the film is that it doesn't move forward fast enough or even at all really. It takes forever to get started and the moment the story goes somewhere it ends and all of the studio re-shoots get in the way.Speaking of re-shoots you can tell the studio destroyed what ever ""vision"" Josh Trank had for this film. There are some shots that are just beautiful and capture the characters very well. especially with The Thing and Sue Storm. You can see a glimmer of the vision idea almost shine through in the first act but by the time the third act hits the film makes no sense. It seems like even the actors have just given up on the film and so has everyone behind the camera.I saw the film earlier today and I can tell you that I'm already forgetting what happened in the film. It's just forgettable and bland. Form start to finish the film is one note and it's not a very pleasant note. Hopefully 20th Century Fox gives up the film rights or just shelves any future project because they clearly have no idea to make a Fantastic Four film.1.5/4 Stars",Fantastic Four
265,Kareneo,"Don't believe the haters, this movie is fine!",10,12 September 2015,"I really don't understand what all the fuss is about. Perhaps people were expecting something akin to Guardians of the Galaxy? Sure, the final third of the movie may be a little be a bit less well-rounded than the first portion of the movie (my guess is that happened when the studio interfered with the editing process and would no longer let Trank have his way) and to be fair to some of the nay-saying reviews, the final scene was a bit cringeworthy but if you have been letting the rest of the movie carry you along, then even this scene works in a sort of cheesy 'so-bad-it's-good' way. My only conclusion is that johnny-come-latelys to the superhero genre have been spoiled by some of the outrageously high quality of films like GotG and The Avengers, so they all cry 'waaaa' when a superhero film of above average-ness comes along. I mean, let's be honest, most feature films don't come close to being above average, with the largest proportion of films I see in a year being only around the 4 star mark, so this movie is at least a hold-your-head high 7 out of 10, and that's a win! To summarize? Don't let the negative reviews stop you from watching a film that is wa-ay better than most of the pap you'll see from 2015.",Fantastic Four

I appreciated its slightly darker tone. Maybe it wasn't incredible but it sure kept me involved most of the time.
The origin/back story went a long time, which I actually like in movies, but it did make the second half of the movie feel a little rushed. It wasn't a long movie so they could have put a little more in the second half after all the origin was done with.I don't want to compare it to MCU movies and amazing films like the Dark Knight trilogy, it's a stand alone film that should be credited in its own merits.
A decent to good movie.
I preferred it to the previous two F4 movies, as I found them a little childish (adventurous and still fun) but this was a different take on F4 and I personally appreciated it.",Fantastic Four

268,michaeljpfitzgerald,Offensively bad,1,6 August 2016,"I don't think you can make a movie like this unless you really, truly dislike the content - and harbor a great deal of enmity towards anyone who might like it. The effort necessary to get everything wrong, to miss every beat, to offend every memory that someone might have that would inspire them to go risk *another* attempt at this franchise; that has to come from a place of real disgust, I think. What is amazing is how regularly that kind of pointed loathing seems to be given the reigns of properties that an audience really cares about. Aside from the deep spiritual mistreatment - which is difficult, given how weird and wobbly the Fantastic Four are, to begin with - the pacing is poisonous, with the bulk of the film dedicated to what feels like an attempt at an involved origin story, but where the characters aren't really given anything to do, or to care about. In an attempt to avoid being explicit with motivations, I think, the characters instead limp around under the shadow of intentions - maybe Johnny is upset with his dad? Maybe Ben is looking for purpose? It's possible Richards spent his time in exile trying to help his friends? It's hard to say - better filmmaking could have answered these questions subtly. It didn't happen here.This is a joyless, uninteresting movie, with a cast that looked like they were waiting for something else to start, and I don't understand how they could spend all that money on a movie that looks this bad - designs, to sets, special effects; it's all incredibly dated and generic. One of the worst movies I've ever watched.",Fantastic Four

273,l-62911,This film might make you hate everything about the FF!,1,18 December 2016,"The Fantastic Four still haven't got a good movie! Can't you believe it? First Roger Corman tried making one but didn't bother releasing it and when we did finally see it, it was pretty darn awful. Then Fox had a go with the 2005 series and even though the two films we got were okay I wouldn't go out of my way to call them the best superhero flicks ever.Yet here we are with another attempt to bring the superhero family to the big screen and make no bones about it.... this film is absolute vomit.An unbearable amount of awfulness is what awaits you in this all singing, all dancing (certainly not any of those) 100 minute explosion which goes out of it's way to ruin everything you know and love about The Fantastic Four.All the characters are dull and uninteresting. You won't even care when our four main heroes get their powers because the script is that appallingly written, all you can do is kick back and laugh at every single word that comes out of the actor's mouths.Acting is almost non-existent, these characters don't even feel like humans. They feel more like dead walking zombies to me. Even everyone looks bored on the poster itself.The CG is absolutely atrocious, this film was released in 2015 yet these effects look more right at home on a PlayStation 2 or Xbox game. No even better, they look better on a Commodore Amiga.The film is incredibly rushed due to the 100 minute running time leaving little to no time for development for anyone. (Not that you'll want any because all these characters are as dull as someone's shiny forehead.) Even Doctor Doom looks so retarded and ugly you'll want to punch him right in the face. (You ain't got nowt on Julian McMahon)And to think that Marvel cancelled the comic book series for this...It's clear that Fox just doesn't know how to make a good FF film and just like Steven Seagal needs to stop making all those crap straight to DVD films we've seen 8 billion and fifty nine times before, Fox just needs to give up and give the FF back to Marvel where they'll be able to do justice.Or maybe the FF is unfilmable.I don't know, nevertheless avoid this disaster of a film at all costs otherwise you'll end up hating the Fantastic Four for the rest of your miserable life.",Fantastic Four
274,fabiolpinheiro1993,"One of the worst films ever, the worst comic book movie ever. The great cast it's the saving grace of this film.",4,7 August 2015,"When Fox announced that they would reboot FF with the director of one of my all time favorite films, Chronicle, i was hugely excited. Then the teaser trailer seemed pretty good.Bun then things started to get complicated, the trailers seemed just bland and uninteresting, the director seemed to getting highly negative buzz, and now i know what happened with him and the star wars drama. He was fired. And thank God for that! What a disappointment with a director that showed so much potential with his first film. I wouldn't want him anywhere near Star Wars!And then the horrible, terrible, no good, very bad reviews came out, one after another. But i went to the theater, just for curiosity, to get my own opinion and mainly because i'm very stubborn. And...This is probably the worst comic book movie ever made. And one of the worst films ever made too. I mean it's watchable, but only for one reason, the cast. They are the saving grace of this film, and its a shame such great actors are wasted in this. They try to make what they can with what they have, which is nothing.The film has a first few minutes that while not good, are satisfying to some extent, and while the buildup is just plain ""what the hell were they thinking?!"" it passed, and OK i don't mind, but when this buildup lasts for an hour in an 1 hour and half movie, i think it pretty much says everything. I mean OK, they could keep this strange buildup if the film was a lot longer and had at least a resemblance to a pay off, but...No. I think the script is definitely the worst thing in this film, by far. Its one of the worst scripts ever written. Let me tell you what happens in an hour: Reed builds something, Ben helps him because, no one believes him, 7 years pass, someone believes them, they build a bigger version of that something, they travel to a terrible planet or whatever because they are drunk, they get the powers, and 1 year goes by. All of this moves at snail speed.One of the worst things is how they focus on everything they shouldn't, the most mundane things! Then when they should focus on the highly interesting ideas and stuff that happened in that 1 year after for example, they don't. They basically say all that in a previously on FF under 30s type of thing, and its so much stuff! Like The thing working for the military, on numerous missions, which would be awesome to see, but no. Or what happened to Reed. Then they return to the planet, the villain appears for 5 minutes, a rushed, stupid, dumb climax and the film is over.To call the script uninspired, lazy, dumb as hell, a piece of crap, wouldn't be enough to say how bad it is. There's no plot, no character development or something that resembles this, no logic, really there's no logic or sense in anything in this script, the dialogue is just soooo bad and odd, that forces the actors to look awkward as hell. Then there's an action scene, really i'm not kidding, one action scene that qualifies as such, in the last 5 minutes. And its bad, really bad. This couldn't be further from being a comic book movie or a blockbuster, this just seems like a bad documentary or something. The visual effects are great, the production design is meh at best, the score is fine, i mean the composer could do much with this material. The sound is meh at best and the cinematography i think it's fine, a little darker, but its fine.But you know, i don't blame the director, because no matter how terrible his direction is, or how terrible his vision is, thats his vision, period. I blame the Studio, Fox. Because how on earth could they read this script and greenlight it?! How?! Just how?! And how did they spent 120 million on a film that seems to take place in a warehouse the entire film with nothing happening?! They should have hired a director that presented them a great script and vision. But I guess not. How could Fox believe this would be a great remake?! I will never know. This is one of the most odd, strangest, awkward, mundane, dull, weird, films ever made. They could develop tons of important things, and there's some good ideas, but i guess the film then would have like 2h or something and that would be just stupid. 0 plot, 0 development, 0 characterization, The thing appears for 5 minutes, and Ben is just there because, the villain appears for 5 minutes and he's, bad? i guess. People say things they never do, people do things wee never see, people talk about things they should never talk about, we see things that no one cares about. What a stupid film.

It would have been cool if they'd gone down the grotesque X-Files' Eugene Tooms style route of gross, greasy, sinister hypermobility.The Fantastic Four comics really deserve a high camp, fun for the family treatment, a la Guardians of the Galaxy, to do it justice, not the unhinged ramblings of a 13 year old emo trapped in the body of a director with the budget of a small country.I've read that Tommy Wiseau (The Room) expressed an interest in doing a sequel to this which sounds like it genuinely would be fantastic, heaps of demented Troma type fun and definitely something I'd pay good money to see.",Fantastic Four
280,dimbost,MCU killing good movies for good,5,19 August 2015,"Before i went to see this film, i saw all of the negative reviews and the shocking 3.2 rating on IMDb... So i went there to see what was so wrong with the film.Fantastic Four, is an underrated comic universe movie, that does not deserve so much negativity. F4 has a an interesting take on the origins of the F4 team, and probably one of the most complicated and relatable villains in Comic-book universe, but apparently no one saw that. So, we have Iron man 3's Aldrich Killian who is just a nerd, that becomes a super villain because he got stood up by Tony, Avengers 2 Ultron, is just a robot, that wants to destroy the world because humans don't have the capacity to live together, but instead of creating chaos through his ability to manipulate any and all software he decides to take a village far enough into the sky to drop it. I guess all of the Nukes that Russia, U.S.A, China, North Korea and other countries isn't enough. F4 villain is Victor Von Doom, while the 2005 was a cliché Rich guy out looking for revenge because he didn't get the world. This Victor Von Doom, is against Corporation corruption, societies lack of empathy for destroying our own planet, and Government manipulation. If you break down his character he actually becomes a anti hero and a villain per-say. He only tries to destroy Earth after the Corporation makes the deal with the government to try and create bunch of super soldiers and exploit the 4th dimension, and killing that planet. Victor was never shown as a simple bad guy out for revenge, instead he always expressed his concern and his hatred for corruption, pollution and people being used. So in terms of the Villains F4 did a great job.Now the only sort of negative thing i can say about the film, or agree with others, is that the chemistry just wasn't there between the actors, and the origins of some of the characters was bad. Johnny Storm felt completely out of tune with the rest of them, so did Ben Grimm. Victor and Reed had the best chemistry by far. So those are my only two criticisms about the film, the origins and exploration of some of the characters and actors chemistry on screen. I can also throw in there, the ""How they got their powers"" thing. It was kinda lame, but F4 is the much more out there comic series. I think this movie got such a low review, because it was serious and that made it seem out of place. People are now use to having Marvel films make fun of themselves, having inside jokes about their own existence, where F4 took more of a DC road. F4 was presented as a more serious and dark toned comic book film.",Fantastic Four
281,CinematicGarbage,The Worst of the Worsts Marvel Movies and the Worsts owned by FOX!,1,4 May 2019,"Fant4stic (2015), directed by Josh Trank, is one of the superhero movie remakes which are always concerned to have better special effects than the previous versions of them but this movie turned out to be much different than other remakes. It's so BAD! Almost everything in here sucks!
The acting was also one of the problems that turned Fant4stic into a...Fantastic Four parody starring Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, Michael B. Jordan as Human Torch? I mean that character in this movie was nothing like in the comics. Blonde hair, white skin but in here black hair and black skin. You got the wrong cast! Also Victor Von Doom looked like a piece of turd. He was more like a parody character and spoke like a character in a parody. Everything he did was funny. His hood and cape made him a bigger turd. He looked completely worse than Dr. Doom in Fant4stic (2005).
The plot was a complete MESS! People didn't want to spoil plots to others but the thing is this movie doesn't have anything to spoil! The Fant4stic got their powers, Dr. Doom came and created his new universe and they had to stop them which they succeeded. This plot was almost the worst of the worsts. There were more significant stuffs from the comics that they didn't take: humor, joy,... I barely laughed at this movie, like there's nothing funny at all. I only laughed at the terrible CGI they had done.
The visual effects was thought to be the best of the movie but then it was opposite. It was also one of the worsts about this movie. The background's okay but the CGI was quite cheesy. I mean look what they had done to Reed's arm when he stretched it. It looked so bad (as bad as a movie from the 90s trying to use CGI that wasn't invented yet like The Mummy Returns (the Scorpion King looked like something we wanted to laugh at, not to fear)). Even though thi movie was owned by FOX, nothing could be done greatly.
I really wanted to like the movie, but there was nothing to like, nothing to be impressed. We are talking about superheroes, not science projects and this movie, it took most of the minutes about science projects here and science projects there. There's too much. The superheroes time was so short like only half an hour when Doom came back and the Fant4stic tried to stop him.

283,xristoff93,Confusing outcome,5,11 September 2016,"I like marvel movies so here I thought""let's watch this""...When the movie was over I was confused and didn't really know what to feel about it.It had some good moments but also had many things I had to continuously think about and that wouldn't allow me to go with it.First of all,someone's gonna have to tell Hollywood to drop that anti racist strategy.They made it about race the moment they felt they had to put a black human torch in there,in order not to make people say they are racists.So should we be expecting a black green goblin or wolverine in the future?Com'on!So in the movie 12 years a slave we must cast a white guy,in order not to be racist in the reverse....jeezSusan storm was almost an outsider.For some time I actually thought victor would be a part of the fantastic 4 and not Susan.The way she got her powers was like ""let enough energy spill out of the machine just to get her infected with super-powers,then shut it off"".Ben looks like a diseased gorilla,walking around naked,despising Rid or being a friend from afar.They are supposed to be pretty close to each other and I did not see or felt that anywhere.There was some hints about Doom's feeling towards Susan,but no Rid-Susan thing?Only a vague idea of it and I got it mostly due to the previous movies.Doom fakes an injury,comes back to Earth and then blasts off again deciding to destroy it.No thunder,just some elfen-lied kinda thing and moving rocks.WHAT WAS THAT?There were some great visual effects,some funny moments and even some moments with feeling.But the thing is,having the movie being finished I am left with only a few images of the fantastic 4.Didn't really see them,definitely didn't catch myself feeling worried about how they would make it,and apparently the directors felt the same way since they had them to just blast off in the opposite to planet's zero direction in order to return to Earth.Some physics right there...We had no Stan lee cameo and no after the credits scene.The bad thing is that the cast-even black torch-was great and they were making it very easy for you to feel for them,but the story line wouldn't allow the connection between audience and cast to be established.The heroes didn't have the forms we loved,the villain too(looked more like a cyborg),no Ben-Johnny conflicts except for the last biased line between them,the music was a bit uninspiring,the protagonists were not so much protagonists,Susan seemed to have a problem with one of her eyes when she was looking towards the camera(that was weird),no superhero names,no explanation for their powers nor how they started mastering them,just straight ahead working for the government,that's America for you.....And what was up with that bureaucrat government guy?Did he have a mouth twitch or did he have gum in his mouth every time he made a speech?So weird.....All in all,some potential,good cast,but poor story-line and a lot of biased decisions for originality's sake.We do not want original,we want Fantastic 4...It gets a 5/10 from me.....",Fantastic Four
284,zwjonas,Not That Bad,6,25 September 2021,This movie doesnt quite deserve the disrespect it gets. Its not a great movie by any means and inferior to the older version but it has some good acting and fine dialogue. The casting is acceptable. Some small and medium size plot holes. The villian is done really poorly in the second half of the movie. He looks stupid and his powers make no sense. The last fight scene ending is a little dull. I wouldnt want to see a sequel.,Fantastic Four
285,TheFunkyBass,Fant4stic Suck,3,4 June 2016,"This movie was one of the most disappointing movies I've ever watched. I remember I was actually excited when this movie was announced because I'm a big fan of the comic book. But after watching it, I felt betrayed. Betrayed because I defended it online from haters that started shitting on it by just watching the trailers. The truth is, this film was a disaster, and here's why:1) No chemistry. You couldn't feel like any of the actors liked each other. You didn't feel any kind of bond between them. The Fantastic Four are supposed to be a family. This felt nothing like that at all.2) No character development. Or at least, it had a shitty one for all of them. You really didn't care for what ever happened to any of the main cast.3) Bad pacing. Some scenes looked really out of place and unnecessary.4) Boring as f@#k. This movie was not entertaining at all. I don't remember enjoying any part of it.5) Origin story butchered. This was supposed to be an adaptation of the Ultimate Fantastic Four written by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Millar. I saw little to no resemblance to the comic book. It was completely unfaithful to their Ultimate comic counterpart. 6) What the hell happened in Act II and III? Around the second half of the movie, the film took a twist in a totally unnecessary way. And the third act of the movie was one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a movie.7) Terrible CGI. The whole movie looked like CGI crapfest. But the scene that took the price was when Mr. Fantastic had the ""face- lift"".8) Horrible villain. Doom looked like manure. When I saw him on the trailers, I thought to myself he would look better on the actual film, but no, he looked even worse in the movie.",Fantastic Four
286,phantom_pixie,Not fantastic at all,5,22 September 2015,"I had no expectations on this film. I mainly watched it because of the talent that is Miles Teller. But Teller can not carry this film alone. Teller and Jordan have had great chemistry in previous work, in this film some of it could be seen, but most of the time the lines seem forced and fake. That goes for anyone involved in the project. This film was not fantastic at all, if anything it was really bland. All characters comes off as one-dimensional and with no real connection at all. It feels like you could have replaced any of them at any time and it wouldn't have mattered for the film. There was really nothing new or original, as this film comes off just as a copy of the directors previous work and every single event is coming in on the obvious-train. A person who haven't read the comic could still guess the events and actions in this film, from beginning till end.This is not the reboot you are looking for. Move along.",Fantastic Four
287,Mars-3038,Lacks creativity,6,4 April 2021,"It's very predictable. They missed an opportunity to really showcase these characters in another light, one we haven't seen before. That being said, I did enjoy this movie, it's oddly relaxing.",Fantastic Four
288,roblesar99,Doomed,3,8 August 2015,"Since it was announced, Fantastic Four has been the subject of media scrutiny and overwhelmingly negative reception from hardcore fans of the series and the general public. Everything from Michael B. Jordan's casting as the Human Torch to director Josh Trank's on-set troubles, which included showing up to work both drugged out and late, as well as reportedly verbally abusing Kate Mara to the point where she cried, had given the film a bad reputation several months before it was to be released. It's a surprise the film even made it to cinemas on time considering the massive amounts of reshoots that supposedly took place after the film had already completed principal photography. Those reshoots were completely for naught, however, because nothing, except perhaps Trank's original vision for the film, could have saved this trainwreck of a reboot, which was only made to prevent Marvel from obtaining the rights. It goes without saying that this film will be studied for years to come, but not because of what went right, but because of what went so terribly wrong.The film tells the tale of the Fantastic Four, a group of young 20- somethings who crack inter-dimensional travel and acquire superpowers when they travel to this alternate dimension (known as Planet Zero) and are exposed to its elements. Simple? Not quite. Nearly the entire film is devoted to exposition and as so, we are given countless scenes that fail to push the film forward. This scenes try to explain the film's science and develop the film's characters, but instead end up making the film's story feel muddled and dull. In fact, the expository dialogue is so clunky that even though the main actors try to do their best what has been given to them by Trank and co-writers Jeremy Slater and Simon Kinberg (who wrote the actually fantastic X-Men: Days of Future Past), they only amplify its clunkiness. Because the film attempts to be as serious as possible, he attempts at humor end up falling short and I only chuckled once or twice during the film's 100-minute runtime. The film's biggest grievance, however, is how pedestrian it truly is. Every single story beat has been spoiled by the trailers and therefore, the film falls to trite predictability.The only thing that keeps the film watchable is the cast, despite that none of them even approach the level of success they have had on previous productions. The quite underrated Jamie Bell is perhaps the best member of the team as Ben Grimm. Unfortunately, he also gets the least screen time of the four. On the other hand, Miles Teller, fresh off the success of one 2014's best films, Whiplash, barely convinces as Reed Richards. Michael B. Jordan, who was at the center of much controversy because he was cast in the role of the typically white character Johnny Storm, is in the end, unremarkable. The other Storm sibling, portrayed by Kate Mara, is also unremarkable, and spends the majority of her time either staring at a screen or failing to develop much chemistry with her co-stars. However, it is Toby Kebbell who takes the cake in regards to the film's worst performance. Cast as the film's main villain, Victor von Doom, Kebbell fails to make him menacing in any type of way, and ultimately, makes one wish that they were watching Julian McMahon's Dr. Doom from 2005 instead.However, although Kebbell is partly to blame for the failings of Dr. Doom, blame should also fall on the editing and visual effects departments. The film's pacing is completely off-the-mark, and certain characters simply disappear for long periods of time. Even though I am not an advocate for action over story, the uneven editing left me yearning for some action - until I finally got it late in the third act. However, the action, just like the story, is muddled and dull, and fails to take advantage of both the powers of Dr. Doom and the Fantastic Four. The climactic battle really isn't that much of a climax at all, and wholeheartedly disappoints. The film's visual effects make matters even more disappointing. Although I liked the design of The Thing, it says something when the design of Dr. Doom was better a decade ago than it is now.It actually pained me to write such a negative review for this film. Since the release of the first trailer, I had been cautiously optimistic, despite the fact that negative publicity seemed to leak every day. Trank's directorial debut, Chronicle, had been a pleasant surprise, and despite my skepticism about the overall cast, I believed that Trank could finally give the Fantastic Four the film they finally deserved. But alas, the day when that happens still isn't here. There are great ideas every now and then, but they never seem to gel into something cohesive. Plagued by an unimaginative story which seems to confuse exposition for dialogue, so-so special effects, poor character development, a final act that's weaker than its villain, and a never-ending sense of predictability, Fantastic Four is one of the worst superhero films to come out in a long time. We'll never how much of the film has been changed by Fox from Josh Trank's version, but perhaps the film would've been better had they left it in his hands.Miles Teller was right when he said that ""this is not a movie (that) we're going to go on Rotten Tomatoes and it's going to be at 80 or 90%"". This is a movie that's going to be at 9%.",Fantastic Four
289,zdflanders,Far From Perfect but Not Nearly as Bad as You've Heard,6,13 July 2020,"I truly believe that if no one had ever heard of the Fantastic Four, this would've been a success. Like are you telling me you didn't think the first half of this movie was intriguing at all? Because I think everyone was really enjoying this movie until they botched the last half of it. Majority of the hate is from people trying to trend and over exaggerating. If I had to compare this to anything, I think it closely resembles the structure of Batman V Superman. It's full of well directed and scripted scenes in the first acts but leaves something to be desired as it progresses. This is the result of trying to build a group of characters from the ground up, and then forcing in a conflict capable of being in an entirely separate movie. For Batman V Superman, it was Doomsday. For Fantastic Four, it was Dr. Doom. I really don't think it was enough to ruin the movie. It just keeps it from being perfect. Audiences are so quick to jump to trends. Like in B. V. S., everyone was hating on that movie for the first few weeks of its release, then all of the sudden, the merchandise sells out like crazy and everyone boards the trend of Ben Affleck's Batman being the greatest. It's the same thing with Fantastic Four. It was given hate during its initial release except it never got bigger given it's relevancy to the MCU died instantaneously being as it was Sony rather than Disney where as Batman V Superman was a starter for the Justice League universe. Also the Fantastic Four isn't nearly as popular as Batman or Superman despite being extremely well known.Without a doubt, this certainly had a darker tone than the previous Fantastic Four films and even the comics. Personally I liked the changes they made. The Thing and The Human Torch working as government assassins made them more interesting in my opinion. Same with Susan and Johnny being able to do hands on work with Reed Richards. It adds more to their personalities and gives them more to do then just following Mr. Fantastic and adding comic relief when need be. It just works better with a more modern audience.I think you should give this a shot if you found this movie even moderately intriguing. It's not a complete train reck like the critics are making it out to be. Also the MCU definitely stole Thing's design for Korg in Thor. Both Korg and Thing are designed differently in the comics but the MCU straight up took the Sony Thing's design. I don't know why no one mentions this.",Fantastic Four
290,RikerDonegal,Dull. Directionless. Storyless. Humourless. Pointless.,4,7 August 2015,"Dull. Directionless. Storyless. Humourless. Pointless. Almost no action. Nothing like the comic book series.Miles Teller is good, but he is the only cast member who gets a chance to do anything. The other three are relegated to support roles.The first two-thirds of the movie are all about research. Seriously.The first action scenes (of The Thing in battle) take place off-screen. Off-screen. Seriously. It's like a cruel joke on the audience. We sat there and watched Reed sit in a lab for over an hour and when the team finally get their powers we are told by a secondary character about all the missions that Ben Grimm is going on. And we see the mission footage on a screen, in the background, while he is talking. In a film of bizarre choices, this is surely one of the most odd.The Ben/Johnny relationship - a key element of the FF appeal - is relegated to one throwaway line in the final minute of the film. It is, I think, the only line of dialogue between the characters in the whole film.Reed escapes at the midpoint of the film. He is soon recaptured after a brief (almost-)action sequence. The escape is meaningless. It accomplishes nothing, and adds nothing to the (non-)story in progress.Nothing that Doom says or does in the final minutes makes sense, but this is probably the worse: he walks through the complex killing everybody he meets. And when confronted by Reed and the other three he simply pushes them away. He does not kill them. Yet, as far as we can tell, the only character is truly dislikes is Reed. So, instead of killing him when he can, he knocks him over and pushes he against a wall.Based on this boring film I'm assuming Josh Trank has NEVER read the comic book series which is frequently fun, always has action and story and likable characters.4/10",Fantastic Four
291,Zettelhead,"Focus on the characters, not on the FX",10,14 September 2015,"I rated this movie with 10 because it absolutely does not deserve a rating of 4.0! If you want to have a giant battle of sfx and cgi, some funny one-liners and the usual militaristic propaganda, watch Avengers: Age of Ultron or Guardians of the Galaxy or similar crap.If you want convincing and developing characters, a well written script, good dialogues, an excellent cast, a great musical score and an attitude that rejects the militaristic habitus in general, this one is for you.This is storytelling without telling too much. We have four troubled kids, but their background is not overdrawn at all. There are just some little hints: the impressive face of Miles Teller and the laconic remark ""My parents weren't interested"" tell a story that needs no staged melodrama. Likewise the problematic relation between Johnny Storm and his father.Talking about Johnny Storm: the movie makers made him afro-American and used the character to illustrate the perfidious habit of the US military to enlist young black men with poor social background and dull prospects.Of the background of Victor von Doom we also just get some glimpse, not the whole story. There obviously had been some incidents and you always feel them under the surface, but it is not necessary for the story to know all the details.The only flaw is the showdown. It comes to rash, the characters that had some serious problems of trusting each other bond again too fast and the solution in fighting Doom comes as well too fast, too linear and too easy. Just ten minutes more of suffering and trying to sort out their personal issues and the problem ""Doom"" would have done it.I hope they will not drop this because of unbelievable bad rating! Because Miles Teller is the very best Richard Reed of all times!",Fantastic Four
292,PandoraProductions4,not as bad as people are saying....but still bad,5,20 August 2015,"After hearing all the negative hype about this movie, I was expecting it to be a lot worse than it was. There were actually enjoyable elements in it. I liked how the tone was darker than the average comic book movie. The beginning starts out promising. Then the minutes start to go by and little to nothing happens. The characters were flat and boring, and so was the acting. I'd be OK with that as long as the film had something else going for it, but it didn't. It was just focusing on these characters who had no chemistry together, who didn't seem like friends, just like actors pretending to be friends. None of the relationships had any depth. Reed and Ben are supposed to be great friends, yet Ben seems indifferent to Reed. There's a quasi-romantic subplot that's given barely any airtime. Maybe that's for the best because it was really forced. Then, a hour in I might add, they get their powers and cut to: ""one year later"" Why??!! So dumb. We don't get to see enough of what any of them can do. The special effects are.... passable at times, but not great. The CGI monkey looked really fake. It was only on screen for like a few seconds. Couldn't they have gotten a real monkey? When Reed stretched his face it looked like something out a Doctor Who episode. The classic series. You can tell that Miles Teller actually thought he was in a good movie in the first twenty minutes or so. Then later on, he looks like he just wants to get his scenes over so he can go back to his trailer. The visual effect/action scenes involve a lot of looking at tennis balls on poles, while in front of a greenscreen. There's not much art to it. The last fight scene feels tacked on and pointless, the stakes don't feel high. And how the Fantastic Four come together in the end is so anti-climatic. There's no ""Yes! Let's do this!"" moment, just a lot of unhappy looking actors saying their poorly written lines. And that last scene, where they're all joking around, completely undermines the darker tone they were kind of trying for. Though the movie has something going for it: The scene where Doom walks through the hallway and makes peoples' heads explode was amazing. That's one of the most memorable scenes I've seen in a movie this year. I'm not kidding. And the music behind it was like a dissonant pounding. I loved it. That element of horror really worked. They should have expanded on that. But nope, here we have a movie that basically exists to set-up another movie that no one will want to see. So, to summarize, the characters sucked, the special effects and action scenes were mediocre, barely anything happened, but there was one awesome scene.",Fantastic Four

The four must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy.Fox should have sold the film rights back to Disney before making this movie. Yes, that's how I feel about this film. Yes, I didn't mind the 2005 film; it wasn't great but I liked the campieness and how ridiculous it was. I liked the Things practical costume it gave homage to the Roger Corman film. That being said, this new Fantastic Four movie has an updated and darker tone; on paper the film should awesome, but it's not.This cast should be awesome but I felt no chemistry between them. You think putting a younger group of actors together would give this film a fresh take, it didn't. Not for one minute did I believed that any of the cast were the Fantastic Four. The Thing looks good but the voice doesn't fit and the one design that I couldn't stand was Dr. DOOM (never named Dr. Doom in this film). Instead of a mask we get a C.G. face which makes him look like a metal faced incredible crash dummy.This retelling of the classic comic book franchise is BORING! I struggled to get through this film and when I got to the end the payoff was not worth the 1 hour and 40 minutes of boredom I went through. To top it off, it wraps up so quick I should of just read the comics and I would of got more joy from it. That being said this is a origin story but we needed another one; although they leave it open for a sequel, which if there is I hope it is done by Disney. I tried to enjoy the film but the only thing I didn't hate was the C.G. (beside Dr.Doom). This movie wasn't worth the time I spent trying to watch it.

295,BecauseIAmBATMAN,Not absolutely awful,5,15 August 2015,"I was expecting something absolutely terrible, but I got an interesting sci-fi drama with a few cringeworthy moments. But it definitely has a lot of problems. The vision was definitely unfocused/unclear as it turns from an interesting body horror which felt cut short to a government conspiracy film. Then the last 10 minutes kinda sucks as it becomes a clichéd superhero film. Doom had a cool Akira-esque introduction scene but he was an incredibly lame villain. It definitely could have been a lot better if they omitted out the government conspiracy part and fleshed out the body horror aspect of the film which I loved. The biggest weakness of the film is that its a superhero film which is embraced only at the final 10 minutes, it probably would have been decent if it wasn't supposed to be fantastic 4 flick.

298,isaiahwilson15,Now This Is Some High Quality Crap!!!!,1,1 February 2016,"It is almost impossible to imagine that in 2015, as movie audiences experience the golden age of superhero movies that there can still be crap like this. Somehow, someway Fant4stic reaches into the depths of awful superhero movies, and takes the crown for being one of the worst superhero movies of all time. Lets start with the lack of story or even a simple plot. For starters, we really aren't even introduced to some resemblance of a plot until an hour into the movie, and even then the plot essentially boils down to Doom sucking a hole out of the earth to somehow build his own planet, which is completely bare. Considering that synopsis, I think it is almost safe to say that this movie doesn't even have a plot (or one that at least makes sense). OK so the movie doesn't have a ""genuine"" plot, that been the case with some other superhero movies. It should at least have some cool action scenes or provide some worthwhile visuals. Nope! I honestly can only recall maybe five minutes of some actual ""action""' and even that was happening, it was absolute crap. There were multiple opportunities throughout the film to showcase their powers, especially in the scene with Reed Richards and Ben Grimm, but instead, all we are left with is crappy one-liners. Even in the last 10 minutes when we get the big battle, it ends up being a boring, uneventful, cliché, and yes crappy letdown. So we've got no story, no action, no villain (I won't even waste my time with Dr. Dumb), how about some witty dialogue or a couple of humorous scenes. Wrong again. In its attempt to be the Dark Knight of FOX superhero movies, Fant4stic is stripped of all the humor and campiness that at least made the earlier Fantastic Four movies watchable. Instead, we get a dark and surprisingly depressing film that doesn't evoke any sense of emotion from the viewer except for boredom. The jokes are laughable (except there not) and just about all the interaction between characters feels forced and inauthentic. OK. So by now you get the idea. Fant4stic is an absolute crap-shoot of a movie. A movie void of a plot, action, and OK dialogue doesn't even deserve to be called by its name, hence the Fant4stic's. It makes the earlier Fantastic Four movies look like The Avengers, and in the end, serves as an embarrassment to anyone associated with the film. And if you were wondering, yes, it is even worse than Batman & Robin. :0",Fantastic Four

This movie was torn about even before the greasy palmed, dishonest movie critics. Unfortunately someone's plans worked and the entertaining of the Fantastic 4 movie was ruined for everyone. I feel bad for anyone who worked hard to make this movie including directors, producers, actors as well as anyone who had been crushed by Hollywood politics Now to give you my brief review. Being from long island I liked how it started out in the small town of oyster bay. I thought going back to the Fantastic 4's childhood was clever and told a good story. Even though it took some time to see a super hero I was entertained and didn't loose interest. Now shooting forward to the action and not spoiling it I thought the effects were amazing and in the same time it always had a decent plot.

301,bardia-moose,Fantastic? Not Even Close,3,16 September 2015,"This movie ain't good. What I'll say is the first half was pretty decent; the characters setups were well written. There were definitely glimmers of hope. However, there was no action, and no real conflicts which made it quite boring. But it was still watchable. And then it all went to hell. This isn't a spoiler, but there's this abrupt time jump near the halfway point of the movie. And it's at this very moment where everything began to fall apart. First of all, not only did this time jump completely skip the best part of origin tales, discovering and testing out your superpowers, but it killed everything good that was set up in the first half. Characters were inconsistent, direction was messy, dialogue became cringe-worthy, and CGI was outright dreadful. The second half honestly felt like a whole other movie; you could sense a whole lot of studio intervention going on. There were scenes in the trailer that that didn't end up in the final product, which tells me that Fox had no faith in their film; basically, they sent this to the editing room to die. My biggest problem with FANATSIC FOUR is that it has no personality whatsoever. There's no fun to be had here, in fact there's nothing to be had since nothing really happens in the movie. I'm shocked by how much this disappointed me, mostly because they got Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, and Jamie Bell; that's a damn good cast right there, and yet none of them added much of anything to their roles. In fact, by the end most of the cast seemed to tune out. Speaking of the end, my God was that third act atrocious. Doom comes out of nowhere and we're suddenly thrown into the finale. Not only was his character design laughable, the guy didn't even feel like a character; his motivation felt like it was written by a 5-year-old. There was no weight to this battle at all, from the forced speeches to the noticeable green screen.

303,kmichaelpm,Do Not Listen To Negative Critics,6,10 September 2015,"I nearly did not look at this movie after listening to the negative critics. However having seen some positive reviews I decided to go with my gut and have a look.I am very glad that I did. This is a good modern twist on the ever resurrected original, and will definitely appeal to the younger moviegoer. I saw nothing whatsoever wrong with the acting, bearing in mind that they are not mega stars. I really thought they did a fine job.The script was what was required for this movie, and the cinematography and effects were excellent. The action is continuous and well paced.If they do make a sequel or a TV series, I for one would be delighted. In fact this is quite a good family movie. The kids will definitely enjoy it.Do yourself a favour and go watch it. You will not be disappointed.",Fantastic Four
304,brendandevere,Unfortunate Four.,4,14 August 2015,"This is an unfortunate film. Unfortunately it was made ($120 million budget), produced and released but to the director's credit I can see what he was trying to achieve. Josh Trank (Chronicle) was given the difficult task of resurrecting the Fantastic Four franchise by giving the audience a far more polished movie than its predecessors by adding grit and realism to the production but the result was a film that lacked emotion, warmth and most important of all, story. It reeked of Generation Y with the characters unable to deliver a believable and engaging performance. Trank was quoted as saying, he had great ideas for this film but there seemed to be interference from the powers above and if that was the case, then the studios only have themselves to blame for delivering the worst Marvel movie in history.Too often the film ran out of ideas and had nowhere to go, then it just ended abruptly. 100 minutes is to short for these types of films but with Fantastic Four being so bad it was actually its only saving grace. It is hard to see that any of the four ""superheroes"" could actually be considered fantastic. I believe Trank was trying to build a story so the studios could release a brilliant sequel by laying down some firm foundations but he was just not able to hit the right note.The film starts by introducing us to a younger version of Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and his best mate Ben (Jamie Bell) that meet in school with Reed already a prodigy in everything science. It's Reed's ability to transport matter to another dimension and then bring it back that grabs the attention of Storm (Reg.E.Cathey) and his adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara). Reed is given a scholarship in New York and with the help of Sue, her brother Johnny (Michael.B.Jordan) and Victor Von Doom, they make inter-dimensional travel a reality. By acting as the first human guinea pigs, Reed, Johnny, Victor and Ben take a little quantum trip and come back with special abilities. On re-entry they lose Victor and Sue consumes some of the alien energy that gives her special abilities as well.Wow! What a story. Unfortunately it doesn't transfer to the screen very well. There are too many gaps in the storyline where the writers have rushed through the script and run out of ideas. The young cast don't connect with the audience and deliver emotionless characters. Reg.E.Cathey tries his best to give his character some feeling but the script limits his performance and the younger actors miss his on screen presence in the second half of the film.Memorable action scenes never really eventuate with Trank focusing more on the visual abilities of the Fantastic Four. The climax with Doom is slotted into a three to five minute battle that is never spectacular with Doom only really wanting to go back to the other dimension before he is rudely interrupted. Just let him go! Then it just ends......how fantastic.",Fantastic Four
305,jackVSjack,"No its not great, but doesn't deserve such a low rating.",6,1 September 2017,"Let's start off by saying that because of it's low rating I have put off watching this until now. As it has just become available to stream on Netflix I thought that I would brave the inevitable disappointment.But I actually didn't think that it is as bad as the lead reviewers are stating in long winded waffles that any normal person only has limited patience to read.Lets cease with the ramblings of your own inflated self importance and try being concise! (A request I am going to no so ironically break) NO clearly this does not match up to many of the other Marvel films that have been produced in the last ten or so years. I'm not going to hail it as so. BUT... I could see elements of they were trying to do and applaud the effort and refrain from condemning it as 4.4 rating.If M Night Shyamalan can continually make ever so increasingly abysmal offerings that all started with The awfully transparent The Sixth Sense. I fail to see the logic of this rating. I would stay this is far far better than the VAST majority of his films.In a world where Avatar, the worlds dullest amalgamation of tired and overtly mind numbing and stupidly stereotypical monstrosities apparently warrants multiple sequels. I fail to comprehend placing this title below a 5.",Fantastic Four
306,westen1223,'Unremarkable Four',5,11 December 2015,"A bit late to review this title.I watched this film in DVD, and I thought this film needed a lot of improvements. The film lacked a bunch of action, its pacing was too much and the structure of the whole film was quite unsatisfying. I hoped the film was going to impress me amidst all the criticism and yet in one scene, nothing have influence me to like this film.The majority of the characters have changed. I thought there was going to be tension between the siblings but all i saw was nothing but lack of humour, especially from Michael. B Jordan who I thought was very hilarious. Not a great film but what I only liked was the special effects. They were actually impressive but sometimes, it just felt like they were fake but still, It was lovely to watch the special effects scenes. Not a film to watch but if you love VFX, this might be the film for you.",Fantastic Four
307,MovieSoup,Why did they reboot this?,3,10 September 2017,"I know at this point it is like flogging a dead horse but this movie is all kinds of terrible. I really did not want to watch this film in the cinema so waited for it to be available on Netflix and thank god I didn't waste £8 on a movie ticket. I only wasted 1 hour and 39 minutes of my life which is much more expendable. Anyway let's get down to the meat and potatoes of this film then.The film starts off really poorly with the worst scene in this film. The school career day scene that makes no sense!! Reed Richards stands at the front of the class and says that he wants to be the first person to invent teleportation. For some reason this really angers his teacher who starts berating him in front of his class (who all look to be different ages and sitting in the exact same position at their desks for some reason). This is something a teacher would never do in a class room and this scene sets the movie up for more fails. The plot is very BORING with nothing exciting happening for 2/3 of the film! In a superhero movie you want the powers to be gained in the first 1/4 not have to sit through 50 minutes of filler until we get to something. The film feels it has to explain everything before we get to the action of the film which is at the far back end of the movie. The plot pacing is all over the place with scenes being rushed forward at inconvenient times to make way for some of the worst character development I have ever seen.The characters in this film have no development what so ever. No one learns anything, the four of them do not even become a proper team that work together and they have no real back and forth with each other. Ben Grimm is thrown into the mix when he is essentially written out of the plot half way through. Sue storm is played by a terrible actress. Kate Mara's performance is flat and she only uses two facial expressions in the entire film (one of them whilst in her force bubble thing). What's more in this film sue storm is adopted and we are told that she is originally from Kosovo or some place? I mention this point because it has sweet FA to do with her characters story arc, her emotional blueprint or anything else. It was just a useless bit of info that we did not need to be explained.Miles Teller was great in whiplash but here he is not helped by a flat, BORING script which gives him nothing to work with and not much character background to feed off. As I said before there is not one single joke between the characters and everyone is so serious (WHY SO SERIOUS??). Even the human torch, who is supposed to be the comic relief, is flat and always seems to be angry at life for some reason. Honestly after watching this movie I sat back thinking that I should cancel my Netflix subscription, the film was that frustrating.The music, cinematography and all other technical things I look for were all lost as I was just distracted by how boring and nonsensical the plot was. I guess if the sound and colour were really bad it would have registered with me but the sound and colour are just like elevator music it just is so unimportant that you don't notice it. Poor writing is what kills this movie for me. Nothing about this films plot is interesting or exciting but at least it doesn't fail on a technical aspect like suicide Squad. This is easily the worst Marvel movie of the 2010's so if I were you I'd give it a miss and watch Avengers instead.",Fantastic Four
308,mhthehammer,"Better than I expected, but not by much",5,28 May 2020,"Back in 2015, I saw a huge cardboard display for the new Fantastic Four movie, and I thought, ""Oh no, is this gonna be one of those movies where it's coated in that ugly desaturated earth and metal tones?"" So, I didn't watch it because I wasn't into Marvel movies in general, but it might be a critical success regardless. However, this movie describing the origins of the team, which includes Mr. Fantastic (Miles Teller), Invisible Girl (Kate Mara), Human Torch (Michael B. Jordan) and Thing (Jamie Bell), and their plot to defeat the evil Dr. Doom (Toby Kebell) had been critically thrashed, warranting a 5% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, after seeing this, part of me can see why, but on the other hand, on the other perspective, it's not exactly worthy of a low rating. The story splits into two segments: Reed Richards building the dimensional transporter and the four superheroes fighting Von Doom. Although the story takes itself way too seriously, most of the movie is shot in the dark, and the most of the action happens in the background, Josh Trank's Fantastic Four is competent on visual effects, the musical score by Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass, and the performances by Teller, Mara, Jordan and Bell. Most of the faults in the movie come from producer and co-writer Simon Kinberg, who wanted to capitalize on the success on The Avengers and X-Men and make a realistic version of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's story. His obsession with dimming the lights and desaturating every scene makes a chuck of the movie unwatchable and drab. On top of everything else, Trank tweeted that he wanted to be faithful to the source material except with a body count, resulting in a drastic tug of war game between him and Marvel. Despite the messy storyline and blatant studio intervention, Fantastic Four wasn't a good movie, but I'm glad I saw it. (2 ½ Black Hole Sky Portals out of 5)",Fantastic Four
309,gerumghl,A true 1 star,1,8 May 2018,"About no movie deserves a true 1 out of 10. If some things are good, it at least deserves a 2. But this, is a masterpiece of my garbage can I burned a billion years ago. Nothing is satisfying. It doesn't deliver an origin story or anything. No action I remembered. Actually, I don't really remember anything from this movie. This was just bland and didn't even have a clean fresh team up. It was so dark and blue, it was like it tried to make the most cliched but unoriginal hackeysack possible. The whole movie was pointless in anything. Most of the time weren't even what you'd want in an action movie. And it's not so bad, it's funny. It wasn't even trying bad. And the villain is another super cliched thing. He was a villain for no reason and just averagely cliched. It's impossible to possibly support this. One of 20 worst movies I've ever seen, possibly 10.",Fantastic Four
310,gtylerpayne,Should have been so much better,6,13 September 2015,"This movie really isn't that terrible, but considering the hyper, the budget, the resources, and the fact that Marvel has been putting out such great movies lately, it seems a lot worse than it is.First the good things... I actually thought the story was re-told in a pretty cool way at it's most basic form. The idea of traveling to another dimension, instead of out into space, I think could work very well. It leaves a lot of possibilities, but unfortunately most of these were not explored. The movie started off pretty well. In fact, for the first half of the movie, I thought maybe it was going to be a lot better than people let on.A lot of people on here are complaining about the cast, but I think they were okay, just poorly directed. Most of them have proved themselves to be good actors in other films. I heard Trank was telling them on set to be as flat as possibly with all their deliveries and it shows.I'm glad to hear that they are moving forward with FF2, because I don't think there is anything about this world that has been created that is inherently bad. The movie had lots of problems, but mostly that it felt incomplete, like it was cut short and scenes were missing along the way. This shouldn't really stop the next movie from being good.I heard stuff was cut from the movie, so I'm not really sure what the script looked like, if maybe things were cut afterward that make the story seem non-sensible, but the script as it is in the movie, is pretty bad. The characters aren't properly developed and it really seems like a bunch of random pages got deleted throughout the film, but they continued using it anyway.As far as the whole ""dark, gritty"" thing, I think it kind of works, but I'm not sure if this is the best superhero story for that. I feel like Fantastic Four is one of the more far-fetched superhero stories. I could buy the idea that they go to space (or another dimension) and come back with some sort of mutation. Chances are it would be negative of course, like some sort of cancer, but for the sake of entertainment, I could but the fact that cosmic radiation causes a beneficial mutation. But 5 completely different, random, and really cool mutations that are all completely different from one another?? Yeah right. If anything, they would all have the same or at least similar powers. That being said, this doesn't seem like the type of story that really needs to be taken super seriously. That's why I rather like the fact that Avengers and most of the other MCU movies have so much humor. Captain America and Iron Man have much more believable origin stories than Fantastic Four, so it seems silly to me to pick this one to make super serious, but had the plot holes been filled in and the movie been directed better, it could have worked.",Fantastic Four
311,Safcinexile,"Just because ""THEY"" have to make a FF movie, doesn't mean that they should!!!!",2,9 August 2015,"When are Fox going to learn just because they have to make a FF movie, does not mean that they should! They should accept the fact that they cannot make a decent FF movie and for sanity's sake let the movie rights revert back to Marvel, who what the fans want.I am not going to repeat what a lot has already been said on the previous reviews, because I cannot add any more than what has already been said.All I will say is that this version lacks any heart that it's predecessors had. Even the cast lacked any on screen chemistry, which is important for any FF movie. The film itself felt rushed and devoid of any humour that comic (which holds a firm place in my heart) has.I very much doubt Fox will learn from their mistakes and we will see another FF movie inflicted upon us in the next few years, but I sincerely hope they listen to the fans and do what is right.Now, if you excuse me, after going seeing that excuse of a movie, going to have a very hot and long shower, as I feel all nasty and violated (ARRGHGH!!!

313,Cpt_JackSparrow,Not as bad as all the reviews make it out to be,6,31 October 2015,"I just watched the movie being sure to keep an open mind and not let all the bad reviews cloud my judgement and I have to say, although not as action packed with an as good of a story line than many of the other Marvel movies that have been released so far, Fantastic Four certainly doesn't merit a 4.2 rating or such bad reviews that critics have given it.The acting was sub par at times and there were moments when the CGI looked like they ran out of their budget and so far I know I've only been negative but here is the positive part of it all. I was engrossed in the story, it was slow but as you can imagine, it is the case with almost all origin stories. This was not meant to be a one hit wonder. It was clearly meant to be a series of movies and this was just the start of it all. If given a chance, the sequel (which is highly doubtful now) could have possibly been much better. A good example of this would be the X-Men movies. I found the first X-Men Movie to be quite slow with very little character development and a slow plot with a few great effect here and there. The second X-Men movie (X2) however, absolutely blew me away.We are so quick to judge and dismiss but you can see that they were at least trying to entertain us and I for one although not overly entertained nevertheless was entertained and I'm the kind of person who can't keep his eyes on the screen if I find a movie boring withing the first 10 minutes.I did not go for it in the Cinema and I'm glad I didn't. If you waited to watch it on Blu-Ray than perhaps you may not be as disappointed as the others who watched it in the theatre.",Fantastic Four
314,racliff,Useless reboot wanting to be teenage drama,3,18 July 2021,"I'll start with ... if you haven't seen this movie, then don't.It's been six years since the release of reboot of a comic book story that I enjoyed a lot when I was young, and to be fair stopped reading many decades ago. I have no idea why Stan Lee would permit his name to appear with a project that missed the mark so badly.Reed Richards, with Ben Grimm, is found at a science fair, coincidentally have the answer for a project of Franklin Storm. And I almost turned off the movie at that point. Sadly when you destroy the backstory of all the characters, you waste the audience's energies on who the characters are. The stories I enjoyed were about adults: Reed completed multiple education degrees by the time he was 20; Susan meet Reed first when she was 17, and Johnny was here little brother. But they known each other a long time, and the Storm's father isn't project leader/hero either.This movie flops at every level, unless you like watching crappy teenage drama ... and that may well be the trend of recent years; nothing but young people and their world's being soooo dramatic.When I felt the accident in this story being from a world of different dimension, I was hopeful of some interesting science-fiction, but all I received was disappointment. In the end, I just wanted the movie to be over, and was grateful that It didn't cost me anything to watch it.",Fantastic Four
315,AlukardsCastle,One of the worst movies of any genre in the past 100 years.,1,7 August 2015,"I knew this movie was going to bomb from the moment I saw the teasers and all of the trailers. It just had this B movie vibe. Not the 'so bad its good' vibe either. But even so I still had this small glimmer of hope that it would be good. I went to see it. I was right. It was horrible. I think this is the last you'll see of the Fantastic Four in at least 20 years. The cinematography was amateurish throughout. This movie looked like a college project movie in the 90s that was an exercise in practicing new CGI elements. But don't think that I'm saying the CGI was good. It wasn't. Everything looked just awkward and bland. The Thing was entirely CGI in a bad way. I'm all for giving new actors chances to shine. But every single one of these actors and actresses not only bored me and the audience of the packed theater I was in, but truth be told, they all looked like forgettable faces. It was awkward throughout. The script seemed mixed up. The characters had no chemistry with each other and no appeal for the viewers. Also, the horrible casting of the 'token black guy' as the Human Torch was a huge step in the wrong direction. The actor playing him was just boring and his attempts at trying to seem like a tough guy made me roll my eyes. Again, the visuals were just ehhhh. I took my phone out halfway through the movie and began surfing the internet, something I absolutely loath to see people do during movies and have never done myself, until this movie. But I saw that at least 10 other people were doing similar things out of boredom from the movie. At least 20 people, including families with young kids walked out of the movie. I could have walked out but the fact that I paid to see the movie made me stay. It was the feeling of being in detention back in grade school. Its such a shame since the Fantastic Four is one of the more beloved comic book super heroes yet they've found it impossible to make a good movie adaptation of them. Maybe one day. This is one of the few movies were I agree 100% with the critics. This movie is bad. I'm just warning you. Its not good. At all. Go see Ant Man or Mission Impossible 5 instead.",Fantastic Four
316,commander_zero,Let These Kids Have Some Fun,5,9 February 2016,"In all the bad reviews I've read of this film, none of the writers has mentioned its defining moment of badness: when the young explorers get drunk and journey to the mystery planet/dimension, they celebrate their arrival by PLANTING AN American FLAG on its alien soil. Even Captain America would balk at this act of wanton imperialism (he balks at a lot of things his government wants him to do, which is one reason that the Captain America films are the best superhero films ever), but the planting of the flag marks a blindness to the implications of power that is one of this film's weaknesses; along with its incessant darkness. No one is having any fun, except in the expository chapters that bring young Reed and Ben together with the Storm family; these episodes are the best part of the film, except for their excessive length. Once the team gain their super-powers, Fantastic Four starts to pick up again, but then after a quickly staged battle on the mystery planet/dimension, it's all over. Do film makers always think a superhero film is going to be easy and then find, to their surprise, that it is not? The Tim Story films got it right with the cast and the mise en scene—an attractive mix of characters in the brightly-lit streets of New York City—but the writers could never figure out the tone; were the Four a joke, or not?--and the narrative device of pitting the Fantastic Four against Doctor Doom (although Trank and Toby Kebbell do much better with the Doom persona than the shrieky guy in the Story films) got old very fast. In the comics, the Four had a lot of gravitas: Reed Richards was dead serious about everything, constantly worried about putting his girlfriend/wife in danger, and burdened with guilt for making a monster out of his best friend; the Human Torch was always getting in over his head; the Thing was inclined to lose his temper, etc. They also got to pit their powers against a wide range of villains. In the movies, the Story films as well as Trank's, the Fantastic Four quite happily live in their dark laboratory until Doctor Doom comes along to be vanquished. Where are the legions of alien invaders and mad scientists who made the comics so much fun? Where are the Inhumans, not to mention the mole people, the Skrulls, Namor the Submariner lusting after Sue Storm, the other superheroes dropping by for a quickly-resolved dustup? Why does everything have to be dark and grimy? Let these kids have some fun.",Fantastic Four
317,psxp,boring and predicable,4,28 October 2015,"I read the reviews and watched this while I was doing some work. It was boring and was as good as a made for TV movie. I prefer the old Fantastic four movie from 2005 compared to this. And that wasn't *great* by any means, but at least it was entertaining.The beginning started off good but it just kinda got corny. Character depth is never worked on. It almost seemed a whole section of the middle of the film was missing. I mean, they never showed the abilities of the fantastic four other than in the final fight scene. It will be interesting to see what kind of sequel they will bring to follow this.

I understand in the world of superhero movies disbelief is seriously suspended, but to spend over half the movie with the most boring backstory imaginable (not clever, not funny , kid gets slapped around, teacher is an ass, at least have some justice prevails moments). The very second Miles Teller's pathetically weak face appears there is no doubt that the rest of this movie is going to continue to suck cause there is no way that face is going to save it. Oooh, how interesting , looking at books in the library and awards in the hallway. I think the test monkey was more into his role than any of the rest of them, and with the back story given who would care about them anyway? Source material is there for a reason and the wheel need not be reinvented to attract some imaginary movie going genre. Tell a good story with characters people care about, add some humor that isn't stupid or just plain wrong (waterboarding in 4th dimension?) Bad military guys or are those corporate suits we're supposed to not like, who the hell knows or cares. Here kids, just sit up to these chairs and test this high tech equipment, no safety or supervision required....yay, it worked first time, fist bump, uh grab (actually mildly funny moment) Does Sue like Reed now? Who knows, who cares? Oh, and let's not forget to throw in a ""it's clobberin' time "" just for nostalgia's sake. Time for Fox to get out of the Marvel business and in 10 years or so perhaps revisit this and do it right (like DC and WonderWoman, it can be done with the right script, director and cast)",Fantastic Four
319,zimmerblake,"Wait, that's it?",2,11 March 2018,"This movie may have confused me more than any movie ever has before. It's not awful, in the beginning. The introductions are informative but not overdone. Comedy is existent and has a good tone. It's not full of puns and crap like ""language!"" that you get in the MCU. Yet then the pace is about to pick up and...it doesn't. But wait, later in the movie the pace is setting itself up for liftoff and...the movie is over. It feels like the audience spends the entire movie waiting for the movie to start. This is disappointing because it had a lot of promise starting out and never lived up to it.",Fantastic Four
320,AngelFall1n,The Tragic Four,1,16 June 2021,"Well, looks like I'm late to the party. I wanted to like this movie but it was so boring, I just left it playing in the background. The storyline and characters were terribly dull and it was overly dramatic for no reason. All of them had horrible acting, nothing to hold on or relate to. I did not like the special effects and also how they were practically used as lab war rats. Also, Victor looked like a jealous whisperer. This disaster made me appreciate and cherish the 2005 Fantastic four a lot more.",Fantastic Four
321,cyer32,An equally pointless review,4,24 June 2021,"Im sure nobody needs my 2¢, but I just have a couple things to say.I gave this another shot (6/24/2021) now that my initial disappointment has finally subsided after watching this in 2015.1. What a waste of great actors. Glad MBJ made his way back to Marvel in a different role. Toby Kebbel is a phenomenal actor and could've made a good Doom...2. Dr. Doom's appearance...completely missed the aesthetic by every conceivable measure.That being said, I kinda liked Ben Grimm's look in this one.My brain hurts from trying to come up with positive things to say.If you need F4 fare, stick with the ones with Cap as Johnny Storm. Hopefully the new one will finally be the Fantastic take we all need.",Fantastic Four
322,taylorhammons,Where to begin??,1,8 August 2015,"when I saw how poorly this movie was ranking on IMDb I was not particularly interested. But I had promised to take my sister so I went. In the first 20 minutes, I was confused. It wasn't that bad. The actors were good and well cast, the characters were likable. And then it started. First, they begin throwing around things like alternate dimensions, a world much like outs but more primitive. Then it gets worse. The characters get powers from green veins of power in the rocks on an alternate planet?? Give me a break. That's weak even for superhero origin stories. And in the original marvel version, they got caught in a space storm. Then after getting their powers, every character lost his charm. Reed becomes extremely cowardly, Ben is just whiny, Sue is useless, and Johnny is just plain dumb. They skip over the best part of the original which is them finding out what they can do and how to use their powers and instead, the fantastic four spend a year in a government research facility training to be human weapons. The only redeeming quality is that, at least in this one the thing looks like he's actually made of rocks instead of plastic. I assure you it's not a fair trade. There is no backstory, no plot advancement. Just Ben being used as a human (or rock) war machine, Johnny begging to be exploited and sue flying around in a bubble. They barely even use their names and don't even call themselves the fantastic four until the very last minute. And then, to make matters worse, the movie's villain only shows up for the last 15 minutes and I have absolutely no idea what happened to him or even what his power is. He can blow up people's heads, move rocks, create black holes???? And I have no idea what they did to defeat it or how they managed it. This may be one of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen. And I survived daredevil AND X-2.",Fantastic Four
323,johnfbyers2010,Pretty Bad,3,20 May 2016,They get Sue Storm right this time but they butcher the entire story line of the original comic! The add in a half brother for Sue of a different race which clearly is not what Johnny Storm is supposed to be and you have the makings of a disaster. This movie loses everything because it is built on a different premise as the comic. The first or should I be correct and say second attempt with Ione Gruffad was much better and except for Jessica Alba made sense. This movie doesn't have much entertainment value holding it and only what happens to the major characters. I do like the performance of the actor playing Reed Richards and is probably the only reason this film is watchable. I also like the actor playing Ben but that us about it so don;t waster your time watching this.,Fantastic Four
324,plantsvszombiestim,Not Worth it,2,3 May 2019,"Went to watch this expecting it to be pretty good even though my expectations were pretty low to begin with. Even then the movie was a disappointment and definitely came out feeling like there should've been more. Didn't really relate to the characters, too much backstory on two characters and little plot at all. At the end I was like ""is that all?"" and ""that's it?"" The ending was set up really badly and the ending was rushed. Hard to find much good in this one, maybe the fact that their was at least some action.",Fantastic Four
325,DavidTL,a NEW atmosphere.,7,4 August 2015,"Fantastic Four. A more gritty realistic reboot. The film has a fresh new atmosphere to it, almost as fresh as Batman: The Dark Knight did. But I would not compare story and characters to that. Just how it doesn't feel like a typical superhero film.Director Josh Trank successfully builds a new atmosphere and feel for a superhero film. You instantly know the characters, and feel compelled in their journey to success. This is much more of a science fiction thriller than a superhero film though. Do not go in expecting the typical multiple fight scenes, as this film keeps its pace and does not feel rushed. That is, except for the climax of the film, which at a point you suddenly realise this is the climax, and you are near the end. There is a lot of great build up, but ends rather suddenly. But once you get to the point where you realise it is the climax, you will accept it, as it is still thrilling.The movie actually deals with their powers as almost disabilities, disfigurements. They don't achieve their powers and then are like ""oh woo, I'm going to help people and stop the bad guy"". They are actually scared of their 'powers' to start with, and it is disturbing. You feel it too as you watch it, and that is great. I haven't seen a superhero before which successfully pulled this off. The characters confused at their new abilities. I hope Marvel don't one day buy the rights back and reboot it for their Marvel Cinematic Universe. If anything, I'd love for them to continue this franchise, but let it be in an alternate world which Reed could cross over into the MCU. Bring it together. As then they would have more possibilities for the different alternate versions of characters, giving the studio more advantages of changes.",Fantastic Four

The Film starts slow.. too slow... The action, characters, acting, and directing is very sub par. This entire film does not make much sense. The first two films were decent to sub decent. But this ""reboot"" (as if we need to know how they become ""super heroes"") is just boring. Not worth seeing, or even renting. This film should have been titled by another name .. like ""Fantastic X men"", even though, one character is female. We will not be carrying this film on our Film Libraries (with good, or ""bad"" reasons)..",Fantastic Four

329,kevinthecritic,"Marvel's New Film Not Fantastic, But It's No Failure",3,7 June 2018,"Note: My thoughts on this film have changed dramatically since this review. Today, I completely agree with the majority opinion: the characters are weak, the tone is overly dour, and the film completely lacks a second act due to studio meddling. Today, my score would probably be 1.5 out of 5 (one of the worst of the year). I don't know what possessed me to give this a decent review in 2015, but please enjoy my faint praise below:2.5 out of 5 stars (decent)Marvel's newest, non-Avengers offering: Fantastic Four is not what you think it is. The marketing for this made it look overly dark and contemplative for a film of its type, leading me to believe it would be a serious character study that would bore me to sleep. The reviews thus far have said that this movie is dull, overly dark, and anticlimactic. I wholly disagree. Though it is noticeably flawed, Fantastic Four is a fun, decently entertaining sci-fi action film with some good humor and likable characters.Reed Richards (Miles Teller of the Divergent series and Whiplash) is a misunderstood genius who has been building a machine that would allow interdimensional travel with his best friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell of 2005's King Kong) since the 5th grade. Now a senior in high school, Reed displays his machine for a science fair, only to have his teacher to laugh it off.Reeds' luck changes when he is given the opportunity by scientist Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey of The Wire) to get his machine up and running. Reed will work with Franklin's children, hothead Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), his adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara), and Frank's old colleague Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) to achieve this. The quartet eventually makes their dreams come true, but that comes at a price that none of them could have ever seen coming.I understand that my plot description seems a bit rote, but I cannot tell you anymore of the story without spoiling it. I can assure you it is worth it.The cast is fine in their respected roles. Miles Teller and Kate Mara are believable as nerds, and Toby Kebbell does fine with what he is given. Michael B. Jordan provides good comic relief, but he isn't very interesting. Jamie Bell gets the short end of the stick, as he doesn't have enough to do in the film, and disappears for some of the first act, only appearing when the plot needs him to. Because of this, I didn't have a strong connection with the character, something that the last set of films (yes, this is a reboot) nailed.Action-wise, it's good when it's there. There's one action sequence at the beginning, a very short one in the middle, and one at the end. They are intense, well-shot, and don't go on too long (In fact, I wouldn't have minded if the climax was a bit longer, but it's good as is). Josh Trank (who co-wrote the script) confidently directs the action, but he could improve in directing his actors.In my review of Ant Man, I mentioned the good chemistry between the actors. Fantastic Four is the exact opposite. The actors don't have consistent chemistry with each other, making many of the scenes awkward to watch. I understand that Reed and Sue aren't going to be like Buffy and Willow right away, but Reed's chemistry with Ben is so bad that it's nearly laughable. On the bright side, Franklin and Johnny work passably off of each other, but only passably. This is not the script's fault (though it is far from a perfect gem), it's the fault of Josh Trank. This is only his second film, and I feel it was a mistake to give a big project like this to someone who isn't experienced enough to handle the pressures of it.My final complaint is the amount of profanity in the movie. I normally have no issue with it, but Marvel doesn't have a lot of bad language in their movies, and this one had much more than I expected. I have seen lots of kids in Marvel theaters throughout the years, and this movie alienates that audience segment by inserting the profanity. Kids beg for the merchandise for these movies, so putting in profanity only prevents them from being able to see it. Those kids might be a saving grace for the movie, given its current projected box office returns.Fantastic Four is not Marvel's best by any means, but it certainly not its worst either. The individual actors are good and the humor is appropriately placed. When present, the action sequences are intense and decently exciting, and the script is mostly sound (despite a few over-the-top lines and catchphrases at the end, but they are forgivable.) See Fantastic Four at the $2.00 Theater, and you should be decently entertained.Rated PG-13 for Sci-Fi Action Violence and Language",Fantastic Four
330,jhalcollege,There's really only one problem,4,4 November 2018,"Here's an analogy:A student has to do a presentation on World War II. He gathers a ton a good information on the causes of the war, and the events leading up to it. World War I, mistreatment of Germany, invasion of Poland, he's got it all. Then, he puts even more effort into the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
Unfortunately, he realizes that his report is due tomorrow, and he slaps together the Normandy Invasion, Battle of Midway, Island Hopping, and the Atomic Bomb all in a single day. The Battle of the Bulge doesn't even get a mention.This is precisely the issue with Fantastic Four. It honestly does a solid job of introducing the setting, the characters, and the conflict. But it takes 70 minutes to do this, and then 30 minutes later you're sitting on the couch wondering what exactly just happened.",Fantastic Four

Maybe it was 18 minutes.In another 10 years -- when they try to make a Fantastic Four movie again -- maybe they should just start with The Four already with their powers and allude to origins, teasing us to want another movie. Can't be any worse than the this and the other attempt that also got a bit hung up on origins, although not as much as this one.In this one they allude to Doom's past, and that's enough. So why not just allude to the origin for all of them?

How they come up to that kind of story?I was really not excited about this new Fantastic Four movie when they announce the cast. People keep insulting it but I still have my faith on it because there are rumours that there will be an x-men and Fantastic Four crossover. So it happened. I watched it and I was really shocked. It's really boring, it has Lots of conversation and the fighting scenes were bad! Epic Bad! The story focuses on Reed who dreams to make a teleportation device. Franklin Storm, saw his potential and took him as a student. He met Sue, Johnny and Victor in Baxter Foundation. Ben Grimm is his best friend since they were kids. Accident occurs in the other dimension where they got their powers. Victor wants to stay in the otherworld while planning to destroy the earth. The fantastic Four stops him, end of the movie.See how quick that was? And nonsense it was?I rate it 50%. Seriously. The effects were good, it's just the story and the fighting scenes were worst!

Josh Trank messed up with Marvel's first heroes from the moments he touched them. An horrible cast, horrible plot and horrible CGI screw up what were once incredible characters. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING of the Fantastic Four and the whole movie is a useless bunch of scenes ripoff from Insugernt, Ender's Game, Halo and (surprise) Chronicle. These are not the Fantastic Four we know and love and it's not even a good movie perse. Give the rights back to Marvel if you're not interest in making a proper movie. Like Constantine, Elektra, Batman & Robin, Dragon Ball Evolution and many other messed-up, this movie shows off once again that you can't just screw up the original source like you are better than them. If you're not interest in Fantastic Four neither you know them at all then don't make a Fantastic Four movie in the first place.

336,steefan-92,Most underrated movie of the year so far ....,7,12 September 2015,"I didn't watch movie immediately because of ratings it got and well reception of comic readers, given that I am comic reader too.So, imagine my surprise when I actually liked this reboot much more than I expected.Whole point of reboot is starting a new, fresh, loosing tides with old ways and this movie does exactly that. I am not sure how I feel about breaking well established cliché that Sue and Joe are twins and fact that Human Torch is black man but it worked well in the movie, personal problems with aside.This is the best movie for FF4 up to date, let's not kid ourselves, that previous movies are better.They league away from it, in fact they are plain terrible.This movie is superior to previous movie both in acting and plot, it takes the best from comics and it's own script and turns it into very decent movie.Now negative feedback comes mostly from, unsatisfied comic fans, who are mad that movie doesn't follow comic lore to the letter.Well let me tell you little secret, FF in MU (marvel universe) is second rate group of heroes, they were never main cannon and in fact those comic series had very few memorable issues/ arcs.Further on subject FF received so many comic reboots and it never lasted long, so to fans of series, I have to say this, chill for the love of god and stop acting unreasonably.Film has issues, it's not error free.First it tries to be a bit more than it should for a new entry or fresh reboot.It can get a bit tedious at some parts and there wasn't much room for character development, still there were some memorable moments.My verdict is that this movie did great job into breathing fresh life to already mediocre heroes and it opened new opportunities.Comic fans will mostly hate it,some like me will love it but don't let their clouded judgment decide for you, while new comers who never read comics or heard about FF4 before will like it.",Fantastic Four
337,Skaigear,"A lazy, putrid excuse disguising itself as a motion picture – this was cinema at its pessimal.",3,10 August 2015,"When the initial reviews of Fantastic Four dropped, so did my jaw. A whopping 17% was what it started out with on Rotten Tomatoes. Now granted I was never excited by the film in the first place, and the trailers really didn't allow me to have much faith. Nevertheless, a seventeen percent was still a catastrophic peculiarity too hard to ignore. If the behind the scene subplot of the whole Marvel-Fox rights shenanigans didn't make me wish Fantastic Four completely fall on its face, the rumor of the detestable, extraordinary douche-bag nature of director Josh Trank during the production certainly did. Regardless of my own bias though, I was willing to walk into the theater completely open-minded to give this movie a real chance. I mean, it can't possibly be that bad, right? Wrong it can.When the last awkward scene ended and the credits began I was left dumbfounded in the theater as few of the audience member decided to inexplicably applaud. A lazy, putrid excuse disguising itself as a motion picture – this was cinema at its pessimal, aimed towards the lowest common denominator of movie goers. There's very little good thing as to say about the movie... actually... there's very little to say period. NOTHING. HAPPENS.The only thing that was scantily serviceable though was the sci-fi horror tone. Not being a big Fantastic Four fan of any medium, I wasn't as upset at the change of tone as others were. I really didn't mind the big departure from the more fun, bright and colorful tone of the comic books in favor of a more dark and gritty and horror atmosphere. While superhero horror movies has existed in forms of the Blade and Ghost Rider series, the genre crossing borders with a property such as Fantastic Four does peak certain curiosities. Not saying it necessarily worked, because nothing worked in this movie, but it was at the very least an admirable attempt.There is no ""plot"", but unfortunately there's not much in form of ""characters"" to be found either. Sure there are human beings in the movie in the flesh, they speak and breathe, but are also soulless and hollow as a pipe. The fact these are a bunch of 28 to 30-something-year-olds playing 18 makes the whole bad movie experience even more abominable. You heard that right. They're not young looking 30-somethings either, which immediately took me out of the movie just by how distracting that is.Miles Teller who plays the lead character Reed Richards, is dry and boring and looks uninterested. With reports of him and director Trank coming to set high and drunk on multiple occasions, I can understand why work would seem uninteresting in comparison. His character has zero motivation to do what he does. I for the life of me couldn't figure out the reason he wanted to build the Quantum Gate, he just does, because script. When the main character of your movie has zero motivation the rest of the movie tends to crumble. Is it so hard to create a reason for why a character strive in a narrative? I'm not even asking for all supporting characters to have motives or anything, but the lead whom is suppose to lead the story? WHAT IS THE POINT of the movie if even the lead is not trying to accomplish anything in particular? Why is he even there and why are scenes even happening? They just... do. There is no three act structure as found in real movies, only random scenes sewn together in a barely coherent way.The rest of cast seem to be phoning it in as well. Monotonous line delivery and standard acting galore from everyone involved. With a group of superheroes that are supposedly family, these people seem to be less than strangers. With the nearly 50-minutes required for the movie to give our heroes their powers, there should've been ample time for character development, but there is incomprehensibly none of it. While the screenplay written by director Trank along with Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater was aimed to be ""dark"" and ""gritty"", the dialogues sure seem more in line with the cheesiness of children's cartoons than the earnestness of The Dark Knight.Because of the randomness of events just happening, the pacing is all over the place. 90 minutes long, the movie is all buildup till the 45-minute mark when the team members finally get their powers, don't start using it until 60-minute mark, Doom doesn't show up until 75-minutes, and... it's over at 90 minutes. Just when you thought the movie can finally get started, it just abruptly ends after one of the worst-shot big-budget climatic battle ever witnessed on celluloid. The final scene with the team acting like a ""family"" when half of them never even had a moment with one another was cringe-worthy enough even if it wasn't accompanied by an obligatory ""team naming"" scene that was nothing short of an abysmal embarrassment for everybody involved.Say whatever you want about bad superhero movies like Batman & Robin, but at least they know they're bad and we can watch them and laugh at it and be entertained; Fantastic Four actually takes itself seriously. I have a rule, if you want to be a movie that's serious and devoid of humor, then you just HAVE TO BE good. If we can't laugh, you can't bore us to tears and be horrible at the same time. Unfortunately, that is exactly what Fantastic Four achieved. Please go see this so you can experience what watching an awful big-budget collage of moving images feels like, but don't pay for it because giving Fox your money will just accidentally encourage a sequel that nobody wants. If a film like Ant-Man is cheesecake – sweet, enjoyable and full of flavor, then Fantastic Four is cardboard – sterile, rough and indigestible.",Fantastic Four
338,kingslandbungalow,Nausea! Heartburn! Indigestion! Upset Stomach! Diarrhea!,1,25 August 2015,"All of these stomach ailments are things I would rather suffer than see this movie again... Where to begin? Absolutely terrible casting to start with - some weird back-story with Reed and Ben being in the same class in elementary school and then flash forward to ""now"" - with older Reed being in a high school science fair(?!) when Sue and Victor are working in a ""grown up"" science facility! And the way the Ben character chews his gum with his mouth open - so super gross - maybe it was to make him appear tough? Anyhow - the money spent on this film is nowhere to be seen - not in the story, effects, or acting. The story is very slow as well - it takes more than half the movie to get to the actual ""creation"" of the FF. The characters have no rapport with each other and seem VERY miscast. Reed is a cross between Peter Parker and Frodo, Ben is a cross between a rock with Down syndrome and a plank of wood (I have never seen a less expressive actor) and Sue (the usually tolerable Kate Mara) is here not as a character but as something for Victor and Reed to squabble over. Victor is brooding, brooding and brooding - and only shows up as the villain in last ten minutes. The climactic action sequence is thrown in just because there HAS to be a climactic action sequence - it actually pits the FF as a whole against Reed! I can't imagine a worse movie if I tried - easily the worst of 2015 to date. When you consider the money spent on this it's laughable. AVOID!",Fantastic Four
339,botev1921,This is one of the dumbest reboots!,1,8 August 2015,"Not that the previous attempt to bring Fantastic 4 to the big screen was spectacular but this one is by far ten times worse for a variety of reasons. First of all, it has very little to do with the comics, the animated series or anything remotely related to Fantastic 4's success from the past. The cast is atrocious and not because they aren't good actors but because they are totally unsuitable to play those characters. This equals an attempt to make Batman into a teenager and I am sure even that would work better. Lastly, those reboots of something that did not work too well before seem a real desperation move by whoever was stupid enough to invest in them. Give it a few years or just go the Batman way of darkness.",Fantastic Four
340,Challenger2013,Not Sure if They Even Tried,2,16 August 2015,"I never liked the the 2005 version of ""Fantastic Four."" I've always considered it a disappointing superhero film. Amazingly, I found myself actually longing for it when I saw the new, rebooted version. Yes, this film is so bad that it almost makes the original seem like a good film. It's the type of movie that just gets worse and worse and drags on more and more with each passing second. The picture introduces us to Reed Richards (Miles Teller), a young boy-genius who builds a small teleportation machine in his parents' garage (Might I add that the film already lost me at this point; seriously, a twelve-year-old builds a TELEPORTATION MACHINE.) After befriending Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) at the junkyard, the two enter an updated machine at the high school science fair seven years down the road. It is here that Reed is noticed by Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara), who offer him a scholarship at an institute attempting to create a device that can teleport human life to another dimension. Storm's son Johnny (Michael B. Jordan) and former colleague Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) get forced into the plot and help build the machine. On a drunken night, Reed, Johnny, Victor, and Ben (who randomly gets invited by Reed) decide to up and travel to a planet in another dimension, breaking every rule in the book. Bad things happen, Doom gets left behind, and the others have outstanding abilities when they return. Oh, and Sue gets powers too, but instead of just having her travel with the guys, the screenwriters decided to leave her behind and give her powers when the teleportation machine explodes for some reason...don't ask why. A year passes with our heroes held in a maximum security location, and then all of a sudden they're battling Victor (now Dr. Doom presumably) who wants to take over the world without any given motive. Yep, that's pretty much it...Director Josh Trank claims that Fox Studios took control of the film from his hands, then took his great product and turned it into this piece of trash. Whether this is true or not is debatable, but it's pretty evident that he didn't have control of this picture. The story is nearly unwatchable when put on screen. Nothing exciting, interesting, or intriguing happens for most of the film, then everything happens at once in the last fifteen minutes. Even worse, what does finally happen is nowhere near worth the wait and falls short of anything that can be described as ""epic"" or ""fun."" The terrible script does not offer much to the actors, but it's not like they make the most of what they are given. Teller tries much too hard to fit into his character and fix something that just cannot be fixed. Mara and Bell seem like they do not really care at all most of the time. Jordan and Kebbell are really the only ones who ""almost"" make the most of what they are given, but it's not enough to save the picture. The sad truth is that these characters, like the story, are ill-conceived and undeveloped. The filmmakers completely wasted would-be-great characters like The Thing and Dr. Doom (who is only on screen for those last, awful fifteen minutes.) It's not enough to make the scenes between the Fantastic Four extremely corny (especially during an absolutely unwatchable scene where they attempt to come up with a name); it also gives them no time to develop into a team. These people are barely likable and still seem like strangers when they are finally called into action. The cinematography was the one aspect of the film that was done right in the first hour. Then, when the need for strong special effects came, the film seemed almost as cartoonish as ""The Green Lantern."" In this day and age, where great special effects rule cinema, audiences should not be subjected to the simple, effortless effects seen here. ""Fantastic Four"" might have been watchable if it seemed as though those involved actually tried to create an acceptable product. When watching this film, I wondered if the filmmakers even watched the final picture. Then I wondered if they had any idea what they were doing while making the film, because it seems as though they just threw it together like a crappy collage. Apparently, there is already a sequel in the works. It may be a terrible idea, but at least Fox has put the sequel in a situation where it can't possibly be worse than the first installment. Then again, I never say never. Perhaps it's best for the Fantastic Four to pack their bags and follow Spider-Man over to Marvel Studios.",Fantastic Four
341,hennyxu,"Fantastically underrated, worth watching.",6,31 October 2015,"To many people this movie is known as the big BOM of 2015 with ratings falling below the 1 (Rottentomatoes). This movie is even considered worse than Batman and Robin directed by Joel Schumacher. So is this negativity towards this movie justified? Well before I dive deeper within this conundrum I need to state that this is my own opinion, however for this movie I really hope you agree with me at least a little. Let us begin with a little history lesson. Superhero movies have grown exponentially in the last couple of decades starting with the x-men (or Blade). During this period the superhero genre has evolved from parodies to a movie genre with deep character development, storytelling, and a good balance between action and drama. Also we can't ignore the power house that is Marvel with their line of interconnected movies. However, for every x-men movie there is an x-men 3 or for the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy there is Dark Knight Rises (Am I wrong?!!). So am I saying that this movie belongs in the bad category (e.g., Batman & Robin, Catwoman, Daredevil) NO I am NOT!!! Let me be honest here, YES I was one of the haters out there who believed that this movie would be bad. However, after watching it I was surprisingly and Fantastically entertained. Before I continue about this issue, why this movie has failed at the box office, I would like to talk about the movie first. Some of you may have seen a previous version made in 2005 and 2007 they were corny but fun popcorn flicks. So fast forward a couple of years after the Batman trilogy by Nolan and the Marvel effect and we have a complete movie remake: FANTASTIC FOUR 2015. The story starts with a couple of kids named Reed Richards (Wizkid) and Ben Grimm (Muscle) becoming friends and trying to build their own teleporter. This hobby and relationship grows into their teens and during a science fair their project was discovered by Dr. Storm; who invites Reed to join his project to complete a dimensional gate/teleporter. During this time we get to know Johnny storm (Cool Guy), adopted sister Sue Storm (The Girl) and Victor Von Doom (Bad Guy). Eventually they succeed in building the machine and they teleport to an alien planet that contained some kind of unstable energy. This energy changed them before they could teleport back and from that moment on they have SUPER POWERS. The character development starts strong (for some) but after the first act it feels like though the script lost focus. There was no character fleshed out completely and some characters didn't even get any development. The music was average to say the least with no memorable score (however many movies these days are guilty of this SIN). The atmosphere within this movie is constant with a feel towards the serious like the batman trilogy. The story flow is the biggest problem with this movie, because after they have gained their powers they decided to skip one year. It would have been better to use this time to develop and enrich the characters within this movie. Based on the three act structure I would say that the movie has a strong beginning, okay middle, and an enjoyable but not perfect ending. The movie is about 90 minutes long, which is much shorter than an average superhero movie these days. However, this isn't a bad thing. Within this time span the director Josh Trank was able to make a movie that checked almost everything on the list, please note MOVIE. When comparing this with similar movies within its genre it becomes clear that this isn't a real Superhero movie. Yes people have powers and there is a bad guy, however for a superhero movie there isn't any superhero moment or feel. That is why I think this movie BOMBED at the box office. This movie IS NOT A SUPERHERO MOVIE. With the growing amount of superhero movies these days people have created expectations of what a superhero movie should be, based on movies like batman or marvel. When a movie like Fantastic Four shows up that is not similar to any other superhero film people are happily to start saying that it is bad, which is very harsh and unfair. While this movie isn't as good as a typical marvel movie or other hero film it is very enjoyable. This movie contains many scientific explanations and technical constructions etc. etc. so in essence it is a SCIFI film. So what am I saying? Fantastic Four is an enjoyable movie that does not deserve the harsh backlash that it got. People should accept the movie for what it is and not what it could have been or what they wanted it to be. When you watch it please watch it expecting it to be an average SCIFI film and I promise you it will not disappoint. This movie was truly Fantastic. I give this movie a 6.5",Fantastic Four

343,jogre17,"""Fantastic?"" not really... But it is pretty good!",8,8 November 2015,"I remember when the 2005 adaptation of the Fantastic 4 came out. It never seemed all that amazing to me at the time, so I didn't even ever think about watching it, at least until Silver Surfer came out. I watched both of them but I wasn't really all that impressed. Jessica Alba though was pretty hot though.When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought immediately, ""Oh, okay. A reboot. I hope it's good."" I was pretty excited, especially since the media was making a pretty big deal about it prior to it's release this past summer. It wasn't until after it's release that I wasn't as excited, but still curious. It took me a while to actually see the movie and come up with my own opinion.Well, I've seen the movie and all I can say is I love the characters. They really chose a wonderful cast. Doom was perfect and I loved how they made his character out to be a bit of a bad attitude a-hole off the bat. I just wish they showed more character development of him becoming Dr. Doom himself beyond the portal.Reed Richards, Mr. Fantastic, was casted very well. Miles Teller is a magnificent actor and I hope to see more of him in other movies soon, but he really embraced himself as a young Reed. It was almost as if he was made for the part.Susan Storm, The Invisible Woman, was good as well. Kate Mara fit the part pretty well, she just didn't have too much dialogue and they could have done a lot more with her than they did with her and her brother Johnny.Johnny Storm, Human Torch, was amazing! Michael B Torch did a wonderful playing the role of this headstrong character. Honestly, I would have never even thought of him as The Human Torch, but he really does pull it off.Ben Grimm, Thing, was pretty good. He didn't come across a the right guy at first, but as you watch the movie, you see that he does a good job. Also, I love the way Thing actually looks, when compared to the other version of Thing.The characters were by far the best part. The story could have been better, but it's not bad at all for being an origin story. I hate movies that are meant to be origin movies, and yet jump right into the character right away. The 2005 adaptation did that and I din't like that at all. Same goes with Spiderman. The first one, not the ""Amazing"" series with Garfield. This movie had a pretty good pace to it for being an origin story and had it's potential, but I guess it was too dark for most people to handle. Plus critics and most people are very stubborn and are always dying for action and CGI. Well, guess what. You get some, but you can't just go into a movie and say it's crap because it lacks a lot of action packed scenes. People really need to grow up and understand what actually makes movies good.8 out 10 stars for me. Please, actually consider this review and give the movie a chance. Everyone is subject to their own opinion. Go get your own.",Fantastic Four
344,johngraham1964,Awful...,1,10 September 2015,"I know you can re-imagine origin stories for superheroes but, to be honest, in this case - leave well enough alone.On top of that, this film doesn't come that much later than the original Marvel FF4 origin film. The origin there was tweaked from the original in the comic books (but at least it was in space.....) Putting that aside - why reboot so soon? Plenty of films carry on the narrative and re-cast. I know that FF4 The Silver Surfer didn't go down too well (especially with the character of Galactus) but this film takes it to new lows.I read that the director produced a very different film which the studio demanded major re-shoots to. Maybe we will never see a director's cut but this studio cut is boring. Dull. Tedious. Unimaginative. But let's not lay all the blame at the studio's door.Script? Awful. Slow. Lacking in action. Lacking in character development. Lacking in generation of sympathy for any of the characters.Casting? It may have been a creative decision to make the lead characters almost children (though, as has been pointed out elsewhere, their screen ages and the ages of some of the actual cast are miles apart) but that decision gives them no gravitas. And Johnny Storm isn't black. Except in this film. Very strange. I am all for more black characters in Marvel films - great to see War Machine and The Falcon given more screen time - and more to come in the next Avengers film, along with The Black Panther. Can I put in a word for Black Goliath as well? But I still fail to understand why a white character in the comics becomes black in the films... first Nick Fury and now The Human Torch. Actually I felt most of the film was miscast.The Thing - they did him with CGI and so he doesn't look real - like the Hulk. You can so tell it's CGI.Someone said to me: well that's 1 1/2 hours of your life you'll never get back - and he was so right. If the studio has any sense it will sell the DVD/Blu ray to people (if it can) and not make a sequel.",Fantastic Four
345,veensepeper,Fant4stic build-up; no pay off,4,10 August 2015,"Although I went in with low expectation, this new version of Fantastic Four turned out to be a promising movie from beginning to end. Promising, but not delivering, unfortunately. It felt like this movie did not come out of its first act, until the 'big epic fight' that lacked... everything a big epic fight should have. Never before, not even in The Incredible Hulk, did the final fight feel as slapped on and detached from everything else as it did in this movie.Another problem was, that this was not really an FF movie. The Fantastic Four are called the 'first family' of superheroes. A decent FF movie would portray Reed as the father figure, Sue as motherly, Johnny as a child and Ben as a beloved uncle. Instead of the Fantastic Four, we got 'A Bunch Of Teens, Getting Powers That Are Kinda Like Those Of The Fantastic Four'. It also didn't help that the four of them barely worked as a team. I must admit that the way THESE characters behaved, teenagers were the way to go. But if you actually want to make a Fantastic Four movie, Reed should be played by someone from the likes of Peter Galagher or Patrick Dempsey.Then, there is the bad guy... If the script knew what it was doing, they would have left Doom dead in the other dimension (and get him back not before the sequel). Have Tim Blake Nelson's character be the bad guy. Build-up wise, it would make sense, and it would make the ending feel not so detached. Instead, Doom returns from this cosmic accident, like ten minutes before the end of the movie. Apparently, he went to the Ultron-school of 'Hey, I'm the bad guy for some reason', as he tries to kill his former teammates and destroy the world (of course!). I don't consider mentioning this as a spoiler, since it has barely anything to do with the plot - which was more of a long winded study on how the characters come to turn with their powers.A final battle doesn't need to have the world at stake. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man's final battles were mainly about rescueing Mary Jane. The final battle in the first X-Movie revolved around a mutant making machine in the Statue of Liberty's giftshop. Nonetheless, since they build up to that point properly, the audience was involved in the action and stakes. Lesson learned: it's not the biggest stakes that makes for a good finale, it's the best build-up that does. Fant4Stic does build up to something, but NOT to its finale. The something that it actually builds up to, however, never comes...All in all, the movie keeps you entertained or at least interested during its running time, but it leaves you unfulfilled after it.The definitive Fantastic Four movie is yet to be made...",Fantastic Four
346,thependragonscribe,"""Fant4stic"" is The Most Hollow Hollywood Can Offer",1,9 August 2015,"Before I get to the ""predictable"" review, I'll admit this: I was excited for this movie. The trailers are mind-blowing. The cast is composed of great actors. The director of Chronicle is taking the helm. The new take of Marvel's first superhero team is intriguing. With all that said, I can firmly say how much I am betrayed by Fant4stic.The plot is not only nonsensical, but empty. The first act, starting with Reed Richards' childhood, builds up weakly but effectively. Then it strays lazily to the rest of the running time, with nothing gained but frustration. As an origin story, it not only goes by-the-numbers, but clutters plot elements with no pay off. How does it work? As every movie critics' pet peeve, exposition. Director Josh Trank tries his best to squeeze in every familiar plot beat to 100 minutes, but exposing every story detail gets no redemption. As a result, nothing is exciting. Being loyal to the Stan Lee-Jack Kirby comics is beyond my knowledge, but this movie never feels any semblance of a Fantastic Four story.Not helping is the fact that the movie feels rushed, throwing character development and conflict out of the window (important story elements by the way). Speaking of characters, none will actually impact, but frustrate, courtesy of the wonky script and wooden dialogue that was given to them.Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic is the clichéd determined genius with Murphy's Law in his application. Miles Teller tries his best in the role, only to end up bland and one-dimensional. The Storm Siblings, Johnny Storm/The Human Torch and Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, barely shows any discernible trait. And that says a lot given their unorthodox casting. There could be more material for Michael B. Jordan and Kate Mara to work on, like Sue being adopted to a family of color, but nothing came out of them. It does not help that Reg E. Cathey's Franklin Storm is the blandest of father figures I ever seen. Tim Blake Nelson is wasted as a stock government official guy. And Toby Kebbell's Victor von Doom is the most unforgivable character of the movie. His Victor personality, being a nihilistic computer programmer, is nothing new. And his Doctor Doom alter ego has the most unconvincing villain look, turning his serious look into a laughable presence, making Power Rangers baddies look intimidating. The only character that I root for is Jamie Bell's Ben Grimm who transforms into The Thing. But his performance cannot save this dreary experience. From that, the team dynamic that the Fantastic Four is known for is never apparent or recognized. They are just awkward, wearisome characters, with no superhero antics lathered.What can I say about the others? The CGI is the most horrendous of this year. It looks that it had been dated from the year when the Tim Story Fantastic Four came out. There are obvious green screen scenes in the proceedings. Mr. Fantastic's stretch effects are atrocious. And the climax is where the sole action set piece of the movie kicks in, with no buildup, no progress and no excitement. All of these attributes to one of the frustrating movies I have watched in a cinema.Say what you will about the 2005 film and its erratic sequel, movies I hate by the way. At least they stayed to the spirit of the team dynamics of the comics. 2015's Fantastic Four never establishes anything other than a studio-mandated update that never gains anything but disappointment. Fant4stic is indeed not only one of the worst superhero movies ever, but also one of the most disappointing movies of all time. It indeed gets the ""dishonor"" as the worst movie of 2015, dethroning Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. This is no recommendation to witness an atrocity, but a warning to behold the most hollow that Hollywood can offer.",Fantastic Four
347,jmichael3387,An absolute snooze-fest.,2,16 August 2015,"At least I got one laugh....looking at my girlfriend an hour into this movie as she was dozing-off. And she's the one who wanted to see this movie. Neither of us could believe that a superhero movie could be so boring. For the first hour, absolutely nothing happened. Most of the time was spent in a dark laboratory. No action, no good dialog, no good characters, nothing.As you know, the characters are NOTHING even remotely resembling the original Fantastic Four. They are all 18-years-old. To get by this huge plot-hole, they say that Reed Richards is a boy-genius. They say he invented an inter-dimensional-traveling rocket when he was in the 5th grade. Stupid, right? Johnny Storm (we all know he's black now) is on the team because he street-races cars and can ""fix anything"". Ben Grimm is Reed's short skinny nerdy friend from 5th grade. Dr. Doom (who shows-up in the last 15 minutes) is a lovesick computer-nerd. Not an iron-fisted ruler of a nation; a lovesick computer-nerd. Geez, no pandering to the audience here!Nothing is explained as to how anyone got their powers. They just went to a planet with green ooze on it, and now they're powered. There's no action, no using of the powers, until the last 15 minutes. Dr. Doom (super-powered) shows up, they fight, and the movie ends. That's it. No explanation for anything. They didn't even explore this planet. They're just in the same spot all the time, and there's nothing there. Very boring.Oh, I guess they did explain why a team so young went on the mission. Because they got drunk and just decided to go. No one else was ever in the building.I was generous and gave it 2 stars.

349,sean73267326,Oh dear...,4,21 August 2015,"I think it's a long time since I actually felt SORRY for a film. A very long time. I think it may have been Catwoman, back in 2004, another movie that meant extremely well (and god knows it was trying) but fell flat on its feline face. Well, it happened again, with Fantastic Four, but the sad thing is, it's not for the same reasons - it actually has (had) potential.Somewhere deep inside 2015's reboot of Fantastic Four is the bones of a very good movie that just hasn't been finished the right way, and that's why I almost feel sorry for it. The cast is up there with The Avengers in terms of acting ability, but it strands every single character in a sea of one-dimensional dialogue. It has a plot that's great - but only once it's explained, because the movie itself keeps it so vague at times that there's no real incentive to really care what happens. When it works, it has some fantastic visual ideas - but the CGI job looks average at best, and at worst it looks like it may have been done by work experience students.By far the biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. In the summer where Mad Max: Fury Road came out, this movie had some serious competition, but even in without comparison to that masterclass in action movie pacing, Fantastic Four does a downright awful job. It strands all the dramatics and special effects to the first hour, and only then are we introduced to any action. This could have worked, especially because the slow build of the first hour is actually maddeningly effective despite other flaws. The problem is, the action it rewards us with is some of the lamest I've ever seen. The aforementioned CGI looks awful a lot of the time, and it uses so much of it that it's impossible to pinpoint anything plausible on screen. Add to this the fact that almost all the action is confined to a relatively short coda, and you've got yourself a massive letdown.I've heard that Marvel fans are well and truly PO'd with this movie and I can't say I blame them, but I don't really know who to blame for this its quality, either. The director, Josh Trank, lures some great performances out of his actors here, especially Kate Mara (odd wig aside), but there's reports of him being abusive on set. There's also reports of Fox slicing and dicing the movie down - which may be what killed the pacing and the lopsided drama/action. Then there's the screen writing - writing that never really sinks apart from a few cheesy lines, but never really sparkles either.I think the truth may be realized by looking at the bigger picture - this movie is a failure on nearly every front.",Fantastic Four

The script is like from a cheap tv show from the 60's but with larger budget (which went god knows where since the movie and FX look bad too). There was nothing likable about any of the characters, with the exception Sue Storm, because she is pretty. The main heroes are stupid teenagers that somehow make teleportation devices. The main villain apparently set the laboratory on fire before they asked him to return to the project, for which he contributes exactly nothing, besides being a sulky jealous rooster-blocker, and ironically ends up again setting the laboratory on fire and even more than that. Who could've guessed. The funniest thing is this movie ends up being many times worse than the first Fantastic four movie, which was enough already. Now the question is - can Fox make a third - even more stupid version? I bet they can.",Fantastic Four
352,dvoon-missy-mcmuffin,Went without expectations...and boy...that chimp looks fake,3,7 August 2015,"Was hoping Josh Trank would at least gives us something along the lines of Chronicle where it was about a bunch of teens stumbling upon powers. If Avatar could so easily ripped off other movie plot lines without batting an eyelid, why not follow the formula of his past hit? These teens would then goof ball around with their powers in second act, followed by its final act of Victor Von Doom just going nuts. Why oh why? It would had been a better quality story in comparison to this gawd knows what...dud... ><I do not mind the first act of this movie, setting it up realistically. There was a chemistry there for Reed and Ben. However, when they decided to edit Ben out half way through that, I was optimistically hopeful. Then the set up continues with Reed and Sue (add a little sprinkling of Johnny into that mix for the hell of it just because the mythos called for it - not story, but the mythos of Fantastic Four)...i was like ooo-kay.They then introduced Victor into the mix, i was like uh huh. All the while enjoying the set up that they had in this first act. But the problem was, while watching the movie, i felt that this first act was going on for way too long. When were they ever getting powers?It appears that it took them half the time to get to the gist of THE Fantastic Four. By then, i was already tired of prodding along the first act, and it does not help that the Negative Zone (or whatever Planet Zero) was one boring unimpressive wasted-barren-land. zzz. Not to mention the reintroduction of Ben (just because of the mythos yet again. Not because the story needed it but because he needed to be in it again. How convenient).Finally the second act. And boy...by the first few minutes of the second act, i sensed my interest for the film was already dwindling. Second act to me was just a montage. It wasn't even story driven. It was just a montage of scenes put together to show their training (this has been done to death by all superhero movies ever since Spider Man. It is really a chore to sit through it all over again). A montage to also serve as a reason to get Reed Richards back into the story, after they so dumbfounded-ly cut him out at the start of second act. And er...the scene where Ben head butted Reed in the forest...that felt like a tangent being forced into it. yawn.And finally there was the third act. Boy oh boy...they reintroduced Doom. But the look of Doom was what distracted me from it most of the time. He looks like a walking mushroom with his hood on. At least Mario's mushrooms were cute. This Doom, to me, was just a cheap CGI or whatever. At least do a lip sync for him, for crying out loud. It doesn't help that he looks like a crash test dummy that has a voice- over. It was majority because of this Doom, that basically took me out of the movie by this time.They set Doom up as an omni-powered villain with powers that could explode heads just by his thoughts and also blocking lots of bullets by a force field of some kind. And yet...i beg to question why doesn't he just explode the heads of Reed, Ben and Johnny when they fought? Granted Sue may be able to prevent her head from exploding because she had a force field throughout. Obviously Doom knows how to control his powers in that short amount of time when he exhibited it. So why doesn't he?As an analogy, its like: We all know that a cat when confronted will always bite, hiss and scratch. But no cat will suddenly forget about those and tries to use its tail instead as a whiplash fighting mechanism. That was what Doom was to me. He forgot about his omni powers and decided otherwise. He could had easily just gaze upon each of them and exploded our heroes' head.And the final fight - it took place in the boring barren whatever land. That quickly ended as it began. Borefest.And for the love of all movie gods out there. Please do not attempt a Marvel humor at the end just because Marvel did it well, so you have to do it too. That is just following a trend rather than to set out to be innovative. And just because of that one scene alone at the end with its tacky humor...it suddenly came about much more jarring because no where in the whole run time of this movie was there such a display of cheap humor. And suddenly we had this out of place attempt to close the movie out. Sigh.My rating can only be for the first act. End rant >.<",Fantastic Four
353,Philipe14,Saturday Morning Kids' TV show here,1,12 August 2015,"As I sat through this fiasco, it kept nagging me that I've seen this sort of thing before, but I couldn't recall what movie. Then it dawned on me, it wasn't in a movie theater, it was the kind of action junk they showed on Saturday morning television when I was a kid. If only Power Rangers had shown up to salvage this mess. Nerd's science fair project touches on the borders of all known laws of physics. Nerd goes on to college where, surprise, his work completes a super-secret project the government's NASA/CIA/Area 51 scientists couldn't quite figure out. OK, this works for a comic book. For a movie, at some point the nerd needs to become an adult. That's where they dropped the ball on this one. The Reed Richards character was so miscast, it wasn't even funny. You know, how some movies are bad enough that you laugh at how bad they are? This casting choice was beyond bad. The ""parallel dimension"" planet looked like a bad imitation of Vulcan, out of Star Trek. Or a bunch of those mashed-potato mountains Richard Dreyfuss carved during dinner in Closer Encounters, with phosphorescent glow-in-the-dark gravy being poured over them. At one point, I swear I could see sunshine coming through the windows of the building where they shot the studio/set action scenes ""on the planet surface,"", before going to post-production computer animation graphics. I couldn't quite make out the wires Sue Storm was hanging from in her airborne sequences, but I swear that's how they did it, it just looks so freakin' cheap. Like the old Peter Pan show starring Mary Martin, you know - - - just pretend you don't see what you're lookin' at. The inter-dimensional travel modules were simply upsized versions of a Ronco kitchen gadget, you know, like they used to advertise on those Saturday afternoon infomercials? (""Snaffles humans into any size dimension, alternate universe, or the building next door ... and it really, really works!!!""...if only it could have sliced and diced this script...) The Human Torch is a black guy? What?? The Thing actor did a creditable job of playing a live boulder. OK, let me re-read that last sentence.....Did I really write that? A guy playing a big boulder does the best acting in this flick. Hmmm, nope. Kudos to the guy playing Thing for his spot-on portrayal of live rocks.

354,Nicknielsen99,One of the WORST Movies I've seen in awhile,3,24 August 2015,"Well, for starters; it was absolutely HORRIBLE. The only slight upside to this movie was I suppose the cast... Miles Teller shines in the Divergent series, and had high hopes for the reboot of the unsuccessful one prior 10 or some-odd years ago. Michael B. Jordan is an actor I enjoy. He plays his role well, that is in most movies, and I again had high hopes. The director, Josh Tank also directed the successful film, Chronicle which also starred Michael B. Jordan. However, like his last name; this film TANKed. It was honestly one of the most over-hyped, over budgeted, and underachieved movies I've ever looked upon. IMDb gave it a 4/10, which is ironic considering the movie is entitled the Fantastic FOUR. More like the NOTSOFANTASTIC FOUR. This was the biggest waste of 2 hours, and wasn't at all worth the $9 ticket I purchased. The part of this movie I was most looking forward to was the recreation of Dr. DOOM, and I was getting excited to see how well executed his character would have been. Yet, after seeing him for a total of 7 minutes of screen time in a nearly two hour long movie, I was again, disappointed. If you didn't enjoy the first 2 in the early 2000's, you will most definitely NOT like this film. Definite No from myself. RATING: 3/10. AGE: 11+. VERDICT: Go see Man From UNCLE as well(review on my page)",Fantastic Four
355,TheFabulousThomasJ,The Best Argument Against Rebooting!,1,8 May 2016,"You know it's pretty sad when you watch a comic-book superhero film based on a comic book series you grew up with as a child and you root for the villain to win.Case in point: the recent rebooted monstrosity of the Marvel comic series ""Fantastic Four"" starring Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell, Toby Kebbell and Tim Blake Nelson.I cannot blame the actors for this hot mess; I must credit them for doing great with a urine-poor script and therein lies the blame.And that credit goes to the writers Jeremy Slater, Simon Kimber and Josh Trank. I think crystal-meth addicts could have turned in a much-better script.I will not waste you time and go into details of this piece of merde except to say if you must watch the ""Fantastic Four"" buy or rent the 2005 film starring Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis.That version will not disappoint you like the 2015 reboot will.",Fantastic Four

This reboot is definitely worth watching: I don't get why I should feel ashamed of liking this short but awesome blockbuster. The poor director must feel so bad about making this. He shouldn't feel sad. I thought it was great how they changed it because making something different is better than copying the comic. I can't say everyone but most people say that the movie and the characters have to look the same as the comics, still who cares, that writing in the poster that says ""change is coming"" it was actually true. I don't think it was so bad because they had great actors, an awesome plot changing from space to inter-dimension travel which I think was great, they a diabolically awesome villain which in the comics is a hippy turned into lord of Latveria and in the movie is a genius turned into a demon.So just don't think all the other reviews are true and try to enjoy this movie.",Fantastic Four

To be honest the movie was alright until ""Dr. Doom (villain form)"" showed up, and yes the movie was doomed from there on out. I was expecting a build up, an action packed Fantastic 4 film but instead a draggy, dark, terribly done film. The character development was awful and the CGI....was AWFUL. A movie in 2015, a blockbuster summer action packed film? With this CGI? No. It was bad. Back to when Dr. Doom showed up. He looked awful but since he ""shows up,"" the movie seems to be rushed and ends. No post credits and just a movie that made me feel bad because i wanted this movie to succeed in the first place. Bad flow and CGI....a really bad film.",Fantastic Four
358,Charles_Carmichael,"So much promise, so much lost",5,9 August 2015,"In a guilty way I enjoyed the last two films, so when I heard of this reboot I was kind of curious. Then came the trailer and it was 'Okay', then then film, far too much time in trying to back story every single character and every single plot point, too little time in engaging the audience.The action scenes, when done were great, but far too few, which made for dead time, and a lot of it.I did enjoy Kate Mara as Sue Storm, but that maybe bias on my part.IF there is a sequel it needs to learn from the mistakes on this film, although I suspect 20th Century Fox will reboot this to retain licensing when the time comes.",Fantastic Four
359,er_ouz,I really enjoyed it!,7,1 December 2015,"Considering the score this movie got on IMDb, I was expecting it to be horrible, yet to my surprise, found myself totally engaged throughout the movie and thoroughly enjoying it! I was never a fan of the fantastic four, as I found them too wholesome and boring- but in this movie a dark undertone makes for a more interesting and less obvious plot line.There are several elements missing from the film- it lacks both humour and sex appeal, and it could really (really) have used another action scene and a bigger climax.That being said, I did like that it was a 90 minute film- which used to be the normal movie length- and allows you to keep concentrated and comfortable rather then those unbelievably long movies they insist in making nowadays though everybody always says how they hate it. And during the 90 minutes I found myself enjoying every second of the film. I do wish they had a better climax though, as you do feel slightly empty once the movie ends- but still, I would recommend it for a fun evening.",Fantastic Four
360,sinsro,Unnecessary reboot,1,10 August 2015,"This movie spends most of the time telling the story of how the superheroes lived before they got their powers. A story most already knows, and I was just waiting for them to get that part over with so the real movie can begin. Unfortunately, by that time you will most likely be asleep, and wont be able to enjoy the five minutes or so of superhero action at the end.Maybe they didn't have the budget for special effects and instead decided to fill most of the time with boring dialogs. Nevertheless, you'd have more fun just picking up a comic book and read that instead.Waste of your time, even if you're a fan of the comics like me.",Fantastic Four

362,gsurveil1,Fantastic 4 not so fantastic!,2,12 August 2015,"I have to be honest my comrades of film a 3.9 rating was far too kind. Bare with me don't stop reading yet. I waited almost a week to watch Fan4 so I could let the critics have time to critique it. I went in with low expectations so I could give the film a chance unlike others did. My conclusion is it was one of the worst big budget films I've seen in many years. Problem 1,it was miscast. Miles Teller should have been Johnny Storm because he is known for quick witted,fast talking and comedic dialogue while Michael B. Jordan would've been a perfect fit for Reed Richards because he is well known for more serious roles and has leader-type qualities. That would've made them more relevant, and believe me folks no one is relevant in this film, so much so that the rest of the cast isn't worth mentioning. The cast never really clicked or come of as likable. At times it seemed as if they really didn't care for each other, a total lack of chemistry. The writing was woeful. Every line uttered was generic and seemed forced. The CGI was so bad that it depressed me. With all the tech today you'd figure the human torch would look awesome. Nope! The directing was....well I'm not sure the director was present. The editing was...I don't think they had editing. All in all this movie should have been broadcast on a regular network channel. It doesn't deserve our hard earned money and Marvel/Fox should give everyone there money back and promise, no swear they will not make a sequel! Watch at your risk, I tried to warn you!",Fantastic Four
363,Jumova,Really good movie.,8,11 August 2015,"I don't understand what the negative fuzz is all about. IMHO F4 was a really good movie for the way it was made. In present days I have always missed a director that takes his time for the story to evolve and that finally happened in f4. OK, the is not much boom boom and no car chases but if you let yourself into the story I promise you, you will enjoy the movie and will be stoked about the following ones.I liked they took time for everything to get into place before the action starts. How it all started, how the teleporting machine was made, etc.I would compare this movie with the Robocop remake. It's hopefully the first of several movies and we only got to see the prologue and it was made without rushing it into the action.I hope we get to see more of what we got a glimpse on in this one From me ALL THUMBS UP!",Fantastic Four
364,harbingerofapocalypse,Not Deserving of the Hate,7,25 May 2017,"I didn't expect much and wasn't overly excited to see this, but I thought the trailers made it look cool and I go for the dark, brooding style over the more colorful, hyper style of something like Avengers. Another caveat is that I'm not a comic book purist by any means. If you can stick to the source material and make it good, awesome. But I also fully believe that not everything good in comic form (or any written material) makes a good transfer to film, and even if it's good, some change can make it better. So they made the human torch dude black, or altered this or that event in the storyline. Big f'ing deal, you gd children. It's a comic book - chill. Take all that into consideration I guess when I tell you I'm absolutely stunned at the level of vitriol heaped upon this film. It wasn't great, sure. But I truly have never seen a movie more undeserving of it horrid reputation. Yes, the ending was rushed and you could tell that, yet again, a bunch of studio suits and hacks thought they could put together a film better than real filmmakers. I do believe that Trank's original vision would likely have been great, from what I've heard and from what made it on screen. Even with the studio butchery though, it was more than passably entertaining. Actors were all fine, effects were up to snuff - even the Thing. Story-wise it was the first in a presumed series, so yeah, you expect a lot of set-up - giving back stories, bringing the team together, etc. It's really too bad that there won't be a second. I think what you have here mostly is a case Asperger/Autistic/Borderline Personality Disorder obsessives that have freaked out because it didn't adhere to the source material to the letter, so they complain and then make up all kinds of other invalid reasons to hate it on top of that. I don't care enough to be bogged down by that kind of bs, so I enjoyed it.",Fantastic Four
365,Win-5,Don't delay the action!,7,10 December 2016,"I gave this a 7/10 for the high production values - the alien setting and the high-tech devices and especially Ben's CGI were all great, just what you'd want in a FF story.But sheesh, will someone please tell Hollywood that we don't need to start every FF movie, every superhero movie, with the origin story? This is an hour-and-a half movie, and they spent half of that laying the groundwork for the stuff that should have appeared in the first five minutes. Please START a superhero movie with the superheroes! START a Fantastic Four movie with Ben in his rocky-skinned glory, lifting heavy equipment while Johnny zooms his flames around and Reed tweaks dials from 30 feet away! Explain the details later, but start with the action! Show a few hints at the very beginning how Sue's powers, simple as they may be, are actually the strongest of the bunch! Any by the way, Doom's comic-book origin is pretty good (viz the current Dr Strange movie), so there's no need to warp it into this new FF origin.No, this movie has to lay the groundwork, and make sure we see tech people doing tech things, and spend boring time in labs and offices and with an unnaturally-low-pitched Daddy Storm telling us how ""these kids"" are so wonderful.

Anyways, my wife and I couldn't believe how bad this was and sat through it to see if it would get better...never did.One doesn't have to go further thank this trivia comment to understand how/why this film was so bad...""Kate Mara had initially wanted to read Fantastic Four comic books to prepare for her role as Susan Storm, but the filmmakers explained to the cast that it was unnecessary as the film was an original story not based directly on the comics.""

367,KyleBel,"An Honest Review of Fantastic 4, it was Okay.",7,10 September 2015,"(TBH this movie deserves a 6/7 rating, but not the 9% it has on RT and 4/10 here on IMDb) I have seen a handful of the marvel franchise movies, and I have to say Guardians of the Galaxy was my favorite so far. I'm a big fan of Chris Pratt, that being said I'm also a big fan of Miles Teller (If you haven't seen Whiplash, do yourselves a favor and see it)Now to review this movie. Fantastic 4 was not overly fantastic, but it was a good movie. It had all the elements in the story, and a very strong cast that needed some better direction on screen. It felt like a lot of the lines or scenes fell flat, because of bad direction, not necessarily bad acting. There was a hint of chemistry between the main cast, but I never really felt connected to the group as a whole. While they did do some work to establish some of the relationships, a lot of it was just done with exposition; which is lazy. --Spoiler Maybe?--- I'm not sure if this is a spoiler, because we all know there will be a fight scene with Doom. While this scene was executed well, it felt horribly rushed. I feel like we spent 3/4 of the movie setting up this scene that felt like it lasted 5 minutes. Also there wasn't any satisfaction from the fight scene, it felt like they overcame him way way to easily. This has got to be the thing that upset me most about this movie, when I see a fight scene that we have been waiting for the entire movie, I really want to see my protagonist characters put every bit of their effort into beating the antagonist. That being said, the 5 - 10 minutes of fight scene that was there, was pretty visually stunning. However, I had some mixed feelings about who I should be rooting for. I mean in one hand they set up Doom in a way you feel sympathy for him, and they show him as ""weak"" to start, but then out of nowhere Doom is the bad ass we were expecting, with a mission to destroy Earth to save his planet. I just felt like they could have done a little more to set up ""Dooms"" character and his objective. Now the moral of Fantastic 4 is ""Team Work"" and this is something else that was sporadically set up throughout the movie, but was not executed well at the end. You'll see for yourself if you decide to see it. This movie is worthy of a Redbox rental, but he had the potential to be one of the greatest Marvel movies to date. I think this is why so many people are upset and being so harsh on the movie, because it had so much potential and fell pretty flat. 4/10 Directing by Trank was lazy, and this can be seen in the acting, and execution of important scenes. 4/10 Writing was not strong. It felt rushed, it felt like ideas where there, but didn't have time to get flushed out and put together properly. 5/10 Acting, what a great cast, and such amazing potential. However, the cast did not end up working, and I feel like the bad chemistry or lack of chemistry we saw on screen has to do with bad directing, and one overly confusing script. 10/10 Sound track, cinematography, and visual effects. The real heroes of this movie are the ones behind the scenes. The DP, the VFX supervisor, the artist, the editors. They put together some stunning visuals, some amazing lighting, beautiful sets, and overall deserve much praise for the great job they did here. To bad it was wasted on a unfinished script, horrible directing, and a talented cast that just didn't have it all together.",Fantastic Four
368,ioshadha,Underrated,7,19 December 2015,"I rated this 7.Let's get the obvious out... Yes, it is true for a Marvel movie Fantastic Four (F4) contains little action. And the first half of the movie feels too slow. And the movie runtime is approximately 90min which leaves very short time to construct a good phase unless the script and the storyline are done very intelligently. But, I very much enjoyed the efforts and how much careful thought has been put in building up the story. All four characters are detailed extremely well prior to being F4. Action was good but too short too little and feels inadequate. Like I said earlier, if the movie had another 30min more to accommodate the action followed by the detail start of the movie the end result would have been much different. At the end of the movie it felt like taking a quick short break before flick start watching the next F4 movie because this movie was all about setting the start for a series of upcoming movies.I don't blame voters who rate this film low. I get it. It's a Marvel movie and you need freaking action in it. But if you view this movie in a more open eye you can see the details and how the director attempted to make the reboot of F4 different to the let down original F4 series.All and all it was a good movie.

370,andrewshieh0712,Go watch the older version.,5,9 August 2015,"Fant4stic might be one of the worst superhero movies for quite a while. I have to be honest that it actually looks very good when the trailer first came out, it has a wonderful cast, a promising director who brought us Chronicle, and it's a Marvel movie! How bad could it be? However, Fox ruins it again. I went into the movies expecting to see something very, very bad after looking up the reviews, regardless on IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, or the reviews on Yahoo Movies (Taiwan). Every one of them said how Fant4stic it is. and I guess they're right.The first act of the movie is actually pretty good. You get to see Reed Richards and Ben growing up, which kind of reminded me of the intro of the Guardians of the Galaxies. To me, it seems like a good start.However, Fant4stic is extremely boring. At first, it does look good when it introduces each character and doing their researches, but it really bores you out when it didn't make any progress after 70 minutes of unnecessary dialogs. I kept yawning and checking the time on my phone throughout the movie. Yes, the cinematography does look good, but there are no action sequences but inferior-quality special effects. Seriously, the movie makes you doubt was there a problem with its budget.The third act is where I hated the most. When you finally receive that fight scene you've all been waiting for (after 80 minutes), the villain just died within 10 minutes. This might be one of the weakest and worst villains I've seen in a movie. Dr. Doom finally appeared in the last 20 minutes. He got send back to Earth, he went insane, he started killing people, he went back to his planet, and then he got killed. All of these happened within 15 minutes. That 15 minutes simply just made me hated the movie even more after all of the boredom. Oh, and the ending, I'm speechless. I really like Miles Tellers as an actor, but what he concluded in the movie really wanted you to punch him in the face real hard. That was one of the cheesiest dialogue I've heard, not in a romantic way. I have no idea what these producers and screenwriters were thinking when they had such a talented cast to say such idiotic lines. That ending just made the audience sighing and sneering while they leave for the exit. When you actually look back to the 2005 version of Fantastic Four which wasn't that great as a superhero film, Fant4stic actually really makes you wanna re-watch the 2005 one again. At least, the 2005 has enough action sequences, and I'm not saying about those awful 100% CGI battle scenes in Fant4stic, I want to see the streets, the cars, the citizens. I want a sense of humanity which makes it actually make the 4 real superheroes. I'm really disappointed with Fant4stic and all I can say about the positives of this movie is that it has good cinematography and good performances that not always worked well. The rest of the movie is just clichéd and lifeless. I think Fant4stic really took itself too seriously; it has a very strange atmosphere just like having a dark atmosphere in an Adam Sandler movie. But the truth is, it isn't good enough to put it on a shelf with the other Marvel or DC superhero movies. It just doesn't fits. Lastly, just don't go watch it in the theaters. Go watch the 2005 version. At least it gives you a couple chuckles and enough fighting scenes to satisfy you.",Fantastic Four
371,mcgregorrowland,Worst Marvel movie I have ever seen,2,10 August 2015,"What in the heck happened with this movie! It looked so good. But it turned out just to be a flop. Everything about this movie was bad. The acting, action, directing, plot, and character development was all horrendous. This movie was a huge disappointment.First off, the acting was terrible. Josh Trank did a horrible job directing the actors with their emotions and saying their lines without making you cringe. Michael B. Jordan was the worst of the group and his acting was horrible. And, surprisingly, Miles Teller's acting was really weak and I expected a lot more from him. The only person who did decent was Kate Mara. I guess you can say Jamie Bell did good but all he did was mostly a voice over, which was all right for The Thing.The development of them becoming super heroes was really bad. They gained powers and then the screen said ""one year later"" and they were pros with their powers. The film did not even show how they adapted to their powers which is what we all want to see in the first film of a super hero series.The plot was so stupid. First of all the movie was way too short and all they did was spend %90 of the movie making a machine and traveling to another world and gaining powers. Then the villain appears and they have a 10 minute fight scene and the movie is over. This was very frustrating as you only got to see Dr. Doom for like 20 minutes.The action was so lame and there was nothing new and creative in the movie. All we saw was action that was decent for the old Fantastic Four movies.I gave this movie a 2 just because the CGI was alright and because of Mara's acting.If you love Marvel movies, don't go see this disappointing film and save your money.",Fantastic Four

After all the bad reviews and negative buzz, I really had little intention of seeing this film. However, I found myself with nothing else to do this afternoon and my curiosity got the better of me. I had to see just how bad it could really be? The answer.. Not bad at all! In fact, I liked it! I liked it a lot! I'm not saying it's the greatest movie I've ever seen or anything, but it was really pretty good. I'm excited that they have decided to go through with the sequel. I won't let negative reviews turn me away next time. Maybe it was because I went in with such low expectations, or maybe, just maybe it really is a pretty good film after all. Which leads me to my conspiracy theory. I'm usually not real big on such things. I'm mostly an I'll believe it when I see it type of guy. But in this case I've seen it. So why all the bad reviews and negative press on an otherwise competent film? Is Disney trying to pressure Fox into selling back the rights? By hook or crook? I have to believe... maybe! I just don't see any other explanation. I was sitting there waiting for the thing to fall apart as the reviews had said it would, but it never did. It stayed fairly solid all the way through. The cast was good. The story was good. The effects were good. The script was OK. Even the editing was effective.

374,xecutionrecords,Abandon all hope ye who enter here!,1,11 August 2015,"Looking at how the world of superhero movies today has evolved from it's first steps, the early attempts before cgi like 'Captain America' and the Corman 'Fantastic Four' to the signs of possibility laid out by the first Blade movie (For me the pre-cursor to the modern age of SH franchises) all the way up to the giddy heights of 'The Avengers', 'The Dark Knight' & 'Winter Soldier' pretty much the blueprint that all SH movies should be judged against, it seems strange to me that anybody can walk into Josh Tranks 'Fantastic Four' and come out feeling anything but betrayed. 20th Century Fox's cash grab attempt to hold on to the rights of characters they care nothing for is at best an embarrassment to snigger at when you have had a few & at worst perhaps the most inept movie to come from a big studio since, well..ever! To sum up this movie is almost nie-on impossible in a small review here, it's probably best just to read the spate of negative reviews, The first 10 or so on here should be sufficient enough for you just to get a handle on what Fox has cut & pasted together & called a movie. As a betrayal to loyal comic fans & cinema goers in general, Fox has managed to create a film so bad & so blatantly unforgiving in it's awfulness that anyone with half a cinema brain will simply just be picking there jaw up from the ground after the final painful reel (If you thought the Electro-Spider-man face off in ASM 2 was bad, wait till you see Dr Doom's few scenes in this) Of course the blame game & excuses began even before the first audiences started tearing it a new one. It's all well & good to play around & tinker with characters & stories from an original base but if you are going to do it with characters beloved by millions the world over you better make it fresh & relevant which this new rendition, sadly, is the exact opposite. It's highly unlikely that Trank finished this movie by himself, it does have the feel of 3 or 4 different movies strewn together in the same way young Reed Richards pieces his time displacement device in the opening scenes, a bit of junk from this yard, an old car battery, a line of dialogue from that movie, an idea from that Fox exec etc etc. The end result is like watching tumbleweed, it just goes on & on, never going to any one place, sometimes even travelling without moving. If Chronicle showed us anything it's that Trank has a grasp of this genre & has vision, there is nothing here on show that displays any of this and it's far more believable a story to think that the studio that looks at there comic franchises as green machines only took control of it long before the director had any chance of fully forming his take and as such we will probably never ever really know what this was. Much like Alien 3 and David Fincher, a saga more famous than the film itself, Fantastic Four 2015 will always be remembered as a jumbled mess rather than something great to finally put to rest the old 'They'll never make a good FF movie' myth. No doubt the blame game will continue as much as the bad reviews until it's finally forgotten about and dug up for an Empire magazine dissection 20 years from now. Will Trank be given this kind of opportunity again? or have Fox killed a promising career? the proof is in the final product & if he is given a chance at redemption i sincerely hope he manages to shirk off the negativity that this pile of steaming (insert your own word here) has garnered him. To understand the anger that's directed towards this film one must go back to the first 100 issues of the FF, a run of stories so immaculately formed by Lee & Kirby that reading them today it astounds that no one has had the idea of actually adapting them for a modern audience. My guess is that's the FF movie that everybody wants to watch. Sadly for now it seems the real fantastic is still in the 60's comics rather than anywhere on screen so, 'Will anybody be able to make a good FF movie?' it continues.....",Fantastic Four

To be honest I thought it was going to be good, at least better than the 2005 take on it but I was wrong. The trailer had some things in it that weren't in the film which made the film worse than I thought it'd be.I recently realized that all Marvel films since 2008 have been around 2 hours and take 30 minutes to tell an origin story. This one however lasts only 100 minutes and it takes more than half that time to set up an origin story that we already know and don't care for anymore. I could live with the first 50 minutes if the film would have been 30 minutes longer where it actually showed more of the Fantastic four. The end is rushed and not at all imaginative because we have seen it in a lot of other superhero films.The cast is not interesting, the characters have no chemistry or fun together. I honestly liked the ones from 2005 better, Sue Storm and Reed Richards were better than then than now. They still can't get metaphors right and just call the bad guy victor Von doom (seems like drax from guardians)I can't even call this a Marvel film because it's not at all good like the ones from the MCU. I also saw that there's a sequel coming in 2017 and from all the sequels that are coming in 2017 (Guardians 2, Thor 3, Spiderman reboot etc.) this is the one I won't watch.I'm just so mad that they can't make a good Fantastic four film.

378,asindt98,Boring and dull.,4,21 October 2015,"Fantastic Four 40Before I came to see this, I had heard that this was pretty much a trash film; and well it is one of the worst films that I have seen. I don't usually hate films or trash on them, this is mostly a bad/mixed review. Yes, for me it still somewhat entertained me; even though everything about it was dull and boring. I just enjoy movies that much that honestly not very many are truly boring for me. First off, this has got to be one of the most wasted films of the year. It had great potential, a set of good actors, and they could do anything with the story. The worst thing about this film though is that just about none of it was that interesting. Everything was way too predictable and nothing new was put in. The performances the actors gave gave a sense of dullness and ""I don't want to be here."" Okay, these next parts are based off of heard rumors or my own predictions. Rumors had it that the director Josh Trank came to set drunk out of his mind, so if that is true then, most of the blame has got to go to him. If you told somebody that just got done watching this film that the director was drunk while filming they'd would agree and could see that possibility. Also, I think that the big movie studios that only care about the money sort of ruined this. The story had some promise in it in near about halfway through, but I'm sure some studio officials had it changed for some reason. In the end bad plot, dull characters, dull mood, and boringness overall bring this film down.",Fantastic Four
379,justincrunden,Fantastic fun!!,7,10 October 2016,"Fantastic Four has been panned, slated, written off as rubbish and confined to room 101 by all and sundry. I almost decided I would never give it a watch purely based on the amount of negative reviews of this Film. I'm also happy to say how glad I am that against all previous judgements I decided to give it a watch. I can tell you right now that it is not the best superhero film I have ever watched but it never lost me for a minute. The plot is great, the anticipation is good, the acting is good, and the special effects are very good. It is well worth a watch and you should not let yourself be put off by bad reviews. When I see someone has given it a one then for me that person should not be allowed to continue to give reviews on IMDb as in my opinion they have been lazy and irresponsible. Fantastic Four has all the events of a good superhero film but it is not as grandiose as a lot of the other Marvel and DC movies. For me it is not always a bad thing to be a little more understated as long as the story is good which it is in this case. For me a good example would be Superman Returns which was grandiose and boring and lacked any imagination or heart. Fantastic Four has plenty of heart and sometimes people are so quick to judge a film based on all the little boxes they feel it should tick that they lose sight of the fact that a film made with heart will still shine through regardless of whether it conforms to the typical stereotype of the genre. All in all this has felt more like a rant than a review but my message is, don't be put off by the 4 rating, watch it and see for yourself!!",Fantastic Four
380,sleepyhat,Should have just made a new super hero team,4,16 September 2015,"Having watched comics and 2005 version, one thing bothered me most is, why even do a reboot? The whole new storyline deserves its own name, why even bother using Fantastic Four, where only the characters' powers are similar. Why not change their powers entirely or somewhat, and name it The Teen Mutant or something.If the name had been different, powers altered, and the storyline a bit more condensed and packed, I would give it a better score, at least more than 6. For a reboot on a long standing comic, I can really feel it for folks who really adore the comic, 4 is a merciful number.",Fantastic Four
381,AleNapoli,Insufficient Movie,5,27 January 2018,"The film is a reboot with a completely different but interesting storyline. The problem with this film is that there is little action in fact the film is based more on the completion of the project of the protagonists than the fight. Another problem is the duration of only 20 minutes of the bad in fact the scene of the ""Final Battle"" lasts very little and many important characters have made them become secondary as ""The Thing"".",Fantastic Four
382,Propagandist,I actually liked it,7,20 December 2015,"Decades ago - in my youth - I actually was more of a DC guy, so I only read a few of the Fantastic Four comics. Therefore I apologize in advance to all fans of the books who might not find their favourite stories depicted adequately by this movie. As I said I only read a few of the stories decades ago, so my only comparison is with the 2005 film. So in my opinion this one is much better. I never liked the candy coloured tone of the first one, admitting that its sequel was better. I prefer the darker and more serious tone of this one. I also liked a lot that the movie took its time to develop the character, making them more complex and believable - even if this has the word: ""sequel"" written all over it. Especially Victor van Doom who is not the smug, arrogant and selfish villain, but a good guy who has been betrayed and now tries to protect his new world, even if this means the destruction of his old one. So to sum things up: I believe anyone who claims the movie does not do justice to its origin. However regarded as an action film on its own it has everything I want: good effects, good acting, believable but slightly broken characters and an interesting story even if it stays open ended.",Fantastic Four
383,Mahmood-Buttrumps,Just say no to herd-think,10,6 February 2016,"What's all the Fuss about ? The way people were critical of this movie I expected it to be hideous, a waste of time and a hot mess! As I watched it, I thought it was interesting and the characters were well drawn, except for Ben Grimm I think should have been someone with the ""Flatbush/Yancy Street"" attitude, also, physically bigger and a college athlete type (like the comic book). The story veered from the comics as a lot of the superhero movies do, but this version was fascinating and well done. And Victor Von Doom, don't know what all the criticism was but this version was very powerful and scary, and had powers not found in the comic storyline, but with an open mind, you could definitely see a lot here to appreciate. By the end of the movie, I was like ""WTF"", this is as good as any of the other superhero movies. This was a very good movie. Check this movie out for yourself and don't listen to the campaign of naysayers, make up your own mind on this movie. This is a movie I've been waiting months to see.

387,residentevil6901,Liked it but,6,22 March 2017,"It was cool and all, I have always loved super heroes since I was a little kid in the 70s reading most the comic books. I've been waiting decades for them to finally get around to making some of the movies they have today like the Avengers and soon Justice League, I of course wanted to see those on the big screen when I was little. But now that we're finally getting all these super hero movies I'm not complaining. I would've rather they made Fantastic Four part 3 instead of this one but I know how it goes most the time in Hollywood.Anyway I finally got around to watching this one a few days ago and I thought it was okay but it was a big let down. Basically another origin story and I did enjoy most of it until the big fight at the end. Very disappointed they have the big fight on the foreign planet and it really wasn't even that big of a fight. I think if the ending was done a little bit better I would've liked it even more. Regardless it was just kind of bland / plain. It really was nothing to get excited over and nothing to get upset over. It made me think of one of those kids you knew back in school who were there daily, they didn't talk much, you kind of saw them around but you really didn't know them.",Fantastic Four
388,talizen,An embarrassment to all comic book fans,2,26 February 2016,"First off I want to say that this movie was such an embarrassment to all comic book fans including me. I am a true comic book fan who loves movies that are like around 90% perfect; for example, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, by far the best Marvel movie ever made but this one is the worst comic book movie I have ever seen in my life since Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance. I'm just glad I didn't waste my money by going to the cinemas because I watched this movie online.Now secondly what I want to talk about is the movie; the dialogue, the script, the storyline, the cast, they are horrible. The only thing I only enjoyed that was decent were the action and the design of the Thing. With the script, it's all terrible, the humour Fox put in the script is not funny at all. They think they can put in better humour in the script than the original Fantastic Four movie back in 2005, unfortunately that's a failure. I really don't like what Fox did to the storyline, they think it is okay to change the story to make something new for the comic fans to love. Well guess what, it failed! Instead of going out of space and then get powers, they go to another dimension on another planet and then they get powers. At first, it looks okay to go to another planet and get powers which is kind of decent but it is still a terrible story.And now the cast. What should I say about the cast? Oh yeah, worst cast ever! (But don't get me wrong, they are good actors in other movies though). Fox casted a bunch of college looking actors when the actual Fantastic 4 characters are adults. I don't mean to be racist or anything, but I seriously don't like the cast of Johnny Storm/Human Torch as a black guy. They even cast an actor who is not even tough and bulky for Ben Grimm/The Thing. Miles Teller is a good actor, don't get me wrong, but the only problem is that he can't do Reed Richards/Mr Fantastic right. Kate Mara is a good actress, I like her but she also couldn't entirely do Susan Storm/Invisible Woman right either. But he comes the worst part, Fox even made Susan adopted to Johnny Storm, not blood related siblings. Not a great cast for Victor Von Doom though but he was OK (slightly), but I was horrified for what they did to Doctor Doom. They made him look like C-3PO on drugs, like crystal meth or something. Just horrible.Have the cast even read the comics or has Fox forgot to read the comics? Seriously! Watching this movie felt like I was being punched in the stomach by Fox. I almost blamed director Josh Trank for the Fantastic Four failure until I realized from what I saw online that it wasn't his fault, it was Fox who f**ked up the movie.Fox! If you are reading this, give the F4 rights back to Marvel!!!",Fantastic Four
389,RachelUndercover,Don't Bother,3,14 August 2015,"This movie from the trailer looks absolutely amazing. However when it comes down to the actual movie it really disappointed me. The only real good thing about this film is the special effects (6/10), maybe Fox should have spent less time on effects and more time on the story line. The idea is great and really deserves a well made movie. I also enjoyed who they had cast for each role, but what they where given annoys me. Personally I think Marvel should have taken Fantastic Four back from Fox like they did with Spider-Man. If they do go ahead with the second film I won't be watching it. If you haven't seen this film already just putting it simply don't bother.",Fantastic Four
390,eyesore-87051,Unfaithful to the original comic book.,1,12 June 2016,"The movie industry is making mistake after mistake. It started with the first Spiderman movie. Parker gets unmasked apparently just to selfishly show the actor's face. So they sacrifice the secret that only the audience or reader was supposed to know. His true identity!Then they really went off the deep end in Fantastic Four 2015. Trank was apparently PROUD he didn't follow the original comic book.For the next FF, I think it would be good if they made the entire cast black. They could also have Sue and Johnny have an incestuous relationship while making Reed and Ben gay. I'm sure that would pack 'em in!I seriously doubt I'll bother to go see another superhero movie. And I grew up with those comics. I used to get a kick out of them. But they've taken political correctness to the Nth degree and I'm not going to pay another dime to see any again. This review probably won't pass the political correctness test, but that's OK. Then the industry doesn't find out about their mistakes until they go belly up.

I would definitely put it above TASM2 and Fan4 didn't even have romance. Maybe all the hate lowered my expectations so much that I ended up being pleasantly surprised. I was on board the film for about 3/4 of it. But when Victor reentered the picture that's when it took the nose dive. I will say that the 2 things I hate about the Fantastic 4 is the orange rock monster and plastic man aka Reed Richards, but I was amazed that in this film I didn't find their abilities ridiculous. Reeds stretching actually looked cool.Overall I will say it was passable and I don't understand why it got so much hate, its not like it was a Star Wars prequel.",Fantastic Four
394,cindyslove79,Fantastic 4 are now mass murders through inaction?,1,10 September 2015,"The movie for story is around a 3-4 elementary level story complexity. Nothing wrong with that many action movies have that and this is based off a comic book so we cant expect story perfection over.one base concept that they destroyed for any kids of the fantastic 4 for all time. and that is no action done by the fantastic 4 will lead to the death of others. What am I talking about. simply by them making a choice to do nothing caused human beings to stand no chance of being. its simple 1 in the scene where doom is sucking up the world there is a road with lots of traffic next to a secret military facility 1 ya right 2 when they go to other dimension all these vehicles go to other world and get sucked into a matter to energy converter. Invisible woman shields it so. Things stop going through.so first off a ton of people likely civilians stopped existing then all the people in the vehicles which had people at the end not a one of the 4 went to save back to our world3rd when they destroy doom who is powering this open gate when he pass's it would close instantly, or the gate would not close soon as they pass through it after it closes back to our world. so the logic sucks. Now the fantastic four through in action are responsible for the death of unknown casualties themselves.because of simple inaction for all times to any kid who watched the movie. There is no take backs for that one. that would in itself annoy their comic origin fans for all time, then add the cheesy story. and the low rating the movie got was incredibly kind even if it was a story on the level of elementary school it did in its own way make sense. Still was a weak story even if another possible way they came into being. then given when they as for a place to work a super lab YA RIGHT though to be fair how many hero's stop in the middle of a villain fight go for civilian people What am I talking about after the fight when doom is dead,they didn't go to see if anyone survived. before they went through the gate in the air back to earth to take back with them still don't really recall many super hero movies actually showing he hero looking after the aftermath Yes they don't do that but at the same time under the situation anyone who knows cars went through would see if anyone was alive. even if the chance was 1 in a billion they would still look. anyone who knows cars went through which they could see would do so the fantastic four who are the Savior's of mankind now don't care about the little guy the normal ma and pa average Joe.

395,madmaxmedia,Fantastic Four out of Ten,4,31 October 2015,"Wow, a lot of problems with this movie. Since this is approximately half of a decent superhero movie, I will give it 4 out of 10. I'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since I don't remember most of the details any more (even though I just watched the movie), and don't want to bother looking them up.Considering this is an origin story, none of the characters are well-developed at all, even the one given the most background and screen time (Reed Richards, the stretchy guy.) Most of the characters come across as rather pouty and petulant. I think the characters had potential but spend most of the movie reacting to everyone/everything around them, rather than doing/choosing anything on their own (individually or collectively as a group), and as a result seem undeverdeveoped and not very well characterized. At one point Reed Richards disappears for a year, we never actually learn what he is doing during that time. Weird.The most egregious error is that so much time is (ineffectually) spent during the build-up, there is no time to establish the antagonist, and instead of a satisfying finally third of the movie we get a really quick battle scene to end the movie. I have read about problems between the director and the studio, but given how weak the final movie was I doubt a much better version could have been assembled during editing.Many have criticized the movie as being too dark in tone. I actually don't mind the darker tone of the movie at all, in fact a different direction gives a superhero movie new possibilities and directions to explore. Too bad none of them were realized.",Fantastic Four
396,Old_Man_From_Scene_24,Did I just laugh or up-chuck?,1,8 August 2015,"Honestly, I'm not sure, but that's beside the point.Anyway, the ""Fantastic Four""... I think a renaming is in order, to be honest. I prefer Flummoxed Foursome. The Flummoxed Foursome are bland, unequivocally boring characters. They remind me of the room. Not the movie, but just an empty room, with nothing in it but bareness. It's a bit like building up a fancy four-bedroom joint, then remembering you forgot about the furniture and the roof (yes, that is a snipe at the budget leading to this mess).Of course, big movies with big budgets flopping at the box office is not a new occurrence, but when you create something this terrible with an estimated $120 million, you have to ask yourself what went wrong. For me, it's perfectly simple. The Fancy-less Four as characters have no personalities to speak of, and with the addition of a script laced with time-skips and nothing else, there was always going to be a serious problem with pacing. I think Doom gets half an hour of screen time, if that. Maybe. I was so bored by the time his first appearance came around that I stopped keeping track. And that's precisely the problem. I sat through movies like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and even then I wasn't as bamboozled by the lack of... well, anything, as I was with this movie. The incongruity surrounding a would-be clichéd plot of heroes banding together is stifled by the fact that the entire run time consists of build-up, with one final act so jilted and rushed it feels like Josh Trank forgot superhero movies are supposed to have action sequences and hastily threw it in near the end of production.Now for my favourite part of any review... acting. Wait, there were actors in this movie?! I forgot... almost. Miles Teller is simply a miscast actor, and has zero chemistry with his fellow leads. He is the most uninspiring lead in a superhero movie since the Dragonfly in Superhero Movie, but at least that was deliberately satirical. Jamie Bell and Kate Mara seem bored with the proceedings, but the crowning ace is undoubtedly Michael B. Jordan. Here we see an actor so arrogant and pretentious it's insulting to the viewer. I imagine getting smacked around the face with a wet fish is less painful than watching his performance. Or maybe getting stabbed with a swordfish is a close second. The truth is, I don't care for the controversy surrounding his casting. I only judge him as an actor... and he does so little in this movie that isn't awful that that's my judgement complete. In short, don't watch. Just don't. Seriously. A lobotomy on a Friday night might be a more entertaining alternative. This movie is just flat out boring, and has, I think, killed any chance of ever seeing the Fantastic Four have the big screen portrayal comic book fans deserve. The Fantastic Four are now the Farcical Flagbearers of Trank's less- than-appealing method of directing and I, for one, am disappointed.And amused.",Fantastic Four
397,thethomasboy,The Non Sequi-Four,2,18 May 2019,"Let's be honest. No one is reading reviews of this movie to decide if it's worth watching (spoiler alert: it's NOT). We read these because we were conned into wasting our time, want to share our disdain, and possibly squeeze SOME entertainment from this train wreck. So let the bashing begin.Choose a direction Josh Trank. Or Fox. Or someone. The film is a tasteless stew, made up of leftover cliches, and spoiled by too many cooks. Add 20 minutes dull, joyless, and amazingly-monotoned John Hughes film. Mix in a low-rent Fast and Furious, because Johnny (Michael B Jordan) is a rebellious engineer. Then a few mins of Project Almanac, add in Avengers (cause teammates gotta fight), and bring to a boil with a 10 minute head-popping snuff film (because evil guy is evil). Garnish with a half-hour, unintelligible, third act calamity and serve with a ham-handed denouement complete with humorless-jokes.Was there ANYTHING of value in this dumpster fire? Well, far and away the best ingredient of this bland mess was about 7 minutes of a body-horror film, which did show true promise. It was an intriguing take on the superhero genre, but ultimately only served to highlight how uninspired the remainder of this ""film"" was. Still, that earned it an extra Star... bringing it to 2/10.Now, every movie has problems. But Fantastic Four takes that idea to a new level, let's name just A FEW: No character has steady motivation. Supposed genius-level intellects that never make a good decision. There are better forums for a potentially world-ending device than a high-school science fair. Don't ""check out"" the glowing cracks of energy without equipment. Or tools. Or while drunk. And certainly don't touch it.Don't initiate 'manual override' for rogue scientists in an unknown danger, on an unknown planet, contaminated with who knows what. Stop ""routing emails through a relay"" while on the run, Reed. WHO ARE YOU EMAILING?!! Why would a ""red-alert"" emergency in a top secret facility inexplicably open all the doors? (Because when something goes wrong here, it's probably just a fire drill.) The limitless, undefined, god-like powers that Dr. Doom has. Dialogue like: ""He is stronger than any of them... Not stronger than all of them."" Good one, Fox. And needlessly choking the hero, just so he can monologue like a good villain. It was a 100-minute trailer for a never-to-be-made sequel.I could go on.

Instead, I found a lot of unfair critiques. Once you let go of your FF preconceptions and accept the retelling of the mythos (and the scientific mumbo-jumbo that's in every science-y movie), it's a pretty decent story. It's not the FF story I wanted, but it works. Certainly it works better than the nightmare the previous 3 movies were (apart from the comic relief of Roger Corman's version and Michael Chiklis' performance as The Thing.)The main problem I saw was that it needed more development, specifically in the 2nd and 3rd acts; it feels cut down to me. I honestly thought it could have been a half-hour longer. If they'd done that, they could have developed the ""body horror"" of transformation, given us more on the development of their powers, developed Doom's character and return, his ""plot"", and the actual ending far more. Overall, however, I was surprisingly entertained. The cast all did admirably. No one suffered from overacting, the characters felt good, the dialogue wasn't stiff (the scientific writing and premises were bad, but you have to expect that), directing is firm. The development was a little lacking here and there, but I think they took advantage of the fact that we all know who these guys are for the most part.Not brilliant, but definitely entertaining.

But it's not good either.Based on the reviews I've seen, I was expecting Fantastic Four to be laughably bad, but most of its flaws are based on what it lacks. The first third of the story actually not bad. The story is paced decently, all of the characters are introduced well, and their personalities are developed nicely as well. The last two acts are where everything pretty much falls apart. The story begins to feel rushed, none of the relationships between the characters are developed enough, the dialogue in many instances sounds cheesy, and the action sequences are pretty boring. It's hard to really care about the characters and their relationships with one another. Due to this, the conflict doesn't quite draw the viewer in enough. And due to the excessively fast pacing of the last two acts, the main conflict is introduced so late in the story that the resolution is way too short and feels extremely anti-climatic. In regards to the other aspects of the movie, they are nothing special either. The acting is fine but nothing impressive, the casting choices are okay but no one really seems to fit their roles completely, and the story isn't too interesting. Overall, Fantastic Four is a tad boring with not many redeeming qualities but it's probably not as bad as many reviews are making it out to be. It's still at least watchable.",Fantastic Four

As soon as Victor came back the entire tone changed and the whole banding together to fight felt forced, unexciting and cheesy.Looking through the reviews here I can see I'm in the minority... but another 30 mins and a slower burner in the third act might have done this the world of good.Missed opportunity full of unfulfilled promise.",Fantastic Four

I did enjoy the story as I never read the comics and have nothing to really sit here and compare it too. (Except for the first attempt at fantastic four on the silver screen). I liked how dark everything was, and it had potential, but was ruined by a cast who you know wanted nothing to do with this film, and a story that was rushed. I loved how Doctor Doom was portrayed, and would have enjoyed much more bad guy vs good guy than an hour plus of back story and a five minute fight scene. One thing that I found to be extremely comical was the invisible woman's hair. Through out the whole movie you had her real hair and then a horrible wig as she was working on another movie at the time of filming Fantastic 4. Marvel has been such a game changer the last few years that it seemed only inevitable that Fox would make something that couldn't even stand up to all the block busters that have been coming out.

I do feel like I'm violated as a person, a critic, and a fan of the Fantastic Four. NOTHING about this film is at all redeemable! NOTHING! And I swear, if one of these idiots try and defend this film and say it's a better movie then the original two FF Movies, I'M GONNA BLOODY SCREAM!The film, for some reason, wanted to go and take the DC route and make the film all dark and gritty and mature. However, the execution that is seen here makes all of the truly 'Dark' and 'Mature' moments seem more generically and laughably childish. The Fantastic Four, whoever you look at it, can't all be 100% dark and gritty. It's what gave the comic and, to some extent, the original FF movie from 2005 it's charm.

Johnny and Sue Storm from the 2005 film, while not really that engaging, was at the very least believable, and no, not for the obvious reason seen here. The film wants us to believe that these two are dynamic brother and sister, and it dose not work. Johnny couldn't be any less charming unless they just end up making him a big villain. Instead of being a reckless, but good-hearted, the 2015 Johnny is now just reckless and stubborn. Oh, and you can tell he almost turns into a bad guy, because he supports the Militry and we all know that the Militry is always evil.Sue, by contrast to her 2005 counterpart, has devolved exponentially from a sort of love interest that had some good qualities to her into just another boring love interest that seems even MORE irritating here than before. Every scene she's in just sucks the life out of the audience, like she's just bored to be in this movie. She even takes the fun out of music, saying it's just a way to find out all the blooming patterns and....oh for hell's sake it's bloody music! Enjoy the bloody music like a bloody human being!Ben Grimm at the very least starts off as one of the lesser bastardized characters. That is until after the Four get their powers, where he then becomes a complete CGI monstrosity with rocks all over his body. Then he becomes the Militry's brutish muscle, and once again if movie teaches you anything it's that Militry is bad and irredeemable in everything. It's almost as if both Ben Grimm, the quirky and smart Junkyard Jew, and The Thing, the big rock covered brute are two completely different characters now. Unlike the 2005 version, love it or hate it, where the character is constant, if one could call it that.If there is one part of the film I feel really divided over, it's on Doctor Doom. Now, Victor Von Doom wasn't represented to his full extent in the 2005 version. However, at the very least he LOOKED and ACTED like Doctor Doom! Here, he's a chubby, video game playing Left Winger against the Militry and Government instead of the all powerful, definitive symbol of Fascism and the powers of evil like he was in the comics. However, it is pretty refreshing to see a Left Wing villain, so I'll give the film that. And he even has a lot of cool scenes devoted to him, showing off all that power he has, and by GOD is this great potential for a recurring villain! That is until they kill him off five minutes later.Yeah, I'm not kidding about that, they LITERALLY kill off Doctor Doom, no less then five minutes after he becomes Doctor Doom. Not only that, but it was done in the most clichéd way possible, with having the four simply combine their unique powers to stop the villain. They axed off one of Marvel's most powerful, most cunning, and most diabolical super villain in the most disrespectful, and most novice way possible. I can't believe I hate a movie like this...well, THIS much. I think the only other movie I hated just as much was Alexander and The Needlessly Long Title. But now, I think that crown has been taken by this horrible excuse for a comic book movie. I hate this film. I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate it! Hate it! I hate that anyone can be dumb enough to find salvageable things and nicer things to say about it. And guess what, the idiots behind this film still want sequels, spin offs even! From THIS! You just axed off one of the Four's well known recurring menace and you want to milk this sickly cow!? I don't usually like cursing on film reviews to an extreme but...F-yay Fantastic Four 2015! The Final Result for this film is an E-RANKING! AN E! A ONE-HALF STAR! This has got to be, compared to the 2005 film and Rise of The Silver Surfer, the WORST Fantastic Four movie I've had the displeasure of seeing! Don't you even THINK about wasting your money on this, Don't you DARE give 20th Century Fox and Josh Trank your hard earned money! Cause if you do, then more CRAP like this can come out both their asses and onto our favorite superhero team!",Fantastic Four
404,alejandrovelez85,Just like I expected,1,6 August 2015,"Terrible film, the only thing worst than the cast was the story.Thankfully I didn't have to pay to watch it since I got invited to the preview.Since this movie was announced and the cast was reveled,thousands of fans were against it, I read at least on 10 different websites hundreds of comments against the cast, going from the teenager look of them, to the race difference on the human torch. The studios should never forget that fans and audiences are the ones who pay for their movies.I really hope the second part is already canceled, but if by any chance the studio decides to go on with it, hopefully people will come to reason and don't waste money on it so this way studios will stop making garbage movies.",Fantastic Four
405,Eshan_2110,A wasted opportunity...,2,7 August 2015,"It's been 8 years since Fantastic Four Rise of The Silver Surfer and Marvel's 'first family' graced our screens.Now with a new direction and armed with a youthful, talented cast as well as a respected director in Josh Trank at the helm, what could possibly go wrong? Well..it turns out almost everything. Don't get me wrong, it would be unfair to not mention that this film has received a lot of negative press (perhaps unfairly) even in pre-production with certain directions the film was taking (such as Johnny Storm's race and Dr Doom's blogger origins). Regardless, as I entered the screening with popcorn in tow and unaware as to what exactly to expect, the film felt as if it had ended before it even started with it's 100 minute run time. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a a film this length, in fact it's quite nice to have a superhero film that doesn't have a run time of 2+ hours. However, with that that mentioned Josh Trank doesn't get to expand on characters and character development. The end result is that you just don't care about these characters. Now onto that cast and quite a promising one at that. Miles Teller who is fresh off his success with the Oscar Winning film Whiplash, leads this ensemble cast as Reed Richards. He is supported by Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm and lastly Michael B Jordan as Sue's brother (how they are brother and sister is addressed and simple to understand) Johnny Storm. I felt that Michael B Jordan faced a lot of unfair criticism due to his casting as Johnny (who in both the comics and previous films is white) as having seen in films such as Josh Trank's very own Chronicle, he has the charisma and charm to pull off Johnny Storm's cocky yet funny attitude. It just raises the question as to why people can't comprehend the idea that maybe choosing the best actor possible for the role is a better choice as opposed to staying in true to comic book origins. There are some parts of the film where you can see the actors looks like they're are having a blast, but this family dynamic that is so prevalent in the comics is entirely missing. In fact, even some characters feel as if they are totally missing and are neglected throughout the majority of the film. Toby Kebbell's Dr Doom is quite one dimensional and it's a shame having recently seen him in Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes in which he stars as they villainous and rebellious Koba. Overall the cast of this calibre just feel wasted. In terms of GCI I wasn't too impressed, and the film quite clearly has a lower budget than most superhero films, which I guess is understandable given Josh Trank's directorial background and Fox wanting to make as much profit as they possibly can. It just doesn't bode too well on the big screen. In fact, I found it quite ironic having just watched an interesting video by Freddie Wong ( Why CG sucks, expect it doesn't- RocketJump Film School) defending how CG can be brilliant and add to film when used right. Except in this situation, Fantastic Four isn't one of those examples. I also felt that the dialogue was weak and cheesy and there is an especially cringe-worthy scene where the team try to figure out their name. The soundtrack scored by Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass is forgettable and bland. The story is basic and predictable, perhaps not as engaging as I was hoping for it to be. As I mentioned, the films run time prevents it from many things. For instance, tackling themes such as identity could well have separated the Fantastic Four from other superhero films but these are just not addressed well. Ultimately, the film lacks character, heart and well even action. The big battle that one is accustomed to in almost every superhero film is short and there is a lack of tension and danger. It's a shame that all of this talent has been wasted.",Fantastic Four
406,nicolailaros,Exactly what Marvel needs to grow up from standard level,10,13 August 2015,"First of all, let me tell you that I was very dubious when I read the IMDb reviews. And 3.9 for ""Fantastic four"" by Josh Trank, what the hack??? I'm not a huge fan of ""Chronicles"", but I (positively) admit that director Josh Trank and screenwriter Max Landis were sometimes able to transcend some overexploited ""super-hero-standards"". The flight sequences (if properly seen in a theater, of course) are breathtaking and the youngsters are remarkably well portrayed with all their strength and weaknesses. Kids. With superpowers. But still kids. And what else is Trank's new film about, so tell me? Or should I rather ask if what we have here is really such a bad adaptation of The Fantastic Four created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby? I didn't go with any particular expectations, but as a former fan of the Marvel comics, I must admit that everything I saw on screen this afternoon is, in my personal opinion, a brilliant comics-adaptation by Josh Trank. Yes, what we have here is another story about kids with superpowers. But still kids who need to learn to control these amazingly powerful skills within a very short lapse of time. Or these skills may be a threat for the whole planet. Just imagine for a sec what they are experiencing... So, c'mon guys, what is going on here? ""Chronicle"" is a hit for most people and ""Fantastic Four"" a stinker? Josh Trank just did it again, this time on a much larger scale. And as you can read it everywhere, it wasn't a piece of cake to make the film: it's not the director's approved version you saw... Can you imagine it? Or have you forgotten who is behind the making of this movie? Then have a closer look: The director gives you a clue each time you see the character of Tim Blake Nelson on screen... Under these production conditions, as a real Marvel ""Secret Wars"" lover(and do you remember what happened to Victor Van Doom out there, on the Beyonder's planet?), I admit having been ultimately well surprised by this dark, respectful, fine written and directed (even if not perfect) super-hero adventure, with a little something more... All the actors and SFX are in my point of view brilliant. Lovers of the Dark Knight Trilogy and Christopher Nolan's more realistic Gotham world may be delightfully astonished. Just give the damn movie a chance. At least, Josh Trank and Matthew Vaughn deserve it, with or without Stan Lee's special appearance!",Fantastic Four
407,jrugg19,I don't get the hate...,5,7 August 2015,"Let me start off by saying that this is NOT a perfect film. It is very far from that, but to call it an awful film? I have to disagree. The major problem with the movie was that it takes WAY too long to build up the characters, and then when they finally get their powers, the movies rushes and then suddenly ends. But it's not like the first half isn't at least interesting. Director Josh Trank attempts to restore the Marvel comic in his second film after his successful debut of Chronicle.The story is a pretty good origin story that got way more devoted time then it should have. I did enjoy it for the most part, but it could have been cut down a little bit in favor of more action from the Fantastic Four. One thing I really enjoyed was that even though it was a Marvel movie, it had a dark feel to it. It tried to act like a DC movie instead of Marvel, which was a fresh surprise considering that all Marvel movies are starting to all feel like the same light humor action festival. The cast consists of big up-and-comers Miles Teller (playing Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic) and Michael B. Jordan (playing Johnny Storm/Human Torch), the somewhat established Kate Mara, (playing Sue Storm/Invisible Woman) and the relatively unknown Jamie Bell. (Playing Ben Grimm/The Thing). Miles Teller keeps the story together and I feel like he plays a very good Reed Richards but a cheesy Mr. Fantastic, but that is the script he had to work with for the second half. Michael B. Jordan is the most impressive, but he got the least amount of screen time out of the four. Toby Kebbell (playing Victor Von Doom/ Dr. Doom) is also decent but he disappears in the beginning and then comes back when they're is about 20 minutes left. I feel like Dr. Doom definitely should have been used more but you will remember his scenes. The special effects were impressive, and making The Thing created by CGI worked well. I just wish they gave him some pants, along with Doom. You can tell about 80% of the budget went towards the climax alone. Speaking of the climax, it was kind of fun to watch but it was so rushed, and left me wanting more. Overall, it did have a decent amount of flaws, but I enjoyed it overall. The origin story was pretty interesting, the acting was good enough for the cheesy script they had to work with, and the action scenes were fun for what they were. It was far from The Dark Knight, but it is nowhere near Batman & Robin.7/10",Fantastic Four
408,apoe-1,"10942 = 29,4% voted 1",8,23 August 2015,"Let me say this. IMDb should do something about this. Almost 30% voted 1 out of 10. That's absolute not realistic. The movie was in my opinion good from begin to end. All the aspects of a s.f. comic movie are there and the way it evolved during the movie was outstanding. I loved the dark parts but if you see it in a bad movie theater it can be boring when not the right equipment is used. But most ""comic"" lovers are far from realistic and live in their own small world without an open mind for all the goods beside the lesser goods. Especially the alternate world was done perfect and with a sense of humor that was more than welcome. The special effects are just okay ... But I end as I started.

410,TerrificTom,Screw the Reviewers! It's a STORY!,6,8 August 2015,"I almost didn't see this movie in the theater because of the bad reviews. I found it hard to believe it could be worst than the first two! But I saw it this Thursday at Sam Town Century Theaters and i ENJOYED it!Perhaps it helped that my expectations were so low based on the reviews. and I am NOT saying it couldn't have been better. But as movies go it was an entertaining STORY.TINY SPOILER ALERT!What I wished they'd done is made the movie longer and spent more time on the character and relationship development between Reed and Ben. I liked the fact that Ben lacked onto Reed early and was with him up through high school. That was interesting but nothing of that was developed but it could have been through short vignettes of the boys growing up together. It would have been great. Ben beating up the bullies picking on Reed. Reed tutoring Ben in math and science. Ben helping Reed get his first date. Reed using technology to help Ben get revenge on his big brother. See! Stories. THEN, when Reed goes off the college, Ben could give him the Swiss Army knife and thank him for helping him get into another college and that because of Reed he was going to be a pilot (which Ben was in the original comic). That way, when Reed calls Ben and tells him he wants him to go with him it wouldn't look like some kind of pity payback. We would know Ben was at least capable of being a pilot, etc.The story hung on Reed and Ben's relationship and that should have been developed more. They had plenty of time to do it. As it was, when Ben turns into the Thing and Reed runs off, etc., it would have been much more powerful. and their reconciliation have been more touchingI could talk forever about the terrible storytelling in every sci-fi movie made since JJ Abrams began sh**ing our stories and raping television legends, but I wouldn't be able to stop. And this movie suffers from those same kinds of defects. But it was still an entertaining story. See it, if you like to go to the movies. Wait for it to stream otherwise.",Fantastic Four
411,Supes909,Not worth the admission price,2,9 August 2015,If your a Marvel fan as I am you will be thoroughly be disappointed by this total failure at a reboot of the Fantastic 4.Boring drawn out with a slight after thought of action at the end! Stan Lee how the heck did this butchery of the original comic Fantastic 4 get past you?? The story was weak and completely unlike How you guys at Marvel wrote and illustrated it originally. Dr. Doom (when he finally became Dr. Doom) came and went out in less that 20 minutes.The first two were much better and truer to the original comics.

This movie wants to be a biopic simply to leave room for yet more sequels, however, I don't think the producers will move forward.Only because more is required to post...I will say that the movie attempts to prop up individuals with real problems such as broken homes and dysfunctional relationships. The movie does not surprise in any way because it is so predictable. A bunch of geniuses and outcast have a great idea and the DOD wants to take it over. How original!",Fantastic Four
413,eesainio,"Yours truly went to take a look at this of five-minute whim and boredom, still positively surprised!",7,2 February 2016,"Fantastic Four has had in my opinion a surprising amount of criticism both from viewers and critics. And it also produced badly at the box office. IMDb average stands week as of 4,3 and Rotten tomatoes percentage is 9. Well, I have to admit that Yours truly went to take a look at this of five-minute whim and boredom. But at the end I was positively surprised.The film begins with the discovery of Reed Richards's (Miles Teller), youth and telecommunications visor device which the whole movie rotates. When Richards meets Ben Grimm (the role of a surprising choice, Jamie Bell), they begin to develop this invention. Some years later, they presented to the school science fair. They get Franklin Storm (Reg.E.Cathey) and his daughter Susan (no surprises Kate Mara) attention. And that's how the half-drama, half-superhero flick begins!It's the actors in this movie, that save this film from the self- loath and eating out of paper plates. Miles Teller, Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan are brilliant in their roles third of the Fantastic Four. Kate Mara gets a little overshadowed by the dudes but yes, he also performs quite well. Previously unknown to me Reg E.Cathey also has a great role as the dad of Susan and Johnny Storm. And that's all I have to say about that. I mean- wait. Did you know that: 1. This film went through the hard way when it was made. 2. All of the very small role actors have only played at modern 7/10 drama-adventure movies. 3. I like this film, although it's like a recipe of how you make bad movies 4. It has caused controversy only of it's director's complains. 5. IMDb's forum only talk about this film like this: wonder at the choice to make Johnny Storm dark-skinned, wondering about it's average grade and asking do people get killed, because children want to see this.As I have already said many times like this (forgive me if I repeat myself), this film wasn't all that bad. The only stuff that is wrong with it is mild weakness in the plot and kinda bad CGI effects. Previously mentioned, the actors do a good job, especially the shining Miles Teller at the neurotic Richards role.",Fantastic Four
414,CampoReviews,"To Fantastic Four, Or Not To Fantastic Four that is question",5,11 August 2015,"In my honest opinion this movies was better the the last two incarnations of the Fantastic Four, was it a great movie? absolutely not. Was it as bad of a movie as critics have been saying? No but it was pretty meh 4.5 out of 10 for me. Despite all the bad reviews on this movie, i have to admit throughout this film it had great potential to be one of the better Marvel films but just kept falling short time after time. Miles Teller was really good in this movie as well as Kate Mara but the rest of the cast which on paper should have been amazing fell very short, i really didn't like Michael B Jordon who missed all his moments, but by far the worst performance even worse the the terrible acting of Tim Blake Nelson was.... Reg E. Cathey who plays Dr.Franklin Storm the father Sue And Johnny he had way to much screen time in which i felt he was just reading off a piece of paper he was holding. Had Samuel L. Jackson not been already signed by Marvel i would have said he would be perfect for this role as well as maybe Morgan Freeman. The Graphics in this movie are cheap i don't understand why, despite that i really like how the Thing looked and i liked the really the how true it was to the Ultimate Fantastic Four comic. I feel a lot of critics don't read comics to see how they almost page for page drawing for drawing used the comic to make this movie which gave it a plus in my book its probably one of the truest to the comic superhero movies we have seen so far, and i personally don't like the Fantastic Four what so ever. I went into this movie with no expectations at all just hoping for something better then the last two and i almost got that, i guess. I did like the dark tone of the movie that was different, but i hate how it doesn't connect with the X-Men/Deadpool universe. I left my chair with two good thoughts after this movie. 1. They laid the ground for a potentially great sequel from seeing what this movie could have been and wasn't to the way they set up for the sequel, even though it probably wont happen. 2. I really like the realistic tone and science behind the whole thing in conclusion this movie suffered from forced acting, un-spontaneous scenes which seemed also forced (eg. when they find Reed Richards at a science fair for a high school in the middle of no where just by chance because two scientist happen to be there looking for the answer to inter dimensional travel.... are you kidding me, god fox try harder), slow pacing and little to no action at all with a lack luster 3rd act. All of this because of being rushed to make a movie just to keep the rights (see Jurassic World, Terminator Genisys, Punisher, Ghost Rider, A Good Day To Die Hard) i just felt like no one cared except Kate Mara and Miles Teller, Josh Trank had a vision which he wasn't allowed to execute due to rich old men who don't know what we as fans want I'm honestly getting tired of Hollywood bull s***. All of the credit i give to this movies is based on small moments of greatness and potential of what could have been. At Least Its Watchable unlike some other comic movies. if your a superhero movie fan i say this is a must watch at least once and would compare it to Green Lantern. watchable but nothing great.",Fantastic Four

418,bennington13,Extra Ordinary,5,9 August 2015,"Extra OrdinaryJumping on to the reboot bandwagon, 2015′s Fantastic Four wipes the slate clean of 2005′s harmless puff piece starring Jessica Alba and Chris Evans as it (re)tells the tale of a group of scientists transformed into superheroes after an experiment goes catastrophically awry. At the time, both the 2005 film and its no less silly sequel (Rise of the Silver Surfer) were widely derided. So imagine what it would take to make those look like masterclasses in superhero storytelling. Answer? Fox's latest addition to its muddled back catalogue of Marvel movies. To be fair, F4 starts promisingly. Notwithstanding the predictable outpouring of rage that greeted news that the new quartet would be young, restless and (gasp!) not all white, the casting was bold enough to pique interest. Michael B. Jordan's natural charisma seemed a lock for the swaggering Johnny Storm/Human Torch, while Miles Teller's intense turns in movies like Whiplash signalled an interesting interpretation of obsessive scientist Reed Richards. In a world where you're a failure if you're not a tech billionaire by the time you're 30, it's hardly inconceivable that a motley crew of barely post-pubescent prodigies would be at the vanguard of a once-in-a-generation breakthrough. And it's not a massive leap to think that it would take a young, reckless (and mildly inebriated) group of kids to precipitate the ill-fated mission that forever alters their lives. Throw in Josh Trank (whose freshman effort was 2012′s excellent found footage superhero movie Chronicle) and colour me intrigued. And for a while, it works well.The reboot at its best when its rag tag braniacs are doing their science thing. Sadly, that is a staggeringly low benchmark for a contemporary comic book movie. Despite its length, none of the characters are given room enough to breathe. Fitful attempts at backstory and characterisation all peter out into loose ends rather than being woven into a richer tapestry - Ben Grimm's (Jamie Bell) unlikely friendship with Richards, the weaponisation of The Thing for special ops, the Storm family dynamic - all are picked up and then inexplicably cast aside, seemingly at random. So by the time the faecal matter hits the fan, no wonder it's difficult to care about what happens to anyone on screen (with the possible exception of Reg Cathey's mellifluous patriarch Franklin Storm). But it's the action setpieces that are weakest, Trank's inexperience with big budget pageantry thrown into stark relief by shoddy pacing and anti-climactic showdowns. The portrayal of the fab four's powers is cringeworthy, with lousy physical acting (particularly from Teller and Kate Mara), but the real shocker is a Dr Doom (Toby Kebbell) lumbered with an incarnation even worse than that sported by Patrick McMahon in 2005). It doesn't help that key narrative sequences are also missing - there's no 'learning to use my powers' montage, nor any trial and error adventures as they start to work as a team. In fact, they're kept apart for much of the time until Doom bursts violently - and incongruously - into the movie for reasons that remain at best, inexplicable. By the time F4 slouches towards the finish line, it feels as though the film-makers just want to get to the end as quickly as possible.Which is a real shame. This was clever casting with a bittersweet, reality based grittiness that promised to leaven DC's despondency with some of Marvel's trademark wit. Had Fox invested in a stronger crew with more blockbuster experience (a quick check on IMDb reveals cinematography and second units which are woefully under equipped for this sort of venture) it might have at least delivered on spectacle. Alas, this is a poorly executed adaptation and judging by the critical and box office opprobrium, it's unlikely they'll get another chance to prove themselves - if only Fox would learn their lesson and just hand back the reigns to Marvel.",Fantastic Four

422,Zeta-One,The Fantastically Boring Four,2,8 August 2015,"Honestly, this is one of the worst superhero movies I've seen.After Tim Story's Fantastic Four films, I was pretty glad that Fox had decided to reboot the Fantastic Four and start anew. I thought that maybe, Fox might get things right and finally make the Fantastic Four movie we've all been waiting for.Instead, Fox has given us a film with no meaning and no character development. The film starts off with Reed Richards as a kid, who is trying to invent a teleporter. Ben Grimm eventually helps him, and the two become best friends. A few years later, Reed and Ben try the experiment again at the science fair, which attracts the attention of Dr. Franklin Storm from the Baxter Building. Dr. Storm offers Reed a full scholarship to work at the Baxter Building, where Reed meets Victor Von Doom, Johnny Storm, and Susan Storm. Together, they build a larger version of a teleporter, and enter a new dimension. There, they all get their powers.To start off, the film has a solid cast (Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Jamie Bell). Acting was OK to good. The only bad thing was that they didn't seem to fit in their roles.However, despite the cast, the film had little to no backstory for any of the characters. Besides Reed and Ben, we have no idea who the characters were like in the past, their childhood, etc.After Susan, Johnny, Reed, and Ben get their powers, the film starts becoming boring. In fact, once the government becomes interested in the Four, the film goes on a dark and dull path. There is absolutely no meaning to the plot. The government takes interest in the dimension (now known as Planet Zero) that the Four have visited, and forces Dr. Storm and Reed to build a new, advanced teleporter to help their military get there.Once the military reaches the dimension, they find Victor Von Doom, who was thought to be dead. With no reason whatsoever, Doom takes on a dark path and wants to destroy Earth and create his own world in Planet Zero.Just when things could get interesting, the film continues being dull. The fight between Doom and the Four was incredibly boring and predictable. Doom, who is one of the most powerful beings in the comics, is made to look like a weird machine with weak powers. The Four was also made to look weak against Doom, when their powers can do much more in the comics. The only good thing about the final fight in the film was the CGI, which was not impressive, but okay.Overall, this film was fantastically boring. The end was cheesy, and the film is highly predictable and dark. Out of the many superhero titles, this is perhaps one of the worst films out there. Even if you are curious or want to see how bad it is, you are better off skipping this film and saving your money.",Fantastic Four
423,sanjayvjr,":fantastic four has a good cast, but uses them to fly into a useless teaser.",1,29 November 2015,"FANTASTIC FOUR-REVIEW (2015)Cast: Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, Jamie BellDirector: Josh TrankRelease Date: August 7, 2015Produced by:Marvel EntertainmentMPAA Rating:PG-13One of this years most anticipated movies is finally out, and it looks like it's going to flame out very soon. Fantastic Four is directed by Josh Trank, director of the ""Chronicle"" and others. Even though Fantastic Four boasts a new cast including Academy Award nominated Miles Teller, nothing really seems to work in the movie. This movie has no plot and a honest throwback of a story. The lack of characterization, story, and acting is what really kills the movie. The result is this crazy, stupid, and muddled feeling of a movie. To be short, this movie feels like a teaser to something big, to something that never happens. Noting that this the FOURTH attempt at making a good Fantastic Four movie and also keeping a talented cast, this movie still doesn't click with the franchise. Fan4tastic is trying to do a lot, but ends up doing nothing. After the hype for over 2 years, Marvel still can't make a decent Fantastic movie that keeps up. There is in fact no story in the film, though it is a graphic pleaser. This movie could have ended in many ways and could have progressed in many ways, but instead Fantastic Four goes in the direction the whole franchise went. The only real fight or action in this movie is placed in the last ten minutes. Plot-holes big enough that the ""Thing"" can leap right through. There is no need for a screenplay in this movie since it has a lame convoluted plot. It progresses just like every other brainless movie. Obviously not learning anything from the other Horrible F Four movies, the movie still never progresses. This trailer lasts for around one and half hours and it really stinks. The story isn't put together properly and there's no real knitting. Now, the performances were just OK, Miles Teller was really the best thing that ever happens to the movie (At least that). You could rather put coffee shop music for this rather than action. Honestly, even Miles Teller's comedy doesn't work here. There is no real aim in this movie noting that the villain only shows up in the last fifteen minutes. Many questions still need to be answered. Not development questions, but questions about the shamed plot-holes. The last battle last for TEN whole minutes. Really? Maybe I agree for the Avengers, but for four young kids who want lose their powers throughout the whole movie?!!To those F4 fans, this movie is the most muddled and mired movie in the whole series. It is the worst Marvel movie ever made and god forbid there be another sequel. Ultimately, this movie gave me the thought to watch the other F4 movies, the one where they did Dr. Doom much better. Fantastic Four set out to be a really great franchise, but nothing ever worked for it. This series has always sucked and I think it's about time they let it die, like they should for ""Paranormal Activity"" . If you are going to watch this movie, buy some extra popcorn so you have something to focus on while watching this one and half-hour dumb snooze fest.

424,lbishopkyo,"So bad it's good, must be given a second chance!",9,19 March 2016,"I love this movie. I really do. Yes, it's bad. I see that it's bad. But to me, it's so bad it's good. I didn't expect to love it the way I do today, but I do love it so much.Now, I remember the trailer made it look like it was going to be serious, but the movie was just flat out hilarious. The characters acted like socially awkward weirdos you'd see in a Roland Emmerich or Jeff Goldblum movie. It's so poorly acted I just laughed a lot during this movie. Miles Teller, however, is a pretty good actor, I will say.Also, I know they change things up by having Reed Richards, Johnny Storm, Ben Grimm, and Victor von Doom go to Space without Sue Richards, which is very different, but I didn't really care; at least Sue Richards still became part of the team anyway! Plus, taking von Doom up there and leaving him behind makes his motivation for being the bad guy good, no? I will also give this movie credit for not being kid-friendly and having the money be mostly spent on childish jokes that only 6-year-olds would find funny.Speaking of Dr. Doom, I think he makes for a very good intimidating villain. He looked different, yes, but in his defense, he is so intimidating, it almost makes you wonder how the Fantastic Four, or anybody for that matter, could possibly defeat him. He's basically an evil Lucy (2014).So overall, Fantastic Four is really not that bad. It's not a good movie, but it's worth viewing just to see how silly and poorly acted it is. To sum it up, it's bad acting, but superb action and good atmosphere/detail. Let's hope the sequel can be twice as cheesy.",Fantastic Four
425,omnimog,Disappointing,3,25 October 2015,"Let me just start off by stating that I had absolute no problems with the initial premises of neither the cast, nor the interpretation for this movie. I love my Marvel-movies and comics. But F4 are originally from a different age, and I can very well understand how any filmmaker would find it difficult to translate the source material to the big screen in 2015. So, I kept an open mind. And no matter how much hate this movie got during production, I still was looking forward to make up my own opinion on it. Too bad it failed on all levels. The cast is actually very good. So is the director, at least I thought he did a marvelous job on Chronicle. But they all fail miserably here. I cannot evenbegin to wrap my head around how such a talented cast are seemingly so incredibly uninspired. The direction is flat and boring, everything feels extremely one-dimensional and uninspired. Editing was bad, music didn't fit well, script and antagonists were shallow and felt rushed, and even the sound effects, costumes, make-up, and every other single element of this movie failed. How this is possible with such a budget and so much talent is to me, again, an huge mystery. I didn't actually believe that I'd see any superhero movie as bad as the original two F4s again. And, of course, the insanely botched Ghost Rider movies. But this one is right down there with them, if not worse.",Fantastic Four
426,BoxOfficeKid,90 minute long intro with a dash of conclusion! A tampered final cut!,5,8 January 2016,"The movie in a nutshell: It has a promising start, but is without a main part and with just one quarter of an ending. With all its flaws, it is actually not as bad as what the critics says, heck, I'll say a movie without a main part is better than the Fantastic Four from 2005.The movie gave me the same feeling as when I suffered a mean case of food poisoning during the screening of Terminator Salvation and had to run to the toilet, missing out on some important sections of the movie. I felt the same way here (without the food poisoning),like somebody took out major parts of the movie and I just got to see a too long intro, a very short Victor von Doom arc and a very abrupt and quick conclusion the last 15 minutes of the movie. Actually I found the prolonged intro very intriguing. The character and story build-up was actually interesting. The post-accident and ensuing hardships was... kinda interesting, although not thoroughly fleshed out, still interesting. Trask did something bold here (other than making the Human Torch black), it did not have the formula Marvel feel over it. Fantastic Four felt somewhat invested in telling something new. When Doom appears on screen and retaliates, it is actually menacing, although only for a short moment. I am not defending Trank, but there was something there.All in all, somebody tampered with the movie, whether it was Trank's fault in not following through with the movie, studio intervention or revisions far too late, it is hard to tell. But somebody sabotaged this movie beyond saving.",Fantastic Four
427,shanitajohn,Not sure what I'm missing.,7,31 May 2019,"I guess if you have no history with this franchise, you will find this to be an average, but totally enjoyable superhero movie. I did. However, if this franchise is the only thing you have to live for, this film will, apparently, ruin your life. Seek solidarity in the mouth-foamy, red-faced, vein-poppy 1-star reviews. It's kind of amusing.For everyone else, though, the movie is fine. It's okay. Get some snacks, zone out for a bit. It's not that deep.",Fantastic Four
428,RedfordJack,It's a decent idea,6,14 October 2020,"I think the problem is that they started with it being about the 2 friends.That completely was lost. It's basically a waste of 30 minutes.It doesn't play into the movie much at all, except as a ploy. I was already skeptical of the friendship at the junk yard. But it could have been done with good writing.And if it had been, then please introduce the antagonist at this point. You would have a triad, and it would work. And it would make more sense and tension in the movie.From the notes I read, the movie was much longer initially, so maybe Trask incorporated what I'm suggesting -- I doubt it.It's okay for 5th grade.",Fantastic Four

430,hidariryuI,If you are a FF fan you will love it. Don't take it out on Trank because of Fox,8,8 August 2015,"This movie was what one would expect for the FF if they were to be brought from the comic pages to the big screen.First, lets start with the fact that like all origin stories, the tale must be told from a point of view that not everyone will be familiar with the characters.Second, the characters have to be fleshed out in a few scenes before we get to the action and more so with characters of this variety that have fantastic powers (pun unintended), the idea that you can fit so much history in a short time is unexpected. Josh Trank, you did a bang up job.I realize that most people went in with the idea of the previous FF movies but lets be real. Those were camp. These characters all play a pivotal role in the Marvel Universe and if I were the Fox I would use this as a spring board for more use to keep the fans coming back for more. If this was a bad superhero movie then I shudder to think what people think is the best. I give it an 8 out of 10. It needed more work but we won't see it because they have probably already canned any sequels.",Fantastic Four

432,CoffeeLatteWriter,A Major Disappointment,3,16 August 2015,"The film definitely lives up to the horrible comments and anticipation of how much it would bomb. I figured there was no way it could be that bad, and that everyone was just hating on the film for the sake of it. But I was wrong. When I thought the film couldn't screw up any further, it did just that.There are too many reasons to list why this film did so horribly -- one of which being the unnecessarily long beginning which took twenty minutes too long to reach the actual point in the film that we all knew was coming.Another thing was how they ""killed off"" the villain (which we all knew would survive), and not bringing him back until the last twenty minutes of the film. The leading fight was a huge disappointment that ended much too quickly.This was definitely a major disappointment, and I found myself finding the last two Fantastic Four films (which were bombs as well) much more enjoyable than this film. I wouldn't recommend anyone watch it, and hopefully Fox comes to their senses and decides to return the rights back to Marvel.",Fantastic Four
433,msr-22559,A Misunderstood Movie,7,6 March 2019,"I passed on Fantastic Four at cinema's due to the negative reviews upon it's release in 2015. I've recently watched it on TV even though I was sceptical, and I honestly can't figure out why there are so many negative reviews from critics and the general public, especially the 1 star reviews which is ridiculous and narrow minded.Do I think this is one of the best Marvel movies? No I don't, but then I don't interpret this film as a typical superhero movie and neither should you. Instead, this film should be interpreted as a crossover between a Marvel production and a standalone Sci-fi movie which focuses on the concept of inter-dimensional travel, not just the fight between good and evil.I would've awarded it with 8 stars if the showdown with Victor Von Doom near the end had more detail instead of feeling rather rushed. However, I certainly feel that Fantastic Four is worthy of 7 stars and I suggest for people who like Sci-fi Movies to watch this with an open mind and ignore the low ratings.",Fantastic Four

435,andrewsephiroth,I just don't know what to say.,3,13 August 2015,"So I am know between my friends for being the guy who watch almost every movie and enjoy them even the bad ones, and that happens because when I go to see a movie I just expect to see one thing the movie is promising to give me. For example I enjoyed battle L.A they had an alien invasion like they said, and a lot of battle so I got what I wanted. I enjoyed pixels, because I wanted to see giant video games, and I got that to. Same goes for Battleship, San Andreas and other movies.But this movie I couldn't enjoy it, really, this movie is as bad as Left Behind 2014, and that was one of the few movies I considered bad. I went to see a super hero movie, no there is no super hero movie in here, so what about a SCI FI movie? Begins fine fails hard after first 20 minutes? What about a great villain to give us some hype? No scene with him is over in less than 10 minutes! What can you expect from this movie? Nothing, really no matter what you like this movie fails to give you anything.I will give a 3, just because the very beginning of the movie was enjoyable, and thats it.3/10 (but I really should give it 1).",Fantastic Four

Instead it's some awful movie about a group of super intelligent multicultural teenage orphans who travel to another dimension. Later these teen orphans battle against their friend after he becomes an emo who wants to blow up the earth. If that sounds vaguely interesting, its not. I fell asleep 5 times while watching it!The people involved in making this movie f***** up.

The parts I like was the end battle between the 4 and Dr. Doom, the special effects are decent, but apart from that, this is a very average movie. But the fades to black transitions made the pace slower. Even though the Fantastc Four does appear in the movie, it's not until 2/3 in, you have to deal with the back story of Reed and Ben and yes that was one of my favourite moments about the movie, are the character's interactions. The only character I liked was Victor Von Doom, but oh god, the movie was just not good, but it wasn't bad either, there was some good effects and a pretty decent plot, but come on! the campy original is still the better one. If you are a Marvel fan, then watch this movie with caution Sorry it didn't make much sense, but this is one of the worst remakes out there",Fantastic Four

It's poor reviews are completely justified and I would strongly advise giving this film a wide berth. As far as origin movies go this would be the worst. There are barely any high points, in this show to keep viewers interested. I would advise not blinking during the final moments of this film as you would miss what is suppose to be the final battle between the four protagonists and antagonist. It's as if they were making a movie and realized they had run out of money. Not only are the final parts of the film cringe worthy but the dialouge that accompanies Are just as horrid. There are no redeeming factors for this movie and I'm sure that it will go down as one of the big flops of 2015.",Fantastic Four
439,colincec,Fantastic Four (2015) - A Reel Snippet Review,1,10 August 2015,"Fantastic Four (2015) was an absolutely joyless experience that was just unpleasant to watch. In fact, unpleasant is the perfect word to sum up the movie. The characters act unpleasant, the visuals look unpleasant, and the story feels unpleasant. The CGI breaks the pattern by being jawdroppingly awful. It all looks fake and unconvincing, even in strange places where there doesn't need to be any CG. One scene jumps to mind involving a monkey; they could have used a real one and nothing would have changed, but instead they blew some of their CGI budget on an obviously fake creature that looked like it belonged in Planet of the Apes. In fact, it kind of looked like Caeser from Planet of the Apes. Maybe he really needed a paycheck before the next sequel.What baffles me about the whole production is how the studio followed the same beats and made the same mistakes as their 2005 film, yet somehow made it all worse. The team not actually fighting crime until the last third of the movie? Doom's out of nowhere attraction to Sue? Ben going from Reed's best friend to his mortal enemy in a fight? Check to all of them, but somehow with infinitely less heart and effort. The Storm family doesn't even feel like a family, they just talk to each other like acquaintances in a classroom. Say what you will about Jessica Alba as an actor, but her Sue Storm never sounded like she was sleep talking through her lines like this one does. It gets extremely baffling just how little the makers care as the movie goes on. Apart from Doctor Doom being turned into a total loser without the slightest bit of gravitas, he has a one-hit-kill power that he demolishes an entire building staff with and doesn't even think to whip it out during the final fight. And Ben Grimm being deployed by the government for covert ops? The man is a 200-ton orange rock giant. There is no universe where any of that qualifies as covert apart from this half-baked one I just watched.It's not even a so-bad-it's-good kind of movie, just a really draining experience that put a damper on the whole evening. It didn't even leave me with enough energy to muster any hate towards it. Simply put, nobody cared. The filmmakers didn't care. The actors didn't care. The effects team didn't care. The audience didn't care. As such, I didn't care.",Fantastic Four
440,ewf1000,An enjoyable superhero movie,9,9 August 2015,"I'm going to have to swim against the tide of negative reviews. I was completely entertained by this movie, enjoying it just as much as I did The Avengers, Thor, and Captain America: the Winter Soldier. There were funny moments where I, and the audience with me, laughed out loud. I was invested in the characters and understood what motivated each of them. I had no problem following the plot, and had no problem with the pacing.I'm s die-hard fan of the original FF series as created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Yes, I wanted Sue, Reed, Ben, and Johnny to fly into space and be exposed to cosmic rays, but I accepted their gaining powers through inter-dimensional travel. Yes, I would have preferred casting Reed Richards as a middle-aged, brilliant, respected scientist, but at least the young Reed in this movie is a better depiction than the nerdy, incompetent goof-ball presented in the Tim Story versions. I liked that Sue made better use of her powers here than in the previous versions, I liked this depiction of Doom more than the Tim Story version, I loved the depiction of the Thing, and while I would have preferred Johnny as the teen-aged white guy Stan Lee and Jack Kirby gave us, I very much enjoyed Michael B. Jordan in the role. The actors did a great job here.I do wish the movie had been maybe 15 minutes longer, both to give us more of the battle between Doom and the FF and to give us more interplay between Sue, Johnny, Ben and Reed. But the battle scenes we get here are as exciting as those in any other superhero movie, and I walked out of the theater feeling satisfied. This is an origin story, and it does exactly what an origin story should do: set the stage for future stories. And while it may be unlikely given the drubbing this movie has taken, I would like to see a sequel with this version of these characters.",Fantastic Four

Surely the point of rebooting a franchise is to make it better? Well if anything they made it worse. The cast are awful, the writing is terrible and there is absolutely NO THING laudable to say about this sham of a movie. You want it to get going, it never does, and then it ends. Oh my word, the film was so stultifying that just watching it has made me lose my ability to fully convey in words how bad it was. I feel like I may have actually lost brain cells. If you are thinking perhaps its an okay 'popcorn' movie and that maybe my terrible review has lowered your expectations so much that you may go on to enjoy it...

I took warnings on the previous from my friends but when I saw the trailer for this film I decided I had to see it. What the trailer refuses to mention in that the 2.5-3 min trailer is about all there is worth watching.It starts off like a lot of good superhero flicks, the origins of the heroes. It starts off good but at a certain point, you would like to see the actual heroes in a hero movie. Instead you probably get about 85% of the way through before they even get their ""powers"" let alone start to use them.Past this there is so much more bad throughout this film, not the least of which is the acting, fight scenes, special effects or script, basically any part of movie making was butchered in this film.

The movie could have been better if the fight between the thing and Mr fantastic was longer. The visuals was great and I honestly blame the build up to an anticlimactic ending.honestly I would suggest people go out to watch it because if they get enough money they Will improve on what was wrong with this movie.

I really liked Fantastic Four and sequel rise of the silver surfer but this one is like just to make me remember of those and not something any better. This is like a very low budget reboot. I guess this what happens when you let the kids messed up whats was already getting better. The movie is almost very empty for action and more tell tale story telling. Short summary is just created the teleporter device to another dimension, they went there got their powers, went back again, stop doom(very simple & short) and the end. Thats it. Sigh....

Is there anything really wrong about a silly Sci-Fi movie? If it gives a lot of people employment, makes money for investors and provides a fun time at the movies, what's the big deal? This movie is certainly not an epic by a famous and legendary movie maker, but it is a fast paced, exciting and fun film to watch. Can four nerdy twenty-somethings create a matter/dimensional transfer invention and keep it out of the clutches of the evil military? And along the way keep us all from being devoured by a pesky black hole? Many opportunities for comic relief and sarcasm were missed and could have kicked the hollow plot along. The dimensional transfer machine constructed in a top secret location is a four-holer version of Woody Allen's Orgasmatron in ""Sleeper"" (1976), complete with Reed's horn rim glasses on inside his helmet. In any event, this time dimension road trip is brisk and carried by really cool animations and special effects. There is a brief nod in the library scene to Jules Verne's 1870 ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas."" Bust out a copy of this book and read something by the master. But in this film, the emphasis is on the ""fi"" and not the ""sci"" of SciFi. Any reference to science came from a dictionary because the fancy scientific language used of moving mass through dimensional changes is nonsense and requires a little more thought on how to jump start E = mc2.

Especially when I saw who they cast as lead. I can't say for sure if my assessment of Miles Teller is entirely fair, given that he's type cast into the Divergent series role of a brooding self serving arrogant prick, but as I watch this movie, I can't help but see him in the same way. He lacks the charismatic nerdy charm you expect from Dr. Reed, the roll is just a failure all around. Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm, also did not work. Jamie Bell does pretty good as The Thing, and Kate Mara was decent as Sue. But the overall bottom line, they all come off as way too young to be ""brilliant scientists"". But even if you can look past the casting issues, the plot development was poor, the acting at times was so forced, huge holes in the plot, the only reason I give it 2 stars was for the decent CGI, I thought they did a good job with the special effects, but it's not nearly enough to make this watchable.

Doctor Who fans are in for a treat, as this has all the ingredients that have made all the recent Doctors a hit with the fans; humour, adventure, bonkers science fiction, a leading lady, and an evil nemesis. Okay, Doctor Who is primarily aimed at older children and young teens, with a niche adult fan-base as well. However, the fans of that series know what to expect and as such have rated it 8.8 on IMDb. In that regard, given this movie has most of the same ingredients, perhaps if it were put into a similar genre and fan-base as Doctor Who then this movie would not suffer from the harsh reviews it has.I enjoyed the film, as I had not expectations and definitely found it entertaining. Would I go and see it in the cinema? No, I wouldn't waste my money; but then I would only watch Doctor Who on the TV if there was nothing else to watch. The point here being, know what to expect and you'll be pleasantly surprised and entertained. The current rating, at time of writing, is 4.8/10 which seems a bit unfair.Also you get to see Kate Mara in a latex suit, which may or may not be your thing - but lets look for positives here lol!",Fantastic Four

I saw it with my expectations lowered by the reviews here (for me expectations are absolutely crucial to appreciating a movie at it's best possible consideration).The thing is, and I'm HIGHLY CRITICAL of Sci-Fi (I just love it) this movie didn't bother me at all. It's comic book stuff and I suspend critical judgment for that (or I use different judgment rules).The thing is, I enjoyed myself.

454,kvalentine926-189-516307,Diasppointing waste of opportunity,1,16 August 2015,"I write not to add to the well deserved chorus of negative comments to the Fantastic Four movie but to express my profound disappointment to the producers and director of this movie. I am a longtime fan of the Fantastic Four and had been somewhat disappointed by the 2005 and 2007 F.F movies directed by Tim Story and forgot about the unreleased 1994 version of the movie. The 2015 version of the F.F. movie repeated the same critical mistake of the 2005 movie of saving most of the action to the end of the movie. Where as the 2005 movie had comedic undertones, the 2015 movie had a slowly developing serious undertone that was very boring. I had enjoyed the previous movie ""Chronicle"" that the director had previously directed but the director was way out of his depth with this movie. I was disappointed with all of the actors in this movie; Miles Teller was underwhelming as the genius Reed Richards, Jamie Bell was unimpressive as the strong man Ben Grimm and both Kata Mara and Michael B. Jourdan were undeveloped as Sue and Johnny Storm. I had hope having Michael B. Jourdan playing as Johnny Storm would have been a nice touch to the movie but unfortunately, even if Chris Evan had been re-casted as Johnny Storm, the director would still have not had the skill to make this character very interesting. I had tuned out most criticisms of this movie when it first came out in order to see the movie with an open mind but unfortunately, the criticisms against this movie is all true. I hope a better effort is made or the upcoming Dr. Strange and Black Panther movies and that this Fantastic Four movie serves as a warning to the future producers /directors of those 2 upcoming movies as to what not to do.",Fantastic Four

EVERY character is thoroughly unlikable. No friendships (the key to their team & the longevity of the franchise), no integrity, no humor... really nothing but selfish self-interest. Makes for incredibly bland & 2 dimensional characters.

Marvel took 3rd tier characters Iron Man & Captain America, and 4th tier characters Black Panther & Doctor Strange and made them nuanced, interesting, relevant, and even beloved.

457,Lott444,Like a reel was missing or something,4,8 August 2015,"I rated this movie 4 but it deserved less. It's a shame because it did have potential.I will forgo the poor decisions of the director, writers, cast and studio which turned fans off to this movie and judge it based on the finished film alone.GOOD ~The principles all did well with their acting. The guy who played Franklin Storm did well. Kate Mara is a very attractive young woman and tried to communicate subtle attraction to Reed and this worked, as little as it was in the movie. ~Um. The music was heartfelt and carried a tone of optimism in the first half. ~Uhhh... um... Doom was made to be an intellectual equal to Reed which is true to a comics and a great improvement over knock-off Norman Osborn Doom from the Tim Story movie.BAD ~Well, Reed, Franklin and Doom never really sell the idea that they are world-class geniuses. None of their dialogue or mannerisms hint at a restrained genius IQ. We just are told they are geniuses and expected to believe. Sue kind of gets a pass because she says a few brainy things and types fast on a computers while reading IP addresses and binary. Good enough. ~Love triangle. No. Doom should be obsessed with only his work and ambition. I wan a Doom true to the source material for once. A Doom who would mock Reed for such a silly emotion as love. Reed should be more obsessed with his work and lost in his head solving multiple complex projects at once, to the frustration of Sue. ~Doom looked like a garbage bag hobo. ~The conflict between Reed and Ben is never really resolved in a manner which makes sense. It's brushed over in a sentence and suddenly all is forgiven. ~Ben kills people. I know they're terrorists but still. ~The one year time skip. It feels like the second act was skipped over in that one year. The first act introduces the characters, the second act sets up the problems and the third is where they overcome the problem. In this movie the second act is so short that it feels like it doesn't exist.~The transformation scenes were pretty scary and they frightened the children watching the movie in front of and next to me.I could write more but I have a 1,000 word limit.

This story seemed extremely under developed. The movie time was pretty short. Was this suppose to be some kind of short story? This contain none of the excitement like the original Fantastic Four movies. Even Victor was boring. Ugh! This is just another sign Hollywood needs to give the remakes a rest.

But when I saw the movie it was not as good as I thought that it was going to be, I mean it was an OK movie but you should probably wait for this movie to come out on DVD. I do not recommend this to small children because this movie has a lot more violence than the original franchise of The Fantastic Four because kids love The Fantastic Four due to their super powers and you should not put that much violence or mild language in a super hero film like that especially GD. Maybe by 2017 The Fantastic Four sequel will be better and get a good rating from the critics & the moviegoers, but then again I do not know for sure what will actually happen when this movie does come out, but I am hyped that it will be better.",Fantastic Four
460,chasebangerter,"A Movie That Starts Out Promising, But Progressively Got Worse As It Goes On",5,25 January 2016,"Strangely enough, this is the fourth movie of the ill-fated franchise that is simply known as the Fantastic Four. The one that came out during the 2000's is one of my least favorite super hero movies I've even seen. I will say that while the new one is an improvement, it's not saying that much. Fantastic Four is an origin story of our lead heroes as they try to do some interdimensional traveling and they get superpowers from the result of it. I will give it this, in the first half of the movie, I was actually pretty invested in the story. I especially liked Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan's characters as Reed Richards and Johnny Storm. There is some intrigue about the characters and what's going on with them. There are some things in the beginning that I felt could be done better (Sue Storm came off just a little bit weird), but overall, I thought it was pretty good. While the first half I don't have too many problems with, it's the second half that I feel that the movie just deconstructed itself into nothing. It kind of shocked me that when I think about what happens in the middle of the movie, do I realize that almost nothing happens. I mean, there are some concepts in the second half that sounds interesting, but because of the way that it told its story, it felt like the filmmakers wasn't really trying. It just feel bland, generic, and nothing of interest really happen. It doesn't really help that the climax of the movie is one of the most boring climaxes I think I've ever seen in a long while. it just doesn't felt like that there's anything at stake is going on. The action is about as underwhelming that you could possibly imagine and the effects were cheaply made. It also doesn't help that Dr. Doom was wearing one of the worst costumes I've seen in recent memories. So in the end, the last twenty minutes of the movie was terrible but it's hard for me to damn the whole movie just because of the last half. Like I said, I think the first half was actually pretty good but it felt like that the people behind it just gave up in the second half and considering the production problems that it had, I could easily see why. Overall, while I do think it's not a good superhero movie, I don't think it's one of the worst. There's not much to recommend unless if you're curious about the movie but, overall, it's definitely worth the skip.",Fantastic Four

462,shamrock_d,I thought it was going to be bad.,9,26 October 2015,"I thoroughly enjoyed it.I have always been a Fantastic 4 fan since their early comic days and when the first Fantastic 4 movie came out, I loved it. My comic heroes came alive on screen doing the things they always did.I can understand comic fans getting mad because it was probably too much of a departure from the heroes they learned to love. When I first saw the trailer, I thought: ""Oh no, these are not the Fantastic 4."" However, when I started watching the movie, I found myself drawn into their early years growing up with their ideas and dismissal by the rest of the sane world around them but nevertheless hanging on to their dreams.Despite the slow pace of development of the plot and characters, I never felt bored, luckily I guess for the fact that I also like good drama and the deeper aspects of science fiction - teleportation, inter-dimensional travel and alien forms of life (in this case, energy or life force).I liked the way how Dr. Doom came to life and the ingenuity of the Fantastic 4 in the way they defeated him. Short, yes, it was and likely did little to satisfy action fans who went hoping to see the old Fantastic 4 in extended action or in the genre of other sci-fi action movies like the Avengers, Thor, etc. I don't blame them.I admit, however, certain parts were rushed particularly towards the end. One very obvious part is where Franklin Storm dies under the hand of Doom. It was too quick and illogical - Doom leaving the others while killing Franklin Strom with no hesitation whatsoever. That (and some other parts of the script) could have been done better. It could be keeping to a schedule to finish the film or some budgetary pressure to end the filming.Despite the faults here and there, I admit I enjoyed the movie and probably even more than the first installment as it was, yes, darker with more drama and sci-tech thrown in - a mix that appeals to me.As one reviewer put it, this movie builds a solid foundation for the future and, the way I see it, the potential for a good TV series along the lines of Minority Report.",Fantastic Four
463,Supereyes206,Not as bad as everyone says but still deserves a 3-4 out of 10.,3,28 November 2016,"It's been a year and a half since the movie was released and I only watched it recently. The reason I did not watch it when it was initially released in cinemas was due to the backlash of reviews having nothing but criticism to say about the film. While I still had some interest, as I like most superhero flicks, I didn't want to because I learned to expect to be disappointed by many comic book movies that were released prior: Hulk (2003), Superman Returns (2006), X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) for example. Judging from the amount of reviews, it may have had the largest amount of negative reviews in history. By that, I mean the ratio.But having finally seen the film, I must say it is really not as bad as many people made it out to be and I did enjoy it for what it was, but ultimately, I think it still deserves its reception. When I first saw the teaser, unlike most people, I thought it looked like a fresh and original take on the comic, but a serious version, and I was excited and very optimistic. There were no suits, but I thought it might be a more original take like the X- Men series. Then the new trailers came out, while it still looked separate from the original films, it didn't look like it had that much action, but I still wanted to give it a shot. It looked like it had story.The casting and acting I thought were good except maybe Von Doom...while this version of the characters are way younger than its predecessors, I was fine with it, but as for the actor playing the Doom--not that I didn't enjoy his performance in the beginning, and I thought it was good, but it was more like a teen-aged version. His jealously and motivations makes sense somewhat but isn't fulfilled in the story. As Dr. Doom however, it wasn't believable but I will get to that later.Chemistry between most of the characters is good but there wasn't enough. The story managed to be strongly separate from the originals which was somewhat of an advantage. Most reboots I watch tend to have some boring bits that are very reminiscent of the originals like The Amazing Spider-Man and some parts of Man of Steel.The dialogue wasn't corny. There weren't too many moments that made me roll my eyes which was good. I was enjoying the movie for what it was despite the film not spending too much time outside the lab. The team spends most of their time at the lab testing their powers, and I would have been able to tolerate that if only the final act didn't feel so rushed and if they had more scenes outside the lab.All the way through, the film has potential even though I might agree that it is a little boring, but not terrible. But where the film ultimately hits the shark is in the sudden climax.Doom, whom we last saw an hour and a half ago in the movie returns as Dr. Doom, and the film ultimately fails for so many reasons. Suddenly, it feels as though that the film wants to wrap itself up so abruptly and it felt to me like they gave up. The film reaches the point when it lets the audience know that this is the climax. Unfortunately this is the first time we see the Fantastic Four use all their powers together at once to fight the villain who doesn't show up until the end of the movie. And as for the look of the character, that's another story...The Thing looked pretty decent enough. Despite the characters not wearing the costumes, the characters as a whole were more important, but with Doom, he has to wear a costume...and my lord, does it look terrible. The face...the green...volcanic lines. He doesn't look scary at all. This is by far the sh**est looking villain design in all of movie history. Even saying that does not justify how bad it is, but let me raise the steaks. Some of the first released images you see of character in an upcoming superhero movie look bad and you get a pretty bad impression. Sometimes trailers change your mind once you see the characters in motion. But this character looks just as bad as he does in a still photo as he does in motion. It's so dreadful looking, that this is half the reason why this movie gets such a low rating. Everything is so rushed and makes no sense at all. The team already decides their destiny and Dr. Doom being vengeful and angry makes no sense. Why does he suddenly hate them and want ultimate power and see the world burn? WTF? It was until this point when the film lost all its effort to tell a story. So...Doom is destroying the universe, or Earth through...portals....and...it's not very explanatory at all unlike it was in the first two acts...it's like The Avengers and other alien invasion movies mixed together in one movie.There's a nice moment when we see the team all together at the end, but none after that. This is it, that's the ending, when there could have been so much more. I think had the film just extended itself to another half hour, giving us 2 more sequences with F4 in action before the climax, and taking time out of the lab. And if they completely changed Dr. Doom's look, then the film might have worked.It's not as terrible as people made it out to be. It had potential, but ultimately the climax and Dr. Doom destroyed everything. I doubt a sequel will be made. It's a shame we won't be seeing another F4 movie for some time.3/10.",Fantastic Four

Probably meant for the really young audience of under 13, as if I was only 16 I would probably want to get a refund.

468,neighborlee_fromPalmer,Unique spin on a fantastic series,7,16 August 2015,"I, unlike so many other harsher critics, enjoyed this movie a lot, and though in the end it doesn't matter because few of us really rely on reviews 100% of the time to go or not go to a movie, you could do a lot worse than this new spin on the Fantastic 4 universe.It wasn't because the acting was simply amazing, by 'well known' actors, it wasn't, but just because they were a 'new' fantastic 4 team, doesn't mean we should pay them any less respect or give them a fair shot.I'm so tired of the hate at such movies, do people watch these expecting to be dazzled every second of the movie ? I never do, I simply watch or I do not, based on the title and what type of movie I expect it will be, and sit back and relax and try to enjoy it, which after all, isn't that what movies are all about ? You can argue, oh NOT another sequel , and yes it is that, but judging it solely on that, or the ineffective acting because they aren't well known entities, or some other 'expectation' is just a bad way to go at movie going, and insufficient respect to hard work.You don't have to love the support actors or every moment of the script or visuals, but you owe it to the hard work of everyone involved, to do what most of us do at movies, go in expecting what you get based only on what you likely know you'll see, which is exactly what I always do, and everyone should.I have no patience for anyone who gives a movie a '1' rating ( or similarly childish like 'fantastic FLOP'), because they aren't here to critique anything, just hear themselves think and attempt to make a 'name' for themselves at the price of hard work, even if you think all involved were overpaid for what you got.People forget, not everyone can 'act', it takes a mindset and a willingness to take the subject serious enough to put yourself IN the shoes of who you are playing so the audience is catapulted into a state of belief in what they are seeing, and have a good time.I always do that unlike some other hate filled posts here and we always get them, and knowing full well what to expect, I enjoyed it , from beginning to end and look forward to a sequel with the came cast.I review a movie based on my feelings about the acting, script, production , visuals and score, but most of all, was I 'entertained' enough to suspend my reality and come out of it thinking about the universe I and everyone else are part of, and dream of more and better things.I got that from this movie, and if you didn't, well this type of movie wasn't for you.Before I came to review Fantastic 4 2015, I looked at both of the prior movies, and they too , though not quite as bad as this one, similarly were given awful ratings , and I can't help but wonder, by who, what did they go into the movies expecting, and what precisely did they not feel they got, enough to mark a movie well enough done to remove their reality for a couple hours, sufficient to mark it that low.Everyone wants to be a critique, but you can't effectively do that, never, unless you put on your objective hat, and agree to immerse yourself into the movies reality.Yes, I felt some of the acting was a bit unconvincing, but that might be me expecting the same from a different set of actors, versus what we had from the 2 prior movies, and that's not really fair, but by the end of the movie I was losing that slight skew for their acting performances and just let myself settle into a new team of 4.Some argue movie took too long to get going, but I couldn't disagree more, as I wanted a different back story, something different from the prior releases, and we got it.The visuals were just as good as anything that's come before it if you want to compare it to the other movies, 1 and 2.Yes it was another fantastic 4 movie, but I enjoyed it not because of its faults, but because I felt 'entertained' enough to keep watching.That to me means the movie was a success.I'm not won over easily, but if suspension of reality takes hold of me and lets go only till the movie is over, then I'm good.If you are into the Sci-fi genre, and if you like the Fantastic 4 enough to detach yourself from the other movies and enjoy a new '4' team for what it is, entertaining, and aren't someone who is 'super critical', then head out and buy your tickets because you will be entertained just as I was.",Fantastic Four
469,bigconoruk,"Disappointing, but not terrible.",4,29 September 2015,"Nowadays, we are getting lots of fantastic superhero flicks. (No pun intended) Like Iron Man, The Dark Knight, and Guardians of the Galaxy. And, we always think that we might never get another superhero movie that is atrocious like Batman & Robin and Superman IV. Unfortunately, for most people, they were wrong. I mean, DEAD wrong. The reboot of Fantastic Four here was torn into BILLIONS of pieces by critics and audiences alike. But, to be honest, I DON'T think this movie is as terrible as everyone thinks it is but I don't wan't to praise this movie too much because if I do, I will be hated by millions. Anyway, let's start from the beginning. The very beginning.When I first saw the trailers for Fantastic Four, I thought this was going to be a GOOD movie. Why? Because two reasons. One: the film is directed by Josh Trank who directed a movie I clearly enjoy, Chronicle. And two: the cast is pretty well-picked. We got Miles Teller from the masterpiece Whiplash and Michael B. Jordan from Chronicle. I was very optimistic about this film ever since. When it came out, I was in the biggest shock of my movie life when this was panned with lots and lots of criticism! When I was about to watch this movie, I was extremely nervous that I will waste 100 minutes watching this film, but in the end, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Was it disappointing? Absolutely. Is it terrible? Not even close, by surprise.I'll start off by bashing the pacing of the film. Good gosh, it's so slow! I mean, it's so slow that the main characters didn't get their powers until we're like HALFWAY through the movie! After that, the film speeds up a bit too much. But, here's a fine thing about it, it keeps me from being bored in some parts with it's important plot point entries. Of course, some parts without important plot points are boring. My thoughts on the visual effects is polarized. Some are good and some are... meh. Not all visual effects in this movie are good like the flames of the Human Torch and the Thing and *sighs* Do I even have to mention the disgusting look of Dr. Doom?! The visual effects that I DO like is the powers of the Invisible Women and the world-building of another dimension. Or is it a planet or... nevermind.That's pretty much it I can say about Fantastic Four. It's not good but not terrible either. Don't bother watching this film, anyway. It doesn't suit your time. Go watch Ant-Man, Minions, Mission: Impossible or even Kingsman. We have learned that not every superhero movie today can entertain us after all.Film Score: 4/10 - Underwhelming (Still no pun intended)",Fantastic Four
470,rohitkhanna-33714,A Stupid Reboot,1,7 August 2015,"Over the last decade, we have seen a number of superhero movies get a much needed reboot. After the atrocious Batman & Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. Eight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?Reed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.When they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.The one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.When a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.I had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.The story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.Then there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.",Fantastic Four
471,fanatix-05187,Not so Fantastic..!!!,4,9 August 2015,"What can be said that's not been mentioned above. I think my main disappointment was watching the very talented Miles Teller limit his ability in such a drab movie that really done him no favours.Overall the movie was poorly put together like a mismatched jigsaw and written in a very typical lets start again type fashion, which for avid Marvel fans injected a very large dose of bore factor for a majority of the film.What really annoyed me was the fact that Marvel obviously gave up on the film after the first 15 minutes and to top it, they didn't even put in a trailer at the end of the 10 minute credits. A big 'OMG' was shouted out in the movie theatre by the few that remained!! The kids will enjoy it but for seasoned Marvel'ers, send the gf/wife instead and don't waste 100 minutes of your life!!",Fantastic Four

Guys?? Why? Why is the motive to make a reboot out of a comic book. And if so is your very intention then come up with something that could actually make sense... This is just a headache and nothing...",Fantastic Four

The other Fantastic four movies failed too but at least it fail of what the comic books made them so special it's really a huge shame when it doesn't have anything to do with the comic books in general and when you add it all up the Hammer head film is the only one where they choose to fight crime *AND* not cause the destruction and chaos along the way HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN HOW THIS IN 2 REBOOTS YOU TRIED TO MAKE IT BETTER!?!

So I just wanted to get to the part of the Fantastic Four crew using their powers, fight enemies with it, and get to Doctor Doom. But anyways the movie was not what I was expecting it was just a whole movie of them talking and nothing else. The only good things about the movie was the Casting Choices, Special Effects, Doctor Doom, the fight scene, Human Torch and that's pretty much it. But for the bad things about the movie was that it felt extremely slow and the story was just a repeated origin story of the Fantastic Four. So overall I give this movie a 6 because I don't know what to think about the movie besides of me being so confused about it.",Fantastic Four
476,markcampbell,Only see it if you want to be disappointed.,3,5 August 2015,"I'll be concise: this FANTASTIC FOUR reboot is a waste of your time. It is not a bad film, so much as a pointless one. The acting is adequate. The script is terrible. There is not a trace of wit or reality to any of the dialogue. Characterisation is two-dimensional at best. The effects are, in comparison to other films of this type, poor. There is a story, but no plot. The final 'showdown' with Dr Doom takes place in the last 5 minutes. To describe it as perfunctory is to be kind. Only see this film if you have an 'unlimited' cinema pass for one of the chains - please don't spend money on it. At the special Cineworld preview, everyone sat through the credits waiting for an extra scene. Nope, nothing. ""That was a load of sh*t!"" exclaimed someone in the suddenly silent auditorium. Oh yes.",Fantastic Four
477,SpaceRain,Fantastic Bore,2,24 August 2015,"I finally came around to seeing this, since I was able to find a decent camera quality online, and I have to say...wow this was boring as hell. Seriously. I got so bored that about midway I paused it and tried taking a nap, because I thought I was tired. But no, I was actually bored! Holy *beep* this was one of the most boring superhero movies I've ever seen--like Hulk-level boring. The main characters...had NO development at all! Sue Storm, what the hell?? To me she was just a character who shows up and says her lines, that was it. I don't remember a single moment where she shows any emotion, or any development whatsoever. I seriously can't think of a single way to describe her, other than she was an attractive blonde girl who can turn invisible and make force fields. Ben Grimm also had just as much development--basically none, except for I guess he's dependent on Reed Richards? Johnny Storm had very little development too; he was a bit of a troublemaker in the beginning and that was just about it. Reed Richards was slightly awkward and nerdy in the beginning but after that--you guessed it--nothing. This movie completely destroyed these characters and gave them no personality, at all. I guess Doom was kinda developed but he had no motive at all for being a villain, and man did he look awful. Not to mention the actors showed no emotion in their performances. They were just so flat and sounded bored, it was almost depressing to listen to them talk. I only remember this movie having one action scene. That's right, one. For a superhero movie, that's abysmal. It should have at least 2 or 3 good action scenes but instead, it has one very short, terrible one at the end. I guess I can't really comment on the CGI since I saw a camera quality of it but the excessively cartoonish last fight looked ridiculous. I just couldn't buy any of it. Did I mention how boring this movie is??? Basically, this movie was dreadful. It did have one good scene, when they go to the other dimension, since there was some element of tension and intensity there, but other than that, NOTHING remotely interesting happens in this. I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch this (and before any of you guys say it, it's actually legal to stream movies online, even if for free). For those of you who haven't seen it, it's just as bad as you know it is. Bland, boring, ZERO character development, and ONE short action scene where you can hardly tell what's going on. I'm beating a dead horse by saying this, but don't even bother to see this movie. Watch the original Fantastic Four with Jessica Alba, it's actually a masterpiece compared to this.",Fantastic Four
478,ksmoo,People.. disregard all the negativity about this film,6,8 August 2015,"Everyone is such a movie critic.. but yet they work at McDonalds every day. Come on people.. the movie was not great, but FAR from bad or terrible. It honestly deserves a 5 rating, but i gave it a 6 due to all the people improperly bashing the film for some reason. There is a work up to get an understanding of how the powers come about. Prior to that, a brief history of some of the characters. The story-line was not great, but it fulfilled most of the basic necessities. Was the acting great, probably not. Could some of the characters have used different actors, well maybe. And the ending.. yes, it absolutely underwhelmed. All in all, every film is going to have some flaw or point that someone will have something negative to say about it. My advice.. go enjoy the movie when it's not at the peak price point, like earlier in the day before evening prices begin.",Fantastic Four

The movie was about the origins of the Fantastic four, but the producers forget the actually read the story? If the movie was about them getting their powers, at least respect the story! I mean seriously, this is about the story, not some cheap special effect movie... and if you do, make it impressive...On both accounts they missed it horrible! Shame on you! How they got their powers was in a previous movie already, so why make it different? I really tried understanding it, but I couldn't and dominated everything. Please make a next movie, but make it in line of the stories and it will be enjoyable!",Fantastic Four
480,alexczx,"People, please stop saying it's a Marvel movie! It's NOT",1,5 August 2015,"Just because it's based on Marvel comics doesn't mean it's made by Marvel Studios. It's made by FOX, which licensed the rights to the FF characters from Marvel years ago. Thus, any comparisons to other MCU films such as the recent Ant-Man are totally meaningless. And that is why it's such a mess. Marvel had no control over what FOX did with their source material.For those not aware, this film was plagued by problems from the start. The director was all but banned from the set and editing room in the final stage of production, after which a good deal of the footage was dumped and re-shot. In the end, it was slapped together by one of the producers and a temporary director, and the results show: there is a disconnect between the first two acts and the third. It's almost like there are two separate movies trying to co-exist, and it doesn't work.",Fantastic Four
481,mrcricken8,Worse than it's predecessors,2,5 August 2015,"I'm honestly not surprised one bit that I didn't enjoy this movie.The trailer was awful,and it was obvious the movie was only made for Fox to keep the rights to this piece of garbage. The main problem with this movie is that it tries so hard to be dark and gritty.The movie isn't gritty at all.Dark?Yes at some points,but not in a good way. Another problem with this abomination is it's pace.Oh my god,the pace of this movie is incredibly slow.I'm in disbelief I didn't fall asleep.Honestly,the films pace is so slow,it's hard to know what's going on at times due to how bored you are. Next is the acting.While I though young Miles Teller did decent,the other actors were awful.I honestly feel everyone,especially Kate Mara,was miscast.It seems to me as if every actor was bored,but hey so was the audience! Another problem is the villain.I don't have much to say about Doom,besides the fact that he was forced into the film for the sake of having a villain.He wasn't threatening for even a second;He was just a joke,like the film itself. Lastly,the film is a set up for films to come.It's obvious it is,so Fox can keep the rights.From rumors out there,it's trying to set up sequels,which is true,and it's trying to set itself up with the X-Men Franchise,which I hope not. Overall,the film was an atrocity,just like it's predecessors,and the only good thing was probably the CGI.Then again,it wasn't even that amazing.The CGI wasn't as good,as say,'The Amazing Spider-Man 2'or 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. My rating is a 2/10,and it'd be a 1/10 if the CGI was a tad bit worse.",Fantastic Four
482,davidjmolinari,"Good FF reboot, though ...",6,23 August 2015,"Okay, major Marvel movie fan here so had no choice but to watch. I typically see Marvel movies in the theater twice, but not this one. One reason for the reboot was that they used the same actor as Johnny Storm and Captain America (Chris Evans) in other Marvel movies, so I went in to it with an open mind.I expected to walk into a crap movie based on other reviews but can't say that happened. Perhaps I'm more forgiving or know more about the characters and have a better intuitive grasp of movie links as they happen BUT:The team really was a mix of individuals who were supposed to be a team (which we saw for like ONE fight). Even Reed Richards inviting Ben Grimm on the trip was kind of a favor to a buddy vs. the comics ""needed the best pilot he could trust"". Sue Storm and Johnny Storm couldn't have possibly been less we-grew-up-together. Doom wasn't evolved as a character enough to really justify his actions. Miles Teller as Reed Richards ... really? Had to wonder if the casting director was predisposed to ignore other possibilities. He (the actor) did well with the awkward initial relationship stuff with Sue, but I don't think he pulled off ultra-brilliant as he should have. Ben Grimm turning on his life-long bestie because the gov'meant said he ran away was awfully fast.Now, positives: Michael B. Jordan is always great and brings greatness to his movies, keep eyes on this one. Kate Mara is freaking wonderful, and I think she took on a Sue Storm well - I blame the director or writers for her sudden inexplicable jumps in power level and control. Her initial awkwardness with Reed was ... I'm not blaming her and perhaps not even Miles.Oh, BIG negative: If you're gonna buy out a Marvel franchise and make a Marvel movie, the least you can do is add a Marvel after- credits scene! Tie in or stand out as the exception, and not in a good way!I'll see this when it comes on TV, but (contrary to my nature) won't be buying this on Blu-Ray unless it comes out as ""Fantastic Four - the unf*%ked version"". I'd have thought Stan Lee would be turning in his grave if he were dead; however, he was one of the Exec. Producers! P.S. Stan, love your works outside of this one.",Fantastic Four

They weren't amazing but weren't bad. Let's call this for what it is. They tried. You can tell they tried. But it fell flat. The script was bad. The overall plot wasn't. The idea of going into another dimension, being run by the government, and then becoming a super group is a common idea but not a bad one. The problem is, the characters introductions were forced. It just seemed awkward how all of the fantastic four showed up. And I hated that The Thing and Sue Storm literally never said a word to each other. Not once. They become the fantastic four was very forced. I think had the movie been 30 or 40 minutes longer with some more action thrown in it could have been good. Overall, it was bad and could have been good. I think it's time to revert to the Marvel Cinematic Universe",Fantastic Four
484,emmanuelhenry,Fantastic four is yet another example of a studio cash crab.,5,17 August 2015,"Im going to be honest, i grew up with the original fantastic four from 2005 when i was 5-6 and enjoyed it but when i grew up i realized it was not that great and it was followed with the god awful sequel rise of the silver surfer in 2007. So when i heard there were making a new fantastic four i was like '' this can be interesting or not"" and when i heard that Josh Trank was helm to direct i was excited cause i loved what he did with Chronicle (2012), i thought that was a ''fantastic film'' sorry i had too. Then the cast was announced and i was on board with them, Loved Miles Teller in Whiplash (2014), Michael B Jordan is one of the most underrated actor, Kate Mara ,Jamie Bell who is also great and finally Tobey Kebbell who owned it in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014) as Koba and was the redeeming quality of Wrath of the Titans (2012) However there were rumors that a troubled me that director Josh Trank was having being trouble on set and the production was not the best.The reviews came in wow were they bad and i almost did not see it but my good friend drag me to it and i thought even if its not the best i will still try to have a good time cause my friends were coming so though i will try. And for the first 30 minutes of the movie i was like "" hey i really like this actually"" but when the 2 half stared i was started to understand why the movie was not getting great reviews and movie went down hill real fast. So the plot (sorry i took so long its my first review) there is not much really bunch of really talented smart young people go on a expensive science experiment , accident happens, they get powers and they fight at the end ( if you can call it that) So I'm going have to spoil to get in detail but then again there is not much to spoil so here it comes. Positive: First act, Cast, interesting ideas So like i said the first 20 minutes of the film were really good and was a great set up, i though the cast really worked well and played each character nicely and even some of the dialog at the beginning was not half bad, the scene when they arrive back home thats some good creepy imagery, later there were some good ideas like the idea that when they get there powers there are devastate and think of it as a disability that was kinda new.Negative: Everything else!! Like I said the first act was enjoyable but exactly when they got there to the dimension and you see the bad special effects from a small town school in the middle of nowhere computer class would have from the early 90s but thats just special effects. When they got come and the government came in and the 2act started i was like "" Son of a B*ch when well i learned!!"" and everything falls apart. everything becomes a mess when the 1 year came you knew something was wrong with the production the re shoots were plain obvious and it felt like 20th century fox did the wolverine origins trick on us when the studio has to intervene with the director and there are like '' hey director want to make your film, F**k You we own you!'' ( and takes a dump all over the director's vision) i know studio has to intervene time to time cause there are putting the money into it and hell i don't think Fox is a bad company at all i really like what they been doing with other properties, I loved what they did with the Planet of the Apes franchise lately, X-Men, The Maze Runner and even the new Agent 47 which looks like a bunch of stupid Fun!! But here just too much and i heard Trank was kicked out of editing room maybe cause of his behavior but he posted on twitter that he made a good version of this and he knows this one is not great so i kinda feel it was the studio's fault but i might be wrong who knows. So then the actors just started to loose their steam and stop giving a sh*t and their is guy at they end how was their old friend victor that supposed died and came back and looks like a reject from the phantom menace our a Saturday morning cartoon and some people say its Dr.Doom and their are right but i just can't call him that cause its so awful his character calling him that would be a disparate. Then a the dad/ Mentor dies of Jonny Storm and Sue but they seem to care and then go to dimension Tobey Kebbell in his plastic costume walk like a jackass and says "" Im going to destroy the world and stuff"" thats literally what he said. In some movie this is called a climax but its so poorly directed that no just no. Jamie Bell as the thing forcefully says his line '' its clobbering time"" they all can't seem to fight him and i think Jonny says ""he is stronger than any of us"" and Reed says "" He is not stronger than any of us"" Well no sh*t smart ass.So back to the climax There is one of the most lines ever put on film, Victor to Reed ""Im smarted then you"" Reed ''no I'm started then you'' something like that and I'm not trolling with. In the end this is another waste of potential but then again its better than the 3 ones we got before, this one is worth a rent if you really want to see but i recommend skipping it.",Fantastic Four

Please DO NOT compare this movie with your typical Marvel movie. This movie is NOT a Superhero movie. It is one of the most intriguing SCIENCE FICTION movies I have seen till date. Please do not read the negative reviews about this movie. The acting was amazing (So were the acting choices). The script was good. The best part was the build up to the end. One of the best origin movies for a group of gifted individuals teaming up together. I can't tell too much about this movie because it would spoil the direction in which this movie went. Hats off to the director Josh Trank. I don't care how much of a careless individual he is portrayed to be by the Movie News, his film making skills are top notch to me. And the direction he takes this franchise in is shocking. Some of his choices will make you think, ""Yeah.. This totally makes sense"". The only downfall this movie has is its CGI. In some areas it wasn't great. But other than that it was plain awesome! So again.. DO NOT watch this movie expecting a Marvel Superhero movie. It is NOT. It is undoubtedly a SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE.

490,akirat-16506,The Worst of the 4,3,1 February 2016,"Ignoring all the drama that movie had with its director and a completely reimagining the origin of the Fantastic Four the movie starts off OK and then moves to complete lunacy.The first half of the movie is the origin of how the Fantastic Four got their powers and how they learn to deal with them. Then the last half/third is a poorly constructed action sequence to save the world that also introduces a villain.I think calling what people were doing in this movie as acting is an insult to Actors. If this movie had released before the casing of ""Creed"" Michael B. Jordan would have never had a chance to read for a part. The last part of the film the Actors seem to lose all interest in the film and appear to be just reading lines aloud.Tone of movie goes from serious to a bad cartoon show. An example of this is the character ""Thing."" He is sad and angry most of the film. He has become a killing machine for the government, one scene shows a kill counter of one of his successful missions. But at the end he is happy/friendly and like first part of the film never happened. If the tone and story stayed constant this could have been at least an average movie. I know from all the drama that was reported on the making of this film that the last half is something that the studio filmed without the director because they disliked his cut of the film.So it would be great to see a Director's cut and see if what he was trying to do was really that bad. At the very least it could be a more focused narrative then what came out.It sad the best Fantastic Four film is still Roger Corman's.",Fantastic Four
491,jimmehford,"A boring, dull, and uneventful movie.",1,18 May 2016,"Whenever I see a bad movie, I like to keep an open mind and try to enjoy it regardless of its critical response. If I can be entertained on my own, I will say to the naysayers, ""Screw you then! I'll watch me some Freddy Got Fingered!""Fant4stic is something I've been wanting to watch for a really long time. I keep hearing it's really bad and I needed to see just how bad it was. And was it as bad as everyone says it is?yes. its really that badHere are the reason why this movie is terrible: (also i cant say spoiler alert because there's literally nothing to spoil) 1) The pacing: The entire movie is just build up, but it never stops the build up. I was forty minutes into the movie and I wondered when it was going to start. They build a portal thing to another dimension, get powers, and out of nowhere, the government is using them as weapons a year after they have powers. It just jumps from nothing happening, to everything happening, to nothing happening again. Nothing happens in this movie. Nothing action packed, nothing exciting, nothing terrifying, just nothing at all.2) The characters: How can you make Michael B. Jordan so boring? The Human Torch is supposed to be a wise cracking, impetuous member of the team, but in this movie, he ended up being too serious and not funny at all. Reed Richards is just so boring. He has nothing relatable going on with his personality. He is just smart and knows things. That's it about his character. Ben Grimm is just there. Sue Storm is the stereotypical female character that doesn't like fun and wants to do her work. I don't remember anything about any of these characters. Victor Von Doom has the most interesting character in the film, but the film is never consistent with how he is supposed to act. He's supposed to be the evil genius with a plan up his sleeve, but he ended up genuinely becoming friends with his colleagues and just becomes evil out of nowhere.3) Dr. Doom: He sounds evil. He looks menacing. He acts like he's dangerous. Yet, the film never establishes why he's like this. He becomes evil out of nowhere. They never explain why he's doing the things he's doing. They never explain what kind of powers he has. They never explained why he hated the Fant4stic so much. And they just kill him off in a really anti-climactic battle. They wasted Dr. Doom. They wasted a scary and evil villain to make something that looks like a mannequin. 4) Only one action scene. The final battle.5) There are actually good things about the movie. This is a problem because I really like how they changed it up. They tried to make the chemistry between everyone real. They tried to explain why the Thing says ""It's clobbering time."" They try to make the government use them as weapons. They try to make everyone get together to make a giant climactic battle between differences in beliefs. But the thing is, the negative things about the movie immediately contradicts these good things. Everything good is then taken away by a bad decision in the movie that makes the good things bad. The chemistry ended up being forced. The Thing barely says his catchphrase. The government spends a whole year off-screen making them into weapons. The battle was terrible. Absolutely nothing works in this movie.6) Boring: This is just it. It's so boring. Nothing is happening. The characters do nothing. The movie ends when it just begins. The jokes are lazy. The effects are terrible. The logic makes no sense. And throughout the entire movie, I even forgot I was watching a movie about Marvel's Fantastic Four instead of a crappy sci-fi movie.Fant4stic is amazing. Never have I seen a movie go from 0 to 100 in terribleness. It is truly an epic fail. and not even a stan lee cameo",Fantastic Four

Disappointing and boring...,1,2 May 2016,"I saw this film to discover why all the criticism the considers a disgust and my final surprise was very similar to the one in the entire world. Fantastic Four is a film disappointing and boring, without surprises, What is the error? Are Not the actors, each one of them made a decent work, the problem here was the script, the plot and the story. This film is an introduction of 1 hour with 46 minutes, which is a total error.Any movie has an introduction, a development and a conclusion, but Fantastic Four does not have the last 2 aspects (and that are too important) history develops slowly, giving to know the characters one by one in a way little showy and poor. Development in the characters does not exist, there is no personality in them, not even the villain is interesting, there is no reason and no reason to be villain.Josh Trank and the same FOX not knew handle the start of these super heroes, let us hope that in future, the 4 fantastic or ""Fantastic Four"" have a movie just and decent, let us hope that Disney-Marvel take advantage of this situation.

What was supposed to be the point of making this movie?Even though I read a few of the negative reviews, I decided to watch with an open mind. Unfortunately it feel short in almost every aspect. First the casting for this movie seemed to be way off. The characters didn't really seem to fit their roles. I'm no expert on the F4 universe but as a movie the characters didn't work. The events/pace in the movie didn't work. It was rushed when it should have explored and slow when it should have been fast. Genius was common place. Anything that needed to be accomplished was just sorted in a few giggly moments between the actors. It gave no validity to the movie.There's so many issues with this movie, but down to its core, it just doesn't work. If you're curious, wait for it to be provided on a streaming service to attempt a watch.",Fantastic Four

I have read some FF4 comic in the past, and i never recall that Johnny were Black? As we have seen lately, it seams that for every ""Reboot/Remake"" of Marvel hero's, they just getting worse. The only good thing about this movie, is that it only 100 minutes long, even that it feels longer. This movie are no doubt the most boring superhero movie I have seen for a long time. Even Hulk from 2003 is better than this ""Fantastic"" movie. Maybe Movie studio's should stop making new beginning all the time from ""Reboot/Remake"" and just going forward with the stories. We already knows how the superhero's got their power from previous movies, we don't need to get it shown for every new ""Reboot or Remake"".",Fantastic Four
499,It_Is_Minus_9,Memo to Fox: please return the F4 to Marvel. You have crapped all over this franchise.,1,23 August 2015,"Ugh. All I wanted was a good F4 movie. One that could at least stand in conversation with the decent X-Men movies we've gotten in the past few years. These characters deserve a cinematic resurgence. And here it is, the reboot. Back to basics with a new director and a new set of actors. What could go wrong? I, like you, am aware of all the negative hubbub online that surrounds this movie: Trank's apologetic tweet, the leaked first draft of the script that included a battle with Galactus and the appearance of Mole Man, and the reports of massive reshoots and problematic edits that make the end product feel unfinished and rushed. It'd be easy to trash this movie based on those aspects alone, but let's just consider the actual movie we got for this review. Not what could've been, not what almost was. What IS. Let us judge the movie Fox chose to release to us theatrically.I've seen it. And it's a pile of garbage.Let's start with the awful casting. Kate Mara does not emote. Just hides behind her wig. Jamie Bell is terrible as Ben Grimm AKA 'The Thing.' They could've at least affected his voice in some way to deepen it and make it sound Thing-like, but they didn't. So we're left with a normal, puny voice coming out of a hunk of CGI crap. It doesn't read as 'real,' it regrettably reads as 'this is a temporary track while we work on the real ADR.' The actor who plays Doom also suffers from this baffling creative choice. He sounds like a stuffy Englishman imitating an American accent, not Dr. Doom! Cheap VFX -- The Human Torch's flight scenes (all TWO of them!) are awful. He looks like unrendered CGI. The Thing looks cartoony. And Mr. Fantastic's stretchability looks like something out of The Mask -- a movie that's more than twenty years old. Planet Zero looked like something out of a generic video game. And why mess with Doom's design? He looks awesome in the comics, and in the other movies, why make him look like a Power Rangers villain in this version? VFX company for this should be banned from making any more movies.Terrible script -- not sure if this is the editor's fault, or the writer's, but the origin is all screwed up. Why not have Sue teleport with them? Her gaining her invisibility --a staple of this franchise!-- is a tacked-on afterthought. She gets it from the shockwave once they return? Then why doesn't the whole city turn invisible? They were hit by the very same shockwave she was! But, no. So idiotic.Once the Four get their trademark powers, do we spend time with them? Do we witness their pain, their confusion, the fallout from their experiment gone wrong? Do we watch them cope with these supernatural changes to their bodies and react in horror? Nope. Not even close. We get a title card that says 'One year later' and we skip over what could have been a section of interesting scenes in favor of a lame military subplot with The Thing being used as a Special Ops weapon.But what about the action, you ask? Surely, that must be fun to watch? NO. There's literally ONE ACTION SCENE in the whole movie and it lasts about a minute and a half. It's the worst and most anti-climactic CBM battle ever put to film. It lacks stakes. We don't have enough visual information to process what threats the F4 (finally grouped together as the super team we recognize) face on 'Planet Zero,' so we're just staring at muddled pixels of CGI as the actors clumsily float around on wires to defeat Dr. Doom using 'teamwork,' I guess? Or punching? It's honestly as dumb as it sounds. They kind of work together to get the Torch to do something and Reed to distract him, and Sue to do nothing, so The Thing can punch Doom.That's it. That's not only their big SOLE action scene, it's also their big ticket climax. What a joke.Just rent the older ones with Jessica Alba. At least those movies --while flawed and forgettable-- understood that you need to... A) have the team fight together and learn how to work together, B) show each team member experiencing their changes, learning how to use their powers, C) understand Doom's motives and watch the team face him, and D) end the movie with a climactic battle that lasts longer than 90 seconds.Thanks for nothing, Fox.",Fantastic Four
500,wiggityp,Not that Bad,7,30 November 2015,"Def not the best MCU movie, but really none of them are gonna go down in history as major cinematic achievements. While F4 was certainly not as good as Iron Man or The Avengers it pretty much lived up to my (admittedly low) expectations.Really the bad was mostly due to weird editing that seemed to affect the pacing unfavorably. Could have definitely been longer as well, which could've helped a lot I think.But overall its pretty entertaining just for some popcorn fun, which really is all these movies are ever going to be.Rabid fanboys are so lame. For real, what is the point of all the hate? Even if you did hate it, just STFU and move on to another movie to watch because no one cares about your opinions. Seriously, 4.3 is ridiculously low. I think a 6 is pretty fair.If you're on the fence about watching, I say check it out with minimal expectations and you will probably enjoy it for the most part.",Fantastic Four
501,illjwamh,"Hating this movie must just be the ""cool"" thing to do",7,14 August 2015,"This movie wasn't amazing, but it in no way deserves the score it currently has (3.9). It seems to me that people went in having already decided to dislike it, and nobody wants to be the one to go against popular opinion by saying it wasn't bad.The one bit of criticism that I feel has some merit is that the climax is rushed. The movie is actually quite short, so filmmakers certainly had enough time to put more in if they'd wanted. A wasted opportunity, I felt.Aside from that, though, I enjoyed it. It was supposed to be an origin story, and it did that very well. The effects were infinitely superior to the 2005 version, and the acting was up and down. I think Chris Evans was a slightly better Human Torch, but I prefer Kate Mara's Invisible Woman. Miles Teller's Reed was a bit weak at times, but nothing too horrible. By far the best performance was Reg E. Cathey as Dr. Franklin Storm; it's a shame his part wasn't bigger.People have been comparing this unfavorably to movies like The Avengers, and I really don't think that's fair. True, it's not nearly as good as The Avengers, but few comic book movies are. Had this come out in say, 2008, the response would have been mostly positive, I think. Especially since, as I said, it was certainly much better than the '05 attempt - and not just in effects, though that was definitely the most obvious improvement.I hope all the impotent internet rage doesn't dissuade them from making a sequel, since they've set themselves up nicely for one and I'd like to see it. I don't know what people were expecting, but we were promised an origin movie and we got one.",Fantastic Four
502,markhalpin40,Ignore the haters and give it a go.,8,2 December 2015,"It is a travesty that this film only has a score of 4.3. My only assumption is that the majority of people who voted are brain dead teenagers who vote negatively on anything that doesn't have lots of explosions in it. If you are looking for 2 hours of fighting with millions of bullets and explosions galore then this is not the movie for you. In defence of the brain dead, I guess fans of the super hero genre expect full on action in their films as it resembles the comics. But I actually fell asleep during the action sequences in both the last Transporters film with Mark Walberg and The Avengers Age of Ultron as 2 hours of constant fighting, to me lacks intelligence and becomes mind numbingly boring. This film however is a much more intellectual and an adult approach to the genre which I found very refreshing. I would also say it was very brave of the director to take this approach as he must have known the teenagers and brain dead would hate it. Another reviewer said he was waiting for it to get bad but it never did and that was my thinking as well. Others have slated the lack of chemistry between the actors but I thought that was deliberate as in reality people like this would be the sort who don't make friends easily. There were some negative points to the film as I agree some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy and the ending seemed very rushed but overall I loved it and will be watching it again soon so all I can say is give it a chance, ignore the haters and make your own mind up.",Fantastic Four
503,viktor-hammarberg,4.2? Not even close.,8,5 November 2015,"This is how my journey went; from trailer release to sitting down in my bed with a bag of chips and giving this a go despite its abysmal rating: 27 Jan: Teaser trailer released. So damn pumped. Miles Teller? Yes. That chick? Yes. Awesome. 19 April: Full-length trailer released. Still pretty pumped. Never was a fan of the previous installments (with Alba and all them) though. But I loved Chronicle, so I trust the director. Also, origin stories are awesome. And Marvel means high budget. High budget is fun, may not always translate into good, but certainly fun. What could go wrong? 7 Aug: Movie has been released. I'm not rushing to the cinema though, I'm assuming it'll land at like a high 6 or low 7, but ambitiously hoping for something short of an 8. But whaaaaaat. I check the ratings now and then the coming weeks and watch the ratings plummet. What the hell? Could it really be that bad? 5 Nov: Nope. Turns out there was an error in the IMDb rating calculation system because this movie is a 7 at worst. Plain and simple, in my opinion obviously. don't know what people were expecting. This movie is like progressive deep house: constantly slowly building up, never really dropping. And I appreciate those types of movies. Kinda like Full Metal Jacket (though I don't want to comparing those two) in a way. I wish more Marvel movies were structured like this, rather than the usual mainstream mayhem (which is also fun, but you could balance the 2 and make something really fresh).The way I rate movies: 10 means there is absolutely nothing I can think of or pinpoint that would have made the movie better, and the more things I can think of that could be changed/improved, the lower the rating. This one landing at a 7.5, as there were 2 major things I think could use improvement. Overall, even though it certainly is no masterpiece, this is a solid flick. If you like movies, watch it. Because it's good, and it's chill.",Fantastic Four
504,paul006,Nowhere near as bad as its reputation- it's actually a decent movie,7,11 August 2015,"First two thirds were decent with good acting, engaging character arcs etc. It was at least as engaging as a origin story as something like Sam raimi spider-man etc. I genuinely haven't understood some of the reviews that have said that the cast had no chemistry and the acting was poor -could not disagree more.The last third was less engaging, but have still seen worse final acts and cgi battles in super hero/ genre movies. Whether this was the result of all the behind the scenes trouble etc is up for debate. I do think the poor reviews and general bashing of the film have been unfair and to some extent jumping on a band wagon. Josh Tranks alleged behaviour not withstanding, I actually feel sorry for the cast and crew as I feel this film and their work has been treated unfairly.Ignore the bad reviews, see it and make up your own mind.",Fantastic Four
505,rockandhockey,Great Stars Diminished By Poor Plot,4,7 August 2015,"Ladies and gentlemen, I had huge hopes for this movie. I personally love the lead roles (until you go outside the fantastic four), I think that they have had great young careers and they show huge amounts of promise. I think that someday in the future they will all be even bigger stars than they currently are, and are becoming, but I think all of them will look back and realize that this was a poor investment of their time, because this movie is a total bust.Now, I understand that there are a plethora of movies that are around 100 mins long, but for this type of superhero movie, where you had to establish a past, acknowledge the general issue to be addressed by the movie, and still have time for the rest of the plot and the decent ending, it doesn't work. By about 40 mins in they were just beginning to get some of their powers. That leaves them with an hour to deal with the rest of the movie, which is not enough, again.I didn't like the first movie, I thought it was way too targeted at a very young audience, and I thought that this would be much better because it seemed to have more of a darker side to it, but the first one at least gave you the entire story. There are plot holes galore in this one.For instance, they rode the tail of a worm hole back to earth. And then just left it there, like it was no big deal, they didn't finish the ending, they didn't describe any back lash, they didn't do anything with the ending. Instead, after Von Doom almost destroys the world after they just reopened a portal to ""Planet Zero"", they get a big government contract and a huge lab, seemingly just because. Now I understand that one wasn't the worst but it bothered me so I had to get it off my chest.Second, what was the energy on ""Planet Zero."" was it radioactive, did it change their DNA, what did it do... Oh that's right, they were just concerned with going back.Third, the fight scene, are you kidding me, there are about 50 different things wrong with it, like how did Reed magically gain the strength to decompress his arm back to normal size, how did Johnny break out of his rocky prison, none of it really makes any sense. Then to top it off, it took maybe 10 mins and then it was done, left incomplete, like this movie should have been.Fourth, the script. These writers can't honestly believe that these lines are good enough for this style of movie. They probably told each other to look into their eyes a total of about 20 times collectively throughout the movie. And I understand there are likely other major issues with the script, but seeing it just once (likely the only time I will see it) this stood out to me the most.Fifth, the year break. There is a part in the movie where the characters go about their lives with their powers for a year without showing a single second. During which, initially you had no clue what was going on, and after they described what was going on, you regretted why you wondered at all.I'm just going to end this here because I really can't stand thinking about it. I am only giving this a 4 because of the actors, they actually didn't do too terribly although it still was not my favorite showing for any of them. But Miles Teller will be a lead in other bigger movies, Kate Mara has displayed her abilities multiple times now, and Michael B. Jordan is an incredibly dynamic actor so I guarantee he will do big things in the future.All I am saying is that I heard that there was going to be a sequel to this movie, and to the writers, producers, and any one else that has to do with it, if you are going to make it like you made this one, don't.",Fantastic Four

This feels like a great build-up for the next movie and i can see a lot of promise but this movie alone wasn't good enough..I would have wanted this movie to go on for around 3 hours. That way they could have added in a little comedy, a little bonding and they should have made the fight with Doom a lot longer and a lot more interesting. I have a feeling they might make up for all of this if they actually make the second movie so..i keep my faith in the guy who brought us Chronicle.Also I don't know if everyone understood that but they tried to make it different and not follow the comics..they did however slightly follow one version which everyone seems to have forgotten.

Other reason and the better one is the main plot is not the good guys fighting for what's good, instead of that more than three quarter of the movie are from other scientist trying to figure out what happened to this four individuals and it's just the last part where it gets like the other movies.

514,grayremnant1,Those Who Cannot Remember the Past are Condemned to Repeat it,2,7 August 2015,"Well, it's been a decade since Tim Story directed his utterly abominable rendition of Fantastic Four, and after ten years Twentieth Century Fox hasn't learned a damn thing. Fantastic Four is back, and it sucks just as much as it did in 2005.Why? Because, once again, Fox has produced a film that has a promising start and quickly devolves into complete and total drivel. By the time the credits roll (if you haven't walked out of the theater by then), you will understand the breadth of this film's colossal failure.Let me start out by saying that the first half of this film is quite decent. I walked into the theater with very low expectations, and after the first 50 minutes had elapsed, I was mildly impressed with what had transpired. The acting was solid, the dialogue was well written, and the story was building in a direction that I thought was very promising.But, once the third act begins, this movie takes a polarizing turn for the worse. All the acting becomes subnormal, the dialogue turns cheesy, and the story becomes a series of loud noises and flashing lights with no discernible point or purpose. Like the 2005 version, the final battle scene is an embarrassing waste of time that lacks any cohesion or structure. It is the proverbial definition of a train that has officially gone off the rails, fallen off a cliff, sunken into a tar pit, and exploded in an atomic fireball of ruinous failure.But how did Fox mess up, yet again, for the third time in a row? Why was the third time not the charm? Because they didn't learn from their mistakes the first time around. And he who does not learn from his mistakes is doomed to repeat them over and over again. What was the mistake? It was the hiring of an incompetent director.Most comic book movie catastrophes can be traced back to one, inevitable source: a bad director with no vision and no idea of what he/she is doing. Who is the culprit this time around? That would be Josh Trank, a director who has a vast and impressive resume of timeless classics; and by that I mean a director who made Chronicle (a film with an impressive build-up and a horrifyingly awful finale) and nothing else. And guess what? Fantastic Four (2015) is a film with an impressive build-up and a horrifyingly awful finale. Sound familiar?But it's not just Trank; there's an underlying trend to be found here. The 2005 rendition of Fantastic Four (as well as its horrible sequel in 2007) was made by Tim Story, another man with an impressive resume to boast. He created such classics as Barbershop and Taxi, and by 'classics' I mean ridiculous crap-fest films with no positive attributes. See the trend? Bad directors often make bad films. Who would have guessed?Which brings us to the topic of X-Men. Remember how good X-Men and X2 were? They were awesome. That's because they were directed by Bryan Singer, who made The Usual Suspects, which was one of the best films ever made. Remember how nauseatingly awful X-Men: The Last Stand was? That's because it was directed by Brett Ratner, who made Rush Hour, which was a forgettable, mediocre piece of trash. In fact, The Last Stand was so bad that they had to rehire Bryan Singer to direct a movie that completely and totally negated the horrifying events that happened in Ratner's abomination of a film.What I'm trying to say here is that the 'make or break' for most comic book films lies in the director, and if there's one thing Twentieth Century Fox is really good at, it's picking terrible directors for their comic book films (again, with exception to Bryan Singer). Why is Fantastic Four (2015) about as terrible as Fantastic Four (2005)? Because Tim Story and Josh Trank are both in the same boat. They're both terrible directors, and they were both employed by Fox to direct terrible films.The most damning thing about Fantastic Four (2015) is the fact that it suffers from almost every negative aspect of the original (minus the excessive campiness). It has all the same hallmarks: an underdeveloped villain, a lack of structure, and a finale that I could have slept through had I not been tasked with writing this review. Oh, and did I mention the CGI is absolutely awful? It looks like they either made it with a 1 million dollar budget, or it was just simply unfinished. Either way, the graphics are dated, and it doesn't help this film's case.I think now we can officially conclude that Fox is incapable of making a successful Fantastic Four movie. They've had three chances, and they've struck out. I think it's fair to say that they now have two options: either give the rights back to Marvel, or hire Bryan Singer to direct Fantastic Four 2. Otherwise, we're just going to see the same rubbish time and time again.",Fantastic Four

522,shaun_cullen,Give me back my 90 minutes please!,2,1 October 2015,That was pretty weak. As reboots go that was a waste of time. When a reboot is no better than the original then what is the point? This wasn't necessarily dreadful but it was approaching that status. They changed to much of what was in the comic books which for the real people who support these movies who are the die hard fans of the comics then whats the point? There are so many good ideas for movies out there so in my opinion they should not make reboots anyway. A movie should get one chance to be the best it can be so if it sucked don't remake it. If the original is awesome then that's even more reason not to remake at the risk of making a lesser version which is what happens 9 times out of 10.,Fantastic Four
523,Hamlet_Archer,written by a 12 year old,3,15 November 2015,"i sometimes found myself liking movies that few others liked, and when i read reviews saying that the fantastic 4 was not the usual marvel movie, i thought maybe the low rating was a result of a decent movie marketed to the wrong audience segment. man was i wrong!the screenplay felt like it was written by a 12 year old. the monologues were cheesy in an almost comedic manner -- e.g. ""he is stronger than each one of us, but not stronger than all of us."" while the 4 stood in a circle, before an underwhelming coordinated attack quickly disposed of the villain who was dominating until a second ago.the movie ended with a debate on the name for the team, and the elastic science guy (i have already forgotten his name) had a moment of true inspiration and came up with ""fantastic 4"". i never thought much about the name before, but the movie ending moved me to wonder if such an unimaginative name should require such drama.the fantastic 4 was indeed an unusual marvel movie -- it was a bad marvel movie.",Fantastic Four
524,mman69,fantastic four = fantastic bore,2,5 August 2015,Terrible movie as previous reviewer writes the pacing is all wrong the characters are bleh you don't feel any attachment to them with them creating no chemistry.The middle section of the movie is drawn out while the climax feels rushed like the director went gosh where running out of time quick rap it up. After the recent awesome avenger movies and the Thors this felt like some hacked together 1990s offering.The story has so many gaps in it with supposedly super smart scientist doing super stupid things and Miles Teller playing Mr Fantastic is just a terrible choice he has no screen presence as a leader.

526,per-abenius,Can this movie get a lower grade than Batman & Robin? I think so...,1,12 August 2015,"So what's the plot of this 100 minute disaster? The two young scientists Ben Grimm and Reed Richards have worked one a teleporter for years and so they are appointed by one Dr. Franklin Storm to complete a so called ''Quantum Gate'' together with his children Sue and Johnny as well as Storm's protegé Victor Von Doom (I hate that name). The five youngsters succeed in trying out the teleporter which allows them to travel to different dimensions. However, the machine gives them supernatural powers. Four becomes good, one becomes evil. You know the rest.Even though this film contains good up-and-coming actors such as Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Jamie Bell and Michael B. Jordan it totally fails as a comic book movie. The plot leads up to these great and epic events and twists but they are executed terribly. You are literally sitting at the theater knowing that something bad-ass will happen and when it doesn't. And you just feel dooped. When the director of a film states to the public that the film sucks... well then you know it's gonna suck. Unfortunately this was the case with Fantastic Four. According to reports, the director Josh Trank who created Chronicle (2012), a movie I loved, had to change almost the whole script in order for it to be more ''audience-friendly''. I literally cannot understand that part. Even though I believe that a story like Fantastic Four should be more for kids than say Iron Man, I still think that it could be serious. And if Trank could have done that his way, I am certain we would have a different, better movie today. But it became serious in a pretentious way that does not work. Heck even the CGI looks terrible from time to time. How did they go wrong THERE with THAT budget.Now, the question you are all asking: ''Is it better than the 2005 movie starring Ioan Gruffud and Jessica Alba?''. Even though I absolutely hated that movie, I'll have to say yes. Because that movie didn't take itself as seriously as this one. Even the Silver Surfer is better. Jesus... Like I said in the summary, I do believe and hope that this movie gets an overall grade LOWER than Batman & Robin (1997). As much as I hate it, George Clooney's nipple suit and Arnies puns still beats this crap. Go watch Mission Impossible instead, a movie containing Tom Cruise hanging off an airborne airplane is a far better choice. Trust me.Goodnight from Sweden!",Fantastic Four
527,baseballcrw,"A messy, boring, torturous film",3,23 August 2016,"Hey, remember when we all thought that the reboot of the 'Fantastic Four' franchise would be in the found-footage format and we were all disappointed?Yeah, I'd rather see that film.This entire film is a disaster. The writing, the tone, the special effects, and the directing all contribute to the downfall of a once beloved group of characters. In fact, the only reason I gave this film TWO out of ten stars instead of one is because of the performances. You can almost feel the potential of the film coming from the young cast; Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara and Jamie Bell all give decent performances, but that aspect of the film is quickly bogged down by the atrocious writing. What were the screenwriters thinking? None of the characters have any depth and the tone is all over the place. That still isn't the worst of it though...the villain is one of the most laughable, clichéd, over-the-top characters you will ever see on the big screen. He's right up there with Arnold's Mr. Freeze and Jamie Foxx's Electro as one of the worst movie villains of all-time.In conclusion, you should not even consider watching this movie. Even if it's a rainy day and you think you've seen just about every other movie out there, re-watch one of them instead. 'Fantastic Four' is one of the worst superhero films ever made, although at least the heroes' performances are good...that's aimed at you, 'Batman & Robin'.",Fantastic Four
528,Robert_Escamilla,It is everything BUT Fantastic!,4,6 August 2015,"This movie is a huge disappointment. Nothing happens in the 1 hour 40 minutes that feels like 2 hours and a half.When the trailer came out, with a very interstellaresque look I got excited, well that's the biggest excitement this film has produced me. It lacks emotion, conflict, empathy, everything is so freaking wrong with it. The first hour and a half could have been the first 30 minutes of the film. They expended so much time in the first act that the 2nd act of the film is (invisible) and we jump directly to the 3rd act that burns into ashes without any support.Usually I try to be positive with every film and to find their good side. But in this case I'm really disappointed. The previous films, yeah those with the blonde Jessica Alba, were way more entertaining and exciting than this oneThe only good thing from it is the casting. But I can't understand why these actors accepted to be in a film with such a bad script. OK, I get everyone wants to be a super hero but not everyone gets second chances like Ryan Reynolds so they should be more careful with their choices.Maybe Stan Lee thought the same thing about it, so he decided not to do this time the now famous cameo.I don't even know if there is an post credits scene, I didn't stay. And honestly I don't care.Don't waste your money.Ps: Dear Fox, you should return to Marvel the fantastic four rights. I'm sure that even their worst version would be better than yours.",Fantastic Four

People go to an F4 movie to see (GASP!) The Fantastic Four!!!! 2) Find a good comic book storyline. They have been out there for years and years.3) Reed Richards is super smart. Sue Storm will be his wife. Johnny Storm is white...and is Sue's brother. Don't mess with that.4) I know you are looking for black audience but don't you think you could bring in one of the black heroes? I like the Black Panther. Luke Cage was great. Or create a new one! Or a cool black villain! It hacks off the purists that you messed with the story line and turning a white hero black has to feel demeaning to the black audience.5) Don't try to do too much with a reboot. Straightforward story would be best. Take a peek at Star Trek: TMP. Basically reintroduced the characters...set the scene, and replayed an established story.6) You have an hour and a half, maybe 2 hours. DON'T Try to do the whole comic book series in one movie.

The only redeeming quality is some of the visuals but sadly the story, tone, pacing, acting (aside from Michael B Jordan who always gives his all even when the movie is terrible) kill any chance of this film being taken seriously. 
The massive and obvious reshoots as well as the story that appears to have been written from a brief browse of Marvel's First Family's Wiki and you have a recipe for disaster.

Is this movie as horrifyingly bad as, say, Hot Pursuit ??? No, but by Marvel standards (Like Capt. America, Iron Man or the Avengers) is this a great movie - also NO. Now I will say that I liked the story about how the kids became their individual hero's I had no problem with the origin story part of the movie, my problems with the movie came with the very highly anti-climactic dealing with Doom. The movie didn't quite do enough to build him up, and the final battle scene was just too short and, again, anti-climactic. And I do want to mention one point here. The scene where they pulled Doom from the other dimension and they had him strapped to that table............... A little too REVENGE OF THE SITH for me (when Anakin first put on the suit) I have to ask, did anyone else get that feeling?? So, I was entertained by the origin story part of the movie, but the anti-climax of how they handled Doom made this a mediocre movie",Fantastic Four

But if they cut some scene, maybe the director's cut can save some in DVD, but it will be hard.the visual effect are good but not perfect, that a things but that all, The during is 1h40, they should 30 minutes to say everything they said in this movie, and could use an other villain than Dr. doom, we had this one twice already this was enough.

What makes the Fantastic Four so special that they are a family... however this movie falls all that. The Fantastic Four don't feel like a family, they barely feel to be even a team or group since all four are not on screen at the same time until the very end. Even the Tim Story movies and the unreleased 1994 film were able to get the family or team part right as all four were on screen at the same time much as necessary. Also it takes an hour for them to get their powers, a whole lot nothing happens as if the second act was missing, and there is only one action scene in the entire movie. This is suppose to be a superhero movies and action scenes are required. They were replaced with unnecessary boring scenes. Also the action scene against Dr. Doom just happens with no build up or reason why Dr. Doom went evil except he is the villain in the comics. Also the editing was horrible, especially Kate Mara's hair/wig. They reshoot many of the scenes as if they didn't care to be consistent with her scenes.

At the beginning and i mean the first 40 min. of the film bored me. And pretty much nothing happens. I mean the movie is predictable. I will not put spoilers in my review.

It is so far removed from the original comic book script the story was beyond a different alternate Earth. The characters weren't even two dimensional. They were one dimensional. Fox seems to have a bad history in making poor inconsistent Marvel movies and problems with continuity. Look at all the X-Men movies. Do they even know where they were going? Look what they did with Deadpool in X-men Origins. Horrendous. 20th Century Fox should give up their rights to Disney since the Avenger movies seem to be on the right page. The comics have a wealth of information and stories. Why change it when the comics knew what they were doing? No wonder Fanatic Four wasn't released on normal media outlets like other movies like Ant-Man and Avengers: Age of Ultron, or Captain America: Winter Solider.

552,galadriel3562,disappointed,4,9 August 2015,"Some of the pre-release buzz for this movie had me worried. Not releasing it to critics, or asking them to withhold their reviews speaks to me of a lack of confidence in your own work. Unfortunately, that lack of confidence was entirely deserved. Fantastic Four is a terrible movie, it's very slow to start, with very limited character introduction and almost no back story. Relationships that are pivotal – such as the friendship between Ben Grimm and Reed Richards – get all of five minutes of screen-time, which makes it very difficult to follow along with decisions made by these characters. The history between Sue Storm and Victor Doom is another such matter, a hint or two, but no explanation, no back story and therefore no motivational background for anything the characters do. The movie is relatively short, compared to some of the others in the genre, and certainly could have benefited from a bit more exposé. Unfortunately, adding more background would have further slowed down the storytelling, and it's already too slow. Too much time staring at computer screens, tinkering away and talking. And, being a scientist myself, I found myself annoyed with the 'science' in this movie. Watching a superhero movie requires a certain suspension of belief but can still be very enjoyable, prime examples of such movies are the first Avengers or the first Iron Man. But then there are movies like this, which frankly, when it comes to the science and the practice of it are on par with Prometheus (the guy making the map gets lost? Come on). One 'successful' trial run does not a safe process make, nor does it seem likely to me that a kid as smart as these characters presumably are would go around sticking his hand into a completely unknown 'alien' substance. I could go on and on about what bothered or disappointed me about this movie, suffice it to say that after having vehemently discussed all that is wrong with this movie for 45 minutes I still hadn't run out of major issues. All in all, Fantastic Four felt unfinished, ill- thought out and downright boring.",Fantastic Four
553,jedimaxhammond,How is it possible for a movie to be this bad,1,7 January 2020,"It's like they talked to a focus group who said that people want less setup and exposition and more action, and then some idiot read the results backwards. They had a movie, but then they realized it would be 3.5 hours long, so instead of doing the logical thing and cutting some of the exposition, they cut out the entire middle of the movie and added more exposition to compensate. Moreover, this movie is dumb because it reinforces the general consensus that the Fantastic Four are lame characters. We've only ever seen a silly, campy Fantastic Four, and this movie gives us the polar opposite of the 2005 movie. It takes itself way too seriously, and it was clearly only made so that Fox could keep the rights away from Marvel. On the other hand, this movie is a godsend for other terrible or mediocre superhero movies.

I much prefer the earlier movies which are much closer to the original comics and characters.I'm glad that plans for sequels seem to have been quashed!The worst part of the movie, for me, is when daddy Baxter propounds the possibility that the science that Reed and his friends are uncovering could be an answer to humanity's ills. The illusion that science will somehow fix all our woes (climate change the worst amongst them) is dangerous because it moves our focus away from the reality that we need to fix climate change by stopping using fossil fuels.

557,charzhino,Too dark for its own good,5,5 August 2015,"I went into this movie with hope and optimism and not put off by the negative light shone towards it. An hour and 40 minutes later, I left feeling empty and unsatisfied. Comic book films are supposed to make you feel inspired, but not this one. So what is wrong with it? One word – chemistry. In any superhero team/ensemble there should be great character interactions and a feeling that these guys can effectively make a team, never mind a ''fantastic'' team. The best team movies all have characters playing off each other as in the Avengers and X-Men.  However, there is zero chemistry between any of the F4. We see an attempt at some early romance between Reed and Sue which doesn't go anywhere. Johnny Storm is billed as a genius but troubled kid however we never see why he has a high IQ, he is just shifted in to make up the numbers. We never see him form any sustainable bond with any of the others. Ben Grimm also appears as an outsider, brought in with little sense to the project to fill the final slot. The chemistry between the original F4 (2005) was MUCH better whereas here they feel like 4 individuals.  The climatic battle takes place in the most boring environment that you can imagine. It is over within 10 minutes, with not much ingenuity to overcome a half decent attempt at Dr Doom, who at first seems very intimidating. This film will be quickly forgotten and the question isn't whether a sequel will be made or whether it will cross over with X-Men, but is the original Fantastic 4 film a better watch than this depressing, dull comic book movie.

I thought this might be finally a movie that is actually watchable of the 2015s, but oh boy oh boy i was so wrong. Don't get me wrong, first fantastic 4 was a bless. It was really good, but this one is just a fantastic garbage x4 . There was no chemical between the characters. Oh wait, i'm wrong, there was a little chemistry, between the rock and the gum (if i call them by name it would be an insult to the original movie). The action took to long to build up, by the time something actually happens i was so bored and i was already almost an hour into the movie? I mean come on, let's be serious, which movie takes 70% of it's time just to introduce 2 characters and nothing else? Especially when i think it's an action movie, oh it was so boring and bad. The cgi wasn't that great, the stone guy was really bad, too much detailing, the young inventor was too young obviously and why the father had to die right at the end? Just why... it wasn't his fault after all but yea, let's kill it to add a bit of drama to a puppet movie. After all i say i thought that the stones should have been more involved in the movie, but no, it appears at the beginning and at the end... Well after all this horror movie (in a bad way) i will go and re-watch the older fantastic four, where Dr reed really looks like a scientist and not some looser teenager and where the fight between Ben and Johnny is really, not just 10 second like in this one.",Fantastic Four
561,brewpub420,Umm....WTF?,3,16 May 2019,"Thought exercise. If Black Lightning became white. If Storm from the X-Men turned into a white punk chick with a mohawk. If Black Panther was played by George Clooney. If Pee Wee Herman played Shaft , people would lose their mind and scream racism and blackball whoever wrote and made it from Hollywood. So , ah , The Human Torch has been two entities over the last oh ,80 YEARS. An android that would eventually become Vision. And Sue Storm's brother. Bring in a 3rd Human Torch , say Johnny died and they found a person with nearly the same powers and I'm fine with it. The FF has had a rotation of members at times it wouldn't have been that odd. This was just pure pandering and it showed as it produced a piece of garbage.",Fantastic Four
562,james-mac,Seems like they wanted to make a different movie,4,23 May 2016,It's such a shame they didn't actually draw from the characters that are established in the comic books. The Fantastic Four comics are overflowing with wild and crazy and beautiful concepts and none of it was used in the movie. It's as if they didn't want to really make a Fantastic Four movie but had all this money and decided to make a movie about a completely different set of characters. And they once more got the iconic Dr. Doom who in many ways is the heart of the comic book series completely wrong. Why do they think that their half-baked ideas are better than those in what was one of the longest running and most original series ever published?,Fantastic Four
563,codyrmoskop,Fox and Sony execs need to let the real talent control the films,1,30 March 2021,"Once again, the clowns behind the desks made all the decisions without reading a single word of the origin material and made another abomination. 3 movies and they didn't learn anything and now the franchise is probably ruined beyond repair.

564,bevanaaron,The Time-Wasting Four,4,26 August 2015,"Admittedly, the Fantastic Four could have the potential to be a very successful and action packed movie to get everyone talking. But, on this occasion it just didn't happen. The film was setting up for a very long time which would have been acceptable had this film of been much longer. But for a film which lasted 1 hour and 40 minutes there was too much set up leaving us viewers with about 20 minutes of action. The action itself was quite entertaining which is why it got my rating of '4' however it just took too long to get there with a quite quick ending. In my opinion, a film named 'Fantastic Four'should have cut too the chase much quicker and have been filled with non-stop action and tension to grip us instead of making us wish we hadn't started watched. It began a film with so much potential but ended as a film that had no effect on me at the end.",Fantastic Four
565,mvqa,Not worth your time,4,10 August 2015,"I would not say that the movie is awful, but it is extremely boring. The first half hour is a bit entertaining, and I kinda liked the direction they where taking, but after that nothing happens, absolutely nothing!! The movie only has like 2 action scenes which feel really rushed, and the final one is quite boring as well, something you don't expect in a movie about Superheroes. There is no chemistry between the characters and the dialogs are terrible. The movie from 10 years ago is way better than this, at least in that one you get a little bit of excitement. Save your money and watch MI5 instead.",Fantastic Four
566,mister_mort,Most boring superhero movie ever,2,14 August 2015,"This movie is an abomination that anyone should avoid at any cost. No, in fact it is not one but two bad movies combined together in a 1h41 movie. Yes, a sane mind should ask himself "" How can two movies be combined into such a short lenght ?"" FOX studios, well known for having produced masterpieces like Dragonball Evolution, Elektra or Wolverine origin may have asked Godfrey Ho his secret... The first part or the mobile is a long and boring presentation. It's long, ans very Few things happened. it is what we can call "" the Josh Trank part"" Generic, looking visually more like à Nolan movie than a FF adaptation. Then, after the words "" one year later "" appeared, the action begins. Good ? Not at all ! Bad CGI and idiotic actions happening for no reason at all. Doom returns only to be defeated in rive or ten minutes. Poor Doom, Who looks Like a cross between a crash test dummy and a Schumacher version of a SM dominator. Ridiculous, like the Thing who wears no pants and has nô p#nis ta all... Add to this That the movie so cheap, and that, except Kate Mara, no one looks like the comic books character, and that neither the story nor the tone reminds or the comic, and you have a very generic, bland, âne painful movie to watch. At least Catwoman and Batman and Robin were entertaining in their own stupidity. Not the case here",Fantastic Four
567,jfsinil,Star Wars preview best part of seeing this today...,2,7 August 2015,"Film starts out with young Reed and future Thing bonding over circuit-blowing experiments in a garage. Flash forward to a high school science fair, and lo, if that isn't Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm. I like Bell, and despite the the slow beginning of this film begin to wake up and pay attention more.Of course, after the creation of the Four, guess which actor totally disappears into being the human boulder - Bell. The only actor in the movie to show a spark of ability. I can't even remember what the other actors looked like, and they got to still look like themselves when not bursting into flames or going invisible.The film moves slooowly. A lot of the scenes are just dark - I mean, is lack of lighting to hide cheap sets or what? The special effects are passable - except for Reed as Mr. Stretchy. Mrs. Incredible did it better and she was obviously a cartoon. Reed just looked a poorly drawn-out special effect trying and failing to look real.Save your money on this one - or go see Antman again. That film was FUN!",Fantastic Four
568,wendimac,Fantastic bore,1,27 August 2015,"This movie was in insulting to watch and embarrassing for anyone involved in making this movie. The only reason this movie was made is so that Fox could keep the rights to the fantastic four It was like watching a movie from made in the 1990s The characters didn't look right with each there was no emotion between them. Changing the story line so they went to another dimension instead of out the space was interesting except most of the movie was them in the lab. The most ridiculous part of this film is when they finally finish building the Teleportation device and it is decided they can't go. Reed, Victor and Johnny get drunk and decide they going to go anyway so reed calls Ben and tells him he's not going without him this was a terrific idea nothing could possibly go wrong. Things go wrong pretty quickly victor wines up falling off a cliff they get hit by this green stuff while trying to get back in the pods Sue who is helping get back is hit by a wave when they return and that is how they get their powers To be honest by this point I was really past caring. So reed escapes a year goes past They need him to fix the machine they so they send Ben after him they Catch him he fixes the machine some of the scientist goes back find victor is still alive they bring him back he starts killing people he then escapes opens a Black hole they go to get him blah blah blah the only reason you should watch this movie if he just happens to be on the telly and for some reason you can't turn the telly over or off.",Fantastic Four
569,karlosdaynjer,How did this make it to theaters?,2,1 January 2016,"I had low expectations for this movie, so if it delivered even a little bit I would have enjoyed it. Some problems have been mentioned already: The cast - too young, and poorly chosen. The guy who becomes the Thing is the smallest character? Reed is a high school nerd? Uh, no. And as sexist as this sounds, Sue should be hotter. I almost liked Johnny. Effects - some of the early flying scenes of Torch were reminiscent of the unreleased (but in some ways better) Roger Corman version that can be found on youtube. Reed and Ben construct a teleporter of some kind, but they have no idea where it goes? They've never taken soil samples, sent a digital camera or cell phone to try and see? They are possibly stupider than the last incarnation of the FF, who only caused millions of dollars of damage and endangered a few dozen human lives on a bridge on their first outing. These morons thought it would be a good idea to take a drunken excursion to another dimension, which ends up nearly destroying the planet. Also, could someone tell me how they maintained radio and video contact with the other dimension once objects were sent? There were no open portals through which signals could travel. So much wrong with this movie, and I don't have the energy or desire to rehash it here.",Fantastic Four
570,adam-65-171468,Awful .. but not in a good way,1,14 December 2015,"Let's be honest here, the 2005 Fantastic Four movie was .. OK. Silver Surfer was poor and the franchise limped off and died. Then I heard about the reboot, I saw the hype, the pictures, the posters etc. etc.. I'm not going to get into the Human Torch still managing to be Sue Storm's brother but managing to be a completely different ethnicity (the adopted Balkan war orphan explanation was one of the things that really killed the film for me) too much. To be honest it would have made more sense (and been a little braver) to have made Sue black as well - I would have respected that decision.I'm also not going to say much about the slew of high ratings that have appeared on here for this tripe besides using it as proof that there are people who do give high ratings for cash.The thing you need to know before considering watching this ... it is a very, very bad superhero movie. This isn't the charming bad where some well meaning geeks put something together on a shoestring (see most Australian horror movies). There might have been some chance if this had the feel of the comics (light-hearted, group dynamic based action) or if the characters even slightly resonated with the originals. One of the reasons why the Spidey movies worked is because they used Peter Parker well - they drew on back story already there to act as a foundation for rote character development. DC manage the same thing in the Superman movies. Nolan broke the mold with the Batman trilogy but most of these franchises have two dimensional characters everyone forgives because the comics give them depth. In this movie they managed to kill that - you end up with what I thought was impossible - a 1 dimensional set of characters.People blame Trask, say the script was no good, etc etc etc. Honestly - this is so awful everyone involved should hang their heads in shame. Things this awful aren't created by one person messing up - this takes a special team effort.",Fantastic Four
571,wkaila2001,Just awful,1,8 October 2016,This movie was just beyond awful. I was sad that the original cast was not going to play in it and did not tend to see it but i was dragged. The actors were good and the costume but the story base was horrific. I love marvel and I knew marvel did not make this movie but Fox did. There was only action in the last 15 minutes other than that nothing. It was not amusing or better as the first one in any type of way. I didn't blame Stan Lee for declining to being in the movie and he is always in one of his movies. The writer was so disrespectful to the cast members and others who help make the movie. He should not write another movie and they should not reboot Fantastic Four again. I am sorry to say this but Fantastic Four is dead and if they are making a new movie they would have to make a huge comeback from this.,Fantastic Four
572,nguyentrongnam,What happened with Dr.Doom???,1,6 August 2015,"Absolutely not recommend to see this movie. I watched it last night and I have to say this movie is such a disappointed ever. I don't know what's going on with Dr. Doom, the way Fox created him was so suck. He looks like a person who just got serious burned. He doesn't' even have any muscle as the comics. The plot is so damn sucks, 1 year after the accident in the dimension world, no character even bother to mention about him, all people in the world just focus on how to find Reed, like Van Doom is never exist in that movie...this is weird. And seriously, someone please give Ben a pants instead of showing his rock butts on the screen like that.

I will not get into details but origin stories are supposed to be less about the action and more about how these people came together, which is what this movie showed. The action is for sequels. I think the actors did great and even though I love the MCU, I think FOX is going in the right direction with the X-Men films and now the Fantastic Four is on the right track. The previous 2 entries were just horrible, and this film makes those awful memories go away. I really hope they make a sequel with the same actors because I will definitely go see it. Plus, The Thing actually looked awesome instead of a guy in a rubber suit who was still the same size as the people next to him",Fantastic Four
574,t-23546,Fantastic Four Isn't Quite Fantastic,2,7 August 2015,"Fantastic Four is directed by Chronicle's Josh Trank and stars Miles Teller, Jamie Bell, Michael B. Jordan, and Kate Mara.This is the third attempt at a Fantastic Four film within the past decade. The first two films are major disappointments to say the least. When news surfaced about a new try at the superhero squad, I couldn't help but get a little excited. Marvel fans had not seen a well done Fantastic Four movie yet. Fox-Marvel had just released a well received X-Men: Days of Future Past and it seems like the studio had everything together. With a talented cast and up and coming director working on the title, it looked as if fans would finally be treated to a good Fantastic Four movie.However, everything seemed to go completely wrong. Fantastic Four is without a doubt the worst superhero film I have ever seen. The film misses the mark on every element of a superhero flick.I was a little worried about this film after seeing how there is a ""4"" in the title, which comes off trying to be creative. Adding a number in your title is not a good sign. It may sound like a good idea at first, but in reality it actually just messes up the title. Then news dropped that there were some major controversies behind the camera making this film. This is really present in this uninspired film because it appears that no one had fun at all making this film. All the actors in Fantastic Four look as if they just want to leave the set and be done with the project. A very important goal for a superhero flick should be to make the viewer want to be the title hero; just like a kid. This makes the audience interested in the character and care about what lies ahead for the protagonist. Some of the characters in this movie are so horribly developed that no possible interest is sparked in their story arch. Speaking of story arch, I don't think there was a single one in this movie. No characters had to overcome anything or prove themselves. It is just skipped over completely by a ""1 year later"" title. Why would they do that? They complete ignored how the characters felt about their powers. The closest the film comes to that is with the Thing. Sadly, it is not investigated enough for it to be a plot point. The movie fails horribly having no real story. It's just one scene after the other of honestly nothing compelling whatsoever. The team obtains their powers and that's what the main focus of this movie really is. It's almost as if they forgot to add a threat to the movie.This leads to my next point, Dr. Doom. This villain is so horribly underdeveloped that it's almost like he is just thrown into the movie randomly. There is no motive or logic behind why he wants destruction caused. Fantastic Four is just a build up to an eventual sequel. Fox is so focused on having a strong money making franchise that they forget to make the movie actually watchable. The studio makes the mistake of not having a good beginning entry to the franchise to make an audience want to return to the world again in a sequel. It almost comes off as a parody with some horribly executed and terribly cheesy scenes. The film tries so hard to take itself seriously that its embarrassing. The movie was made just so Fox could keep the characters away from Marvel. No effort or care is put into the final product. It's sad that Fox made that clearly obvious with this dull and uninteresting superhero movie. I thought it was impossible to make a superhero movie not fun, and Fantastic Four proves me wrong.",Fantastic Four
575,lauren_leyden,A score of four is too fantastic for this movie (a movie lamer than this title)!,3,8 August 2015,"Fantastic Four (2015) was a movie purely created to either lower future expectations of Marvel Movies or make them look better than they actually are in comparison to this tragic mess. Or so I hope... To think this was created intentionally would be an embarrassment to every other Marvel movie and the Fantastic Four franchise. The pacing of this movie is horrible and not well thought out. It could metaphorically be compared to starting at Monday, waiting for the weekend, getting knocked out on Friday night, and waking up at 11:58pm on Sunday night. The amount of time wasted in this movie to get to Friday night (the major plot line) was incredibly boring and didn't contribute to character development or important story aspects at all. The movie could have literally started at Friday night and nothing else would change! When we do get to Friday night, the climatic weekend doesn't exist and you get the shortest boss fight in Marvel history at 11:58pm on Sunday night (because the weekend was a bunch of boring mush). Finally you leave the movie feeling like it's Monday again. This movie was also lamer than this metaphor. There was zero character development. There were hints there may be some relationships forming, but the writers wasted there time because they couldn't be bothered developing these hints to ""go"" anywhere. As insulting as this may sound, Twilight for once was a better love story! And yes, this movie was lamer than Twilight. The actors and actresses were completely wasted in their potential. Their characters lightened up during these brief moments that went know where, but it didn't take long for them to return to a state more jaded than Daria, but without her great anti-social and sarcastic finesse! I hope their careers aren't ruined because of a terrible script that didn't give them opportunity. The main characters were also pushed aside in the movie to create room for fitting in stupid, nameless characters with no common sense we love to hate. With the first Fantastic Four movies, as much as you love or hate them, there were at least focuses on the major Heros. There were zero connections to these characters in this version as the writers, to put simply, offered no opportunity. To summarise, this is the word Marvel movie in history, it's ruined everyone involved, it's not worth seeing, and you'll be better off staying at home with your cat who might do something interesting and become an Internet sensation. An Internet sensation that will earn more views on YouTube than the gross profit of this terrible movie. A movie lamer than this review!",Fantastic Four
576,antoninusjohnson,Fantastic update on the original,8,10 August 2015,"This was a more grown up Marvel film although not strictly produced by Marvel but by Fox.At first I was unsure of the actors chosen for the parts but when you watch the movie they work really well together. Mara and B Jordan put in some great performances.Some of the plot and characters are different to the original comic book Johnny Storm is black in the movie whereas he is white in the comic's. There is nothing unusual about this change. I am a fan of Battlestar Galactus and Boomer was originally played by a black man only to be replaced by the beautiful Ms Parks in the new series who is female and Asian. The Thor the movie is different from the comic. In the comic Thor always wears an helmet and transforms into Dr Blake which is not the case in the movies There is less action in this movie compared to other comic movies like Iron Man 3 which is the worst Marvel movie devoid of any any reality, a leave your brain at home movie, action is there for action sake not to advance the story.This film gives you gradual build up of excitement little teasers providing you with a snapshot of each character and how they get to where they are, reaching a big explosion of excitement and action at the end.The characters are more believable. The Thing looks like the Thing instead of a man in a bodysuit.The special effects was good but not something you hadn't seen before.Very few negatives with the film could have been a little bit longer with more action.But overall this is a very good, enjoyable movie, a thinking man's movie. I can't wait to see it on Blue Ray and the forth coming sequel.",Fantastic Four
577,sidneyfault,Beyond terrible,1,29 March 2019,"This film is is a complete and epic failure.Nothing about this film or characters was even remotely true to anything Marvel ever created. This film was made by people who don't understand the genre or how passionately people care about the characters they butchered.This was only made so the rights wouldn't default back to Marvel.
No other reason. The deal Fox had with Marvel stated that they had to produce a film every so many year or the right to the franchise would default back to Marvel.
This film was only made because of that. They didn't care if they where even close to capturing the spirit of the comic or the characters. Which they missed entirely.Thankfully this missed the mark so badly that there will never be an attempt to modernize or recreate Marvel's first family of super heroes.This isn't even worth watching on netflix or cable. Save yourself the agony and wait till Marvel does something wonderful with this now that the right are back in their hands with the Disney purchase of Fox.",Fantastic Four
578,joelacunaisawesome,Worst movie of the year!,1,14 December 2015,"When I first saw the trailer for the movie I had pretty high hopes for it being at least mostly decent. Then I saw the movie. It was awful. I really disliked how they developed the characters from the moment they showed their grown up scenes. When they were kids they had more development with those scenes. When they got to the other world to get their powers it was really stupid. How Susan got her powers was completely stupid as well. If i recall in the comics Susan went to the other world but in this one she some how gets her powers from a shock wave which goes everywhere and somehow she's the only one effected? How does that make sense? Then they somehow need their suits now to control their powers? There is almost no training to get use to their powers this time around. The over all premise of the F4 working for the government is not shown unlike in the trailers where they are shown going on missions, that is all cut from the movie and lost. What made this worse was that Reed left his team for a year and then somehow everyone is magically okay with it and happy when he is brought back? How is that at all something to be okay with? Then Dr. Doom is somehow alive in the other world for over a year with nothing at all shown how he survived? How did he survive? His powers make no sense, he can stare at people and they blow up but when he does his big fight he has to point in a direction to fight and somehow lost the ability to make people explode? If he can blow up people while walking then he can blow up the really useless F4. Over all this movie was really really shitty and I hope that they don't go through with their plans on a sequel and cross-over with X-Men.",Fantastic Four
579,DTHCinema,Anything But Fantastic,1,3 September 2016,"Fantastic Four (or as many call it Fant4stic) is a comic book movie starring Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell, Directed by Josh Trank, was produced by Twenty-First Century Fox, and has the run-time of 100mins (1hr40mins).This is the 4th movie (and 3rd theatrical one) in the Fantastic Four Franchise. Now despite the hate i actually liked the last 2 movies in the franchise (Fantastic Four 2005 and Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer, please don't kill me). Now this Movie has been out for almost a year now but has still been getting much hate. To prove my point I would just like to say the movie has a 9% on Rotten Tomatoes which is tied for the worst rated superhero movie of all time. Let me just say I am NOT a professional critic, I just go to movies to have a good time(as shown with my liking of the old Fantastic Four movies) not necessarily to look for major flaws. However this movie makes that goal rather insufferable. Anyways here it is. A lot of people give a pass to the acting simply because these actors have done good work in other movies. Personally I find this to be a terrible excuse. All of these actors such as Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller just seem like they have no soul throughout the entire movie. It's almost as if the whole time these actors had been forced into making this movie. Also the chemistry between them is just awful.Now let's talk about the pacing. Simply put it I have no idea what they were thinking. Why would you make a Fantastic Four movie and have them do absolutely nothing the whole time except for that horrendous fight at the end. Now let me just say Superhero movies without much action can be done well (Batman, X-Men: First Class, etc.) but if your going to do that you have to having interesting conversations and a good origin story which this movie does not have in any way.Speaking of origin stories, am I the only one who almost hated the first half as much as the second half. I mean I know a lot of people who say that the first half is pretty good and all I have to say is how. It's just a drawn out, overly dark useless story that EVERYBODY knows.Then there's the tone, which let my question why did they think that make a dark and gritty reboot of Fantastic Four would be a good idea. Again let me just say, a darker story of a previously existing light heart movie isn't necessarily bad. But it has to have more reason then some executive saying ""Hey The Dark Knight was popular let's make this just like that.""Then there's the part I was most regretting talking (or writing) about the Action and Effects. Let's get out of the way that Dr.Doom and CGI Miles Teller Face is awful. What I wanted to talk about was the action sequences (or just the 1 action sequence). To be honest it's the most cliché, predictable fight ever. Basically what happens is that Dr.Doom makes this ray thing that shoots into earth from the planet he's in and The Fantastic Four have to stop him. So they go into the other planet and try to fight off Dr.Doom separately and fail so they decide to team up and defeat him. What I hate about this fight (aside from it's predictable nature) is that the whole scene is shot in extreme darkness plus it's all out of frame so you can barely tell what's going on.Last, I would like to quickly mention the forgettable score, the incredible amount of plot holes such as Dr.Storm going to a science fair for some reason, Dr.Doom magically making a cape, and Dr.Doom looking at people and killing them but not doing that for the Fantastic Four. Also just to say it is incredibly obvious Fox wanted to make some sort of MCU with this movie and set up an entire expanded universe around this movie when it cannot hold it's own weight as a good movie to do something like that.ConclusionNow as you could probably tell I do not like this movie, it has awful pacing, terrible effects,a rehashed story,and laughably bad action. While many have pointed out that Fox took over the project and made it a generic superhero movie. I agree with that but I still don't think the part that wasn't taken over was even passable. It was just Josh Trank redoing the exact same plot as the 2005 version but slower. But the worst part is that the whole movie is just a set up for more Fantastic Four movies with a set up scene every 5mins. This movie has been called by many the worst superhero movie ever and I will personally agree with that. At least Batman and Robin had an overly joking theme and never took itself seriously unlike Fant4stic which thinks it is going to be the Next Iron Man which could never happen because Iron Man actually made a good movie before setting things up. Overall i think the movie has too many problems to count such as bad pacing, no structure, and awful effects to even be close to recommending.Rating1/10Unwatchable",Fantastic Four

So, I was so excited to see the movie. When I finally watched it, my excitement for it completely went away. The trailers for it were so good. The movie however, was not. The movie was absolutely terrible. Most of the damn scenes in the trailers weren't even in the movie. The main villain didn't have that much screen time, the humor in the movie wasn't even funny, and the acting was......meh, the characters weren't even that likable. They even asked Stan
Lee to do a cameo in this movie. I'm glad he refused to be in this pile of crap. For me, the good things in this movie was the soundtrack, and CGI. The soundtrack is pretty good, and the CGI is at least decent. But overall, this movie had so much potential, but it was such a massive disappointment.

As someone who grew up on Mystery Science Theater I was looking forward to a total garbage movie, and boy did this deliver.The first thing that bothered me about this movie was that although it tossed around a lot of science terms thrown around, there wasn't even anything remotely believable about the science. It was like they didn't consult any actual scientists, but just wrote the scenes using a bunch of jargon in an attempt to sound cool.Then there is the choice to make the Fantastic Four high school kids. Who made that decision? There is no reason for them to be 18/19 years old.But the biggest problem is that the movie lacks a plot. It literally does not have a much of a story at all. All that happens is they get their powers, barely anything else. They have a brief clash with Doom, but that's it. There is no build up, there is not tension. This movie is truly terrible.",Fantastic Four

Such a pretty woman, with a beautiful smile.I see there are a lot of negative reviews for this film. I thought that the film was overall OK. It seems that the main issue was that they spent so much time developing the idea of the film, that the point of it and the action stuff was squeezed towards the end and somewhat rushed. Had the film been longer, the people who mainly expect to see much more of the usual smashing and murder would probably have been more satisfied (however that isn't my kind of thing).6.5/10 for the film. 10/10 for Kate (kiss kiss - even though her acting in this film was average, that didn't matter too much ;-)Summary: watch it if you also admire Kate. :-)",Fantastic Four
590,liamtoh007,Some Free Advice (and worth every penny),6,16 August 2015,"The few people who wasted 100 minutes and valuable popcorn dollars on this $120 million sleeping pill already know just how bad this anomaly is, it's my desire here to warn all the others before they suffer the same fate. Just where did that $120 million production budget go? The effects were extremely lackluster, the script was woefully amateurish, and the acting was I suppose, about the best you can expect when you are handed garbage like this. What you end up with is a terribly uninteresting and excruciatingly slow ride with zero payoff. At least the previous 2 films (flawed as they were) had a discernible plot, and a spirit of fun. Imagine this movie as a very very long walk down a dark hallway. You reach a room at the end, only to flip on the light switch and find it empty. Pathetic.As a long-time fan of these characters I can say without hesitation that these four characters (five if you count Doom) resemble the comic book characters only on a superficial level. If Fox (or later Marvel, let's hope!) wants a profitable and entertaining franchise they need to go to the source material that made these characters great to begin with. Luckily I can help them right here. What you want is a trilogy of films. The first feature, running about 2.5 hours would adapt the actual back stories of Doom and the FF found in the following comics, Fantastic Four (1961) #1 and 11 (origin portions only), the Doom back-up origin story in FF Annual 2. Any competent screenwriter would be able to tweak or update what's lacking in these early books. The second half of this movie could then adapt FF 39-40, a critically acclaimed classic. As for the sequel you need look no further than the ""Unthinkable"" storyline from FF 496-502. Finally, the last film in the trilogy would give us a faithful adaptation of the Galactus / Silver Surfer trilogy found in FF 48-50. This last one would then also give the filmmakers an opportunity to spin-off a series of Surfer movies starting with adapting Steve Englehart's great take on the character from 1987's Silver Surfer #1. The comics referenced above are classics which have stood the test of time, and if adapted wisely would practically guarantee success.",Fantastic Four

I thought because I had low expectations for this movie, it may be worth the cinema ticket, no. I have no idea where the budget went. It really felt like a Power Rangers movie, even that would have done it justice. For some reason they just direct it towards children.There really wasn't anything I enjoyed about this movie, I would prefer to watch the 2005 and 2007 Fantastic Four movies again.

Which were fine, and more in tune with the times. It also made me feel like this was new and potentially exciting.Unfortunately it never led anywhere. By the time they get their powers little of the film remains, and things after that feel rushed and lack credibility. Reed Richards' character acts particularly odd, specially for those used to the comics. Also, the villain's actions made very little sense to me, as well as his powers. Avoiding spoilers, at one point he is apparently stranded, and the next minute he is basically omnipotent.Sue was the nicest character for me, and much smarter than the comic book version. Ben was alright, as was Johnny. Reed seemed off. Doom, despite being miles away from the comic, was pretty interesting.There's very little action in this film, and the final battle is rushed and uninteresting.

Sue,Reed and Johnny are all highly intelligent students at the Baxter Building ,a think tank / school for scientifically gifted young adults. They embark on a quest to discover a new world which of course ,goes awry.This film gives the series a more professional tone to the characters and avoids what the first Fox films failed at. This 2015 film treats the characters in a realistic light,making Sue a respected ,intelligent and caring person,Johnny is reckless but dedicated when a goal is before him, and Ben Grimm reacts to his changes in a much more morose manner. Reed Richards is a wide eyed kid amazed by discovering he is not alone and there are other intellects like his.A good remake that takes a different take to the superhero film genre.",Fantastic Four

598,captshubick,Nonsensical origin story,3,10 September 2015,"Firstly, I object to the theme that anyone who chooses to defend the United States is some sort of dupe. This film makes no bones about characterizing anyone who joins or serves the military is a fool in the thrall of evil bloodthirsty bastards. I confess, that there were officers that I would follow through fire, but most I would just push in. but make no mistake; I and many of my brethren would happily use whatever powers we found extradimensionally to kill as many of the enemy as possible. The ""Fantastic Four"" are liberal pussies. If you resent the idea of service to your country, this is the film for you. No doubt Michael Moore gave it two thumbs up.I won't bore you with the bad science. Other than a passing reference to quantum entanglement(a term they didn't even bother to use), the science was not sufficiently accurate to allow one to suspend disbelieve.

The film was incoherent and bad played by the actors.20th Century Fox should sell the film rights to Disney, so that the Marvel universe could coexist together.

601,siriusgray,Fantastic Flaws,4,11 August 2015,"I went to see this movie because I was curious to know exactly why it had been so poorly received by film critics. Basically, the movie has an adequate first act with the introduction of Reed Richards as a brilliant youth and the telling of the events that then led to him and four other humans being given super powers during an ill conceived venture into another dimension. However, once the characters receive their powers, the film's plot essentially collapses with a nearly non-existent middle act and a very brief and incredibly underwhelming final act. The most interesting aspect regarding this movie's performance is the blame game currently taking place with the two main parties receiving blame being director Josh Trank and Fox Studios. After watching the film, it is clear that the blame should fall on whoever was responsible for writing/planning/editing the film's second and final acts and then those who approved those acts. What is most frustrating is that based on the film's first act, it appears that in the beginning, somebody did have the goal of making a good although very different Fantastic 4 movie than we had previously seen. However, at about the time Reed escapes and the moves jumps forward 1 year, any notion of a good film was thrown out the window and instead the movie's only objective became to introduce and defeat the Big Bad (Dr. Doom) in the quickest manner possible and to call it a day.Watching this film is mostly a frustrating experience as it is greatly unfulfilling to watch a talented cast struggle through such a mediocre script barring the film's first act. With a brisk running time of 100 minutes, the film is simply too short to succeed in telling a satisfactory story especially when more than half of that time is spent leading up to the characters receiving their powers. Obviously, the film is only able to achieve its short running time by essentially compressing its middle act into a few scenes that entirely skip over the characters reacting to their new powers and more importantly, ever bonding as a team. In fact, other than Richards, the other 3 Fantastic 4 members hardly every communicate with one another during the entire film. The short running time and the weak script is especially damaging given that it results in a film with essentially no character development between any of the characters and the film's villain which is a problem considering that the film's primary goal is for its characters to become a team and to defeat said villain. It is honestly difficult to judge the 5 main characters' acting performances as they are given so little to do in the movie and there is no point discussing any other actors in the film as they do not even qualify as being 2 dimensional.Overall, it seems that the original goal of the film was to tell a re-imagined grittier and more realistic version of the comic-based characters receiving these incredible powers and then learning to cope with these powers but then at about halfway along the way, somebody (Fox presumably) wanted this movie to be a conventional superhero movie with special effects and a big fight scene but had no clue on how to write and execute such a story from the page to the screen. The end result is a movie with a perfectly enjoyable albeit quiet first act and then a jumble of scenes and a few average special effects that someone thought could be considered the middle and final acts of a movie. I encourage anyone interested in film making to see this film as it will make one appreciate the value of a good script and the importance of proper pacing and character development. A movie without these elements simply feels like a series of disconnected scenes that prevents the viewer from ever becoming engaged with the film's characters and their fates. There were instances of potential throughout the film (Richard and Ben's relationship, Richard meeting Sue and Victor, a couple of funny one-liners, a decent score) but in the end, none of these moments amounted to anything as at a certain point the movie stopped caring about its plot and characters and only cared about reaching the finish line and setting up a sequel that is very unlikely to ever see the light of day.On a final and lighter note, seeing somebody watch a computer monitor is not an action scene despite what this movie would like us to believe.",Fantastic Four
602,drealinberg-464-848725,"Oh... well that was... bad, it was bad",1,29 December 2015,"I'm going to cut right to the point... The first portion of the movie is extremely slow and nothing happens. They get to this other dimension and all hell breaks loose and the four mc's get powers. When they cut to one year later, it looks like it could have been five years later, so it made no sense that so much could have changed in the time span of ONE year. It becomes utterly, depressingly and horrifically dark from there as Doom who they thought died comes back and kills a bunch of people. The ending and battle with Doom was so rushed, it felt like the director forgot he couldn't make the movie three hours long. While the original movies weren't very good either, at least they were a little fun to watch. This one was lackluster in every sense, and much too dark.",Fantastic Four

I was not able to tell is it half of movie or end . At the end it was all so short , like TV show , i see even here it says 100 min duration, but movie i was watching was more like 75 min, which is way to short for this kind of movie.

604,anjali-mohindra,Interesting but deeply flawed,5,7 August 2015,"While the movie had lazy action scenes and a time consuming back story it did manage to interest me.I really applaud the person who came up with the rethinking of the original back story of the Fantastic Four. It certainly made the movie a whole lot more engaging and to some extent let off the errors of this movie. Another positive thing about this movie was that it was much more darker than the 2005 movie although I don't think this tone was fitting for the the characters and their powers.In terms of acting it was adequate. I especially enjoyed Miles Teller as Mr Fantastic whom I had low expectations of. Fox did certainly choose a wide variety of talented individuals. I preferred to see a younger version of the Fantastic Four.Now while I enjoyed the movie, that didn't stop me forgetting the major flaws.Fantastic Four had a running time of 106 minutes but 2/3 of it was the origin and the experiment meaning only 1/3 was the Fantastic Four in action. I strongly disliked this decision as I paid £10 to see the Fantastic Four not their dimension traveling machine. Unfortunately characters like the Thing and Victor Von Doom didn't receive enough screen time despite their significance. Jamie Bell, who is known for the playing the the title role in Billy Eliot managed to become likable although not as nearly as funny or immerse as Michael Chiklis's portrayal of the Thing. However I enjoyed Victor Von Doom's portrayal at the beginning of the movie though I wish we saw more rivalry between Reed and Victor. Sadly as Victor became Doctor Doom, Toby Kebells portrayal was truly doomed. It wasn't really Toby's fault but the directors and writers.Nevertheless the costume department need to be sacked for their poor effort. Doom looked like something out of an 1970s Doctor Who episode despite it's £120 million budget.The worst bit of this film was the truly dreadful fight scene near the end. It lasted for about 2 minutes. Doom was portrayed as an unstoppable villain who easily exterminated everybody yet all 4 of team managed to easily kill him without being harmed.Whilst the cast seem quite friendly off screen, there wasn't enough of a chemistry between the Fantastic Four. Ben Grimm and Reed Richards really didn't seem to know each other that well and Sue and Johnny felt more like awkward relatives than brother and sister.A aspect of the story that I felt was stupid was the fact that Sue didn't actually join the team at first on the expedition and only received her powers through a explosion. This felt unnecessary. Please note I'm not a professional and most likely don't know what I'm talking about ;)",Fantastic Four

Why not skip the cinema's and sell it on DVD immediately? To start with the actors: I don't know who the casting did, but that agency must have been briefed wrong. Or they made a mess out of it. One day after seeing this movie, I can't remember the faces of the main characters, let alone their performances. There was no chemistry between them, no appearance, nothing. Then the story itself. What story? As I left the cinema, I was thinking: what did I just see? A 4 year old child could have made this up. Although, I'm insulting 4-year-olds now with this remark. The story was more empty than any dimension the Fantastic 3, 4 or 5 could have traveled to. I saw the movie won 1 award so far. I can't imagine it will win many more, although I'd like to nominate one scene from this movie for the 'worst movie scene in 2015' award (a Razzie?).

607,blessedtoes-637-715031,I get all the complaints but am hopeful,6,7 August 2015,"MILD SPOILERS INCLUDED.I'll start by saying I worked in entertainment for almost 2 decades and that despite being a comic book fan growing up I never read FF. I also didn't think the 2005 version was as bad as most people thought it was, but again didn't know the source material to feel violated.A few comments to add to all the (redundant) complaints others have mentioned.First, who cares if they change a character's race. Along the same line many are complaining about Reed being portrayed as a nerd - I didn't get that at all. Just because he was smart didn't make him a dork. What WAS a problem with him was his out-of-nowhere becoming a badass in the middle of the fight when the more experienced Thing was down. Didn't work.Second, while my experience was that the lack of chemistry was the biggest issue, I know that can also come from crappy editing. Given the bad pace of the movie I tend to suspect this. Ultimately, of course, it's the director's fault.Third, one of the biggest problems I had was a result of bad trailers and the abrupt ending of the movie. There were scenes in the trailers that seemed to show them, as a team, on some sort of a mission - something about Thing diving out of a helicopter while Reed estimated his landing time. Imagine my surprise when the movie stopped short WITH NO MISSION. I half wondered if there was another half-hour of movie after the credits. So take everyone else's shock with the sudden, anticlimactic ending and double it for me.I will stay hopeful for the sequel since Fox will most assuredly can Trank. And because I like these actors and want to give them a shot.",Fantastic Four
608,engrymfilm,expectations... I'm smarter than this but I still fell for it,1,6 August 2015,"I'm a white, 35 year old man-child and when I heard they were trying to reboot my favorite childhood superhero team of all time you can bet I turned right to my waifu body pillow, Shoko and expressed my absolute disgust about it all. They haven't gotten it right in the movies yet and now they want to do it again? I went on for 3 hours about my undying love (since childhood, I might add once again) I have for these characters that aren't simply characters but people I feel I have known all my life and can relate to. I even went straight to my own personal collection of Fantastic Four comics and explained to Shoko why these stories still spoke to countless adults like me. Like in issue 45 when The Thing gets turned down from a carnival ride because he exceeds the maximum weight requirements due to his heavy, rock formed mutated appearance. I told Shoko countless times how I've been turned down from rides because I weighed over 300 pounds or in Issue 117 when the Human Torch feels even amongst his own teammates that he is alone with his powers and how I connected because I feel the same way when I see a girl walk away from such a nice, caring and respectful individual such as myself only to see her go with the jerk who's only interested in one thing.Shoko agreed with me but she also calmed me down and told me to take a couple of very deep breaths in her bosom while she stroked my brony tail. So I settled down and I waited calmly and quietly using my training as a certified Kenpû meditation therapist from when I was in my 20's to instill patience. That is until this week... I managed to get tickets for a preview screening for Shoko and I and last night was the night where I would play Judge, Jury and Gentleman. I would try very hard to give this a chance because I was raised to be the polite thinker as opposed to the brutish neanderthal but if push comes to shove my intellect will show its true face.First thing's first, before I left the house I stared ever so thoughtfully into my closet at the various array of Fedora's I own. Each one has its own meaning and ability for different situations. If I am casually strolling the streets of the town square for an afternoon bite to eat at the local Korean owned Sushi spot (Shoryuken makes the best yellowtail btw) and just want to peruse the strip malls I will wear the classic black ""Bogart"" along with my cargo shorts and pin striped button down. It's purely for style reasons since I am casually out and about but also to attract the gazes of the numerous women I see as if to say ""you can look but please, don't touch"". But a real dame would know that. Tonight I decided upon the grey and black sashed ""Elliot Ness"" because I was on my way to do business. I was about to walk into a potentially dangerous situation with what could be the worst film I have ever seen. But this particular Fedora symbolizes tact and intelligence to win battles and so armed with my ""Thinking cap"" and Shoko, always dressed to the nines, I was on my way to the ball.And here we are. I cannot convey more fervent disappointment for something that I hold so dear to my heart. For easily 90% of the movie I rested one of my chins on my palm with my elbow on the armrest analyzing, organizing and processing each and every bit of dialogue and action. This isn't the same Fantastic Four I grew up with, this was for the audience that craves and consumes your typical alpha misogynist ""bang, bang things go boom"" blockbuster with absolutely no respect to the source material. At a certain point I couldn't even be mad anymore because this was all a joke. And so I even started to giggle here and there, very audibly in a snarky tone to show everyone around me that I was smart enough to get the joke that it was so bad. Of course no one else was laughing except for Shoko and I but, like any true man of his word and honor I saw it through to the end. On the way out I expressed to Shoko how all my worst fears had come true and how I would complain no further because even the greatest of Generals in the History of battle admit defeat when they know it has come. Shoko reassured me it was okay and I was still a good husbandu and even though some may see me as judgmental, immature and closed minded like I do my peers, my expectations here were not unrealistic. My waifu told me how my expectations echo a true lost art of being the nice guy and with it comes a superior set of standards when it comes to interests, hobbies and fighting the ever growing problem of men who are jerks and can't see a woman other than an object and only those who are intelligent will be able to see that. I'm glad I have my waifu. She is my idea of the perfect woman. Overall I do not recommend this movie for the true nerds like myself out there. If you have any class at all you will avoid this movie and save yourself the thinking power for when a true conflict arises such as Religion or promiscuity.",Fantastic Four

Clearly the reviewers rating this one star have never seen a truly god awful movie and I have seen so many bad movies it's ridiculous. First of all, this is not a prequel which is what I first thought since it's based on the same four people (different actors) as young adults in college, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, Reed Richards, and Ben Grimm. This movie is another telling of the first Fantastic Four made in 2005 and has nothing to do with that movie or the second one Silver Surfer. Based on that alone I'm sure there will be a second one with these same actors but there's no relation between this and the 2005 movie of the same name.

The first 1/3rd was decent, but after the Fantastic Four (which consists of Reed Richards, Ben Grimm, Sue Storm & Johnny Storm) achieve their powers, they do not use it for any good until the climax (which some might have fallen asleep from by then). Aside from a nonsensical plot, the performances from the cast consisting of Miles Teller (Andrew - Whiplash), Jamie Bell (Tintin - The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn), Kate Mara (Zoe Barnes - House of Cards), Michael B. Jordan (Steve Montogmery - Chronicle) and Toby Kebbell (Koba - Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) are passable, but the characters, err...Following this, Toby Kebbell's performance of Doctor Doom was passable, but the character was far off from the comics (I mean really, immediate kills from five feet away, come on!).I'm sorry, Josh Trank. You might have done a fantastic (no pun intended) job on Chronicle, but Fantastic Four is just not ready to be Fantastic. If anything, this should be the Terrible Four by now.Pros: Stellar Performances from Main Cast, First 1/3rd was half decentCons: Nonsensical Plot, Terrible Climax, Doctor DoomOverall it is a 3 star film, but just for some intended puns, i'll give it an extra star.",Fantastic Four
614,johnnycarrot7,I walked into this knowing it was gonna suck.,2,10 August 2015,"this is a review with spoilers so you'd only get most of it if you watched the movie but if you didn't see it who cares it sucked. I went to see it cuz I love superhero movies and was excited to see it even though I knew it was tanking but whatever wasted 9 bucks but ate some quality Moe's nachos.OK let me start off by saying I only gave this movie a 4/10 because one of the only good things about it were the actors (Miles Teller, Michael B Jordan and Kate Mara and whoever played Dr Doom) who are amazing actors but couldn't even lift the movie to anything over the line of ""worth wasting money on."" I went and saw this with my cousin and brother who I see every superhero/marvel avengers movie with. let me say it was god awful. the thing (lol get it) that bothered me the most was the one part of the trailer that got me pumped to see this was the part where they drop The Thing from a plane and he falls from the sky in that cool like superman looking way. guess what. it doesn't happen. and there are no action or fight scenes. a superhero movie without fight scenes? here are their ""versions"" of fight scenes: The Thing punches a tree, Mr Fantastic slaps a couple dudes, and at the so- called climatic ending which was anything but climatic, while the F4 are trying to stop Doom from doing whatever the hell he was doing, he like just pushes them away. then the movie kinda just ends. it was a HUGE disappointment. when this trailer was released I was like ""ya I guess this looks pretty good it's got a pretty good cast and Doom looks really cool."" well the only good parts of this movie were the following: 1. Doom looks pretty cool 2. the cast 3. Reed and Ben's (hardly developed) relationship (but it was still OK) 4. the origin was very cool and how they got their powers was creative I will admit but that's it. 5. Doom makes people's heads explode 6. how they thought of the name was OKAY. 7. Reed shape shifts... once... but I'm happy he actually does that in the movies nownow here's everything that sucked: 1. no fight scenes 2. human torch CLICKS A BUTTON TO TURN FIREY. like really?!?! all he's supposed to do is say flame on!!!! 3. they were locked in a facility for a year to learn their powers like really 4. the ""they belong to the government"" aspect 5. the stuff from the trailer doesn't happen like the Thing scene I mentioned earlier and the part where Reed asks Doom what's coming and he says ""answers"" or ""doom"" or whatever it varies through trailers but who gives a crap cuz it doesn't happen 6. the ugly guy who plays Dr Allen whatever he's AWFUL but Doon kills him at the end so I was minorly satisfied 7. every part of the trailer you thought was exciting is actually dumb in the actual movie 8. hate to be that guy but avengers movies are the best aka marvel studios movies I live by them, and this wasn't one, so there's a problem right off the bat 9. the tag line was ""change is coming."" ya nice tag line 10. the suits. don't even get me started 11. The Thing is naked 12. the fact that I'm still writing about what I didn't like 13. the review from Hollywood reporter or whatever said it was a ""100 minute trailer for a movie that never happens"" and that I agree with 14. no climax. at least what they tried to put as a climax could've been used as like a halfway point for the movie that's how stupid it was 15. why was Doom evil? who knows 16. it was not exciting at all. I sat there eating Moe's chips and queso the whole time 17. no end credit scene. not that it really matters but the movie was awful at least give us SOMETHING to look forward to for the next movie that hopefully is not a bust like this one 18. the pace is way too slow like stuff will happen then it goes back to nothing 19. all the F4 movies have been about was ""how are we supposed to fix ourselves?"" how bout instead of worrying about that for 100 minutes you just be superheroes? 20. Reed shouldn't have been disqualified from the science fair. just saying. 21. oh yay Baxter building! oh wait the movie takes place in some unknown area we couldn't care less about where nothing happens. 22. Johnny and Dr Storm playing the blame game come on get over it 23. I really don't know what else I can say. it was just not goodthe movie in general was terrible. to bring in an old non-marvel marvel movie, I liked Spider-Man 3 but I hated one part of it when Tobey turned all emo and annoying and walked down the street with unwanted swagger. I hated that part. that's like this movie. except it happens THE whole entire time. it's really bad. and the director can say whatever he wants about how he planned to have tons of action and his version of the movie was better ya BS if that's what happened then sue Fox. I'm just waiting for Deadpool and Civil War.thank you for your time. Fox, I hope you read this. thanks for nothing. thank you for disappointment. this film had so much potential. you're like Tim Riggins from Friday night lights. honestly.",Fantastic Four
615,ajetunmobimoji,I loved this film.,10,5 August 2015,This contemporary re-imagining of the Fantastic Four should be a box-office hit and a critical success because it is a 'fantastic' movie. The chemistry in this film was great between Miles Teller and Kate Mara. Michael B Jordan played a great Johnny Storm and once you see this movie you'll love him. Jamie Bell was a good Ben Grimm although a tad sidelined he was great and his change to The Thing is phenomenal. One character that particularly stood out to me as a standout was Toby Kebbell as Doctor Doom. I loved his egotistical portrayal as one of my favourite comic book villains. The visuals in this are outstanding and I love the way each of their powers are shown in this film. The epic showdown leaves you wanting more and it was amazing to see all of the Fantastic Four take down their powerful enemy Doom. The background score is great. Josh Trank made a great film and I really do suggest that you go to the cinema watch this film and enjoy it.,Fantastic Four
616,natethegreatman2870,Fantastic Four!,5,12 August 2015,"Okay, I'd just like to take a moment and tell you first off that anyone who says this movie is bad, or isn't like a good superhero movie they're right. BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT BEING SUPER! I LOVED Fantastic Four! Because I had read reviews about it being ""awful"" ""reboot rubbish"" ""Fantastic Flop"". I was unhappy when I heard that people didn't like this movie so I said to myself ""Hmm... if it's that bad I shouldn't see it."" but I did. And I'm more than happy I did! My advice to you is this: When you watch this movie, watch it as if you're not actually in the movie or trying to relate to one of the characters like in X-Men, or The Avengers. This isn't a team, this is a family that has to face the odds and come together through thick and thin. This movie has it's faults, but doesn't every movie? You can't please everyone, so I say go see this movie and see Marvel's first superhero family reborn.",Fantastic Four
617,macdog17,Fantastically Misunderstood,8,11 August 2015,"I'm a little flabbergasted by the amount of chagrin this film has engendered. Going in I was expecting an unmitigated disaster comparable to ""The Happening"" but instead I got one of the most interesting Marvel movies released so far.This a genuinely daring reboot, a film willing to explore the horror of having your body irreparably altered due to a terrible mistake. Pain and guilt and the reconciliation of these emotions are at the heart of this film and it's not often you can say that about a comic book adaptation.After building what he thinks is a teleporter wunderkind Reed Richards is swiftly enlisted into the Baxter Institute by Dr. Franklin Storm after they meet at a science fair. Storm explains he has actually forged an inter-dimensional transporter and together with Storm's children, Sue and Johnny, and irascible former employee Victor they build a device that can facilitate the transportation of living matter to the new dimension.During a drunken celebration of their achievement Victor slyly inveigles Reed and Johnny into joining him as the first human party to explore the new world. Reed calls on his old friend Ben who has supported him since they were children and together they venture forth into a planet that resembles a nascent Earth. Victor is entranced by an energy pocket and places his hand inside causing tectonic activity and eruptions. Sue realises what they are up to just in time to save them but she is caught in an explosion when they return.What follows is a completely different take on the acquisition of ""powers"" than any ever before portrayed in the Marvel Universe. The doleful depiction of Ben (""The Thing"") is both poignant and resonant. Reed's guilt, Sue's paranoia and Johnny's eagerness to ""become"" a weapon are equally jarring.This is not a flawless film but it is memorable, no more so when Victor returns as a villain of pure monomaniacal malice. Modern cinema needs people like Josh Trank. I pray this won't be his last shot at big-budget movie-making.",Fantastic Four
618,mcclellandl,Very Disappointing! Not even worth going to see it at the cinema!,1,12 August 2015,"I think its one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. The entire movie felt like a rushed and confusing story. The effects and stuff were alright, but would expect more from a $120 million budget. The actors were alright but i think that the movie is what makes everything look bad. The ending is even worse. It quickly ends after the defeat of the bad guy. There was not much of a storyline when you compare it to the other Fantastic Four movies. There was more action and more of a story which you could understand. Overall the entire movie is shocking and is a waste of time going to see, even if you a huge Fantastic Four fan. I'm telling you now, you will be very disgusted. Marvel haven't spent enough time focusing on a storyline and more of a connection. The only real thing i believe they have focused on is the fight scenes, the destruction and the special effects that are within the movie. A whole lot more could of been done with $120 million. Don't bother going to the cinema to come out fed up and disappointed. Don't say i didn't warn you.",Fantastic Four
619,americaowe,Pure Garbage,1,6 September 2015,"This movie had nothing to do with the real Fantastic Four. I got the impression that the director hated the comic book characters and simply wanted to destroy their reputation. You have to wonder how with licensing and legalities nowadays, a director would be allowed to make a mockery of the whole comic book series? The movie drags and seems to be a rip off of other comic book movie scenes all mish mashed together. One of the worst mistakes in the casting was to make Sue Reeds biological brother black and then cover it up in the movie by claiming Sue is adopted. Making Doctor Doom an angry internet blogger borders on insane. And having the Thing have no pants was kind of creepy.",Fantastic Four

621,mrstagerlicious,Down But Definitely Not Out,7,6 August 2015,"It's been 8 years since the 3rd attempt at making a Fantastic Four film, which left such a bad taste in the mouth of movie goers. Josh Trank and this new, young cast bring us back to the universe of the team. Was it too soon? That doesn't seem to be the case. Almost everything about this film tells us that they tried to separate themselves from the previous films, and I think they succeed when it comes to that. Let's take a look at differences.New Director- Josh Trank brings us a new, grittier feel of the team we know and love. If you go into the theater expecting a fun, superhero blockbuster, then this movie will disappoint you. Trank gives us a different perspective of the team, starting them barely out of high school. From there, we take a journey into the race for successful inter-dimensional travel, and the emotional conflicts that go with it. For better or for worse, that is the main concept of the movie. Trank takes us through the lives of each and how they must intertwine to face each obstacle that lies ahead of them. Unfortunately, as soon as things start going downhill for our characters, the pace of the movie takes the same route.New Cast- The new Fantastic Four: Miles Teller (Mr. Fantastic), Kate Mara (Invisible Woman), Michael B. Jordan (The Human Torch), and Jamie Bell (The Thing). - Miles Teller is a strong lead. As ridiculous as the script got at a few points, this kid can act his way around it, and make me buy the scene. They put a new take on the character as the boy genius, who still has a lot to learn. We see this knowledge appropriately define who he is as the movie progresses. - Kate Mara is a refreshing site to see after Jessica Alba's version of the character. this universe, she is a young scientist-to-be, that is smart. We actually see and hear her intellect. And thank you to the writers for having none of those stupid ""invisible woman naked in the streets"" moments. - Michael B. Jordan. This is the guy to watch in the movie industry. Every time he hit the screen, all eyes were on him. He took a poorly written scene, that coincidentally puts him with the rest of our team-to-be (earlier in the movie), and makes me believe it. - Moving on to the The Thing himself, Jamie Bell. As Ben Grimm, he has a close relationship with Reed. Their differences are astronomical, and yet it works. He was clearly not the focus of the movie, but had one of the most clear character arks. The one thing i didn't like was kind of like the Hulk in Avengers. The Hulk had trouble controlling his powers, but then conveniently could when it was needed. The problem I had here was less physical and more emotional. He spent a year hating Reed, and then all was forgiven without much effort. The script just didn't work in his favor for that part of it, but his performance was still good. - Toby Kebbell as Doctor Doom. As Victor, he was a good addition to the cast. Now real quick. When it comes to movie portrayals of characters, I am a strong believer that the writers of the movies can do what they want. It is their story. Their portrayal. If you are looking for the character from the comics, this is far from it. In the movie, he is terrifying, powerful, and mad. And though it may sound the same, its not. Just see it for your self. And when i say terrifying, I am saying to not bring your 5 year olds to this movie. They may have nightmares. It's a quick scene, but still. Doom is different, but I enjoyed it.New Story- Keeping this part nice and short to avoid spoilers, it was interesting to say the least. As I said earlier, this is not your everyday comic book movie. This is more of a sci-fi thriller, that seemingly has hints of horror and action. The story starts out well, showing us who these characters are, and how they come to be who we know and love. The issue here, is that they built up some suspense and drama as we try to figure out what is going to become of our heroes, and I feel like it cops out from there. They would give us some tense scenes, and they would be too short. Then more poor dialogue would drag on for too long. It was kind of a tease to say the least. That same pattern would take us to the end of the film.Conclusion: Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, and their team really stood apart from the Tim Story Fantastic Four films. It was a different genre. Better cast. And there was no Mr. Fantastic dance sequence. The movie had pacing issues, and the script had quite a few weak points.Great start. Shaky middle. Decent ending. 6.5/10",Fantastic Four
622,miaalex-41817,Could have done better.,1,7 August 2015,"I expected so much out of this movie, since I grew up loving the first Fantastic 4. First of all, the movie was way too fast paced. Boom, they get their powers, and a year later they go and fight Victor, and then it's over. They tried to push Susan and Reed together with barely any development. Johnny Storm.. was that even him? Barely cocky, arrogant, humorous. And at the end they tried pushing the love/hate relationship between Johnny and Ben. I expected the movie to end right when they defeated Victor. That's how abrupt and short this movie was. There were too many gaps, not enough development, unlike the first Fantastic 4. John Trank, you could have done better. Plus, Ben was barely showing any signs of insecurity. He basically said, ""What happened to me? I don't like it, can you change me? OK thanks."" I didn't feel sad for him like I should have.",Fantastic Four
623,dilbertaragones,Its interesting but boring,4,3 September 2015,"Before I Decided to watch this in the big screen i've read a lot of bad reviews about how bored this movie, at first I want my whole family to enjoy this film, but because of bad reviews i just go on my own, But I think I Am one of the few people would say there's something good in this movie , i really like the story, the acting was good, the last action scene was astonish me,and i could say the story was unique, But the phasing of the story is very slow, the action scene was very limited , and doctor doom is very undeveloped character as a the main villain, yes!!! this movie sucks on many aspects, even this is an origin story its not reason to be a boring movie, I could say that the over cheesy old fantastic four with Chris Evans is much more enjoyable compare to this, But actually I would like to see a sequel , I want to know what they will do to their new equipment, what happened to the other dimension place, or doctor doom is still alive, and I want to see more Fantastic 4 in action.. If there will be a sequence i think i will just rent it or just watch it on HBO..",Fantastic Four
624,neonmaxxl-75025,"Well, nothing we didn't see before",2,21 September 2015,"First i have to admit, that F4 was never really ""my world"", anyway i watched ""F4"" and the sequel ""Silver Surfer"" and found them simply great. So, since i'm a big Marvel-Fan i hat to watch this one too, just for curiosity. I asked myself, ""why would Marvel redo it, what's the point in this""? If you watch a movie, and then watch a remake with a similar storyline, it's hard NOT to compare them. In the end i have to say ""they shouldn't have redone it. The characters are quite ""flat"", the characters motivations for doing what they do and for becoming what they become, are quite thin. The animations and CGI are good work, but that alone can't keep a movie ""alive"". Compared to the prequels' great humour, stories and characters, this one was (at least for me) not worth watching.",Fantastic Four
625,Wade_J,"Wow! I'm already missing the last two ""Fantastic 4""s",3,4 February 2016,"Going into the latest attempt at Fantastic Four, it was impossible for me not to be aware of all the production troubles: altercations between the director and cast, unnecessary studio involvement, last minute re-shoots, etc... However, many films in the past have succeeded despite troubled production, Jaws, Star Wars, to name 2 of the top of my head, so I was able to watch this with an open mind. Unfortunately, what I ended up with is what most feared: a Fantastic Four film doing the absolute minimum to be considered a film (so that Fox can retain the rights to the characters) and very little else. The Good: The first half of this movie came across as ""pretty bad"", which is a compliment relative to what I could say about the second half. It sets the film up for what could have been very interesting takes on these characters. For comic book readers, the setup is more close to the ""Ultimate Fantastic Four"" series than anything else. It has a somewhat ""sci-fi"" setting with some ""Cronenberg-ian"" elements mixed in. The Bad: Well, on a superficial level, the special effects look surprisingly dated, especially when held to the standard of other superhero films of today. The characters never feel like characters, they just feel like actors taking turns saying expository dialogue to move the plot forward until the end. Motivations just seem to pop out of thin air, and Dr. Doom is somehow done much worse than in previous entries. It's very unfortunate we can't get a decent Dr. Doom, he's not that hard of character to ""get right"". If Marvel can pull off ""Rocket Raccoon"", Dr. Doom should be a walk in the park. My biggest disappointment is that in the end, the film is just bad. Not a ""so bad its fun"" kind of bad, but just plain bad. Who I recommend it for: Just about no one, even the most hardcore of comic book fans. If you're really curious as to how poor this project turned out, and have been asking yourself ""how bad is it?"" then knock yourself out :)",Fantastic Four
626,LandoSolo,85% - 90% Character Backstory,3,2 June 2016,"I'll make this brief. This movie reboots the franchise from the 2005 film and it's sequel. Those films had problems which made it easy to comprehend why they didn't have much box office success. So along comes this reboot. And you would expect they learned from the mistakes from the previous films and made changes and improvements. Changes? Yes. Improvements?...What this movie does well is reinvent the characters while still holding true to the ""dogma"" and legacy of the FF. The special effects are also improved from the previous installments. The story provides strong character backstory to all of the principal characters. They're better developed compared to the previous FF movies. You get a good sense of who these characters are on the inside, and what motivates them and what they're challenges are. It's also worth mentioning that they did good job at conveying the relationship dynamics between all the group.However, backstory makes up the vast bulk of the movie's story! And it exhausted most of the movie. The classic protagonist/antagonist confrontation feels rushed, like a footnote to the entire movie. It almost seems like this movie is supposed to be a prequel to future installments that would be action packed blockbusters. So we could sit back and watch nonstop action and already be emotionally invested in the characters without spending any time on that. So unless you're totally entertained by the backstory, you're left feeling totally shortchanged. I'm adding a point in my rating because of the quality of the backstory, but I still have to rate it low; and label it a disappointment!",Fantastic Four
627,luap-51485,Pleasantly surprised but I understand the hate,7,19 August 2016,"I wont lie, the only reason I watched this film was because I heard it was awful and wanted to see how bad it was. However, I actually enjoyed watching it. Granted I had, had a wee tipple of sherry (yes I drink sherry) at the time but it still doesn't deserve all the hateIll try to keep this spoiler free as much as I can but SPOILER ALERT!The biggest problem was the ending which seemed to just wizz by at the end of the film which could have easily been solved by, I dunno? Making the film longer guys? It was frustratingly close to good yet choked right near the end. There wasn't tonnes of action scenes which I can see would frustrate a lot of you. But I still didn't get bored. Im not the type of person who gets excited at meaningless fight scenes. Unfortunately the final battle is pretty much that, and only lasts about 5mins. There were one or two moments when I thought ""that scene happened quick!"" Yet I never didn't know what was happening. And throughout the film I felt invested in our main characters and found myself in their shoes, feeling what they were going through. Simply put they should of just made the film longer, that would have solved most problems with this movie.Perhaps my view is slanted slightly. Iv made the effort to endure genuinely bad movies like Birdemic and Plan 9 from outer space, Movies so bad they help you appreciate anything after watching them. This certainly isn't like them.Iv heard a few complain that it wasn't completely true to the comics, but the truth is that studios aren't going to put the massive amounts of money that they do into making these films for comic book lovers which are a small population of people. They have to consider the general audience to make a profit so that argument ain't doing it for me.I should also explain that Im not particularly a fan of superhero movies, AKA Im not a mindless fan boy giving this film a pass because FANTASTIC 4 BABY YEAH! I have absolutely no bias towards this filmTo conclude I wanted to hate this movie. No I really did want to hate this movie! Me and my brother were genuinely going to ceremonially burn the disk in our garden and put the video on Instagram after watching it! My mental issues aside, I have to be fair when judging this movie, and from where I am, it doesn't deserve all the hate and gets a solid pass.",Fantastic Four
628,Scuzzos,This exists.,1,7 August 2015,"I'll start this off with the good news: This abortion of celluloid almost guarantees that the rights to the Fantastic Four will go the way of Ghost Rider, Spidey, The Punisher, Daredevil, and Elektra and come back home to Marvel where they belong. Fox clearly either A) doesn't care about these characters, B) doesn't get these characters, or more likely C) Both. I say Fox and not director Josh Trank because I actually stand by him in his tweet simply because I can't fathom a human being being responsible for something as soulless as this waste of two hours. A film this void of emotion, of stakes, of logic, of ANYTHING can only be the demented work of a committee of suits. Right, RIGHT??I would even throw in another star if it fell into the ""So-bad-it's-good"" Tommy Wiseau realm where I could at least have a good laugh and be the jackass heckling it. But it isn't even that bad. It commits a far greater sin, the greatest sin of all: It's nothing. I felt nothing. No nerd-rage about the desecration of beloved characters. No anger at the complete lack of logic. I just sat there and watched a sequence of events that I'm told were a ""story."" It wasn't funny, it wasn't exciting, it wasn't scary, it wasn't sad, it wasn't inspiring... it just... existed. Afterward, I got up and left, leaving a few brain cells behind to be swept up by the theater staff.Towards the end I found that I enjoyed the film better once I started rooting for Dr. Doom. He looked cooler than our ""heroes"" (who never seemed to be a team; just four people who happened to stand next to each other), he had his heart broken by Sue, and he was a man of great determination with a plan. So what if his plan makes absolutely no sense?As much fun as it is to shred this film for being an insult to the human race, in all fairness it was Dr. Doomed from the beginning. Fox made this for one reason and one reason only: If they didn't they were going to lose the rights to the property. Just like Sony made those half-hearted Spiderman remakes. When there isn't a soul on the set who isn't there for anything other than their paycheck, it shows. And that's what all the nit-picky complaints really boil down to: We want the people bringing us the story to love its characters and world as much as we do. And when we sense the apathy underneath all the CGI, we're out. If you don't love it, how will we?Everyone seemed to just be going through the motions, like a family tradition that no one wants to take part in anymore but we have to because grandma always liked it. Unfortunately this might make it tough for Marvel once they get it back - will anyone want to see a THIRD iteration of these dated characters? Is there even room in the MCU for them now that Ant-Man, Dr. Strange, Spidey, Black Panther, Daredevil, the Punisher, and Elektra are joining the scene? I certainly hope so. The suspense I'm in for the postmortem fallout is far greater than any suspense in this film.",Fantastic Four
629,ebonyinferno,They could have done so much with this movie,2,22 July 2017,"As someone who tries giving movies the benefit of the doubt, this movie was, hard to do that with.When I saw the reboot was changing up the Storms backstories, I was interested in seeing the film. I think the casting of Michael B was a good choice and a nice change from Chris Evans Johnny we saw in the first movies and thought his acting was the best of the cast. Unfortunately, the other cast seemed very emotionless in most of their scenes to me. And nobody had any chemistry together.The whole Ben and Reed story they were trying to do could have been great if the actors had more chemistry and it didn't feel so, again, emotionless.One thing I will say I appreciate they tried doing is showing the struggle they had after just transforming and being locked up; but even then they rushed those scenes along with the rest of the movie. The rushed fight against Victor made no sense because they did a terrible job building his relationship with the others unlike the previous installment. I was lost by the story half of the time and I don't think that went away by the end either. It was rushed and all over the place, it makes me sad because they could have done so much with this movie, maybe with a better script and some of the cast replaced it could have been better than first movies (that I personality enjoyed).",Fantastic Four

If you notice, the people that complained weren't familiar with comics, cartoons, other movies, etc. and that's the issue, well... one of many, I suppose.Anyway, watch the movie, and go in with an open mind. And my opinion probably shouldn't be taken seriously since I enjoyed 'Daredevil' with Ben Affleck.(I also hate to be THAT guy, but I swear, anytime someone of color replaces someone in a movie (wasn't the first time Johnny was black, though), it gets negative reviews... Maybe I'm just being THAT GUY, but I don't think it's a coincidence)",Fantastic Four

640,xarisp,Worst Marvel movie I've ever seen,4,8 August 2015,"Let's be honest. This movie was by far the largest disappointment this year. The only thing that links the Fantastic 4 with reality, is that it gets a 4 out of 10 score. With clemency.Fox really screwed up with a franchise that had all the credentials to be really good. Everybody knows the Fantastic 4 and everybody wanted to see a reboot because the previous movie also sucked. This decade is a time that super hero films have a very large fan group and every movie is anticipated with enthusiasm.The latest installment of Fantastic 4 did everything wrong. Starting with the duration, 100' is way too short for a reboot. They probably had a very low budget, considering the fact that many of the trailer scenes were deleted from the final outcome. The heroes are presented with the minimum background given, they tell us almost nothing about their personality and they are immediately put together as a team at a very expensive government project without anyone knowing anything about them. The Doom villain is one of the most powerful bad guys in the Marvel Universe and they defeat him in a 5 minute battle.That being said and with those thoughts in mind, I left the theater very disappointed and suggested others not to bother watching the movie because its probably one of the worst they would have ever seen.Do not watch this film if you are a hero fan!",Fantastic Four

This movie does not deliver a quality to the viewers in terms of story telling and acting. The graphic and CGI is OK but acting is the worst. Miles Teller does not deserve a lead role like this and this movie will be a living proof of this fact. Michael B. Jordan is not better than Miles Teller either.No character building is there and we do not feel attached to any of the characters at all. Sometimes it feels like the actors are trying too hard to act and its obvious they are over acting.On a short scale, the movie sucks and only watch if you have nothing else to do.",Fantastic Four
643,chogan9,Solid Foundation on Which to Build,8,10 August 2015,"1st - After the Credits Nothing After the credits in the way of next-movie-setup 2nd - The 1994 Film The rating for this film is only .1 higher than the pitiful attempt to make a bad public access pilot that is the 1994 Fantastic Four movie(3.9), so I would like to press upon everyone that reviews this title to remember just how bad a comic book movie can be. 3rd - The 2005 Film After re-watching the 2005 film (5.7), and comparing the rating of that launch to this reboot, I am informatively-puzzled by the front loading of reviews relative to release date. Take your comic book loving self back to 2005, expectations were high, we as a society were still blissfully unaware of the horror, the horror to come in X3(6.8) and Spider-man 3(6.2). Electra (4.8) was fresh off the flop pile, but female leads have always been a detriment in a male centric story world. Fantastic Four was received with mixed reviews. It was stuck somewhere between the matter of factness of the fist two X-Men films and the childish cartoon days of the 1990s, and 1970s, and I think the 1980s as well. All in all it is watchable for a comic fan or someone with an especially specific social or emotional tie to the film, but in comparison to the 2015 reboot, it is laughable as an artifact in an evolving genre. 4th - As to the 2015 Film This is an origin story. The story is a linear one, as appose to something like Man of Steel(7.2). The majority of the story takes place when all of the main characters are of an early college age, 18-25ish. This is an origin story. After the Four get their powers some time is spent using them to solve the greater and lesser problems of people on earth. Some of these problems are cause by Dr Doom. This is pretty much what we all learned from the trailers, and the general plot is similar to the 2005 and 1994 films, and every comic book with Dr Doom in it. Except for the one time where he may or may not have saved a kitten. The characters are well developed, gritty and true to their world and the events in it. I have recommended the film to everyone that I have met since seeing it. Even though I went into the film with firm reservations, I feel like this is the best Fantastic Four Movie that could be made outside of Marvel Studios. Post Script: The Silver Surfer movie is rated a 5.6 and they butchered, cooked and sold us all a piece of cloud Galactus for ten bucks a head.",Fantastic Four
644,MisterFantastical,"Not the worst movie I've ever seen...but not fun,",3,5 August 2015,"I'd like to preface this by saying that I've always been a fan of the Fantastic Four (as a comic, as a team, as a concept) for what they are and the entertaining nature of their team's dynamic. When I registered on IMDb over 12 years ago, my user name was in tribute to the team. And I walked out of the theater with a feeling that could best be described as ""empty"". It was worse than being disgusted or annoyed or appalled...this move was not the Fantastic Four in any sense.Now, my dislike of the film had nothing to do with the changing of The Human Torch's race (as so many of the Fox shills seem to immediately assume); I actually had no problem with that aspect of the change. But his entire CHARACTER was absolutely wrong. Johnny Storm was a fun, if childish guy with a playful streak and a good sense of humor. A ""sense of humor"" is pretty much what the comic book always employed; the team was a family, with its ups and downs, and had it dark moments, but they always landed on their feel and always had a cheerful undertone in the long run. The Fantastic Four in this film was not the Fantastic Four I was accustomed to IN ANY SENSE. This was FAR closer to being ""Chronicle 2"". Morose, dark, depressing, and totally devoid of the sense of fun and wonder that was this property's calling card. It almost more of a ""let's watch these unlikeable kids undergo painful body disfigurements"" feeling than anything.I certainly got the impression that Josh Trank has personal family issues...but I don't go to a superhero movie to watch a spoiled kid go through regression therapy. I'd be surprised if the planned sequel to this film happens, to be honest; there wasn't a likable character in the move (with the temporary exception of Reg E. Cathy's Franking Storm)...I've never walked out of a superhero movie with such a sense of disappointment. Although, as I said previously, I'm an admitted fan of the characters, so someone who wasn't AS aware of the correct back-story and nature of the property might not be AS disappointed.Please, for your own sake, avoid this film. It's not worth your time or money.",Fantastic Four
645,Thomas_Street,This movie left me very confused.,3,28 April 2016,"I know absolutely nothing about the Fantastic Four, and after seeing this movie, I still don't think I do. I only vaguely remember the previous Tim Story directed films, and that's about it. I gotta say, for a property that prides itself as being ""Marvel's First Family"", the Fantastic Four doesn't seem to be as well regarded as, say, anything else Marvel cranks out. Heck, shortly before the release of this movie, Marvel canceled their current run of Fantastic Four comics, and the sales of that last issue only solidifies that decision. So what's the deal? Why is Fantastic Four so ill-regarded in the eyes of Marvel and it's fans? Is it because of the movies? Maybe the comics are great, I don't know, but I certainly don't want to read them after not just one or two bad movies, but also a third one. And this version of the Fantastic Four is the most ill-received out of all of them, scoring a whooping 9% on Rotten Tomatoes compared to the low 20's and 30's percents the other two movies managed to get. (I'm purposely leaving the 1994 Roger Corman flick out of this because I haven't seen it, but if Fox really refuses to release it, then I think that says everything.) This version of the Fantastic Four is by far the darkest in terms of tone and mood, but it is also the most lifeless and bland. At a scant 99 minutes, I was also expecting a tighter pace, but that was only wishful thinking. The first half of this movie is very slow; they don't even get their powers until about halfway through. Honestly, I actually kinda liked the first half for what it's worth. All the setup and introductions to our characters was very well done. We got to see what everyone does and how they contribute to the group, it just goes on for way too long, and the dialogue is simply atrocious. The second half is where the movie completely derails. The pacing is manic and relentless, as if the movie itself obtained the power of super speed and is making up for lost time spent on too much buildup. The final confrontation with Doctor Doom is over and done before I even knew it was happening. I still have no idea how they actually defeated him, he just kinda disappears. No doubt it's in the second half where Fox demanded most of the re-shoots take place.Director Josh Trank blamed studio interference by Fox on the lackluster quality of the movie. Is that really true? Why did Fox demand re-shoots? I have a hard time believing the same studio that okays an R-rated Deadpool movie would have any problem with a decent Fantastic Four movie. But from what I've seen in the first half (albeit all it's problems), it looked like Trank had a good idea of what he wanted to do, but his behavior on set was reportedly awful. Was the pressure of a big studio project simply too much for him? Whatever the case with this movie was, I think it's safe to assume that we will never see another Fantastic Four movie in theaters for a very very long time.",Fantastic Four

Like this, and you think, no, this cannot be the end, the final battle as any final battle should last 30 minutes minimum with its up's and downs (i.e. first avengers, the new superman...), but here the final battle lasts... 10 minutes? For the rest of the movie, I've liked a lot, the only minus for this movie is that you fell a little cheated by the very weak final battle, you cannot build up, build up a MAJOR problem to be solved and then... snap your fingers, one solution and all fixed? It is like they were short on money and had to finish the movie any way.Even with this set-back, this movie does not deserve the rating the people are giving here (I would give a 7) so I am giving a 10 to try to help a little, as all F4 fans, I feel thankful they made a reboot of a so cool comic book.The action scenes with Reed Richards are so cool and any comic fan would love it (although they are few, its true).It would be nice to see a second part, but it looks like for the box office that it won't be true.

Trank keeps trying to rip off Akira and maybe the first time it worked but this time... He failed miserably. I was trying to see it like a sci-fi movie without the concept of the superhero archetype, but c'mon the movie isn't at least a good sci-fi movie. The thing with no ""thing"" is ridiculous, the effects look cheap for nowadays standards. Just don't waste your money and time giving this a chance, if something tells the ratings is that if a movie is any good it gets good reviews if it is awful it gets what it deserves from the critics, that's all; some people that live in constant negation think on conspiracy theories to explain low ratings.

649,WatchBMovies,Disappointments because of previous greatness,4,7 August 2015,"This movie got of with high ambitions to finally live up to the great stories within the comics. the ingredients were all there. - upcoming actors - great budget - good story referenceBut somehow this movie became in many perspectives Marvels greatest insult of this era. There has been some complains from the director itself that he didn't agree with this story and that his version of the comic adaptation was going to be different and therefore better. According to 20th Century Fox, the attitude of Josh Trank was not what they were expecting because he isolated himself to much and didn't gave good instructions to the crew. So they changed the script and storyline. But if you have seen the movie, you know that that wasn't the only thing wrong about it.Upcoming actors like Miles Teller (Divergent) and Kate Mara (House of Cards) already proved that they have proper acting skills. Although it seems like they forgot many basic rules when this movie was shot. Overacting or just not convincingly enough.But in my opinion, the previous marvel movies where the biggest reason for this abomination. because they were really good. And all of them lived up to the expectations. So the bar was pretty high on this one. And if it doesn't live up to the rest, it only makes it look more bad then it actually is. It has nice scenes in it. The build op to the point where they got there super powers was not that bad.But within the big picture, another disappointing fantastic 4",Fantastic Four

From the plot, to the slow pacing, to the ridiculously thin character development. It just sucked.Save yourself the time and never, ever, ever watch this movie.

Chemistry was off, I didn't feel like they were bonding at all, they seemed like four separate individuals, not a group. I didn't feel connection between Reed and Ben, or Reed and Sue. Character development was weak, not enough back story on the villain. It didn't have a lot of humour and some scenes were pretty awkward. The sad thing is that I really liked the cast.

652,jubaloyola,"Loses itself halfway, but still better than the critics would like you to think.",10,7 August 2015,"Don't get me wrong: this movie is not a masterpiece in anyway. In fact, I must start this review by saying that I do not actually believe this movie is deserving of a ten star rating -- If I were being fully honest, it'd be more deserving of a 6. I'm just giving it that because it most definitely deserves more than its current 4.2, and because I know its score would be a lot higher if the exact same film had been produced by Marvel studios.You see, the odds were always against this movie. The Fantastic Four is not an easy team to adapt to the screen; angry fan boys seem desperate to hate on Fox's every move; Michael B. Jordan's casting as Johnny Storm resulted in a disgusting wave of racist comments disguised as worry for the source material; Josh Trank was inexperienced and had never been involved in a movie this big. And all this negativity surrounding it, I believe, were the movie's biggest downfall. And I'm saying this because the bad parts of this movie generally weren't the cast, the tone or anything related to pre- production. The movie's idea and premise is great. For the most part (more on that later), the screenplay is good enough. The cast is excellent. What made this movie fail was how the studio seemingly gave up on it somewhere halfway through post-production.But let's start from the beginning -- the first half of this movie is great. Now, before you yell ""bullsh*t"" and scroll past this review, allow me to explain myself: this was never meant to be an action flick. It's a sci-fi thriller with coming of age elements. And as that, it works well. It doesn't have fight scenes and too much CGI because that is not the point. The movie is an origin story, presenting these characters as real people and establishing the universe they live in. The entire movie should have been like this, and its biggest mistake was to introduce unnecessary conflict in its second half. It would've worked just fine as a movie establishing the team, showing how they got their powers and how they got to be so close. The acting is great, with a special shout out to Jamie Bell (Ben Grimm) and Michael B. Jordan (Johnny Storm) who had less to work with but still managed to do a fine job with their characters. I was concerned about how they would manage to make Ben Grimm's emotions and suffering believable when he is in rock form, but that is a non-issue with the superb Bell. As for B. Jordan, he seems to really understand Johnny and adds some depth to what could have been a shallow character. As a fan of the Fantastic Four comic books, I also appreciated the many nods to the Ultimate storyline that the first half of the movie presents. A few scenes seem to have been taken directly from the first issues, and it's pleasant to see as a fan. Their dynamics are also good in the first moment, with Reed Richards and Ben Grimm's lifelong friendship being a particular highlight. Grimm is presented as Richards' protector, but instead of going down a much more obvious route with him fighting bullies away from Reed and standing up for him at any moment, they chose to present their relationship in a much more natural and subtle light, with Ben being almost like the proud parent Reed never had. It's sweet and well-written, never giving too much information away.The elements of body horror were, without a doubt, one of the strongest parts of the film. Had it focused more on that, it would've been better. The scene where we first see Ben Grimm's new physical form is absolutely heartbreaking, and Reed's powers' reveal is just as disturbing. Unfortunately, it is here where my compliments to this movie end.You can pinpoint the exact moment the movie begins its downward spiral towards chaos. The addition of conflict made it all seem very rushed and forced in comparison to the nice and evenly paced first half. From that point on, the CGI is suddenly terrible and the screenwriters seemingly forget how to make a proper screenplay. Dialogues are extremely cheesy and just downright terrible. You can see the re-shoots very clearly and it's extremely rushed. It all could – and should – have been about 10 or 20 minutes longer, and because they deal with the threat so quickly we don't even have the time to find Doom to be that threatening at all. As for the action sequence there's no way to sugarcoat this. It sucks. It shouldn't have been there in the first place. It doesn't fit the rest of the movie thematically and ruins what could have been an otherwise excellent villain for a sequel. All in all, it looks like the SFX team simply threw the towel and the editor stopped caring altogether and not even the young cast's talent manages to save the movie from its final act.Basically, what I'm saying is that this movie looks like two different movies that were forcibly turned into one. The first one is a good sci-fi character study and origin story that offers a fresh take on this otherwise unoriginal genre that has become comic book movies; the second one is, simply put, a train wreck with some of the worst SFX in recent memory and bad dialogue. It's sad to see the transition from one to another, and as the credits begin rolling, you can't help but imagine how the movie could have played out if they hadn't forced that second half in.",Fantastic Four

I would watch it if you have not seen it before, but i would not watch it again in the near future and the reasons for that are as follows (spoiler alert): 1. Poor CGI; the CGI in the first two movies from 2005 and 2007 was much smoother and better in terms of relevance and application. 2. Short battle scene at the end that poorly shows the powers of the 4. 3. Doctor doom looks like a robot painted with hydro-dipping. 4. The actor for Sue Storm does not look good with blonde hair. 5. Johnny Storm and his father is 'African American' and sue is 'Caucasian' (sure they can be adopted) but that is not how it is in the comic (f.y.i. all 3 are Caucasian). 6. The Thing (Ben) is more naturally rock looking compared to the older movie version, but the face is not right and lop sided. 7.

So they murdered the characters and origin stories etc..... Which would be almost OK or understandable if they had built the movie for a wider fan base than comic fans, but they didn't even do that. The movie contained less than 10 minutes of action (Thing throws 1 real punch in the entire movie). Dr. Doom's character was stripped from a grumpy, sorcery and technology infused dictator that's trying to ""Save"" the world in a not so nice fashion, to an angsty console gaming teen that's in the ""the gov'meant is evil"" phase. The movie is full of teen angst, exchanged between 30 year old actors playing 17 year old kids. Ben Grimm is a tough guy with a rigid (no) personality. By the time he says his catch phrase you don't even want to hear it, because you know there's going to be no heart behind it.Reed Richards is a smart guy with a rigid (no) personality. Except for the first time he tries to get Sue Storm to see how long he can stretch, he shows almost no heart in anything... Sue Storm is a smart lady with a rigid (no) personality. She has to have ear buds in at all times, because that's what kids are doing now days.Johnny Storm is the ""wild"" card with a tiny bit of personality, but as progressive as turning him black was, the decision quickly loses any and all merit on that front by making him utter blackenized ""DAYUMS!"" Victor Von Doom is another smart guy with a rigid (no) personality, other than that one time he tried to show Sue Storm how hard his steel shaft can get. Doom (Not Doctor Doom) Is a single minded tortured soul that's been twisted to think he should just destroy earth because someone threw a Butterfingers wrapper in the ditch one time, so if we are going to destroy the planet anyways, he'll just help us out. As opposed to his...every other counterpart, wanting to save the planet/humanity from external threat...but only under his rule does he foresee this.....This movie was created by 40-50 year olds that were trying their best to come up with the things ""Kids like these days"", and then just shoveled half formed thoughts into an under budgeted, undirected pile of Skrull sh*t.I give it 1 out of 5 stars, and unfortunately even that star is a crappy barely formed brown dwarf, that no one can or should see...

658,clacour2010,One of the worst big budget movies... ever,1,7 August 2015,"I love superhero movies and I don't mind reboots, so this movie should have been made specifically for ME. What I saw was a mind-boggling, 70 minute exposition followed by 5 minutes of controversy and 10 minutes of climax. Looking back over it, it reads like an hour long found footage mockumentary about superscientists that they decided to throw a villain into right at the end. If the idea was that everyone knows Doom, so why bother introducing him or making him menace anyone or anything throughout the whole movie... Then why take so freaking long to actually get to the fantastic four? The audience knew the whole time what direction they HAD to go in order to 'save the dimension' or whatever, but it was decided to take the longest possible (and most boring) way to get there. As for comedy relief, there was exactly one joke in the movie, ONE. And it was given out in the first trailer. Not that I require superheroes to engage in two-hour stand-up routines like three of them did in Age of Ultron, but SOMEthing that made the audience smile would have been nice. Since Doom wasn't in 90% of the movie, there was no antagonist, and therefore no conflict. As a result you have this makeshift, insane attempt to turn the audience again Reed, while trying to make them think he has some other kind of long term plan rather than just a year-long depression. Instead, they pick up a year later, everyone a little bit angrier, find Reed, fight for a minute, then go back to depression. I never much cared if comic book movies followed the comic canon faithfully. I've seen examples for either side of the argument that shows it only matters that you have a great story. What you had here was almost a bait-and-switch con. Getting people to buy tickets with a big budget, young actors, and trying to fly through on Marvel's decade of success. It's incredible to me that Antman and Guardians movies both knocked it out of the park, but I'd rather watch the LAST Fantastic Four movies than THIS Fantastic Four movie.I do need to say one thing about Doom. While the origin story might have been a good idea, his introduction was insane and completely without any kind of support that one of the top-tier villains deserves. And the way he wound up looking... So the story is that his hazmat suit fused with his skin after coming into contact with this radioactive energy substance. And what covers his mouth used to be the vent on his suit. But the effect winds up looking like a grey, shiny, Downs Syndrone looking head. And once you see the vent not as a vent, but as two enormous lips, you can't see it any other way. His head is FAR too large for his body and shoulders, and the overall look is more comical and pitiable than menacing or scary. In one of the final scenes, it is kind of disturbing to see a 6-foot, shiny, grey, down-syndrome patient with enormous lips that never move stalking through a compound and incinerating soldiers with eye contact. I'm sure it wasn't what they were going for when creating the Doom character, but for God's sake, I don't see how you can look at the film and see anything else!Only go see this movie if you have a curiosity about how they went about telling the story, as it is totally worthless as an entertainment experience.",Fantastic Four

660,catorrence1,"doesn't live up to expectations, but it's got some things going for it",5,7 August 2015,"Let's be honest; All the hype this movie had disappears completely. It suffers from the overused 'generic origin story' cliché, there's surprisingly little chemistry between the characters for a movie about one of Marvel's most tightly-knit families, and they kill off one of Marvel's most well loved villains (for the third flipping time!!!!). Not only that, Fox has said that this movie and its sequel would take place within their X-men universe, but there's no reference to mutants or anything that has happened in that universe. That being said, the movie does have a few things going for it. The cast selection is excellent, with Miles Teller doing a great job as the scientific genius, Mr. Fantastic. There are some good homages to the comics, such as Invisible Woman's force field bubble she uses and Mr. Fantastic's shape shifting abilities (although I would have preferred he shifted his hands into weapons instead of him changing his appearance), heck, you could argue that the Human Torch using the suit to activate his powers is homage to the original Human Torch from the comics. Also, if you compare it to 2005's dismal attempt, its better as far as tone and scientific accuracy (I'll take teleportation to another dimension over gamma induced space clouds any day). Despite what the critics say about this movie, I think it does deserve a sequel, at least so they can fix what they didn't do well in this movie. It's also a great chance to explore some of Marvel Comics' other Fantastic Four villains. The first thing they would have to do is change the name of that planet in the other dimension from 'planet zero' to 'The Negative Zone', which in the comics, serves as the location of the Marvel heroes' max security prison for villains as well as home to Annihilus, who controls what's called 'the Annihilation Wave'. This would also be a perfect opportunity to introduce the Alien nation of the Skrull to cinema, which Would basically serve the same purpose as Marvel's Kree alien nation; a nation of aliens to show that the characters we know are not the only ones in the universe. This would also help introduce one of Marvel's most creative villains in my opinion; The Super Skrull, a Skrull leader who has all the powers of the Fantastic Four (for more information on these classic Marvel creations, just use google/bing/marvel database). Bottom line, the movie is trying to popularize 'Marvel's First Family' during a time when Marvel movies are all the rage now. However its flaws and critical panning might prevent that. But if it does overcome that hump, then the franchise does have potential to become decent. Sony tried To make a franchise twice with Spider-Man before letting him join the MCU. Fox gets one more crack at the Fantastic Four, but if that doesn't work, Fox better work something out with Marvel before the fans make them.",Fantastic Four
661,stephenmontoya52,Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about,7,14 May 2021,"I think people are being way too hard on the movie. Maybe I'm ignorant on the marvel/ dc comics or comics in general. Personally I thought this movie was okay. It's one of those movies you have to just enjoy it for what it is in my opinion. Everyone's saying that it's too dark of a movie that doesn't keep up with the humor of the comics. Wasn't Batman the same way? Adam West being the goofy character rather than Christian bale/ Ben affleck being the more dark and vengeful Batman. I see the same trend in this movie, yet it's hated.I do think the actor choices were questionable, victor von doom just didn't come off as a victor von doom, I believe Ben was portrayed as too young of a character to pull it off. But overall I enjoyed it, people are babies.",Fantastic Four
662,DanielPinheiro,Just a beginning to something,6,11 August 2015,"I saw the movie today and the movie is not that bad. Is not a master piece but is not the worst thing in the world at all. The story has his major flaws but is a big movie just to introduce the character to work them afterwords. I think this evaluation of 3,9/10 is just a reaction and like always the internet reacts and never analyze. In a way since the Dark Night, superhero movies had the bar set a bit high and i kind set this movie like a Batman Begins of Fantastic 4. I hope to see more of this cast and this storyline with more action and fights to really make this franchise get a better opinion of the critics and the audience.",Fantastic Four
663,ryancolleran,Un-Fantastic to say the least!,3,6 August 2015,"I would strongly advise against going out to the cinema and paying to see this film. I was incredibly disappointed with it and regret paying cinema prices to see it.The film is incredibly unbalanced, with the most of it being dragged down by setting up the characters and plot, leaving very little time at the end for the real action to begin, and so it felt very rushed and was extremely unsatisfying.On top of this, the script was very poor and much of the dialogue was very cheesy and felt scripted, particularly during the action sequences, which made it seem very amateur. The films only redeeming factor is it's cast; Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan were particularly good and gave their characters depth and humanity. Kate Mara and Toby Kebbell were also good in their respective roles, however Jamie Bell was totally lost inside the CG 'Thing' which was a shame because he was so good in the beginning pre- transformation.I really would advise you skip heading out and paying cinema prices to see this film and stay home and pay much less to watch the far superior 2005 Fantastic Four.",Fantastic Four

They should have continued on from the first two movies using the same actors if possible, if not at least the same age group! Why the writers decided to reinvent the origins of the F4 is beyond me. And making the Storm siblings to be ethnic opposites, even implying Sue is adopted, was a sad and pathetic attempt by the writers to be politically correct. Why not stick to the comic book version??? The 2005 version and 2007 sequel are a far superior take on this popular comic book. This version was so bad I couldn't even watch the rest. Save your money!",Fantastic Four

But instead of making an entirely new movie about young scientists who break inter-dimensional travel, they chose to dump all over one of the best and well respected origin stories in comic book history. I assume it was so they could slap a familiar name on the title and reel in a few suckers that way.This was almost a great movie, but instead it became a really bad imitation of a FF movie.

Story has a lot of potential. Except reed character others acting is good. CGI TOWARDS climax is average But watchable. There are cool scenes. Some thrilling moments. The movie could have been 20 minutes longer. Some more action scenes and a 10 minutes additional scenes in climax could have been saved this movie. I hope they will rectify these errors in second part 2017. Overall surely one time watchable movie. I enjoyed it. I can proudly say that.

668,bostonwera,Believe it or not it is truly a Fantastic Movie!.,10,14 August 2015,"Fantastic Four (stylized as Fant4stic) is a 2015 superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. It is the third theatrical Fantastic Four film to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, and a reboot of the Fantastic Four film franchise.Friends Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) have worked together on a prototype teleporter since their childhood, eventually attracting the attention of Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), director of the Baxter Foundation, a government-sponsored research institute for young prodigies. Reed is recruited to join them and aid Storm's children, scientist Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and technician Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), into completing a ""Quantum Gate"" designed by Storm's wayward protégé, Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell), who begrudgingly agrees to help due to his unrequited feelings for Sue.The experiment is successful, and the facility's supervisor, Dr. Allen (Tim Blake Nelson), assembles a group of astronauts to venture into a parallel dimension known as ""Planet Zero"". Disappointed at being denied the chance to join the expedition, Reed, Johnny, and Victor recruit Ben to help them commandeer the Quantum Gate and embark on an unsanctioned voyage to Planet Zero, which they learn is a world filled with otherworldly substances. Victor attempts to collect a sample of the substances, causing the entire structure they are in to collapse and the ground to erupt with a green lava-like substance. Reed, Johnny, and Ben return to their shuttle just as Sue brings them back to Earth. Victor is left behind after he falls into the collapsing landscape. The machine explodes, altering Reed, Sue, Johnny, and Ben on a molecular-genetic level, affording them super-human conditions and abilities beyond their control: Reed can stretch like rubber, Sue can become invisible and generate force fields of energy, Johnny can engulf his entire body in flames and fly, and Ben becomes bigger and develops a rocklike hide which gives him enhanced strength and durability. They are then placed in government custody and confinement to be studied and have their conditions and abilities tested. Blaming himself for the accident, Reed escapes the facility and becomes a fugitive while desperately trying to find a cure.One year later, Reed is located in Central America by Sue and captured by Ben, who has become a military asset along with Johnny and Sue. Johnny and Sue have been outfitted with specialized suits, one of which Reed later receives, designed to keep up with their conditions and abilities and to help them stabilize, control, and contain their abilities. Reed is brought to Area 57, where Dr. Allen conscripts him to open another portal to Planet Zero in exchange for giving Reed the necessary resources to find a cure. Arriving in Planet Zero, Dr. Allen's explorers find Victor, who has been fused to his spacesuit and can now control the elements, as well as having telekinetic abilities, and bring him back to Earth. Driven insane by the experience and believing the human race needs to be destroyed so he can rebuild Planet Zero in his image, Victor escapes, killing scientists and soldiers in the base including Dr. Allen and Professor Storm. Victor returns to Planet Zero using the Quantum Gate, with Ben, Johnny, Reed, and Sue in pursuit.Now dubbing himself ""Doom"", he activates a portal on Planet Zero using a structure he made while in the realm, that begins consuming the landscape of the Earth. He is confronted by the four and, after a destructive battle, Ben punches Doom into the portal's energy beam, disintegrating him, while Johnny closes the portal. Returning to Earth, the group is rewarded for their heroics by being given a new base of operations by the United States military. They decide to use their powers to help people and adopt the mantle of the ""Fantastic Four"".Fantastic Four is really a great must see movie for all audience.",Fantastic Four
669,cookiemonstr333-20-490287,Completely Underrated,8,20 August 2015,"This film is very underrated. It was a really good film but the only problem with it was the running time. 100 minutes is too short for any marvel film. As a consequence of the short running time, I felt the ending was too rushed and the film was mainly just the characters' origin story. That does not mean it is a bad film because the origin stories are very interesting and it is very entertaining to see each character developing into their superhero or super-villain and how they do it. I am glad this film went into so much depth with the origin stories because it is rarely done in the Marvel cinematic Universe (with a few exceptions) All the problems with this film could be fixed with simply adding an extra 30 minutes (and a post-credit clip!). If you are considering watching this film just do it and remember just because it doesn't quite follow the beloved Marvel tradition it doesn't make it an appalling film and think of the ending as a bridge to future sequels and appearances in other Marvel films.",Fantastic Four
670,Kal-el8,I hate you fox,1,11 August 2015,This movie was good at some parts but overall I think it failed. I sadly hopped on the hype train when this movie was announced and I put way to much hope and trust into fox and sadly they took them and threw it in the bin then lit the bin on fire. There was a few glimpses of hope in the movie in such as the awakening scene when they all awoke and had saw the horrible disfigurement they went through. Overall it was good but t let me down in so many ways. All I want is to wait for Josh Tranks version of the movie to come out as that goes for an extra 45 minutes and has an additional 2 fight sequences.,Fantastic Four

I was really appalled at the mish-mash and disjointed storyline. First 30 minutes showed some promise only because there was a sense of character development....after that, the story takes a kindergarten, dyslexic and rushed jab at profiteering and duping the beloved name of Marvel. Film makers and promoters of @!@! like this should be held responsible under some Trading Standards regulations for mis-selling. Hype is one thing. Daylight robbery is what this is. I'd like my money back please. If only! Please do not watch! you'll feel like an idiot if you do. I still feel ashamed days later to have even considered watching it. Big big big thumbs down.

672,joekimber1998,Wow...,2,10 June 2016,"I wasn't excited to watch this flick due to the bad things I heard about it but HEY! I'm optimistic about these kind of things, so Fantastic Four came onto Now TV and I decided to give it a watch due to liking the old Fantastic Four franchise... I made a mistake. Great cast they are all rising stars no doubt but, this film couldn't save the cringe worthy lines and rubbish story. It started off good, then boring resulting in me watching YouTube videos whilst watching it, time flying by and it took about half the movie for them to get their actual powers. So I stop watching YouTube and trying to enjoy the rest but then it got boring again... AND FINALLY the villain Dr Doom comes back!! .... for about 5 minutes literally! He had great potential to be a good baddie but was wasted by having a short role in the movie AND HE WAS THE Villain! And to end it all a 4 minute fight scene that made me feel nothing at all. I literally thought it was half way through when it was ending, and surprised me that they would have actually thought it was acceptable for people to spend money on it! I'm relieved to hear they cancelled the 2nd one that was planned... GIVE IT A MISS FOLKS.",Fantastic Four
673,minimeyn,"Had potential, but a total dud",3,5 August 2015,"This movie had potential to be bigger than the rather 'bleak' 2005 version. I wasn't overly impressed with the younger cast but thought maybe they would take a different aspect on the film. I was also keen on how Dr. Doom would be portrayed and how he would influence the film as a villain. I couldn't be more wrong. -There was limited character back-story on the Fan 4 -There was no middle just a five minute climax at the end that was hardly gripping -The cringe-worthy quotes towards the end of the film were just punishing to watch -Dr. Doom looks like a Droid and goes completely insane over a minor issue and the movie doesn't quite explain why -Dr. Doom is also meant to be one of the most O.P characters in the comics but yet he seems to drop down to the levels of the Fan 4 in the final battle which previously you saw him destroy anything in his path previously. -Whats the go with Tim Nelson being in this movie seriously can they stop regurgitating actors from previously failed ' marvel ' movies and maybe have a fresh start for some characters, especially for someone with a mediocre role as he had -Not really a huge issue but very disappointingly no after credits scenes which are signature to marvel based moves ( even though it is owned by FOX ) The only reason I have given it a 3 is the visual effects, only for one character though. The Thing looked insane compared to the 2005 version, only problem was due to the short length of the movie he got limited time and whipped out some really punishing quotes towards the end of the movie. Also I did like Franklin Storm in this film, he was a breathe of fresh air...but again wasn't perfected pulling out some pretty cheesy lines.So overall it was a total dud, no background characterisation on the characters, if there was it was limited and to go along with the short running time, it was hard to watch. Dialogue was just really, really average and I spent a lot of time watching the movie with my hands on my head in agony.",Fantastic Four
674,dsuh03,I don't get it,6,20 August 2015,"After reading and watching so many viciously negative reviews online for Fantastic Four, I was intrigued to check it out just to see how bad it can really be. And you know what? I actually quite enjoyed this movie!Lowered expectations might have played into this but I think the movie has so many elements that make it interesting. Some critics have compared this to Batman and Robin and Superman IV but I honestly do not consider this movie in their league. I distinctively remember watching Batman and Robin in theater and people literally started walking out. I stayed for the whole show just because I paid for it. But this movie, I was actually drawn to it by its own merits. First of all, I am not a fantastic four comic book fan. But I am a fan of sci-fi movies and Josh Trank seems to have designed it to be a kind of sci-fi horror like The Fly. The first two acts played like those sci-fi horror films where in this case kids play with some untested invention and suffer horrific consequences. When you approach Fantastic Four from this angle, it becomes a movie about dealing with these horrific transformations. I like that Reed Richard's stretchy powers are not ridiculously silly like the earlier versions of F4 but rather they are gross to look at. And the same goes for the other members of F4. In this regard, Fantastic Four is a big budget version of Josh Trank's previous film, Chronicle. Chronicle succeeded because it took a realistic approach to the superhero origin story and how normal high school kids would deal with the newly gained power. When Fox hired Josh Trank for Fantastic Four, they must've known that he was going to take F4 on a similar path. The third act of the movie is where one can spot the studio interference. It feels truncated and rushed and does not tie up what was set up in the first two acts. It feels like Fox panicked at what they saw and tried to inject more mainstream superhero sequences. I'm curious where Josh Trank would've taken it were he not shortchanged. Anyway, this is not a great movie but it's not a horrible one either. If you are drawn to sci-fi films, this is quite enjoyable. I feel like if people watched this before the era of the internet, there would've been more positive reactions. Some of these angry negative reviews from online critics seem to just feed off each other.",Fantastic Four
675,graveyardshift1980,Old ideas in todays world get with the times,10,12 September 2015,"The biggest problem I keep running into with movie's ""inspired"" by comics are change. I get that people can be and are naturally resistant to change. Many of today's comics were created in a time where racism and difference meant something bad. Agree with that comment or not. Today's movies centered on old comic books ideas and uniting them with what we ""want"" today. I see nothing wrong with this. 90% of comments on this movie say something about the human torch being black. Well I say shame on you. I am proud to be fan of comics in a time where we are attempting to break boundaries with old ideas into a new age and if you can't grasp that.then again. Shame on you.",Fantastic Four
676,Skidawg53,Interesting take with no pay off,1,5 August 2015,"This movie definitely had a creative edge to it in the beginning, it looses steam quickly. They introduced the main four characters fairly well, but left far too much to be desired about it's villain. The pacing of the movie is all over the place, it felt like a full hour into the movie before we seen any character with power. The lines and writing in the movie was very groan inducing, I couldn't believe some of the cheesy quips the characters had. The build up for the end comes out of nowhere. While the final confrontation was easily the best part of the movie, it took way too long to see the characters use their powers, and it was rushed, the best part lasted what seemed like only 5 minutes. The movie itself feels like standing in line for a roller coaster that was only 20ft long. It's not worth your time, nor are you missing anything if you decide not to see it. Given a better writer and Director, it could've been great.",Fantastic Four
677,cassidykew,oh dear,2,10 September 2015,"I was very much looking forward to watching this film. I had enjoyed the previous Fantastic Four films and so had hoped for much better, bigger productions with new technology, effects etc. etc. I ignored all the negative press and bad reviews so that I could make my own mind up. It was bad! It wasn't even cheesy, it was past that. I would actually go as far as saying it was boring. I admit I watched the whole film, desperately looking for its saviour. Didn't find it. Well I most certainly wasted my time. It had so much potential, what went wrong? I've got a list. Casting maybe?

678,jakecartersoar,The worst film of 2015! (So Far!),2,7 August 2015,"Fant4stic (The first mistake fox made about this film) is the re- imagining of one of Marvels most beloved teams. This is the fourth time they have tried to do a Fantastic Four movie (If you include the one from the 90's) and each one has missed the mark completely! Before the trailers came, this film was getting a lot of hate and scepticism as there was no promotional footage or images before the trailer. But everyone had a bit more hope when the trailers came until Fox made an awful move of embargoing reviews 12 hours before the film was released. This was Fox basically telling us that they had no faith or trust in the movie...and they were right!Fant4stic was an absolute mess! Once again Fox has managed to mess up these characters again and put them in another horrible film! For the first 15 minutes or so, the film seemed to be going along smoothly and didn't find many flaws in it but after that the film got progressively worse! My first major criticism of the film is that this film is lifeless and dull. Never before have I seen a superhero film with so little charisma and charm to it! I know they were trying to go 'darker' but many other superhero films (The Dark Knight trilogy) have done it but still had an engaging, immersive plot and story. The reason this film is so lifeless is that nothing happens in it! It takes them 40 minutes into the film before they can get their powers and you would think the films pace would pick up by then...sadly it does not. The screenwriters had a really bad idea of skipping a whole year after they got their powers! So the next time we see them they've already gotten use to their powers! We could've spent at least a few minutes and scenes watching them get used to their powers and trying to control them!Even though the cast is very talented, they can't save the film unfortunately. The lines they say to each other feel forced and don't feel natural and the screenplay is sometimes very cringe worthy. The four also have no chemistry with each other which also makes the scenes with them together even more painful! You know a film is bad when even talent like Miles Teller, Micheal B Jordan, Jamie Bell and Kate Mara can't even give of their talent because the film is so sloppy.$100 million went into this film so the CGI must be good? Right? Once again no. Some of the effects were laughable and you can even tell where the green screen is in some shots. The worst CGI has to go to when Reed Richards transforms his face from a disguise back to himself. That scene looked atrocious and brought me straight out of the movie!Then there's the last act...which I can safely say may be one of my least favourite last acts ever. Out of nowhere Dr.Doom appears from the alternate dimension and gets brought back onto Earth where he is getting checked up on. He then kills everyone in the building and goes back into the alternate dimension with him taking the machine so no one can follow him. He then wants to destroy Earth with absolutely no motives other than ""I am the bad guy and there needs to be an obstacle for the Fantastic Four to overcome"" The Fantastic Four get to the other dimension and in 5 minutes they kill him. And then the film ends. There was no build up, no pay off, and an extremely anti-climatic ending. Once again they ruined one of Marvels greatest foes! He looks ridiculous for starters, he has no motives and is killed in minutes!The film has no development, no plot, no character arcs and especially no action as we never see them use there powers for most of the film! Where Fant4stic failed is where the MCU is not and I think that is a main reason for this not being a good film! What Fox are trying to do now is build a connected universe and build everything up for sequels and in doing that the film is all exposition and set up with no pay off at the end and instead of trying to build a cohesive and effective world where you can make sequels and lots of money, they should of tried to make a cohesive, effective, well done film.I do not recommend Fant4stic and give it a 2/10 and not a 1/10 only because the first 15 minutes were watchable.",Fantastic Four

I enjoyed the prior two movies that paved the way for the success of other marvel movies which includes the Avengers. You can't just put people in a role because you think that's what is politically correct to do now days and create false diversity. For the marvel comics, they are a part of history that those who love comics grew up with and identify with. I remember reading intensely these comics and collecting the full set of marvel 1 cards. It's something that you dream about and expands your imagination. But we have all been betrayed by this movie. The betrayal spans further because they are re-writing history to make a homo-iceman and a trans-thor. The new writers have betrayed the legacy of the beloved old writers because they come from the new liberal morally destructive programmed mentality and they plan to destroy history in the same way that they destroyed the US Constitution.

I have seen them all up to date of this one, and they all have their major failings. This take on Fantastic four is better than the others. That said, it didn't have to try hard in order to do that. The plot, for Fantastic Four (2015) is lacking in so many areas. It really feels like they used the chicken scratch left on a napkin during the concept stage. Character development takes way to long in this film. Out of 106 minutes to this film, 40 minutes are dedicated to character back story. Yes back story. It's not until almost 50 minutes into the film that they actually get their powers. You can start this movie up from about the 50 minute mark and never miss 1 piece of important information.The visuals for the movie looked great. Sadly even this is held off until after the first half of the movie. They actually did a decent job on the Thing this time around. Previous visions of the Thing outside the comic books were always lacking.Something else I found a bit strange. The movie held a really dark undertone. I guess it's a good thing the plot never fully developed that.The acting is solid. Is it award wining, no. 5 of 10. It's worth the watch at least once.",Fantastic Four
682,dumbidoom,Not fantastic at all.,2,6 August 2015,"This comes from the same studio that brought you Days of Future Past,and I really liked that movie.I'm a comic book fan,but this is absolute garbage.I will say right off the bat that the only good thing in the movie is Miles Teller as Reed Richards.All other casting choices are terrible.It's obvious that they made it just to keep the rights.If only Marvel got them,then we'd actually see a good Fantastic Four movie.Or,Fant4stic movie???It tries to be dark and gritty,not really to a point of Nolan's hyper- realism,though.The problem with this,however,is that it doesn't work for multiple reasons,but the main one is that Batman is an realistic hero.He is a man in a suit,nothing more.You cannot hyper-realize a man made of inter-dimensional rock.It doesn't work.This movie certainly takes it's place of bad comic book movies alongside Daredevil and Batman and Robin.At least those were goofy and fun.2/10 because Miles Teller is bae.",Fantastic Four
683,vasoczkiferenc,Oh my god,1,15 August 2017,"I knew, this was not the best film what I will see. No problem.When I saw the first 10 - 20 minutes I sad wow, I do not understand why this film is so down voted. I thought, this is much more better then the other, more realistic, and it could be better, the introduce of characters was so good, I've except a good film.SPOILERAfter that, they made the machine. So cool. And they just drunk, went into a non secured laboratory, go to another dimension (how the communication works, no explanation how, but forget it, somehow it was happened.)And these drunk kids just went into the most dangerous place of the other dimension, and put their hands into something unknowable. That was the point, when the start (I've bet it to 7.0 points) started to go down, deeper and deeper. I have no words guys, if you do not want to waste your time, skip this film.If you want to see really good junk movie, lets watch Death Race, that is a parody, but this...",Fantastic Four
684,Kroster14,Ouch. I need a Band-Aid. For my eyes. As this movie was bad.,1,15 August 2015,"Have you ever tried to remove your eyeballs and put them back into your eye sockets backwards so you can see the inside of your head? And then, after doing that, you ripped up ten dollars and burned the papery remains? Well, that would be a less painful and more productive use of your time than going to see this ""movie,"" and I use the term in the loosest possible way. The plot was vague, the action was nonexistent, and the graphics were that of Yoshi's Island for the Nintendo DS. On top of that, there was a lack of characterization and a bigger lack of any substance or consequences for actions. For example, after launching a fireball at his sister's face, the Human Torch looked at her and quietly said, ""My bad."" They then continued to ""fight crime"" as if nothing happened. Another example- Ben and Reed have a huge fight, which ends with Ben declaring he is no longer Reed's friend, but that he is something different altogether. After ten minutes, during which the rest of the movie happened and no conversation took place, they were suddenly, once again, the best of friends. Another massive issue with the film is its slow moving introduction, rushed climax, and nonexistent conclusion. After about an hour, the main characters have yet to receive their powers. It is around this time that the victim (viewer) realizes the movie is like a chocolate easter bunny. It's completely hollow, cheap, and makes you extremely sick. After this hour of pre-superpowers, the team gains their powers. After another thirty minutes of a ""woe is me"" attitude from the characters, the villain shows up. He then demonstrates his god-like powers, and it seems nothing can stop yet. He then travels to his home, where he suddenly sinks down to the level of four teenagers who barely understand how to use their powers. After this ten minute climax, which came after an hour and a half of buildup, the movie ends. The superhero team had yet to name themselves the...",Fantastic Four
685,Heraklion,Abysmal Writing and Bad CGI,2,7 August 2015,"Has anybody taught the filmmakers the importance of a tight script? The deadline could have been a thousand years in the future. The budget could have been the GDP of a small country! Saving a film with a bad script is like saving the Titanic with a baby's flotation device. The script was terribly amateurish. Clichéd, devoid of emotion, generic, uninteresting, and all over the place. The plot was as disorganized as a teenager's bedroom, with the villain appearing an hour later that it should have. The entire script of Fantastic Four yelled, ""Amateur!"". I could write a little book about all of the failures in Fantastic Four's writing. The visuals were dumb and lazy. Good Lord, if your script is going to be flatter than Salar de Uyuni, please have the bloody consideration to invest proper money and time into your CGI! Planet Zero looked like a test demo from an outdated video-game graphics engine. I would end this review with a pun about how not ""fantastic"" this reboot is, but that would be too generous of me. Don't watch this film.",Fantastic Four
686,sethdecker,If you're out for blood...,10,11 August 2015,"I had a free movie ticket to use last night, and while I was not going to use it on Pixels or Vacation, my other options were to see Ant- man again, or see Fantastic 4. I've been perusing the boards on IMDb and I've seen nothing but malice; but it was free. I went into the theater expecting to see something as bad as X-men 3 or Ghost Rider, or god forbid, something worse than the first 2 F4 movies. When I left the theater, I left angry. I wasn't angry at the movie, and I wasn't angry at Hollywood. I was angry at you. And I get it! Everyone has a chip on their shoulder because Hollywood is pumping out either EPIC blockbusters, nonsensical indie movies, or absolute pig swill. Pixels was a last straw; the beginning of the new era where everyone isn't just a critic, but a legitimate movie reviewer. Pixels was torn to shreds, and there is still blood in the water. F4 was sadly wading in the pool when it all went down, and has been blasted for no GOOD reason. I believe this film is the sad casualty of the mob mentality of the average Joe. You didn't understand what the movie was shooting for, and therefore couldn't see it for what it was.This movie is NOT: The Avengers. Or really any super hero film that has come out in the last two decades. The CGI effects are 90% amazing. There were a few shots of the Thing and Reed that were a little less than perfect, but I'll allow that blame to fall on executive rushing.This movie is NOT: A huge budget action flick. It's not self aware like Deadpool, it's not drummed up with anticipation like Avengers, it's not a Shakespearean trip to Asgard.This movie IS: A new idea for hero flicks. It finely walks the line between the realism of The Dark Knight, and the Sci-fi nature of the source material. I thought it walked the line very well. There are sci-fi horror-esque scenes that help you feel the real fear in the 4. There are balls out action scenes where the thing is tearing apart a small army (This scene shouldn't have been reduced to a TV viewing screen, probably a Trank scene that Fox cut for no good reason). The over all tone is Super 8 meets the X-men.Did you want a huge movie? Sorry there bub, this isn't for you. Did you want to be catered with easy to swallow cheesiness and shallow dialogue? Probably not your cup of tea either. If you wanted a movie that acts as a great launchpad for future explorations into space, our messed up military, REAL science fiction, and more than just a popcorn flick, this is for you. If you wanted a movie that didn't HAVE to be huge to be fun, didn't HAVE to be ultra real to be believable, and actually has the ability to save some of the hugeness to bank later, this is the one for you. The characters are REAL. The villain isn't over the top and laughable. Reed learns his place and has DIMENSION. You actually feel sorry for the Thing instead of wishing you could be made of rock. Human torch is ACTUALLY hot headed, not just wise cracking and sexy. Sue Storm plays a REAL introvert, not someone flower just waiting to bloom.Trank took an odd route and made a smaller movie, in hopes to get bigger and bigger with each sequel, and you pooped all over him for having the balls to go small. I really liked this movie for being what it set out to be; 4 scared kids gain powers they can't quite control, get exploited by our government and learn how to be a team in a real world with real consequences. This movie lands above the middle for Marvel movies. There have been A lot worse (Looking at you Iron Man 2-3) and there have been better (Winter Soldier was rad as hell). Hopefully the world comes to it's senses before we don't get another sequel, Galactus can be redeemed on the silver screen, and we can maybe in the next decade get an Onslaught movie.",Fantastic Four
687,mizzbiebs,"Good build up, terrible climax/end",7,7 August 2015,"I was looking forward to this movie for a long time. After reading many negative reviews, I kinda wanted to watch the film for myself and see.. Well, the reviewers were right.The movie starts off really well and goes well until after the one year jump part. The buildup between Reed and Ben was played out really well. The scenes in the beginning between Reed and Sue make you feel like they are going to have some sort of romantic relationship but the movie never actually does that. And I think Johnny Storm and his father were terrible actors, it was so hard to watch god.And the worst of all was.. Victor Von Doom. You basically have no idea why he decides to be the 'bad guy', like we don't know of any motives he has, it's as if he's just bad cuz he's..bad?Literally, the movie is great, really cool, until after the one year jump mark, it just goes downhill after that. Especially that quick fight scene in the ending...it was just awfully terrible. I would recommend seeing this movie just for the fun of it, don't go in with high expectations like I somewhat did..",Fantastic Four
688,maanitaman,This is beyond disappointing!,1,7 August 2015,"-- SPOILER WARNING -- Oh, boy... They've done it. 20th Century Fox: Why do you always ruin everything? I mean... WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?! IS THIS EVEN MARVEL?! NO! 4 movies, and NONE of them go right. This one has to be the second worst movie of them all; just before the 1994 movie. Nothing is right in this movie! The movie is far too short to be even called a Marvel film. The story is boring, the characters are bland and atrocious. What's worse? You bring in people like Michael Jordan here. Movies like this can effectively destroy one's career. I don't think any of the characters are done right, especially Victor Von Doom. Some random location in a different plane of existence? That is just thrown in there. Victor is suddenly consumed by some power? No. I'm a fan of Doctor Doom especially, so you can imagine my frustration at how he was handled. He's not supposed to be some sort of weird alien looking thing. He's supposed to be a man who uses his father's medial and scientific knowledge and his mother's magic to create various inventions and eventually become the Dr. Doom we know. Where is that?! Where are the Doombots, for God's sake?! There is so much wrong done to this character! Oh, he's suddenly smarter than Reed? Reed Richards is quite possibly THE smartest character the Marvel universe. Yes, Victor is smart, but he still pales in comparison to minds like Reed. As for the Fantastic Four? There was very little, if any at all, interaction as a team. The powers? Susan wasn't even there when the powers are around. Sudden conflict between the characters? Wow, Reed and Ben have been friends since childhood, but suddenly hate each other? Whoops. It's like seeing a bunch of kids trying to imitate their favorite heroes. Ugh. The entire movie is nothing but exposition. It leads to absolutely nothing. The CGI is absolutely pathetic. The story and actions are far too predictable. Also, it's a superhero film. Gee, I wonder how many fight scenes are in this movie? JUST ONE! AND IT BARELY TAKES UP A FRACTION OF THE MOVIE! It wasn't even that entertaining! Like, literally, when it all ended, I was like ""...That's it? THAT'S IT?!"". What kind of a superhero film is this?Absolutely nothing in this movie can be called correct. Just nothing. Personal pet peeve, why wasn't there an after credits scene? Isn't that customary for a Marvel film? Well, yeah, but it's not a Marvel film. It's a shameless attempt by 20th Century Fox to show that they still own the rights to Fantastic 4. The director, Josh Trank, was the man behind the movie Chronicle, which was very enjoyable to watch. He tweeted that his original plan for the movie would have been received better and that the producers ruined it. I honestly don't know if I should believe that, but I'll take his word for it. Long story short, don't watch this movie. It's not worth it.",Fantastic Four
689,jeromeantone,Not great. Not fantastic. Solid enough for me...,6,9 August 2015,"I just saw the movie this morning, with an open mind and I can honestly say it was not NEARLY as BAD as the initial reviews. Angry die hard fans of the comic want the Fantastic Four wearing baby blue suits with giant 4's on them. That was never going to happen when the studio hired someone like Josh Trank. His only directing credit is a dark and twisty science fiction movie like CHRONICLE. It was very grounded and solid at least to me. Not great. Not ""fantastic."" But a solid movie nonetheless. I do personally think it needed a little more comedic moments, bigger action sequences and more overall interaction between Sue and Reed. I give the movie a C+ or maybe even a B- ...but like I said that's just my opinion.",Fantastic Four

So today, I went with my two friends to see This movie, Fantastic four (2015). We all are big Marvel/Dc fans, we where looking forward to this, but we looked and read some reviews before we went, and there wasn't a single good one. I totally agree. I thought this film was a massive let down, there wasn't anything behind the characters. You got to learn some information behind them, in the originals, but in this one, you only learnt a small tiny bit about Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) and basically nothing about the rest of the characters, so if you haven't seen the originals, you're basically screwed, because you wont learn anything... I'm going to keep this short. I would of asked for a refund, but I didn't know what they would think. If id did ask, but I had a good day out with all my friends and that's all that matters. Last of all, if you go into cinemas expecting some good action, don't. The fight you wait for is a massive let down and literally lasts 50 seconds. very disappointed.. I hope this review helps.",Fantastic Four

I went in with very low opinions but was pleasantly surprised & more importantly my son loved it. Didn't think too much of the original films but was impressed with the character development & the darker (non camp) tone. Yes it was slow in places and the action was over too quick, but like the way they showed the characters from an early age and set the story up. Hopefully they will make a sequel now we know who people are etc so we get more action and a longer film. Will be adding it to the blu-Ray collection upon release.",Fantastic Four

For one, the movie doesn't cut short for the originality of the fantastic four movies, this movie should be untitled ""four"". Because this four characters aren't fantastic at all. I mean sure the actors were great but their characters weren't, they weren't even up to par with the original fantastic four characters. In fact they didn't remind me of a fantastic four character. they reminded me of comic con where people dress up as their favorite hero, but sadly the actors playing the hero didn't live up to the character itself.

694,cpolanco-57131,Don't let the negativity keep you away,8,22 October 2015,"so i just got finished watching the new fantastic four movie. i ashamedly admit that i let other peoples' opinions keep me from watching it because after all the rage this movie HAD to be crap right? man that movie was dope. everybody who didn't enjoy it, hated it for one reason: they couldn't take it for what it really is. a reboot. so no duh it's not gonna be exactly how it is in the comics or even those god awful f4 movies in the early 2000's (it's like how everybody complained about how bad the new Michael bay tmnt was even though you look back at the live action movies from the 90's and they were GARBAGE) nostalgia makes everybody think the next thing is not as good. I came in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised, some of the lines were corny as hell, and doom kinda looks like a cartoon character, but other than that this movie was legit. okay, i'm out of movie reviewer mode lol i just hate the fact it got such a bad rap over unrealistic nerd standards and now we might not get a sequel. all that said, just remember: reviews are only other peoples' OPINIONS",Fantastic Four
695,onick-papazian,Much Better than Expected 10/10,10,11 August 2015,"My honest rate would be 7.5/10 but I'm putting 10/10 to get the ridiculous ratings up for this movie. I thought the movie was great. I am a fan of the comics since the 80s during the John Byrne era. The movie captured the family theme perfectly and felt just like the comic. The only thing missing was some comical rivalry scenes between Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm. I like the setup very much. Ben Grim's tagline ""It's clobberin' time"" get's its own origin story. The racial inclusion of a black Johnny Storm was seamless. I would love to see the FF hang with the Inhumans on screen but the studios have no respect for American art. Also we would really need Quicksilver to be alive for the whole Quicksilver/Medusa arc.The bad reviews are undeserved. I suspect there was some sort of campaign to kill this movie's potential before it left the barn to push the studio to give up it's rights. Selling the rights would make up for the losses on this expensive film. We'll never know. I'm looking forward to FF2 regardless.

The story was wrong, the background was wrong and even one actors skin colour was wrong. If you want to make a movie about an established comic then do it right and follow it. Otherwise don't do it. He could have done another movie with 4 or more superheroes, where are the Arabic person, the Indian person, the Asian person etc? There are tons and tons of super heroes out there to pick from if you want to be political correct, but guess what, not all groups is political correct and it's nothing wrong with that. This movie is simply awful, bad, horrible and should be avoided at all cost. The rating (4.3 atm) is way to high, I rather see Birdemic again before this one.",Fantastic Four
697,halsa,Would make a decent school project,1,5 July 2016,"The first fifteen, or maybe even twenty minutes (Reed and Ben as kids, the science fair) had me interested and made me think this film was going somewhere. But boy, was I wrong.There were a lot of super long scenes that simply just made audiences lose interest, for example 'building the machine', or the aftermath of the journey through the 'other dimension'. Personally, I feel these scenes were extended just to make the movie longer.I will admit I enjoyed the bit with Dr. Doom walking through the hall, it was super bad-boy and very well done. That scene is definitely one to watch again - if you have not seen the film due to poor reviews, I highly recommend you watch that bit.The dialogue in 'Fantastic Four' could be compared by one made in middle school. I was literally covering my face in my hands in a few scenes. It was impossible to like/hate the characters when everything they say feels fake. This is evident in the scene when they explore the 'other dimension'. When Victor Doom falls in the green liquid, I did not flinch a muscle. I did not say 'Oh no! Not Victor!' like the filmmakers expected me to. And it was all due to the (very) poor dialogue. But nothing beats the ending:'That's fantastic.' 'Say that again.' 'That's fantastic.'

Most important was in this movie that i'll again say this system can transport us which will also reduce time, there're such kind of cities where traffic jam is everyday's phenomenon. In future it might be a great idie to transport people. Behind all of this all the four characters of this movie was also great but scene-tic views was pretty bad.

Kate Mara, you are gorgeous and a wonderful actress and I admire your work and, most importantly, I hope this willfully awful thing has not destroyed your career.So: Script = No. Direction = No. Characters = No (which is odd, because the Fantastic Four are great characters, and yet you have managed to get a 'no' with them. Remarkable!). Miles Teller = No. Josh Trank = No. Even for cereal commercials, no.Recast the original Fantastic 4 movie and reboot THAT. What you have done is bad. I'm stunned.

I was waiting (for a long while) to see when they would get their powers and there were some mismatch from what I know about Fantastic Four in earlier movies. I remembered Reed being older and it didn't click to me immediately that Johnny is going to be different and Sue is not American? I thought the dialogue was a bit too simple. But past all that, I couldn't stop watching the movie (and stopped my workout instead). The simple scenes like Johnny and Reed's failed fist bump or Reed ignoring Victor's accusations of love in the office, show Reed's character. How the characters were feeling when the transformation took place were quite real. It wasn't something they would immediately embrace but need to go through some training. It was a fun and realistic movie. Though i didn't get to watch in the end, I definitely think it deserves more stars and would watch the sequel.",Fantastic Four

705,aaronangus,If you like the comics or good story telling don't watch this movie,1,5 August 2015,"One thing I loved about the comic is the relationship they have with each other. Especially the back and forth between the Thing and Human Torch but there is no team interaction in this film whatsoever. On top of that Sue Storm isn't even with the group when they get their powers! In a time when technology is getting better and it's getting harder to tell when something is computer generated or not how does a blockbuster such as this get away with bad CG. Fant4stic could have addressed all of the previous complaints and would have still emerged as a pretty bad movie; above everything else, the biggest problem with the film is its story. Not just that it's poorly conceived and not fleshed out at all, but that it's told in such a lazy, haphazard way. There's the usual protracted pre-transformation set-up that's been mandatory since Batman Begins, which runs for the first half of the movie and falls flat thanks to the poorly written characters. Then bright lights happen, powers are given, heroes are captured and we jump forward a year inexplicably. OK, so things are going to look at how they've changed in that time, right? Nope. All of a sudden the third act motivation – heralded by the return of Doom – appears out of nowhere and we're into a rushed final sequence where the heroes' first attempt to stop the destruction of Earth actually works. THE END. That's it. That is the most measured way to present Fant4stic's narrative. I'd say it was written for an audience with a severely short attention span, constantly mixing up the status quo just to make things appear vaguely interesting, but the short run time suggests key development points were actually edited out, leading to such incredibly choppy pacing. Again – an explanation, not an excuse. Fant4stic is barely a movie. It's a bunch of vaguely connected moments cobbled together to 100 minutes so it can qualify for a cinematic release; the idea there's a coherent narrative with a flowing story between its vaguely defined beginning and end is so contentious it's insulting.",Fantastic Four

707,mclaubacher,That was just upsetting.,2,17 September 2019,"Well, this movie happened. Honestly I was hoping that I'd enjoy it, just because everyone hates it so much. But this is just...wow. It barely has a structure, the cinematography is so lackluster and boring, the effects range from pretty good to downright terrible, the cast is sadly misused, and the villain literally doesn't show up until there are 20 minutes left in the movie.The characters are flat and boring, to the point that Reed's offhand comment to Susan about music being ""her thing"" was actually accurate. everyone has one character trait that they're stuck to for the runtime. Reed's the nerd who doesn't have friends; Ben's the tough, angry one; Johnny's the cool badass who breaks the rules; Susan likes music and patterns; and Victor is just edgy Reed until he's evil out of nowhere 3/4 of the way through the movie because the filmmakers remembered that they needed to check the villain box for their superhero flick.While I'd recommend movies like Daredevil, Batman & Robin, and Catwoman for the ironic enjoyment, I wouldn't force my worst enemies to watch this movie. It's so dull, to the point that half the action and all the ""character development"" is talked about rather than ever shown.The dialog makes me cringe so hard. No one interacts naturally, to the point that a major character death has no real emotional weight. The whole movie is just one long series of characters saying stuff that sounds dumb.The casting was actually kind of exciting to me. I thought they all would actually do a good job with what they were given, but it's clear the on-set issues led to the actors not giving a damn. Mara and Teller aren't even close to having a tiny bit of chemistry, and Jordan and Bell are clearly phoning in their performances. Kebbell also obviously doesn't care, but he's not in a lot of the movie.The effects are passable by 2015 standards for the most part. The render on The Thing is actually pretty solid. That part was actually good. Doom doesn't look absolutely terrible (I mean his design is crap, but his effects aren't too bad). Mr. Fantastic is occasionally uncanny, but his power is stretching so that's not unexpected. The Human Torch effects are easily the worst in the movie. They look just as bad as the effects on Chris Evans from 2005.Overall, I give the movie 2/5 stars because at least the effects aren't terrible. This is also not the worst movie I've ever seen, even if it's in the running for worst superhero movie.Fingers crossed Marvel Studios will make the first really good Fantastic 4 movie.",Fantastic Four

There was a disconnect through the cast but it was understandable as most of them had a troubling past in the movie and this was the first time they were forced to work together. A lot of the comments for this movie are negative but they are comparing the story to old school fantastic four when the movie, from the beginning, clearly highlights that this movie takes place in a very modern place. Many of the negative criticism is about the movie not being funny enough i liked the new direction they took, it was freaky at times to watch the F4 being exploited. The movie wasn't catered to the critics or angry fanboy who were already furious that the movie was going to be based on the UF4 and that they were changing Johnny ethnicity.

The cast is fantastic (no pun intended), the movie is exceptionally made and the story line, although it deviates slightly from the comics, keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The character development in this film is next level - we couldn't help but sympathize with the new heroes as they ""worked"" for the government with the hope of finding a cure for their mutations. I mean, can you believe the government did that to them!? Now let's talk about Dr. Doom - man, he's pure evil! What a great villain. At first we thought there was no way the Fantastic Four would be able to stop him, but were literally cheering out loud when the new superheroes banded together to defeat that monster from destroying Earth. What a thrill. Such a great ending... Afterwards I went on to IMDB to check out the film details and couldnt believe the reviews for this movie! I honestly don't get it. This is hands down one of the best movies me and my parents have ever seen, and FYI - we watch a lot of movies. In other words, don't believe every review you read! Thanks Marvel for this remake, it was such a treat.",Fantastic Four

714,alinick-96986,Blatant racism and bad storyline,1,1 March 2021,"I know I probably should have realized that Kate Mara (Sue Storm) and Michael B Jordan (Johnny Storm) were going to play siblings for this film, but I didn't really think about the implications until I started watching the movie. The fact that the producers of this film decided they wanted a hunky black actor like Michael B Jordan but then decided that they didn't want a black lead actress really left me feeling disgusted. Why wouldn't you make the whole family black if the father and son were both black actors? Also when they threw in that one second ""I'm adopted"" line to explain it all away and without any other backstory for why Sue would be adopted really highlighted the fact that the producers just wanted a white actress in the lead role.I should have stopped watching there but decided to keep going because I was interested in this new storyline about how the Fantastic Four became who they are and how they got their powers. However, this new backstory just didn't add up. It was dumb that Sue got powers even though she didn't go to the other dimension and in the end Doom comes back with a vengeance to destroy the world for no reason and then after a five minute fight scene all is good and the movie is over.",Fantastic Four
715,TheCapedCowboy,"I actually like this, though I understand why many don't.",7,3 November 2021,"For fans of the comic team Fantastic Four, it's easy to see how this disappoints. Dr. Doom is nothing like the comic version, and the origin story of the team is changed so much as to be basically completely re-written.I am often the guy among my friends who likes everything, except that on the rare occasion when I do NOT like something it is usually something that most people DO. Examples: Blade Runner puts me to sleep. Joker I HATED for creating absolutely no empathy at all for the character, merely contempt. I kept wanting Batman to time travel back and squash him like the useless bumbling contemptible emo bug he was, and by the time his childhood abuse was revealed it was FAR too late to feel sorry for him; the die had been cast. And even if I had felt sorry for him it would have been the kind of sympathy one has for a mad dog. It is sad it has happened, but it still must be put down. Star Trek - I'm a huge life long fan and have liked every series EXCEPT Lower Decks, which it seems all other fans like and I find completely un-watchable. There are a few more but this review isn't about those. (I even like the Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern. I don't LOVE it, but I like it - but I'm a huge GL fan.)The older 2005 FF is admittedly a lot better, at least if you can overlook The Thing just being the actor in a rubber suit which I can, but I think the FF origin story needs a bit of an update and I like how that was done in this one, in general at least. It has a Lovecraftian spin to it that I really enjoyed. I relate to Reed as a young boy as I was something like that with my ham radio and electronics hobby among other scientific and technical interests, though my radio and electronics hobby was the one that had my room looking like a much lower budget version of young Reed's. ;) My family was nothing like the train wreck young Richards had to endure but otherwise that was very relatable to me.I thought it really sort of finished showing a lot of promise for a second movie, but of course the horrible reviews and reception killed that. I understand why it wasn't a big hit, but I don't really understand why it's considered so awful. Bottom line - don't assume that because nearly everyone else hated it you will. You might like it; a few of us do.",Fantastic Four

719,TheSpecs,Two reasons this movie failed,2,16 August 2015,"The movie started off well but declined so terribly midway and ended abruptly. I have two major negative points: *SPOILERS AHEAD* 1. There was only one big fight scene. Usually when heroes first attain their super abilities there is a 'practice' fight scene when the hero(es) exercise their powers and discovers strengths, weaknesses, limits, etc. and also struggle to function properly as a team. After the battle the team should bond and/or come to terms with their powers better. Then there should be a second fight scene when the heroes exhibit new confidence and strength as a whole. None of this happened in the movie. In fact there was very little bonding and character development fullstop. Yes there was a bit of struggle but any strife between characters was forgotten entirely by the end without much resolution. 2. Susan Storm's wig. Her hair seemed to change colour every scene and varied throughout the film from blond dyed hair to a wig. I have a huge problem with this not only because I found her wig(s) distracting but the fact that it was necessary for her character to have blond hair at all made me angry. The male characters in the film don't seem dependent on any physical features - black hair, red hair, tall, short, black, white - none of it seems to matter. But it is inconceivable to recreate a Susan Storm sans blond hair. It seems to me that producers think the audience simply won't be able to recognise her unless they paint her exactly as she was originally created... like as if female characters are never to be listened to or understood. They're just there to be looked at.",Fantastic Four
720,ynqrrxtyj,This movie is god awful,2,31 October 2021,"I mean, what the hell? Nothing happens throughout the entire duration of this movie. They get their powers, time fast forward, they have a tiny little battle and then the movie ends! Nothing happens, the CGI is the worst I've seen when I watched this back in 2015, doctor doom looks like a trash bag, the group have no chemistry! What is this movie?!?! Genuinely asking, this feels like a fever dream. This is up there with Batman and robin with being one of the worst superhero movies ever.",Fantastic Four
721,protc38,Worst superhero movie of the decade so far,1,7 August 2015,"Even though this movie has been getting heat since before it came out, I was still planning to watch it for myself and form my own opinion. This morning before going to the theater, I saw the director Josh Trank was already blaming the studio for the crappy reviews the movie got. This is happening the very first day the movie is out. Even so, I decided to watch it anyways. The only thing similar to the comics is the name, and that there are 4 individuals that have powers. Reeds and Sue have no chemistry, and there's no sign of romance at all. Johnny and Ben only talk to each other the last minute of the movie, and it's the human torch who ""cracks"" a joke at the thing, that sounds mean spirited and not funny at all. Reed leaves his friends for a year, and becomes fugitive, and when they find him all is forgotten (by the military and the research founders) in less than a minute. Doom is presented to be almost omnipotent, and is taken down by four kids that have no fighting experience (except the thing) in 3 minutes. This movie makes no sense, the plot is flat and unoriginal, the cast is too young, and it feels more like the story of Reed Richards than that of the team. Sue's hair is something that should not distract me, but it did. You can tell which scenes were a re-shoot just by looking at her wig. Johnny is portrayed as a bad boy with daddy issues, not funny and almost mean spirited. Ben Grimm is the smallest of the four, even Sue. Reed is an introvert that can't lead his own life, let alone a team.I really wanted to like this movie, since I've read lots of comics in my time, and I always welcome a movie adaptation of the genre, but this movie tries really hard to be disliked, and it's the only thing that it's good at.",Fantastic Four
722,dingerbell,Promising Start is a means to an insulting end to Marvel hits,3,7 August 2015,"After the last FF4, you would hope they could at least improve on this, especially with a good cast and Matthew Vaughan on board (after saving X-men), hopes were high. For the opening hour or so, all was looking good, the story was developing, a little bit of a wobble after they gained their powers, but the story picked up again and looked like it had a strong foundation to continue with.......then it crashed into a crescendo of diabolical storyline, acting and action, that was an insult to the viewers and cinema as a whole. It started so well, but felt like they for the last twenty minutes, they decided to test the theory that if you put infinite monkeys in a cage with typewriters, they would recreate Shakespeare......Instead they employed 20 monkeys, who proceeded to soil themselves, throw it at each other, but produced a plot ending, that would have embarrassed a straight to VHS 1980 B-movie",Fantastic Four
723,Dash_Rendar23,Fantastic Four (2015): The Ultimate Failure,1,11 August 2015,"My Review of Fantastic Four (2015) Spoilers I finished Fantastic Four (2015) online on Saturday and I don't know where to start with this movie or even know what the hell did I just watch when I saw. I'm just going to be frank on this with anyone that is reading this review. This movie is completely boring and terrible at the highest level possible. Its more boring then Ang Lee's Hulk movie back in 2003 and even that movie had a bit more action and better acting in then this movie does that FOX has released to the public. The whole time that you watch this movie it will keep wondering when will the action start and it doesn't start until 1 hours and 20 mins into the movie where a fight scene happens. It is the only one major fight scene in this poor excuse of a movie where it involves the Fantastic Four and Doom fighting each other which is just awful. The fight does not add anything in this movie at all. Though-out the whole movie nothing amazing happens. Most of the time characters just working around talking to each other and doing nothing interesting at all. The people acting in this movie just come across as if they're drugged and just bored with being in the movie. It makes Kristen Steward's acting in the Twilight movies look more life-like which is funny because she barely shows any form acting or emotion in any of her movies but that is a different story.The SFX are nothing special or awe inspiring like other successful comic book movies out there so don't go thinking that your mind will be blown away because it won't. The story is nothing special which makes it even more boring and dull to watch. The actors neither act or even look like the characters from the Fantastic Four. They have zero chemistry and don't even act like a family like they're suppose in the comic books. Dr. Doom is neither menacing or come across as a real threat as he is suppose to like in the comic books. Plus, he looks nothing Dr. Doom, he just look likes a green glowing crash dummy instead of Dr. Doom from the comic books. Worse, this movie also tries so hard to be like Nolan's Batman movie only for it to just fall flat on its face trying to do so. It tries to put in the dark, gloomy and realistic elements of Nolan's Batman movies but at the process of taking away the fun elements from the Fantastic Four comic books. What is worse is that the actors involved in the movie were told to not even read the comic books to become familiar with the role. Why is that? In the modern era of comic book movie, almost every movie actor has been told to read the comic books to understand the characters. Why did Fox and the director did the opposite and tell their cast to not read the comic books? It makes no sense at all.This whole movie was just a Fantastic Four In Name Only Movie. Nothing more and nothing less. I agree with the majority of fans, critics and movie-goers out there. FOX studios only made this movie to keep the Fantastic Four movie rights from Marvel Studios and now is blowing up in their faces big time! The movie on Rotten Tomates has a lower rating then Batman and Robin (1997) and that is suppose to be the worse comic book movie ever to be made. Funny thing is as terrible as Batman and Robin was I found it to be a more entertaining then this movie. At least I could laugh at how stupid Batman and Robin was but this movie just wants to put me to sleep. I had to push myself to finish watching this movie. This new Fantastic Four movie is in a league of its own when it comes to be a terrible comic book movie or just a movie in general. It will not be long before it becomes the worst comic book movie of all time. I honestly hope that the movie rights goes back to Marvel Studios because FOX cannot be trust with the franchise. They multiple chances to get it right and they have failed each time because they purposely wanted to ruin the franchise. FOX and Josh Trank (Director of Fantastic Four 2015) have only themselves to blame for this movie that is flopping badly for all the right reasons. In conclusion, don't waste your money on this movie. Either see it for free or wait for it to be released at the 99 cent store. Don't torture yourself trying to spend money on it unless you want to cure yourself from insomnia but that is another story. This movie is just dull, boring and just totally lifeless movie. It offers nothing to the Fantastic Four franchise and it doesn't do it any justice at all. It is the ultimate failure as a comic book movie and it won't be long before people consider this movie as easily one of the many worse movies ever made.1 out of 5 stars",Fantastic Four
724,alexandr332,Why was this movie released?,3,10 August 2015,"While the last batch of the Fantastic Four was lack luster, this one was just plain awful.Plot - Rehash of every other F4 film. The Fantastic Four get powers (this time through a dimensional portal) and fight Doom. Doom is actually missing for most of the movie, and the climax isn't satisfying. In fact, Doom seems to be all-powerful at the beginning of the climax in HIS dimension... then The Thing punches him and he seems to lose any ability to defend himself. Really?I can't even figure out how all of these characters even got together. All of them are supposedly intelligent (except maybe Grimm) but nothing they do on screen makes any of them appear to be a genius. Sorry, it seems like all they did was engineer it and there's no real explanation to how they do it. Fine, that makes you smart... but they don't USE it in any intelligent way, just travel through it.Characters - The ONLY character that had any development and you might care about is Father Storm. 1. Reed - Supposedly intelligent but all of the intelligence is off-screen, simply working on the teleporter. Nothing that he does in interacting with the other characters or reacting to events convinces me that he's a genius. 2. Sue Storm - The fact that she's adopted doesn't really mean much or help the plot in anyway except to allow them to have a white female with a black father/son. 3. Johnny Storm - Not as much the smart ass/daredevil as previous incarnations. The first time we meet him, he's redlining and then crashing his car. Without some other basis to believe he's actually GOOD at racing, not a good start. Then throughout the movie, he doesn't do much in terms of action. 4. Grimm/Thing - Appears at the beginning to help Reed, but there's absolutely NO development of what he does, other than bring spare parts for Reed to use on his teleporter v1.0. And his brother uses the 'Clobberin time' line for almost no reason. He's also missing for about half of the movie, and the 'tension' they try to create between Reed and Grimm/Thing is just not believable. He headbutts Reed once (after Reed had just avoided a punch)... and then all seems to be forgiven. Really? This might be more due to the 1.5 hr runtime, maybe they planned to make the tension more interesting in an earlier release. We'll probably never know.After all of the good superhero movies we've had recently, this just makes no sense. Who green-lighted this garbage? They need to be fired. Thankfully it was only 1.5 hrs of my life I'll never get back and not the 2.5 hrs I wasted on Tomorrowland.",Fantastic Four

I don't think the world would except another reboot even if Marvel Studios was doing it. I would love to see what Netflix could do with this with a 10 hour season.As it becomes clear this movie is going to be one gigantic flop, lets hope the actors of this movie know it's not their fault and that it was doomed from the beginning.

727,Joshua-890-321717,Not-so Fantastic 4,5,6 August 2015,"I wasn't expecting much from this film but due to being a big comic book fan and being a student in the film industry, I felt I had to see it myself and make my own opinion on it. I have never been a big fan of the Fantastic 4 but I have always loved Dr Doom. I personally feel that Dr Doom was too dark a character to be associated with Fantastic 4. This film was very dark compared to the previous instalments and I don't think it was the right approach to make. I feel that Dr Doom is such a dark character in the comics that the team and he don't really benefit each other in the cinematic world.Visual effects were average. Many people have complained about the appearance of The Thing but I personally quite like his new appearance even though it is completely CGI. However, Reed Richard's flexible and extendable arms look terrible. I thought that area would have improved after the same effects from the previous films were terrible as well. I questioned the cast when I first discovered they were in it. I think Miles Teller is a brilliant actor but I don't think he was right for the role at all. I thought Kate Mara was a good choice and I would have probably cast her in that role if I made it myself. Michael Jordan was not right for Johnny Storm and as much as I like Jamie Bell, I kept thinking of Billy Elliott every time The Thing was on screen. Toby Kebbell was brilliant as Viktor Von Doom. He got his personality right in my eyes and was entertaining to watch. But as Dr Doom I felt he was just too boring. He didn't have the same attitude as he does as Viktor. Overall, I think the story would have been brilliant had it been made to be publicised as a comic. However, film wise, it wasn't so. I did not like the fact Reed abandoned the team. In my views, Reed would never leave his friends for his own benefit. The famous 'Final Fight' in marvel is usually a big and memorable thing in superhero films. I felt the fight was too quick and not so memorable at all and it was too easy for the team to defeat Dr Doom.And then they copy the Age of Ultron ending quote. Just as Reed says ""FANTASTIC-"". I personally find this horrible to watch. I didn't like it at all in the Avengers and it was not good in this film.Overall I wouldn't say don't watch it, however you shouldn't expect much from it. If you want an honest and fair opinion of it just simply watch it yourself.",Fantastic Four
728,iamtalknu,Marvel-less,2,25 October 2015,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a fan of both Marvel movies and comic books. When I first heard that there was going to be a reboot of The Fantastic 4 franchise I was happy to see how they could develop these Characters. Then I started reading the critical reviews and started to wonder what had gone wrong. There are lots of movies that get slated in top reviews and I love them, but was this going to be one of those movies? I'm afraid not.There is so much material they could have used to create an amazing movie, but they did so little with the writing and that's odd when you look at the fact that they credit a group of people as the writers? all they created was a movie that will need to be rebooted again by someone who can actually write a story. I'm sure the script for this movie would have gotten a failing grade from any English teacher worth their salt.I'll make this easy for people who are not sure. The movie takes 90 minutes to get to the credits. They must have been drooling about all the sequels they would be able to do in the future and forgot to actually write a plot, character development or even something as simple as cheeky banter? So, if you can watch it for free on TV you might be willing to waste that 90 minutes, but you'll hate yourself for doing it.don't say I didn't warn you.",Fantastic Four
729,aleksandar-popovic,Awful,2,12 August 2015,"This is my first review here. I had to write this because this is literally first time in my life that I wanted to leave out from cinema. I don't understand how Marvel allowed this movie to go out, after all those good movies lately. Story is bad, acting is like in teenage series, plot, is there plot in this movie at all? Why teenage actors? Half of movie is some kids rubbish, nothing is happening for hour and a half, nothing. And when something finally happens, you wish it didn't. Last two F4 movies are way better than this one, and I hope this will not have a sequel. You never feel anything except boredom while watching this. Not even effects are anything special. I hope director and producer will stop making movies after this one, they can go on Sy-Fy channel and make stuff like this, not for cinema.",Fantastic Four
730,leandro263,"Come on, Fox. That's getting awkward.",3,9 August 2015,"One of the most famous questions about Marvel Comics is answered in this movie: Is The Thing's ""thing"" made of rock? The answer is pretty anticlimactic, though. It's very fitting, also, regarding what has been done to the characters, both heroes and villain. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those expecting, even hoping, that this movie would suck. I had high hopes that it would work this time. Honestly, it goes decently until the third act. It seems like they made some last minute changes to appease the fans but it was too late. Doom isn't a blogger, nor is called Domashev. But that barely matters, since that character is less Doom than even the previous two movies. Pre- villain Victor Von Doom himself is a pretty nice guy, you can end up even sympathizing with him, but when Dr. Doom is revealed, is almost as if a switch is flipped where the director crumbles under the pressure and decides to rush things out of pettiness, delivering such a half-assed third act that ruins a movie that was OK until then, even with all the flaws. Right to the hot topic: Making Johnny and Sue stepbrothers DID ruined their relationship. It was so badly handed, that the two are barely registered as co-workers. It seems as if they decided that a black guy being overprotective over a white girl would sound too creepy. Another trait that was dumped from comics was Ben and Johnny constant bickering. Half the movie passes until Ben gets to interact with his future team members, and when we finally see Johnny annoying Ben, the movie is ending and feels forced, like something added at the last minute. Several scenes hint to something that'll be important or that'll happen afterwards, but they never pay off. It seems like they left a lot at the cutting room floor, specially because a lot of finished scenes from the trailers never even show up. I believe this time Fox finished ruining FF's chances at being a franchise the public will care about.",Fantastic Four

Change came and went, and left me, a guy who grew up on Fantastic Four comics, trying to suppress the nausea! Why do these nitwit Hollywood screenwriters always try to change what's been successful for half a century? And why do they ALWAYS make Dr. Doom one of the original exploration team members, ultimately giving him super powers?? It certainly wasn't a selling point for the first set of movies! Doom has no superhuman physical abilities!! He's all tech and magic! Johnny and Sue are blood, one of them is not an adopted refugee from Kosovo! African American comic fans deserve an African American hero like Luke Cage, or an African hero like the Black Panther! Characters who are actually of African descent! Stop giving them black versions of white characters! They deserve better!! Do a Hancock sequel for crying out loud! THAT movie was great! I wish that trying to please a demographic was the only thing wrong with this film! Unfortunately, it was only the last six inches of a very large iceberg!

After a 40 minutes of torture, finally something, but the problems come to float, the story behind the characters is pointless, dull and the antagonist is not what you expect. There are no chemistry between the actor, all of the have their great performance in TV and cinema, but the is no direction or writing that helps to reinforcement their relationship. In conclusion don't waste your money !!!!",Fantastic Four
738,rlder35,Better than advertised,6,7 August 2015,"I'll begin by saying that i heard nothing but Terrible things about this prior to seeing it. I was pleasantly surprised though. While by no means a classic, Fantastic Four is an above average film that is mildly entertaining. It doesn't compare favorably to the recent work of Marvel, but it still does the job it needs to. It's a nice origin story that will pave the way for a sequel. Unfortunately, comic book snobs are dragging the rating down. I'm sure that's part of the reason that a brand new xD theater was only 20-25% full on opening day, but I enjoyed it and look forward to a (hopefully?) sequel. There are no standout performances, and it's a bit campy at times, but it's worth the money if you go into it with an open mind.",Fantastic Four
739,noirkhali,"Very Flawed, very original dark superhero film.",9,6 August 2015,"It's a really good action adventure film, the score it's magnificent and the acting it's superb for most of the cast (I'll admit, that not everyone is on the same league), even if they're all playing some sort of over-saturated stereotype they still manage to maintain a certainty of their motivations. The movie admittedly tries to be extremely edgy and dark for moments, but you can see that for whatever unpleasant story wise moment, there's and equally engaging one within the characters. The music is perfect, and you'll notice that great care was made into making us not noticing it at all, the directing seems firm, and it really looks as if everyone really (or most of them anyway) had faith in the Trank's vision which I really dig because of its original, if not difficult approach. If you want to stay in your safe, entertaining zone, fast pace popcorn movie place, stay away from this movie, but if somehow you may be in longing for a very good movie, with a reasonable payoff and great character construction, this is your hero flick to be looking forward. My high 9 score is based in its originality, and quality values, not in its overall superhero movie formula pattern. Which it's actually safe to say, it fails miserably.",Fantastic Four
740,wpasquariello,Extremely drawn out plot set up all leading up to a boring and poorly executed 10 minute climax. Bad casting decisions and what the f**k was Doctor Doom wearing?,1,11 September 2015,"Fantastic Four was probably the most insulting film adaptation of a comic book series I've ever watched. Why would Marvel let this movie out into theaters? It's an abomination.The film's plot and dialogue were so bland and the pacing of the movie was just off. Not too much of anything happens in the first three quarters of the story, and then the rest of the film feels extremely rushed... probably because it was. The Fantastic Four don't actually use their powers until the last 30 minutes. The whole film just builds up to the 10 minute fight scene between Doctor Doom and The Fantastic Four. And even that was hugely unsatisfying.Don't forget that the whole film is being supported by probably the worst cast in a marvel film to date. Whoever selected this cast should in fact quit their day job. Reed Richards is not the strong inspiring leader he is supposed to be... and he was just about the only character with any development. Also who was in charge of the costume design? Specifically Doom's costume design?... because that was pretty awful too. It looks like he's got grey, burned flesh all over his body with a potato sack for a hood and cape.The only good thing I can say is that it looked nice. The special effects were just about the only thing that was on par with this film. But that doesn't make up for anything. This movie was a disaster and a disgrace.

742,keefer-313-370084,A Disappointing Film,4,9 September 2015,"KIDS FIRST! ""Fantastic Four"" Reviewed by Keefer C.BlakesleeA disappointing film that had a riveting first half but a rushed and forced seconded half. 4 young minds create a machine that transports them into a alternate universe. Once they come back they have acquired unique powers that they need to control.The first half looks promising. The pacing, character development, and story are engaging. The darker direction they're going with the story makes it enjoyable. My favorite scene is when the 4 discover their abilities. There's a sense of fear, tragedy, and betrayal with the characters. It started out as another successful origin story, then it felt like the editors pressed the fast-foreword button once it stared getting interesting. The second half felt like a long sneak peek for the next Fantastic 4 film. It had a great head start but it left me wanting more in a negative way. There was enough 4, but lacked fantastic. The updated special effects are one of the redeeming qualities of this film. The presentation of each power is stunning. The impressive design of Ben Grimm/The Thing (Jamie Bell) and fluent stretching effects of Mister Fantastic gives this film an updated edge. At first there is a connection among the characters; both with each other and the audience. The actors pull this off seamlessly and you are sincerely captivated with their goals and struggles. However, they suffer during the second half as all their hard work is painfully rushed. My favorite character is Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic (Miles Teller). Richards is one of the people who help build the machine. He ends up getting the ability of an elastic body,, which means he can stretch any part of his anatomy. Miles Teller has been on a roll with his career and for good reasons. He's a talented actor who dives deeply into the characters he plays. This part is no exception.The moral of the film, though a bit forced, is like Abraham Lincoln's saying, ""A house dived against itself cannot stand"". The 4 heroes face Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and attack him individually. Soon they realize, that together, they are stronger.I give this 4 out of 10 stars and recommend this to 10 through 18 years of age. There's some dark material and language that younger audiences may not be able to handle. This film has some saving aspects but it sadly does not recover the whole film. In theaters August 7thKeefer C.Blakeslee, Age 15, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",Fantastic Four

The plot was very week did not really see one for the most part. Not a lot of action in the movie tell the last half hr if that even. There where sections of the film where i was confused to why they even put those parts in the film, there was no point. felt like the director was trying to find things to put in the film, probably because he had no say in the plot. the film also had an atmosphere of self loathing i could not get past. i only gave it a 4 because i have this sense of loyalty to all my superheroes even the ones in this movie. 4/10",Fantastic Four
745,d-man_96,Better than a cathodization,1,14 August 2015,"Now where to begin with such an awful movie.... Now lets say your bad in bed, if you were able to do foreplay as long as the build-up and ""character building"" to this movie you would be undoubtedly the best sex beast in the world. But if your cunnilingus lasted as long as the movies ""climax"" then you would have lost all credibility. Now if you were to say the movie is okay at best you would also have to say the holocaust was alright, no exaggeration at all. As you have noticed above character building and climax were in inverted commas. I say that with great emphasis because honestly it just didn't exist. First ill start with the shiniest of two turds, the climax of the movie. The climax was the worst thing since the black plague swept through Europe. There was a lot of build-up for absolutely no point and the fighting was shorter than the verdict for guilty for a minority at a court trial. Honestly i'm not for prostitution but i could get screwed better for my money by a heroin addicted truckie named Jim for the same price of this movie ticket. Now we're onto the character building. Now it might have had some credibility if the movie actually had good acting and a good plot line. I've seen better plot lines at a overbooked cemetery for ugly people. The character building just was about as existent as Denis Ferguson life as a free man. It just wasn't going to happen and at about half way through the movie i thought i might go and get electron therapy to erase this disgrace of a comic-book movie from my mind.If Stan Lee even is ashamed to make his usual cameo in the movie then you should get the message that you shouldn't watch it. I still love comic-book based movies and i have high hopes for the rest to come, at least this has set the base so low that even watching two girls one cup seems like a better idea for a night. So high hopes for more marvel movies to come!!!",Fantastic Four
746,livhunt,Just not Marvel,4,10 August 2015,"The movie was decent so I can't give it a zero, but the fact that this is a ""Marvel"" superhero with no ties to the Avengers or any movies of that matter, just make it a sloppy remake. Should have followed the comic book lines. Ben was supposed to be a football star and pilot and while the others followed suite to their disciplines, it just felt like something was missing. It seemed more dark like the DC movies. I did bring my 2 younger sons with and I am regretting that due to the use of the cursing that happens in the movie. It is definitely a PG-13 movie and I would hold it to that. No Stan Lee??? What the heck....No after credit scene to keep us guessing?",Fantastic Four
747,tonywilmz68-438-368040,As a movie.....,6,20 August 2015,"I never really had any desire to watch this remake of The Fantastic Four. I actually thought it was just gonna be an attempt to cater for the youth of today. Just like I thought the Spiderman reboot was. But people were saying that this movie was soooo bad I just had to watch it.But just like anything with such low expectations it never tends to be as bad as you anticipate. Which is what happened with me.Instead of being the juvenile movie that I thought it was gonna be, I found it out quite ""grown up"" in the way it was shot and in the way the movie dealt with the origins of all the characters. In fact...I could've easily handled the fact the whole movie was just an origin story and brought in the action that all these comicbook fans demand into the sequel, instead of just throwing in the tiny action sequence at the end like they did. But why was it so tiny? The movie's only 90 odd minutes long. They could've made it so much more.Anyways...I'm guessing my opinion's gonna be as unpopular as the movie itself. One person on IMDb has said it's ""An insult to comic fans"". But what about movie fans? If you just forget about the comic for one second....is the movie as a ""movie"" worth only 3.9 on IMDb.All the negativity surrounding this movie really helped.",Fantastic Four

The harsh critics aren't wrong, this is a boring movie. It has the most stereotypical plot you could possibly imagine (if you were to plot a line it'd look like a gentle slope up for the first 75% and drop off for the remaining 25%) and the peak represents a single very bland confrontation. I'll give it to them that the producers didn't spend a ton of time explaining how the characters get their powers, but that said they didn't spend any time explaining anything about any of their characters.

The thing was that the trailer actually made the movie look not too bad but in fact it was all a trick to make its money back. Miles Teller was never really the right choice and poorly acted as the super smart Reed Richards. The villain was also extremely unconvincing and while the actor wasn't terrible, the character just didn't really fit into the movie very well. Lets just hope that Fox decide to sell these characters back to Marvel since they are the only ones who seem to know what to do with their characters.

I loved the old Fantastic Four movies, but it makes sense to reboot due to the new Marvel Movieversum.But just after a few minutes I realized, this movie will get worse and worse. Not only that Susan Storm appears to be too meek, also why for heavens sake did the change the family history and why for crying out loud is Johnny suddenly black? Also I miss the more mature Reed and the back ground story of Ben being a high ranked pilot makes much more sense than him being used as a tool of the military - he is not as dumb, as he is portrayed in the crappy reboot!Hopefully they wont continue this story line!

There was nothing that was actually fantastic about the Fantastic Four. During the start of the movie, I thought that the film wasn't that bad and the critics were exaggerating... I was wrong. Everything was gradually getting worse. The plot wasn't that bad. I liked the idea of the film, but it was just executed badly. The script and the writing was just plain stupid and most of the characters were like robots, they were emotionless.Marvel movies are known for their incredible action sequences, but they obviously failed here. For an action movie, there was a shortage of action. Every action scene was just hilarious. Does Josh Trank want it to be a comedy?The worst part of the film were the special effects, the effects were nearly worse than Sharknado. It was excruciatingly painful to watch Reed Richards use his powers. I hope the sequel doesn't continue. Fantastic Four just wasted 122 million dollars.

753,kmlnj9483,Another useless reboot attempt,2,1 August 2020,"This was good enough to actually finish watching, and the characters were okay, but it was nowhere near as good as the original.
This was just another failed reboot attempt that shouldn't have bothered.",Fantastic Four
754,Metallicon,Not nearly as bad as people say; behind the scenes issues abound though...,6,18 August 2015,"I liked the movie. I know it's a bit blasphemous to state in the general fan community, but I certainly didn't hate it, and I certainly don't think that it deserves the amount of vitriol that is being throw at it both in the media and from comic ""fans."" Just from reading over the comments here and elsewhere it is clear that many (not all) don't understand that this is clearly based on the Ultimate version (Marvel's reboot) of the comic that was launched in the early 2000's (or whenever). When I learned this was the case, I quickly read the first 2 collected graphic novels just to see where this was going. I understand most people see F4 as the 1960s, gee- wiz group that is considered Marvel's first family, but in fact, the Ultimate version is a very different idea indeed, and to be fair, the movie ""mostly"" follows the blueprint from that version, particularly the first third (and in my opinion) the best part of the released film, including the teleportation (kids and science fair), and Doom being part of the experiment. That's not to say that there aren't problems (Clobbering time, how they get to the other dimension, etc) but for the most part, it's there. It's funny though that I never really intended to see this after the initial reviews hit saying it was so horrible, but I went just to see if I could see the behind-the-scenes-mess that occurred in its creation. Therefore, I subconsciously played, ""spot the wig"" throughout the film, just to see if I could get a sense of the movie Trank wanted to make, and what the studio seemingly insisted be re- shot/added. What I found was this:Trank's scenes (what I'm assuming are Sue's real hair) are part of a reasonably well-done Sci-Fi take on the Ultimate comic F4. These are by far the best scenes in the film. They are darker, more serious in tone, and much better acted than other portions of the film. There's almost a sense of Sci-Fi horror to what he seemed to be going for that I was really digging. Again, all seemingly Act I. When Act II hits (One Year Later), this seems to be an amalgamation of Trank and studio meddling. It should have been longer, more fleshed out, and (in light of today's reports around the net) desperately needed that scene where Ben was wrecking stuff to solidify the changes over the time passed; likewise, I would have like to have seen more of Ben's pursuit of Reed and the emotional breakdown the should have happened as well, not just their conversation of the return trip. The wig shows up in this portion of the film, and then disappears quite often. What I also began to notice how different Miles Teller's take on Reed was. Under Trank, (again, what I assume was Trank's direction) he seemed much more invested and emotionally driven; however, any scene in which he appeared that wreaked of meddling, his forced heroic delivery took me right out of his portrayal of the character. There also seemed to be far too much unneeded plot downloading about powers and training with Sue and Johnny (which I thought Jordan did fine with what he was given btw) that could have been more focused on Reed's return and how these characters reacted to his presence. Apparently, a year is no big deal, not even for Doom.I wish they would have spent more time with Doom. Trailers and (again) internet babble indicate there was at least a scene where Reed confronted him prior to him busting heads – which, I though was pretty great and seemed to be filmed more in the style of Trank's original vision than what it eventually leads to. And while this original scene probably would have fell into the trope of the villain telegraphing his plan to the heroes, it felt it would have at least made the payoff worth it. The payoff we get, meanwhile, is pretty terrible. Act III: Forced dialog, missing villain motivation, questionable Mr. Fantastic effects, and that damn wig. I don't know if Trank actually filmed an ending or not, but clearly this was all done in re-shoots, and it kinda sucks. It just felt like they were trying far too hard to take the hard tone of the first hour (which, in my mind is not something I would not show a 10-year-old) and turn it into the Fox version of Avengers (safe for all ages). Kinsberg should be ashamed if he truly is responsible for this ending. If anything, I would at least want to know what the original plan was for the final battle of this movie was, filmed or not.I like the epilogue with the smash cut to the name. Strangely enough, some of these scenes feature Sue's real hair. Overall, I would give it a 6.5 out of 10. Definite potential, but squandered through (what I perceive) as meddling. I do want to see Trank's original vision, whatever is salvageable, and I would hope, to at least regain something financially, the studio would offer this on DVD – though I doubt it, because Fox is a pain. After all, I waited nearly 15 years to get a solid extended cut of Alien 3. I also think this is salvageable; if they find a decent writer with the correct handle of tone, I think they can mine a good sequel from this. I like each of the actors, but they need a better story and execution to work with, including more inter-play between the characters, which I did miss, especially between Johnny and Ben. I think overall, the best chance they have at this is to form a partnership with Marvel (like Sony and Spider-Man), but not re-cast, just move forward.",Fantastic Four
755,moviego3r,Better than what reviewers say.,8,16 February 2016,"Let's face it, the reason why many people don't like this movie is because they simply didn't like the casting. At every single review bashing the movie they always comment on how bad the casting was.I like that the creators of this movie went with a more serious, dark approach instead of the old super hero versus the evil villain who wants to conquer the world plot. So just like all GOOD superhero movies they extend and concentrate on the origins of their super- human abilities, and not just a quick lab accident and move on with a non related reason for them to defeat the evil villain.Also, who says they can't be older in the next film (Mr. Fantastic with gray hair and all) as so many have complained as well.But unfortunately because of people complaining on how 'bad' this movie was...

757,som274,bad last moment screenplay writing,4,8 August 2015,"i think the first and the last part of the movie was written by different people. since there was a gradual buildup to something that i was not able to witness at the climax , it seemed like not only it was rushed but also the brainchild of different screenwriters. i really liked how it was difficult for them to cope up with the new found powers, it seemed human . but then all of a sudden they are working for the government , such loose strings can be found everywhere throughout. the finale makes this even more profound as doom tries to escape to the other dimension taking the world with him , 'there is only doom' pfff needs a little more convincing than that to actually come up with a good excuse to start killing people all of a sudden , this movie had a good start but only tangled into much more chaos as the film started rolling.",Fantastic Four
758,rhknight2008,Not at all as bad as people are saying,8,12 August 2015,"OK this movie is a seriously bad rap.It is nowhere near that bad and I think the cast did a really good job. I liked what the script did to show how long Reed and Ben knew each other, and I liked that Sue Storm was not the weak and vapid incarnation of earlier attempts. Not only was she described as smart, she was written as smart.I also liked that it actually felt like a movie about the man that created the Fantastic 4, Mr. Reed Richards. The actor took the role and made it work, showing us all of Reed's developing strengths, as well as his foibles and humanity.Overall, I thought the play of the government seizing control of the team, the work being forced upon them to open up the next portal, and the trials of the team were well done.BUT...I think an extra 20-25 minutes to develop Johnny and Ben would have been useful. I think they could actually have left Doom out of the movie entirely and introduced, oh...Annihilus!! since he is a pan-dimensional baddie as the chief protagonist, would have made much more sense.Which leads me to say that the extra 20-25 minutes could actually have made the final battle more ...ahem...'Fantastic', and been a proper lead-in to the group remaining together in the end.So, overall for a movie that seems to have it's legion of detractors, I for one will admit I could have used a bit MORE of the movie...as long as it was done to the same level as the first 90 minutes.",Fantastic Four

My true rating for this flick is a solid ""7"". Yes, the re-shoots are obvious. Yes, there are flow issues with the story line. However, kudos go out for a fresh approach to this well-known story and a movie that delivered solid acting performances overall. I do not regret the money or time spent watching this film, and it will be added to my personal collection. It's a movie worthy of Marvel though admittedly watered down a bit. For all the Fox haters out there, I'll remind you that Fox has done an outstanding job with X-Men overall. The F4 brand is in good hands and, regardless of the box office performance, I'm hopeful of seeing a stronger sequel.This film is worth seeing at least once. The humor was well timed and had me laughing out loud on several occasions, more than Ant-Man did anyway. Oh wait... does that touch a nerve? I know I know... Marvel can do no wrong as long as they stick within the standard MCU that they have created. I can't help but wonder what the naysayers will think of Deadpool.

Who refers to Dr. Doom as ""ice man"" and he loved ""rock man.""",Fantastic Four
764,n_hatzigeorgiou,Disappointing,3,11 August 2015,"Terrible movie! I ' be seen the last two movies and although they were not something to thrill me they were certainly better than this.. The plot was bad, the script was unimaginative and the reality of the movie was not even close to what was shown in comics way back then. When we see revamps, using younger actors, we usually get new stories that put characters into new perspective.. This approach didn't even come close.. I understand that the fantastic four characters are difficult to fill in the big screen. The nature of their powers is something that cannot be realistic in conception and visualization but for someone like me who is a fantastic four fan since his childhood , this looks just.. Disappointing..",Fantastic Four
765,Fel_Orc90,A Bit Crappy!,4,7 August 2015,"I'm going to start about what disappointed me the most.First the Introduction/preparation is 80% of the movie.Second about 20 mins into the movie you can already foresee the climax of the film a very cliché ending and corny! (honestly, its like they became lazy it became a childish ending all of a sudden.)I honestly thought that the ant-man was going to be crap and very stupid, but to my surprise it became a very creative way to represent the ant-man not just children but also very satisfying enough for the adults to absorb.But this film my God! It became one of my worst movie this 2015.My Love for the FF comics kept my rating up, but if this is the first time I see the movie it's a 1/10 for me. I think the director is just to young too create a eye catching movie for all ages. I mean the 'Chronicle' was good and simple, but this one. Well, his inexperience lead the plot to a deep whole that could've been a very great comeback for the FF franchise.",Fantastic Four
766,loveoo83-870-401552,So sad,2,7 August 2015,"This film was just sad; there was not even a real development of the characters. Just here they are and this is what they can do in voice-over monotone. With Reed and Ben to be best friends, it felt like Ben was just there so Reed would not get hurt. They had no development, no ark just here is a text from Reed to Ben like here look what I did and then a phone call to say come over and let's take out my new toy for a spin before the government takes it. Then the three seconds of I miss you brother from Sue to Johnny was like they were just friends and not brother and sister. Then after the accident not one person asked about Victor, it was like oh his gone and was odd so we don't need to talk about him. Then when the get Reed back no one talks about what he can do, just lock him in a room and we have to take care of Victor. It was like go to your room Reed, you have been a bad boy, your grounded.The whole movie was just slow, till the end where the main battle was like oh here is like five minutes to become a team and take down the bad guy. It was just sad that was how it was like we will work with, not for the government or else and here is a big base just for you. Then there was no post credit scene just we worked 15,000 hours or your entertainment and it took a lot of people. It almost felt like you need to like this or else. Not the please no piracy like they were going for. So over all it was just bad.",Fantastic Four

I'm not a big superhero movie buff and have not seen the previous F4 movies either. After seeing the scathing reviews, I was expecting the to experience the worst movie I've ever seen.To my surprise, I saw a fun and excellent movie. This movie blew the doors off of ""Interstellar"". I was throughly entertained throughout. Not the greatest movie ever, but certainly not deserving of all the terrible reviews either. And of course, the soundtrack is great (I knew that ahead of time; already have downloaded the soundtrack).Give F4 a chance and go in with an open mind, and don't listen to the whiners.",Fantastic Four
768,johnniecmarose,Grading curve has been set to high.,7,4 January 2016,"Peoples expectations were to high for this take on the FF4. I'm pretty sure that, the general populace(non-comic book reader) remembers the first FF4 movies, then there's the comic book readers who think everything needs to follow the books and then there's the true blue comic book followers, that know, anything can happen and/or change from issue to issue. This movie was a good restart for the FF4. Yes, it doesn't follow the original start of the FF4, but as far as a fresh start for them, this isn't bad. Here's the thing with Disney/Marvel, they already know where they're going with their story. Spider-man just happen to work out, to where they could work him in(it's not like he has a base of operations and such). The way things are right now is to look at all of them being in different realities, just waiting to be combined. This FF4 is a a new start for them and they're young(most of the characters they(FF4, X-men and Avengers) are playing, have been around for the last 50+ years and yet(for the most part) they are portrayed by the same actor. None of the actors who are portraying the characters they are now(except the younger actors, like in X-men or The FF4) will be able to portray them in 5 or more years. We have a new Professor X and Magneto(out Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. Plus Hugh Jackman and Robert Downey Jr. are done with their rolls). So let's look at what we have here, The Avengers(Spider-man), Shield, and the Inhumans. The Fantastic Four and all the mutants. We have a FF4 that can open a door to another reality, same as the agents of Shield and the Asgardians. We also have a Quicksilver and Scarlet Which(in two realities). Once the Infinity War is done(Disney/Marvel) and then the X-men: Age of Apocalypses(Fox/Marvel), they will probably be looking for a way to restart everything(including the FF4). Perfect time to have the FF4 connect realities with the Avengers reality and then have there be a House of M(non comic book readers need to look that up). The Scarlet Which in Fox's X-men(I know she's not there yet, but she will be) snaps and changes all of reality and BAM!, you have the new Marvel Universe. Some of the actors we have now(to tie things together) and new actors for other things. Just like ""Star Wars"", the cannon you know don't mean s@#t. There will be new ways to do things and new stories. If things were just like the way they were written in a novel or in a comic book, things would be really boring, since you'd know how everything was going to happen. Sometimes that's cool, like LOTR or Harry Potter, because you get to see on screen all that you imagined and more, but a comic book is already visual and they've done so many story lines that it's cool to see somethings you know, but even better to see something new.",Fantastic Four
769,juilliard2021,"It wasn't awful, but it needs so much work.",4,6 September 2015,"Honestly, as far as the acting goes, most of the characters were a bit dry and spoke in monotone for most/all of the movie. For the characters' line of work the monotone kind of fits, so that's not my problem. It was a short movie that really slow pacing at the beginning and tried to play catch up at the end. Maybe had the ending been a little more epic, they could have gotten away with it, but it wasn't. It seemed to skip progress, a lot. Things that likely would have happened in a three hour movie just sort of randomly happened as if there was something leading up to it. They tried to fix the slow pacing multiple times throughout the movie, and it was far too obvious. All in all, if it comes out with a sequel, I'll give it a second chance. They'd better impress me this time because most people, just like me, aren't exactly ""three strikes, you're out!""",Fantastic Four

And may I say that all websites are giving 3/5 which isn't bad and on DS they are hating on it but give it 3/5 and they say its awful but they also praised the hell out of MI5 but only gave that 3/5 so it cool to hate this perfectly good film.",Fantastic Four
771,laurablane99,Fantastic Failure,4,6 August 2015,"Abysmal. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a film in my life. It was such a disappointment that even its predecessor excelled in entertaining its audience.You would expect that a film of this genre, typically a Marvel film, would have an awesome and visually amazing fight scene between the heroes and the villain, as well as the big build up to it; but this film seriously lacked this. You'd think that at least the last 1/3 of the film would be setting up Doom and the Fantastic 4's plan to stop him, as well as a big epic fight scene; but no not in this film, what you get is a 5 minute fight scene at the end and then it's all over. With the film being a reboot I completely expected the beginning of the film to set up the characters and to show them before they got their powers, but this part takes up about 75% of the film; with a further 15% explaining how they are wanted and are being used by the military. This leaves a flimsy 5% of the film where we finally get to see some action, and the other 5% is where we get to here some incredibly cheesy lines that are so forced its almost embarrassing. It truly feels like the writers and Josh Trank spent so long on the 'beginning' of the film, that they completely forgot about the ending, and upon realisation they quickly wrote an ending up and filmed it over a couple of days, then hoped the special effects would make it seem better than it was, which didn't work; therefore the main attraction of the film only lasted about 5 minutes. Not to mention that the action was the only thing advertised in the trailers – so we were completely misled.It's such a shame that Trank made such a disaster of a film because all of the actors were in fact fantastic. My 4 stars are not for the film, but they are for the actors and their ability to keep the film afloat. I hope that these actors – the 4 (Miles Teller, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Mara, & Jamie Bell), Doom (Toby Kebbell), as well as Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), and Dr. Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) do not get a bad rep because of Trank's failure; they were all amazing and were the only thing stopping me from walking out of the cinema before the film had finished. Josh Trank should be ashamed and he should definitely not be called back for the second instalment – if a second one is even made. And to make it even worse there wasn't even a post credit scene! Call yourself a Marvel film?! I wouldn't recommend wasting your money to go and see this film in the cinema, instead use it to go buy the first Fantastic Four film, it'll keep you more entertained than this reboot will, and it wont leave you as disappointed at the end.",Fantastic Four

The good points are the young actors, they really did give it their all, the CGI effects are amazing, and the potential for a better, proper Fantastic 4 film in the future, and the character design of Dr Doom, which in my humble opinion was an amazing, fresh, and even scarier than the previous incarnation. The bad point were the cold military cliché characters, the seemingly completely CGI Thing, who's animations are almost cheap Japanese fantasy film style, the lack of scenes with the Invisible Woman, and lastly the lack of real world implications of these events, no public announcements, news forecasts etc, public reactions to the events and the teams powers, which kind of isolated the entire story from the modern world, great potential, lacks enough heart....",Fantastic Four

But, i was wrong. he's not a good choice for this movie.The cast - it's perfect. I mean, Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell, and Toby Kebbell? They're perfect for each character that they played! But, Trank didn't to them justice.So, all in all, this is a great movie. I recommend it, for comic book fans out there.

774,Wavey75,Borders on a comedy parody,1,13 September 2015,"After reading about all the negativity surrounding the release of this recent reboot of the Marvel franchise, I decided to give it a go for myself.In short, there's two hours of my life I'm never getting back.Spoiler alert!!!Good points: The actor who plays Reed Richards got his ""nerd act"" very well. The special effects were good.Bad points: Sue Storms hair colour changed from bright blonde to mousy brown several times throughout the film, displaying zero continuity in the filming process overall. At some points,when it does change to Blonde, it has also changed in size, and is slightly askew, which is a sign of a bad fitting wig, often a sign of a parody for humorous purposes.Although there was a mention of adoption to explain how Johnny & Sue Storm are siblings, some more back story could have been added without increasing any screen time.The Ben Grimm transformation was okay and well, but to go from a puny Jamie Bell to this force to be reckoned with that can throw tanks around like they were sponges, for him to have a voice that sounds like a six-year-old girl completely ruined the movie.In the plot, Reed Richards runs away when they return home with their superpowers and he apologizes to his best friend Ben Grimm, saying ""I'm sorry, I'll fix this"", this guy who is a Scientist and Explorer, decides to run away for a whole year without contact? In my opinion this is completely out of Reed Richards' character and must be some gross mistake on either the writers or studios part. Now I know why the director didn't want to be associated with it, or something like that.I have nothing against any of the actors in this movie and I was looking forward to it, but if you are a marvel fan, for your own, good,pretend it never happened.I am stunned and amazed that there is a sequel planned for this franchise reboot, and I would urge Marvel to deny the permission for this franchise to continue it needs to be stamped out like a weed in a patio. PLease do not let this disaster continue, it will tar the Marvel universe with this awful project that resembles amateur hour. naught out of 10, avoid this movie, unless your only other option is death.",Fantastic Four

This however, deserves to be lauded as the worst attempt at a superhero film since Daredevil. The origin has been shredded to something that resembles nothing to do with the source material, the casting is way off on all characters barring invisible girl and the storyline is so weak and poorly managed that you have no empathy or real reason to care about the characters. It makes Power Rangers movie look well written. Don't get me wrong, all the actors are actors I like. I'm just saddened that they were saddled with this monstrosity of a script. Nothing gets explained.....ever, at all. Powers, reasons for people being where they are, who they are, it all just gets swept under the carpet so they can continue holding the rights to something Fox have now botched on FOUR separate occasions.

Although action was too quick for its own good, the connections between the characters were well not only well acted but also well developed. In comparison to the original Fantastic Four series, this film offered a more mature perspective the previous lacked. The film progressed through character relations throughout the story arc which, in a sense, connected to family ordeals. Audience were able to experience the growing bond between Reed and Ben; the father-son conflict; hinted history between Susan and Victor; etc. Ultimately, we are left knowing that a team is established. Overall, the film left me entertained, however lacking Fantastic Four's comic background. As a reboot, it brought something new to the table. Yes, the film's action could have been more, but if given a chance, a sequel could further dive into a strong formed franchise.",Fantastic Four

After watching it i can see that i was proved right. The film lacked a structured plot that made logical sense (as much as a superhero film can) it was too short for a superhero film this meant it didn't have a chance to fully develop. It skipped out the major part of the original film, where you learnt about the superhero and how they deal with their powers when they're first given to them. The ending was awful and one of the worst that i've seen for a superhero film. I won't give it away but it was anticlimactic.

The blame is totally on the writers as this script/storyline remains dull and one dimensional throughout. The Thing only throws two punches in two fight scenes and one of those was smashing into a tree. The synopsis says they learn to use their abilities when actually no real learning or struggle happens for any of the hero's. The character building is nonexistent and no real love of the characters is formed. The brief glimpse of a past relationship between the girl and victor was so quickly grazed over that when doom says the line "" we could have had something"" simply had no meaning. The writers, obviously assuming, that seasoned fantastic four fans could fill in the enormous plot and character flaws/holes of this movie and might enjoy it. Whereas beginners would simply be in such a state of boredom pillows would have been handed out to them at the cinema. The old movies weren't great but the dialogue, (funny, cocky and sexy) characters were much better than this one. I do not blame the actors one bit miles teller is a funny and at times sincere actor but when you hand a crap script to even the best actors its going to be a very poor film.

Mostly in the action and also the fact that this is something different as to what we've seen before, and we briefly get glimpses of something that could have been great for this franchise, but as I said, it is brief and only a glimpse. there is a difference between potential and reality, and this movie had potential to be great, but in reality this is an awful installment to an already incredibly underwhelming set of movies.I'll keep it short, as its really not worth delving into something that clearly had very little effort put into it. Almost nothing works in this movie. Comedy is atrocious, the drama is boring, the characters at some point in the movie do something completely uncharacteristic of what has been built up. The CGI is even appalling, no wonder Fox didn't release the official budget of the movie to the public! It's laughable. I will not spoil anything but Doom is possibly the worst villain I have ever seen in my life, yes I am aware Mr Freeze exists, and Jim Carreys riddler.

786,craig-mahagan,Not so Fantastic 4 theaters,4,6 August 2015,"Fantastic 4 (2015)I went into this movie not really expecting anything of value. Though it followed the comic series Ultimate Fantastic Four more then the typical series. Now that I have seen it, I feel that it didn't fall to short of my expectations. In this 20th Century Fox version of the popular Marvel Comic super hero team. We follow young genius Reed Richards (Miles Miller) and his child hood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell), working together to create the first teleporter. Ben unlike most versions of the character was not the jock, who protected Reed, but a kid who lived in a junkyard with his mother and his elder brother who picked on him. Reed as per usual, is a prodigy. When they take Reeds design for a teleporter to their school science fair, that's when the meet Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey) and his adopted daughter Susan Storm (Kate Mara). He takes Reed to his think tank at the Baxter Building in New York City. Enter the villain Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell). A trouble maker and obsessed with fixing the world, by destroying it. Next we meet Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) Franklins rebellious son who has a chip on his shoulder when it comes to his father. The quartet of young adults work tirelessly to create an inter-dimensional transporter, which would allow them to visit this new dimension. As is typical, enter the corrupt, businessman and the military. Who attempt to take away the honor of the first people to travel to the new dimension? Well kids will be kids and without permission, Reed, Johnny, Ben and Victor take it upon themselves to take back their glory. It doesn't go well and it leaves one of the four ""Doomed"", and the other three forever changed. Oh and don't forget about Sue who brings the three back and altered herself.Though I did enjoy watching this movie, I found it to be a let down. The ending seemed to feel like it was rushed. I have mixed feelings on the choice of cast. For one, Bell did not do Ben Grimm very well. Kate did a good job as Susan Storm while Jordan, after some bad hype about him being African American Johnny Storm, did a wonderful job as Johnny. It is not the first time that a Marvel character changed race, dare I mention Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, also an Ultimate Marvel change. Miller was also a good choice as Reed Richards. I give this movie a 3 out of 5. I would suggest you see this in theaters only if you're a die hard fan of the Ultimate FF comic series, other then that just wait tell it comes out to DVD.",Fantastic Four
787,mathiasquintero-200-696579,A waste...,5,16 August 2015,"Let me be clear. At the start I enjoyed the movie. It started off with a few clichés and wasn't particularly creative when it came to the plot or the dialogue. But it was still OK. I thought it was an interesting take on the story and it certainly felt new. (I didn't read the comics but it didn't sound like something I had heard about before.)And that is exactly what's wrong with this movie. I had so much potential!!!The start was so good, and the exposition felt alright. Like I said, filled with clichés, but still very enjoyable.And then right after the introduction is done, you look at the time and remember the runtime and think, well what the hell is going to happen in so little time. Turns out, not much... You get this dumbed down action that's not really clear or makes a lot of sense. They weren't clear enough about Doom's intentions. It feels like he's bad, because, yeah he's a pretentious asshole and very bad... Just go with it...This movie's pacing changed too drastically, to the point in which you suddenly have absolutely no idea what's going on. That's the problem. They were afraid of the movie running for too long, felt solid about the start and kept it that way (which is fine), and shortened everything else (not fine).I could talk about the dialogue that felt stupid at times, but that's not really what I though about after the movie. At some points I would hear them and go ""well that was stupid"", but it's not the takeaway. They could have fixed the pacing and have the same dialogue and this movie could have made a 7 - 7.5 in my book. But no, it's still weird...",Fantastic Four

That is my first problem, the other problems are as follows: Nothing happened in the film it literally a trailer for the equal, ""Doom"" was laughably horrible and his motives where like ""You left me in the Negative Zone and you want to use that to help earth?!"" Nope just nope. The ""love triangle"" was completely forced, this CGI was laughed at when i saw it, NO ONE TALKED ABOUT ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

To be honest, I have no idea what I was even watching. Why would they waste half the movie just to show us how they built the machine. They wasted another 1/4 of the movie showing how they had become lab rats, and the last 10 min was a fight scene that made zero connection to my love for the comic. I would rather watch ANY of the other fantastic four movies over this any day. I do NOT suggest anyone waste their HARD EARNED money on this waste of time, half made, junk sized, piece of crap. Please feel free to down vote this and mark as spam and spend your money and anything else. Just here to say that this movie sucked worse than the final episode of clannad after story.",Fantastic Four
791,jessellowe,Why...,1,12 September 2015,"Before I begin, I'm only giving this a vote of 1.0 out of 10 because I can't pick 0.This movie is terrible. The acting, the story, and the awkward use of iconic characters is depressing. I know this has been said over and over, but why... seriously... why is Victor Von Doom, the single best villain in the Marvel universe depicted as a weird emo hacker stereotype? It's the least inspired film I've ever seen which is amazing considering I've actually watched the 1994 Chris Elliot film ""Cabin Boy""who's hallucinogenic cupcakes was more creative than this turd blossom.Please don't watch this movie.",Fantastic Four
792,simplyredqueen,Not so Fantastic Four,5,15 August 2015,"I have to admit that my expectations for this movie were never very high. The trailers did nothing for me and Fox had already screwed up the F4 twice. But I was determined to watch it. Even after the terrible reviews, I still wanted to see it for myself. And I have to say that it's not horrible.The first, say, 50 minutes of the movie are actually pretty good. You get to know most of these characters and their motivations. I especially liked the friendship between Reed and Ben. I also liked how Dr. Storm took in these kids and mentored them. When we were seeing that, the movie made a lot of sense. And then 1 year later. That's when things start to fall apart. From that point on, the movie just rushed through the story and it had no interest whatsoever in making us care about these characters or anything that was happening. It seemed like there were parts of the story missing. That wasn't a team, or a family or anything, really.The villain here is just terrible. Doom has no development, no motivation and his look is just laughable. One of the greatest villains in comics was turned into a pathetic shadow of himself. Toby Kebbell is a very good actor, but he is so wasted here! In fact, all actors are. Teller, Mara, Jordan and Bell do their best, but when you have nothing to work with, even that might not be enough.A lot has been said about Josh Trank's relationship with the studio: was it his fault, was it Fox's fault? I don't know. But it's clear that something happened. This is not the movie we were meant to have. I feel like there's a good movie somewhere in there. It's a shame we didn't get to see it.Now, what should Fox do with the F4? The way I see it, there are six possible solutions:1- Do a sequel. I think that would be a big mistake. Even if they could take the good stuff in this movie and go with it, who would see the sequel? After the big flop this will become, who would even want it? 2- Try again in a few years. That would also be a mistake. They tried three times and it failed. Why would the fourth time be different? 3- Incorporate these characters in the X-Men movies. That would be disastrous. Fox is actually doing a good job with the X-Men. To bring the characters from a failed movie into a franchise that is actually doing quite well, would destroy them both completely. It has disaster written all over it.4- Do a Sony-type deal with Marvel. Because Sony did a deal with Marvel, we get to have Spiderman in the MCU. Sony still owns the movie rights to him, but they now sort of share him with Marvel. Many fans proposed something like this. I'm not sure I like it. This would mean that Fox would still have control over the movies. And while Sony has actually done decent Spiderman movies, Fox didn't do one F4 movie that can even be considered good. They have failed. They should have no say whatsoever in a movie about these characters.5- Sell them back to Marvel. I would like to see this happening, I really would. But I doubt that it will. Marvel doesn't need the F4. They have a successful cinematic universe without them. Would they like to have them back? I'm sure they would. But they're not going to pay millions of dollars for them. And Fox wouldn't want to sell them either. That would the same as admitting they have failed. And they won't do that.6- Do nothing. This is what I think will happen. Fox will put the F4 in a corner and simply not use them for anything. After a few years without using them, the movie rights will come back to Marvel. That's what happened with Daredevil and I'm pretty sure that's what will happen to the F4.",Fantastic Four

But the story line is well thought out in parts (ie, the first half of the film) as to make us understand the different the rolls they all play.The main area of this film that was missing was a good/great action scenes. The dramatic or fight seems in the movie were a bit of a let down. They really just didn't get going for me. And in the main fight scene soon as it started, it seemed to be over just as quick. They needed to go the extra mile with this film 1. To shock you a bit more. 2. To make us feel that we were on there side from the start. 3. To make the bad guys just as bad as DoomThere are a few funny parts in the movie, and the casting was great. All of the specialist effects were spot on. I even enjoyed the story line that took us up to the point were they got there powers. They just need to push the boat out a bit more. Maybe have a little more grit in the script.It may not seem that I liked the film, and I came out of the cinema thinking I would give it a higher rating than I have. It does need an other film to set it back on track if they get the chance. I just wanted to see more bang for my buck.",Fantastic Four
794,henryjonathanr,Meh,5,25 June 2020,"I don't think the movie was horrible as a whole. If I judge it as straight sci-fi, it's not that bad of a movie, the ending notwithstanding. Unfortunately, because I am at least a little familiar with the source material, it just didn't work for me.
I thought the production quality and acting performances were mostly good. Unfortunately, the story itself is the weakness here. The buildup is long and drawn out. By the time the protagonists got their powers and the action was supposed to start, it felt like the director was like, ""OK, we gotta wrap this up.""
Reid Richards's brief disappearance from the group had no bearing on the rest of the story. All four of them could've been exploring their abilities and going on missions to build their chemistry by the time Dr. Doom appeared. It would've filled the story with more action sequences, which were sorely lacking.",Fantastic Four

It's kind of a remake of the old fantastic four but I LOVE IT ;3 This is the kind of movies I've been looking for!! and let me say that were a lot to choose from. So thank you for making this. I really liked the fighting scenes and the backstory to it all. Also, it was well acted. Don't know why so many people hate this so much. (maybe because of the remake of the old fantastic four) Both movies are awesome but the special effects in this movie were better in my opinion! :D The length of the movie is not too long and not too short. The surroundings were well made and beautiful. And yes please make another movie following this story line! I would love it. <3",Fantastic Four
796,tonyrouse,Not as bad as everyone says.,6,19 August 2015,"Fantastic Four 2015 is a good movie. Josh Trank show us a new view on Fantastic Four. This review going to be short but it contains the most important aspects. Movie wasn't bad, it was a NEW Fantastic Four and it's not as bad as everyone says. It is not a comics one at all, but it's good. One of the worse things is that Doom wasn't actually a true Dr.Doom, he was like a villain who appear as fast as he die, so I can say that there was only name of Dr.Doom. Movie was very fast. First part of the film was good, perfect, but second and third, when action starts to take place - that was too fast! 1 hour 40 minutes - it is not that time that gotta be in movie like that. Trank is a good director but must fight more for his projects. I vote 10 just because everyone think it is bad, but it's actually not. Go to the cinema and make your own opinion.",Fantastic Four
797,twistedguy,Objectively Bad in Every Conceivable Way,1,22 May 2016,"Not treading any new ground by pointing out that this iteration of the Fantastic Four is bad. I never hated the 2005 and 2007 movies; they were significantly flawed, but FELT like Fantastic Four movies. This does not. It is bad. Not bad in the ""I didn't like it"" sort of way, but bad in a ""fails to achieve success in any objective metric by which a movie can be made""We have come so far and filmmakers and producers have learned so much about successfully translating comic books to film in the intervening decade since the first Fantastic Four movie, that this move being as incoherent, dull, and miserably bleak as it is, is confusing and inexcusable. Fox themselves have set the bar so high with the success of Deadpool, that making a comic book movie ""work"" (even if it's a bit plodding or messy, I'm looking at you Batman v Superman) shouldn't be all that much of a struggle anymore.What can be said about it that hasn't already been said? The plot: threadbare and so dreadfully ""by the numbers"" that it's insulting to the audience's intelligence. The pacing: not just uneven, but utterly dull. The characters: poorly written and deviating so far from their comic book source material (and I'm not talking about the non-issue of the Human Torch being black), that they're unrecognizable. The writing: far too cringe-worthy and inconsistent within itself to create enough of a framework for any concept, bit of action, or line of dialogue to be successful. The cast: may or may not be good in their roles, but it's impossible to evaluate, given the nightmarish hot mess this movie is.So there you go. Fantastic Four trips and falls over its own disastrous and labored production. This take on Marvel's first family was likely doomed from the start, so will likely need another reboot, or a few more years to stew to let the rights revert back to Marvel.",Fantastic Four

But a superhero movie just can't be bad nowadays"". Oh, trust me. It can be that bad. And regardless of sticking true to the comic books or not, the movie was a bad superhero movie. A bad movie in general. The actors are good. I've seen them in other movies. But in this one? Really average performance. I'm not sure if the dialogues were just terrible, or it just lacked chemistry between actor and character. And between the 4 of them. They didn't really fit. And the fight scenes made me feel like I was watching a movie made on the 90's. We are used to these great movies nowadays. Action, science, humor, flirting.

800,zythain,One of them worst films fox have produced 👎,3,6 August 2015,"I went into this film ""cautiously optimistic"", meaning I thought it could be good but didn't want to get too exited because ,as you will see this film is Horrendous, and u didn't what to be too disappointed! The film doesn't deserve to be shown in cinemas, maybe, (I said maybe) if it was a sad Monday night and you saw the film was on TV and you watched 10 minutes of it you might not despise it. Emphasis on the maybe The film only runs for 100 minutes leaving you very confused when it ends. Is it over? Really that's it? None of the characters have any arcs! You could maybe argue that the thing has a smidgen of an arc, however I would say that's just what development in character. The film is slow and boring almost through then right towards the end you get to see some of doom, and I find that doom is the only slightly entertaining part! He does some cool stuff!Then the cliché's come RAINING DOWN! I saw the film with a supernerd like myself and every 3 seconds we where telling each over what the character was going to say and we got it spot on every time! The scripting makes me vomit in my mouth! In conclusion I wouldn't watch this rushed piece of garbage if you payed me!",Fantastic Four
801,TrueButterFtw,Not as bad as critics make it out to be,5,6 August 2015,"Despite what all the ego heavy critics are saying, the movie wasn't that bad. The first half was absolutely amazing, the second half...not so much. The second half of the movie seemed extremely rushed and definitely had issues (plot, motivation, etc.) Maybe if the movie was a little bit longer it could've worked out much better. I think that the movie deserves a sequel in which it will redeem itself and fix the mistakes that this movie had. It was still entertaining and in my opinion is better than 2005's Fantastic Four. Plus, from my 9 year old brothers perspective, the movie was absolutely awesome and a thrilling introduction to the Fantastic Four.",Fantastic Four
802,djleeprice,Disappointing and Rushed could of been so much more,4,5 August 2015,"So as most people i was excited to this reboot as the old films were not fantastic if i am being honest. The first thing about this film was the running time 100mins, by the time they explained the story and introduced the characters and what happened to them it left you with say 15mins for them to conclude the film, which obviously the Four find doom etc and rid him off the planet with a poor action scene. This film could of been so much more its sets the scene and the plot, the character of doom could have been one of the best villains due to his powers and background but is it completely wasted, for him to appear after what's happened in the film to an almighty climax of a 10min show! This film really does feel rushed followed by some cheesy lines at the end of the film and no spoiler after the credits like pretty much all marvel films. If there was another hour added to the film and the action was dragged out a bit more this could have been so much better. But saying this people will still watch this due to the franchise so i suppose the film makers is in pocket, even tho too watch its a rushed film with a disappointing ending.",Fantastic Four
803,mikalmoore-52642,Exactly what Fantastic Four is Scientist/Explorers,7,6 August 2015,"It has a great story capturing all of the members of the Fantastic 4 as a person. They show their Love of science (Victor Von Doom, Sue Storm, Reed Richards), Recklessness (Johnny Storm), and Loyalty (Ben Grimm). While the origin story changed from them getting the power from cloud to ""Planet Zero."" The only knock is The ending that just kinda fell flat as they seemingly destroy Doom. At the same time seeing as they have had the sequel set for a while it did a tremendous job of setting up the next movie that will likely show a Reed-Sue Love story then. All in All a great movie that was marketed the wrong way. Trailers will have you thinking its an action movie but in fact it is a Adventure/Fantasy Movie and a very good one at that. The MAIN thing to know is that the Fantastic 4 are not the true definition of Super Heroes but more of Scientists and Adventurers.",Fantastic Four
804,stan-80497,Nothing fantastic.,4,5 August 2015,"Very little about this contemporary retelling of the Fantastic Four is fantastic. It's dark, broody and muddled. The retelling lacks the essence of what made the Fantastic Four so great in comics—a sense of family.There is absolutely zero chemistry between the 4 main characters (or actors, for that matter). Despite the furtive glances and lingering camera shots, there's zero romantic chemistry between Reed and Sue (nor is there any sizzle in the longing glances from Victor to Sue.) There's no sibling anything between Johnny and Sue to indicate they grew up in the same household. One lame attempt at kid rivalry between Johnny and Ben. And it's so hard to believe that Reed and Ben are best friends (the young kids do a better job at making us believe the mismatched pair are besties).You know it's coming, but the third act fight scene still manages to feel disjointed and unlike the first two acts. Not only does it come across disjointed, the third act is so ham-handed and rushed. The dialogue is stilted, the acting is worse, and some of the fight scenes border on ridiculous. And they never follow up on the redemption that's supposed to bring them all together.But most unforgivable for this reboot are the laughable special effects.The Human Torch effects looked better in 2005 and 2007 (given the technology at the time) that in this movie. And you almost wish they'd just used the bubble from The Wizard of Oz to depict Sue Storm's force field rather than the neon blue mess they decided on. They gave elastic fighting a decent attempt, but it fails.But most awful is the final look they landed on for Dr. Doom. Justno. It's like they ran out of time.One thing this new film does better than the previous two is the special effects for The Thing; definitely a great effort (though, you kind of wish they'd put pants or shorts on him). It's unsettling that he's all Ken-doll down there.Considering how good Ant-Man is, Fantastic Four is a let-down.If you're stuck on an airplane for many hours and have exhausted all the other entertainment options, put this on. It'll keep you mildly occupied for 100 minutes.",Fantastic Four

I mean how do you manage to completely ruin a character like Dr Doom. Also the CGI, how can a movie with the budget they had look so bad. There are no spoilers for this movie because nothing eventful actually happened in the movie. It's exactly as you assume, some people get some powers, 'Dr Doom' comes into the picture and they all have a throw down in the end of the movie and the good guys win.

I was desperate to sell my tickets at half price but my daughter insisted we should see for ourselves how bad it is. So we went in with a negative mindset and 2 buckets of large popcorn to kill the boredom if it existed.To my surprise, it wasn't that bad after all and I wouldn't call it fantastic. It's entertaining enough for a family weekend movie at the cinema.Marvel movies have evolved where not necessary every superhero movie must have great special effects, popular casts, non-stop action etc. Ant-Man is a very welcomed change to Marvel movies with plenty of humor blended into action.Watching Fantastic Four is like watching Stand By Me of the 70s. It's not about awesome fighting scenes or explosive special effects. Just watch it with an open mind and do not give a single thought that this reboot must be better than the original and you will not end up disappointed.Ignore what the critics say as there are no more trustworthy reviews online. As you may have known, if the reviewers are so good at criticizing then why are they not film directors or producers? Why don't they unite their talent and help produce blockbuster movies every month? Even if they think they achieved success with their own production, how would they feel if we were to criticize them and compare their work with the 'Greats'? I believe it's long overdue that IMDb has to change it's User Review policy by only allowing positive reviews to be published. Leave the negative reviews to a sister-site to separate the visitors interest.By doing so using the most popular Movie Review Website, all those who are involved in the production of the movie at least have a consolation to see their effort being appreciated by a certain few.Trust me, Life would be even more 'bored' without them.",Fantastic Four

Watching it is completely different to the trailer. 1. There is no Stan Lee cameo or post credit scene (so if you are going to waste your money on seeing it don't bother waiting through the credits) which is very un-marvel. 2. the movie has very little action for a superhero film. It spends pretty much the whole movie showing the origin. The action only really starts in the last 10 minutes or so. 3. THE THING HAS NO PANTS!!!!!!. 4. The writing and acting is terrible. A special Ed class could write better dialogue. And after watching Whiplash, I though Miles teller was a good actor but this movie changed my mind.

There's no passion in acting, and the story, lord, horrible! As some said, they ever can do a reboot. Some details of the characters and the essence of the comics are completely unrecognizable here. I didn't understood the proposal of the director to change that way the origins of team members. As a fan of comics, this did not pleased me after all. The visual proposal of the movie is quite interesting, but, unfortunately boring and simplistic. There are nothing on the clothes that can be called ""fantastic""; there are no identity on them. Somehow they tried to move away the most of what we'd seen in comics and previous adaptations. On the one hand they were successful in doing so, secondly, they failed miserably in the producing of a good movie.",Fantastic Four
809,dustinnewman,Not as bad as everyone is making it seem,7,7 August 2015,"Everyone seems to be jumping on hate bandwagon so quickly. Yeah, the plot was weak and the character interaction was a bit forced. Yes, the characters themselves were not quite right (Victor Von Doom correcting Reed Richards comes to mind). And some of the CGI effects weren't the best (Sue's force field looks a bit too much like The Incredibles' version, Reed's shape shifting scene, the end battle scene, etc.) However, all that said, I don't think it deserves such a low rating and the epithet of ""trash."" It had an interesting semblance of direction and a unique take on the Fantastic Four beyond the typical bold superheroes angle. The addition of Johnny and Sue's father into the story definitely made the story more interesting to me than the previous movies, where I had never even thought of their father. His character was a good catalyst for the team. Overall, I think that it wasn't the best movie and that it had a lot of unseen potential in its concept stage, but that it's execution and production was a bit lacking. Not enough for its hate following, though.",Fantastic Four

811,markjameswisdom,"Consistently good, if accepted as only the beginning.",8,7 August 2015,"VERY MINOR SPOILER.I am astounded that this movie has been rated so poorly to the point where I felt I needed to create an account to defend it. Firstly, I have not read the comic books so my review will come from experience of the movie alone. If you accept that this film is a complete refreshment of the franchise then you will accept some of the issues that I have noticed previous reviewers seem to have. Honestly, the plot is quite slow paced but that isn't necessarily a bad thing and i personally don't feel it took anything from the film. It introduced a fresh aspect to the comic book movie experience not quite akin to The Dark knight but at a good balance between say that, and the more high octane stuff. With that in mind i think it was at an excellent pace and consistency for such an interesting concept like the fantastic four and the whole ""we need to work together"" idea is really brought through in the movie through the inter-character relationships. Speaking of the characters themselves, it was interesting to see how they were developed and i do not feel like it was rushed. However I see it more as a beginning of something which, as i will explain later, might be the reason why some viewers weren't impressed. Moving on to other aspects, the cinematography was consistently decent and impressive at times, nothing phenomenal but i never found myself thinking something looked unrealistic (apart from a planet of the apes Caesar lookalike).The music score was quite impressive and was worked into the movie well. The costumes are updated and fit well with the slightly more realistic feel which i think the movie pulled off consistently well overall. The film was funny when it needed to be. Enough to remind that it is a comic book story, but nothing to make you howl, as is how it should be.Importantly though, I would like to address one point about chemistry which i feel is being misconstrued by some. One reviewer mentioned that the team felt more like individuals than a team, well, i think that is generally the idea considering towards the climax, the idea that they need to work as a team instead of individually actually begins to kick in. I think it's hogwash to say the actors didn't gel, i jut don't buy it. I think it was intentional to create a rift between them for plot purposes. So for that reason i'm a little confused about where that idea has come from and i think people are forgetting the fact that as an origin installment (which this clearly is) that chemistry, as in real life, needs to be worked on in the beginning, especially considering the characters themselves are all completely different in the first place. With a nerdy Reed Richards, an isolated Sue Storm, a hotheaded Johnny Storm and a tough-as-old boots Ben Grimm, all working together, we must expect difficulties in clear-cut chemistry. And i don't think it is due to a lack of ability on the part of the film makers. Also i can't review the characters and not consider the villain. In this version we can see quite easily the reasons for Doom's downfall to evil, and in fact it is nice to see a character ""gone bad"" that you can actually relate to on some level (To a point of course). And actually, Doom just looks awesome and his powers are phenomenally brutal making him the perfect antithesis of an all-powerful individual to the teamwork aspect of the Four, which was only just touched upon but shown enough to keep me interested. Additionally, i would like to congratulate Toby Kebbel who did a fantastic (Ha!) job and stole more than his fair share of scenes. Just a final point about Michael B. Jordan playing Johnny Storm. As i said i haven't read the comic books so i couldn't care less that the character is supposed to be white. I can see it grating on some so all i will say is that Jordan did perfectly well as The Human Torch and i liked his portrayal.What i will say is that the film has very little actual action but, counter to what others seem to think, it makes up for it with character development and plot even if this is not to an amazingly complex level. This leads me to believe that this film is intended wholeheartedly as an opening to an ongoing franchise, which i would like to see continue,and not a standalone movie by any means. If that is the case then i wouldn't complain about seeing this version of the fantastic four continue and add to the decent beginning we have in this movie. All in all, the film is certainly interesting and worth a watch. Not a chance on Earth does it deserve the 4.1 user rating that it has as i write this review as there are far too many positives. It cannot be taken that low because there are some truly awful movies at that level, and this is not an awful movie, by any means. Did i enjoy the film? Yes. Would i recommend it? Yes.",Fantastic Four
812,kokaistheman,whose fault was this?,3,7 August 2015,"My main question after watching this $230 million film was:whose fault was it? How could i come out of the theater so frustrated?Let me start from the beginning: Coming in with no expectations what-so-ever and even looking past all the basic differences this film had compare to the comic books. I was surprisingly satisfied with the first part - otherwise known as ""the endless intro"". But that didn't bother me. Naaah, not as much as the writing afterward did. Suddenly our heroes got their powers and hundreds of problems where popping up for them making it really hard for me to relate after ""bonding"" with them that much in the first act. It just felt like 20 people had all suck their ideas into the directors face and he lost track of what was important.First major issue, government was a dick. sure they got what they deserved in the end, but destroyed the main characters friendship's to a point of no return, and basically.. made you hate some of them.secondly, the ""one year later""... Why skip the best part of the previous film!?? if you ask me now, all i can remember of the 2005 film is the amazing scene where they learn how to use their abilities, and the famous ""flame on"" that totally died in this film ( i know he said it, but it was just sad.) Also! What was Reed Richards building for a year? sure, we can assume he made a suit for him self and some other quantum machines from what we get to see, but ""poof"" its all irrelevant 2 minutes later, now his best friend Ben is a rock...DRAMA!!...third problem, the rushed ending. i would much rather have the dr doom battle in the second film if that meant having more time for the fantastic four to actually become the fantastic four!. Here's a solution for you!: call it ""origins""or something, sick in a small- time battle and a few more classic ""getting famous"" superhero scenes that we all love and you're done BOOM! that simple. But nooo they had to awkwardly fight their way to ""friendship"" in the last ten minutes of the film...(Sidenote: feels like they still kind of hate each other at the end of the film).And now here are some things i liked! I enjoyed miles teller in this film a lot! especially with his scruffy look, you could see he had done some research on his character, and i would have loved to see more of that. I loooooooved the Dr doom scene! awesome effects! amazing powers! and finally some vengeance on the government dicks!!.Finally I also feel like I cant really hate on the director because i loved his two previous films A LOT.In a tweed this week, defending him self, he said his original version would have been a lot better. Even though some of my problems with the film are quite big to fix with a ""directors cut"". I have to say that I my self, came out of the theater today thinking 'this film has gone through some really obvious ""censorship"", And i do not mean typical censorship, I mean the classic Hollywood tweaks and changes of a directors original vision Censorship.' And that is a shame So i want to believe that it is not his fault, and i am obviously still looking forward to his next film. Which brings me back to the beginning, still wondering.. ""whose fault was it?thanks for reading :) Kay.",Fantastic Four
813,ggroves-19325,Good ideas and fun action but not long enough to flush out fully,8,7 August 2015,This film has learned from the mistakes of its predecessors and made a fantastic four film that is suited to a modern day audience. It has a more gritty tone and takes that from the ultimate comics from which it takes its inspiration from. It is this grittiness that makes this film enjoyable to watch because it makes the dangerous threat actually seem like a game changer whilst actually exploring both the physical and psychological traumas of the power-giving accident.The villain however is one of the downsides to the film. Yes Doctor Doom is the main villain of the ff but they have others which could be transferred brilliantly into film. I'm not saying they didn't do a good job of bring the character to life and i applaud them for actually coming up with a legitimate reason for the suit but his powers are virtually ungrounded through out the film with no limits or actual base work of what they actually are.The second bug bear is the length of the film. At a running time of only 1hr 40mins it isn't long enough to explore the characters and plot lines deeply enough. The relationships between the characters are virtually sidelined in favor of rushing through what could have been great character scenes in favor of cramming in plot points to stick to the tight time schedule. Overall the film has made massive improvements over the cinematic takes that have come before it but there is still room for improvement but none the less i would recommend it to anyone to go and see. 8/10,Fantastic Four
814,wgbessemer,Worst Marvel Movie to date,1,7 August 2015,"It has nothing to do with the Fantastic Four story line. Everything was off none of the characters had anything to do with the character in the comic. Even how they got their powers wasn't close to the comics. There was nothing good about this film and Stan Lee should be embarrassed that he allowed it to be filmed. If I were you please please wait until it comes out and view it on VUDU to rent and save yourself a ton of money. Don't buy it because it is not worth that much. The movie does have some pretty good visual effects but if your a Marvel fan nothing will make you happy about this film. Additionally, all of the characters are young kids unlike the true story lines where they are pretty much established.",Fantastic Four
815,smkt,"Honestly, still mourning the waste of my money and my time.",2,7 August 2015,"This movie was horrible. There is no chemistry between the actors at all, if you don't count some tension over Sue that doesn't go anywhere. The acting is bad and looks forced-the lines are so predictable and hammy that I found myself mouthing along as they say them. There really is no real scientific basis to the 'other dimension'. They don't explain what it is, and why they are so okay with sending people there with barely any research, like if it had oxygen or who knows what else. It's also highly unlikely a child would have been able to build the machine on his own, without help, from spare parts. That's far-fetched, even for Marvel. It also doesn't explain why they'd let Ben Grimm, a normal civilian, into the lab on the basis that he is Reed's friend and is therefore allowed to be there. Victor Von Doom's super-powered look reminds me of a freeze- dried potato wrapped in cellophane that'd been dunked into a vat of Mountain Dew, along with the attitude of a classic 'destroy the earth' super villain with all of the drama and none of the good reasons. The fight lasts barely 8 minutes, and is completely unsatisfying and just plain bad. Can I also mention how disgusting Reed's power is? I don't know why anyone would want to watch his limbs elongate and twitch like an unknown Eldritch horror. It was nasty and I heard girl in the back start retching. Please just rename him the Human Spaghetti. Plus, it has no Stan Lee cameo or any after-credit scenes. I'm only giving this 2 stars because it's a Marvel movie.",Fantastic Four
816,kwesilogic,Fantastic Bore,1,8 August 2015,"Absolutely the worst comic book adaptation I have seen to date! If the filmmaker's who made this, especially the director, actually watched this, I just want to ask them how they felt when they watched?

I feel like it doesn't even deserve a 1 out of 10 it's just that IMDb wont let me put anything lower. It's insane how bad this is, the dialogue, the music , the story are all sub-par.

817,meej-10788,Not a Marvel Movie,3,8 August 2015,"I went to see this a couple of days ago now but am still really disappointed with what I saw. My first real problem with this movie, is that Stan Lee was none existent. I don't know if there was a certain reason or anything but I always watch out for Stan Lee's cameo, in every single Marvel movie I watch. To say I was sad is a understatement.Secondly, the 'battle'. A superhero based movie has to include a battle of some sort. This did. But, the 'Fantastic 4' won the battle with their first attempt? Nope, that's not meant to happen, it was like they didn't even have to put up a fight. Stupid.The 3/10 is for the actors, I thought the acting was good and there were some well known names involved in the film, which I was pleased about.",Fantastic Four

I could easily go into anal detail about how the comic origins are and should be followed or what actors should play roles or how to play roles, script, wanting Oscar type acting etc etc etc, blah, blah, blah. If you go into this movie honestly neutral and open mindedfor what you see in the movie, it is not a bad movie at all! It was good! I only have 3 issues which are fairly minuscule yet important but do not really take away from the enjoyment of the movie. 1. Too much of the movie was about their creation and set-up. The whole movie came out as prelude! At the end of the movie you still think and feel as though there is another 20 to 30 minutes left where they will now engage in enemies now that they just established themselves amongst themselves as the Fantastic 4; run time for the movie is only 1hr 15 min. Hence they had a plethora of room to make this happen; dumb not to have done so! 2. No Stan Lee cameo! What? Why? 3. No after credits spoiler/teaser trailer! What? Why? Wow!!!!! Sad!!!!",Fantastic Four
819,jpeg_artifact,So much potential...,2,8 August 2015,"*Sigh* So in my mind I thought the movie had at least SOME potential to become an enjoyable action- superhero movie like Marvel studios have been rolling out like a factory, BUT NO! this movie SUCKED! If you're a fan, go see it, if you want something to pass time, go count grains of sand, because instead of me being on the edge of my seat and filled with excitement, I sat and waited, and waited, and waited for SOMETHING AT ALL TO HAPPEN!I probably checked my watch fifty+ times, because it's too slow, the proportion of action to plot development is about 1/4!This movie can't even pass time, it just feels like a jumbled mess. The Third Act of the movie was like some mini boss, sad for a villain that is one of the most powerful in the marvel universe. If you've seen trailers or the movie, you've probably seen the Robo-Freddy Kruger thing that they call ""Dr.Doom"", and it just sucks. It looks like they took a third-graders concept art for a super villain, and said 'sure, why not, looks good!'I have no idea where that money went considering the atrocious CG on Mr.Fantastic, the obvious use of teen-aged Caesar for the test ape, the lack of action, and the heroes BARELY showing their powers.*Sigh* So, in conclusion, this film is worthless and I only hope Fox doesn't do this with the next fant4stic , X-men: Apocalypse, and dear god don't do this this with Deadpool.",Fantastic Four
820,simonilett,Another awful teen hero movie,1,9 August 2015,"All I can say is FOX have struck again, with another pointless teen movie about teens with teen problems, I think, because you can't accurately judge character ages in this movie. They do kick off in a high school so you sort of have to assume that no self respecting actor will take acting roles with FOX anymore, and they are horribly exploiting child labor in Hollywood so they can keep churning out this garbage.I'm a huge Marvel fan and have been soaking up everything that Disney & Marvel have been doing with utter admiration, even Ant Man was better than I had originally thought. SO I decided that F4 deserved a chance and maybe, just maybe they had just missed the mark with the trailers for this movie, but...Sadly the trailers tell you everything that is going on, before you have even bothered to hand over your money at the cinema counter and stuff your face with Popcorn. Obviously I'm not going to write spoilers here, but even if I wanted to, I couldn't because there is not a single thing I could take from having watched the full 100 minute movie and expose it here.From the trailer you know the villain, it's Doom, you know the event that causes their super powers, inter dimensional travel plus explosion. And beyond this, you are better off staying at home, because absolutely nothing else happens! F4 honestly spends 100 minutes trying to stitch 5 or 6 characters together who have zero ability to do anything other than overact all their scenes, into a thinly driven story with no arcs that succeeds utterly at failing to have any flair or even remotely interesting set pieces where the main characters could possibly be seen doing anything other than sitting around being mopey about their lot in life.The character relationships from the comics were only ever briefly hinted at, catch phrases OMG don't even start me. This movie was not funny, it was not sad, it was not action packed, it was not smart, it wasn't even dumb. It was just nothing, nothing but a thin attempt at masking profiting off of the Marvel name and the IP that FOX will hopefully one day forget they own.",Fantastic Four
821,fdwleuzzi,Interesting film with terrible storyline,6,9 August 2015,I went in to this film thinking it was going to be terrible due to the awful reviews it was receiving most of these were extremely harsh as it was an entertaining film however it was predictable and some of the actors performances were questionable. However these actors did not seem like a team instead they seemed like a group of kids all wound up in the same situation. Other than that they had no similarity and 75% of the film was focused on there back story's before they actually get there powers. Adding to that victor von doom was only doctor doom for about twenty minutes before he died in the shortest fight in history. 10 minutes before he was splitting people's brains across the walls and then they beat him in all of two minutes. In summary it could of been a good film if it was longer and had more of an interesting fight scene at the end.,Fantastic Four
822,littleangel-05866,"It is not even Fantastic at all, seems like a Science Fair to me",1,9 August 2015,"Warning: contains spoiler indirectly, storyline is unclear, or there is not storyline to be frank, story begins with what a primary school kid who has already realize that things that be transported away to another dimension, a bit ridiculous, and the movie is using too little story from the comic, and there are many questions left in my mind after i have watched the movie, questions like what was reed doing during that one year when his friends were busy ""saving"" the world, doom was left in the other dimension and no one even cares???? Dead or alive???? And then they sent over another team and found him, he should have just shoot everyone to death and open the black hole, why made a fuss in coming back then doom said oh, i wanna go back to that world and destroy earth, this is just dragging the story and wasting my time of watching it, the rock man, Ben was supposed to be better than the first rock man, but he had no pants on, would someone please grab Donald's pants for him? The fight in the story was something like Power Rangers fight for me, it is a movie for kids not adults, i gave rating 1/10 which i think its too high, but actors and actresses did put in effort, i guess they should blame the storyline for making them look so dull in the overall movie.",Fantastic Four
823,mike_stathis,Had some potential,4,9 August 2015,"This movie had potential to be bigger than the rather 'bleak' 2005 version. I wasn't overly impressed with the younger cast but thought maybe they would take a different aspect on the film. I was also keen on how Dr. Doom would be portrayed and how he would influence the film as a villain. I couldn't be more wrong. -There was limited character back-story on the Fan 4 -There was no middle just a five minute climax at the end that was hardly gripping -The cringe-worthy quotes towards the end of the film were just punishing to watch -Dr. Doom looks like a Droid and goes completely insane over a minor issue and the movie doesn't quite explain why - Dr. Doom is also meant to be one of the most O.P characters in the comics but yet he seems to drop down to the levels of the Fan 4 in the final battle which previously you saw him destroy anything in his path previously. -Whats the go with Tim Nelson being in this movie seriously can they stop regurgitating actors from previously failed ' marvel ' movies and maybe have a fresh start for some characters, especially for someone with a mediocre role as he had - Not really a huge issue but very disappointingly no after credits scenes which are signature to marvel based moves ( even though it is owned by FOX ) The only reason I have given it a 3 is the visual effects, only for one character though. The Thing looked insane compared to the 2005 version, only problem was due to the short length of the movie he got limited time and whipped out some really punishing quotes towards the end of the movie. Also I did like Franklin Storm in this film, he was a breathe of fresh air...but again wasn't perfected pulling out some pretty cheesy lines.So overall it was a total dud, no background characterisation on the characters, if there was it was limited and to go along with the short running time, it was hard to watch. Dialogue was just really, really average and I spent a lot of time watching the movie with my hands on my head in agony.",Fantastic Four

I'm not in the industry but you can just immediately see where the studio stepped in (if that's what happened). The editing is absolute trash, the pacing is horrendous. Whoever designed Reeds costume, like c'mon bruh... flimsy springs? There was no repoire or connection with the characters, minus Reed and Ben. It seems like Von Doom was in love with Sue at some point, never explored or explained. Johnny had a huge chip on his shoulder, genius mechanic but doesn't wanna go to a school where he can build to his hearts content? That his dad basically runs? OOOOOK. As a black man, I'm telling you there was no point in changing one of the Storm siblings black and.. SPOILER although who cares.. the other one adopted. This was never explained, it would've taken 1 minute of screen time with Sue... ""My parents were lifelong friends with the Storms, and Johnny's always been like a brother to me. When they died, the Storms took me in."" Done. I just made a simple backstory for the siblings in 8 seconds. Bad CGI, sorry but it's true. Human Torch looked good, especially in close ups. The Thing was good, you could always tell it was CG, but it was good enough, only took you out of the movie when it was a close up of him with a human character. Sue Storm effects were decent, a bit too cartoony. Her powers looked better in the 2005-7 versions. Mr. Fantastics though were HORRENDOUS. Bad CG to the max, didn't even remotely show the versatility in his powers. Dr. Doom was wasted. He showed up on screen, and 12 minutes... literally, about 12 minutes later, the movie ended.. What the s***?? They find him, he goes on this 2 minute murder walk (which was arguably the coolest looking scene in the movie unfortunately), the team comes up with a random plan that basically involves Doom getting uppercutted, and then they win. And the movie is over. GAHHHHHHH I'm so frustrated with this movie I swear. The cast gave it their all, but there's nothing they can do. Fox screwed the pooch hard with this. I just can't believe this is Josh Tranks work, I honestly believe the studio savaged this. You can't go from a great movie like Chronicle to making trash like this. Even a casual movie goer could point out the mistakes in this. The only reason I'm giving this a 4 is because the build up was pretty nice... Actually the movie itself was pretty decent up until legit RIGHT after they got their abilities. Then the movie just went off the deep end. Hard. Like face plant hard.

I simply couldn't. It had good actors under a bad director, insane predictability and ABSOLUTELY ZERO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. The villain, Dr Doom was obviously going to be left in the Earth- 0 and come back and try to destroy the Earth.

827,anthonycanonico,Total Waste of Time going to see this one week early.,2,10 August 2015,"I was presented with the ""fantastic"" opportunity to go see this movie in theatres one week before it officially hit the big screens, a decision I still regret. One of my biggest issues with the movie is the fact that the Fantastic 4 are never really a ""team"", Johnny is only there because he's being punished and the Thing only goes because Reed is drunk and thinks it'd be fun if Ben came with him. Also it seems like the producers shot the scene where they visit the other dimension and then said ""Oops, we forgot about Sue"" and they then make a blast that inexplicably hits her and gives her powers. Also after learning of his powers and what has happened to his friends, Reed (the one who is always cast as the leader) just decides to abandon them all and hide. Now lets move on to Dr. Doom, I don't have much to say that's positive, he looked nothing like he has in previous films or any of the comic books and he looked like an absolute joke of a villain. The one good scene he was involved in was when he walked through killing everybody in his way, but even that had it flaws as he was using powers that were never explained! His powers are never even mentioned throughout the whole film. Also after demonstrating his impressive power he is killed by a single punch in a fight scene that lasts less than 15 minutes, that's right, one of the most iconic villains in history is only hit once, and it is what ends up killing him, on the other hand this is the only time when the ""Fantastic 4"" work together as a team... in the whole movie. During the punch ""The Thing"" uses his iconic line ""Its hammer time"" which I liked in the past but in this edition, he gets the line from his abusive older brother, which just seems off to me. that being said the Thing does look pretty good (I still think he'd look better with pants). In summary doom is defeated in a single blow in a 10 minute fight scenes where a unbonded ""team"" of superheroes get along for one scene in the film.",Fantastic Four

833,andyieley,Entertaining adaption of Ultimate Fantastic Four series,6,11 August 2015,"Despite all the negative reviews, the 3.9 on IMDb and just 9% on Rotten Tomatoes, I still went to see this to be able to see for myself if it really was the disaster everyone says it is. And although it is a flawed film, it really does not deserve the harsh reception it has been given. The fault really lies, not with the film itself, but with a skewered perception by modern day viewers of what a comic book film should be based upon what Marvel Studio themselves have created in the 'MCU'. But first of all, regarding the MCU, lets have a reality check. Fans have become so blinkered into believing that that whatever Marvel Studios touch is going to turn to gold, they cannot see the wood for the trees and will defend their films to the hilt. Iron Man 2. It was clearly a rushed film to promote the up and coming Avengers. There was hardly and plot and the villain was made up, a mish mash of two other villains from the comics. The build to the finale was so very slow and after a truly embarrassing drunken party scene we had a blink and you miss it fight at the end. Iron Man 3. Right, any criticism of Fantastic Four not being true to comics stops here. The Mandarin. Do I need to say anymore? The film is also full of plot holes big enough to drop a space armada through. Killian ""I am the Mandarin"" doesn't get killed by being trapped in the iron man suit and it blowing up, but a small rocket drop kicked to the face by a super powered pepper pots can finish him off? Thor 2. I can't even remember what happened I this film it made that much of an impression on me. Avengers Age of Ultron. A classic case of more is not always better. Age of Ultron bludgeoned the audience with non-stop CGI and endless wise cracks. They ruined a great comic book villain by turning him into the comic relief with zero sense of threat. Hulk Buster can take out the Hulk with one punch to the face? And they killed off a character that should easily be able to dodge bullets by getting shot. Oh, and why was Tony Stark back as iron man exactly? Didn't he quit and destroy all his drones in iron man 3?So you see, not everything Marvel Studios has done is good. Iron Man, Thor, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy are great films. Ant man is good and Incredible Hulk is okay. (Real shame we wont be seeing Tim Blake Nelsons 'The Leader' anytime soon). It also seems the MCU has free reign to mix up some of its own comic book lore. And yet here we are, with people saying this is not 'their' Fantastic Four. Hang on, really? Lets take a look at the synopsis for Marvels own 'The Ultimate Fantastic Four'. I have taken this from Wikipedia.'While the characters may bear resemblance to their normal Marvel Universe counterparts, they differ in many aspects. The origin of their powers is different and the team is much younger. The series revolves around the adventures of Reed Richards, Ben Grimm, and siblings Susan and Johnny Storm, who get engulfed in a malfunctioned teleporter experiment and get superpowers... Reed is a child genius who displayed his curiosity from the day he was born. At the age of 11, following a demonstration of his research on the field of teleportation at a school science fair, Reed was recruited for a government program which sponsors young geniuses' research. He continued his research at the government research facility located in Manhattan's Baxter Building. At the age of 21 his research was realized as he and several others attempted to teleport organic material through an alternate plane of existence called the N-Zone. The experiment went awry giving Reed and several others superpowers.' This is the exact same story in the film! And on Doctor Doom who has been getting a fair amount of criticism, this is what Marvel themselves did to the Character.'Victor Van Damme (yes that's right, Van Damme) was also a member of the youth research project that recruited Reed and Susan, and sees science as an art as opposed to Reed's view of it as a system... Van Damme worked with Richards on his device to teleport organic matter to the N- Zone. ..the experiment resulted in the accident that created the Fantastic Four. Van Damme was also affected by the experiment: Most of his body was transformed into metal, his legs were reshaped into cloven hooves and his internal organs were converted into a toxic substance. So you see, they have simply lifted he story arc from the Ultimate version and they did quite a good job of it too. But it seems fairly clear based on the evidence that film is itself is paced somewhat erratically towards the end, and certainly after director Josh Trank's recent tweet about it not being the film he had a year ago, that the studio did not have the courage to see the creative process through, and caved in to endless fan boy complaints, making changes and ending up with a film doesn't satisfactorily deliver on it original vision. And that's a shame as there is some good stuff here. I liked the build up, the first trip was well done, the first time we see their transformation was intriguing and I actually liked Doom, but he was wasted. I would like to have seen what the original version would have been. I enjoyed watching this more than the MCU films I have already brought to task and hope that FOX have the courage to release a directors cut on BLU-RAY.",Fantastic Four

I mean really, I can sum up this movie in two words,""Fantastic Snore"" because I found myself starting to nod off half way into this movie forcing myself to shove unnecessary amounts popcorn into my face just to stay awake, but at least picking the popcorn kernels out of my teeth kept me amused throughout the second half. The first fantastic four left me feeling like I misplaced a $20.00 bill but this piece of garbage left me feeling like I just got robbed at gunpoint. Thanks a lot Hollywood, just when I think that you have finally hit rock bottom, you come out with something like this. Stop It!",Fantastic Four
835,harrymitch-18493,Cheesy Laughable Remake,2,12 August 2015,"3.9 is generally being to nice.Poor Acting, Poor Plot.Before anything half decent starts to happen it's honestly to late for you to care.My cinema only charges 2.50 for films, and I'm gutted I paid that much, don't bother spending anything money on this film. They should of left the Fantastic Four on the high of the original, now sadly it's being left on a bad note. They honestly had to make a bad film just in introduced them into the ""Avengers"" ( Apparently it's what I read!"" So basically save your money for a decent film and to not watch this cheese balls of a movie!",Fantastic Four
836,irandisky,Fantastic 4 is quite the bombastic venture,2,12 August 2015,"Reboot of original series was too hypedHear that? It's the sound of the third theatrical Fantastic Four film distributed by 20th Century Fox, failing to meet the high expectations created from the trailers. The film performed disastrously, expecting audiences to follow an incoherent narrative involving underdeveloped characters. The 100 minute film apparently required $120 million but the end result says otherwise. Methodical and geeky Reed Richards (Miles Teller), and supportive best friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) presents a prototype teleporter at a science fair, capturing the attention of father-figure Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathy). Professor Storm works for the Baxter Foundation, a government- sponsored research institute. Professor Storm recruits Richards to work with intuitive Sue Storm (Kate Mara) and hot-headed Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan) in order to complete the Quantum Gate designed by troublesome Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell). Though reluctant at first, the four pull it together and soon, facility supervisor Dr. Allen (Tim Blake Nelson) manages to send a group of astronauts to another dimension nicknamed Planet Zero. Richards, Johnny Storm, Grimm and von Doom decide to secretly teleport to Planet Zero with the help of Sue Storm, after blatantly being denied an expedition. Things go haywire when the energy of the terrain is disturbed and an emergency return is initiated. The exposure to the unusual energy of Planet Zero leaves each individual with a unique ability although how they use it is their own decision. After a less than thrilling turn of events, four must unite against one in a battle that's not of the ages. Although the plot may be easy to sum up in a paragraph, a lot of the details the audience needs in order to fully comprehend what's going on are left out. The audience doesn't even know why the young students are so hard at work in a lab until the finished product comes out. That's another problem; up until the creation of the Quantum Gate, the movie is almost stalling, taking too long to explain the back story. Flash forward to the battle scene, and the skills the Fantastic Four demonstrate seem way too advanced compared to 20 minutes earlier. That's because one year has gone by and you can barely tell. Thus the film barely builds any action or suspense and leaves viewers feeling like the whole thing was stuck in its first act. The actors also fail to put on a performance worth witnessing. That's not to say they're bad actors; for one, Teller has been a successful supportive character in recent years during the remake of Footloose and the Divergent series. But as a whole, they fail to develop real on-screen connections to each other, and as a result, the plot doesn't seem to move. The lack of teamwork offsets almost every chance the film has to really reel in the audience emotionally. There are moments where the conversations between the Fantastic Four have potential to liven up the blandness but are then ruined by clichés and other cringe-worthy quotes, such as ""It's clobberin' time"". Aside from Teller as Richards, almost every other actor seems to be miscast. He's the only one that manages to make some scenes tolerable enough despite a horrid script. While quite a box office failure, ""Fantastic Four"" hasn't completely flopped. Some of the special effects seen throughout the film are worth applauding because of their believability. When Johnny Storm becomes the Human Torch, he really becomes the Human Torch. But the best work is seen when a massacre occurs inside a facility where the Fantastic Four are being held. From the gory deaths to the aftermath of the battle, not a penny was spared in order to create these realistic and somewhat unforgettable effects. Matthew Jensen's cinematography also manages to breathe life into a movie that lacks good pacing. The variety of shots used throughout every scene is probably the only thing that makes watching the film easy. Besides that, continuity errors with Teller's facial hair and Mara's hair styles, the pitiful lack of chemistry between the main cast and the extra long back story completely ruins any chance the movie has of being the reboot the series has long-needed.Josh Trank may be a director and screenwriter but it seems like he literally put all he had into his directorial debut, 2012 science fiction film ""Chronicle"". While ""Chronicle"" is a commercial and box office success, ""Fantastic Four"" is being almost universally criticized for its failure to deliver. But in Trank's defense, he stated a year ago that he had a fantastic vision for the film which was subsequently ruined, presumably by Fox. The tweet has since been deleted. ""Fantastic Four"" is riddled with nonsensical dialogue and a muddling mess of a narrative. It's yet another foundering attempt by Fox to make the best out of one of Marvel's greatest group of superheroes. While the movie does have its memorable parts, how its sequel has already been scheduled for release on June 9, 2017, the world may never know.",Fantastic Four
837,miltonheather,Not Fantastic by any means but it doesn't deserve such a bad rap.,6,12 August 2015,Firstly I will admit that when I first heard about the Fantastic Four reboot I was full on against it and already had my mind made up that it would suck. After going to see it however my mind has changed.The overall story arc of the film is good and it progresses nicely but the main problem for me was the length of the film. At only 100 minutes it didn't feel like the characters really had a chance to connect with the audience in as good a way as some of the more recent marvel movies. If the movie was just maybe another twenty minutes longer I think it would have greatly improved how the story was told.Give more emphasis on certain scenes and allow for the tension to build in the audience before we see how the confrontations will play out. With this time constraint the movie felt rather anti-climactic at times and it seemed almost as if everything just blended together as there wasn't any huge emphasis on certain points.I did enjoy the film and while it wasn't as great as the 2004 version of the film I am looking forward to a sequel and how fox plans to improve upon this not so great showing. As a fan of the first two fantastic films I am interested on how the relationship between them all will change in their new environment and how they plan on facing the Sue and Reed relationship that was so prominent in the first two. Overall it was a good story but I think the short length really hurt it and made it somewhat boring at times.,Fantastic Four
838,joshmcleod-19914,The worst superhero film in living memory,2,13 August 2015,"Fantastic Four is, by a considerable distance, the worst film I have seen this year. My hopes were not particularly high beforehand, whispers of a nervous studio and on-set disputes gave the impression that this was going to be another mediocre superhero reboot that came too soon. Those expectations of mediocrity however, for all the wrong reasons, were greatly exceeded. At best this film was chronically boring, at worst it was straight up laughable. Throughout the film I was in a state of disbelief, disbelief at how unconvincing and cringeworthy the dialogue was between Miles Teller and the rest of the cast. One of the things I really enjoyed about the 2005 film was the whimsical relationship between Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis, who played The Human Torch and The Thing respectively. Any humour of this kind was completely lost on the current crop unfortunately. To be fair to them, their task was helped in no part by a plot that was rushed and lacked any sort of coherence. This was rounded off by one of the worst thought-out finales imaginable. It was as if the writers had forgotten they had a movie script to write, and hurriedly scribbled it down on the back of an envelope 10 minutes before their deadline. It got to that peculiar situation where it is so bad it starts to become amusing - similar to the Sharknado franchise. All in all, if you like wasting your time watching atrocious movies, Fantastic Four is for you. If not, best to give this one a swerve. Will be interesting to see if the sequels go ahead, I would be surprised.",Fantastic Four
839,nyssau,Watching a hamster run on a wheel would be more entertaining than this movie.,1,14 August 2015,"I'm giving this movie a 1, I'm so far disappointed in this film that I wanted to walk out and demand my money back, but I stayed and watched and made my eyes bleed in order to hold out hope that it might change for the better. Spoiler: It didn't.I understand that movies nowadays would like to stray away from using animals, especially in scenes that make it look like they've been harmed in some way (or have the potential to be), and I'm all for that. But if you're going to use CGI instead of an animal how about making it actually look real instead of making it look massively computerized, I also realize that graphics are hard and take time and effort, but if you want to say that this movie is made from the same studio as X-men, why don't you make the effort to explain that amateurs actually rented out the studio and created the graphics using technology found in the 1980's. An entirely different movie would have been a better choice, than trying to (poorly) redo a movie that complete failed from the start. It completely fell flat and disgraced the name of the Fantastic 4, and honestly it made Marvel studios look like a complete joke. I understand that movie making is hard and requires a lot of time and effort, and I think that they tried, but it was so far from their best it's not even comical. This is not a movie that I look back and think ""It was so stupid it was funny,"" no; this is a movie that makes me regret wasting two hours of my life sitting down and hoping that their was some just God in the world that could save this movie and actually make it interesting. Thinking about it... I will give it two stars... the saving grace of the movie was actually the first 20 minutes of the movie describing Reed and Ben's relationship and how they ended up making their transporter machine. But other than that the movie spent more time describing how the machine was made than actually getting to the meat of the issue. And the fact that Doom was completely forgotten about until the last 10 minutes makes me think that they were going along minding their own business finishing filming and then one intern runs on set saying ""WAIT! WE FORGOT ABOUT VICTOR VAN DOOM!"" and since it's the last day of filming they have to quickly patch him in and say ""oh yeah, that's right, well here is a short fight scene to make up for lost time, but you die, sorry for forgetting about you, I'll have flowers sent to your door.I hope you have something better coming Marvel, because if this movie is any indication... I'd say fire the writer and move forward and try to bury this one where no one will try to find it; maybe that useless dimension you guys thought was a ""brilliant"" idea.",Fantastic Four
840,sskev,Not great but not as bad as people say,6,15 August 2015,Fantastic four is an origin film leading to the creation of the team and that's what it should be treated like. If you are a fan of origin films and love the fantastic four this film is for you if not this film will not pander to your tastes.The main problems with this film is that it follows Reed Richards perspective on things and does not unfortunately follow the rest of the fantastic four that much. Also it is one of those films where is just feels like it has a beginning and an end (no middle) and the end is very rushed. I thought the origin story was a nice new take on the franchise and introduced new elements to keep the story fresh. I do not understand why people are comparing this to movies like Ghost rider spirit of vengeance as it is definitely not hat bad. I say give it a go if you are into these genre of films you might be surprised.,Fantastic Four
841,achebe-44544,"Not BAD, but AIGHT",7,15 August 2015,"I love the Fantastic Four series Let's put it this way: if the first one was a 9-10/10, the second one was 4-5/10 and this third one was better 7-8/10.This movie was trying to establish some background and it filled some holes in the first one. Anyways, the only critical review is that there were some scenes that they spent too little time and others they rushed. For instance, they should have spent some times on individualized character development. This movie display the team's development. But I can understand why their struggle. On the other hand, they did not want to pack it with unnecessary action scenes like some action movies have. Although, my sister would have preferred more action scenes. Otherwise, they cut straight to the point and did not have any of those fillers.The first movie still is the best with great balance of substantial story and action. Bottom line: the movie isn't as bad as many bandwagoners say. It's definitely better than 1/5 and 3/10.",Fantastic Four

These are all movies that were better than this movie. I've only ever walked out of a movie and gotten my money back three times and this was the third. This is however the quickest I've ever walked out of a movie. So far as I can tell I just watched a trailer trying to be passed off of a movie. What would have been so much better would have been the original cast in Fantastic 4: 3. Please heed my words and do not waste your money on this crap! Take the money you would have spent on this and buy yourself something nice. A couple of beers, a DVD, CD, maybe even a couple of comic books. If you really need you Fantastic 4 fix get some F4 comics. It is also a bunch of crap what they are doing to marvel. Give the rights back already.

843,laurafromhastings,Not a film I'd watch again.,4,18 August 2015,"I'm always one to go and view films that I don't think I will particularly like but this one was one of my least favourites. First of all, I feel the film was too short. I rarely say that about films but this one could have quite easily gotten away with a further 30-40 minutes when they could have actually allowed more time focusing on the characters after they had been to the other world. They could have focused more on how the characters would have felt with the abnormalities they now had. Secondly, Doom, when he was actually the villain, featured very little in the plot which I feel could have bee incorporated more into the plot. There was no real threat as he defeated within minutes which wasn't quite what I expected to happen. You barely got to know Doom, even before he got trapped on the other planet which could have been included more in the plot. All you see of him is that he gets a bit jealous and has a thing for Susan.It isn't a film I'd watch again but it did have many good elements to it as well.",Fantastic Four

845,taelanjr,Grr... They could have made it better!,5,21 August 2015,"So I went to this movie a couple weeks after it was released. Before I looked at the reviews, I thought this movie would actually do good, and it would've been better than the first 2 Fantastic Four movies. I was wrong.In my opinion, the problem with this movie is they spend way too much time on developing the characters. This movie is 100 minutes long and for about 92 minutes of it, it was getting ready for this ""big"" fight. Instead, you get around 8 minutes of Dr. Doom throwing rocks at people.I will admit, some parts in the storyline were interesting, but it wasn't near enough to block out all the boredom. What I did like about the Fantastic Four movies made in 2005 and 2007, is that they actually felt like a TEAM. Which I'm pretty sure is a major part in the Fantastic Four universe. I didn't really feel a connection to them in the movie.I left the theater disappointed, they just made some really BIG and stupid mistakes and decisions that dragged the movie down a lot.

I think it at least deserves a 7/10 rating. The graphics were AMAZING, (THIS MIGHT BE A SPOILER FOR SOME OF YOU) especially when the fantastic four discovered the other dimension. (YOU CAN CONTINUE READING ON FROM HERE)- The sound quality was also not bad. I really liked the movie and this deserves a better rating. What is so bad about this movie? I still don't understand why the most powerful character wanted to destroy the world and be the only person on the planet (I don't remember his name, he was the character who fell off the cliff into the energetic green liquid in the other dimension). I liked how they chose Area 51 as a place to analyze these (lets call them superheros)",Fantastic Four

He basically used the name of a comic I love to get me to see it and then gave me a different movie. The casting was awful (none of the characters matched their comic counter part. They were all too young so of course Reed Richards didn't have gray streaks, who thought it would be a good idea to make a tiny guy the Thing?, and was it really necessary to make the Storm family have a ""modern home""? That's more of a story that would fit in the X-Men), the origins dragged on for too long, and their origin wasn't even the same!

It starts off a mess and ends even messier. We have the typical ""origin"" story where two of the friends are in grade school and create a science project type experiment pretty much for kicks. They make a teleporting device out of spare game and car parts. Yes, that is true. Skip some years, Ben Grimm is forgotten, people do stupid crap that has little to do with the story.

It is by no means a great movie. However, I firmly believe that this isn't a bad movie and that people are being WAY too harsh toward it. I understand the criticisms that the film felt rushed and had little to no action in it, but people seem to be ignoring the good things that the film did. For one, I thought the four main actors did a great job with their roles and were completely believable as their characters, especially Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, who completely owned his character. I thought that the character of Doom could have been developed more and had more screen time, but I thought he was cool whenever he was on screen.While the action was lacking at times, Doom's escape from the facility looked great and was one of the highlights of the film. Also, I don't understand people's criticisms of the effects looking fake. I thought they looked cool, but that's just me. I also actually liked this origin story a lot more than the original (sue me). It was more grounded and had a bigger sense of suspense. Plus, there was a legitimate friendship between the four main characters.I won't get into the flaws of this film, because I think everyone knows what they are. Overall, this movie isn't perfect but was a lot of fun to watch. I'd recommend that people ignore the critics on this one and go check it out.",Fantastic Four

Okay, before everyone has a heart attack, this movie does indeed have major problems but for I what I thought I was going to get, I was pleasantly surprised how much I took away from this. The best aspect of the Fantastic Four is it's cast, everyone was the best choice for their role, especially Miles Teller.There where a lot of complaints of the movie being dull and boring, but to be honest, I was really invested in the storyline and I wanted to know what was going to happen next and see the characters come out okay. Unfortunately the climax was a let down, incredibly rushed, and Doom, talk about a missed opportunity. I actually liked where Victor began, this angry young man who in his own way wants to improve the situation on earth. As soon as he reappeared as Dr. Doom, he became such a generic bad guy. Also, while I liked Jamie Bell, overall he had very little to do both as Ben Grimm and The Thing, which is a shame.I am one of those people who want to see Marvel Studios get all their character back, I want to see Dr. Doom fight the Avengers, I want to see the Silver Surfer and Galactus realized to their full potential, sadly it looks like the rights won't be going back to Marvel anytime soon. For a movie that was only made so the rights wouldn't revert back, I quite enjoyed the film and I'm not ashamed to say it.

A lack-luster ""Super-Hero"" movie. There are several factors as to why this film IS so bad. Firstly, you can say they were trying to diverge from the original story to create something different, something new. Secondly, the film needed to be longer. There needed to be more back story, more character, more chemistry. And lastly, the set up of the film was wrong. The whole cast and crew needs re-shuffling. Now that is nothing personal against the actors, because each of the four leads have all been brilliant in other films... Just not together in this one. Now that can be blamed on the rush in production with no real time to connect and through poor direction. This film could have been great under the same premise, but it was not meant to be. This now makes me appreciate the old Fantastic Four movies. I blame 20th Century Fox for this one, purely trying to keep rights to make more money.

861,elversondeli,Previews Didn't even get my attention,2,16 September 2015,"Recent remakes (Superman and This one )are steering away from the comic book feel and visual look that everyone expects. The most recent spider man, superman and fantastic 4 remakes were all awful visually!!! Totally wrong casting for every roll of these films! We expect the men to be outrageously muscled out and the women perfect in figure and looks. The 3 mentioned had none and the blue dark colors in every frame of the films made it too dark visually and boring to look at. Even if the script was good, visually it was horrible. Costumes! YIKES! You put armor on super heroes!? Credibility gone with them being a super hero. All the critics are criticizing the script....it's not the script, it is the visual...bring back the color and the look of the comic book and how they look in the comic book. Don't reinvent something that already works visually, just give us a good story to go along with that superhero.",Fantastic Four

I don't know why this movies starts from Level 0.. We all knew that who is the Fantastic Four. This movies shown that how they became fantastic four. It should be Part one of Fantastic Four Series.. Directors or makers were too late.. I was waiting for this movie from long time.. Story is very weak and story hasn't base. And Climax of this movie is just like a slap of my face....When a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.Fantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies.",Fantastic Four

Especially when the back story doesn't match the original comic book start up in any shape or form, they should have stuck with the original movie and made a sequel before Captain America was made, what an epic fail.",Fantastic Four
864,marcusf-82564,Not as bad as I thought it would be.,5,27 September 2015,"I went for this movie with very low expectations, I had heard a ton of bad reviews and it wasn't exactly a film I was looking forward to especially since this was the fourth attempt and the previous movies weren't exactly good. However, when I did watch this film it fortunately wasn't too bad (that doesn't mean it was great). One good thing about this Fantastic four was that it tried to focus more on the characters' back story before they got their powers, but the movie got carried away with that and we didn't get to see enough of the Fantastic Four with their powers. The cast also wasn't bad, but Jamie Bell as the Thing? This movie also had a darker tone as compared to the previous Fantastic Fours but like I said the movie got carried away and it felt too dark. There really wasn't anything emotional in the movie either, no-one you could really feel for or sympathize with.The movie also felt clichéd at some parts, especially Doom who wasn't really convincing as a villain and his funny green mask didn't help. The climax was really short and although it had some good parts ('it's clobbering time') it felt very predictable and cartoon like. Overall I think this movie had potential and some good ideas but they didn't nail it, the movie should have and could have been so much better, it was a good attempt though and it could maybe have a good sequel that is if there are any plans of a sequel.",Fantastic Four
865,sarfrajturup,"Not a great movie by any means, still doesn't deserve the thrashing it received.",6,25 September 2015,"It had been given to understand by almost everyone in Movie news business that things looked bleak for the movie fantastic four even before its release. All with the problems during production, alleged re- shoots and rumors of most of the last act being handled/looked after/meddled with by someone other than the original director Josh Trank. It kinda felt like everyone, critics especially, were just waiting to pounce on it as soon as it came out. I mean it has crawled up to a rating of 4.1 on IMDb. It deserves a tad better.***Spoilers 4head***Now, Josh Trank had a vision for how to bring these characters to life on the big screen, and in the first half of the movie you can see how he wanted to tell this story. And had he been given full liberty, we might have actually got to see a welcome change to the way super heroes are portrayed on film these days. Not to say i don't like the Marvel way. I love their movies and keep looking forward to them. But its not necessary that every superhero movie has to follow the same formula.Coming back to F4, it starts promisingly by taking a look at Reed and Ben in their young days, showing Reed's passion for science. Taking due time to introduce the members of the titular team one by one, and the antagonist Victor Doom played by Toby Kebbel, who does a decent job until he transforms into Dr. Doom and his face is masked. The movie builds nicely till two thirds of the way in, giving emphasis on how the team comes together, and then bam!! It just loses it completely from there on. You can almost hear Studio bosses shouting "" We want more action!! And we want it fast!"". So the hard work done in the first two acts is completely undone by some extremely bad screenplay, incompetent direction, forced action and plain mediocre effects. Its almost like a different team worked on the first two acts and a different on the last act.It never felt that there was anything at stake other than the usually ambitious and cliché plans of the military to use the 'conditions' of our heroes for ""greater good"". Like making more destructive weaponry of course. And oh yes, we lost a few cars to the other dimension. Thats it. I would have rather liked Dr. Doom to cause some havoc on planet earth so that our heroes can stop him with us puny earthlings watching, instilling faith in us and gaining popularity. They ARE planning a sequel, right? I am not sure people of earth in the movie even know who the fantastic four are when the credits roll.The films skimpy duration of 90 odd minutes is a big problem for me. Having Mr. Fantastic desert the team for searching a cure didn't help anything at all. I think another 20-25 minutes would have really really helped the films cause. Instead of jumping a year later after our heroes get their powers, they could have shown them getting used to their newfound abilities, harnessing them, maybe a rescue act or something showcasing their powers, some camaraderie between the team, which the first film made by Tim Story did beautifully, way before The Avengers.Also nothing is shown of Ben Grimm's family after his transformation. What happened to them, how do they react. How Ben learned to deal with his permanent transformation, since the other team members physical forms were not altered permanently. The effects with the human torch were pretty good and the CGI Thing looked awesomely bad ass. Also it was amusing to see Reed in one scene using his elasticity to change his looks. But there is nothing much to write home about when it comes to the overall effects and story. The effects in the final and incidentally the only action seen in the movie are practically cringe worthy. Who approved Dr.Doom's look after his transformation? Horrible. Also its never explained how he managed to survive so long on a planet in a seemingly another dimension with such a hostile environment.I thought Jamie Bell as the Thing and Michael Jordan as Human Torch did a good job in their roles. I still love Chris Evans as The Torch more though. Miles Teller, though he was OK, failed to make a major impression as the Leading man of the team. Kate Mara was all right but again nothing to sing praises of. Reg Cathey was solid but isn't given much to do. Tim Blake Nelson as maybe the head of the facility just can not wipe that irritatingly evil grin off his face throughout the entire film. I mean he does that even while having a normal conversation! Just bad.Overall, i think the movie had potential, an interesting first half, only to be squandered by the practical output of what happened behind the camera that only Trank and Studio execs could shed light on. A sequel with someone who knows how to make superhero movies and has the trust of the studio in his own vision, i think this team has the potential to click.My rating - 6 stars out of 10",Fantastic Four
866,fabionj,Disappointing,3,21 September 2015,"Just finished watching the Newest Version of the Fantastic 4. One of the worst comic book adaptations! Was it made by Nickelodeon? It Had absolutely nothing to do with the story line and The cast was all wrong! The acting and special affects were of good quality but the cast and characters in no way resembled the characters created by Marvel. What was wrong with the previous versions? The cast was perfect. I read some reviews stating the filmmakers felt they needed to revamp and save the franchise. Well, they got it all wrong If your going to completely re-write it, then it's NOT the Fantastic Four! come up with your own ideas and stop screwing up Marvel. Stan lee what hell were you thinking letting them do this??!! I understand taking some artistic liberties and tweaking a story to update it or make it more interesting but all they did was create four characters give them the same names marvel used along with the same attributes (Powers) and slap the Name Fantastic Four on the title. There is Nothing of the Marvel fantastic Four story line in this at all! very disappointing!",Fantastic Four
867,etexrealtyus,Awful !!!!!!,1,27 September 2015,"1) Story: The movie didn't follow the comic book. It was awful. The characters didn't become the fantastic four, until most of the movie was over. At the beginning ,Reed was near the age of 11 when he created a dimensional portal. There is no way a child at 11 could create that. He'd have to learn way too much. (And even worse: It was made from salvaged trash.) 2) The characters were jacked: The Reed from the 2005 movie looked way more like Reed from the comic book. On the new movie, he didn't even get the gray hair on the sides. Dr Doom's outfit was horrible. His hood looked like a tied green blanket or something. And most importantly, Where did he get it from? He was in another dimension. He wasn't supposed to be some crazy hermit, he's the ruler of a country. And.... everybody was a genius. Johnny Storm is not some genius, he's the obnoxious one. (His special effects were also awful.) Also, Susan was the assistant, not another genius. 3) The effects were awful. The human torch in the 2005 movie makes you want to actually be him, but in the new movie, it makes you think "" that's awful."" It looked like a cartoon was pasted onto the movie. THE thing looked like a rocky hulk. He's not supposed to be that big.I'll never get those hours back...",Fantastic Four

A friend of mine saw the film and had shared his dismay when he had been forced to see this with some family members. ""Horrifying,"" he had called it. Anyways, I thought that it couldn't be THAT bad, seeing that I thought the widely-panned Terminator: Genisys was pretty good, and there was a talented cast. Man, was I wrong. There was NO story whatsoever, it was RIDDLED with huge plot holes, the CGI looked as if it had been finalized by a toddler, and it was completely rushed in its around 90 minute run time. They become the Fantastic Four in the last HALF HOUR! The villain arrives (garbage costume and all) in the last FIFTEEN! This film has no right to wear the Marvel brand. ""From the studio that brought you X-Men Days of Future Past""? Poor X-Men! I walked out feeling exhausted because I had forced myself to watch this trash with bad directing. I genuinely felt bad for the talented cast after seeing their talent in much better films (Miles Teller in Whiplash, Kate Mara in The Martian, Michael B. Jordan in Creed) that they had to star in this humiliating feature. I would rather watch The Avengers again, thanks.",Fantastic Four

As the previous ""Fantastic Four"" movies were awesome, I had high expectations from this movie. Technology in 2015 has developed much more than it was in 2005.

EVERYTHING changes and evolves...n frankly im sick of watching a movie u really....don't have to watch because its predictable n redundant. This movie is great... the story line is good the concept and how it evolved was just enough for you to expect a sequel...this movie set the STAGE for more to come. MY ONLY COMPLAINT.. is not with the cast itself but the writing of the roles are a lil disconnected but may be due to more evolving later in sequels. THE MOVIE Isn't A REMAKE OF MORE OF THE SAME..but a fesh new approach to a newer feel and vibe..if u go into it looking to judge it by what it IS, u will love it..if u went to the movies to pick it apart for what its NOT..Then u really missed out on enjoying a good film.",Fantastic Four

If they made me laugh, I want to laugh! If they made me cry,I want to cry! And if they made me angry, then I want to be ANGRY!

It is marketed to the action movie audience, but the few who were lucky enough to watch it were in for a huge treat. They were witness to one of the greatest satirical comedies of this century!

876,ReeceBridger,Not-So-Fantastic Four (Not A Movie Review),1,2 November 2015,"I'm not even gonna write a review about this one; while we all thought this was going to fill in the gigantic holes that the 2005 movie and its sequel had, it did do that at certain points. But in doing so, it forgot to do what the older movies did right.Don't get me wrong. The new one had some interesting ideas and, let's face it, this new Thing actually looks like the Thing. The 2005 Thing looked exactly like Michael Chiklis only made out of stone, beer gut and all, so that's a point for the new film in that the Thing actually looks like the Thing - a fact that I cannot stress enough. The new cast of breakout stars did an excellent job and honestly having Sue be the adopted Storm child worked really well when you see the conflict between her and Johnny - which you'll miss if you blink, because it happens like three times for about one line each way. The way these characters got their powers and the immediate aftermath of the government trying to militarise them is unique and original, even if about 60% of the movie takes place at some bullshit location called Area 57. Seriously, did the 1 on their door sign just get tilted to one side or something? And, of course, Sue Storm is not a genius whose genius is only mentioned once with a super-suit with its zipper drawn down so it conveniently shows 75% of Jessica Alba's cleavage. She is just a genius... and not much else.The characters stayed true to their comic counterparts as far as the 'Personality' section on any basic GaiaOnline role-player's character profile could fill them. Reed's a nerd with a survival instinct that borders on cowardice; Johnny's a hothead who ain't gonna listen to no one telling him what to do ('Mmhmm' *rolls head and snaps fingers*); Sue's a brainy little sister figure who once again makes it clear that nerdy girls can still be hot as long as they say nothing courageous and do nothing to display their intelligence except when no other options are left; and Ben is an muscle-struck idiot with a misplaced grudge, who forgets his misplaced grudge immediately after Reed stops being a coward for about twenty minutes. The Doom character in this movie was interesting and on-par with the Julian McMahon version... in the sense that what sucked about the old one was good about the new one and vice versa. With this Doom character, I was impressed by how he became Doom as a result of not only his spacesuit fusing to his skin but also becoming one with the energy system in the Negative Zone. That's another thing, too. One sec, lemme just... get my megaphone... Ahem.IT IS CALLED THE NEGATIVE ZONE! NOT PLANET ZERO! THAT IS BASIC FANTASTIC FOUR LORE! YOU ----ED THAT BIT UP, TRANK!Ahem... Honestly, if you thought Fox couldn't do worse than they did with the 2005 version... Well, that's why it's 'third time's the charm', not second. I've already talked about the poor characterisation, the lack of really noticeable conflict between the characters, and the disappearance of any depth in these characters beyond face value. There's also the fact that the origin story takes up the entire story, leaving no room for the Fantastic Four to even be the Fantastic Four until right at the end. It says a lot that the only time the words 'Fantastic Four' appeared in the movie was in the title screen. Honestly, you know a movie about people with superpowers is going to blow when more of the special effects budget is spent on the things that led to them getting superpowers rather than on them using their superpowers.Really, by the end of it, when the credits started rolling, I was waiting for five things to show up: 1. The Fantastic Four actually being the Fantastic Four together for more than the three minutes it took for them to band together and kick the crap out of Doom. 2. A post-credits scene. 3. A Stan Lee cameo. 4. Ben Grimm to actually have a point going into the quantum gate when they get their powers, other than the way a children's author might bring their dog to a book signing because it inspired the main character and stamp their paw prints in stamp ink inside the covers. 5. The other half of the movie that the studio clearly forgot to put in. And none of them showed up. Maybe something similar happened to the test audience, or the writers, or generally anyone who was supposed to make sure this movie was good.Long story short, Fox took another stab at Marvel's first family and blew it even worse than the first time. Now I'm starting to think that it's not a coincidence that our tickets didn't read 'Fantastic Four' but just 'F'. As in, the grade I am giving this movie.Oh, look. I guess I did write a review after all.Still, look at the bright side. At least this royal screw-up might be what gets Fox to give the rights to the Fantastic Four back to Marvel Studios.",Fantastic Four

I enjoyed it way more than all the spider-man films, the avengers films, the previous fantastic 4 films and the 2nd and 3rd Iron man movies (loved the 1st iron man - this film is on par with that).If you like action movies with lots of special effects then this is for you.If you're a purest comic book fan with no space in your tiny little mind for an evolution of ideas then you probably already gave this a totally undeserved scathing review.Watch it and make up your own minds people :)",Fantastic Four

I hope they don't rush to make a sequel for this movie yet, they need to look for a good director that have a same vision with the studio, so that there will be no friction like this movie did.

Poor dialogue, unbelievable relationships, rushed and ruined. With a palette of awesome special effects and quite clearly a huge budget this could have been a cracking movie. For me this is a wasted opportunity. Did the Director and Production team actually watch this before release? If so how are they actually taken seriously within their profession?

You see little to no action with in the first hour of the movie! These movies are supposed to be action-packed! I'm assuming the intentions were to have this as a set up movie to future ones but in all honestly it's still did not contain enough action. I could see a little bit of darkness in this movie which I did like but not in a way to be inappropriate for most older children. I just think children would be bored. With a summer of action-packed movies this one just could not hold up.Maybe it's just me but to be honest I think they are releasing too many movies too quickly.

885,FelipeDziedzic,The Fantastic Four Times Worse Than I Imagined,3,11 August 2016,"Okay, we all know this one kind of flopped. Big time. The world has a hatred relationship with Fox, and with good reasons. By the way, I'm one for ""Bring Fantastic 4 back to Marvel"", because it just hurts us fans to see people do this do such loved heroes.The thing is, the first hour of the movie is good. I really enjoyed it, very sci-fi(ish) and really building up for a great finale. But that is the first act. The whole introduction and telling of the accident took more than an hour, in other words: way more than a third of the movie. My favorite part of all introductionary super- hero movies is where they discover their powers, harness their strenghts and become a better hero.It lasts about three minutes in this movie.So we go for the great finale, we are introduced to Fox's second version of one of the most beloved and most powerful Marvel villains: Doctor Doom. Guess what, he only appears for about ten minutes, and he sucks. That's right, his motivations are all ridiculous, he's unwilling to cooperate since the beginning of the movie and his jealousy over Sue makes me want to stop watching the movie at minute 30.Another thing that ruins the third part of the movie is the CG, I don't know why, but when the plot goes kapoof, so does the money for CG rendering. Some scenes are worse than PS2 graphics, and that isn't even an exaggeration. One in particular, where Johnny Storm first lands in the airport-thingy, after taking down the drones. In that moment, the ambient looks like someone didn't pay the designer and he was mad about it. Indie movies with no budget do CG better.Don't even get me started on Von Doom. His appearance was so bad, I can't even describe it. I wonder how many people looked at it and sad it was good enough to go to the movies. I personally blame all of them for this. He looked TERRIBLE. What was that? I thought they got it right in the old movie, the shiny metal and green cape stuff. This one looked like a un-rendered version of a creature out of Aftershock 2 (that old PC game).In the end, I'm actually willing to give Fox a second chance. I know that it isn't happening, but I would watch a Fantastic Four 2 again. That's because I really liked the group, the actors and the sci-fi vibe to it. I hoped companies gave the directors more freedom, Josh Trank said on twitter that the movie we saw wasn't his. It is too bad to see big companies ruin what could have been good.The result is, the movie was ruined on it's last thirty minutes, by not presenting a second act nor a decent third act. We got no learning out of it and the whole bad-CG and blue-ray-of-death-thingy doesn't cut it anymore. So, as a big fan, give this back to Disney. They deserve it. You ruined my favorite group of heroes, twice. Good job, Fox. You put the brilliant kid from Whiplash, the great actor from Creed, the talented Kate Mara from Interestellar together and you managed to make me not connect with any of them. I couldn't even have empathy for the guy covered in rocks, and even the last movie could make me. It began with a solid eight and it went downhill right at the best part. Too bad they ruined another one, I really hoped it was good.",Fantastic Four

There was hardly any action and the actors chosen for the film did not fit their roles well at all. I wish someone will save this franchise like they did Spider-Man because I feel the fantastic four has a lot of potential in the current marvel era.",Fantastic Four
887,bmsjlu,They look like bunch of pony's.,1,14 May 2016,"Seriously, what was the casting director thinking? Cast look like bunch of teens going for a teen adventure. The only teen that people like in MCU is Spiderman. Besides, they were suppose to be mid-aged scientist right? Just to cast some pony's so that they can be there in the long run doesn't make any sense. Think about casting some awesome mid-aged actors like Channing Tatum or Zack Efron. For god sake they could have cast some well know middle aged super stars too. Instead, they choose some baby-face actors. This cast sucks more then the movie. An advice to the film makers is to cast some good actors that people wanna see willingly (not forced) in the next sequel.",Fantastic Four
888,abasu-93804,"A ""Fantastic"" Chore to Watch",2,16 May 2016,"Twentieth Century Fox has managed to create yet another fantastic fail with the newest remake of ""Fantastic Four"". Movie-goers expecting the usual energetic, action-packed, captivating Marvel adventure should reconsider their decision to purchase a ticket. This movie, originally aiming to be an intrepid take on the story, has unfortunately become an embarrassing addition to the Marvel family complete with a lack of action, an incoherent plot, undeveloped characters, and cliché dialogue.The story involves Reed Richards, a brilliant young scientist, who teams up with three other intellectuals, Susan Storm, Johnny Storm, and Victor von Doom, to create a portal to an alternate universe, Planet Zero. In an unplanned trip through the portal, three of the scientists as well as Reed's friend, Ben Grimm, gain superhuman powers from a mysterious substance that permanently alter their physical form. While teleporting back to Earth, the group loses Victor on the other side of the portal, and when Victor is rescued, his feelings towards Earth have changed, for the worse. The Fantastic Four (Reed, Sue, Johnny, and Ben) must band together and harness their superpowers to stop Doctor Doom from destroying the Earth.This plot had the potential to be as engaging as all the other Marvel films until ""Fantastic Four"" writer-director Josh Trank decided to compress the action scenes into the last ten minutes of the movie. During the only battle scene, Victor wants to kill everybody; the individual members could not stop Victor until they decided to work together; the team pulls through. How original. In the end, bringing Victor's downfall seemed less challenging than watching the entirety of the movie. Presented with the option to choose any of the thrilling Fantastic Four adventures in the comics, Trank chose to make a movie with an hour and a half of exposition and a misshapen thing that Trank believes is an ending.The movie also features so many plot holes that I was surprised not to view Adam Sandler in the cast list. After the disjointed exposition, the male members of the team resolve to travel to the alternate universe while intoxicated since the multi-million dollar teleporter is conveniently left unsupervised in a vacant building at night. Unfortunately, Susan Storm, the only female scientist involved in the project, is left out of the adventure, instead ditched for Ben who was not even part of the project and apparently has no problem traveling to other planets at midnight with no short notice. Even more disappointing is that after the scientists had invested millions of dollars and worked on the project for more than half of the movie, the whole contamination ordeal occurred only because the inter-dimensional teleporter was made with single pane glass, and it broke (unexpectedly).The most appalling plot hole appeared, however, once the One- Year-Later title card flashed onto the screen. Why does Susan Storm have powers even though she never touches the green substance on Planet Zero? What happens to Reed after he decided to run from the facility where he was imprisoned after returning to Earth? How do the rest of main characters adjust to their superpowers and face the challenges presented with mastering their powers? Apparently, Trank never wants the audience to know.It is unfortunate when the Wikipedia page offers more substantial character information than the actual movie does. Within the long, winding exposition, the relationships between characters are developed awkwardly so that one scene the characters are introduced, and not even five minutes later, they are the closest of friends. Additionally, most of Victor von Doom's character history and relationships can be described in one word, vague. Doctor Doom vaguely has feelings for Susan Storm. Unlike the diabolical Doctor Doom in the comic series, this Doom only has a vague hatred of the government. Doctor Doom has a vague reason to destroy the Earth and kill everyone in the climax. By not providing any background on the character and disregarding the comic, Trank manages to create one long, unexplained mystery of a film, understandably displeasing both Marvel and non-Marvel fans alike.The movie also consisted of an assortment of clichéd lines from what seemed to be Twilight. With lines like ""I'm an adult, old enough to make my own decisions,"" and ""We can't change the past, but we can change the future"", it is a wonder the movie received any views at all. Supplementing the trite dialogue was a series of mistakes in design and lighting. Susan Storm's hair color and length changes at least once every other scene, and the lighting was too dark for more than half the film, making all the dull scenes depressing as well.Unfortunately, I had to search for commendable qualities of this film, but a few respectable features were present. The background information of Reed's childhood was decent as it described his budding friendship with Ben and his early interest in the project. If only all the other characters had been given the same amount of time for background details, the movie might have been more engaging. Unfortunately, introduce-and-move-on is not an accepted plot structure, Josh Trank.Overall, the outcome and disorganized feel of ""Fantastic Four"" is deeply disappointing to many Marvel fans (including myself) especially since the quality of this movie could have been easily improved by adding more action scenes and focusing in on the history of each character. I certainly hope that Marvel and Twentieth Century Fox will not make the disastrous decision to produce another version in the foreseeable future. You've had enough chances.",Fantastic Four
889,gerardnru,this is not a movie,1,18 June 2016,I am not telling Anny spoilers here. I just saw this disaster of a movie on TV my god am i glad that i didn't pay money tho see this in the cinema. I mean nothing happens in this movie nothing at all. How can so many talented people make such a abomination. I can't believe this is from the same director of chronicle. That was a great found footage film. And i am just going to say it Johnny should be played by a white actor. Now all you people who think i am a racist here is an example. The new blade movie is coming out and blade will now be played by Gerald butler bow would you feel about that? It would suck. That is my opinion,Fantastic Four
890,jamieprice-73798,Don't believe the terrible ratings,10,17 April 2020,I watched this without checking here on IMDB for a rating which I'm glad I did otherwise I would have definitely passed on this movie as most of the ratings are so terrible. I really enjoyed the movie but obviously with the feedback that's out there I highly doubt they will make a sequel which is disappointing. I thought it was a really good origin story that left me wanting more I guess I'll have to wait 10 years till they decide to reboot it again.,Fantastic Four
891,pamelamaytsai,No expectations,9,10 July 2016,"I'm a huge fan our comic based movies. No expectations before watching. Never read reviews anyways. I thought the origin of Mr. F and The Thing was cute. Though others claimed about the dynamics - they're in a new relationship it takes time to develop. Things I didn't like was didn't really understand Doom's hate for earth and its inhabitants. Also how Mr. F just ran away. I suppose they needed the military to be involved to train to use their power. It may have been better for them to escape and learn to use their own abilities together. That may have made for better team building, instead of apart. Also didn't like The Thing's exploitation. Seemed somewhat irrelevant. But overall liked the actors and the movie. I'm looking forward to he sequel.",Fantastic Four
892,mghoupaei,well this is the first time i'm writing a review for a movie and also my mother language is not English so please forgive me for mistakes I promise I'll be better next time,4,25 July 2016,"I'm a big fan of characters so that's where I want to start, the characters are not the ones that they must be I mean they don't have the angles that they must have as an example I can mention johnny storm who is a boy with great sense of humor and a naughty boy who is hard to control which we saw burly of it in this movie then we come to Mr.fantastic that is really strange that a 5th year old boy has enough knowledge that can send things to other dimension! I know he is a genus but he should learned those heavy science from somewhere that's really odd even the way that they become involve in the project is not good we can accept the entrance of reed but you are telling me that one of the greatest mind in the world come to help just to get his racing car back!! the worst thing about this movie was bringing Ben Grimm (the thing) into the whole events that he is not related to anything but to be reed's childhood play mate or an assistant who doesn't have anything fantastic to be fit in the fantastic 4. rather than all these the movie that we spec some good action scenes hadn't much heartthrob scenes and the story line has not well shaped.If you ask me I believe even the cast weren't chosen well let's hope the next movie of this version be more fantastic.",Fantastic Four
893,FelipeDanilo,One of the worst superhero movies,2,10 January 2017,"Fantastic? Absolutely not! Director Josh Trank's intention may have been good, but he didn't make it effectively, and the result is disastrous and delivering one of the worst superhero movies ever made, which is a pity, because his previous film ""Chronicle"" is amazing. This Fantastic Four has a plot of 1h30min totally unavailable without any memorable scene with the final fight breathless and shameful. The visual effects are painful and poorly done, despite its budget of $120 million. The performances are disastrous, it seems that the actors did not want to be there. The saddest of all: it's the fourth film ever made of this team, but they don't learn from the mistakes and continue to make silly and depressing movies of the most beloved comic book heroes.",Fantastic Four
894,visionpeer,Too Childish,1,30 December 2016,This the lowest rated movie in my life. It simply is that good as I expected. Also not to mention the gibberish ending. Literally everything is too much predictable and unplanned. Next time Marvel next time. 3 is also too much I suppose. Also there are a lot of bogus stuff and the way the crew acted that way to lame. In fact I did not enjoy a moment it was total waste. There was a repeated story of the old version of the movie with new characters. What the hell is that for? I suppose that is the way a movie should be created. Most movies that have already been published are re-filmed and published among them this crap is also a member i suppose.,Fantastic Four
895,arhamidullin,Wow,3,18 April 2017,"This is already 4 movie about a fairly well-known team. The first came out in the early 90's turned out to be a cheap passing film which even on big screens was not allowed. Then, in the middle of the zero ones, another film was released, which was a rebut. Later released a sequel. In those days, I liked them. Having looked them over again, I realized that these are average, rather funny pictures.It's 2015 now. We were shown pretty steep trailers, gloomy, in the spirit of science fiction, looked good.And then the movie came out. Immediately, a barrage of negativity poured into him. Both from critics and from the audience. The film suffered a devastating failure, collecting a little more than its budget. At first I thought that this was again a through the grapevine, critics as always smell and so on. And I myself watched the movie. And all this criticism proved to be justified. The film is very weak. In all. Literally everything in him is bad. Now I will try to explain why this movie I think is bad.Usually the plot in such films is not in the first place. Usually blockbusters compensate with this action, humor, interesting characters. But there is nothing in this film.The effects themselves are very messy. Everything is done very cheaply. It would seem that the budget of 160 million dollars? Remember how a Thing tossed a tank, comments unnecessarily.The action in the film is almost nonexistent. He is in the finals, but he is poorly delivered and very short.The music is scarce. Sometimes it happens that a good soundtrack can make a movie floor. Well, at least give an epic and an atmosphere. Similar films I think should not be given, and so it is clear. Immediately the music is not remembered at all.The plot as I wrote is not particularly fashionable to criticize in such films, but still he is very trivial and smells of idiocy. I heard that the film was cut, changed, heard about the scandal. But we have what we have, there will not be a director's version. We have a very boring movie, with a stupid story line and a bad script. The tape is very boring.The actors played medium. The characters themselves do not develop at all. The script is so wretched that they decided to send the guys to another world because of drinking. The guys were just drunk. All.Here at last our heroes get beyond the ability. How do you think, what will happen next? A year later, a fantasy on the run, the rest help the military. That is, we do not show how the characters acquire the ability, how they live with it. It was just scored. The very nature of the characters are also strange. They do not develop at all.In this film there are a lot of dialogues, they are absolutely senseless.I do not want to say that this is the worst worst film in the world, but it's frankly very bad. And as a blockbuster, and as a regular film at times. But I still liked something. I liked the first 20 minutes of the film, this part is quite interesting. And then unfortunately went the pun that I wrote above.",Fantastic Four
896,earlisip,What the heck happened?,3,12 April 2019,"A crossover between fantastic four, X-Men and Avengers would've been awesome to see but after this movie, I highly doubt it's going to happen. The very first F4 was 50x better than this.",Fantastic Four
897,wondiebar,Bruuutal,1,5 June 2020,"Kept waiting for it to get good. Nothing happens.

898,davidpeligero,Disappointing,2,24 August 2017,"I was really looking forwards to watching this new Fantastic Four movie. I did not like the first movies mainly because of the bad casting. But now I can compare with this new one to realize they have taken this franchise up a notch in the bad movies scale.The casting for this movie is atrocious. Casting one of the smallest actors, Jamie Bell (and do not get me wrong, he is a fine actor but not for this role for Christ sake!) for one of the biggest characters in film history, the Thing... What is wrong with these people? And the Human Torch is now a black dude? It is not a racial thing but... Come on! You cannot change like this the main features of the story. The Doctor Doom character looks f*cking ridiculous, his face looks like a bald dorky puppet with funny eyes, not scary at all. Disappointing.",Fantastic Four
899,ballamere,Not as bad as I thought it would be,6,2 November 2017,"OK, it's not perfect at all, it has some really poor editing, some clunky dialogue and plot holes that gape wide open. However, the characters were fun, I enjoyed the use of youth over the ""rich scientist"" line from the earlier movies. It was really a DIY low tech fantastic four with true angst and almost dare I say it, believable to the performances. Dr Doom was poorly executed but was in line with the relative powers of the 4. So it stepped a long way from the spandex clad comic characters but to be honest that isn't a bad thing at all for me. Some great moments, I loved the Thing who really looked alive and rocky rather than orange and rubbery. The ending wasn't as explosive as other super hero movies but again, is that a bad thing ? does it always have to be a massive climax? So on the whole it worked as a fun 90 minutes, it wasn't the disaster many claim it to be as a movie anyway",Fantastic Four

I loved the fact that there wasn't that many fights scenes. The story was interesting by its own without adding action that wasn't needed. It was a good SF movie, even if, the movie in the end felt rushed... i wouldn't say it's a good super hero movie, so maybe that's why people didn't like it, but for me, i thought this was a more interesting approach to the concept.",Fantastic Four
