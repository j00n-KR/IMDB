0,MartinHafer,I wanted to hate this movie but couldn't--it was a wonderful surprise,8,20 July 2008,"In the last year or so, I think I've started to lose my mind. You see, up until then I avoided Adam Sandler movies--mostly because I so disliked him on ""Saturday Night Live"". However, in the last year or so, I have seen several of his older films that I actually liked. Now, this does NOT mean that I particularly liked all of his film! After all, BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE are hard to love--though I will admit that parts of them were pretty good. LITTLE NICKY, on the other hand, was just sludge! But CLICK, WATERBOY and now THE WEDDING SINGER are all movies that I grudgingly must admit were far better than I'd expected--especially THE WEDDING SINGER.I think the biggest reason I liked THE WEDDING SINGER was that it wasn't really a comedy but more of a romance--something that seemed to fit Sandler much better and I wish he'd consider making more of these. That's because although the film certainly stuck to established formula, the characters were all so very likable and sweet. As a result, you really cared about them and you got sucked into the story. One of the great moments was when the lady sang to her husband on their 50th anniversary and another was when Sandler had a heart-to-heart talk with his best friend in the bar. Of course you KNEW what had to happen by the end, but still you couldn't help but need a couple hankies--the writing, construction and acting were that good.On top of the characters, this is a great nostalgia piece that would appeal to people of my generation. Despite one reviewer saying that there was nothing positive about the 80s, this is when I met and married my wife. Hearing all the great songs and seeing the romance reminded me what a lucky guy I am.If you are looking for laugh out loud comedy, this probably isn't for you. Sure, there are a few funny moments (I REAAAALLY loved the song he composed both before and after he was dumped, for example), but the film is much more of a sweet romance. See this one with somebody you love--there are so many wonderful moments in it you can't help but enjoy yourself. An immensely enjoyable film.",The Wedding Singer
1,TheLittleSongbird,Funny & charming- also one of Adam Sandler's better movies,8,1 June 2010,"The film is a little too short, but other than that it is a funny, entertaining and charming romantic comedy. I don't care for Adam Sandler that much, as there have been movies where I have found him irritating, but here he gives one of his more likable performances because he is pitch-perfect here. Drew Barrymore is an actress I like, I think she is pretty and I think she can act(I loved her in Ever After), and she plays a truly charming romantic interest. Sandler and Barrymore's chemistry really works here, and they are supported wonderfully by some great supporting actors, Steve Buschemi being the funniest. The screenplay is funny and touching, the production values are a delight, the direction is secure and of course the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. Overall, just a nice and entertaining feel-good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Wedding Singer
2,SnoopyStyle,Sweet lovable duo,7,29 October 2013,"Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a lowly wedding singer. He gets left at the alter, and finds a true friend in waitress Julia Sullivan (Drew Barrymore) who's engaged to a douche.Drew Barrymore is supremely cute and lovable. Adam Sandler is still likable as the lovable loser. Together they make a wonderful on screen couple. She lights up the screen and he puts her on a pedestal.The music is stacked with great 80s hits. It has all the kitschy 80s touch. It makes all the fun in the world. The story is as predictable as most rom-coms. The humor is heart warming and sweet. Funniest bit has to be tranny bandmate George (Alexis Arquette) who keeps singing ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me"". It's not surprising that the script has so many great comedians who worked on it.",The Wedding Singer
3,mark.waltz,Back when it was OK to be a boomer!,8,28 June 2020,"For those of us who came of age in the 1980's and 1990's (or came of age in the 80's but didn't really grow up until the 1990's), this is a nostalgic, lovable reminder of the better times that took us past the fact that we had Reagan and Bush Sr. as presidents. We also had the early years of Madonna, Cindy Lauper, the Pet Shop Boys, fun dive bars crowded during daylight and fabulous party clothes. The music was filled with reverb, the movies gave us hope for romance, friendship and fabulous places to visit, and for a movie from the late 1990's to take us back to that time, it often brings on a tear of recollection and the thought of ""Where did the time go, and how do we get those good times back?""This is the funny, nostalgic, romantic story of wedding singer Robby Hart (Adam Sandler in his very best performance) and waitress Julia Sullivan (an endearingly sweet Drew Barrymore) dealing with their romantic issues. Robby's been dumped at the alter by his trashy fiancee (Angela Featherstone), and Julia's engaged to a real jerk (Matthew Clave), and their initial meeting at a fun-filled wedding leads to a friendship that turns to romance as they realize slowly how much they were made for each other. An ensemble of wacky characters become involved in every aspect of their life including Barrymore's easy but basically decent sister (Christine Taylor), the flashy but shy Alexis Arquette as Sandler's openly gay singing buddy, and especially Ellen Albertini Dow as his loving grandmother who brought him up.This film isn't just about the story; It is about references to 80's culture, with lots of little funny bits with advertising tie-ins (probably for products which no longer existed 12 years later), fashion trends and lots of various other cultural mentions of celebrities long out of the limelight. The elderly Ms. Dow will steal your heart from the moment you see her (she does for me in several other films as well), and it is certainly easy to root for Sandler and Barrymore in this, the first of several films they did together. The Broadway musical captured all of the magic of the original, and included two of the original songs written for this film including the sweet ""I Want to Grow Old With You"". Dow easily steals the scene with her very brief rap, and the only flaw is not letting her complete the song.",The Wedding Singer
4,lee_eisenberg,it almost makes you view the '80s positively,8,8 November 2005,"Like most Adam Sandler movies, ""The Wedding Singer"" is an excuse for him to be silly. In this case, he plays 1980s wedding singer Robbie Hart, who gets jilted at his own wedding. Ever the cool dude, he hooks up with waitress Julia Sullivan (Drew Barrymore), who's about to get married to the world's most undesirable person. But with a flair for popular culture, Robbie has a few of his own tricks planned.If nothing else, this movie is a look back on the era of Rubik's cubes. Having not grown up in that era, I can't verify the movie's accuracy (and wasn't the '80s really the era of Gordon Gekko?), but we can't dwell on that. The point is to revel in Adam Sandler's crazy gags. And boy does he have some!",The Wedding Singer
5,jboothmillard,The Wedding Singer,7,22 June 2016,"The star of Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy has had a mixed career, his lowest points being Mr. Deeds and Jack and Jill, but this was one of his well rated films I was really looking forward to seeing, directed Frank Coraci (The Waterboy, Click, Zookeeper). Basically in 1985, Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) dreamed of becoming a rock star, but he instead became an engaging and entertaining wedding singer in the town of Ridgefield, New Jersey. At his latest wedding gig, Robbie saves the wedding toast from being ruined by the groom's alcoholic best man David 'Dave' Veltri (Steve Buscemi), and he catches the eye of the function's waitress Julia Sullivan (Drew Barrymore), after the event they have a conversation. They both tell how they are engaged, Robbie is engaged to his girlfriend Linda (Angela Featherstone), and Julia to her boyfriend Glenn Guglia (Matthew Glave), because of Robbie's performance skills, and handling of an awkward situation, Julia wants him to sing at her wedding, Robbie happily agrees. Robbie and Linda's wedding day comes along, with all invited guests in attendance, but Linda does not show, it becomes apparent that Linda has changed her mind and no longer wants to go ahead with the wedding, Robbie is left heartbroken and despondent. Following their wedding being called off, Linda and Robbie meet up, she explains her concerns that being married to Robbie would mean that she will be stuck raising any kids they have in Richfield. Robbie's brother Sammy (Allen Covert) tries to cheer him up and gets him another wedding gig, but his sour mood disrupts the wedding toast, and sings a dour rendition of a song, following this Julia meets Robbie and hopes he will still play at her and Glenn's wedding, however he doubts his participation. Robbie's spirits do start to liven up when he does a Bah Mitzvah, with Julia acting as a waitress, after which she asks him to help her plan her wedding, he agrees, and they are also helped out by his brother Sammy and Julia's cousin Holly (Christine Taylor), they everything from trying wedding cakes and hiring Sammy as the only limo driver in town. When Robbie goes to a party with Julia, Holly and Julia's fiancé Glenn, he realises that Glenn is anything but a nice guy, especially as he ogles with other women, after everyone leaves Holly tries to hook up with Robbie, but he realises he has true feelings for Julia. Robbie contemplates and eventually decides to tell Julia how he feels, however arriving at her place, he sees her through her window in a wedding dress speaking happily in a mirror, he walks away disheartened, not realising, being unheard, she was actually speaking about him. Robbie gets drunk, stumbling from a bar he encounters Glenn, he attempts to punch him, but gets hit instead, and arriving back at his place, Linda is there, they both go inside. Julia shows up the next day to express her own feelings for him, but Linda answers the door, claiming to be ""Robbie's fiancée"", Julia returns home to Glenn and says she wants to get married as soon as possible, so they decide to head for Las Vegas. Robbie wakes up to Linda, she says that if she takes her back to marry she can get used to being the wife of a wedding singer, but he explains that he does not want to marry her, he then runs into Holly, who tells her Julie is going to Las Vegas. Robbie pressures Sammy to help, and he gets a First Class plane ticket, unaware that Julia and Glenn are on the same flight in Coach Class, Robbie finds out this and gets some help from his fellow First Class passengers, including rock and pop star Billy Idol. After the passengers help get rid of Glenn, Robbie finally expresses his feelings of true love to Julia through a song he wrote, they embrace, and in the end Robbie and Julia are married. Also starring Patch Adams' Ellen Albertini Dow as Rosie, Alexis Arquette as George, Friends' Christina Pickles as Angie Sullivan and Jon Lovitz as Jimmie Moore. Sandler gives a terrific performance, singing also, as the big- haired crooner with a heart of gold, Barrymore is suitably pretty and nice as his love interest, their chemistry work very well, this film made me laugh at the right times, and the love story is cute and cuddly, but this film also boasts a fantastic soundtrack of hit songs from the 1980s, a funny, enjoyable and good-natured romantic comedy. Very good!",The Wedding Singer
6,blanche-2,"Cute, warm film",7,11 April 2009,"Adam Sandler is one of those performers, like Jim Carrey, that one either likes or doesn't. However, over the years, he's taken on a variety of roles, and his comedy isn't always the same, either. ""The Wedding Singer"" is not a typical Adam Sandler film that found great popularity from a wide audience. I certainly didn't expect to like it, but I did.Set in the '80s, Sandler is Robbie Hart, once an aspiring singer/songwriter who sings at weddings and has an knack for livening up the festivities. Both Robbie and Julia are planning to get married to other people, but fate intervenes. For one thing, Robbie's intended Linda doesn't appear at their wedding (she met him when he was the lead singer in a rock band and now that he's doing receptions, the bloom is off the rose) and Julia's Wall Street broker boyfriend is a jerk. Robbie agrees to help Julia with her wedding, and then finds out that Julia's fiancée is marrying her out of duty because she dated him when he was poor. On top of which, he cheats.Both leads are wonderful, make a great couple, and the film is a lot of fun. The idea of '80s nostalgia in 1998 is funny as well. The film is bright and it's briskly directed by Frank Coraci.""The Wedding Singer"" is highly entertaining and has a lot of warmth. See it. Great fun.",The Wedding Singer

It is a nice (and funny) comedy about a guy (wedding singer Sandler) who has been dumped by his fiancee and is soon falls in love with (waitress) Drew Barrymore who is also engaged, but isn't in love either.

10,hitchcockthelegend,Love doesn't stink you know?,8,24 September 2009,"Robbie Hart is a popular wedding singer who's life gets flipped upside down after he is jilted at the altar. Enter pretty waitress Julia who's all set to marry her supposedly dream guy.Oh the 80s was a fun decade, few like to own up to it, but yeah it was colourful and...The 80s, a time of big hair, Miami Vice fashions, red leather jackets and the Michael Jackson glove. All of which gets captured perfectly in Frank Coraci's The Wedding Singer.Starring Adam Sandler as Robbi and Drew Barrymore as Julia, The Wedding Singer is a simple, but highly effective boy meets girl frothathon. The story has been told a million times in a number of other eras, but how many really tap into the zeitgeist of the time the way Coraci's movie does? A great soundtrack is backed up by a lovely poignant script, and our two protagonists are chemistry personified. Wonderful humorous support comes from Alexis Arquette as a Boy George wannabe, and Steve Buscemi pops in with one of the funniest cameos of the 90s.It's possible that The Wedding Singer only really strikes a chord with those who were youth of the 80s? (it made over $100,000,000 profit though), and rest assured this is only one side of the decade we are witnessing. But it has charm in abundance and it's funny and irresistibly joyous. It has flaws if one wanted to delve down deep into the production, but really, why would you? They haven't made a film for intellectuals and muso's of the cinematic medium. They made a film about love in the 1980s and slyly took the rise on the way.Now where did I leave my glove? 8/10",The Wedding Singer
11,CinemaSerf,"""She's going to be called Julia Guglia""",6,15 August 2020,"This is a quite a jolly rom-com with Adam Sandler as a rather cheesy wedding singer (""Robbie"") engaged to ""Linda"" (Angela Featherstone). When things don't quite go to plan on his wedding day, he begins to develop a friendship with ""Julia"" (Drew Barrymore) who is herself engaged to the rather unpleasant ""Glenn Guglia"" (Matthew Glave). Using a cracking soundtrack from the 1980s, the film tells the story of the ups and downs of their burgeoning romance. Sandler is the nice guy here, and from the start he has the audience rooting for him; he's one of those folks who'd step into the path of a Chieftain tank to rescue a kitten; and his singing coach scenes with the elderly Ellen Dow (""Rosie') just make you want to take him home to your mother for ice cream and cookies. Alexis Arquette steals it for me, however, as the would be Boy George and there's a fun cameo at the end from Billy Idol. Lots of big hair, shoulder pads and a gently nostalgic reminder of the days when the music was certainly much more memorable than the film!",The Wedding Singer

13,anaconda-40658,Sandler & Barrymore Unite!,7,11 May 2015,"The Wedding Singer (1998): Dir: Frank Coraci / Cast: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Christine Taylor, Allen Covert, Billy Idol: Flashy 1980's nostalgia referring to one factor placed outside a medium. Adam Sandler plays a wedding singer whose girlfriend dumps him. Yet he feels forced to observe the happiness of others while he conceals his pain within song lyrics. He wants to be a songwriter but lost his passion after being stood up on his wedding day. He surveys the guests informing who will never find love. Drew Barrymore plays a waitress who insists that he sing at her wedding until he learns that her fiancé is a cheater. Director Frank Coraci highlights with great 80's music. Sandler is likable and many viewers will likely relate to his trauma with the exception of its lackluster climax aboard a plane. Barrymore survives predictable elements and steals the film with her false visions of love. Christine Taylor and Allen Covert appear in flat supporting roles as those friends often confessed too in movies and either offer the good advice or just conveniently appear with necessary. Then there is musician Billy Idol making an appearance playing himself and it leaves the impression that perhaps acting isn't his strong point. The 1980's pop songs should bring memories for those whom lived through the era. Theme lays emphases on our ability to crush or mend the spirit of others. Score: 7 / 10",The Wedding Singer
14,FlashCallahan,Love Stinks......,7,26 May 2012,"Robbie is stood up at the altar by Linda, who decides that the prospect of marrying a guy who sings at wedding receptions doesn't equal the attraction she felt when he was lead singer in a rock band.Robbie finds consolation in his friendship with Julia, a waitress at the wedding receptions and bar mitzvahs where he performs.Julia asks Robbie to help her plan her upcoming wedding to Glenn, who isn't interested in the details of the ceremony.Robbie learns that Glenn also isn't totally interested in Julia and is marrying her because she ""deserves it"" after sticking with him for years and because he knows she's not marrying him for his money, since she dated him back before he started pulling down the big bucks...It's not your typical Sandler movie. There are no where near as many sight gags and rants as you get in his other movies. This is 'The Ladies' Adam Sandler, as you have also seen in '50 first dates' and 'Big Daddy'.It's ultimately a chick flick with a slight Sandler Sheen. All of his regulars are here, but they play it more straighter than usual.But it's a god film. The chemistry between the two leads is fantastic, and they should make more movies together.If you, like myself, love the eighties, then this is the pinnacle tribute to the eighties. Big Hair, Big egos, and Billy Idol.A movie that will brighten your day up.",The Wedding Singer
15,safenoe,Lays on the 80s thick...and I love it!,8,11 September 2017,"I love The Wedding Singer and Adam Sandler plays such a sweet lead role who is incredibly lovable, and I guess this movie constituted Drew Barrymore's comeback again, shedding her E.T. stereotype once and for all. The 80s references come thick and fast, and Billy Idol's appearance was a classic big time. I wonder if there will be a remake of The Wedding Singer and whether it brings it forward to the 90s or the 00s even?",The Wedding Singer
16,The_Void,Great entertainment with a lot of heart,7,23 September 2004,"A little known fact about me is that I'm a big fan of fluffy romantic comedies. Why wouldn't you want to spend 90 minutes or so watching a film; laughing and ultimately feeling good at the end of it? I don't consider fluffy romance films to be at the absolute top of cinema, but they're good fun, and therefore get a thumbs up from me. The Wedding Singer, however, gets not one thumb up; but both thumbs, firmly, up. So, why does The Wedding Singer succeed more than most films in it's sub genre? Is it the jokes? The beautiful female lead? The gratuitous helping of 80's pop songs? No, it's that this movie has a lot of heart; that's what makes it a winner.Adam Sandler stars as the quintessential 'loser'. He's a wedding singer, and not a very good one either. He specialises in doing terrible covers of 80's songs. It's not the sort of act that I would want at my wedding. His life gets worse one day, his wedding day, to be exact, when someone doesn't turn up. The bride, that is. Now in a deep spiral of depression, our hero doesn't see any way forward. His next gig is a washout and there's love all around him; even his newfound friend, the cute little waitress that works at the same place as him is getting married. And to a man who doesn't deserve her, I might add. I don't think I really need to tell you what comes next, but even though it's a predictable ride; trust me, it's a ride you want to be on. Adam Sandler tends to be a very annoying actor; and for that reason he is almost universally disliked, but it is undeniable that he is good in this movie. Nobody else could have given the character what Sandler gave him; his performance is both entertaining and believable, and therefore is just right for the movie. Drew Barrymore was also perfectly cast. She is the perfect girl in this movie; all smiles and sunshine, and it's impossible not to fall in love with her. The movie also features great little turn from Steve Buscemi, who provides the film with one of it's funniest moments towards the start.As mentioned; The Wedding Singer has a lot of heart. From the way that the characters interact with each other, particularly Sandler and Barrymore, it is obvious that they are in love. The movie also has some points to make on the subject of love; The Wedding Singer portrays that being in love is overall better than being a 'Fonz' type, womanising character. The message at the movie's centre is also a worthwhile one; the movie professes that it isn't important who you fall in love with; it doesn't matter whether or not he's merely a wedding singer, all that matters is the love between two people. The movie says that love is all you need; and that is a worthwhile message in any movie. The movie's message is lost somewhat under the barrage of jokes; but it's most certainly there and I for one think that it's a shame that a movie that is entertaining and funny can't be considered in the same league as other, more serious movies with a similar message.Overall, The Wedding Singer is at the very top of the romantic comedy genre. It will make you laugh, and you will ultimately feel for the characters. The fact that this movie has something to say is only another reason to recommend it; especially as it says it with a great big smile on it's face. The Wedding Singer is not a film that you will want to miss; it's feel-good at it's best.",The Wedding Singer
17,Sylviastel,A great fun film to watch for the whole family!,8,13 September 2004,"I was just watching the Wedding Singer last night on television. I still love this film for all its quirks. I love the fact that it was set in the eighties. Contemporary music and MTV with all its real world shows are not the same as in the eighties. I become very nostalgic watching this film. I remember all the songs, the Madonna look of the moment, the Rubix cube, Freddy Kruger, etc. It is hard to believe that it's almost twenty years since 1985. It was much better in 1985 for me, I was still a child and there were always music videos on MTV. They weren't just concert videos neither. They told little stories. I wished that we were still in the eighties with the music and culture. Besides all the eighties stuff, they never tried to outdo it in the film. It really is a beautiful, sweet love story between Drew Barrymore's character, Julia, and the wedding singer, Robby Hart. I love the flight to Vegas and I won't spoil the ending for anybody else. The scenes at reception hall were always a pleasure to watch and a great cast. I love watching fellow SNL--Jon Lovitz, Laura Kightlinger, Kevin Nealon, play even small roles. I loved Ellen Law playing Rosie. She was the best supporting character in this film. The fact that Billy Idol is also in it playing himself is another reason to watch. I wish there were films about the 80s.",The Wedding Singer

19,Mr-Fusion,"As a teenager, this was hilarious",5,10 August 2015,"My attitude towards ""The Wedding Singer"" has really taken a dive over the years. I remember when everyone was talking about it in high school, and it was pretty good. This was back when ironic gag-a-minute '80s humor was funny. Now, it just seems half-assed (a DeLorean rolls up playing the ""Miami Vice"" theme). There are still a couple of good laughs here and there: Jon Lovitz, the rapping granny, Frank Silvero), but the romcom formula is being played to the fullest here - two destined lovers kept apart by misunderstandings, miscommunications, etc. - and Sandler's this ridiculously sensitive milquetoast. Were it not so syrupy, this would be easier to stomach.5/10",The Wedding Singer
20,StevePulaski,Take the mic and shove it,3,27 November 2013,"The Wedding Singer opens with a pretty damn-good cover of ""You Spin Me Right Round"" by Dead or Alive by Adam Sandler and company, which provided me with optimism that this would be a more controlled Sandler affair with more intelligently written humor and some solid drama between characters. Certainly The Wedding Singer doesn't show Adam Sandler at his most manic and uncontrollable, but during some instances, you can see writer Tim Herlihy is fighting his urges. Consider the morosely unfunny scene where, upon being dumped by his fiancé, the titular character (Sandler) lumbers through a performance at a wedding spewing unconscionable bouts of hatred and mean-spirited anger. But it's funny, right? Not in my eyes. The Wedding Singer, in my eyes, is another Sandler disaster. A film with a two-faced protagonist, a caricature of a love-interest, a terribly trite and predictable plot, and humor as reliable as a twenty-year old with well over 100,000 miles on it. The film isn't offensive in the casual sense, but in the deeper, more depressing sense that while senseless drivel like this is getting made, real writers and determined screenwriters getting turned away from the higher-ups because their material is too ambitious or too risky.It's 1985 and Adam Sandler stars as Robbie Hart, a popular choice for a wedding singer in Connecticut. Robbie is engaged to his girlfriend Linda (Angela Featherstone), but finds himself alone on his wedding day. However, while on the job, Robbie meets Julia (Drew Barrymore), a waitress who works many of the same venues where Robbie performs. Unfortunately, now that Robbie is single and recognizes that Julia may indeed make a great girlfriend, she is engaged to cocky businessman Glenn Gulia (Matthew Glave). So Robbie gets sidelined to help Julia plan the wedding when deep down he knows he should be her husband.Immediately, this film houses clichés I'm tiring greatly of. The first is the dimwit that we're supposed to like and sympathize with despite the stupid actions he commits consistently (usually a cliché in a Sandler film). The second is where the guy finds the perfect soul almost instantaneously after breaking it off with his girlfriend. Others include the expected fact that the dreamgirl is dating an unbecoming jerk, despite the guy's obnoxiousness the girl is obviously above, she still sees him as a mature and respectable guy, and the ridiculous ending we need to live with at the end of the film where everything is nicely patched up and elegantly concluded.Clichés work against a film, most definitely, but it also doesn't help in any particular saving grace-fashion when a comedy's wit is just at the near bottom of the barrel. Take for example the elderly woman Robbie can be seen assisting often over the course of the film. In the beginning of the film, upon first seeing her, we are, I guess, supposed to laugh because she is not your typical elderly lady with her quick wit and her efforts to fill Robbie's hands with meatballs and demanding he eat them then and there. But later on, Robbie has a discussion with her about his relationships where she can welcome in such fascinating commentary on Robbie perhaps being self-conscious about the size of his private area or other points that don't need to be brought up. The fatal kicker for the jokes with the elderly woman is what she says isn't funny but the fact that she's very old and saying such things is the humor of the situation.Barrymore and Sandler do have evident chemistry, especially during the drama of the later sequences, but it's very much undermined thanks to the film's middle-school attitude throughout the entire course of the film. The Wedding Singer, according to audience opinion, ranks among the higher margin of Sandler films, but I see nothing but the same unfunny schlock in smaller, more manageable piles. That's like saying a relatively messy park is more fun to play in than a filthier park when, frankly, I'd be keen on just staying home.Starring: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Angela Featherstone, Matthew Glave, Allen Covert, and Peter Dante.

It doesn't rank as high in the laugh category as Sandler's earlier film, ""Happy Gilmore,"" but it provides just enough sweetness and guffaws to recommend.The movie is filmed with a very eighties-feel, and that is mixed with the humor of Adam Sandler, so it's pretty easy to imagine what the film is going to be like.I recommend you sit down some night, grab a tub of popcorn, and just enjoy this movie for what it is: an instantly forgettable comedy that serves its purpose: a nice night in.3/5 stars -John Ulmer",The Wedding Singer
24,DKosty123,Sadler-Barrymore Works,8,1 October 2007,"This film really centers on Adam Sadler's character. In saying that, this is a bit young a Sadler than now, but in this movie, Sadler proves early one that he can do comedy, drama, & pathos. Drew Barrymore, while not having anywhere near as much script, doesn't show all the range but is pleasant enough as the femme fatal in the end.It is interesting the wedding cancellation of the ""other woman"" who leaves him at the altar so to speak. I think the overall film would be stronger if her character were developed more fully. There could have been some funnier sequences if she were developed enough that her character & Barrymores have more of a contest for Adams character. Along with that, you can't really see why he was going to marry her to start with. There is no energy between her character & Adam's.Adam Sadler is brilliant as the wedding singer. I am not sure anyone else could have played this role as well. The humor is light & the chemistry between him & Drew Barrymores character is electric. This to me is his best performing film that I have seen.",The Wedding Singer

I never expected the movie to be as good as it is because of exactly that. However, this was the only Adam Sandler movie I haven't seen at this point so I gave it a try. I was very impressed.This is about a guy named Robbie Hart who is a successful wedding singer. Things turn for the worst when his wife leaves him at his own wedding. He becomes a depressed person and is on the verge of losing his job. Then he becomes best friends with a waitress. Will they fall in love? Even though Sandler is his usual typical self, he shows a heart-warming side of him. He shows some dramatic acting skills for the first time. Drew Barrymore is just fantastic as the waitress. The rest of the supporting actors were great as well.Overall, this is a funny, heart-warming film for all. This may be Adam's best movie. I rate this film 9/10.",The Wedding Singer

This is probably my favorite Adam Sandler movie.,The Wedding Singer
28,lesleyharris30,"Not Hilarious but Also not Unfunny,",7,2 August 2014,"The Wedding Singer is a good movie with a good storyline and a great comedic cast.It certainly isn't Adam Sandlers finest movie,but it's not his worst either,there are several funny scenes throughout but there are also a lot of misses.This is the first movie to star Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore,and from the very first scene you can see and almost feel the amazing chemistry between them and it is certainly the movies highlight.The thing that bothered me the most about this movie is that it is set in the eighties but rarely makes reference to it (other than the music),it makes a small reference every now and again,like a mention of Dallas,to remind us it's set in the eighties,but I think it should have made constant references instead of just a few at times to remind the audience.There are some great cameos and they are certainly some of the funniest parts,particularity Steve Buscemi and Jon Lovitz's scenes.The Wedding Singer is nothing outstanding but it is very enjoyable and I would recommend it as a short and sweet comedy to watch if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. A waitress catches the eye of a wedding circuit singer who is distraught after being dumped at the alter of his own wedding.Best Performance: Adam Sandler Worst Performance: Matthew Glave",The Wedding Singer
29,The-Sarkologist,Absolutely Delightful,8,19 April 2020,"It's been a while since I last watched this film, and it certainly doesn't fall into the typical Adam Sandler type of film, namely that a man-child is forced to grow up. In fact, it is sort of completely the opposite, though I'm not entirely sure whether his character in this film would strictly be considered a man-child. Yet, in another sense, I guess it is also one of those films when the main characters are trying to come to grips with who they are and what they really actually want in life.Basically, it is about Bobby Hart, a guy that sings in a band at weddings. He used to be in a band, but that sort of fell through, and these days he works at a reception hall singing for weddings, and also teaching people to sing, and being paid in meatballs. He was supposed to get married, but his fiancee decided that she didn't want to do it anymore, namely because he hadn't become the rock star that she thought he would become when she first met him.So, he meets this young lady named Julia who is also working for the same reception place, and they become friends. Now, Julia is also engaged to get married, but not surprisingly the guy that she is going to marry is a bit of tool. The thing is that they whole movie is really all about how Bobby and Julia realise that they actually like each other more than their respective partners, and as such, like all romantic comedies, you can probably guess how it ends.Yeah, this is one of those interesting films, and I guess it raises all these questions about who we should marry, why we should marry, and whether we are actually marrying the right person. Mind you, I doubt that weddings have been called off because of this film, namely because you really don't know what a person is like until you take off those rose coloured glasses, an in many cases we really don't want to do that because, well, we don't know what we will see.There is this discussion as to why we marry who we marry, and one of the things comes down to security. Like, I actually think that this security is more a security against loneliness, something that for some reason your best friend can provide you with, but a partner for some reason can. Yet I still feel that this film, like a lot of the romantic comedies out there, really does lack a lot of realism. Sure, Julia is this really nice guy that right from the beginning has been having second thoughts about this guy that she was going to marry, but was going ahead with it anyway because, well, it just seems to be the right thing to do, and in anyway he is also quite wealthy.Still, I did find this film to be rather delightful, and funny in that rather Adam Sandler sort of way as well. In fact, I ended up originally watching it simply because of Adam Sandler, who happened to be a bit of a popular actor around the time the film was release, especially with Happy Gilmore. Normally, though, I don't like romantic comedies, but Adam Sandler, especially with the way he does play the perfect man boy, is able to pull it so that in the end I'll enjoy it.Oh, and I do love the tributes to the 80s, not just the music, but a number of jokes that maybe only those of us who lived through the 80s will get. Well, yeah, there is also the mullet, which is definitely so 80s, but there is also the Van Halen joke, and Billy Idol (though he certainly did look older in this film than he did when he was in the 80s). Yeah, this film definitely has a lot of nostolgia value about it.",The Wedding Singer
30,Floated2,Entertaining at parts,6,26 October 2017,"The Wedding Singer is considered one of Adam Sandler's better comedy films and especially of his earlier films of his career. The film is what is to be expected, with Sandler portraying his typical nice lovable guy that ends up winning over the love interest. There are some bits of amusement and entertainment but overall the film is quite predictable and is what is expected. The Wedding Singer is not quite like his earlier comedies, where the comedy is more juvenile, silly and over the top. Which is why many consider this of a more mature film. Overall, the Wedding Singer will bring back nostalgia for many and is another reason as to why it is as praised as it is, though it is quite sappy and not in a good way.",The Wedding Singer

A few years later I watched and I haven't stop watching it since. This is one of the great movie romances. It's a wildly satisfying movie. The cast is terrific. The story is sweet. And, of course, the music is great. There a few clunker jokes here and there but they are all erased by more than a few moments of greatness.

The plot is funny, fast paced, charming and it could also serve as a life experience for some kind of guys. The acting is really good. Sandler delivers his best role in his career (my opinion), Dru Barrymore is as cute and charming as always, and Christine Taylor is as sexy as always. The humor works perfectly for the movie's tone and you can really feel a special vibe between the main characters. Also, you can relate to them and understand their situations.While the resolution of the movie is the typical manner of following Hollywood's standards; it works perfectly. You know, the good girl having a slezeball as fiancée who understand she ""wants"" to be with the anti-hero. The musical numbers add a special something.

The music is really the big deal there. 1985 is major then. This movie combines romance, comedy, and most of all the music hits of the time. Adam Sandler plays Robbie Hart, a wedding singer who gets stood up on his own wedding. Drew Barrymore plays Julia Sullivan, a wedding caterer who plans to get married to a successful man who happened to be ""Mr. Wrong"". Robbie(Sandler) sings to couples at the reception, when he got stood up, he wants to make their lives just as miserable as his. I liked the part where he she goes off on his bride-to-be. But when she tries to make it up, he came to his senses. His grandmother is very kind, and that meatball holding, I think its cute. She really took it down when she did ""Rapper's Delight"" when she renewed her vows. Billy Idol made a great cameo when he helped fix Julia's player fiancé Glen Gulia(Matt Glave). What a loser! Love works in mysterious ways, and the results are usually great. It's a gemstone out of all of Adam Sandler's movies. It's a must have and a must see. 3 out of 5 stars!",The Wedding Singer

This by-the-numbers Adam Sandler / Drew Barrymore vehicle is rescued from mediocrity by a ridiculously good soundtrack, an unexpectedly sweet vat of chemistry between the two leads and one big, fat, steaming gob of '80s nostalgia. Sandler and Barrymore don't exactly light the screen on fire with their acting chops - in fact, most of their lines are so stiff and hammy, I'm surprised they made the cut - but there's a strange, genuine warmth that resonates between them, and the film uses those sparks to fuel a bonfire. The plot isn't as edgy and obtuse as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, but that ultimately results in a smoother, more digestible picture that's still not without a few of Sandler's signature left-field moments. Heartfelt and funny, it's also thin enough to need the not-too-distant throwback setting as a crutch.",The Wedding Singer

Sandler tones down his typical shtick in favor of a more good natured performance, and Drew Barrymore could not be more adorable as the object of his affections.

40,jimbo-53-186511,One of Sandler's more likable offerings,7,4 October 2016,"Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer who himself is due to marry his fiancée Linda (Angela Featherstone). However, when Robbie finds himself being jilted by his fiancée on their wedding day he finds himself at an all-time low. Robbie strikes up a friendship with Julia Sullivan (Drew Barrymore) who is also due to marry her fiancée Glenn Guglia (Matthew Glave) and by spending time with Robbie she begins to question whether Glenn is really the right man for her.The Wedding Singer's rather flimsy premise of 'boy meets girl' and 'boy and girl being betrothed to the wrong partners' is in itself rather banal. However, I have to admit that I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film as a whole. I think the main thing that runs in the film's favour is that it is so likable and it also helps that Sandler plays a likable character - he's so much better when he just plays things straight like he does here.Although the premise is flimsy, it is at least believable and I'm sure we've all come across people like Glenn, Robbie and Julia in our lives. This is one of the reasons it works in that it has a rather down-to-earth premise, but one that also is sweet-natured and one that also has some nice messages thrown in for good measure. As well as being a sweet film, it's also a film that is very funny too - although it's a film that has sporadic intervals of humour rather than being consistently funny. This isn't a problem as it's clear that director Frank Coraci and writer Tim Herilhy wanted to generally maintain a warm-hearted tone so for me it was a fairly balanced film.The cast are also on top form here with both Sandler and Barrymore being adorable together. Glave is very good as the snobbish up his own backside fiancée of Barrymore and likes of Christine Taylor and Allen Covert also offer good support.The ending of the film was a blast and contains a cameo from an icon from the 80's. Things do get a bit mawkish and mushy towards the end, but with a film that's as lovely as The Wedding Singer none of this really matters.This is definitely one of the better Sandler offerings which manages to be sweet, likable and most importantly have fun whilst it's doing all of these things.",The Wedding Singer

42,barnabyrudge,"Well-made, engaging romantic comedy.",8,29 February 2008,"Adam Sandler had made generally second-rate comedy fillers prior to The Wedding Singer. Films like Billy Madison, Bulletproof and Happy Gilmore  very straightforward, run-of-the-mill comedy films. The Wedding Singer has a lot more to it than that, and is a surprisingly enjoyable and witty romantic comedy. The trick is very simple  it's a film about people. No fancy plot devices, no special effects, no action thrown in to spice things up  just real and funny characters caught up in a situation that anyone can identify with.In the 1980s, wedding singer Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) makes friends with a pleasant waitress named Julia (Drew Barrymore) at a wedding party. The pair of them get on incredibly well but neither notices the chemistry between them as both are already engaged to their respective lovers. In Robbie's case, the attractive but incompatible Linda (Angela Featherstone); in Julia's case the successful and materialistic Glenn (Matthew Glave). When Robbie is jilted at the altar by Linda, he sinks into depression but is helped through the tough times by Julia. During this time he realises that he actually has feelings for her, a fact that Julia herself also awakens to. Julia begins to have serious doubts about whether she truly wants to spend the rest of her life with Glenn but her family and friends convince her that she is merely suffering from a few pre-wedding jitters. However, when Robbie finds out that Glenn is a love rat who sleeps around with other women he realises that the time is right to declare his love to Julia. But circumstances conspire to jeopardise his plan, and Robbie has to chase Julia to Las Vegas before she unwittingly marries the wrong guyWhat makes the film better than a standard romantic comedy is the clever '80s background, with clothing, fashion, hair-styles, music tastes and phrases all perfectly captured from the era. In one great scene, Robbie instructs Linda to stop wearing his Van Halen T-shirt: ""please get out of my Van Halen T-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up!"" Little subtle gags like this run throughout the film and make it a pleasure to come back for repeat viewings. The dialogue is generally very good, with lots of quick witted sarcasm and one-liners. But the film remembers also to set aside time for the emotional and romantic elements, so that it doesn't just become a soulless gag-fest. Sandler proves for perhaps the first time in his career that he is a likable and subtle actor, capable of creating a character with personality rather than sticking to type. Similarly, Barrymore gives her sweetest performance in years  the chemistry between them is unexpectedly warm and genuine. Indeed, the entire cast create memorable and amusing characters, right down to a hilarious cameo from Billy Idol. There's really not much wrong with The Wedding Singer  it's a little conventional and the outcome is wholly predictable, but these are minor quibbles in an otherwise well-made, engaging and genuinely funny comedy flick.",The Wedding Singer

I mean, there's a lucky select few that are either geniunly funny or have nostalgic value (Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy and the absurdly fascinating Little Nicky come to mind), but he's just such a ball of cancer on screen it's hard to actively see his stuff. The Wedding Singer, however, is a really sweet little movie, and works well thanks to an impressive 80's soundtrack and the presence of Drew Barrymore, who frequently hangs around in Sandler's stuff. He plays Robbie Hart here, a singer who belts out the hits of the 1980's at weddings, parties, you name it. After being left at the alter by his fiancé, he spots waitress Julia (Barrymore), who uncannily seems to be working every event she is. The two form a bond, but she is engaged to another dude (Matthew Glave), who quickly is revealed to be kind of a jerkoff, prompting Robbie to go to great lengths to prove, and win Julia's heart. The film makes the absolute most of its setting, as any period piece should. The music is a delight, right down to the amusing dawn of the 'CD', and a great little cameo from a rock legend aboard an airline. Some of the usual troupe of Sandler disciples pop up here, including Christine Taylor, Allen Covert, Kevin Nealon, Peter Dante, Jon Lovitz and Steve Buscemi, who can be counted on to appear in pretty much any Adam flick you can think of.

Not really all that well done as a satire or a romantic comedy, ""The Wedding Singer"" does benefit from an amiable cast.I have never been a huge Adam Sandler fan, yet he has gone some way here to winning me over with a goofy, awkward turn as ""The Wedding Singer"" whose life is ruined when he is left standing at the altar. Drew Barrymore is ""Julia"", the sweet girl-next-door who wins Robbie's heart and gives him something to live for. This is the sort of role Drew is perfect for, and it's a shame we don't see her like this more often.

This movie is best watched among a group of your closest 80's friends. It is a comedy classic and my only beef with it is it makes me miss the 80's so much! Basically, I love this movie! Nothing more nothing less. Wedding Singer is among my top 20 favorite movies ever-one of the best comedies and GREAT music as well! The best of the eighties music(and I do count ""you spin me round"" as one of them!) This movie pays tribute to a great time period and retains a place in my heart as both sweet/sentimental and roll on the floor funny. Watch it if you haven't, you will be hysterical. Oh man do I miss the 80's!!!!",The Wedding Singer
53,philip_vanderveken,"Making fun of the 1980's, what a great idea.",6,22 July 2005,"Normally I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. All the movies that I've seen from him so far didn't really do it for me or were just bad. That's the reason why I normally wouldn't have watched this movie, but because a few people told me that I should give it a try anyway, since this was definitely one of his better ones, I hoped for the best.In this movie Adam Sandler plays the role of Robbie Hart, a man who sings the hits of the 1980's at weddings and other celebrations. He has seen many couples getting married and is prepared for everything when it's up to him to get married with his fiancée. But nothing could prepare him for what she does to him. She dumps him at the altar, making him loose all believe in true love. In the meantime he has also met Julia, a waitress at the events where he performs and with who he has become good friends. She too is about to marry, but has made the wrong choice of partner as well. The only problem is that she doesn't know it yet and Robbie doesn't know if he should tell her or not...Although many jokes didn't really work very well for me, I still had a good time with this movie. I know that may sound a bit strange, but the main reason for that is because they made fun of one of the worst periods in pop history, the 1980's. The entire movie is situated in 1985 and you'll get to see several sidekicks dressed as Madonna, Boy George from the Culture Club,... but also other events like for instance the very first CD player. But what I probably liked most about this movie were the performances of Steve Buscemi as the drunk best man on one of the weddings and Drew Barrymore. And yes I admit it, I even appreciated Adam Sandler in this movie.Overall this isn't a bad movie and Sandler certainly isn't as annoying as in his other movies. I'm not going to say that I would buy it, but if it is shown on TV again, I might give it another try. Sure the romantic stuff was sweet, but thanks to Drew Barrymore who played the perfect 'girl next door' in this movie, I was able to cope with that. I give this movie a 6.5/10.",The Wedding Singer
54,rivertam26,Wonderful,9,15 July 2020,"This is the first Barrymore/Sandler collaboration and it would prove to be a successful formula. Set in the awesome 80s it centers around Robbie Hart played by an awesome Adam Sandler, he's an awesome wedding singer and an all around nice guy. He's engaged to be married and ends up left at the altar. He ends up beginning a friendship with a waitress named Julia played by a lovable Drew Barrymore whose engaged to a douchebag. They of course end up falling for eachother and hilarious problems ensue. The film is truly a perfect romantic comedy. No matter how many times I watch it, I still get so into it.

55,KUAlum26,Turning point for Mr.Sandler,8,18 December 2008,"Once a believer in true love,carefree singer/musician Robbie Hart(Adam Sandler,revisiting hair of yore)has his world dashed when his fiancée,a shallow and fickle groupie-type(Angela Featherstone)leaves him on their wedding day. Since the sad irony of this comes in the fact that Robbie's main gigs are weddings(hence the title),this crushes him double. He finds comfort(and eventually more)in a pretty,equally idealistic caterer named Julia(Drew Barrymore,all bright and chipper,nearly shed of her once ""bad girl"" image). Another whammy:said caterer is to be engaged to a super oily Yuppie type(Matthew Glave). What's a hopeless romantic to do? Wink wink.Set in the 1980s--specifically,a 1985 I barely recognize--this film captures as much pop culture and music from the period as it can. Director Frank Coraci and writer(formerly of SNL,no doubt the inspiration for those endless ""Herlihy Boy"" sketches)Tim Herlihy have no shame in making this a tribute/mild parody of the Reagan era. Adam Sandler is the star,both in set-up and in delivery in this film,delivering in my opinion a truly well-rounded and likable character,putting to work his persona and edging down his tendency to go sophomoric in previous efforts such as Billy MAdison or Happy Gilmore(moderately funny movies but about as weighty as fart-tinged helium). He and BArrymore make a likable couple,and this movie makes for easy viewing that can go though multiple viewings. A cheap rent or an easy find on basic cable.",The Wedding Singer
56,Sirus_the_Virus,My favorite Adam Sandler comedy.,9,5 September 2009,"I have liked just about every Adam Sandler comedy. Despite a few bad films, he will still get me to watch his films. The Wedding singer is my favorite of Adam Sandler's comedies. Sandler, I think, is a funny guy. I will see just about every one of his films, even if they look stupid. I don't like him as much as Jim Carrey, but I still think he is very funny. These are the order in which I like Adam Sandler's films.The Best1. The Wedding singer2. Happy Gilmore3. ClickThe Worst3. Billy Madison2. I now pronounce you Chuck and Larry1. The WaterboyYou may not agree with my list. If you don't, then you're a moron. I know i'm one to judge, but there is no way that you could disagree with that list. I didn't like The Waterboy because everything about it is just stupid. I liked Kathy Bates, but the rest of The Waterboy is a disaster. The Wedding singer is not pure stupidity, it's a funny romantic comedy that I really liked up until the end. The end of the film was sort of silly. Why would all of these flight attendants team up against Glen(Matthew Glave, I think that's his name)for Robbie(Adam Sandler)? They throw Glen in the bathroom and close the door. I just think it's a little silly. I would be suing their asses. But anyways, this is my favorite Adam Sandler comedy because it's not all fart jokes and stuff. Like 50 first dates, it's part romance. Not that serious though. I liked Drew Barrymore in this film as Julia, the love interest. I know the plot of the film may seem recycled, but the film's heart is gold. I also liked The Wedding Singer because of it's great soundtrack. I think The Wedding singer is Adam Sandler's finest film yet, though it gets silly towards the end. The Plot: Robbie Hart is a wedding singer who was recently engaged and is now separated. Robbie is hired to do a waitress named Julia's wedding. While working with Julia, he soon realizes that she is engaged to a jerk and that he is in love with her.",The Wedding Singer

Check it out.",The Wedding Singer
59,jaredmobarak,Kiss my gritsThe Wedding Singer,7,15 July 2007,"No matter how big an Adam Sandler fan I am, I will admit that most of his films are crap. I don't mean the three ""serious"" movies he's done, as I have liked or loved all of them, I am talking about the comedies he helps produce. After hitting the ball out of the park first time out with Billy Madison, one of my favorite stupid comedies ever, he has been hit or miss, with a lot of misses. Luckily most often than not, he follows a letdown with a winner. I'm not saying Happy Gilmore was a letdown per se, but it is not one of my favorites of his. However, right after came the 80's pop culture referencing The Wedding Singer. While not the funniest of his films, it balances the sentimentality, the heart, and the laughs better than any of his work. I could truly watch this movie anytime it is on TV; it never gets old.The story is not an original masterpiece as we have Sandler's character falling for a girl who is engaged to a jerk/adulterer. We all know how it will end up, so it is the exposition and the plot progression that needs to work in order to sell us what will ultimately happen. This one hits all its marks flawlessly. Between the crazy scenarios that our main characters end up intertwining themselves in, to the fantastic soundtrack, to the clothing and technological advances of the decade being sprinkled throughout, to the genuinely priceless singing scenes, it all works. The opening wedding helps start everything out on the right foot with a great cover song, a cameo by Steve Buscemi which is hysterical, an introduction to all our main players and where they are in their lives, and many big laughs. Counter this with Sandler's next gig, while depressed beyond belief, and you have two polar opposite situations that deliver the goods with equal success.All the performances work and it is the cameos that sometimes overshadow the leads. Adam Sandler is probably at his best here as far as comedic roles. Unlike his previous efforts, portraying dimwitted goons that speak like they are mentality deficient, here he shows some nuance as a character with fully fleshed out motives. His Robbie Hart is a guy that people can relate to; a nice guy trying to show that sometimes even they can finish first. Drew Barrymore is the weak link as usual. She is brimming with happiness and possesses a cheery disposition, but she just isn't a terribly good actress. For a role like this she is not too bad, especially in parts where she is allowed to just go with it. When Barrymore and Sandler are getting price quotes for wedding photos and pretend to be brother and sister, there is a real moment that almost makes her seem natural. Unfortunately, most times she just looks like she is trying to act and therefore coming off as unnatural and awkward.As said before though, it's the cameos that steal this film. The aforementioned Buscemi is top-notch as usual in Sandler-fare, Jon Lovitzwho generally annoys meis very funny, Billy Idol is classic, Christine Taylor effective, and Allen Covert shows why Sandler puts him in almost all his films. I don't quite know how these two met, but it seems that they are pretty good friends and it comes across on screen. He is the confidant, the ying to his yang, the comic relief, and the voice of reason at some point during the film. It is interesting that he has never had this prominent of a role in a Sandler-vehicle since, because he does a great job with this one.",The Wedding Singer
60,Beta_Gallinger,A funny romantic comedy about a struggle for love,8,10 November 2009,"This romantic comedy was apparently a box office success during its theatrical run in 1998, but I was a little over eleven years old at the time, and the movie was rated PG-13. I clearly remember seeing it advertised at a video store that's long gone now, and seeing the cover of it, featuring a picture of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore (didn't know who they were at the time), and the tagline, ""He's gonna party like it's 1985."" However, I didn't actually watch ""The Wedding Singer"" until 2006, when I saw it on TV, I think just months after it had been adapted to Broadway. It made me laugh the first time, maybe more so than any Adam Sandler movie I had previously seen. A little over three years later, a second viewing didn't hurt.In 1985, Robbie Hart is a failed rock star but a successful wedding singer, living in Ridgefield, New Jersey and singing popular 80's hits with a band at weddings in this town. He meets a waitress named Julia Sullivan, who works at the places where he performs, and befriends her. The singer is engaged to his long-time girlfriend, Linda. Unfortunately, Linda does not show up at their wedding, and later tells Robbie that she has decided she doesn't want to marry a wedding singer. This sends him into depression, and he no longer feels romantic, which negatively affects his performances. Julia is engaged to Glenn Gulia, a rich businessman, and asks Robbie to help her plan the wedding. However, in the process, the local singer learns that Glenn is a cheater, and Robbie and Julia find themselves falling in love with each other.This movie may be a bit more laid back than a number of others starring Sandler, but that doesn't mean it's less funny. It might be funnier than most of his other films! There are so many parts that made me laugh, such as the one with Linda not showing up at the wedding, Linda telling Robbie afterwards why she doesn't want to marry him, the gender bending member of the band, George (based on Boy George), only ever singing ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me"", Robbie singing ""Love Stinks"" at a wedding and the outcome of it, Jon Lovitz playing a rival wedding singer, and too many others to mention! The most hilarious part might be the main character's ""Somebody Kill Me"" song! In addition to a lot of good humour, there are also characters to like. The soundtrack features some good 80's music, though if you have the very popular opinion that the 80's were a terrible decade for music, you would obviously disagree.I didn't like absolutely everything about this 1998 romantic comedy. I'm not sure about my first viewing, but the second time, I found that it went downhill slightly, later on in the film. The romance, while I've certainly seen worse, didn't impress me as much as it could have, at least not towards the end of the film. I don't know, maybe some of it is too chick flick-ish for me. Also, the ending could have been more focused and a little less abrupt. Other than that, however, there's not much for me to complain about. I haven't seen every film Adam Sandler has ever starred in, but have seen a bunch of them, some of which are not very good, but ""The Wedding Singer"" definitely isn't one of those. In fact, judging by the movies I've seen him in, this one could probably easily be considered a highlight of his career.",The Wedding Singer
61,Mister-6,"""Sing""in' Sandler....",7,15 September 1999,"I'm one of the few people in the world who seems blind to Adam Sandler's charms.In just about every movie he's been in, he comes across as a shallow, lazy, shiftless bum whose main purpose in life is to make everyone else's life miserable.The fact that I enjoyed ""The Wedding Singer"" as much as I did has little to do with Sandler, though, and more to do with the milieu.Set long ago and far away in the mythic year 1985, Sandler plays the singer of the title, big hair and all, and finds himself falling for a cute waitress (Barrymore, and who can blame him?), who just happens to be engaged to a skirt-chasing lunkhead and is torn between declaring his love or being a good friend and keeping out of things and....Well, forget the plot.  The big drawing card is the setting of the flashy, materialistic, neon-bright world of the Gimmie Decade, as it is so quaintly called.  There are DeLoreans, Michael Jackson fashions, Miami Vice fashions, Madonna fashions, guys who look like the lead singer in Dead or Alive (an '80s band, you young punk), ""rad"" linguistics...and, of course, the music.Ah, the music!  The last good decade for music this century.  Check out the soundtrack if you think I'm lying.  After the Fire, Kajagoogoo, Culture Club, Berlin - the bands may be gone but the music serves as an open reference point to the decade.  And it's good, too!  Even when Sandler sings, it's not as bad (in humor terms, not musical terms) as to be expected (at least it's not ""Opera Man: The Movie"").Final verdict: good if you're a Sandler fan, better if you're an '80s fan.

But he still manages to throw in a ton of hilarious humor. Sandler's friends Allen Covert and Peter Dante return with Drew Barrymore, Christine Taylor, Billy Idol, and Alexis Arquette in THE WEDDING SINGER, one of the funniest romantic comedies I have ever seen.The best thing about this movie is it's originality. It has never been done before. Many of the smaller cliches have been done before, but not the basic plot. It is very original and is perfect for creating elaborate situations and jokes.

The rest you can guess.The movie takes place in 1985 and is supposed to be about the decade, though as someone who lived through the 1980's and who has attended weddings, I never heard of wedding singers until I saw the title of this movie. Was this a 1980's fad? Funny, I remember Yuppies and those stupid yellow signs to stick into car rear windows but never this. Also, Boy George and Madonna may have been 1980's successes but Huey Lewis And The News, Peter Gabriel, and Phil Collins were bigger and more successful during that time period, and without resorting to gimmickry.The movie did have one real surprise, though.

If I were the type of person who stopped speaking to friends because of their taste in movies, this movie would rank there.  As a satire on the 80's, this is not bad (if the intent is to have those of us who lived through it say, ""That was us?!?"", it suceeded), but the rest of it is bad.

I'm pleased to say however that I was very pleasantly surprised with The Wedding Singer.This film didn't fall into any of the usual traps of Sandler's bad films (over the top characters, toilet humour etc). The character of Robbie was great, just a good guy to root for which is what you need in a romcom. Sandler played him very well, making him a sympathetic character and giving him a huge amount of personality and injecting humour when needed.Drew Barrymore wasn't at her best but it was a good performance and her and Sandler had great chemistry, another key ingredient of a romcom.The plot was pretty entertaining. Like 99% of romcoms it was wildly obvious what was going to happen and how the film would pan out but that didn't stop the journey being fun.

78,bbewnylorac,Great entertainment,8,22 November 2016,"This is probably Adam Sandler's best film. You get the impression he is comfortable in this suburban world, and his character is not a total idiot; more an Everyman who's frustrated by his situation. It's a solid plot about how a wedding singer is engaged to the wrong woman, and who pines for unrealistic stardom, not valuing the great life he already has in his small town. The hairstyles and clothes are suitably bizarre. But for me, as a teenager of the 1980s, the real star is that glorious music. As well as pure pop, there's indie cool (Elvis Costello's Every Day I Write the Book), pounding disco (You Spin Me Round), and traditional Broadway (That's All). It's not pretty, it's not cool, but you marvel at how silly but catchy all those tunes were. I love the scene where Drew Barrymore bops along to David Bowie's strange hit China Girl on her Walkman. I like how this movie is very suburban. It doesn't pretend to be high class or pretty. It pokes fun at ordinary lives but it also celebrates them. There are some weird aspects -- the grandmother character and the Boy George lookalike -- but they are fun. There is never any serious doubt about the film's ending, and although the final scene is very cheesy, it's fun.

82,gpeevers,First Adam Sandler Film I Ever Enjoyed,7,19 March 2019,"Set in 1985 it's the story of a wedding singer (Adam Sandler), who is seeking the stability and security of marriage when he is stood up at the altar. On the other side waitress (Drew Barrymore) who is seeking the same and about to marry the wrong guy.Cute and relatively inoffensive with some nostalgic and very funny reflections on the music and 'culture' of the 1980's. When I first saw this movie upon it's release I went in virtually kicking and screaming after having the misfortune of catching the truly awful Billy Madison on television. But here Sandler is much more restrained than in some of his previous efforts.The two leads come across well enough but they are not really breaking any new ground here and the cameos are well used, in particular Steve Buscemi as a drunken best man. The films strength is largely ins 1980's satiric nods.",The Wedding Singer
83,deepfrieddodo,Safe Bet for Easy Couple Viewing,6,9 September 2020,"A nice easy movie to enjoy, which is helpfully supplemented by the romantic element as the big laughs don't come all that often. It's a film clearly of Sandler's best era, but it doesn't quite hit the mark of some of his more well known films. 80s is certainly the right decade for the film's setting and it fits together nicely, although younger audiences now may be completely blind to many of the references.",The Wedding Singer
84,Quebec_Dragon,Romantic reviewer's repetitive ramblings,9,27 November 2011,"I just saw this after having watched it once long ago, probably back in the VHS days, late nineties. I think it's still incredibly charming and funny today (in 2011). I rarely laugh out in the movies, especially alone, but I did here. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are so likable in their respective lead roles. Weirdly, I think it's because they're shown to be really sweet and compassionate and from them it seems genuine. There's such a good chemistry between those 2 and you can't help, but root for them to somehow get together. Of course, several of the funny bits come from the usual Sandler's losing his temper bits. Lots of humour comes from contrasts or switching between moods (ex.: from nice or sad to angry and back again), especially the time Sandler sings his latest composition. You shouldn't laugh, because the lyrics are so grim, but because of his performance, you can't help yourself. Consider also how hilarious it is when he sings a famous happy song, but does it so desperately.You have an amazing soundtrack full of 80s songs that are thematically right on the spot and often quite amusing (especially that famous Boy George song). I was pleased at how generally good Sandler was with the frequent singing despite his few distinctive funny voice inclinations. From the credits, it's supposed to be him and it sure looks like he's really singing instead of lip-syncing. Lots of enjoyment also comes from seeing the (now) outrageous fashions and coiffures of the 80s, as well as the inappropriate things kids and grandmas will say and do. It's obvious people who were teens or adults in the 80s will get the most of the many references, but I do think younger people will also enjoy this very much for other reasons.The Wedding Singer, despite being a romantic comedy, is not that predictable or conventional if you consider, amongst other things, how both main characters start off in a serious relationship headed for impending marriage. I even found it quite touching a few times, almost shedding a tear near the end. Paraphrasing somewhat the start of the movie, some of us, like me, will likely never ever find true love, but it's nice to keep the illusion alive by watching such a sweet-natured and genuinely funny romantic comedy. The 80s setting is a bonus, but it's the heart and laughs that make it shine. It's also something I could easily see myself watching every few years with equal pleasure.Rating: 9 out of 10 (excellent)",The Wedding Singer
85,MarioB,Very very bad,1,14 May 1999,"This is a very conservative movie, like many Hollywood pictures of the 90's. A lot of clichés about women and marriage. From the beginning, you can see how it will ends. Jokes ain't funny and the actor Sadler is very bad.  Barrymore is charming, but I don't watch movies to see nice girls. I want to see a story, get impressed, see good work from the director. There's nothing like that here. It's sadly very very conservative.",The Wedding Singer
86,Darkest_Rose,Very Funny And Very Cute,8,1 January 2003,"The Wedding Singer is a absolutely hilarious and cute movie.

But when Linda doesn't show up at their wedding, Robbie becomes totally devastated and depressed. One night while singing another lousy wedding song, Robbie falls in love with the beautiful and charming new waitress Julia Sullivan( Drew Barrymore) But bad news again, Julia is about to get married to a total jerk that doesn't care about her and cheats on her whenever he gets the chance too. Now Robbie wants to make Julia realize what a total scumbag her fiance is and make her fall for him. I really enjoyed this movie, Adam Sandler was so cute and funny.

87,Gubby-Allen,This is everything bad about films.,1,5 November 2001,"This is without doubt one of the worst films ever made.Possible spoilers throughout.First of all though, I loved the 80's & the music & still listen to it today.However, oh where do I start? Probably with locking up whoever decided 2 people falling in love should be the basis for a film. Casablanca & Gone With the Wind were doing it 60 years ago. Every way it can happen has now been done to death.Also flogged to death is the idea of finding amusement in a previous era or decade. The 80's mocked the 60's, 90's did the 70's. No doubt in 20 years time when we say ""Remember November 2001""? Will everyone reply ""ha ha ha November 2001 - stop it, you're too funny.""? I hope not. I grew up in the 1980's. Trust me people weren't getting on buses or walking around shops in hysterics at everyone.Just like American Pie, to describe this as a 'comedy' must contravene every trade description law in the book. Please tell me one scene in this that was amusing? With the exception of Sandler mocking table 9 near the start, nothing remotely raise a laugh. I had the misfortune to watch this film on a coach & witnessed other passengers in hysterics at a) a man doing nothing but impersonating Boy George & 2) Sandler singing ""Love Stinks.""Questions. On Stars in their Eyes (a UK talent show where members of the public compete by replicating a famous singer) Do the audience sit their laughing as someone takes off Boy George, Adam Ant or any other 80's singer. No.If I got up in a pub & started singing 'Love Stinks' would that be funny? No. It would be annoying & I'd be thrown out (probably with a bar stool wrapped around me.The reason in both cases are they are not funny because it's not a second rate American comic doing it.I genuinely sat there after 20 minutes & thought 'something else must happen. Please don't make the plot as banal as these 2 getting it on. I like Drew Barrymore too. I've never seen Sandler in anything else, but would be more than willing to watch another one. Hopefully it won't be as bad as this.Another idea older than the hills. Someone drunk ruining a best man speech. Please.I would happily buy the CD of this if I saw it (or if it exists) as I love the music. So what I don't want is to constantly hear the first 20 seconds of one good song after another only for it to cut out just at the start of the chorus. Someone should issue a restraining order that songs stay 500 yards away from films at all times, if this is what happens.I've come to the conclusion that apart from 1)Naked Gun/Airplane type films 2)The Simpsons & 3)Will Smith, Americans are incapable of exporting anything funny outside of their own country.Leave comedies with a romantic plot to the writers of Four Weddings & a Funeral & Notting Hill as they show you how it should be done and are in a different league to this crap. This films only gets a 1/10 as their isn't a '0' on the scale.By all means rent this film out. But when you do, watch the first 5 minutes, go away, and come back for the last 5 minutes. You'll follow everything that has gone on.",The Wedding Singer
88,lib-4,Romantic comedy that passes muster,7,17 November 1998,"Whoever would have thought that Adam Sandler could be both a romantic and a comedic star at the same time.  I thought this was a light but nice movie because Sandler was so nice to some of the people at the weddings.  Of course the theme of boy loses girl and gets a better girl is overdone, but it fits here because Julia is as nice as singer boy.  The music is great and I laughed really hard at Love Stinks and the song her wrote and sang to Julia.",The Wedding Singer

It's just that Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are made to star in this movie.Add to the mix a heavy dose of 80's pop culture and the film changes from romantic comedy to a beautiful one. The settings shown are lush, brightly colored and cheerfully happy. The songs are anthemic, uplifting and memorable. The overall effect is a cheery, happy film that contrasts *a lot* with the darker 90s.If you ever had a ""Relax"" tank-top or a ""Choose Life"" T-shirt, this is the film for you.",The Wedding Singer

I know how it sounds just a stupid comedy with a little romance but this is much more then that. It is frigin hilarious.

This movie has Sandler being quite the comic human that he is - the comedy as he goes through a breakup and then chases after Barrymore is true and not contrived. The comedy does not depend on gags or slapstick to achieve its humour; Sandler alone can carry this movie off, that's how good he is in this.

It's still one of the greatest, albeit oft-played, films Adam Sandler has ever been in.Unlike most Adam Sandler movies, he doesn't have to rely on his character being goofy. The rest of the cast does that well enough... that's part of the appeal of this movie.The main reason I can honestly say why people like this movie (especially me) is because it has humor and an element of romance as well... let's also not forget that this was set in 1985; that gives the cast an excuse to dress like a flashback.The best part about the movie is that it wasn't inconclusive, negative or too sexually driven.I totally recommend this movie.10/10",The Wedding Singer

Boy George's with a fetish for ""Do You Really Want To Hurt Me"" never fails to make the viewers laugh.

I got a real kick out of Christine Taylor's Madonna-wanna-be character, Holly, and the Boy George-like George played by Alexis Arquette, and who could forget that rapping Grandmother?  That was the bomb!  Believe it or not, I began to cry happy tears when Robbie sang to Julia on the airplane!  I thought that was so sweet!  Also you can also look for cameo's by 80's rock sensation, Billy Idol (singer of songs like ""White Wedding"" and ""Dancing With Myself"")!

It may have all the standard romantic comedy clichés, but they are far from annoying, and as clichés sometimes do, help us to enjoy and understand the story better. I also think this is Adam Sandler's best movie, along with Billy Madison. The film is sweet, but there are still plenty of tinges of Adam Sandlerness, which can be good or bad (sometimes his comedy is just too stupid), but in this case it is great, and he proves he can balance himself out between comedy and romance. I also have to give it to Frank Coraci since this is only his second film.I guess I didn't mention the entire thing revolves around the 80s...the music, the style, everything. That definitely makes the movie even more enjoyable.",The Wedding Singer
105,n-mo,"Like a kiddie ride at the county fair: somewhat fun, but comes up short of a ""thrill""",6,13 June 2019,"This movie is a rather obvious product of a washed-up 30-something nostalgic for the glory days of late high school/early college. Given the pace and pop culture of everyday life in 1998's America wasn't yet all that different from what it had been in 1985 (though consumer purchases were more frequent and bigger-ticket and the music scene a bit drowsier thirteen years on), there wasn't much room to do anything imaginative with the film's setting, which allows for at most some funky hairdos and a few references to the specific pop entertainment acts of the time, not all of which hit the mark.(On the other hand, Alexis Arquette as an obsessed perennial Boy George LARPer was perhaps an appropriate touch - well, about as ""appropriate"" as one can get in a movie destined for cinemas planted in single-family-unit-dominated neighborhoods - for paying tribute to an era. My, how the times have changed! Nowadays any movie which portrayed androgynous behavior as anything but supremely normal would never make the censors today. The Catholic Legion of Decency in Golden-era Hollywood clearly had different priorities from those of the thought police of our day, but I don't think they were ever anywhere near as hammer-fisted.)So the treatment needed to be put on hold for another 15 years, at least, but it also needed a more imaginative writer. The plot is a completely formulaic and predictable mishmash of love triangles and early-adulthood angst. Unable to really milk its still-green period's idiosyncracies, the film appeals for humor to the lowest common denominator of the time of release (although, this would quickly be relegated to the ranks of the much tamer after the following year unleashed upon the world the likes of 'American Pie' and 'Austin Powers: the Spy Who Shagged Me').However, all is not in vain. The main characters are for the most part fun and charming. Drew Barrymore and Christine Taylor ooze charm and sweetness as the cheery waitress heroine and her free-wheeling cousin, while Adam Sandler proves he can convincingly portray a ""normal"" boy-next-door lead. Matthew Glave as the self-inflated fiancé isn't given much but has fun making his character as loathsome as possible; the female variant by Angela Featherstone is equally delightful to hate, probably the brightest spot in the movie, to be honest. Too bad you can count her minutes on screen on your hands.Overall, worth your time if you want some light fare and really cannot think of anything else to watch. The musical nostalgia aspect has aged well enough, even though with hindsight the soundtrack didn't necessarily incorporate the songs or artists with the most enduring legacies (and some of the best ones they DID include didn't make either of the accompanying soundtracks). Still, I wouldn't mind seeing a more thoughtful 80s-set romantic comedy with a bit spicier period music, sharper idiosyncratic references and a bit of commentary on the period contrasts (mostly in favor of that period against ours, but those who know my sociopolitical leanings won't be surprised I tend to think the past was better). I think such a piece would be pretty marketable. Hollywood, you listening?",The Wedding Singer
106,R_O_U_S,SO much better than The Wedding Planner,9,21 January 2004,"This one should raise a few eyebrows.  The one film I've seen that justifies Adam Sandler's existence (Ok, I raised the occasional chuckle at Happy Gilmore), the joy of this film is the way it revels in the 1980s.  As I have a huge soft spot for the films of that era, I play right into this film's hands.  Pleasingly, the 80s theme doesn't rest on references to Rubik cubes, Dallas etc - it is also mirrored in the film's structure, which is every inch a cheesy eighties romantic comedy, down to the air-bound finale.  Oh, and Billy Joel shows up at the end for a genius cameo.  Yes, there's a rapping granny in it.  But sometimes bad gimmicks happen to good movies.",The Wedding Singer

The plot is VERY transparent from the moment we first watch Sandler and Barrymore together! And we have two MAJOR bad guys here, one male and one female and they are supposed to marry the leads against better judgement. So why watch something that you have seen before over and over again. Just because it's a sweet and painless experience, clocking in just over 90 minutes, so you won't be bored. You might however be slightly annoyed at Adam Sandler, even if he is better here than he usually is, but then you should focus and attention to Drew Barrymore who has a capacity to breath fresh air and life into almost anything. She is so appealing and natural that you won't be able to understand why Sandler has to hesitate at all!!! Admittedly, there are flaws. I could not figure out why Alexis Arquette's character ever needed to be in this picture. He is somewhat of a Boy George-clone, and they could have done something interesting with him and HE DOESN'T BARELY SAY A LINE! And even if the finale is sweet, it is also just a little bit silly.

As we go back to the 80's, it was like a flashback in time. The hair the clothes and the music. This was the first movie Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler did together.

Adam Sandler really paid back for his poor role in Happy Gilmore,he is much more fresh here,Drew Barrymore is brilliant also,all other casts were great too.

110,poem,My favorite of 1998 - simply genial,10,12 February 1999,"This is IMHO the best film of the year 1998. I've seen it five times in cinema (during the 2 or 3 weeks it was running). Every scene is very carefully, if not to say genially designed, the film is filled up with wonderful situation jokes (old woman sings rap, a boy-george-like man which weeps because the marriage of his friends is stopped in the last minute, and very very much like that). Drew Barrymore didn't acted like a toy (as she has looked like often before), but like an admirable beautiful young woman here.The shortest way to describe the movie would be 'Titanic without the disaster' (or with a happy end). The evil rich man which wants to own the girl, the unknown artist which falls in love to the girl, the girl not knowing for a while who of these two she should marry, and the 'historical' environment (even if the eighties are no so far away than the Titanic disaster) - all remembers of Titanic. And even if Adam Sandler surely isn't as handsome as Leonardo DiCaprio (while Drew and Kate are both true beauties), he and Drew acted in the same juvenile, sympathetical, congenial way as Leo and Kate. So there are many analogies between these two movies, while the Wedding Singer is, for me, the better one, with less action but more creativity and fun, more focus on interesting characters and, last not least, the far better music.",The Wedding Singer

I love the story, and Adam Sandler's character. I also think Drew Barrymore's character Julia is just so cute.I only recently realised that ""George"" is played by Patricia Arquette's sister Alexis, but I guess that's just another reason to love the character - the Arquettes are fabulous!In short, I believe this movie is made of pure genius.

Does Julia marry Glenn, despite having feelings for Robbie?An Adam Sandler movie that's a classic? Believe it, I love this movie, because no movie encapsulates the mood of 1980's America like the Wedding Singer, the music, the clothes, the big hair, even the TV shows. It really is a sweet love story about a nice guy who believes in love, and gets his heart broken, trying to find love again. Is it predictable? Sure it is, but every romantic comedy is predictable. Half the fun of a good romantic comedy is the journey, and this is one funny ride.Adam Sandler's never made a movie before or since, that's made use of both his musical and comedic talents the way this one did. He sings some songs that he wrote, one funny, one sweet, and it really makes the part of a struggling singer more believable when the audience hears Sandler sing. Drew Barrymore's never been more appealing, sweet, vulnerable, her face filled with joy and angst at the same time. She was undeniably cute in this film, and her chemistry with Sandler was undeniable too, they tried to re-kindle that chemistry in the awful ""50 First Dates"" but it didn't work, proving that chemistry is a tricky thing and not just in science class. This is a movie with some standout cameos as well. Steve Buscemi is very funny as the bitter brother of one of the grooms. Jon Lovitz is hilarious as Jimmie Moore, a smarmy wedding singer who flirts with Barrymore as he sings ""Ladies Night."" 80's punk rocker Billy Idol has a cameo for authenticity.The writing is excellent, Tim Herlihy wrote this movie, and he wrote three of Sandler's funnier movies, this one, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. The Wedding Singer was the best of the three. The length of the film is perfect, a little over 90 minutes, any longer for a comedy, and it starts to drag. Finally, if you want to know what the music was like in 1980's America watch this movie, it has a slice of everything, from Boy George, to the Smiths, to Huey Lewis. The songs definitely set the mood for the movie, a fun love letter to the 1980's.For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpreess.com",The Wedding Singer

Its a romantic comedy.But actually its quite good. It does contain too many comedy references to the 1980's but still. The time setting and characters add to the charm.Not a great film but surprisingly quite good. Especially Steve Buscemi's cameo. Its worth a watch next time its on TV. The main downside really is Adam Sandlers poor attempts at acting. But he does do a great cover version of ""You spin me right round"".",The Wedding Singer
122,compi24,"Review Of ""The Wedding Singer""",7,10 March 2012,"""The Wedding Singer"" is a 1998 film starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Frank Coraci directs this romantic comedy about a wedding singer (Sandler) struggling to find true love in a seemingly cruel world. From what I've heard about this film, it's one of Sandler's best movies. IGN actually called it his best, so needless to say I wanted to see it. Is it his best movie? I don't think so, but it's not bad. I found most of this movie to be quite entertaining. The best part of this movie is the fact that if features an almost unbearably charming soundtrack featuring a plethora of 80s classics. I love the 80s, I honestly think they were one of the best decades in American History. It was a time that featured a cultural renaissance, a solid economy, and an overall unique feel and I was glad to see that this movie embraced that period so openly. Adam Sandler is also one of the film's strongest points. I honestly did not think that he could play any other part than the lovable fool (""Waterboy"") or the ill-tempered everyman (""Billy Madison""), but he can. Not saying that those parts are bad, but it's refreshing to see a change of pace every once and a while, and Sandler's performance in this film is one. Some of the jokes are filled with a little too much brown and they seem dated in a few parts, but the film's comedy is generally funny. The script is pretty predictable, but as I said it's too charming to rip apart. Anyway I found that, in the end, ""The Wedding Singer"" was a genuinely entertaining movie that ranks among one of Adam Sandler's best movies.",The Wedding Singer
123,Hairy_Lime,"I would watch drew Barrymore in a bucket of urine - or a movie with Adam Sandler, for that matter",7,19 January 2004,"Well, Wedding Singer is a disposable vehicle, sure, but I have always loved the way Drew Barrymore lights up the screen.  It helps that Adam Sandler is dialed down a notch, and is given a decent script, instead of one confusing the obnoxious with the funny.",The Wedding Singer
124,sutcal,"A good natured, comical romance that's well worth watching",8,13 December 1999,"The Wedding singer is a delightful romantic comedy that showcases Adam Sandler's comic talents.The movie is about the romance that develops between Robbie Hart - The Wedding Singer (Adam Sandler) and Julia Sulivan - the waitress (Drew Barrymore).  Robbie is stood up at the alter by his fiance, who has realised that she just doesn't want to be married to someone who is never going to be ""big and successful"".Meanwhile Julia is having second thoughts about her pending marriage to Glenn Gulia (played by Matthew Glave).  Julia develops a close relationship with Robbie as the movie progresses as the two inevitably fall in love with each other.There are a couple of twists in the movies, which leave us hanging on to the climax (with a nice cameo from Billy Idol).  It's a feel good ending to a feel good movie.The movie is certainly not original in its concept, however Barrymore and Sandler certainly pair up well and lead the viewer with a smile when they finally become a couple.  Adam Sandler shoes a little more diversity to his comic capabilities, this time not playing an absolute moron, but showing that he can act (albeit in a comic way).  Drew Barrymore is very believable as the vulnerable Julia.  Matthew Glave is also impressive in his role.  He certainly plays the ""jerk"" with ease.All in all, I would recommend viewing this movie.  As far as romantic comedies goes, this is certainly one of the better ones I have seen in recent times.  I gave it an 8/10",The Wedding Singer

126,newkidontheblock,The accumulation of my greatest fear and my fondest wish,8,15 November 2009,"So, the Wedding Singer is a new personal favorite of mine after I saw it for the first time this weekend. It followed the typical Adam Sandler film: the main character is introduced, his world comes crashing down around him, he meets a love interest, has a new found purpose in life, misunderstanding between him and love interest, world comes crashing down around him again, he redeems himself somehow, happy ending /Sandler Movie. At the same time, this movie hit a special chord with me. I didn't laugh particularly hard at it (though it was funny) and the acting/writing wasn't all that stellar. Heck, I'm not even a huge fan of 80's music. I did, though, see a lot of parallels between myself and the Robby character, and I think, in some strange way, the movie was a dramatization of my greatest fear (being left at the alter at my wedding by my bride to be) and my fondest wish (finding the special someone).This film had what a lot of other Sandler films lack: heart. There was no shortage of heart in this film. This is a character that tried to make a decent living and tried his best to make the people in his life, whether they were family, friends, or clients, happy. He gave music lessons to old women for meatballs. He looked out for wedding patrons that weren't having a good time. Most of all, though, music was the passion of his life.Of course, though, it wasn't without the usual Sandler film traits: random cameos, people hurting themselves, douche-bag antagonists, and of course, an adorable love interest; but it's still a film worth viewing at least once.",The Wedding Singer

Movie should be a 7, if not for this.",2,2 April 2021,"I could see if Alexis Arquette received nominations for her fabulous performance as 'George', and Christine Taylor's 'Holly', or Angela Featherstone's, 'Linda'. But that Barrymore received award nominations-- that this movie received so many nominations, is beyond comprehension. Barrymore's character, 'Julia' is emotionally, intellectually, and sexually stunted, and grossly so. And there is that every-present lisp, that is correctable - or editable. But isn't. Further typing 'Julia' as emotionally, intellectually, and sexually stunted.I own this movie and watch it when I want to see the tender portrayal of 'Sammy' that is performed by. Allen Covert. Adam Sandler plays his role as 'Robby' just fine. But the viewer cannot escape 'Julia'. Why, when the viewer, at long last, sees 'Julia' wearing clothing that reveals bust, this viewer is repelled as it is as though a bosom was stuck on a child. Otherwise, 'Julia' is wearing clothing that might well be chosen by an emotionally, intellectually, and sexually stunted individual. Viewers are led to think 'Julia' and Glenn.are sexual together, but imaging that union would require envisioning such things as bundle boards.'Julia's hair is that of a preteen in a religious sect that allows shorter hair. Even the pendant that she wears constantly, screams on the screen, and yet, viewers are never told why she wears that modern, heavy piece of jewelry with the housedresses with which she is clothed. Contrast all this with 'Julia's' rapacious, highly-stylish mother. Good grief.",The Wedding Singer

Simply because you really want Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore to get together. They have such wonderful chemistry together. Plus the characters they play are so likable. My respect for Adam Sandler stems from this movie. Not very many male comedians can show enough versatility to do a romantic movie. Plus I love 80's music.  Highly recommend to all.,The Wedding Singer
131,Kreme,Much better than most people give it credit for,8,12 April 2009,"Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have a wonderful chemistry in this movie, and the movie works perfectly as a romantic comedy and a period film.The soundtrack is a pretty much a soundtrack of what must have been Sandler's senior year of high school. Also, the soundtrack is appropriately broad, not focusing on a few bands, or even a particular genre, but rather the mishmash of everything from top-40 to light hard rock that a lot of people in 1985 were listening to.Sure, the movie is predictable in the way that all romantic comedies are, but the getting to the predictable ending is a good ride.",The Wedding Singer
132,Petunia-2,Howling With Laughter!,10,10 October 1999,"Right off the bat, I will tell you I am NOT an Adam Sandler fan but I LOVED him in this movie and even bought the video.Sandler plays Robbie, an engaged man, who is employed as a singer at weddings, bar mitzvahs, parties, etc.  He admits to all that he is ""in love with love"" and has dreamed of getting married since he was young. Unfortunately for Robbie, he is stood up at the altar and must come to terms with his grief.The way in which he does so is hysterically funny.  The best scene in the entire movie is when he sings ""Love Stinks.""  I will not give this scene away for those who have not yet seen this movie but the scene is a GEM.  If I want to put anyone in a good mood, all I need do is pop in this video, rewind to the beginning of the Love Stinks scene and play it.  My brother laughed so hard, he was heard by my neighbors down the street!  And inevitably, when guests view the scene, they ask to borrow the video.  My tape has been on loan to friends and family for over 2 months.Enter Julia (Drew Barrymore) to help Robbie with his woes.  The late Barrymore acting clan must be shining down on Drew with pride.  She definitely has inherited their acting genes.  In Wedding Singer, she convincingly plays a demure waitress; in Batman Forever, a sexy vixen; in Ever After, an abused young woman.  Here's another former child actor who has graduated to adult roles with ease, following in the footsteps of Kurt Russell and Jodie Foster.And watch for Robbie's singing student--a sweet little old lady who steals every scene she's in!I am now sorry I did not see this in the theater, but I didn't believe I could relate to the 80's as that was a period when I got married and was starting to raise children.  I was wrong. It was fun to relive the 80's and to remember little things, like different fashion crazes (people dressing like Madonna and Michael Jackson), that Boy George was a big deal back then, and especially the music (Police, etc.). The soundtrack is great.A truly entertaining film that my whole family (8 years and up) could watch and enjoy.",The Wedding Singer

135,SilkTork,Romantic Comedy,5,23 September 2004,"The Wedding Singer is a romantic comedy set in the 80's. It's the familiar boy meets girl story. The boy in this case being a singer at weddings. He's smoothly smooth, and just a little too nice to believe. He meets the girl when she starts waitressing at the same weddings in which he is booked to sing. But they are both engaged to other people so nothing is going to happen. Then the boy gets stood up for his own wedding. He is told by his ex-fiancé that he's too boring (and, boy, is she right about that!). The boy becomes depressed and listens to too much of The Cure. But there's now an interesting edge to him at least. The story then unfolds in typical romantic comedy style. The gimmick here is all the 80's references. Amusing at first, you need to have a big capacity for overkill to continue to laugh at that gag. The lack of originality. The same idea repeated over and over again until you want to scream. Yes. It certainly does capture the essence of the 80's! It's an enjoyable enough little film.

137,grange85,"Enjoyable, despite everything",7,13 June 2000,"The eighties were a musical and cultural low, so setting a film within that era is a hazardous, some would say foolish, exercise. Somehow, however, The Wedding Singer manages to overcome the problems of a dreadful soundtrack, awful clothes, and a truly cringe-making cameo from Billy Idol, and provide a largely enjoyable couple of hours. The main reason for this is the excellent performance of the two leads, Sandler does pathos and bitterness in an appealing and yet un-sugary manner, and Barrymore is equally adept at naive and insecure. Together they manage to portray a couple whose destiny is obvious to everyone but themselves, in a very convincing manner.A couple of quite hilarious scenes (particularly the table full of losers), a couple of nice supporting performances and on the whole a pleasurable if not exceptional film. 7/10",The Wedding Singer

It seems that the Americans truly adore men that portray overgrown kids and act like idiots for 90 minutes. With the exception of, for instance, ´There is something about Mary´ I have yet to laugh once while watching these exercises in psychological torture. But...I actually liked the Wedding Singer. I don´t know how, but Adam Sandler managed to make this film funny and even lovable. I suppose it is the simple fact that he plays an ordinary guy and the jokes aren´t of the usual ´man-falls-on-womans-breasts´ kind. I have no idea why, but I actually would give this 6/10.

Well, if you like your films sugar frosted and insubstantial, this film is for you. Unfortunatly, if you are that sort of film buff that needs to see something witty, something new, something clever in order to be entertained, this flick will leave you very disappointed. Sandler delivers most of his lines with the inflection of a comatose Keanu Reeves. Typical of most roles offered women, Barrymore has little to work with - and in turn offers little to the role. Isn't there a law about movies with characters who have funny names? A paint-by-numbers plot, coupled with cheap, heavy handed digs at the 80's, make this one of the most forgettable romantic comedies in recent years, and that's saying a lot. So, what else is there to watch? Well, if I may be so bold, why not rent Woody Allen's MANHATTAN. Filmed almost 20 years before THE WEDDING SINGER, it is sincere, warm, romantic, intelligent and the one thing that THE WEDDING SINGER wanted to be most of all - funny.

I was very pleasantly surprised! I thought it was very funny and the references to the 80's were hilarious. I graduated from college in '84 so I could really appreciate it. They had the hair, the clothes, the pop-culture references all down pat. The music was great also! Glenn, Julia's fiance, was a perfect parody of guys I knew in the 80's who were bitten by the ""Miami Vice"" bug. It was hilarious when the door to his car opened and the theme from ""Miami Vice"" burst out. He was such a pig, you knew she wouldn't end up with him. Christine Taylor's character, Holly, was a dead ringer for some girls I went to college with also. Her wardrobe was perfect! Drew Barrymore was a doll as Julia and I never thought Adam Sandler could play anything besides a numbskull (although he's funny at that too). They made a very cute couple and I am a sucker for happy endings. I am embarrassed to say the little song he sang to her at the end brought tears to my eyes! All in all, a very enjoyable way to pass time. I think this is Adam Sandler's best effort to date. And a bit of trivia--did anyone notice that the girl who played Linda, the one who left Robbie (Adam) at the altar, was the same girl who played Chloe (the hot chick from the Xerox place, as she was referred to), who Ross slept with when he and Rachel ""were on a break"" on Friends?",The Wedding Singer
143,mrkramer,"Sweet, very funny film",9,30 January 2001,"This is a very cute, warm romantic comedy that breaks out of the ""chick flick"" category. It's somewhat predictable, which I normally think is the kiss of death for a film, but that's completely overcome by its genuine warmth and humor. Also, it doesn't take itself seriously, and the occasional overacting and fun mugging for the camera works well within the context of the film. In some ways, it's like the underrated 1994 comedy with Mike Myers ""So I Married an Axe Murderer."" And it's about eight million times better than big budget romantic comedy vehicles like the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan flicks. I don't generally like Adam Sandler films because they seem to operate on a twelve-year-old boy level, but this one was worth seeing. There are good cameos from character actor Steve Buscemi and others such as Billy Idol. Those who have been to tacky weddings, suffered a humiliating, incredibly painful romantic break-up or grew up in the 80s will relate.

144,mikestollov,Adam Sandler can actually act????? WOW!,5,9 September 2002,"A slight, romantic comedy that didn't provide too many laughs for me, but was OK in it's own way.What stands out in this early Adam Sandler offering is that Sandler actually acts. It's not anything deep & meaningful, but he actually plays someone who isn't exactly like Adam Sandler (unlike the atrocious rubbish he's churned out ever since).The story is predictable, it's been seen a thousand times before. Let's face it, apart from a few cosmetic alterations, this is a well worn path. Girl meets boy, boy is rich. Girl loves boy... or does she? Girl meets underdog, who's not rich but is ""wholesome"" or some other trite excuse. Girl falls in love with second boy, first boy beats up second boy & so so & so on, blah blah blah.You just know that Sandler's character will end up in bed with a girl, just by chance, & that Barrymore will call round at that particular moment to declare her love only to be greeted by a semi dressed blonde or something.............. YAWN, isn't anything in Hollywood original these days?True it is funny to see a retrospective on the early 1980s, with one wedding present consisting of a $700 CD player, the gift bearer having to actually explain what a CD is! The hairstyles (including the ""Flock of Seagulls"" reference) plus the music & clothes are all pretty well done, without being overdone. But the joke wears pretty thin after a while, even given the appearance of Billy Idol & the whole film sags under the burden of a plot line scraped from the very bottom of the barrel.Finally I must say that I do think that this is the best Adam Sandler film I've ever seen............ which wouldn't be difficult given the absolute rubbish he's made the rest of the time.",The Wedding Singer

I say somewhat because the movie is cheesy yet adorable. I even bought the soundtrack for this movie a couple of years ago because the music in it is great.. (If you like 80's music.)

146,Cherubin,Radical !,8,28 June 2001,"""The Wedding Singer"" is one of my all time favorite movies. It is not technically brilliant by any means and one would be hard pressed to find a film studies class that would treat it as an example of serious filmmaking but somehow, it jusdt touches my heart. As a child of the 80s, I fondly remember fluorescent colors and people being crazy over TV cop shows and celebrities with homoerotic images. Although my memories may be clouded by the fact that I was in elementary school back then and therefore attribute a sense of magic to the time that really wasn´t there, I seriously think that the 80s were a rather romantic decade by today´s standards. New wave music gave us some of the best love songs ever written, the sexual revolution was officially declared to be dead in favor of committment, and many American movies of the time celebrated romantic ideals (not just love but also heroism) in a way that made people feel enchanted (for lack of a better word). Therefore, the U.S. of the 1980s is a great setting for a sappy, traditional love story like ""The Wedding Singer"". Essentially, the movie is a wish fulfilment fantasy in which the prototypes of the virtuous underdog protagonist, the cruel antagonist, and the likable female love interest are clearly defined. However, the talented cast make it work. Adam Sandler is funny and likable as the protagonist. Drew Barrymore is surprisingly likable here too (as the love interest) in spite of the fact that she played quite obnoxious women in other movies. Together, they seem to genuinely create the atmosphere of a couple slowly falling in love. And of course, the actor who plays Glenn (the antagonist) is just like any genuine self centered jerk any of us ever encountered. In addition to this, a wide variety of odd characters provide plenty of very funny moments - especially Steve Buscemi as an obnoxious wedding guest and Billy Idol as himself. To be sure, the movie has its flaws like the ""butt grabbing "" scene that falls flat and the fact that it seems that the movie was made on a shoestring budget without anything by way of meticulous planning. However, it , at the very least, achieves the status of a romantic comedy which is both funny and romantic. This is not exactly typical for the genre so it may be something of a feat.",The Wedding Singer
147,PseudoFritz,The Ups and Downs of Love,9,31 August 2004,"To repeat a theme, I'm not a big fan of Adam Sandler, but I love this movie.Robbie Hart is a genuinely likable character; he's a person I would like to have as a friend, and he's a performer I would gladly hire to sing at my OWN wedding (Sandler also seems completely comfortable with his character, while even Drew Barrymore sometimes sounds like she's merely reciting written dialogue). Yes, he's a capital-R Romantic, but that seems like a strong qualification for someone who makes his living at other people's weddings. I like the whole idea of a romantic comedy being set behind the scenes of the whole wedding game, and some of the most telling scenes involve Robbie guiding Julia through the preparations with an insider's eye.Probably the funniest parts of the movie (to me) are those that play to Robbie's broken heart; it's probably the best depiction of the depression of the newly-dumped I've ever seen (in particular, I love the ""Kill Me Please"" song). Hey, I've been there.This all being said, however, I think the touch-all-the-landmarks-of-the-mid-'80s approach gets awfully heavy-handed at times. The musical choices, though, were excellent.",The Wedding Singer

The Wedding Singer, I think, is his best so far, though some may think Happy Gilmore is. From the opening scene with Steve Buscemi (another legend ) until the end with Billy Idol I didn't stop laughing. Drew Barrymore gave another knockout performance - I have been a huge fan of hers since ET and it is great to see her doing so well !! Honestly, Drew is probably the best actress in Hollywood. Allan Covert as Sammy and Alexes Arquette as George gave strong performances as well.

150,halnexus,**** (Out of four),8,9 November 2000,"""Some guys have all the luck/ Some guys have all the fame/ Some guys get all the breaks/ Some guys do nothing but complain."" --Rod StewartAh,the 80s.  The decade of Reaganomics, Iran Contra, the Challenger explosion, and the emergence of AIDS.  Yet Adam Sandler maintains in this movie that it was also a decade of innocence, of New Wave rebellion, of exotic pastel colors that were intentionally garish, and of Wall Street brokers who, at least if not the epitome of Republican sleaze, were the antithesis of all things romantic.  It certainly is a vast generalization of an entire decade, yet in an era where ""over-the-top"" was not part of the national vernacular, I'm tempted to agree.""The Wedding Singer"" takes place in a New Jersey suburb in the dog days of summer 1985.  It chronicles the relationship of a nuptials entertainer (Sandler) and a waitress (Drew Barrymore) who serves at his ceremonies. Sandler is engaged to the quintessential Bananarama-inspired dress fiend and Barrymore has an ineffable low-life businessman for a beau.  Together they figure out, through the course of the movie, how right they are for each other.Movies like ""The Wedding Singer"" should not be judged by storyline alone. Nor should they be analyzed through such dire necessities as screenplay, set design (although the movie's is fabulous), cinematography, or out-and-out ""acting"".  The film is a nostalgia piece, an ""American Graffiti"" for the 80s child, and while those cynics out there (paging Roger Ebert) are tempted to dismiss it as another hodgepodge of geriatric love cliches, those who grew up and fell in love with life during this era will most likely smile when the John Hughes-esque villain gets his comeuppance, or when the ""unattractive"" teenager gets to dance with the beautiful girl, or when a pre-wedding montage is set to Hall and Oates' ""You Make My Dreams Come True"".I was a small little ball of wonder during the 80s, and indeed the terms ""cocaine"", ""narcissistic"" and ""Nirvana"" were inutterably foreign to me. Yes, I wrote letters to Punky Brewster, I danced to such trendy acts as Nu Shooz, and I went to a Midwestern drive-in where silly sci-fi's like ""Lifeforce"" played while the speakers blared Stacy Q songs during intermission.  ""Childhood"" would be one way to describe it; another would be ""magic"".""The Wedding Singer"" placed me into that state of mind, so much so that I felt depressed after reality hit me with a swift uppercrust as I slogged out of the theater after seeing this the first time.  Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore were nothing but a gawky high-school nerd and a drug-addicted child starlet during the ""real"" 80s, yet they retained a love for the decade that shows up in this movie.  The 80s may have been garish and embarrassing for some, yet it remained primarily the last decade where America functioned as a whole, rather than being split down the middle with ""independent"" subgenres in the worlds of politics, film and music.  The spirit of the times reflected a ""one last bash"" attitude, where established songwriters like Rod Stewart produced their fluffiest hits.  Some call it ""selling out""; I call it having fun.  ""The Wedding Singer"" takes a snapshot of the suburban innocence of an era, where cynicism had yet to filter into the middle class. Girls just wanted to have fun, computer geeks had yet to make their millions, and boys had a crush on either Molly Ringwald or Ally Sheedy. Ebert asks if the screenwriters ever stopped to think about the plot of this movie; no they didn't, Roger.  That would have brought in all of the unpleasantries of the decade.  For those of us far away from it all, ""The Wedding Singer"" is how we twenty-somethings like to remember our childhood: sweet, beautiful and substantial.",The Wedding Singer

154,misslv80,"Light-hearted, cute, romantic, very funny - party like it's 1985, baby!",10,15 April 2004,"""The Wedding Singer"" is a movie that surprised me very much. I did not see it in the theater when it was originally released because 1. The trailer did not present anything to me to make me want to go see it and 2. I am not a fan of either Adam Sandler or Drew Barrymore. But it turns out this is one of my favorite movies of all time.Sandler plays Robbie Hart, a struggling wedding singer who falls in love with Barrymore, a waitress who works at the weddings he plays gigs at. She's engaged to a Wall Street broker named Glenn, played very smarmily and very well by Matthew Glave. Unfortunately, Robbie's fiance Linda dumps him at the wedding, and it all takes off from there. Barrymore is cute and charming as Julia, and Sandler as Robbie is very entertaining and funny. Both have great chemistry together as romantic leads.I always crack up at certain scenes like when Robbie goes back to work at a wedding gig and completely destroys it after being dumped at the altar, or the scene when Julia is talking to her cousin Holly about wearing the engagement ring Glenn gave her for three years and feeling like an idiot and the cook responds by saying, ""Relax, don't do it!"" Ha ha ha! The supporting characters such as Robbie's best friend Sammy, the womanizing limo driver, Rosie, the old woman who pays Robbie in meatballs for singing lessons, George, Robbie's back-up singer who aspires to be like Boy George, and Holly, Julia's Madonna-wannabe cousin are all great and very likeable.Sometimes you just want a movie to make you feel good, nothing very deep, but it makes you laugh and you can have a good time watching it. The movie gently mocks the 80s, but never in a mean-spirited way. The soundtrack is killer. If you loved the 80s and want a good trip back in time, this one's for you. Plus, Billy Idol, Steve Buscemi, and Jon Lovitz all make cameo appearances! Recommended highly to all.",The Wedding Singer
155,Amigard,"Music is great, plot sucks",7,2 October 1998,"The movie jumps off with one of the best songs of the 80's (Dead or alive's You spin me round), and that made me think that this could be great stuff. But while the film passes on it is more a standard romantic comedy. Placing it in 1985 is too much overdone and way to cliche. Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights (1997) is a good example of how to make an exact copy of a certain time, but in this picture it is too much repeated ""Hey, we're in the 80's now"", and that's why it's not right. What really blew the movie is that Drew Barrymore (really bad this time) and Adam Sandler get to marry each other. After a few minutes you could predict that. Why is there a rule for a romantic comedy calling ""in the end there has to be a mariage""? Is living together not good enough anymore? No more marriages please or I can't stand romantic comedy's anymore.",The Wedding Singer

157,lilcutie18613,"Awww, the 80's :)",10,27 July 2005,"Adam Sandler plays Robbie Hart, a wedding singer with only enough money to get by.

Drew Barrymore plays Julia Sullivan, a shy girl engaged to the wrong man. They meet when Julia is waitressing at the place Robbie works at. They are instantly friends and get along quite well.This simple plot is expanded by the great and memorable characters and the actors who portray the roles. It is funny and has plenty of memorable lines.

158,brainybrailler,Sandler's best,10,25 March 2006,"I remember catching glimpses of ads for this, introducing the 2 protagonists, Robbie (Adam Sandler) and Julia (Drew Barrymore), stating ""and they're getting married - but not to each other"". I assumed it was going to be another movie about a nasty love triangle where the 1 engaged love interest is torn, as is a married 2nd 1. I was pleasantly surprised. It turned out to be a blast from the 1st scene, a delightful one where wedding singer Robbie Hart is introduced singing ""You Spin Me Round"" enthusiastically enough to get every person to dance and enjoy the whole thing. I'd love to have him at my wedding. After finishing singing/shooting out jokes, zingers, and compliments, he saves the groom humiliation from his jealous drunken brother (Steve Buscemi in 1 of his funnier acts), and a drunk boy embarrassment, while meeting waitress Julia Sullivan. While he's euphoric over his approaching marriage, she despairs that her boyfriend of 4 years who proposed 2 years ago has yet to announce when their big day will be. The 2 agree that if her wedding occurs, Robbie will sing since Julia is scheduled to waitress at his. Unfortunely, his wedding is cut short when Linda (Angela Featherstone) is a no-show and, when we actually see her meeting him shortly later, tells him that the problems of his being poor, no longer a famous rock artist, and living with his in-laws have snuck up on her. While he becomes depressed over everything from his life to his job, Julia's fortune also does a 180: Glenn (Matthew Glave) sets the date. When Robbie's friends and family tactlessly advise him to go back to work to stop him moping in bed, he barely makes it through singing, and after being criticized by her father for hollowly congratulating the groom for the bride's presence, turns to insulting guests and singing (better) ""Love Stinks"", & gets kicked out. Julia is the only 1 who encourages and sympathizes w/him, even when he says he can't consider doing his now hated job for her. ""They eat prime rib, and I sing. It's a joke"" he says. A few weeks later he seems to be having an easier time, since he goes to Julia and Glenn's engagement party with player buddy Sammy, and sings at bar mitzvahs if not weddings. Still, he's reluctant to help Julia when she requests his advice on wedding plans, since everyone she knows including Glenn is unable. As he does, he begins to fall in love with her despite his denials, and attempts to go out with her player cousin Holly (Christine Taylor). When he and Glenn get a moment alone and begin to discuss beautiful women, he learns that Glenn is only marrying Julia, whom he considers trustworthy since she loved him before he became rich, so they won't break up - and doesn't really love her enough to talk about, either. Now he has to figure out how to tell Julia he loves her more than Glenn does. This is Sandler's masterpiece. I think my reason for saying that is, unlike Big Daddy, Billy Madison, or Happy Gilmore, his character here is neither foul nor self-centered and lazy. True, he does shout when Linda and a bride's father criticize him, and his causing a stir at that wedding is a Sandler-like quality, but for most of it we see him as a good-natured people person. Even his missing the mark when Linda describes how he used to be a rock band lead singer wearing certain clothes by replying that he'll wear them seems more like a reactant to shock rather than stupidity; and he probably blows his opportunity for a banker's job with bizarre honesty because he's too nervous to think of a lie that'd get him accepted. I find it a bit odd that Robbie doesn't care about $ at all - he lives beneath his sister's family and prefers to be paid for music lessons in meatballs, but it's even odder when Julia, trying to convince him not to act like he has a sudden liking of it, says he doesn't want to be another yuppie - doesn't she find it odd that he hardly seems aware of $, even if that's preferable? The thing I never understand and probably never will is why he's always wanted to be married and start a family of his own since his parents' death when he was a kid. I don't think it was too realistic for Linda to realize 6 years after Robbie left his failed career that he was no longer a rock artist, or to ""learn to deal with"" it 3 months later; that Robbie loved her so much though she wasn't particularly attractive and he admitted later to being blind to her numerous personality flaws; or for Sammy and Holly to begin looking interested in one another near the end since they seemed to know each other and ignored each other for most of the movie. Still, this is a great movie. There's plenty of funny parts, such as unexpected dialogue of an elderly woman Robbie teaches and an old man he and Sammy meet in a bar. The climactic scene on a plane seemed unrealistic and bizarre (Robbie's story of romance and odd song is well-received by all), but still enjoyable. He looked the part of a wedding singer, and it's great that Adam Sandler could sing! It was great to feel real chemistry between him and Drew Barrymore. I loved the numerous '80s references, and the awesome soundtrack - as well as other music, such as the string version of ""Don't Stop Believin'"" at the backyard wedding.

A, because it's set in the 80s, and I was an 80s teen. The fads, toys, inventions, fashions, music. TOTAL memory flash! B, the soundtrack was totally awesome and had me dancing in my seat! C, It relied on witty remarks and characters' personalities for humor and comedy rather than crude jokes or gross-out/potty humor (I stopped thinking there was something funny about people going to the bathroom when I left the single-digit age group. There are a lot of moviegoers who aren't twelve years old anymore and, therefore, don't find flatulence to be funny). It was funny yet clever and sweet, and the only gross-out moment was the part with the drunk teen, and that was rather brief. D, it really touched on what it is to have a broken heart and was a very realistic look at those suffering through romantic sorrow. E, it gives unpartnered souls hope through the message of ""everybody meets someone"" F, Heads up, David Bowie fans! The Bowie reference in the dance club scene is sure to strike a chord in the hearts of those folks (such as myself) enchanted by the musical stylings of that particular gentleman.

162,dmb1243,THE 80s Nostalgia Trip Of The 90s!,7,6 September 1998,"The spine of this movie is your basic romantic comedy - it's hardly a spoiler - you know the outcome, and its always happy. However, what makes 'The Wedding Singer' so good is its setting. The 80s music really drives this film from good to great. The backing music fits the scene, but it is Sandler's superb renditions of songs such as 'Love Stinks' and 'You Send Me Round' as the wedding singer of the title, Robbie Hart, that make the movie. His acting is fairly similar to what has been seen before in movies such as 'Happy Gilmore', only in a more refined, less slapstick manner. Two of the movie's high points are the two original songs, the delightfully twee 'Grow Old With You' and the hilariously profuse 'Somebody Kill Me', both sung in fitting style (though out of tune) by Sandler. Drew Barrymore is surprisingly sweet in her role as the love interest, Julia. 'The Wedding Singer' is a soundtrack maker's dream come true, as many songs are played or referenced to in its course. The film is also delightful in its references to 80's culture, which make it a very enjoyable movie for everyone, whether they can remember the era or not. One last point - the rendition of 'Rapper's Delight' by Ellen Dow has to be seen to be believed!",The Wedding Singer
163,Fiss,True love the way it's supposed to be.,10,13 January 1999,"The Wedding Singer is an exaggerated, but still true story about true love.  Sandler is hilarious, especially with his emotional outbursts and great subdued comments and jokes.  The rest of the cast compliments him perfectly (The mutants at table nine was a great scene)  Barrymore is an angel in this movie.  Innocent and lovely.  Great acting and emotion put into most of her lines as usual.  Billy Idol makes a cameo, and you can't help but cheer along with him as he helps the leading couple get together. This is NOT a serious movie, but it is wonderfully entertaining, and a good dose of romance to the heart when you need it. Of course, there's the Kiss scene, that won a MTV Movie award.  Drew can be just as sexy being the good girl as she is the bad girl, and she melts the screen, even with Adam, who is hardly a heart-throb to most.  It's great to see a normal, average guy get the girl.  Not all nice guys finish last. :)",The Wedding Singer

It's over the top, but at the same time, it's based on the characters. It's a movie that is made great by having an amazing cast making well written characters come to life, and this is in big part because Sandler and Drew have amazing chemistry.

165,alombardy,Why do I like this movie so much?,7,2 June 2014,"I am not a fan of Adam Sandler. His comedy is usually crude and panders to the lowest common denominator of cinema-goer. So why do I tolerate, nay enjoy his performance in this movie?I think it's because this was one of his earlier efforts and as such he didn't have as much creative control as he does over the tripe he makes now. The comedy is family friendly but actually genuinely good for the most part, the romance is just about on the scale of believable, and the soundtrack is upbeat and fits the tone.Part of the success of this movie for me is the fact that it's a 90s movie about the 80s, which we don't see very often. The result is the innocent naiveté of the 90s mixed with the elaborate, flamboyant extravagance of the preceding decade and it's a winning combination. It culminates in just a general 'feel-good' vibe that thrives in the midst of safe but quality comedy and a cheesy, predictable yet satisfying narrative.Billy Idol's cameo is a highlight and fairly veteran actors such as Steve Buscemi turn in surprisingly adept comic performances alongside Sandler and Drew Barrymore as the romantic leads. The shame, of course, is that people will form an opinion of this move when they see Sandler's face on the front and it may well turn them away from a corny yet very good comedy worth seeing. 7/10.",The Wedding Singer

The film was good but perhaps not as brilliant as some of the other comments have suggested. The soundtrack stayed away from many of the real 80s howlers. The best moments had to be the audition with the dude singing Ladies Night stretching ""sophisticated mama"" to new dimensions and even better the reference to the Sugarhill Gang's Rappers Delight when the old woman has a go at rapping the intro; this was inspired stuff as it brought in a link with the first ever hiphop record at the beginning of the 80s.",The Wedding Singer

Now they take it so seriously, which makes you groan ""Oh come on"".  Adam Sandler mumbles a lot, there are some very one-dimensional characterizations, some vaguely interesting characters whose roles go absolutely nowhere, and a plot that you can peg in the first 5-10 minutes of the film.

But The Wedding Singer shows that he has a talent for romantic comedy. Who knew? His character is likable and smart (unlike his other films). Also, the uncredited cameos from Steve Buscemi and Jon Lovitz, and the credited one from Billy Idol, are hilarious.The main downside was the constant stream of references to 80s bands, pop culture trends and politics. Come on, we get the idea already. My wife and I were married in August 1985 also, and I found several of the references inaccurate (for example, I knew a number of people with CD players and large CD collections in 1985--I found it unlikely that characters would be totally unfamiliar with the technology).",The Wedding Singer

Best Sandler movie ever.",The Wedding Singer
180,Moonlyn,Funny Singer!,10,4 August 2005,"This quirky film has everything- lots and lots of comedy, a nice touch of romance, some violence and a hint of sadness now and again. Oh and it also stars 2 of the most charming actors- Drew Barrymore, as Julia and Adam Sandler, as Robbie. Their on-screen chemistry is very remarkable to watch and their individual charm is most appealing. The movie is set in the 80's and is a great nostalgic piece for that time period- in all is cheesiness and glory! Sandler as the Wedding Singer will surprise you with his musical talents. And musicians who have run the gamut of various music-related jobs will have extra giggles. And of course Barrymore will dazzle you with her cuteness and poise. This movie will leave you in stitches! And a must see!!!",The Wedding Singer
181,minerva-11,The most repugnant and insulting of all romantic comedies.,1,22 July 1999,"The premise for this offensive movie is romance and comedy, both of which it seriously lacks. The film somehow became a sleeper-hit probably due to the number of children who went to see it. Why children? Because they find juvenile smut funny and weren't around during the '80s. It is difficult to comprehend how America, usually so obsessed with political correctness, could over-look this film's immense offensiveness and vulgarity, together with its ritual degradation of people who are over- weight or short. We saw this film at a bargain basement price, but we are still reeling from the waste of money.",The Wedding Singer
182,eshy76,You've got to love those 80's,7,28 January 2000,"I love this movie. It's funny, it's endearing and it just makes you feel really good!! Don't expect a comedy classic or moving love story. This film is just triumphantly...nice. Sandler turns in a great performance as the Wedding Singer himself. None of that being-completely-stupid-to-get-cheap-laughs stuff here. The humour comes from the storyline and the setting (a completely believable rendition of 1985). It's not clever in any way - utterly predictable right from the start, but the cheesy humour and mushiness will win you over. Barrymore is perfect and the on-screen chemistry with Sandler is spot on. There are, admittedly one or two annoying bits, gags which don't quite come off - Billy Idol's cameo comes to mind, but overall if you want a feel good romantic comedy...look no further...",The Wedding Singer
183,MAJORIC,Wonderful novie that Fizzles!,8,5 April 2006,"Mr. Sandler has done it again. Such an incredible entertaining movie that show great movie, but he still lacks enough control to make it through. His past five movies suffered from a hurried, tacked-on ending and this one is no different. The final scene, though lovable and making the Internet message boards buzz on how they loved it, conveys the feeling Mr. Sandler really didn't know how to end the film in a coherent way related to the rest of the movie. Too sweet for such a cynical endeavor. The highlights? Wonderful mid-movie song: ""Somebody kill me, please."" Excellent eighties atmosphere. It sent me back through time.",The Wedding Singer
184,roxygirlblue01,My Response to this excellent Movie. But this comment can really I've away the story,10,27 November 2006,"this movie stole my heart. Robby and Julia made the perfect couple; two sweet lovebirds, just looking for love just happened to find each other, and at last second, before fate took Julia, Robby turned her frown upside down. Who better to help Julia than the well known Wedding singer of the town. This is the ultimate love story. Clean and sweat to the spirit. It's an uplifting movie than people can't afford to miss. Because there are plenty of love movies, but this is not just another love story. It is the most unique love story I have seen. It is so sweet that you can't even compare it to candy. But you can certainly compare it to the sweet taste and feeling of wedding cake!All of the characters really contributed to the story. How it seems so obvious that Robby and Linda were really not meant for each other, and that Julia and Robby are a perfect match! Also How everyone around them contribute to the natural attitude of the main characters. For example, the friends that a person hangs out with can really affect the person's attitude and decisions. That can clearly be seen in this film. Plus I love movies that have the setting of back then. I still even listen to David Bowie. Now its just my opinion, but there was a great choice of music in this movie.Notice how the characters are lighted during the film. The light comes from the back, and the lighting also sparkles the eyes to add the sweetness of the movie. I love this movie and I would strongly recommend this movie to girls 12 and up. I hope you love this movie as much as I did!!!",The Wedding Singer
185,clare_bear25,great romantic comedy with awesome music!,8,21 March 2007,"i love this movie!! before i watched it i was like ""this will be just another romantic comedy with a happy ending..."". well it was a romantic comedy with a happy ending but a really good one!Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore light up the screen and work really well together. Adam is his usual funny self but also charming in a way. his singing wasn't bad either. Drew was radiant in a really natural way and she looked great. The whole cast was great, especially Rosie,(the hilarious old lady). The movie was really well scripted too, and i believe it has been turned into a Broadway musical, which would be amazing to seeI loved the fact that it was set in 1985. Being born just after the 80s ended, i found it really interesting. They used lots of really cool songs from the 80s as well, and i would love to get the soundtrack.good comedy, good cast, good story and good music all make this movie totally worth seeing.",The Wedding Singer
186,SidelinePictures,The Wedding Singer Sings The Perfect Note,8,23 August 2007,"'The Wedding Singer' is an Adam Sandler classic, hands down, and an all around great movie. With its all '80s soundtrack, this hilarious comedy is an all out laugh riot. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler show fantastic chemistry on screen, creating a loving vibe that is always enjoyable to the viewer. Robbie Hart is the 'man with the mic in his hand', and he rocks out with the 'then in-style' mullet.This humorous movie is very well-written, acted, directed, and dressed up, eighties style, making this film thankfully memorable. It will bring time travel you back to the eighties. Which is a good thing, because of the film's precision soundtrack, outfits, nightclubs, and speech. It truly is tons of fun. 'The Wedding Singer' is totally worth seeing over and over. 'I want to grow old with this movie.'",The Wedding Singer
187,bahamutwing,Simple love story,8,20 August 2015,"I found very little original about this film. What it did it did it well. Worth a watch, it's very sweet.At the time of release this film was not praised by critics but it was tolerated. Drew Berrymore as Julia was cute as a very cute thing. Adam Sandler was passive as that loser with very little talent but still ends up with the girl. The music was nicely done. For some time now media uses the same set of songs to define the 80's. This film defined it's own playlist.I think it's also important t on note that Adam Sandler plays a real person in this movie.",The Wedding Singer
188,rudedude-1,A great look back that should have had us looking forward.,8,24 September 2007,"Robbie Hart (Adam Sandler) is a wedding singer who is dumped by his fiancée. He is brought back from the abyss by a new waitress named Julia (Drew Barrymore) who is busy planning her own wedding. This movie is a nostalgia trip for me because I grew up in the 80s and I remember most of the gags and in-jokes of this movie ($700 dollars for a CD player; someone not wanting his ex to have his Van Halen t-shirt because he's afraid she'll jinx the band into breaking up). I also went to school for a few years in the town that this movie was set in so of course more memories. However the thing that I just realized after re watching it this morning is that no one realized that Adam Sandler had what it took to be a great leading man. In 1998 he had made three other movies before The Wedding Singer: Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Bulletproof. All three of these showcased his comedic talents but The Wedding Singer brought out a whole other side of Sandler that no one knew existed. Even after this picture it took several years before people would see this. The movie that truly showcased this was Spanglish However it was seven years between the two films. Imagine what he would have made if the right people had seen the Wedding Singer back in 1998. To anyone who appreciated Adam Sandler in Spanglish and Reign On Me check out the Wedding Singer. You'll be pleasantly surprised.",The Wedding Singer
189,DiscoLando,Adam Sandlers actually demonstrates multi-dimensional acting abilities!,9,2 March 2000,"This is the first Sandler movie I've seen where he actually demonstrates acting skills! It is just as funny as his other works, but I can actually stand to watch this more than twice. His other films lose their punch after watching them more than twice, but The Wedding Singer has enough depth to enjoy multiple times.",The Wedding Singer
190,jimc1215,Enjoyable throughout!,10,1 December 2000,This is a cut above Adam Sandler's other goofy movies.  He and Drew Barrymore have great chemistry. She is totally charming.  And what a delightful ending!  I could watch this movie every night and be entertained by the music alone.,The Wedding Singer
191,i_love_it,"Not perfect, but still absolutely excellent, and the best ending EVER!",10,2 August 2002,"Strictly, I don't go for really cheesy films, but this one's so offbeat that it makes my list of all-time favourite films.  Every time I see it, I forget how funny and romantic it is, and how good I feel inside when they get together.  Bit sad... stupid...?  Yes, maybe, but I totally love this movie. Adam Sandler is fantastic - so sweet, but also hilariously (makes-you-feel) sympathetic when he gets mad at his ex-fiance in the song he shows Julia. The ending is just how all films should end.  The soundtrack is irresistable, and Sandler's singing very good and truly gorgeous.  Drew Barrymore is so sweet and beautiful, and still remains my favourite female actress.  You have to see it to love it! (obviously)",The Wedding Singer
192,iSpeakFilm,A Great Flashback to 1985,10,8 February 2009,"The year 1985 was a great year from the 80s and this movie from 1997 set in the 1980's proved that. From the clothing to the music to that totally radical 80s hair it was totally 80s. Adam Sandler played the part of the wedding singer Robbie Hart, who was supposed to marry Linda who never showed up to the wedding and then later came to Robbie's house and told him she never wanted to marry him. Drew Barrymore who played the part of Julia,who was a waitress who was getting married to a guy she had been with for two years, Glenn Goulia. In the end the two realized they were met to be together and then became Mr. and Mrs. Robbie Hart. A true romantic victory!",The Wedding Singer
193,cindylam1967,One of my favourites,10,10 June 2018,I love this movie and don't mind watching again. It is funny and romantic and witty. I love Adam Sandler's musical talents. I love that he sings and writes songs. I absolutely love the ending of this movie. It is so romantic. Drew and Adam do have such amazing chemistry. They are both very likeable and charming. It was also great to see Billy Idol. I love to listen to the song over and over again. I wish someone would serenade me with that song. It just makes my heart melt. Adam Sandler is one of my favourite comedians but this is about his best movie ever.,The Wedding Singer
194,Gueyome,Adam Sandler,8,16 November 1998,"My favourite Adam Sandler's movie. I don't know why, but it is the one where I laughed the most.  Maybe because in this movie, the character he acts is not too dumb.  The part where he plays ""Somebody kill me"" is hilarious.  And Drew Barrymore is still very cute.",The Wedding Singer
195,Eve-14,"Good, but could be better",9,21 April 1999,"This movie accentuates the heart over materialism as far as love is concerned.  Yet one should look at the character of someone which if they know someone as a friend first, they would  figure out a person's flaws eventually, especially someone like Julia's Don Johnson.  No matter what anyone says, I still think it is important to have someone who can provide for themselves and a future family if that is what would eventually be desired.  No one should have strangers raise their kids.  Studies have shown this to be detrimental to the child-parent relationships.  So as much as I would like to believe in the message of heart over materialism in this movie, I don't.  Yet I will say that the acting is superb.  Love Drew and her ""girl next door"" personality. The 80's nostalgia works in this movie as well.  See it.  And as corny as it is, I do own the video as well.",The Wedding Singer
196,Diedel,Love to the music of the 80's,7,27 September 1999,"Along with the lovestory of this film goes one of the best soundtracks i could imagine for this movie. The music goes great with the happenings on screen, and the turns and twists of the lovestory keeps you well entertainment during the whole movie. Together with some great actors and guest stars this all make a really good film.",The Wedding Singer
197,Math Wiz,"A Funny Movie, But Also A Classic Love Story",4,16 February 2000,"I think this is a perfect movie. It has a lot of Adam Sandler's great humor, but it doesn't have all of the silly, gross humor like most of his other movies do. The love story part of it was excellent. It is classic, 2 people really like each other, even though one doesn't know that the other one likes that person. I would recommend this movie to anyone who asks me for a great Adam Sandler movie. This movie most definitely ranks close to the Waterboy and Billy Madison.",The Wedding Singer
198,StarboyNgirl-04,Drew and Adam = goals!,10,19 October 2019,"Classic, adorable and the sweetest moments on screen. A longtime favorite of mine, where to this day the flight scene still gives me chills and happy tears. The chemistry between Drew and Adam is every couples dream.There are many moments that make Adam just become more and more adorable. The music is enjoyable and those meatballs did look absolutly delicious. Drew will always be America's sweetheart, she brought ""Julia"" to life so preciously.Overall a great feel good movie, ok to watch with the family if your kids are a bit older.

199,johnsimpsonhenley,Great Feel Good Movie,8,1 January 2020,"Adam Sandler is great in this film. It is a feel good movie, just the sort of film to relax with. The plot is very predicable but who cares? The colour grading of the film is bright and saturated and gives an escapist, unreality feeling, a bit like Disney films, just a bit of harmless fun!",The Wedding Singer
200,susiesays,Hilarious movie that brings me back to the 80's!,9,22 September 2002,"I really enjoyed this movie! The movie had a good storyline and it was hilarious. I'm partial to this movie because I grew up in the 80's and it brought me back to the music, fashion and fads! This is a great romantic comedy!",The Wedding Singer
201,Holly_OHara,The Worst film I have ever had to endure,1,17 January 2005,"I watched this film for two reasons: I was told from a variety of quarters that it was great and I have a soft spot for the music and fashions of the decade I grew up in. I cannot put into words just how disappointed I was by the time I had sat through it. The storyline could be predicted by a four year old, with every new 'plot development' leaping in front of the camera like a camera-hungry wannabe long before the script called for it. The jokes, such as I could define them, were also set up with scaffolding just in case the audience might fail to notice them.Yes, some aspects of the 80s are indeed laughable, however, to devise an entire movie around this 'joke' is really scraping the barrel. The Wedding Singer was on TV about a year ago and I wondered if I should give it another try - perhaps I had been too harsh before. But no, in fact, it was worse on the second viewing and I actually found I could not watch another second... it was just too cringeworthy.",The Wedding Singer
202,Hamed,Everybody should see it!,10,15 October 1998,"This is an excellent movie. It had been long since I saw a good movie. The movie is funny and it really touches your feeling. Heck , I wanted to get married after I saw the movie.",The Wedding Singer

204,Robman9000,Pretty bad.,2,3 January 1999,"My friend brought over this movie to watch on DVD and it was absolutely terrible.  The plot constantly repeats itself because it is so thin and all of the '80's references are cheap and very unfunny.  I didn't laugh once during this movie and there wasn't anything worth seeing storywise as it was predictable and unbelievable at the same time.  I can't believe this movie is so popular.I gave it 2 out of 10 for the IMDB vote, I must have been in a good mood.",The Wedding Singer
205,Not_a_bit,Lovely work,8,2 February 2001,"I love this movie because it combines the popular songs of 1980s with the plot in a lovely way.

Also the overall plot is quite solid and enjoyable, so I would comfortably recommend this one to anybody!",The Wedding Singer
206,sitesista,Charming,8,20 January 2003,"This film is really not a thought provoking and poignent tale. It is however extremely heart warming and a total feel-good film.

(Pauses in obvious anguish)... they were cones!3)Exaggeration of every aspect of the eighties for the sake of it. 'I bought you a 'CD' player, it cost me $700, but it has excellent sound quality', and a Rubic's cube; 'no-one will ever solve this thing'!4)I mean won't you miss Miami Vice? No- Summer- repeats.5)Continued foreshadowing of a ridiculous and contrived ending: Woman spontaneously turns around and says 'that's the sweetest thing I've ever heard'! 'You guys have got to help me'!You won't waste any of the 2 hours watching this.",The Wedding Singer
208,daquinofamily,Great Retro Movie,10,25 April 2006,"I thought this was a great movie. Having been a member of a wedding band in the 1980's, it brought back great memories of the music, the fashions and the overall aura of that era. Oh my God, the gaudy wedding gowns the screen brides wore. Back then you just couldn't get enough beads or sequins on a gown. Check out the Miami Vice references. The 1980's was definitely the Me decade. I think this is one of Adam Sandler's best performances in a movie. His character had some depth. He and Drew Barrymore seemed like they had some great on screen chemistry going on too. She is just cute as a button in this role. If you want lighthearted fare and lots of laughs, this movie is for you. I hear it's being made into a Broadway show as well. Wish I still lived in New York to be able to go see it.",The Wedding Singer

It makes you believe in true love, and keeps you laughing all the while!",The Wedding Singer
211,mrfrank,Sweet romance rises above usual Sandler fare.,10,31 March 1999,"When someone was gushing to me about how great Titanic was, how it was a tragic love story, blah blah blah, I countered with this movie. Hey, why not? The characters have flaws, and it wasn't set so far in the past that everything was filtered through rose-colored glasses (get it, rose, ha ha I kill me). Adam Sandler fans don't seem to like this movie much, but I liked it better than all of his previous movies. So much so that I saw it in the theatre eight times. And I'm not a huge Adam Sandler fan (though I liked Happy Gilmore). What made this movie work was its emphasis on the romance.Adam Sandler's lovable loser and Drew Barrymore's down-to-earth waitress are wonderful to watch. It goes through the emotion tugging before the eventual conclusion, but you still feel more for these characters than most would feel for a Jack or Rose. It's nice to see that Robbie isn't trying to get down Julia's pants (unlike his Fonzie-wannabe friend), instead being content with her company. They both seem unsure about their lives, placed at an age where they aren't kids anymore, but aren't quite adults either (despite Holly's comments). It makes all their fumbling around trying to find each other more believable.I haven't seen a movie with cameos this hilarious in a long time. Steve Buscemi, Jon Lovitz and Billy Idol all make the scenes they're in stand out. Most of the rest of the humor in the movie involves making fun of fat people, old people, drunk people, and an assortment of society's losers. It's kind of disarming to see this sweet romance offset by this vile humor. But it works somehow, even though you sometimes laugh at something while thinking ""I shouldn't be laughing at this!"" (Like the fat lady gorging herself on wedding cake) As a satire of the 80s, it works mostly because it doesn't give the glow of nostalgia to everything.When someone asked what my favorite movie of all time was I said this one. I don't really have a favorite, but it's nice to see a movie that doesn't have any pretensions about what it is, a funny romantic-comedy. Oh, and Drew Barrymore looks impossibly cute too.",The Wedding Singer
212,tedwards77,absolutely awful,1,13 February 2002,"I begrudge even giving 2 minutes of my time to this film, it's so bad, but I though I'd warn others. I rarely write reviews, but felt a need to here. There's not a single thing funny about it, not one scene.Its nothing like the 80's and shame on anyone who lived through the 80's who think it is realistic. Its soppy, stupid and a pathetic plot that anyone could guess. Adam Sandler, who is awful in everything mumbled throughout.
The worst thing is people who weren't around in the 80's actually seem to believe it was like this, in the same way they believe Braveheart, Patriot & Titanic had realism in them.The poorest film ever.",The Wedding Singer

WATCH THIS if you believe Adam Sandler is incapable of being funny.",The Wedding Singer
215,Modgirl7,Cute but lots of mistakes,7,1 July 2002,"I have no idea why but I like this movie. There are so many obvious mistakes in it, but the simplicity and sweetness of the story make up for the horrible outfits that Drew Barrymores character, Julia wears. Nothing about her said 1985 to me, the year in which this movie takes place. Robbie's friend, Sammy, wears a jacket identical to what Michael Jackson wore in his Thriller era, and I really think that any guy, (at least over 14) that wore this kind of jacket in 1985 would in no way be cool. And what is with the almost whispered lines? In any scene where Robbie isn't singing his voice is so quiet and low. The acting was terrible, except for Christine Taylor and a few others and Drew Barrymore needs to learn a new accent. Other than these faults I can't help but like this movie.",The Wedding Singer
216,Dan-153,A formulaic disappointment,4,7 December 1998,"This opening 45 minutes of this movie are very entertaining.  They remind you of what an incredibly ugly and embarrassing decade the 1980s was, especially with regard to haircuts and pastel-coloured jackets, and contain a great cameo from Steve Buscemi.  However the moment the plot kicks in you realise you are watching just another substandard ""romantic comedy"" with the usual predictable plot devices based around misunderstandings which are not believable.  The last hour of this movie ceases to be funny and the ending is laughable (rather than funny).  The film makers should have stayed with the funny observations and steered clear of the sub-John Hughes plotline.",The Wedding Singer

There's laughs, tears, and above all Drew Barrymore. What else could you want from a film. The cameos were also great even if Billy Idol is definitely not one of the best actors in the world. I saw it on the big screen and recently on video where it hasn't lost any of it's magic. Adam Sandler is fast becoming a truly great comic actor. 8/10",The Wedding Singer

220,sonata13,This movie floored me,10,4 December 2002,"I'm usually pretty cynical about cheesy movies but this movie absolutely floored me.  Drew Barrymore was phenomenal playing role of Julia Sullivan. I've seen the movie at least 30 times by now and her expressions still make me cry, they're just so sincere. I don't know how else to put it.  As for Adam Sandler I think that this is his best role yet, he's a real person in this movie not just some overgrown immature goofball.  On top of everything it's a brilliant 80s satire, for me its right up there with American Psycho. I understand why someone would have reservations about watching this movie but my advice would be to put your cynicism aside for a couple of hours and just watch with an uncritical mind.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",The Wedding Singer

For anybody who can't get enough of the 80's culture, this movie is for you! Adam Sandler is a man of many talents, as displayed very much in this movie. He can be quirky and funny as hell, and he can also be something else: serious and just plain cool. The chemistry between him and drew Barrymore is something else. They work well together, and i'm actually surprised that they did not date in real life. his friends are funny too,(especially the one wearing the Michael Jackson suit!!)all in all, this movie was just awesome; great direction, awesome 80's culture, and most of all, the performances by Sandler and Barrymore. 10 out of 10!!",The Wedding Singer
223,shawn9210,Not the typical Sandler movie,9,30 April 2004,"The Wedding Singer and Punch Drunk Love standout from typical Sandler movies is two important ways.  1) The humor is subtler in these movies, and Sandler is much more subdued.  2) Critics actually like these two movies.The Wedding Singer is a pretty average romantic story that wins because of funny performances and the ever elusive ""chemistry"" between Sandler and Barrymore.  This was the first movie that taught me what romantic chemistry was.  While you're watching it you not only want the characters Robbie and Julia to get together, but you want Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore to get together.  The chemistry is that strong.  A reason people, especially guys, don't like romance movies is because often the love between the leads seem contrived and forced.  Thankfully, the Wedding Singer steers clear from that, and actually allows you to have an emotional stake in the characters.Sadly, the movie is slightly forgettable, as it merely succeeds in its goals but fails to impress.  However, it's great fun while it lasts and you'll always have a fond, if somewhat faded, memory of the movie.",The Wedding Singer
224,jonesjulia,A heartwarming film,8,28 July 2006,"For those of us who look back fondly at a decade of dodgy hairstyles, gaudy colours and the reign of Michael Jackson and Madonna, this is the perfect film! It has the capacity to induce laughter, tears, boos and cheers. Adam Sandler (Robbie Hart) takes on the unusual role of a sensitive idealist (as opposed to his usual obnoxious but funny and somehow redeeming characters) and Drew Barrymore plays the delightful Julia with the charm that she never fails to bring to the screen.There are hilarious scenes that echo the usual wedding reception capers, with a fantastic and unforgettable performance of a camp Boy George tribute! Although it is entirely predictable it is nevertheless a heartwarming film that serves to remind us that the enduring love and companionship that a marriage is really about is far more important than a glitzy, elaborate wedding.",The Wedding Singer
225,xXsineadXx,A hilarious comedy and a heart-warming romance!!!,8,8 January 2006,"This has to be my all-time favorite,it's just pure brilliance,i've watched it a countless number of times and it gets better and better every time, the dialogue is just hilarious and the slightly predictable ending is just heart-warming!!!Contains an excellent soundtrack and Adam Sandler does an excellent job as Robbie Hart, the singer. A great performance also came from Drew Barrymore as the waitress Julia Sullivan and cousin Holly Sullivan was portrayed well by Christine Taylor. The complete plot of the story is very original and hard to find in any other film which once again adds to the excellence of this classic. This film is definitely in my top five of favorites and in my opinion deserves more recognition and credit for its excellence.",The Wedding Singer
226,kaihau,An ok movie,2,27 September 1998,"The Wedding Singer wasn't great or anything...it's not too funny either.  It has few laughs, not as much as other Adam Sandler movies like Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison but Drew Barrymore was great in this movie and some of you may like Adam's ""nicer"" side.  This movie was a bit dull with not enough laughs but it wasn't a bad movie.  Just an okay movie... you'll like it if you like Drew Barrymore but you would be disappointed if you are an Adam Sandler fan.  You might like it a lot if you like the spoof of the 80's but it was overkill for me because there were just too much of it and only a few worked...",The Wedding Singer

The part where he sings the song that is ""sort of uneven"" is so funny I actually wet my pants. I was really impressed with performances by both Sandler and Barrymore - I knew Adam Sandler could warble but when he sings at the end, he sounds good! All in all, a cult classic to go on the shelf next to Say Anything and Can't Buy Me Love.",The Wedding Singer

229,nevsky,"Finding ""The One""",7,10 January 1999,"As an engaged woman, I appreciated this movie's focus on finding ""the One."" Drew Barrymore's character and her first fiance had DECIDED to get married, simply because her fiance didn't want to end the relationship, and he proved to be a disgusting philanderer who cared little for his future wife.  As Adam Sandler and Barrymore begin to fall for each other, the viewer is reminded that ""the One"" is not necessarily the most logical CHOICE; he/she is chosen by the HEART and not the MIND.  One cannot base love on future income, future profession, future location.  True love can come only from the heart.  I found myself identifying with Barrymore's surprise and joy as she began to fall in love with the man with whom she was meant to spend the rest of her life.  I, too, felt the same surprise and joy when my fiance asked me to marry him, because I have found that love has little to do with logic.  I think many young brides will identify with Barrymore's character.",The Wedding Singer
230,Fred-122,One other thing,9,23 January 1999,"Reading Alex Smith's comments here prompted me to add another thing about this movie that I overlooked first time around.Alex is so right about Drew and everything about her in this film. After 90 minutes she seems just as approachable as the girl next door, and you feel that, as a mere mortal,  you still ""have a chance"".Could anyone say the same about Julia Roberts?I don't think so.",The Wedding Singer
231,Fred-122,Refreshing,9,23 January 1999,"This movie smacks of big box office hype in its promotion but displays much more depth.Nice scripting, a pleasing balance between believable and Hollywood, and at all times you want to like it, and do.Sandler is wonderfully understated and could be a guy you know; Barrymore displays an understanding of the role that suggests she is going to even bigger places.All in all, a good time movie. It leaves you feeling great about life, and we all need movies like that sometimes ... ... As long as they are done well, and this one is.",The Wedding Singer
232,GapKid,The Funniest Movie of the year,10,28 February 1999,I thought this movie was hilarious. It's now one of my favorites. The Wedding Singer was made to look like the 80's which I really liked. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore were sensational. I give this movie a 10.,The Wedding Singer
233,julielou2,"Funny, slushy, enjoyable romance/comedy/music film",7,13 April 2000,"Yes I'm another UK person who hadn't seen Adam Sandler before (or since) but who thoroughly enjoyed this untaxing, light film.  Great '80's scenes and music that made me pine for the olden days where dressing like Madonna was acceptable... nay expected, at school discos, etc.Drew Barrymore who is normally such an unsympathetic character, really is sweet and pretty as Julia, with only a slightly irritating way of clapping her hands together when she is happy or gets her own way.With apologies to his mother and wife, Adam Sandler is not at all physically attractive but Robbie does have puppy dog eyes and a good, kind, caring heart which is so much more important than anything else.We all know what will happen in this film - what counts is how it arrives at it's conclusion.There are very clear cut characters who you will identify immediately. Some sad bits, some frustrating bits but mostly happy parts.Enjoy but don't expect your life to be changed.",The Wedding Singer

It has a little bit of something for everyone...definitely a feel good movie.  It reminds us that good things do happen to good people, but not without overcoming life's obstacles.  Filled with laughter, tears, misunderstanding, and lotsa love, you will be in awe of the chemistry between Drew and Adam.  Two toes up!",The Wedding Singer

But I enjoyed it so much I consider this movie to be one of my all time favorite comedies.  It reminded me of the 1980's (when I got married and a lot of my friends also) Reganomics, The Mini British invasion, Madonna, Boy George, Michael Jackson, Billy Idol, Miami Vice, Delorean's, it was just a simpler time and this film brings it all back.",The Wedding Singer
236,wilson-mclean,Great chick flick for men!!,10,24 July 2006,"Oh come on!!! Even if you hate chick flicks this is a hilarious film that has something for everybody This is a masterclass of Adam Sandler at his best, some might say he is a spent force, some might say he was never funny. I might agree with my first comment but this film pulls on the old heartstrings and makes you want to go visit the mens room because it makes you laugh out loud!!! As much as i hate to hate to say it; i have based my whole philosophy of love on this film and have found the woman of my dreams because of it ( with none of the corny 80's music involved!!!) Laugh out loud funny and a chick flick, what else could you need to impress the possible future Mrs or Mr in you're life?!?? It will go down as an absolute classic in my top 10 films",The Wedding Singer
237,Astraeana,Funny & Sweet,10,27 August 2001,Perfect for those of us who miss the 80s...the music anyway. Adam Sandler is a riot! The movie is great and its worth it just to check out Billy Idol. ;pCheck it out!,The Wedding Singer
238,GollumRox,My favorite,10,4 August 2003,"I usually don't like romantic comedies because it's the same old cheesy plot and ""comedy"" seems to be lack of a better term.  For some reason, I find The Wedding Singer different from all those other films. Reason #1:  It's actually a comedy, whoever I watch it with always ends up laughing eventually...and I mean actual laughter, not a forced chuckle some of us feel we need to get out there to give the film some credit. Reason #2:  The story is original, first of all it takes place in the 80's and is very nostalgic whereas most romantic comedies are set in modern times which makes them all the more reason to be banal.  Also, the plot sparks a different reaction from audiences who are used to the same old thing. And reason #3: Adam Sandler.  Everyone knows him as the immature goofball who can't act only because his previous films have given him that reputation.  The Wedding Singer kind of said ""In your face!"" to critics when he portrayed a sensitive and likeable character without going ""SHUT UP!"" every 10 minutes.  And a film in which Sandler can be ENJOYABLE is something people feel they just gotta see.  And, in my opinion, it is worth the watch. There it is.  You can either take my word for it or just ignore this whole review.  This isn't just my favorite romantic comedy (I don't have a lot of those) but it's also my favorite movie.  So just give it a chance, or else give it another chance.  I don't think you'll regret it...but that's just me.   ****  Once again, that's just me.",The Wedding Singer

I am not a big Adam Sandler fan, he always seems to act the same way in every movie he is in. He crushed that theory with this movie. I should add that I think it's nice to see a lead character who is not necessarily a heart throb. And Drew, who I was never a big fan of is a much better actress than I ever thought. She and Sandler are the next Ryan and Hanks. What a pair! If you are stuck in the eighties (sorta like I am), love eighties music and are looking for a great chic flick . . . rent this one, better yet, buy it. It is so worth it. You will laugh, cry (a little) and at the end know that you didn't waste 90 some minutes watching a movie. Now I can't wait to see 50 Dirst Dates!",The Wedding Singer
241,kkkkkk_madden,Laugh till you cry!,10,4 March 2005,"This movie is the best movie ever made the way he has to deal with George, Linda and everyone else is hilarious!!! Adam Sandler plays Robbie Hart who sings at weddings (hint the title of the film) and he also teaches an old woman to sing at her anniversary, which makes Robbie proud. In nearly every movie the bad guys get the chick, but not in this film but it does take till the end of the film for Robbie to get her!!!

Not once did I appeal to any of the movie, except for when the guy is pushed out of the airplane.It had to be the worst 95 minutes of my life, and the biggest waste of 95 minutes of anyone's time.Nearly five years later, I am still talking about how much I hated this movie.If anyone says this movie rules, they will never be my friend, EVER! How on earth would a director make such a worthless attempt?",The Wedding Singer
243,beersfears247,Hate Adam Sandler? Still watch this movie!,9,20 February 2008,"Perhaps, as a borderline fan of Adam Sandler's, I'm slightly biased, but truthfully, The Wedding Singer is not your common or garden Sandler flick. It's deeply moving, and filled with 80's nuances that make you nostalgic about 20+ years ago. Only this and Click break from the Sandler mold, in my opinion.Robbie Hart, as a character, is not just a shallow character that you can find in some movies. The character is deep, and you can follow him from the good times, through the bad times, and back into the good times, which makes you connect with the character. Julia is a likable character too, and you finish the movie hoping the two of them get together.It was perhaps due to its 80's setting that this movie is so unlike other Sandler movies. While he is the same actor, he holds back on the nuttiness that he uses in his other movies to deliver an almost flawless performance, showing he has a good singing voice to match. Drew Barrymore is a very good leading lady, and the supporting cast do their jobs effectively.If you like comedies - watch this. If you loved the 80's - watch this. If you don't like Adam Sandler movies - watch this.",The Wedding Singer

245,Gweldar,Good fun,10,8 March 1999,"I really liked this movie since it is supposed to take place in 1984, right in the middle of my teen years. Anyone that didn't like the music and styles of the 80's would not like this movie and their comments should be ignored.If, however, you did like the fads and music of the eighties then you should enjoy this movie. This movie was made to make us see how we were back in the infamous 80's. Yes, the story has been done before but Sandler and Barrymore give this movie its charm and humor.This movie will appeal to a certain age bracket more than others because I think it all depends on how you actually liked the 80's. By the way, people that seem to think there were too many 80's references need to wake up and realize that this IS an 80's movie!Don't like the actors in it? Then you will have a jaded opinion about the movie. No one can like every actor or actress but you should not use your dislike of the actor to rule your comments. It is an excellent movie for the genre it is meant to fall into.",The Wedding Singer
246,John-169,Innocence lost,10,30 September 1998,"Although I rate the movie very highly because of the lengths they went to make the two characters (Robbie and Julia) innocent and lovable, they suffered one flaw in character continuity by having Robbie verbally assault a wedding party after he broke up with Linda.  Once you expose a Jekyll and Hyde personality, it is hard to avoid wondering when the next time will occur.  Innocence lost.And to change the subject, has anyone noticed that Allen Covert (Sammy) also appears in most of Adam Sandler's other movies?",The Wedding Singer
247,joelc,A very fun film!,9,28 October 1998,"I really liked The Wedding Singer (9/10). Although it was quite a lot different and probably not as funny as Adam Sandler's previous performances (Bulletproof and Happy Gilmore ring a bell), I still found it very enjoyable. This movie touched me unlike many other romantic movies, and I felt very good at the end of it. It was predictable in parts, just like most movies these days - the scene near the end of the movie when Julia visits Robbie's house and Linda answers the door is a prime example. Both Sandler and Barrymore play very good, convincing roles that engross you in the movie and I would definitely recommend The Wedding Singer as a light comedy to rent to watch with someone you care about. Although I did not live through the 80's I really liked the soundtrack for the movie and I am probably going to go out and buy it (I'm sure some would like to forget this little section of time in their lives).",The Wedding Singer

Adam Sandler is such a cutie when he sings to Drew Barrymore at the end and this is the part that made this movie the best Adam Sandler movie I have seen yet.

253,s6k,A hilarious film yet romantic as well,10,1 June 2001,"The wedding singer is definately underrated in critics reviews. I find it to be a great film, mixing comedy with romance.

Julia is engaged as well, but later, Robbie falls for Julia and discovers that her fiance cheats on her..... There are cameos from Billy Idol and Steve Buscemi, who is hilarious in this film, even if he is only there for about 5 mins. The ending may be inevitable, but it is truly a great film and is one of the modern must-see movies. 96 Mins. approx.",The Wedding Singer
254,summerwind159889,One of the Best Adam Sandler movies.,8,1 November 2008,"The Wedding Singer is just one of those movies where at the end, you truly feel like those 97 minutes of movie you just saw, were 97 minutes well spent. The movie talks about Robbie Hart (played by Sandler), who is struggling with, but loves, his profession as a wedding singer. He loves the idea of marriage, love and the idea of two people who will always be together, forever (This is where you'll probably find a studio audience, going, ""Aw...""). He's the type of wedding singer that, when someone's had a little too much too drink at your wedding or that of a loved one's, you can count on him to smooth things over with a great personality, and with a great set of vocals to match. Sandler seems honest-to-god comfortable with his role, if not absolutely loving every minute of it. Just from the beginning scenes of the movie, you just start falling for this character and sympathizing with his need for companionship. Now, Robbie's troubles start when Linda, his longtime sweetheart and fiancée, leaves him standing at the altar, and he drastically starts to progress into a depressing and somewhat pathetic state. In enters Drew Barrymore, as Julia Sullivan, the shy yet extremely lovely and sweet girl, who is engaged to Glenn, a womanizing narcissist. Slowly but surely, you get the hint that by the end of the movie, Robbie and Julia have to get together. But that's just the beautiful part about it. Whether you enjoy romantic comedies or not, you want them to end up together. One component is the wonderful chemistry that the characters have, another is that of the chemistry of the actors. Even if Drew Barrymore's sometimes timid (which at times looks like bad acting) and sweet demeanor is just.... too sweet and too timid, you have Adam Sandler to yell his throat out with ""Kill me Please"", or charm a smile out of someone. When Sandler is too overbearing with his emotional outbreaks, and pathetic and futile outbursts, you have Barrymore there, ready to pick up his pieces and prevent him from putting a bullet to his head (or worse), with a loving expression and the always reoccurring, ""I liked it.""You would think that movie like this would be absolutely dripping with the sickly sweetness of 90's romantic comedy (Pretty Woman, anyone?), but surprisingly, it's not. You have witty comments everywhere you look, a heart-wrenching breakup and a fresh script that makes you wonder about next week's wedding or if the nerd at the end of reception hall will ever really find true love. Or even if you will. Not to mention the wonderful soundtrack that goes along with the movie. (Who would have thought Adam Sandler was a great singer?)But alas, the Wedding Singer isn't perfect. You're sometimes drowned in the 80's nostalgia, and after that 5 minute high of, ""God, wasn't a great movie?"", you do forget about it in a little while and you don't remember until someone mentions it to you, and you say, ""The Wedding Singer? God, that was such a great movie!""Overall though, it's well worth it, and I for one feel that out of all of the raunchy, sometimes tasteless and dumb train-wrecks Adam Sandler gets himself into, this was one train-wreck that wasn't really so much a wreck, more or so a well conducted pair of trains just passing through town.",The Wedding Singer

When Sandler sings to Barrymore at the end of the film, the way she portrays her reaction makes me feel how she must feel. Sandler portrays some-one in love extremely well, when he's singing to her he looks at her as if she's the only person on the whole plane which just sums up what love is really. This film is romantic, its entertaining, its fun.

Adam Sandlers vocal performances are well done and the emotional chemistry between him and Barrymore is fantastic.Main downside I believe to this movie is a dated objectification humor relating to groping and viewing of people's bodies. It is awkward and uncomfortable and might have passed for humor in the late 90's but doesn't play well today.The musical numbers are fantastic, the characters are fairly one dimensional and the actors all do a stand up job.

Right from the start with the opening song, you spin me round (great cover song by Adam Sandler), which instantly would get an audience watching. The overall theme of the film is Love! With a capital L. The characters were written perfectly, so much so that almost 90% of the movie was comedy. But the main two stars, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymoore showed there acting talents to the fullest. Such emotion was put to these parts, and it shows. So, the classic moments of the film involve the music. Including the songs written by Sandler himself. Most notable must be somebody kill me. Funny, and yet strangely, sweet. The finishing song, i wanna grow old with you, is touching, and enough to bring warmth to anyones heart. Billy Idols appearance was also a major classic in my view.

268,saneful92,Great Comedy Movie!,9,11 July 2016,"I became a big fan of fluffy romantic comedy movie because of Adam Sandler. Spending 90 minutes or so watching a film makes me feel really happy. This movie is one of it. It floored me.Adam Sandler plays Robbie Hart, a wedding singer with only enough money to get by. He was going to get married, but Linda, his fiancé', doesn't show up at their wedding. As for Drew Barrymore, she plays Julia Sullivan, a girl engaged to the rich but wrong man. They meet when Julia is waitressing at the place Robbie works at. They instantly become friends and get along quite well. Their individual charm is appealing. On top of that, I'm totally impressed that they are quite sincere. The air plane ""proposal"" is a sweet highlight. Although this ending is quite predictable, the process of getting there keeps me on the edge of my seat. This movie will leave you in stitches!",The Wedding Singer
269,devinw-73250,"The epitome of ""so bad it's good""",8,16 January 2021,Adam Sandler is a legend at making romantic comedies that are so bad they're good. This movie is so cheesy and dumb but it's so funny at the same time.,The Wedding Singer
270,fourchilddad,My all time favorite,9,30 March 2006,"This is my personal favorite movie of all time. I like just about about every Adam Sandler movie that there is. But the main reason I like this movie so much is the 80's theme. Also, I myself am a big karaoke fan and this has the similarities that go along with that. Also I love 80's music. And romantic comedies are also among my favorites. So this almost has it all for me. The only thing that I would have liked more about it was better music and better comedy. The 80's songs that were selected were not really all the biggest hits. I would have added a Madonna song because of Christine Taylor's character trying to copy her. Also as a comedy film, this isn't as funny as say ""Anger Management"" or ""Billy Madison"". But the sum of the parts equal a great whole.",The Wedding Singer
