0,SnoopyStyle,beautiful pairing in clunky romance,5,4 February 2017,"Rosie Dunne (Lily Collins) and Alex Stewart (Sam Claflin) have been friends since 5 years old. Her life is changing at 30. In flashback starting with her 18th birthday, their relationship is shown as they go on their separate journeys. He loses his virginity to Bethany Williams (Suki Waterhouse) which drives Rosie to self-obsessed Greg (Christian Cooke). Alex goes off to Harvard and finds new girlfriend Sally (Tamsin Egerton). Rosie gets unexpected pregnant from her one awkward night with Greg which derails her plans to study in Boston near Alex.Lily Collins is lovely. Sam Claflin has his boyish charms. This romance could be better. Despite the beautiful pairing, it never really pulls it off completely. It has a fun start. The condom bit is hilarious. There is a way for this relationship to go to develop a great epic romance. It takes odd turns which really throws it off. By the second half, I don't want them to get together. Quite frankly, none of the men are good enough for her. This should really be Rosie's story. Lily Collins is good enough to pull that off.","Love, Rosie"
1,Prismark10,Comfort viewing,5,4 August 2019,"There is a lot to like in Love, Rosie including appealing leads who are wonderfully photographed but this is a sub par Four Weddings and a Funeral.Rosie Dunne (Lily Collins) and Alex Stewart (Sam Claflin) have been childhood friends who are meant to be with each other. However Rosie gets pregnant after a one night stand, Alex goes off to Boston to study at Harvard and she does not want to stand in his way. Eventually Alex gets engaged over there and Rosie marries the father to her child.Throughout the film you just want the two main characters to properly talk to each other to clear up any misunderstandings. Instead the film dreams up further silly contrivances to keep Rosie and Alex from hooking up to each other. So they repeatedly have a dalliance with people who are second best.This is an energetic rom-com, amiable enough to watch but it never rises above average.","Love, Rosie"
2,kosmasp,True Love,7,5 July 2015,"To say this is predictable would be an understatement, but same thing goes for many action movies as far as predictability goes. Actually the fact that two people belong together is so painfully obvious you do wonder how they came up to fill over 100 minutes in here. Looks like a lot of things go wrong ... who'd have thought? Putting a scene from ""now"" at the beginning just to backtrack was a neat idea though.Still some things happen, that might not be as expected. But such is life and the overall impression still says the same. The main actors/characters do their best to keep the tension high and the story going. Even when the script has them do things, they shouldn't be doing. An overall good romantic comedy, fun to watch as a couple","Love, Rosie"
3,sunwarrior13,"Love, Rosie Is More Than Just Another Romantic Film",10,26 June 2015,"Love, Rosie is a romantic comedy and dramatic film based on the 2004 novel Where Rainbows End by Cecelia Ahern.It is a story about lifelong friends who have had countless frustrations and hurdles of having a romantic relationship with each other.It stars Lily Collins and Sam Claflin together with Tamsin Egerton, Suki Waterhouse, Jaime Winstone and Lily Laight.Alex and Rosie have been best friends since their childhood days.They grew up together and shared the highs and lows from being a child until adulthood.They truly felt that there is something more as they definitely have feelings for each other.But they find themselves set into different directions after countless opportunities of being together romantically brought about by the complexities of life like a baby,a marriage,studying in America,having a relationship with another person and missed moments of expressing their feelings for one another.Despite the many changes of their lives,they tried to maintained contact with one another and shared their joy and sorrows of life.Will they find way to end up with each other?This is definitely a charming film.The main characters - Alex and Rosie - are definitely endearing,attractive and full of charisma that the viewer do care for them as they pursue their dreams,careers and one shot at romance.Credit also goes to Lily Collins and Sam Claflin as they gave their all to make characters compelling and interesting enough to make it more than just another predictable,contrived and clichéd romantic movie.It is definitely a joy to watch and entertaining as the audience will definitely feel for both Alex and Rosie from their growth as individuals;to the near misses they have experienced all throughout their lives for love; and when they finally end up with each other at the end.","Love, Rosie"
4,studioAT,Terrible adaptation,1,8 March 2015,"The original source material,'Where Rainbows End' was a very good book and you can see why Hollywood came calling to turn the story of Alex and Rosie through the ages into a film.Sadly they didn't do a good job. At all. The basic plot remains the same but there are so many liberties taken that fans of the book surely must be shaking their heads and going 'where is the story we fell in love with first time around?'. The author says in the DVD interview that she welcomed the changes but what's left is a very by the numbers romantic comedy that verges awkwardly between cliché and dull.The book had charm, it had warmth. This version is rude and sweary to the point where I stopped caring about the characters.The only bright spot (and I really had to search for it) was Lily Collins who captures many of the qualities that made Rosie so endearing in the book.From a very good book comes a very average film. A missed opportunity if ever there was one.","Love, Rosie"
5,neil-476,Predictable but charming,8,25 October 2014,"Rosie and Alex have been best friends since primary school. They nearly got romantic on Rosie's 18th birthday, but Rosie was way too drunk. Since then, both have had relationships, just not with each other - timing has always worked against them.When I watched the trailer for Love, Rosie, I thought ""I now know exactly what will happen in this film."" But I like Lily Collins, so I went to see it anyway. And I was quite right - the story progresses along the tramlines which are displayed in that trailer (with one or two little sidetracks), so don't expect any earth-shattering surprises.But it doesn't matter. Lily Collins and Sam Claflin have an easy chemistry, the film is a romantic drama with some gently amusing moments, the supporting cast is good, and Collins turns out to be able to do a bit of acting, too.I enjoyed this.","Love, Rosie"
6,ferguson-6,Talking beats Texting,5,9 February 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. More Romantic-Drama than Romantic-Comedy, the story spans 12 years – a necessary change of structure from the 45 year saga of Cecilia Ahern's novel and source material ""Where Rainbows End"". It's a familiar theme of boy-girl friendship muddled by quasi-romantic interludes of frustration, confusion, missed signals, and misplaced pride.Rosie (Lily Collins) and Alex (Sam Clafin) have been friends since they were 5 years old, and their bond means they discuss everything from Alex's weird dreams to leaving England together. Well, everything except what they really think of each other. On Rosie's 18th birthday, a poorly executed, drunken spin atop a barstool, leads to the proverbial fork in the romantic road  and off to the dance go Rosie and Alex with other partners. One cringe-inducing condom mishap later and Alex is headed off to school in the U.S., while Rosie stays behind to tend to other responsibilities.In the mode of One Day, or Four Weddings and A Funeral, we track the separate lives of Rosie and Alex. Though connected mostly through texts, the next dozen years bring more than enough opportunity for these two to right a wrong, but predictably bad timing is always their worst enemy. The adapted screenplay from Juliette Towhidi (Calendar Girls) and the direction of Christian Ditter allow us to really understand Rosie and care for her, while the supermodel dalliances of Alex keep him at arm's length.The film's best scenes and most interesting sequences are those centered on Rosie. Lily Collins (Phil's daughter) really steps up her game here and shows some promise for things to come in her career. Most enjoyable are her scenes with the more streetwise Ruby (played by Jaime Winston, daughter of the very cool Ray). The film's weakest moments involve the attempts at slapstick humor. The two worst: a scene involving handcuffs and a headboard and an elementary school; and another scene with the group awkwardly scurrying through an airport. Both seem out of place with the almost pensive nature of so many other moments in the film.In an attempt to lighten the mood and ensure the viewers are on track, numerous songs are utilized and act almost as a narrator for the dramatic turns. Most of these are a bit overbearing rather than serving as a complement to the story. Despite the shortcomings, the message of friendship and dreams is one worth delivering  even if the presentation may be a bit cheesy except for the most hopeless of romantics amongst us.","Love, Rosie"
7,bombersflyup,"Okay, watchable.",4,26 August 2020,"Love Rosie has the characters and fine acting, but a brutal plot.So much unnecessary drama and nothing deep or funny to raise it above mediocrity. A simple phone call could have prevented a lot. The moments where she's with her daughter, handcuffed to the bed etc, that's where it should have stayed.","Love, Rosie"
8,inkblot11,"A Brit, less-lighthearted variation of When Harry Met Sally; sweet, enjoyable",7,16 September 2015,"In London, Rosie (Lily Collins) and Alex (Sam Claflin) have been friends since childhood. Now about to graduate high school, Lily and Alex get drunk at a party and almost kiss, but Rosie passes out first. The moment, if it meant a shift in their friendship, is gone. Soon after, Lily has a one night stand with a jerk, resulting in an untimely pregnancy. Since Alex is off to study in the States, Lily doesn't want to ruin his entrance into the college experience and doesn't tell him she is expecting. But, since the plan was for Lily to go the same school, eventually the secret comes out. What follows in the years after is an off-kilter friendship-romance, with Rosie and Alex never ""free"" of relationships at the same time. Rosie becomes a hotel maid to support her daughter while Alex continues school and lives with two demanding women in a row. Rosie even tries matching up with the father of her child, with disastrous results. If R and A are truly meant to be together, will it not happen until they reach old age? We shall see! This Brit variation on When Harry Met Sally is more serious than this previous work, with far less light-hearted moments. Rosie and Alex endure years of disappointments and terrible partners on the way to true love. As the principal actors, Collins and Claflin are very fine, with the rest of the cast supporting them nicely. The two continent settings are nice, while costumes, a polished script and a sometimes slow but careful direction makes for a film romance fans will enjoy. Therefore, if you are ready for a new trip into the world of sweet love tales, this one is for you, dear viewer.","Love, Rosie"
9,Reno-Rangan,You can't respect the friendship by denying the facts.,8,2 September 2015,"Definitely a modern love story. The movie covers the story of the title character, Rosie's 12 years of life. From the night when she celebrates her 18th birthday till becomes the 30 year old mother. It's a long journey in the real life, and the movie report only the romance side of the life as it is a romantic comedy. Based on the book named 'Where Rainbow Ends', but lots of changes have been done to make a youthfully celebratible movie for the young generation.Usually, the famous romantic dramas are slow, lengthy, and well developed characters. Of course, this one was a romcom, though, much better in many aspect with less emotions and swift pace. About the characters, it was Rosie's perspective and having Alex as a counterpart, the rest are not given much importance other than permits a fair display. Nowadays I kind like Lily Collins, she's cute, maybe it is a crush. But that does not the reason to I like this film, not entirely true. I find it somewhat atypical with many convincing scenes and lines.The story is intensifyingly frustrates us as it takes extreme turns all the time just to make a further riddle and complicate. But that is how the screenplay survives or there won't be any story to tell. It might be Rosie's romance, but you don't have to be a woman/girl to enjoy this film. I don't believe such kind of categorisation, because in the earlier time everyone believed animation is for children only and then it proved wrong. So if a man can watch a movie without damaging his brain, losing his eyesight, or becoming paralysed, then I don't see an issue rather making up everything himself. Hope you all enjoy the movie as I did.7.5/10","Love, Rosie"
10,pennyelenabooks,good enough,4,3 July 2015,"Rosie and Alex have been friends forever and even though there is obviously chemistry between them, they seem to be always missing each other. The main idea for the film is the well known Hollywood recipe for friends wanting to become something more than that, even though Love Rosie is based on a book. The mix up with the real problems of life, the dreams and the failure to follow them, the ordinary family life and the struggles of a single mother mixed up with the romantic life of Rosie and Alex. Lilly Collins is a great actress, but, as Rosie, it just didn't fit. She looked too young to be a mother and a woman who came through so much. She supposed to be aging over the film, and yet she looks exactly like a school girl, even though her co star is transformed from high school student to uni student to grown up. The chemistry between them is there and it is nice to watch them almost getting together, only to be turned apart again, for the first half of the movie, but in the end, it is kind of boring. It is such a long ride, I mean they keep missing each other throughout the whole movie and that felt over stretched. And so I give Lovie Rosie a 4 out of 10.","Love, Rosie"
11,lisafordeay,Very hidden gem with a familiar plot,7,9 June 2021,"Love Rosie is a 2014 romantic comedy starring Sam Claflin(Me Before You) ,Lily Collins (The Blind Side) and Suki Waterhouse. From the novel Where Rainbows End by Insh author Cecila Ahern,the story is about a young woman named Rosie(Collins) who is best friends with a guy named Alex Stewart(Claflin) since they were 5. Although they don't admit they like each other more than friends the two part ways with Rosie becoming a mom to Katie from a one night stand with Greg while Alex gets engaged to another woman.Will the two finally admit that they are more than friends. We have seen this kind of story before from Just Friend's,When Harry Met Sally to even 13 Going On 30. If you are a fan of romantic comedies then do give this one a go.","Love, Rosie"

Who'd blame it?,5,8 May 2019,"Bad timing is the central theme of this Four Weddings and A Funeral wanna-be, which despite several weddings, a funeral and a cliché ridden script, groans with predictable twists and turns as the two protagonists um and err about their future together","Love, Rosie"
14,Seraphion,"Great story about missing-outs, regrets, and irony",7,24 March 2015,"Rosie Dunne and Alex Stewart have been long time best friends. On her eighteenth birthday they kissed even though she was drunk and didn't really remember it. Not remembering they have kissed, Rosie gives a go at Alex asking another girl Bethany to the prom dance while Rosie herself goes with Greg. Rosie and Greg had a one night stand resulting in her getting pregnant, halting her dreams of studying in Boston with Alex. Alex goes on to Boston with Rosie not telling him about the pregnancy. One day Alex asks Rosie to visit him in Boston. Rosie goes there but at the end leaves angrily because she thinks Alex is using her as a distraction from his own life, including his incoming child with his girlfriend Sally. A few years later Greg walks back into Rosie's life and she gives him a chance, so they get married. Alex learns about the marriage but he also separates with Sally due to Sally having an affair.Alex reaches out to Rosie asking if she's happy with Greg, but his mail is intercepted by Greg. One day Bethany, now a successful model, comes to the hotel where Rosie works. When Bethany says she's going to Boston next, Rosie politely mentions that Alex is there. Rosie finds out that Greg is cheating on her so she divorces him. She finds Alex' letter and contacts him, only to find Alex and Bethany are getting married. Her best friend Ruby convinces Rosie that Alex is the right man for her and that she must fight for him. So Rosie, Ruby, Rosie's daughter Katie, and Katie's best friend Toby race to the wedding. They arrive just after the ceremony. In her speech at the party Rosie admits her love to Alex, though she then covers it other words. She leaves when the dance stars. Toby and Katie dance, and he kisses her. Katie runs from Toby and Rosie and Alex give chase. Alex says to Katie that Toby is right for her but she says that it feels strange, just like Rosie and Alex never hook up. Rosie confirms her but Alex reveal the truth about their drunk eighteenth birthday kiss. Rosie goes back home, buys a country house and turns it into a seaside hotel. Alex comes to her saying that Bethany isn't right for him.The story is romance drama with nice hints of comedy. I like how the movie nicely escalates its intensity more and more as it reaches the end. Starting with the finale, the movie then opens with quite a heavy bunch of small comedy giggles here and there, a nice effort in garnering the audience's attention. Then the first conflict sets in, I quite a funny way too, and the movie starts to lessen the comedy intensity and move on with the drama and romance.The drama nicely plays with a heavy dose of irony at both sides of Alex and Rosie. The two characters keep missing out on each other, surrendering to settle in with what's at the table at that time instead of being patient and wait a little while longer. I think the story will really relate to people with similar regrets of letting go the right person for some other person available. What I really like about this movie is that the story nicely completes itself a full circle. The finale confrontation of being truthful about one's regrets and consequences really hits the spot. For me the finale is that good that the movie still feels good even if the ending is a sad one.The comedy, although small in intensity, still kicks out some giggles from me when it happens. The presence of a comic-relieve character in Ruby helps very much in doing so and let the audience anticipate the comedy whenever Ruby comes on screen. The soundtrack also helps in focusing more on the suggested mood, especially on the montages.The acting overall is quite nice. It's nice to see Lily Collins' acting grew from the standard job in The Mortal Instruments. A good thing to note is that she figured out to fix her uni-brows so they don't take our attention LOL. Sam Claflin nicely balances her acting, a better performance than what we see in The Hunger Games movies. My say for this movie is a 7 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and a recommendation to go and see. Who knows maybe this movie can be a thing to take your couple to see and say to him/her to not to repeat Rosie and Alex's mistakes.","Love, Rosie"
15,raulfaust,You oughta know,7,11 March 2015,"Well, ""Love, Rosie"" is a film that I went to see in the cinema without knowing anything about it. But, considering there were a thousand of irritating teenagers right behind me and my friend, in the session, I certainly imagined it would be another silly teen movie. However, it turned out to be something very different. From the get go, I was able to notice how quickly the characters were introduced to us, and how unexpected things were happening all of a sudden. The plot proved to be very brave by demonstrating sex between teenagers and the misuse of condom-- which is even more seldom for an English production. The thing between Rosie and Alex is so usual in real life that it becomes hard to not understand the situations they were getting into. For this reason, I feel right to state that the romantic side of this film is GREAT. Moreover, the comedy aspect of this is just as good, considering there are a lot of moments that I sincerely laughed-- in reality, for such embarrassment I was shown throughout the story. The only thing that bothered me was the manipulative soundtrack; sometimes, director got lazy and dropped an impacting song in order to induce a feeling in the audience, instead of delegating that to the cast. Other than that, in fact, maybe a sadder ending would've made the movie less predictable, but, still, ""Love, Rosie"" is quite eccentric and surprising for ALL audiences.","Love, Rosie"

17,Aktham_Tashtush,"The Plot is proper, with unexpected events,, but there's a lack in comedy.",5,1 March 2015,"good Rom-Com in general, Honestly though, i was always in love with Lily Collins she's a babe .. what a beauty :D ,, The casting was successful.I didn't really see that much of comedy bits in it but still there was some of those ""Aww"" moments like it's nice and cute ..etc.The plot have so much productivity and abundance of ups and downs, there was over 5 to 6 times when you keep expecting that ""okay that's when they're finally gonna get together "" and boom it's not ,, that gave the movie the element of unpredictability !!The story is catchy and Thoughtful, but still rating the movie with a 7.4 looks a bit high :PAgain overall the movie is good but the comedy is so missing... it does get high rated in the UK but in the states i don't think so...","Love, Rosie"
18,MihaiSorinToma,An exaggerated story which lacks emotion,6,28 January 2019,"Rosie and Alex are best friends since they were children, thus they spend plenty of time together and speak about everything. Although they decide to go to Boston together to study, their paths get separated by an accident, event which will influence their lives form there on.It's a movie which tryies to present a love story which apperently isn't meant to be and follows the footsteps of each of the two protagonists as they seek happiness, each using his own approach. The plot seems simple and it mostly is, being a bit predictable and linear most of the time, with a few exceptions. It tries to involve the viewer into its story which should generate plenty of drama and laughter along the way, but as far as I'm concerned, it wasn't able to. It tends to exaggerate in many ways, to present situations which simply aren't necessary or don't bring anything to the outcome. It has a couple of great characters, I have to give it credit for that, but as good as they may be or as well as they are played by their actors, they weren't able to generate enough emotion for the viewer to be able to actually emphasize with them, fact which is quite a shame.It has an annoying way of introducing new elements out of nowhere, generating problems in the same way but also solving them in a blink of an eye. As a result, it's quite hard to believe what's going on and especially the drama that's implied. Another thing worth mentioning here, although you might find it a bit personal and subjective, is the fact that the movie bases its story on a very far fatched intrigue which you either take as it is and try to go with it, or find yourself in my situation in which you find it even harder to take things seriously. I know it's supposed to be a comedy but it wasn't even funny. One or two laughs here and there and that's about it. Even if you treat it as a romance, you won't find a better movie. It would have worked a lot better as a drama, given the fact that it had a better plot on which to build it.As you might have guessed by now, I was left pretty disappointed by this film. It had potential, it had two good actors as protagonists which I enjoy watching regardless of film, but it wasn't able to bring a plot good enough to link it all together. Its superficial intrigue, its predictable nature and its bad habit of bringing and solving issues out of a sudden simply spoils the overall experience.","Love, Rosie"
19,jrarichards,"Quite powerful, if ultimately implausible-looking",7,20 July 2019,"Male as I am, and fan of many different genres of film, I've always - I must confess - had a bit of a thing for old-fashioned love stories, especially where they involve good-looking people, and most of all where there is impossible or unrequited or Romeo/Juliet type love in there. In such circumstances, the heartstrings can genuinely be pulled and full sympathy evoked.But the snag with Christian Ditter's ""Love, Rosie"" is that NOTHING really stood in the way of Alex (Sam Claflin) and Rosie (a beautiful Lily Collins) being together to whatever extent they wished. At least that's so if one discounts two, let's say, tenets of life that may or may not be cliched rubbish. The first is the idea that at some point somebody can become ""more like a brother/sister"" - conceivably true, but you've only got to see the way these two look at each other to realise they are deeply in love. The second issue resembles what we see in - say - the first part of Jane Eyre, where it becomes clear that the friendship and love that the two characters have is MORE perfect than could be contained in any marriage.Perhaps one or both of these factors apply to Alex and Rosie, so one way or another they keep getting hitched to others in ways that prevent them fully being together - even though at no point are they truly apart either. That looks a bit like having your cake and eating it, and is faintly annoying. Also annoying is the apparent pretence that the virtually-all-British cast are not in Ireland and Dublin - as they clearly are, but somewhere in the UK (of course when they are not in Toronto, pretending to be Boston).Anyway, the film offers many pretty scenes, and many (mostly pretty) people, as well as the force-of-nature, irresistible and overhelming beauty of Collins, whose character is also quite gutsy, as neatly set against the overt sexiness (but ultimately lesser attractions) of parts played with less impact by Tamsin Egerton and Suki Waterhouse.But most of this is actually frustrating, because we probably can't actually buy into the factors of various kinds that keep our star-crossed lovers apart. The biggest question of all would of course be whether they could possibly remain unaware of their love for each other? It seems inconceivable. But then maybe this is indeed a symbiosis that goes even beyond love - one that doesn't actually need constant togetherness and marriage?That would be sort-of beautiful were it to be true, but is it?In spite of it all, this IS a film with romantic power and a certain amount to commend it (including a most welcome ""separate"" performance of warmth and quality from Jaime Winstone as Rosie's best (female) friend and co-worker.)But isn't it just a bit daft somewhere down the line? And all the more so as the makers have to jump through some hoops - and shove various characters aside - in order to FINALLY ensure a happy ending.","Love, Rosie"
20,TaylorYee94,Too many accidents,7,9 October 2020,"Chemistry, check. Romance, check. Comedy, check. Good acting, check. However, the story relies too much on accidents. A couple breaks up because of coincidental mistake and makes up with little explanation. You can say that is what all rom-com should be about. However, Rosie's action does not persuade the audience, so it's hard to keep up with her emotions and actions. Rather than feeling it with her, I keep asking myself 'why did she make that decision?' and try to reason with her with some EFFORTS.","Love, Rosie"
21,rooee,"Hate, movie",3,14 November 2014,"Sam Claflin and Lily Collins play Alex and Rosie, whom we watch grow from childhood friends to awkward adults, separated by sea but bound by heart. Bless. No contrivance is left uncontrived to keep them apart. Bad relationships. Babies. Even worse relationships. It's life, Jim, but not as we know it. Fans of the book may be dismayed to learn that the film deviates from the text in the final act – although by then they might actually be glad we're not going the whole hog.Conspicuously boring, the film lifelessly portrays the lives of two remarkably cute yet determinedly unremarkable people who seem to be making a conscious effort to build a semi-tragic love story while leaving a trail of half-loved partners in their wake. It's all building to an inevitable kiss. Unfortunately, a combination of poor editing, and rapid-onset attention deficit syndrome on my part, meant I went through the movie under the misapprehension that Alex and Rosie had already got jiggy at the start, which may have undermined some of the climactic impact.The supporting cast is comprised of pantomime villain boyfriends, poisonously bitchy girlfriends, and an infinitely accommodating pro-life Catholic family. Rosie's best friend is one of those handily not-quite-as-pretty mates (Jaime Winstone) who says things bluntly and whose impossibly simple personal philosophy acts solely to highlight the needless complications of Rosie's own life.This is a ruthlessly formulaic movie in which I lost count of the occasions that Alex or Rosie would come to the conclusion that they love each other, only to discover in the same instant that the other was committed elsewhere. Each dull revelation is followed by empowering montage, propelled by a listless soft rock soundtrack. The early slapstick humour – all baby vomit and lost condoms – is Carry On funny (by which I mean not funny) and gives way to more ""grown-up"" jokes of the blandly observational variety. Nothing that hasn't been noticed by countless Saturday night stand-ups.This is unreal life depicted as a series of poetic coincidences, giving the illusion of fate. It's utterly disingenuous. What, perhaps, wistful 14-year-olds might imagine adult relationships are like. The rest of us are thinking: Get over it. Man up or move on. Somewhere there may be an interesting film to made about the way in which bleeding heart romantics skilfully maintain unconsummated tension over time, but this isn't it.Claflin and Collins are likable leads, and with a decent script and a plausible story they might have showed some chemistry. But it's hard to connect cinematically over text, Skype, and eye-rolling narrative contrivance. I fear that audiences may find it similarly hard to connect with this film.","Love, Rosie"
22,shawneofthedead,"Slight and predictable, but just amiable enough to work.",6,29 October 2014,"Romance novelist Cecilia Ahern made a bit of a splash in chick-lit circles when her second novel, Where Rainbows End, was published in 2004. It was a tale of two people who were clearly perfect for each other but could never seem to find their way towards being in love, told in the form of e-mails, text messages and letters. The story itself was predictable, but the format was reasonably hip and refreshing at the time. Ten years later, the book has been turned into a slight but amiable romantic comedy for the silver screen. The film isn't particularly hip or refreshing, but boasts just enough charm and emotion to entertain - even if it isn't a film that will stay with you for long afterwards.Rosie Dunne (Lily Collins) has been best friends with Alex Stewart (Sam Claflin) since they were kids. They've always meant the world to each other, but have never become more than friends. At their high-school prom, they ask other people to the dance. Alex moves to Boston to begin his studies in medicine, and Rosie must stay behind due to an unexpected pregnancy. Over the next several years, she raises a child on her own, and he gets married. Through all of life's changes and upheavals, they still pop up on each other's radar, connected via e-mails, text messages and a bond that one suspects can never really be broken.That's pretty much it, really - the outcome of the film is never in doubt, however long it might take to get there. Indeed, one problem with Love, Rosie is that it does take a relatively long time to get to the point, even though it's tried to simplify Ahern's novel by merging characters and removing subplots. The longer it goes on, the harder it becomes to buy into the various situations, events and misunderstandings that conspire to keep Alex and Rosie apart - whether it's his marriage or hers, the rekindling of old relationships, or plain ol' geography. Their relationship is so heavily peppered with coincidences and mishaps that it could have made a decent dark melodrama about the dangerous effects of co- dependency.And yet, for all its plot problems, Love, Rosie is a mostly charming affair. There's some real depth to the relationship between Rosie and Alex, one which transcends both friendship and romance in unexpectedly touching ways - whether it's her decision not to ruin his future by telling him about her pregnancy, or the comfort he selflessly gives her when she's struggling to stay afloat in the wake of a family tragedy. Thrown into the mix is the sweet chemistry shared by Collins and Claflin, who are both very cute and very committed to making their roles work. (Collins never feels or looks old enough to play the mother of a teenage girl, even one who had her kid as a teenager, but that's a minor quibble.)Considering how predictable the story is, it's something of a minor miracle that Love, Rosie works at all. But it does, for the most part, whenever it manages to find the heart and humour of its characters and their almost painfully intertwined lives amidst its many narrative contrivances. It's not great art, or even one of the great romantic comedies, but it's a surprisingly decent diversion - one that should please Ahern's fans and perhaps win her a few new ones.","Love, Rosie"
23,troyputland,"Love, Love, Rosie.",7,13 April 2015,"Love, Rosie's leads Lily Collins and Sam Claflin add strength to this adaption that struggles to convert its story from paper to screen. They both hide their love for each other instead of biting the bullet and opening up to each other. They spend 12 years in awkward oblivion (apparently it's longer in the novel). They keeps secrets from each other, Alex's being marriage and Rosie's is pregnancy. Amongst the hardships and the inconceivable privacy are two souls who look and feel normal, never sloping into the ludicrous, always down-to-earth. There is chemistry behind the acting. They push their affections to the front, more so than most rom-com partners pull off. The story doesn't stand-out, the performances do. This is a film to fill up those rainy days and delve into a relationship if only you take the leap.","Love, Rosie"

25,santiagocosme,Idiocy and Cheese combined.,3,3 August 2015,"I know people love to spend an evening watching a romantic comedy just to think of nothing. I must admit, I like that too sometimes, but ""Love, Rosie"" takes things a little too far and ends up in a land where idiocy meets the cheesiest of romances. One scene summarizes perfectly what you will encounter throughout. A girl is in love with a boy, who in return is in love with her. They have been friends for a long time, which seems to be the reason why they can't find the words to declare their love for each other. As a result, they end up going to some high school dance with other partners. Up until here everything seems normal (for a movie), but where it gets bad is when: the girl decides to have sex and lose her virginity with this other young man who seems totally incapable of putting a condom on. He then lasts literally 3 seconds. This disappointing first sexual encounter for the girl is followed by the scare of realizing that the condom fell off and it got stuck inside of her vagina. Not knowing what to do, she runs and calls the man she loves who is still at the dance with his partner. The girl, hysterical in the lift, shouts where the condom is located while another man is right next to her. And surprise surprise, a few weeks later she learns that she is pregnant Now, I understand that it is a movie, and a movie doesn't have to be a pure reflection of what life is like, but this sequence of events seemed so idiotic that I could not tolerate one slip after that, and I found myself repeatedly saying ""Oh come on"" to myself in many scenes. While, I watched the entire movie and in the end I even felt a little touched, I must admit that this movie was far from being my cup of tea. Obviously cinema is a matter of taste, but I would have asked myself serious questions if I considered this flick worthy of my top 500.","Love, Rosie"

All they did was change their hairstyles. Now I'm not expecting wrinkles and sagging but at least some laughter lines or something.Having said all this, the two lead stars, Lily Collins and Sam Claflin, do have chemistry together.Oh and the soundtrack was pretty good, featuring the likes of Lily Allen and Beyoncé, so at least the movie had that going for it!Don't waste your time, I wouldn't watch this movie again.","Love, Rosie"

Not that it opened old wounds but I had that knot in my stomach watching Alex and Rosie being idiots. As movie goes, I guess it means that they've done something right. I was emotionally involved in the movie, I guess we've all been in this kind of mess, and that's probably the reason why Love, Rosie kind of works. The film takes us back to a place where we don't really want to go because no matter how weak the script seem to be - the life span could have been better handled - I still connected with the film.Lily Collins and Sam Claflin have an amazing chemistry on screen, which does not take long to be established in the movie. Their chemistry is there and the audience's history with this kind of complicated relationships is what makes the movie. Collins' performance was better than I expect but she did not look like a mom, not at all, by the end she looked like the Katie's sister. The same goes for Claflin, who blew my mind in The Riot Club, he gave a great performance but he looked the same, it's even hard to believe that time had passed if not for Katie growing up.Love, Rosie is a good film, it's easy to connect to it, a very nice romantic comedy.","Love, Rosie"

Yes it is a romantic comedy so you can probably guess the outcome, but this movie, unlike most RomComs isn't about how it ends, it's about the journey to get there.Collins and Clafin's characters are the best of friends and are in love, the problem is that they don't know it. The two are so focused on using their heads that they don't use their emotions to navigate this tricky path called life. Through thick and thin they have each other's backs and no matter how much they grow to hate each other, they remain the closest of friends.An accurate portrayal of the male/female friendship, 'Love, Rosie' doesn't over-sentimentalize the characters or their own emotional plights, and it keeps you wondering how the film will turn out right to the very end. 7.8/10","Love, Rosie"

34,heyimmyx,Immy's review : One of the best rom-coms,9,30 August 2020,"A charming movie about two best friends concealed love for each other over the years, and the different paths they take in pursuit of their dreams. Love, Rosie is one of my all time favourite rom coms due to its colourful plot, excellent chemistry between the two leads, and it's versatile and well developed characters. It's a delightfully warm and heartfelt film based around our inability to communicate our feelings and always getting the timing wrong, consequently leading Rosie and Alex on a tumultuous 10 year journey of missed opportunities, heartache and regret, whilst each creating a life for themselves that neither of them expected. Sam Claflin and Lily Collins had incredible chemistry and a heartwarming dynamic together, making the film all the more poignant when they ended up with somebody else. It was so lovely how they always found a way back to each other, despite the unflattering circumstances, strongly conveying to us that they were only meant for each other. The film gave us a glimpse of the two characters lives throughout the years and how it contrasted with their dreams ; Rosie raising a child as a single mother thus halting any plans for university, however realises she's happy with what she has even if it isn't part of her plans. And Alex, who despite having the seemingly perfect life and career as he had planned, was blatantly miserable and it is apparent that his success and 'perfect' girlfriend is all a cover up for how he truly feels for Rosie. It's for this reason this film is so much more than just a typical rom com, as it looks in depth at how their lives are remarkably different and how each others absence in their lives impacts their decisions, as despite both seeming happy, there is still something missing. I also love how the movie focuses on the lack of communication and masking how we feel, consequently making both Alex and Rosie see something that's not there and thinking that the other is happy without them, (which is obviously not the case). The soundtrack was vibrant, warm and lively, with every song connecting well with each scene and associated emotion. Lastly, the screenplay was sharp and clever, delivering some laugh out loud worthy lines, as well as the occasional tear or two. Overall, a heartfelt and lovely little movie that is in my opinion severely underrated. Highly recommend!","Love, Rosie"
35,Kicino,"Just take a deep breath and dive in. Whatever will be, will be",8,19 January 2015,"I love Love Rosie. Cried a few times and feel impatient for the characters. It excels in all accounts: plot, script, artistic direction, acting  especially the main actress. The subject matter is nothing new but the way the director handles it is brilliant. Rosie (Lily Collins) and Alex (Sam Claflin) have known each other since they were five and have been good friends ever since. But they seem to believe in a curse that good friends cannot be romantically involved: some men are so dumb; some women are so stupid. Yet as long as we put our mind to it, there is nothing we cannot do. We may meet the wrong person at the right time and disaster follows. We may meet the right person at the wrong time and let opportunity passes. But they meet the right person all the time and are just too timid and insecure to voice their feelings. Thus bad decisions are made – repeatedly - and they have to work harder to make things right. I love Rosie's father adhering to his liberal mentality despite defying his wife's stand. I also like Alex's reference to this bravery. The witty script adds a lot of flavor to the movie and wisely highlights the situation/predicament of the characters. The punchlines often lightens an otherwise depressing situation, or paths ways for an opportunity. Rosie seems to meet a lot of bad luck which turns to good and gradually evolves into trouble. The same applies to Alex. But their friendship and affection for each other remain strong. And that is what is so precious about this movie, and perhaps about our life too for that matter. Despite all the setbacks and mishaps, maybe we should all open our eyes and look around for someone who is already there all along Lily Collins is pretty and lovely. She acts really well just with her eyes and lips. Alex could work a little more on his acting but his eyes and smiles are just gorgeous. Great organization and smooth transition. Very witty script and humorous/light way in treating a subject that could be heavy and sad. Great bodies too! Highly recommended.","Love, Rosie"
36,hooma814,I love Love Rosie,8,16 July 2020,"Seeing this film a few years ago, I was super keen to watch it again. Even second time round it doesn't disappoint. It has to be up there as one of the most frustrating romance stories of a couple trying to get together, but the timing never really working out. It makes you realise how good the timing has been in your own relationships, or maybe not for everyone. But frustration is worth it in the end for a satisfying pay off, seeing Sam Clafin walk in the hotel you can't help but be ecstatic! This movie feels very real in that it moves quickly - not as quickly as the book where they don't get together for way longer. But the fact the Rosie has a kid, they move cities, move jobs all seems quite realistic. Where as other romance movies often take the approach of everything working out within a year or less. This movie confronts its characters with problem after problem and they are constantly faced with coming up with solutions. Many of which don't work. This is something that the audience can always relate to, because we all have problems and things don't work out. There's excellent chemistry between Sam and Lily, they were cast very well and this has to easily be one of my favourite romance movies!","Love, Rosie"

OK yes predictable but who cares. It was a great British movie with good actors, and great scenery, a bit of England, America, sad bits, laughter bits, omg i nearly wet myself at the beginning and the condom it was so funny and sort of sad at the same time. To bring the guy in from the lift at the end was priceless lol. One of my favorite movies and I will watch it again. I think people expect way too much of movies just enjoy it for what it is, a bit of escapism. At least it wasn't full of sex and violence.","Love, Rosie"
38,YJLcool,"A heartfelt, sincere romantic drama comedy film",7,11 November 2014,"Based on the 2004 romance novel 'Where Rainbows End' written by Cecilia Ahern, Love, Rosie is about a story of two people who were best friends since they were young. They've known each other for so long and they're absolutely meant for each other, but could never have the courage to admit that they have strong feelings for each other. Furthermore, life is not always how we expect or want it to be, as various unforeseen circumstances or misunderstandings continuously keeps them apart from each other.Love, Rosie have the same typical flaws that many romantic drama comedies have: several unavoidable clichés and contrivances, a predictable ending. However, as in all romantic comedies, it's the whole journey that truly matters. The film takes the audience through the ups and downs of their relationships and how it affects their friendship over the years. Things didn't happen the way you expected them to be on some occasions, which is rather surprising and refreshing at the same time. The film is filled with occasionally nice witty jokes and heartwarming moments, combine with charming, likable performances from the lead characters. The two leads have great chemistry on screen and it gives the believable feeling that they've known each other for years.There's a real genuine, non-manipulative, non-domineering relationship between the leads as we witness several loving, selfless acts on both sides when tragedy strikes one of them. However, I have to admit that there's a rather unrealistic depiction about this ""friendship"" - men and women can't be close friends because the sex part always gets in the way (A famous quote from another romantic comedy film, When Harry Meets Sally...). In reality, it's virtually impossible that a beautiful, attractive young lady can be close friends with a strikingly handsome man without hardly any sexual tension at all, especially when both of them are heterosexuals and they've never think of each other as siblings either.Overall, the film succeeds in finding the heart and soul for its characters for the audience to relate with, despite its shortcomings. It's a lovely, heartfelt film that doesn't disappoint and it's well worth a watch. Rating: 7.5/10 http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/11/movie-review-love-rosie.html","Love, Rosie"

Of course they get divorces because of affairs and having completely opposite personalities and turbulent relationships. What REALLY got me is that the mother and teenage daughter could be best friends because they look so close in age.

The pink-haired best friend was definitely my favorite.","Love, Rosie"
41,quiqueperezsoler,Missed opportunity,7,27 September 2019,"Many people recommended me this movie as they know I have a soft spot for romcoms as I am quite the romantic myself. But I gotta say, regardless of whether it's trully taken out of the book, this story doesn't know what it wants. It keeps having all this ""based-in-real-life"" events dealing with like unwanted pregnancy or friends unable to express their true feelings until it's too late (especially this one, holy s**t does it take them A LOT of mistakes to realise they just wouldn't be happy until they did), which would have been totally fine but it drags from ""chance"" so much that it becomes some sort of destiny we new since minute one. The way this friends with sexual tension goes is they are friends until they realise they have made just ""some"" mistakes but not like have baby, move in with a girlfriend who he knocks out just to find out he's not the father but now it's too late because Rosie is married.... I mean, unless you want to emotionally destroy the audience who just wants a happy ending between those two but making them go through so much ""baggage"". I'm not a strong catholic or anything but come on, 2 broken weddings in a movie, 2 babies, careers and dreams of young people ruined, the men that are not Alex are all pigs...It's okay if you use the whole ""life pulls them apart and in the end by chance they find themselves in a similar situation so they get together"" but man, this story goes on forever. The main protagonist barely age even though Rosie had, IN THE MOVIE, a baby that grew up to a teenager which it's like almost 15 years and all the characters in this story don't age a day (maybe in the book they do but the movie made no effort in showing it). This is the kind of story that would require more actors and actresses (like in The Notebook, although in a much smaller scale). I'm sorry, I know Lily and Sam are some good looking actors but at the beginning they did not look like they were in... High School, i guess? Even as seniors, I mean, they even try pulling some weird fring hairstyle for Alex but it doesn't do the trick.All I'm saying is, this movie screams Hollywood blockbuster with just two actors so they can ship better their chemistry and whatnot all while, in the back, telling really compelling points about life and all its turns and the missed opportunities that can never be recover (just like how Nicholas Sparks does it only they can keep the happy ending). This story really had some important messages to say to the audience but fell flat on its face because Hollywood just wanted another well-dressed, everyone-is-pretty and all-the-scenes-are-polished movie.","Love, Rosie"

45,hthbrr2,Perfect example of everything wrong with movies these days.,1,1 March 2015,"OK so we have nepotistic casting? Check. We have actors desperate to be leading ones even though they can never carry a movie? Check. A trailer that reveals the whole movie/predictable/no suspense ending. Check. A unrealistic plot by any stretch of the imagination? Check. The whole movie is dedicated solely to launch there actors careers/not about the actual plot? Check.Yeah I mean this would have been an acceptable movie to just watch and not expect much out of it. But it was so painful to watch, as per the reasons listed above. The movie was SO irritating!Lily Collins, people like your face too bad you can't act. Very telling is that she actually auditioned for the role of Bella Swan in Twilight! Meaning giving blank stares and not actually acting. Dare I say I need to give Kristen Stewart some credit next to Lily she can act up a storm.I kid you not, whole SCENES were her making BLANK stares. And this was supposed to emit 'emotion'? Yeah that just emits that you can't act. Also her hair being in her face, are you kidding me?The rest of the actors do what they can with what they have. But when the plot makes such little sense, you can't really do much. I mean they went though so much and still they did not get together? What? I mean ONE of the things that happened to them would/should have sent them into each others arms. So why did that not happen? Oh right check the list ""unrealistic plot"". Also if they got together there would be no movie.That's another reason this movie is so tedious. It's not over until they get together. Wow talk about waiting for the Jeopardy music to end. So stupid.Another thing I resented was the sound levels. Their words are whisper quiet. Then there is blasting loud music.

48,Ingrouille181,Believable love story with unbelievable parts,7,15 March 2018,"I remembered seeing a trailer for this film on YouTube; didn't interest me, but I remembered the poster standing out. And after watching Hunger Games, I was interested in seeing more Sam Claflin films, so I put it in my mental list.Story: Best friends Rosie and Alex go their separate ways after secondary school, with Alex moving to America and Rosie accidentally becoming pregnant after prom night. As the years go by, Rose and Alex gamble everything to keep their friendship alive, while love also springs between them.Good set up, good cast. Overall I enjoyed it, and my favourite part was definitely Lily Collins and Sam Claflin's chemistry. I thought it was believable how they transitioned from best friends to being in love at the end, even if a few scenes felt pointless. I also enjoyed the friendship between Rosie and her friend Ruby. I liked the supporting characters Sally and Bethany. I thought the pacing was fine, I wasn't bored at all watching it.I have negatives of course so 1) the fact that they don't age. I get it since two attractive people have been cast in the roles and they probably don't want to recast them. But seriously, Rosie's daughter is 14 or 15 years old by the end, and they look like sisters. Age up your actors; it's distracting. Keeps reminding me of the McAvoy/Fassbender X-Men films; Age for crying out loud! I mean a lot times you'd probably forget that since Collins and Claflin have such great chemistry, but once they stop talking to each other it becomes distracting again.Also, there is one completely cartoon character: Greg, Rosie's baby daddy and later husband. If Greg exists in the books and is accurate to the book character; fair enough. But it was the laziest way to portray a deadbeat. There's a scene where Rosie and Alex are at Rosie's dad's funeral; it's raining and tries to portray itself as a serious seen. But, Greg straight up walks up to the two, puts on his glasses, acting like he's at a party and goofing around. What!?? Is the script so desperate to portray Greg as a douche, they had to resort to that. Who ok'd that. If you need a scene like that, don't put it in a funeral scene.I enjoy romantic films when I'm in the mood, and apart from those few distracting elements, I enjoyed the film. I'd recommend it, just watch out for those things I've mentioned.","Love, Rosie"
49,jadediamond,Really enjoyed this movie,7,30 September 2019,"I really enjoyed this cute little movie about best friends since childhood who secretly like one another, but never has the guts to tell one another how they feel. The story spans over twelve years of their lives from high school to their late twenties. Others say this movie is unrealistic or farfetched. I think this movie hit a nerve with some females, because females have an automatically understood girl code that you shouldn't try to take another woman's man even if the woman is narcissistic or not the kindest person. So the fact that in one scene Rosie declares her love for Sam at his wedding reception, hit them the wrong way.Sam and Rosie's relationship is a series of missed opportunities like wanting to go to the dance together and Sam goes out with Bethany since Rosie acts like she's not into him and then mocks Sam for being a virgin. And Rosie goes out with another guy because Sam told her Bethany wanted to go out with him, but he turned her down because he didn't want Rosie to go to the dance alone. When Rosie gives him the okay, he begins dating Bethany and losing his virginity to her to Rosie's disappointment. So at the dance, she losing her virginity in three seconds. Sam suggests they go to school in Boston. He gets accepted into Harvard. She gets accepted into Boston College, but can't go because she finds out she's pregnant with three second's guy kid. She refuses to tell Sam she's pregnant because she's afraid she'll hold him back. But nearly a year later, Bethany who has gone on in life to become a successful model after high school spots her and ends up finding out she's a mother now. She tells Sam and all Sam does is fly backs to surprise her and asks to be the godfather. And this is the movie. She visits Sam in Boston years later and finds out his girlfriend is pregnant. He shames her for being a single mom and brags about his unborn kid having two married parents. In retaliation, she hooks up with three seconds guy who wants to be in their kid's life now five years later because he has abs. She marries him because she want to belong to someone. Yet, at the wedding, she's looking for Sam instead of her groom. Instead of Sam telling her how he feels, he's bum out because he found out that his girlfriend cheated on him and the baby isn't his (which happens to alot of men in real life). He broke up with her the day Rosie married three seconds guy. Her husband ends up booking a hotel suite at one of her hotel chains and gets caught. Now, that part was stupid. But maybe he did so on purpose to get rid of her. Sometimes, when you're tired of being in a relationship, you self-sabotage yourself. She sees Bethany who is now more famous and suggest she visits Sam in New York. Rosie finds a letter where Sam somewhat confessed his feelings after he gets engaged. But by the time Rosie is ready to declare her love for Sam, her flight arrives too late and he's already married to Bethany. Rosie ends up giving the most awkward wedding speeches making it blatantly obvious she's in love with her best friend. You already know they end up together. It's just a series of weird mishaps before it gets to the happy ending.Yet, it was a good movie if you're into romance movies. People mom shamed Lilly Collins in a good way for looking too old to be a high school student but looking too young to be a mom. Umm, most people's bodies start to grey in their thirties but they don't physically change until after their forties. So it is realistic to look the exact same way you did in high school at age 30 with the exception of a few different hairstyles and clothes if one keeps themselves up. Your personal life may be different based on the choices you make in life, but your physical appearance tends to remain the same unless you let yourself go. But I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't One Day or The Notebook. It would have been cuter and stronger maybe if they rekindled later in life and ended up together. But I liked the movie. It was cute and sweet and reminds us sometimes you got to take a chance even if you fear rejection. And maybe you'll find love sooner than wasting years of your life with the wrong person.","Love, Rosie"
50,ingmarbeldman-753-927212,promising actress lost in dramatic story that doesn't show drama,5,26 October 2015,"First of all i would not judge this film to strongly, since we're dealing with a sort of coming-of-age drama (although not being a real good excuse, right? producers..?).When the drama starts of we land in a cliché high school, teenage drama with shy kissing and flat expositions of insecureness etc... The two protagonists are portrayed in their childhood. fair enough. but flat. really flat.The initial moment of miscommunication between the two protagonists, which is supposed to serve as a foundation for the rest of the drama, is just one single moment of 'both-are-too-shy- to-speak-out-their-love'. It's just one moment, not very dramatic and way too thin to make them be insecure to each other for the rest of their twenties and thirties. From there they loose me...Important moments, where drama could be cooking and ambivalent moments and intentions - which are the key element for drama - could be exposed, the writer just jumps over those moments and continues the story with only the consequences of that drama... and leaving me dissatisfied. It gives the film very irrational time-leaps. It's like me looking at my girlfriend saying: ...ehh...what just happened? Did i miss something? Contributing to this feeling is the horrible make-up. At some point the story takes a jump of 5 and guess what? Nobody changed. Literally. a few scenes further the make-up must have thought: 'shit, we forgot something!!' and suddenly, out of the blue, Collins has a few gray hairs behind the ears...Altogether, this makes the flow of the movie slow and unbelievable. It makes the actors being mere puppets then initiators. With that comes the very dissatisfying acting of Claflin and his love-affairs, as most of the other extra's. Collins stands alone and stands. She is, as far as i can judge, ready for a strong character drama. Promising lady!!","Love, Rosie"
51,FlickChick82,"Love, this film",10,12 November 2014,"This is my first review here so bear with me. As I'm sure most of you know, this movie is based on a novel Where rainbows end by Cecilia Ahern. It is just loosely based on it, because the story differs somewhat. I won't reveal anything else, to avoid spoilers. All I'll say is that it works because it captures the essence of the book. The chemistry between the two main actors is unbelievably good and the supporting cast is good as well. I warmly recommend this film to everybody. How probable the plot, that is up to a viewer to decide. It was for me. If you're a hopeless romantic, you're gonna enjoy this one. If you're a realist, you're probably gonna find certain situations a bit too much and out there. Nonetheless I left the theater with a smile on my face. The movie makes you believe that anything is possible and that one should never give up on hope.","Love, Rosie"

53,natsuka_arei,Expect more from the story,7,11 November 2016,"I start to watch Love, Rosie since Sam who plays in Me Before You, play as well as Alex in Love, Rosie. I was so mesmerized by him ( You have to check him in that movie. A heart touching one which gives a realistic point of view about love and life, dream and hope. )Sad to be told, the plot itself is quite interesting at first but getting lame along with the story.It's a story about two best friends, who knows each other so well, so close, and everything goes well until love grows up between them. They struggle to be together, but always miss the timing. We can say, every moment and event turn out to separates them so they end up with the others. Both Alex and Rosie, play the role well. The chemistry does exist between them. Though, the lack of development of all the characters can be seen through the story. Iwas hope there was more than that. Sometimes, the pattern which separates them, over and over again, makes the story appears as boring and unrealistic one. It is still a good movie though, for those who likes romance and the idea of fated loved.","Love, Rosie"
54,david-fernandez,It's a rubbish rom com that trivialises young single parents,1,7 July 2016,"The writing is wannabe Richard Curtis (Four Weddings and A Funeral), there are wannabe Hugh Grants, a wannabe Keira Knightley. Best friends, girl and boy since the age of 5, girl gets pregnant by an irresponsible guy who runs off, the original male friend goes to NY and hooks up with a hot model wife ... I just don't want to even think about it. It makes light of failed young relationships where a kid is involved and that true love cannot be found with a hot wife in Manhattan with a great job and materialistic life style, instead dreary England with a hot but not as hot girl who has a child by another man is a better option. I think I'd choose the emotionally challenged hot wife in Manhattan thank you very much. It's unconvincing, it's unrealistic, people are not willing to sacrifice what they have for a person with baggage across the Atlantic. The single parent girl in England even accepts the bum dad that abandoned his child in the first place and gets burnt, so the girl in England is portrayed as stupid and irresponsible also. There's even the inevitable rush at the end as the person whose made a series of relationship mistakes runs to what she believes to be the true love of her life and vice versa, that good old Rom Com cliché I just hate this movie, I want my electricity paid for which I spent on the TV watching this drivel, I want my 110 minutes or so back where I could have been asleep instead....","Love, Rosie"

The trailer fascinates me but the whole story feels like predictable and cheesy. There are lots of events until they reach the end of their story. From the pregnancy to the teenage year of her daughter. I can say its predictable due to the fact that every time they had a chance to be together, a new conflict between their relationship occurs. If im not been mistaken, it happened 3 times but im thankful they end up happy together.I rate it 80% due to lots of extended scenes which at some point helps the viewer to understand more about the growth of the character but still it turns out to bore some people.","Love, Rosie"

The English? lead actors and actresses are incredibly beautiful / cute / handsome almost to a fault. The American system of university education is highly misunderstood and misrepresented in terms of number of years required for a degree, and difficulty and cost of such an education. Likewise for some other financial aspects of the film. These petty reality details aside, it works as the leads are charming with lovely smiles that melt our hearts, and the story is heart-felt. Who can fault such a sweet romance, fraught with difficulties. And some of the scenery is stunning. Enjoy it but don't over-analyze it.","Love, Rosie"

All chances to tell their feeling each other fail to coincide. Each of two grow and know own feeling, so their love develops.I feel this film is a common establishment of story, but actions of Rosie and Alex too be too untimely. When Rosie become honest, Alex is awfully busy. When Alex is approach to her, Rosie can't notice. There are many misunderstanding and passing each other without meeting, which makes me nervous.

Only those with a particularly perverse sense of humor can truly label this a romcom. A few sporadic laughs a comedy do not make, my friend. So, watcher, be forewarned. Expect drama bordering on melodrama and only then might you like it. Otherwise, you'll be staring at the screen wondering where your comic relief for the night went... and that's straight out the window, I'm afraid. It's almost two hours of psychological torture when you're expecting the mood to lighten up and it never does. IMDb needs to get its category labeling in order. Anyway, the movie itself isn't half bad. The acting is believable, the story's engaging. It's just not a comedy. So know what you're getting into. I wish someone told me that.","Love, Rosie"

So let me expand a bit - the writing is clichéd and so obvious, that it's embarrassing. I checked to see if an 8 year old had written the story, but that isn't the case.When you can easily guess where the story goes in the next minute, over and over, you can be sure that it becomes tiring very quickly. Even the funnier parts are ruined by the joke missing the point when it should end.The acting (and that may be stretching it a bit) is wooden, with plenty of woodworm.On the plus side... errrrm.

74,djuka_007-984-382493,More twists then your average thriller,4,10 July 2016,"Rom-coms are a special type of movies. In some aspects they are equivalent to a junk food - something that's your guilty pleasure, that you know is way beyond your usual type of movies, but you just want a quick fix of dopamine and you go with it. And just like with the junk food, the ingredients always tend to be the same - people come for their favorite snack because they know what to expect. But just like when Coca Cola tried to introduce its new taste to the general public, these things usually backfire. So you either need to stick to the well known or try to be completely original, but you can never go half way. And this is what we see in this movie. They try to be unpredictable by putting in so many twist that an average soap opera wold be proud of it. Yet all this twists seem so predictable that you have to ask yourself - ""why bother?"". In the end you get something that neither smells nor stinks, and that's never a good thing.","Love, Rosie"

It's a comedy, it has romance but my way of seeing it has a certain amount of drama in this motion picture and I can't go further with an explanation because I don't want to spoil with this comment. It's simply amazing, it's a great movie and it has the simplest way to show you life as it is, as we know it even thou we do not realize it.I have to congratulate the idea of this kind of scenario; from my point of view, it was simply a great idea!","Love, Rosie"
78,LaughySaphy,Lost count of the rewatches (but I still suggest you read the book),10,21 March 2020,"Timing is everything.I've been a fan of ""Where rainbows end"" that the movie is based on since 2010 and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that someone's finally turning it into a movie. My relationship with it changed over time: on the first try I would've rated it a 7 because it departs from the book I adore sooooo much (why do that to Ruby and Greg?), on the third rewatch I thought okay maybe a 9 because the ending actually makes me much happier that the original, on the eeehm sixth review (I've lost count by now) I knew it's a 10/10 forever.
That's because this movie is so life-asserting and hopeful - wouldn't you love to know that even after all the mistakes you've made and all the times you got the timing wrong, if you work on it, you can power through and get the happy ending you truly deserve. And actors are amazing, that's exactly how I pictured Alex! The music is great too.All in all, I have no idea who would give this movie a negative review, it's great and you'll definitely love it!","Love, Rosie"
79,Itsevelynchy64,One of my fav rom-com!,10,18 January 2021,"Yeh, right. It was underrated! I even wanted it to be 11/10.
Well, I admit that the prefect casting has already won my heart and taken up maybe 7/10 lol. Sam Claflin and Lily Collins are so good together and they should win the Best Onscreen Couple in Hum. And the rest of the 3/10 is according to some credible reasons why you should go watch it immediately if you are wondering if it is good.
First, do not like over-twisted plot throughout the storyline cuz we search for rom-coms with predictable content and happy ending.
Secondly, a charming axis of time makes all these things even more fascinating. We watched them grew up, became mature, had family and partners while continually loving, and cherishing each other, till they finally revealed their hearts and came together, which they've been waiting and pretending for soooo long. Which "" Better late than never"" by Rosie in the last scene couldn't be more aptly quoted.
Lastly, what else could be more romantic than best friends turned out to be lovers together? When you fall for your best friend but in the wrong timing, you feel like the luckiest yet the most unfortunate. That's why this movie is always haunting.
I loved the wedding scene that Rosie said: ""Because sometimes you don't see that the best thing that has ever happened to you is sitting there, right under your nose. But that's fine too. It really is. Because I've realized that no matter where you are, or what you're doing, or who you're with, I'll always honestly, truly, completely, love you."" ""I will always stand guard over your dream, Alex. No matter how weird or twisted they get."" I cried everytime I watched.","Love, Rosie"
80,NielaC,Nice,7,9 July 2015,"Despite the movie lacks originality in its theme and plot, I oddly found it very pleasant to watch. I was in the middle of a very stressed day and the movie was playing on the next room. I entered my friend's room thinking it would be the same old story about two friends falling in love (as seen multiple times) and I grabbed the popcorn. It might be the stress and the popcorn that changed my point of view, the thing is that I found it better than some of the other love stories. The characters were OK. I recognized the actors from some other movies and series, which is always nice. They looked like having a great connection on screen and that was exactly what was intended. Somehow there was a bit too much of mess in the lives of the two for the general public to relate to. Too many marriages, fake marriages, kids, fake kids and divorces between the main characters. If they had cut it down and explored a bit more the part of their adolescent, the times previous the pregnancy, it would be so much better. In the end, I think it was a ""good waste"" of time (at least better than reading a magazine). If you want to know if you should watch the movie, go for it. Your head will be occupied for a bit with light stuff.","Love, Rosie"

Rose and Alex, brilliantly acted by Lily Collins and Sam Claflin, had great chemistry that you rooted for them throughout. Yes, it is a chick flick, but the rich comedy of errors and ""safe"" sex scenes make it humorous for both sexes, with enough drama to make it truly worthwhile.

They are just fit perfectly in place. Lily is a perfect Rosie and Sam is the best Alex. Every situation, every scene, every coincidence in the movie just remind me of our real life. We can't expect everything to be like we want it to be. You can't push your crush to another girl because you think that he has been your friends since you were young, so 'he has to be your best friends forever' 
 This movie teaches me so many things like 'If you never ask, the answer will always be no' Sometimes said something out loud is better than left it unsaid. At least you had a chance to say it out. Whether it ends in a good way or a bad way, it was experience.
 If you are the sensitive person, this movie will be the reason for teardrops on your cheeks. I was crying during many scenes, they are so touchy.

103,cactus1305,Lots of Suspension required.,4,9 May 2015,"This movie reminded me of the bad version of One Day (the movie version) which in turn was the very bad version of One Day (the book version).I could suspend disbelief with regards to a lot of things that other viewers had a problem with:1. Maybe property prices are cheaper in the UK so she would have been able to afford a walk up on a receptionist's salary. 2. Maybe having one boyfriend from the age of 5 is actually genetic so that's why her daughter did exactly the same things she did. 3. Maybe people do still write letters because hey, you know, it might be easier to find a post box at the airport than an email terminal. 4. Maybe they got fares to Boston on the cheap despite only having one week's notice and that's why they could fly all 4 of them to the US for the wedding. 5. She IS only 30. It isn't entirely impossible that she didn't really age between 18 and 30. 6. Potentially no one lives in the country, so realistically she could have bought it on the cheap and gotten a bank loan for a huge part of the purchase price of that mansion. 7. Her mother probably did want to downsize and that's why she received her father's share of the house even though her mother and two younger brothers are still alive and potentially now homeless.I could keep going but you get the idea. Maybe. But despite that suspending, I still couldn't suspend my irritation with the way the story is constructed. Or the dialogue. Or the ending (OK! I know! It could only ever have ended that way). Finnick from the Hunger Games continues to be sweetly good looking though.","Love, Rosie"
104,sal-j,Love this movie,10,20 February 2019,"Very lovely, moving movie.
It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found it to be a funny, romantic teen/but not teen movie. It dealt with more adult issues rather than your normal teen movie.
I think it's definitely worth a watch.","Love, Rosie"
105,BillyOceansBlues,"Buy the ticket, take the ride",8,17 June 2021,"We all know what we're getting into when we start up a movie like this. The formula is readily apparent throughout the entire movie. With each twist and turn and little maybe-dang-not-yet moment, it's easy to see what the filmmakers want us to feel during any given scene. And that's fine. You started this movie because you're looking for something emotional, sappy, and maybe a receptacle to dump your own sadness into (full-disclosure, that may have been why I started it up). I was surprised at how brutal things turn out for her, though. Lots of disappointment, personal disaster and trauma. Honestly, this movie is pretty dark in that respect (also in general I think that culturally, British people are just more brutal and rude to each other than Americans, particularly school-aged Brits, which probably added to the grim vibe as we watch her life unravel). This is all expected and fine. The real bone I have to pick is with the ""main guy"". How many times does he just flat out decide not to be with her? Like six?? Seriously by the end of the movie, I actively wanted them to not end up together. What a loser! He literally brings nothing to the table. There is nothing special, unique, resilient, or attractive about this guy. A much healthier revelation for her would have been that she needs to stop worrying about this idiot who literally marries other women and get on with her life. Seek something healthy and honest. I'm not surprised by the ending, like I said the formula is front and center the whole time, but really, this guy was not a worthy receptacle for her love. What she went through versus what he went through is as different as night and day. Not a believable couple by the end. But you know what? I was swept up in it the whole time. So the story wasn't the peak of narrative form. I didn't turn this on to experience literature, I turned it on to run from my own life and indulge in some gushy emotions. In that respect, this movie nails it.","Love, Rosie"

110,chloejane37,A nice romantic comedy and good for a couple of giggles,6,21 January 2015,"Based on the book ""Where Rainbows End"" by Cecelia Ahern where –long story short- Alex and Rosie are perfect for each other but for whatever reason keep getting pushed apart. I read the book earlier in the year after learning that it would later be adapted into a film. Although I enjoyed the book towards the end it was becoming more and more irritating that they still weren't together.In that sense, the film is exactly the same. Each time they have a chance to be together something happens or gets in the way. I guess this is what makes the film last longer and feel a lot slower than what it actually is. I was more than disappointed with the way that parts I found funny in the book were completely exaggerated in the film.However, saying that, the film wasn't entirely awful. Lily Collins as Rosie and Sam Clafin as Alex in my opinion couldn't have been better chosen for the roles. They were exactly as I pictured in the book and I think without them the film would have been a complete disaster.It's worth the watch if you have a couple of hours spare and want to have a little giggle at a romantic comedy but if you've read the book then don't have too high expectations.","Love, Rosie"

112,onedreamguy,Flat,6,11 July 2016,"Many friends of mine went crazy about this movie and I was like ""Are you kidding me?"". I was not so bored that I turned the TV off after 30 minutes but I watched the movie feeling nothing. I haven't read the book yet and I don't know how good it is, but the movie wasn't convincing enough for me. I failed in my attempt to understand why they didn't just spilled out their feelings for each other. Besides, pregnancy and getting married is kind of a big deal but I couldn't feel it in this movie. Both Lily Collins and Sam Claflin are good-looking but the fact that their characters' appearances don't change after all those years is, to me, a big minus point. However, this is just my opinion, and a movie is good or bad is up to you.","Love, Rosie"

120,doctorjacksonlocked,Would Recommend to Anyone Who Likes Romantic Films,5,26 March 2020,"It's an enjoyable story, but it ultimately lacks both craft and nuance. While they do a good job of making the leads likeably messed up, all the side characters are caricatures and all the partners of the leads are so cartoonishly awful that the audience can't help but wondee how the failed relationships, which all progressed offscreen or in montage, could ever become so serious. The themes are interesting, but the film repeatedly has the characters state them explicitly rather than letting them shine through the story naturally. However, if you like romantic films, I would recommend as it is an interesting (if flawed) take on the genre that says something worth saying.","Love, Rosie"
121,PuddlesGalore,Shockingly Bad!,1,21 February 2015,"Somehow i made it to the end of this movie in spite of questioning myself the whole way through as to why I was giving it my time. I think this has more to do with my inability to stop something half-way through or perhaps my willing it to get better & leave me feeling at least somewhat satisfied. Not. This. Film. They were so busy squeezing in the many missed opportunities the leads had of getting together that they forgot to give them personalities or anything for the audience to care about! The script was weak at best (& at times simply confusing in its empty/fast-forwarded-ness), the acting was mostly unconvincing & the characters so badly stereotyped that they couldn't have any credence at all. Add this to some been there, done that, attempts at comedic moments & you have a deeply vapid experience that laughs at the audience for staying the course. As you can tell, i found nothing redeeming in this movie at all & cannot understand why it has 7 stars. There was nothing new or clever or interesting or emotive in this film...so what's the point?","Love, Rosie"
122,carlaesler,Awesome Romcom,9,22 November 2020,"Firstly, Lily and Sam were perfect as Rosie and Alex- so much chemistry. This movie demonstrates how things can turn out when people don't say how that feel, but also that sometimes people need to take certain paths and learn things along the way before they see what they really want. Perhaps, if Rosie and Sam realised they were in love as teenagers and began a relationship, they may not have lasted as they had not yet lived. It's about choices and growth. This movie may have been a little predictable but it's a Romcom! I really enjoyed it and I am not ashamed to admit I had a little 😥(perhaps big😭) cry at the end. Love is beautiful and Rosie and Alex were certainly in love. Just gorgeous 💞","Love, Rosie"
123,jaimewender,A Solid Film,7,7 October 2021,"Overall, this was a cute, enjoyable movie. It was predictable (as 99% of romantic comedies are) but I liked it anyway because it has heart and quality acting.

Other than that - solid film.","Love, Rosie"
124,drsmoove,A chick flick that a guy can enjoy too.,9,24 September 2019,"As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a ""When Harry Met Sally"" vibe in there, but truly original romcoms are as rare as unicorns.

If you like the Hallmark stuff you're gonna love this one.","Love, Rosie"
125,gabeeaster,"For The Time Allotted, It Captures A lot",8,29 June 2016,"In order to properly capture the chemistry of two people who've been friends since childhood, and it's a difficult task at that, one would need hours and to many that would probably become a bit boring after a while. ""Love, Rosie"" does a great job in attempting to fill such a tall order with the time it is given.It touches selectively on the most important moments of Rosie's and Alex's relationship and while it may be a bit choppy at times, its selection is as complete as it can be, and very grounded in reality. I think the chemistry is akin to most you'll find in real life - affectionate, caring, but at times a bit disingenuous.It suffers from a few things however. The letter and the fairy tale ending. Seldom would I think a man would keep a letter from another man to his wife. I think a majority would agree they would burn it. And then, she found it very conveniently. The ending in the book was much better and perhaps more realistic as to how things in life sometimes play out. Not always the way we want it to, and not always at the time we want it to.As far as romantic movies go, though, this is one of the best ones. It's as frustratingly wonderful as its predecessors and a lovely modern and realistic take on a subject we have been trying to understand since time began.","Love, Rosie"
126,bmari-24060,Weak,3,21 December 2017,"How anyone can find this movie romantic is beyond me (this is coming form a female of the intended demographic). It is your typical vapid shallow superficial Hollywood take on love, without having any of the sheen, glamour and high production quality of a Hollywood rom com. Therefore, it falls flat and is very tedious and hard to watch. Not only is it completely unfunny, disjointed and filled with unnecessary profanity, it is also implausible. Surely the fact that Alex always chose some other girl before Rosie meant that he didn't really like her all that much and therefore could not be so in love with her for so long. I know that is how it works in that little land called reality. Therefore. I could never truly buy into this 'love story' if you can even call it that, although love montage would be more suitable. I also do not care for the actor who played Alex much. He doesn't possess a leading man quality and was not convincing in this role. Romance must truly be dead in this day in age if this is what people consider to be romantic.","Love, Rosie"

129,sheena_dowd,Rather disappointing,3,14 November 2015,"I was mildly interested to watch this film given it's overall IMDb rating of 7.2 but found it really lacking in so many ways. Too many misunderstandings and drunken forgotten moments which kept the people who should be together, apart. Then it's like a massive slice of over mature cheddar at times (often). For me, the film dragged on with the promise of improvement, which unfortunately it did not manage to deliver. No possible explanation for the very poor hair piece worn by the main male character for the first half of the film. And no signs of ageing at all on any of the characters over the decade and a half this film covers. I usually agree with IMDb's over all rating and that is why I've been disappointed in this film to the degree that I had to voice my opinion. IMHO it is not in the 7's - it is in the 3's.","Love, Rosie"

WTF?!!! Totallylacking in any credibility at all on the most basic level...rubbish!!It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or- less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem Epsom' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

131,ChristieGraham91193,Failures as a Film,4,9 March 2015,"While I haven't yet read ""Where Rainbows End"" I can already tell the adaption from novel to film was a poor one.Establishing the friendship between Alex and Rosie seems crucial from the get-go and that didn't happen in the film. We see snippets of what they were like as kids growing up together and see it paralleled with Rosie's daughter however these are vomited all over the trailer so there's nothing really new for the audience on that front.The main factor that irritates me throughout the film is if they're such good friends why do they have so many issues such as lying to each other to 'protect' one another and 'I was going to tell you''s.. I've learnt if you love someone you are 100% in; it's all or nothing. You can't just say ""I want what's best for you"" or ""I'm letting you go because I care"". No. If you love someone, you hold on with everything you have because you know deep down in your gut you both will NOT function to the best of your abilities without the other. Rosie and Alex don't do this. I understand they also do this because they think the other doesn't feel that way about them (which to be fair Rosie put her foot in it when she said she regretted that whole night of her birthday.. yes ALL of it) but there should be time for second chances and redemption.Overall, the book would surely be better but the casting was still wonderful.","Love, Rosie"

For me the book was both tragic and entertaining at times... But there was nothing ""they lived happily ever after""in it.. Rosie and Alex missed so many chances ( as it happens in life) and they finally had courage to be together in their 50's... And yes- that was the very happy moment for me as a reader and I almost jumped when they finally got together...But the movie didn't gave me that jump... I have ready many books and then watched many movies based on them books...and that's why I can honestly state here: Read the book ( I think it's one of the best C.Aherns books) and watch the movie..But don't expect nothing special...","Love, Rosie"

Some of the information are skipped, but you can guess what happens next. It's like a light reading after a hard day. I like Alex's transformation. The I liked it was focused on both Rosie an Alex's life and that it clearly shows how a girl can over think an issue. It features the story of true love, that one that at the beginning was pure and innocent and at the end is mature and responsible. I liked how Rosie kept her hope alive, that she will have her own business and also how she raised her child. It's based on the typical teenage love problems. Also it caught the the fact that girls like Bethany always have more success in life and that boys like Greg always disappoint.I recommend it to teenagers who rush into life without thinking ;)","Love, Rosie"

Overall the film has a lot of heart and the characters are portrayed well, there are some real uplifting moments in this film with some more sad bits as well. My biggest problem with the film is that from the word go, you know exactly how the film is going to play out. There are multiple times in this film where one of the main characters admits their love for the other, only to find out that the other has made a big step commitment wise with another person. We all know that they will both soon realise their strong feelings for each other. I hope it doesn't come across that I disliked the film, I actually quite enjoyed this film. It's a good film to watch for a family night in, or if your girlfriend or boyfriend is round and you want to watch a run of the mill romance story.","Love, Rosie"

There was issue that should be solved in the end of story and the process, I should say, long. There was a heartbreaking *much*, and I actually decided not to continue read the book after watching this. I thought this movie itself enough to give me the impression that the book was actually really good. Yap! This movie was romantic of course, and good, really good.

I have now reached out to watch it twice even though I thoroughly know the plot line now it still jerks tears in the most raw of the scenes. The plot differs slightly from the book and this is the only real issue that I have with the film although I understand that it is a lot harder to go over a larger time span when creating something to watch rather than something to read. In the book everything 'moves' a lot slower and so more of the relationship between main characters is established and therefore some things can make more sense rather than appearing random or spontaneous on screen. Overall, I would love there to be a sequel to this film even though I know that this is near on impossible to accomplish. Cecelia Ahern is a miracle worker when it comes to writing books and there should be more films made of her work. P.S. I Love You is another good film recommendation from her books.","Love, Rosie"

146,brianasantillana,Painfully Frustrating,2,15 January 2020,"Spoiler alertIt feels like a 12 year old wrote this script.I do however love Lily Collins and her acting in this movie, so my criticism is wholly towards the writers.This movie is so unbelievably unrealistic and removed from reality it is mind- boggling. There are 4 major life events between this couple where they each CHOOSE someone or something that brings them further away from each other. But if the idiotic choices of these people who apparently ache to be together wasn't enough, it is equally annoying the way these huge life decisions just conveniently get tossed to the wayside as if they didn't happen.I mean how many times in one movie can both people marry the person they don't love, or have a child with the person they don't love, and then every time  the bad relationship unravels because the partner cheated. I mean come on! Come on! What?? How are people giving this a 10 star? There are zero stakes in this movie. Even the climactic ending had very little effect on me, because he's now married to another woman! Does that mean nothing? The conclusion of their 12 year supposed romance is a weekend hotel fling?? Did he just annul the marriage and forget to mention it? Another huge life decision zapped away by bad writing.This is why I love Jane Eyre over most chick flicks today. When Rochester proposes she stay with him despite being married, most chick flick leads just melt, as if the offer is enough. But not Jane Eyre. She turns down the love of her life for SELF RESPECT!Ladies, choices matter! To me, it's a self respect sin to give everything to someone who has you as their weekend fling. It does not matter what they say, or how they make you feel. That's all garbage if you're not the one they're going home to at the end of the day and giving everything for.","Love, Rosie"

150,delbv9,Feels like the classics,8,1 March 2015,"Finally, a really good Rom-Com movie in years. It's funny, it's entertaining, it's a mood changing movie. This movie makes me remember the good old days in the early 2000s, which are the glory years of Rom-Com movies. 'Love, Rosie' brings back the cute sort of goofy story, charismatic characters and of course amazing soundtrack.Props to Juliette Towhidi for beautifully packaging the story from the novel by Cecelia Ahern, who is well-known as the writer of P.S. I love you. Also the adorable Lily Collins really brings good performance as the lead and Sam Claflin almost feels like the young Hugh Grant. 'Love, Rosie' is the best Rom-Com movie of 2014, Cheers.","Love, Rosie"
151,pyro089,Too predictable and too much flaws,6,3 August 2019,"I don't actually complain about movies or whatsoever, but there few flaws1. How did Greg booked in the same hotel as Rosie was working in2. I think Greg and Alex wore the same jacket I guess or maybe I am wrong.Wasting all those years to hold and tell what you've in your heart was just stupid, relying on other relationships showing too much adult being so screwed up, movies should give lessons to life not to messed up more.","Love, Rosie"
152,herbiethecar,You won't care that you can see the ending coming,8,2 November 2014,"A clichéd rom-com. Shocker. For all those reviewers out there saying that this is a bad film because it's predictable, I'd like you to point me to one that's not. Yes, you can see the ending coming from a mile off but that's really not the point, because if you go to see a romantic comedy for a twist ending then you really shouldn't be watching these kinds of films. This was refreshingly English, with two brilliant leads in Collins and Claflin, who had great chemistry on screen and were very much believable as almost lovers. It was a really touching story as well, and it was nice to see a film about two nice people who were incredibly selfless - I saw someone complain about how many times other things got in the way. This was because the other things getting in the way were what the two characters thought was best for the other, they just wanted each other to be happy, no matter what else was going on around them. Yes, the plot was a little bit all over the place and some of the time jumps felt unnecessary, but it was hardly a deal breaker, in some ways complimenting the hectic nature of these star-crossed lovers' lives. A lovely film that really warms you up inside, and well worth the watch if you enjoy rom-coms, although it's unlikely to sway any non-believers in the genre.And you know what? Clichés exist because they work. And this film very much works.","Love, Rosie"
153,knorr102,A good romantic movie,9,12 April 2015,"As a fan of the original book ""Where Rainbows End"", I had been kind of disappointed when people told me that there are many differences between the novel and its adaption on the big screen. However, I changed my prejudice when I finally saw it myself. The movie is romantic, with beautiful-filmed scenes (I love the color throughout the whole movie), and moving. The music sounds good (gotta buy the soundtrack!) too. And I love Lily and Sam Claflin as Rosie and Alex, as you can really feel the chemistry between them from the very first minutes of the film. Perfect casting :) I don't care about how unreal the plot is. It just feels good watching a slice-of-life movie like this once in a while.","Love, Rosie"

I'm in similar situation with my best friend and this movie helps me to realize that there is not time for waste. Happiness is one of most important thing in life. In fact, we must do everything we can to be happy even taking the risk to be disappointed. Many people in real life are in this situation and that is sad because a little of them take the risk and find their happiness. Love, Rosie will helps to realize that waiting is not the solution. The solution is to follow your heart because it will never wrong. This kind of love in the movie is one of the purest and truly love - love between friends grown in something bigger - True Love. The movie deserves your time and attention.","Love, Rosie"
156,sreya3,Nothing new.,4,22 August 2020,"When I started watching the movie, I thought it was going to be a solid 7 stars. The characters were cute. Acting was good. Their chemistry was great and I do love the friends to lovers trope. I liked how they talked about not giving up on your dreams when life throws you curveballs and not feeling like your life is over because you had to pause to raise a child.But the longer the movie went on the lower my rating started getting. The plot was getting repetitive and cliched. They kept going round in circles.Also I absolutely hate it when in romances they do this thing where everyone else the leads date except for the other lead has to be bad. Like a liar or a cheater or a narcissist you name it, just so you can root for the leads to get together instead. You shouldn't have to do that, you should be able to give us a reason to root for the leads that isn't 'everyone else bad'. Imagine how much more interesting it would have been if the other people they married were actually great people. Who do they pick now?And i stopped believing in their chemistry when we would jump over years of time where they didn't speak to each other. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever watched, I did watch all of it. I'm just disappointed in it because I was expecting more.","Love, Rosie"
157,churchie58,An absolute waste of time,1,4 May 2019,A pale movie about friendship and love which made no sense. Just an amalgamation of bizzare life events.,"Love, Rosie"
158,piroman-2,I very liked this movie,10,11 February 2015,"Love, Rosie begins with the titular lead (played by the impressively eyebrow ed Lily Collins) sobbing at a wedding. Flashback 12 years when the course of true love started going awry: On her 18th birthday, after several shots and lost in the rhythm of Beyonce's Crazy in Love, Rosie kisses her best friend, Alex (Sam Claflin, best known for his shirtless performance in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire). The next day, Rosie tells Alex she doesn't remember anything about the night, least of all locking lips. So Alex, who relished the moment, bottles up his feelings for his friend. The pair then spend the next decade-plus trying to tell each other how they really feel, only to be thwarted time and again by pesky circumstances like pregnancies, supermodel spouses and misplaced love letters.These plights are overly dramatic, but in the early stages of Rosie and Alex's non-romance it all makes some sense in the context of immature youth, a state that Collins and Claflin capture perfectly. Both in their mid-20s, the emerging British stars pass for fresh-faced high schoolers (albeit impossibly beautiful ones), and the two also nail the nervous, giddy exuberance of young love.Within the confines of this rather straightforward love story, screenwriter Juliette Towhidi (Calendar Girls) subverts what she can, and weaves in topics such as teen sex, abortion and some golden one- liners. (""A woman's body doesn't become public property because she's pregnant."") Crucially, Towhidi also doesn't reduce Rosie to a typical Rom-com lead. While driven to find love (a human enough desire, after all), Rosie breaks the moldy being a single working-class mother with good friends and an active sex life.Love, Rosie's early charm fades by the end, given that, as time (and the movie) wears on, neither Rosie nor Alex get any more mature when it comes to matters of the heart. Perhaps none of us do, but without the excuse of adolescence, these star-crossed lovers are no longer cute and, more irritatingly, they're stuck in the past. By the time Rosie and Alex get together, the sigh of relief that follows isn't because love finally finds a way, but rather that, unlike for Sisyphus, the mounting frustration can come to an end.","Love, Rosie"
159,michikawaletz,"The movie is about two childhood-friends that always got separated. When it comes to love, there always has been something in their way.",9,2 December 2017,"I just rediscovered this movie after almost 4 years and can I just say, I fell in love with it and I still am.This movie is absolutely worth-watching in my opinion, because it has a nice plot line with some twisted turns. Even though the movie is filled with romantic clichés,some jokes included and also not everything happens like you would think it will. Both leading actors did an amazing job and they have great on-screen chemistry. You really get the feeling like they would have known each other for years. The casting was absolutely successful.In conclusion I can say, that it is a movie that has some typical scenes for a romantic movie, but also some unexpected turns and the whole story of the friendship-love is beautiful to watch. It did so good, watching this movie on a Saturday evening to find calmness. It is a movie, where you start crying, laughing and smiling.","Love, Rosie"
160,zanete33,"Love, Rosie",10,12 April 2015,"In my opinion, the film was really great. I do like romance/comedy a lot, and this one is quite romantic and some parts were funny. I just couldn't wait to see the film as I actually saw them in Dublin, Ireland filming it. I just remember asking the director for the film title, and they told me it'll be love Rosie. It was awesome. I love the main characters and their roles, it felt like a real story, belonging to someone. I'm not sure if it's based on real facts, but I can relate to this story. There is no sadder moment, than realizing - you can't be with the one person you love the most. Great film and the work put in. More films like that please! :)","Love, Rosie"
161,ciarajammine,A cliché that works,10,16 February 2015,"To all the critics who gave this movie a bad review, you suck!!!! Although this movie is a cliché, cheesy and predictable, it works and what romantic comedy isn't all those things. Don't go into a Romcom expecting a anticlimax because it won't happen. Love, Rosie is funny, adorable in so many ways and of course the cheesiness that comes with all Romcoms. I personally recommended this movie for all romantics and or hopeless romantics. The actors were amazing and and to all the Lily Collins haters out there, keep your opinions to yourselves, please not everyone shares your views thanks. That goes for the Sam Claflin haters to. I'm going to repeat myself WATCH THIS MOVIE.Happy watching.","Love, Rosie"
162,lomimu,Not a RomCom,3,16 February 2020,"Lily Collins is an utter delight and the best part of this movie.I don't typically write reviews, but this was such a disappointment that I felt compelled. It's not a 'romcom' because there's no 'com' and very little 'rom'. They tried to add the usual misunderstanding/mistiming but failed miserably in the execution of screenwriting, directing and editing so the whole thing is clumsy and the opposite of charming. I love romcoms. This was crap.","Love, Rosie"
163,holly-clark103,This Film Had Me Tearing Up,10,23 February 2015,"Absolutely incredible actors. The whole story brought me to tears. I think the point when I lost all of the control on my emotions was the birth of her precious baby. Childbirth is such a beautiful experience and they really made a realistic depiction of the labor and process, which many modern movies lack and completely skip over. can't wait to watch it again, next time with family and friends. Lily Collins did an amazing job with her role, as always. I would highly recommend you watch this. I loved the song choices. Music in movies is essential and they played the perfect music for each scene. I just truly cannot say enough good things about this film. The filming was great as well, I'm not sure why it doesn't have better ratings. It surely deserves 9-10/10 in my book. New favorite! p.s. I hope they make a ""Dear Katie"" ;)","Love, Rosie"

Let's be honest, OK? We all made mistakes and we were young so don't blame the author or the director why they made them look so stupid. We were all like that and if you were not, I feel bad for you. Don't waste your time watching a movie which is made for the people who have a young and wild spirit. Ignore the sterile critic who never loved someone like those two people in the movie. SPOILER ALERT: if you read something like they were stupid to have not admitted their love, please, they were 18 years old. What could they have done? And that's why I love fhis movie so much. They made mistakes and they learned from them, that's the point. 12 years made their love stronger than anything else.","Love, Rosie"

The music sounds good (gotta buy the soundtrack!) too. And I love Lily and Sam Claflin as Rosie and Alex","Love, Rosie"
167,boikova-julia-55-107371,the scrip is already describes quite a few times!,2,6 November 2016,"Serious waste of time- bad director/ screen writer job, terrible acting in the very start of the movie and you can tell that Sam Claflin is really feeling the presence of the camera and is a little nervous.In the beginning of the movie he is already looking at Rosie like he is in love with her, i am not sure how director missed that.Lily Collins was great in that sense! I have not finished watching it- it is just so bad. Plus very pathetic sense of humor! I don't know who's idea it was, that Rosie throws up in a handbag! i don't event know what to say about his, i have just rolled my eyes very far and cant bring it back down. Shame really because it isa fun story line to base a movie on, but I think Love Me if You Dare 2003 by Yann Samuel was much better take on idea and should have been an example of much better sense of humor.","Love, Rosie"
168,kovacsagi88,Massive disappointment,3,9 February 2015,"I've never read the book that it's based on but after seeing this movie I feel even less motivated to read it.I was actually really looking forward to watch it as I really liked the trailer and I do love Lily Collins. I think she's really talented, beautiful and has great potential as an actress.About 20 minutes into the movie I got massively bored. The story to me is rather cliché but the worst part is that it doesn't really have any actual content. A 3 minute long music video has more content than this movie. It's also most times just a video montage with goofy, cheesy music in the background. It's really not well written or directed. Just your everyday chick flick. And just like anyone else I do like a good chick flick every now and then but even for that this movie was bad! Does kinda feel like they've messed up the final editing. Honestly it is a waste of time and a really boring movie. I'll never know how it got above 7.","Love, Rosie"
169,erinhkennedy1234,"Both heart warming and funny, not a care in the world that the ending is predictable",10,3 December 2014,"This movie will have you clenching your fists with frustration, laughing out loud, and welling up in the right moments and sometimes at the same time. Whenever something made yours eyes swell up with tears, something small happens to keep you from losing it and breaking down in the middle of the theatre. Rosie (Collins) and Alex (Claflin), childhood bestfriends who dance around their true feelings for each other through multiple decades, countries and partners. The story line tortures the viewers that sit on the edge of their seats, praying and waiting for the two friends to finally admit their feelings and get together. The ending (and some other scenes) were as predicted but many scenes came as a shock and really made you question whether or not it would work out. Long-delayed lovers in a visually vibrant romantic comedy, Chirstian Ditter gave the audience what they wanted after a series of twists and misfortunes. Lily Collins is as believable as an eighteen year old as she is a mature thirty year old. You fall in love with the characters, everything they go through happens to at least half of us once or twice and it proves that best friends can fall in love, that no matter how bad things are going; good things will come. It teaches us that if you love someone and nothing happens straight away, there's always hope for the future. As Phil Collins (Lily Collins' father) sung : ""you can't hurry love. No, you just have to wait"" This is by far one of the best movies of 2014, a movie that has been on my to-watch list since I first saw the trailer and it did not disappoint, if I had the money I would go and watch it everyday. Definitely one to pre- order to add to my collection.","Love, Rosie"
170,anas0,Not what i was expecting.,7,16 February 2015,"(My review is based on the movie,not the book. I haven't read it,so everything i am writing is from what i saw-like the book doesn't exist.)I found this movie here a few months ago, i saw the trailer and i was kinda excited about it. I was waiting for it and i had big expectations until i saw it on the cinema. The first 45 minutes were good but then it started getting tiring and so the disappointment started too. I felt that the screenwriter was lacking in ideas after those 45 minutes and was just squeezing her head to think of something original. I don't know about the book but the movie wasn't convincing. At least it didn't convince me.. Like, Alex and Rosie were in love with each other. Years were passing by and no one was saying anything-but everyone could see that there was something,even them but they weren't sure. Then Alex got married,twice (without thinking or maybe he was thinking that yeah Rosie doesn't want me so i'm just gonna make my life miserable) and then broke up as easily as he got married and Rosie got married too-yeah okay it was her child's father-, they tried so many things and so many times to tell each other about their love but something always was getting in the way and i felt that it started getting tiring. It was a circle. A circle that suddenly,from nowhere, broke and BAM they are together and yeah everyone's happy and they lived happily ever after. The 7 starts i gave were for the direction, the actors,the 45 minutes and something little more and for the landscapes.","Love, Rosie"
171,syekhy,i saw it coming but i kept watching,7,12 February 2015,"yes, maybe it is true that the trailer gave away spoilers which made the movie a little bite more predictable, but admit it, we kept watching. why? i'll tell you why, the story of the movie are familiar in the audience life, our life. i mean, who haven't have the experience of being friendzoned, or pretending to like someone just to make someone we really like jealous, or even wondering if we've wasted our chance to find our true love because we screwed up. love, rosie get that, the film told a story about rosie and alex, best friend who can't get it together when it comes to feelings about each other. they have to live a miserable love life because they're unable to be honest with each other, and have to wait until they're both old to finally admit, and when they do admit, the timing's not perfect. what more could you want? the film also give the audience the best ending, where best friend who love each other actually ended up together, not separated.","Love, Rosie"
172,tom-paul-bailey,Lowest denominator shoddy tosh,5,22 February 2015,"The supporting cast is a jumble of ham-heads, over playing vileness just to hammer home the point that the protagonists love is meant to come to fruition. This point alone underscores the absolute naff unbelievable absurdity of this trashy little film. That said - as way of consolation - the main actors pull off their toffy anguished tormented soul routines to at least the low standard Hollywood has set for romantic comedies; they are both watchable. The adaptation was worthy of the book, but that wasn't very hard now, was it? As the film aged, the actors apparently ceased to. Consequently, it reached a point where I thought the children of the leads would surpass their parents, and the small couple (strangely) reliving verbatim the lives of their parents, would reset the entire film, going round in a perpetual loop of worthless forgettable tripe that should have been discarded in the 90's. There are red flags signifying a dying art-form plastered all over this film, bogged down in cliché as it is. But if you're in the mood for something vapid, with a climax that will satisfy your sentimental idealism, it may well do just that, satisfy.","Love, Rosie"

And the few words,I just need to say : Don't be prejudice to films.Maybe you are not think it is enjoyable but don't judge the films.Actually love films need to be not judging because romantic films generally don't have meaning of it.But this film tell us something.If you love it,you say it.","Love, Rosie"

175,sallygames,"Amazing chemistry, a must see!",9,19 June 2015,"This movie was beautiful in the sense that it really captured the different kinds of love that existed between Rosie and Alex. It wasn't just romantic - there was a strong, special connection that existed between the two, even just as friends. It's the type of friendship that can rival any romance; the type of connection that already transcends that romance. Even just as two human beings existing next to one another, they already had so much between them; so much chemistry, tension and deep care for one another. It's crazy and touching to see, and it gets even more incredibly beautiful when it turns into romance. And I thank Lily Collins and Sam Claflin for that. They're incredible together, and I like to believe they're soul mates. Maybe perhaps not in a romantic kind of way, but in a way where there are these two human beings, living completely separate lives, who can simply come together at any moment, at any time, and create that magical type of chemistry between one another with little effort. And this connection is well shown in this movie. ESPECIALLY during those scenes of slow movement as they linger on against each other, right before an almost-kiss.The original soundtrack of this movie is stunning, and my favorite one, ""We Keep In Touch"" by the wonderful Ralf Wengenmayr, is basically, in my opinion, the epitome of Rosie and Alex.

I am really surprised that this movie has a rating of more than 3 on IMDb.under-acted by 2 non-actors, if movies are only for looks, you are better off hiring models.This movie might be worth the watch if you are cooking some food and you want some noise in the background. otherwise, please don't waste your time at all on this.","Love, Rosie"

I don't know if it's the new British feel -that I don't usually get since i watch American movies most of the time- or maybe because of simply the amazing story of this movie!

178,scheng-82181,Simultaneously idealistic yet realistic,8,26 March 2016,"For anyone who has suffered from unrequited love, the emotions depicted in the characters, as their love interest slips through their fingers every single time, is very real. Confessing feelings to someone close to you comes with a whole set of complications: rejection, timing, complacency, self-doubt, and careers. Sometimes the timing isn't right despite the fact that it's clear there's ""something"" between the two of you. Point is neither person wants to put themselves out there. This film will make you regret not taking that chance. If you've already missed your chance, or you're in a similar situation as Alex and Rosie, this film is particularly poignant. Their closeness, their sense of humour, and how they just ""get"" each other was done perfectly.In terms of acting, it's quite good. Lily Collins really surprised me. The leads had good chemistry. The only issue I had with the main characters was they were too ""perfect."" Neither of them had any serious flaws - they were both pleasant, likable, sane, and charming. The supporting characters were a bit too one-dimensional. For me, this was probably the most unrealistic part of the film. Nevertheless, I found the film to be very touching and relatable. Still some very funny moments, though it is a bit of a tear-jerker.","Love, Rosie"

As I'm sure most of you know, this movie is based on a novel Where rainbows end by Cecilia Ahern. It is just loosely based on it, because the story differs somewhat. I won't reveal anything else, to avoid spoilers. All I'll say is that it works because it captures the essence of the book. The chemistry between the two main actors is unbelievably good and the supporting cast is good as well. I warmly recommend this film to everybody. How probable the plot, that is up to a viewer to decide. It was for me. If you're a hopeless romantic, you're gonna enjoy this one. If you're a realist, you're probably gonna find certain situations a bit too much and out there. Nonetheless I left the theater with a smile on my face. The movie makes you believe that anything is possible and that one should never give up on hope.","Love, Rosie"

But I don't think any of the characters were actually American, so like a bit less odd.My only guess... One of the main stars is terrible at Irish accents.Don't get me wrong though, I still stop mid channel surf on this movie any day of the week... Because bad as it is, it's still better than the book. Now that's a sentence you don't hear every day.","Love, Rosie"
184,HoratioBlowviator,Miserable and disgustingly non-romantic,1,12 April 2019,"If you want to watch film where the two leads have no depth of character and just make shallow choices, then this is the film for you. The plot meanders joylessly and slowly declines into a predictably 'happy' outcome. Terrible messages without any substance, depth, romance or fun. Save yourself from this tragedy of a film.","Love, Rosie"

187,clara_abk,One of the best romance movie,8,17 March 2017,"The movie is about a story of best friends who move away after school, but after years, they realize that they both miss their friendship. They find out that they still like each other communicate again, until one day they meet again on the boy's wedding day. It's a really good movie to watch, when you start, you can't stop anymore, you get curious about what is going to happen, if they are going to be together or not. It's a quiet movie, to relax your mind, but really exciting!","Love, Rosie"
188,mperkovic-91598,Excellent movie,8,3 April 2017,"I am absolutely amazed with this film. This is definitely not one of the ""typical American love story"" that are nowadays too popular. Of course, there are some standard things that must appear in the genre of these films, but it is obvious that they really made an effort. During the film, you can be surprised with unexpected events that are actually much more realistic than in the standard romantic movies. The trail of missed opportunities, which is constantly repeated in this film, keeps viewers under some kind of tension, or so it seemed to me. As a matter of fact, I'm not a huge fan of romantic drama, because they put lots of unnecessary events and drama in the film, but this movie, I would definitely recommend anyone who likes movies that bounce from other films.","Love, Rosie"

190,fiorinawinarto,"Rosie and Alex keep holding on to their friendship, even though they're miles apart from each other.",10,4 October 2017,"Love Rosie. The story of two young souls begins and ends. Two teenage best friends, Rosie Dunne (Lily Collins) and Alex Stewart (Sam Claflin) is in denial about the love between them. The film was magical, everything anyone would dream about. Personally, it's breathtaking and relatable. The movie is adapted from the book Where Rainbows End by Cecelia Ahern. It is a 102 minutes movie it is not that long and not that short for a movie. It was released at October 22, 2014 (United Kingdom) and directed by Christian Ditter. The movie was amazing, how it can captures everything. The content of the movie is just compelling and somehow it makes me think as an audience, ""What if I end up like them, that the right person was right in front of me all along?"" Love Rosie might not be relatable to everyone in real life, but the way they make it, it makes me believe that the movie is myself being pictured. It is kind of pathetic, their love story. You can either see it as exciting and annoyed or boring. How Alex kept looking for beautiful perfect girl you could ever seen and at last you ends up with your best friend which may be just enough for him. He could've just say you love your best friend, instead of flying across countries to look for a better one when you're not going to find any. Finally, they end up being jealous of one and another, but worried at the same time because of their feelings. Somehow, in my opinion that what makes it interesting because it is so true in so many level.I enjoy the part where Alex got married then he have this dancing part, where Rosie's child was having the same problem like what Alex and Rosie have but the difference is that now Alex knows and wants her to feel like it is okay to fall in love with your best friend. That part of the plot breaks my heart. In the other hand I don't enjoy much where Rosie made a stupid mistake about marrying Greg because it just don't make sense, but at the same time it was the one thing that makes the movie or appealing at some point. Overall the movie is pretty sensitive and I never seen anything as good as this movie apparently. Lily Collins and Sam Claflins is definitely a perfect match to the role, but can't really tell for sure since I don't read the book but it was so perfect that they are able to make me feel like what they feel. I watched so many romance drama movies and nothing seemed to be better or slightly under either. I learned a lot after watching this, how we can't take others for granted.","Love, Rosie"
191,murphyboi-74980,A Great Romantic Comedy,10,11 October 2018,"Many romantic movies are often stereotyped as ""corny"" or unrealistic portrayals of love and life. Life is a series of spontaneous moments, difficult choices, and countless hardships. The film directed by Christian Ditter, ""Love, Rosie"" portrays growing up and experiencing heartbreaks, happiness, and sacrifices that may occur in life, through the ""semi-tragic"" love story of childhood best friends. Sam Claflin and Lily Collins play the roles of Alex and Rosie, whom are childhood best friends that are unexpectedly pushed into adulthood. Throughout the movie, we watch their individual struggles and the development of their relationship over time. When their friendship turns into attraction, they are faced with a series of miscommunications, decisions, and dilemmas that prevent them from being with each other taking the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster. ""Love, Rosie"" succeeded in showcasing the complexity of human relationships and the reality of growing up.
 I would like to think that I am a romantic, who is a sucker for all the corny and cheesy unrealistic scenarios that occur in typical romance movies. However, this movie is my favorite romantic film because unlike those other typical romantic movies, I felt that I could relate to the characters and the events or circumstances that occur in the movie. Throughout my life, I have watched countless numbers of romance and romantic comedy movies. I used to stay up late at night, just watching movies. One night, Love, Rosie came up and after reading the synopsis I decided to watch it online for free. All the other romantic movies that I have ever watched before or after, has never been able to make me lose myself while watching it. I could relate to some of the events that the characters were experiencing and it was real for me. The film appeals to your emotions with the wittiness, personable characters and the young love that they are pursuing. In addition, lessons about life, chasing your dreams, and experiencing hardship were all meticulously woven into the storyline of a ""semi-tragic"" romance. 
 This film will make you laugh, smile, and cry. For me, it hit home. I honestly cried five different times all throughout the movie. The story begins with a huge miscommunication between Alex and Rosie, leading to the series of events that follow throughout the movie. I was brought to tears every time they missed their chance because the timing was not right or something popped up that made it seem impossible for them to be together. It also pulled at my heartstrings because they love each other and they should be together, but they both think that their feelings are not reciprocated by the other. It is an accurate representation of the complications and miscommunications that can alter any relationship. The plot really emphasizes the complexity of human relationships, through the development of Alex and Rosie's young childhood friendship. 
 Life is almost never perfect. Over the course of a lifetime, there are bound to be hardships or tough situations that you may encounter. This movie portrays this well but also showcases the idea that sometimes in life you take a longer, harder path to reach the same destination. I think this movie highlights the struggles and dilemmas that may arise during growing up and becoming an adult. As well as showcases the unpredictability and spontaneousness of life and love. From this movie, I learned that life will throw anything at you, but it is important to embrace these obstacles because in the end everything will be okay one way or another. Great movies, are the ones that can make you reflect or affect people to feel something whether it be with humor, drama or romance. Overall, I strongly believe that Love, Rosie is a movie worth taking the time to watch. I highly suggest this movie if you are looking for a good cry or a just a good movie to watch. You will love it!!!","Love, Rosie"
