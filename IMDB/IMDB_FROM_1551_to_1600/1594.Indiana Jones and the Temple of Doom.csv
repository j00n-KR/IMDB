0,MartinHafer,The Indiana Jones film to avoid!,3,2 March 2008,"After the first wonderful Indiana Jones movie (RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK), it was obvious that Paramount Pictures had a mega-hit and doing a sequel that would make another fortune was guaranteed. In essence, they could even put crap on the screen and it would pack theaters--and unfortunately, that is exactly what they did! The biggest difference between the two film? Well, the first one was fun--the second one was rather sadistic and cruel. Now I am not saying there weren't some intense and possibly exploitational scenes in RAIDERS (such as the face melting finale or the temple filled with snakes), but there was a certain sadistic quality of TEMPLE OF DOOM that just looked like the writers were substituting gross-outs for intelligent scripting. Giant bugs and monkey skulls being open and eaten--complete with slurping sounds and slimy guts was neither entertaining nor needed. The same could be said for the scene where a person's heart is ripped out of their chest by the priest (also a physical impossibility unless you have the proper equipment). Throwing a cute kid into this mess of a film just seemed exploitational and mean--trying to exploit the audience's natural concerns for a poor little kid.It's no surprise that when this movie came out, the MPAA was pressured to create a new rating--PG-13 to warn families against bringing little kids to certain movies. Too bad this warning wasn't given when TEMPLE OF DOOM was released--I never would have bothered bringing people to see this mess. I did and I ended up leaving mid-way through this film because of the sick and cruel streak throughout the film. You have been warned.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
1,TheLittleSongbird,"A trifle overblown, but decent follow-up to a brilliant movie",7,3 September 2010,"On its own it is a fun yarn, but compared to the brilliant Raiders of the Lost Ark it is a disappointment. The story is rather overblown and not as well thought out, Kate Capshaw's shrill and annoying heroine is one of the least engaging characters in the series and the character of Short Round didn't do much for me either. However, the sets and cinematography once again are fabulous, as is the score. The script has some nice touches, the direction is good and the pacing is brisk. There is also some terrific action especially the wild roller-coaster ride through the Indian Mine, and Harrison Ford is still very engaging as Indy. On the whole, disappointing but it is still pretty decent. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
2,bkoganbing,An Abode Of Evil,9,13 June 2008,"For his second go around as two fisted archaeologist Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford was in China and had to beat a hasty retreat out of there with the lovely Kate Capshaw and his young sidekick Jonathan LeQuan as Short Round. Capshaw proves to be utterly useless in a crisis, but Indy has good reason to be glad he bought the little guy along.The plane he scrammed out of China on crashes in a remote part of India and Ford and his companions find themselves in a desolate and unhappy village. Two blue rocks said to have mystical power were stolen from the village idol saluting the Hindu god Shiva and someone like an eastern Pied Piper has taken all the children away. Rumor has it that the maharajah's palace has become an abode of evil. Specifically the Thugee strangulation cult which you will all remember from the RKO classic Gunga Din has revived.When Jones finally discovers what's going on and who's behind it, the last hour of the film is literally non-stop action. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is one of those wonderful films that has no message, doesn't pretend to have a message, but is just made for entertainment purposes only. It also has it share of comedy, usually from Kate Capshaw. The scene in the maharajah's palace where all those exotic delicacies are brought out and positively nauseating the audience and Kate Capshaw is hilarious. Her reactions are worth the price of renting or buying the DVD alone.The Indiana Jones eighties trilogy is currently being run on a lot of stations because of the release of the new Indiana Jones film. The Temple of Doom is certainly something not to be missed by fans of the fighting archaeologist.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
3,Leofwine_draca,"Best of the trilogy - macabre, action-packed, and exotic",10,4 August 2016,"Ever the atypical one, this has long been my favourite of the trilogy thanks to the fact that I saw it at a young, impressionable age and that its stuck in my heart ever since. Maybe it's the constant stream of action or the numerous macabre and downright horrific aspects of the tale that appealed to me at such a young age, but I still can't see why people are so down on this movie. Sure, there's plenty of unwanted comic relief, some of it stupid, but at least Spielberg still kept the sentimentalism out of his films at this stage. As a roller-coaster ride (literally too, at one point) of special effects and bad guys getting whacked, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is a fantastic popcorn movie and one that can be watched over and over.Harrison Ford had by now settled comfortably into the role of Indy like a glove and puts in an assured, wisecracking, heroic but human performance just like in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK - with the addition that he now has to act ""evil"" too after getting possessed by evil blood (see, I told you it was horror-tinged) in one scene. Aside from Kate Capshaw, saddled with a hugely grating blonde bimbo sidekick/love interest character, the rest of the cast is made up of either Chinese, Japanese, or Indians, guys who do pretty well with their respective caricatures - particularly impressive is the downright demonic Amrish Puri who glows pure evil as the bad guy Mola Ram. Kudos too to Jonathan Ke Quan as a child sidekick who isn't too annoying (compared to the similar kid in RED SONJA a year later, he's magnificent).The movie jumps from one outlandish action sequence to next, bound together by great locales and hummable tunes. A shoot-out (at the Obi Wan restaurant, a not-so-subtle joke imposed by George Lucas as executive producer) is followed by a jump from a plane on to a dinghy (!), rides through the jungle on elephant back, sacrificial rites in an underground Satanic temple, near death perils, a wild mine cart ride, and finally an outstanding finale on a rope bridge overlooking a crocodile-infested river. The special effects are very good (especially the back/forward projection during the excellent mine cart sequence), and the film enjoys plenty of in-jokes like references to the first movie (Indy's run from a flood instead of a giant stone ball, his attempt to defeat two skilled swordsman in a same manner as he did previously only to be thwarted).The horror elements include a gruesome banquet (consisting of sheep's eyeball soup, boiled beetles, snake, and monkey brains - a great highlight as a kid), mouldering corpses, creepy-crawlies, hearts being ripped out, human sacrifice, and voodoo, and also a perfect death for the chief baddie as he gets torn apart by crocs. Plus all the near-death escapes from falling ceilings and spikes in the same style as the first movie. The body count is huge, with dozens of bad guys snuffing it in one way or another, it's amazing that this was PG when a similar film like COMMANDO was strictly 18. A third film, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, followed five years later and added Sean Connery to the brew with reduced success - this is as perfect a brain switch-off blockbuster movie as you are likely to get.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
4,SnoopyStyle,"Kate Capshaw Annoying, Movie Disappointing",4,25 December 2013,"Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) escapes from gangster Lao Che in Shanghai with Chinese sidekick Short Round and nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw). They escape from the plane on an inflatable raft. They come down in India in the middle of a struggle for magical stones between villagers, the young Maharajah, and the evil high priest leading a blood thirsty cult.This is a big disappointment. Steven Spielberg is taking the franchise into ridiculous comedy slapstick action. Kate Capshaw is super annoying screaming non-stop. While the first one had a great brassy and tough Karen Allen, they're going for a blonde bimbo this time around. Somebody really needs to shut Kate up. With people shooting at them, she tosses out the gun and complains about her chipped nail. She's not only playing the blonde bimbo. She's playing it in the most cartoon way possible. Then there is Short Round. He's yet another character to create comedy. If it wasn't for Kate Capshaw's stupid character, I might enjoy Short Round's funny banter.And the story reeks of stupidity. The first one was well crafted, but this one goes beyond camp and over the edge. It borders on racist against the Indians. But even the basic logic is missing in this one. For example, if Lao Che owns the airline and got the pilots to crash the plane. Why not just return the plane to the airport? Heck why not just not take off? That kind of silliness shouldn't be excused. And I'm not even talking about gliding down on an inflatable raft. This is one big disappointment. It's one long series of ridiculous action scenes. In the end, this is a campy take on the racist early Hollywood adventures in foreign lands.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
5,mark.waltz,Appetite suppressing action.,4,1 January 2021,"This might be too much for certain audience with its overuse of thrills, gross foods that the Indian population does not indulge on, and just missing an appearance by Maria Montez as the cobra woman. This also features a leading lady who screams too much, far too concerned with her broken nails than the man who has already saved her life on several occasions. In the Chinese Graumon's Theater in 1984, I had a headache that went on for hours afterwards, and now it's like a two hour roller coaster ride, fun for the first 15 minutes, then tedious and anger inducing for the rest of it.Certainly a lot of imagination went into this sequel to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and it showed Steven Spielberg's love for the serials he had grown up with. but those were 20 minutes each Saturday afternoon, not two hours with overly loud noises that include screams, chanting, explosions, and the updated John Williams score that in the newly created Dolby was piercing.Actually even though it's not revealed in the film, this is a prequel to the previous film, not a follow-up, hence why Kate Capshaw's character of Willie is never heard of again. She's in Shanghai performing the oddest version of ""Anything Goes"" I've ever seen, going inside fantasy in a dragon's mouth then moving onto her introduction to Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones who is suddenly poisoned while meeting with Chinese gangsters. Their ride through the city is followed up by a rickety ride on a cargo plane, a that slides down a hill in the Indian mountains and ends up floating down a rapid filled river. All that in the first 20 minutes.The adventure of the story is to bring back a valuable stone to a small mountain village that has brought the town to famine and that brings them to the temple of doom, located in the bowels of a huge palace in the mountains where the town's children are being used as slaves. Ke Huy Quan as the Chinese kid who aides Ford and Capshaw is moderately cute but his spunkiness seems overplayed for laughs.It takes someone with lots of tolerance to deal with the disgusting meals served at the palace and the number of animated bugs bigger than Ford's hand, as well as the activities which take place inside the temple which involves the removal of hearts, living bodies sunk into volcanic pits and the cartoonish villain as well as the young maharajah. By the time this is over, you'll want to go to a silent place for at least an hour.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
6,kosmasp,Becoming Jones,7,29 December 2010,"Apart from the fact, that this movie does work as a prequel to the first Indiana Jones (so don't expect to see any characters from the first movie, because this works as a standalone). It actually feels like a completely different Indy altogether. And that's not only to the fact that this is more serious, rumor stating that this movie along with Gremlins might have pushed rating boundaries in the US (forcing the MPAA to come up with the PG-13 rating). In the UK it only got released in a slightly cut version (PG).Apart from that it almost plays entirely in one location (something completely unusual for an Indy movie). But it also has the trademarks of course (snakes to name but one). It feels a bit darker than the other, but does not subtract the humor completely. A weird mixture that works for some people, but puts quite a few people off too. Overall I did like it.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
7,lee_eisenberg,Detached from parts 1 and 3,5,1 December 2005,"First, I should identify that I don't hate any of the Indiana Jones movies. Each one has its merits, and if absolutely nothing else, Indy is one cool guy.Now I have to explain the problem with ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"": it hardly seems like part of the trilogy. Parts 1 and 3 had Indy (Harrison Ford) battling the Nazis trying to find a Biblical relic. This one has him accompanied by nightclub singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and homeless boy Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan), battling East Indian cultists who have stolen a sacred stone. As far as I could tell, Willie did nothing but complain about everything (was that supposed to be funny?), and Short Round was...well, you know how some kids are. Everyone does their best, but it's hard to take the movie seriously.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
8,jboothmillard,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,8,15 March 2005,"A very good second film, perhaps not as good as the first Raiders of the Lost Ark or third Last Crusade, but still a very popular one from director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan). Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) this time is not involved with German Nazis or in amongst the war, he is in India searching for sacred stones belonging to a village. Accompanied by the squeamish Wilhelmina 'Willie' Scott (Kate Capshaw, Spielberg's wife) and Short 'Shorty' Round (introducing Jonathan Ke Quan) he must go to Pankot Palace, where there is supposed to be a Temple (of Doom) where the villains stole the village's Sankara stone, which helps them get their food and water and other stuff. So he is going there to find the stones, and also free the many children that they stole from the parents. What follows is some stuff that small children may find scary, including the villain Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) who can take out men's hearts, and places people in a special cage to be lowered into the deadly pit. At one point, Indiana himself is made a villain when he drinks the blood of the God they worship, but he is revived and they get all the children out, and escape in an exciting train cart chase, oh, and collapse a wood and rope bridge. Also starring Roshan Seth as Chattar Lal, Philip Stone as Captain Phillip Blumburtt, Roy Chiao as Lao Che, A View to a Kill's David Yip as Wu Han, Ric Young as Kao Kan and Dan Aykroyd as Earl Weber. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Music for John Williams, and it was won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Sound. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Harrison Ford was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Indiana Jones was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Very good!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
9,ccthemovieman-1,Changed My Mind About This Stylish Film,8,5 April 2006,"For a long time, this was the only one of the three Indiana Jones films I did not like. Then, when it was part of the DVD package that came out over five years ago, I had to buy it if I wanted the other two, so I gave it a third look. Wow, all of sudden I liked it. For the first time, the woman (Kate Capshaw) and the young boy (Ke Huy Quan) weren't as annoying as I had remembered them. The stupid kid really had rubbed me the wrong way, but this time only Kate was annoying....and she was fine once she calmed down and got rid of the hysterics.The action in this film is mostly at the beginning and at the end. It is so Rambo-ish (bad guys never hit the target but good guys always do) it is ludicrous. It also has dumb dialog in a number of spots, paying homage to voodooism, spells and other nonsense.Yet, despite these criticisms, it's entertaining start-to-finish and has some fantastic visuals. The photography in here is beautiful: the best of the three Jones adventures. I particularly liked the opening dance number which reminded me of a Busby Berkeley extravaganza. This whole film looks spectacular on DVD.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
10,Tweekums,A flawed but fun prequel,8,14 October 2016,"This prequel opens in Shanghai in 1935 with archaeologist/adventurer Indiana Jones attempting to sell an artefact to a local general/crime lord the buyer would prefer not to pay and Indy ends up fleeing for his life with nightclub singer, Willie Scott, and his young sidekick 'Short Round'. They board a plane out of the country and head to India. Unfortunately the pilots work for the crime boss and bail out over the mountains. Indy and his friends manage to survive but they find themselves in a remote part of India. They are found by people from a remote village who ask Indy to help them recover the village's 'sacred stone' which has been stolen by a Thugee Cult based in a previously abandoned palace. When they get to the palace they receive a friendly welcome but after a strange feast things take a turn for the worse Indy is attacked and soon afterwards he discovers a secret passage which leads to underground chambers where the Thugees indulge in brutal rituals. He also learns that they have the village's sacred stone along with two others; they also have slave children digging for the final two stone that will enable them to summon the goddess Kali things are going to get very dangerous for Indy and his friends!'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was a great film so it was inevitable that Indiana Jones would return unfortunately this is definitely not as good as the original; it is still fun but those expecting something great will be disappointed. The song and dance opening is rather fun and nicely introduces songstress Willie Scott. We then get a good confrontation with a bad guy followed by an exciting chase and a series of dangers that could have come straight out of old Saturday morning serials. The action is exciting and almost none stop when it does stop we get a feast with some rather disturbing dishes and some unnecessary comic romance between Indy and Willie. The cast does a solid enough job; Harrison Ford continues to impress as Indiana Jones and Kate Capshaw is fun as Willie, a character very different to the female lead in the original less feisty, more being scared/disgusted by whatever she sees. There is a lot of action including the memorable 'rollercoaster' ride in a mine cart. There are some troubling points; I can't imagine Hindus being too impressed with worshippers of their Goddess Kali being depicted as evil; it would have been much better if the cultists worshipped a fictional deity. The film may be rated PG but there are some fairly scary moments so parents might want to watch the film before showing it to younger children. Overall I'd say that this is a fun adventure despite its flaws.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
11,ma-cortes,Thrilling action-packed and third adventure movie with Harrison Ford as the intrepid archeologist,7,5 September 2005,"The adventurer and archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) with his bullwhip wielding and hat will fight against nasty enemies in India along with an oriental little boy (Jonathan Ke Quan) and a night club Singer (Kate Capshaw who married Steven Spielberg).

12,BA_Harrison,Indiana Jones and the Irritating Sidekick.,8,27 June 2010,"Temple of Doom opens with a big musical number— classic Hollywood style—with nightclub cabaret singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) belting out 'Anything Goes' in Cantonese whilst a troupe of synchronised tap-dancers do their thing around her. It's an apt choice of song, because 'Anything Goes' is clearly Steven Spielberg's mantra for this prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark.The director has definitely gone 'all out' in an effort to top the amazing action sequences of Indiana's first cinematic adventure, and more than often the results are truly breathtaking. However, as Spielberg is prone to doing from time to time, he occasionally takes matters a tad too far, with one or two particular scenes being seriously over the top, even for a lightweight, big-budget popcorn adventure flick; this, combined with Indy's undeniably irritating sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), screaming love interest Scott, and a story hampered by maudlin sentimentality (a common Spielberg trait), means that Temple of Doom is a less satisfying ride overall than its predecessor.The good bits, however, still qualify the film as an unmissable piece of 80s action entertainment: I love the exotic banquet scene—it's just so delightfully disgusting; the sacrifice to Kali is nice and nasty (make sure you check out the uncut version for the full heart removal); the mine-cart chase is outstanding—easily the most exhilarating sequence of all the Indy films (although that jump through mid-air is one of those incredibly OTT moments I was referring to earlier); and the rope-bridge finale is spectacular (as is Capshaw, who totally rocks the 'soaking wet Indian princess' look).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
13,dbdumonteil,the worst of the trilogy,5,12 December 2003,"""the raiders of the lost ark"" was a huge commercial and critical success in 1981. So it was almost inevitable that it was followed by a sequel. This sequel was ""Indiana Jones and the temple of doom"" and sadly this is a rather poor sequel. If Steven Spielberg takes back the good old recipes that made Indiana Jones's success (exotic sceneries, entertaining pursuits, object with magical powers), on the other hand, his movie focuses a bit too much on the bloody and the unhealthy and it spoils considerably the movie. Sometimes the movie verges on the ridiculous. As a consequence, it makes the adventure movie its attraction. There's also a problem as far as the performance is concerned: if Harrison Ford is always charismatic, his partner Kate Capshaw is absolutely unbearable. A disappointing follow-up and one of Spielberg's worst movies. Fortunately, he'll catch up with the next section of Indiana Jones' adventures: ""Indiana Jones and the last crusade"" (1989).",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
14,Quinoa1984,"Spielberg/Lucas' (partly) misguided-guide to sheer cliffhanging, shamefully entertaining adventure-lore",6,13 April 2006,"(re-Review): I've never disliked this movie, but it's also been a hard movie to love over time. I also never watched it as much as I can remember Raiders, or even Last Crusade (the latter I feel like was more of a TV thing, like on the USA network). I think the two main things that bog this down are a) I don't really care all that much about the quest for the stones - as far as MacGuffins go, these are some flimsy MacGuffins, which I almost forgot about midway through the movie, and b) Willie Scott is just a terribly written character.Kate Capshaw, it should be said, isn't exactly BAD, per-say, but her character is so one-dimensional that she's not really given all that much interesting stuff to do except be the uber/quintessential Damsel-in-Distress, to the point (perhaps it was the idea?) of parody, or as some kind of ditzy sexual object. Her best scene is when she is going back and forth across the room, inter-cut with Jones talking to himself, about whether or not to leave the room or wait for the other to come to have 'mating rituals'. Oh, she CAN be annoying in her screaming and perpetual HELP ME-ness, and yet it's interesting that some people - not all, but some - are more annoyed by Short Round.To put it into Star Wars terms, imagine, easily enough, that Jones is Han Solo (and of course, both are Ford). Short Round is basically one of the droids, doing whatever to help the hero in his quest. Willie, on the other hand, is no Leia, or even a goddamn Padme. It's a flatly written one-dimensional object to follow along Dr. Jones on this mission that, in the grand scheme of things with this series, is a bit superfluous.Some backstory on the production can sometimes help; it was a dark time for Lucas as he was going through a divorce, and he poured I imagine a lot of that darkness into the depiction of these tribespeople doing their insane rituals involving torn-hearts and fires burned and so on underground. Certainly those moments where Jones is in 'evil' mode are scary - though how he just snaps out of it due to fire is just one of those 'things' you really have to suspend-to-disbelieve here. And on Spielberg's part, he's always there to work and make some craftsman-stuff, but his heart is really in a couple of the set- pieces, like the descending spikes from the ceiling in the trapped room, and of course the cart-chase.That cart-chase is a piece of icon action cinema, and for good reason; it makes the movie into a literal interpretation of what it's trying to be, as a ROLLER COASTER ride. And like roller- coasters, they're fun, they're diverting, they may be scary, and once they're over you... don't get much substance from them. So Spielberg is there to work but not fully with his heart in it (one wonders what he thought of the script on first read, from future Howard the Duck scribes Hyuck and Katz), and Lucas in a mood that is bizarre and tonally strange. What to make of a movie that has such very dark turns, and the ends with the goofiest set piece of Jones chopping a bridge so that the nameless Indians fall to their deaths as hords of crocodiles are just there already waiting.In other words, this is the most outlandish, CARTOONISH of the bunch. I'd almost like this more if it was an animated movie; ironically years later Spielberg would make The Adventures of Tintin, a kind of Indiana Jones with a kid as the hero, and that somehow is LESS cartoony than this movie with its scenes where everything is over the top. Again, it makes for a good ride, and Ford is always great as Indiana Jones - yes, even in Crystal Skull, which I don't think is as bad as has been made out to be - but it's memorable only for the ride aspect, not for its particular, shall we say, pathos.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

16,sunwarrior13,Temple of Doom:An Obvious Step Down From Raiders Of The Lost Ark,9,14 January 2012,"The second of the George Lucas/Steven Spielberg Indiana Jones epics is set a year or so before the events in Raiders of the Lost Ark.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is an adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is the second film in the Indiana Jones franchise and prequel to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. Producer and co-writer George Lucas decided to make the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains again.Arriving in India, Indiana Jones is asked by a desperate village to find a mystical stone. He agrees, stumbling upon a Kali-worshipping thuggee cult practicing child slavery, black magic, and ritual human sacrifice.After a brief brouhaha involving a precious vial and a wild ride down a raging Himalyan river, Indy gets down to the problem at hand: retrieving a precious gem and several kidnapped young boys on behalf of a remote East Indian village. His companions this time around include a dim-bulbed, easily frightened nightclub chanteuse, and a feisty 12-year-old kid named Short Round. Throughout, the plot takes second place to the thrills, which include a harrowing roller-coaster ride in an abandoned mineshaft and Indy's rescue of the heroine from a ritual sacrifice. Set years before the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun.Again you will savor the Indiana Jones schizophrenia: by day a bow-tied, bespectacled archaeologist; by night a resourceful swaggerer, whom Ford brings to life as a modern blend of Bogie and the Duke, with just a glint of misfit psychopathy in his eyes.This is the kind of movie where your date is always grabbing your forearm in a viselike grip, as unbearable excitement unfolds on the screen. After the movie is over, you've had a great time but your arm is black-and-blue for a week.It may be too ""dark"" for some, but Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom remains an ingenious adventure spectacle that showcases one of Hollywood's finest filmmaking teams in vintage form.It is still a must-see but it is an obvious step down from its stellar predecessor.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

18,hitchcockthelegend,Spielberg on devilishly OTT form!,9,4 March 2008,"Prior to the long mooted and eventual release of part 4, Temple Of Doom was often thought of as the weakest part of the series, yet it actually appears to me to be maturing nicely with age. With honest appraisal I see the only crime that Temple Of Doom can be charged with is is not being as good as Raiders Of The Lost Ark. But since few films can match that movie's classic status I find it churlish to do the second film down for it.Temple Of Doom is a frenetic roller-coaster ride, full of enough crash bang wallop fit to grace any action adventure in the history of cinema. The set pieces are pure outrageous fun; life raft escape from a crashing plane, mine cart thrill ride & a bridge sequence that is pure boys own brilliance. And while the film finds Spielberg cramming the action with a darkly sinister streak (hence the PG13 rating), we find that the fun still far outweighs any horror that junior viewers might get from certain scenes.The film also finds Ford giving his best performance as Indiana Jones since the plot calls for a more humane Jones. In fine physical shape, his witty interplay with Short Round is coupled with a textured feel of friendship that plays real well up on the screen. Kate Capshaw was always going to struggle to get close to Karen Allen's wonderful turn as Marion Ravenwood in Raiders, for where Marion was feisty and tough, Capshaw's Willie Scott is more scare-d-cat and reliant on Indy's guile to save her from peril, but she does OK and looks gorgeous into the bargain.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was a massive hit at the box-office and firmly bought Spielberg the time to then go out and make two dramas in Empire of the Sun (1987) & The Color Purple (1985). He would then return with the third Indiana film to finish what was then a marvellous trilogy; of which Temple Of Doom is the prime piece of meat in the delightful (original) trilogy sandwich. 8.5/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
19,Theo Robertson,Sequelitis,6,1 May 2005,"If THE TEMPLE OF DOOM suffers from anything then it suffers from a condition called "" Sequelitis "" . It's a condition that is in no way serious but does show that in order to infect the host ( Aka the cinema audience) the carrier ( Aka Mr Hollywood producer ) gets into a stupor of not doing anything , instead the carrier takes all the best ideas of an earlier movie and gives the host more of the same . In effect we have a movie that does not dare be different and why should it if the previous clone made the carrier a fortune at the box office . And to be fair THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is exciting and funny in parts . The problem is if you didn't like RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK you won't love this movieI've always thought Spielberg was overrated and when this movie was released he was regarded in some quarters as the greatest director of all time - A laughable assumption . The film contains some impressive set pieces but they would have been more impressive if the director had bothered to do a bit of trimming like the cart chase which goes on for too long . This especially becomes obvious when we're treated ( Though I doubt if "" treated "" is the correct word ) of a close up of Kate Capshaw screaming into the camera . This over the top humour reminded me of Spielberg's 1941 which is a very good example of spectacular humour not working . I should also point out that with the exception of JAWS I have always found John Williams to b a very average composer , and if some people consider this 1984 offering to be by "" the greatest director of all time "" then why was I unimpressed by the cinematography ? It should also be mentioned that if you were upset by the amount of violence in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK you'll also be upset by the amount of violence here but that's to be expected since this movie suffers from sequelitis",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
20,Hey_Sweden,"""Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory.""",7,11 November 2021,"The second go-round for the iconic screen character of Indiana Jones, this is actually a prequel that takes place four years before the events of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". The notorious archaeologist / adventurer narrowly escapes death departing in a hurry from a Shanghai night club. Later, circumstances have him accidentally end up in India, where he encounters hard-luck villagers whose magic has been stolen. The perpetrators are an evil cult who operate out of catacombs deep beneath Pankot Palace; Indy not only vows to retrieve a series of all-powerful stones, but to liberate the workers being abused by this cult.This viewer hadn't seen this particular entry in a long time, but it holds up fairly well. Granted, it's a much darker adventure for Indy; some people might even say it's unpleasant. For one thing, we see a victim get his heart ripped out before he is then lowered into a pit and set on fire! (The violence in this entry (along with the mayhem in ""Gremlins"") was what led to the creation of the new PG-13 rating.) It also drew some fire at the time for its portrayal of The Thuggees, a people previously seen in a little-known Hammer film called ""The Stranglers of Bombay"". If you're squeamish, you'll *also* be taken aback at the variety of ""gross-out"" gags involved in this story, including a variety of dinner items and a multitude of insects.But this viewer still had a pretty good time with it. Personally, I don't mind the darker tone, and felt that there were some excellent action set-pieces (like the runaway rail cart sequence) and cliffhanger moments. The villains (led by the maniacal Mola Ram (Amrish Puri)) are just pure nasty scum. Harrison Ford is still in extremely fine form, as the audience expects, although this time he's saddled with a terminally weak and aggravating leading lady (a spoiled nightclub entertainer played by the future Mrs. Steven Spielberg, Kate Capshaw). Some viewers additionally don't much care for Indy's childish sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), but I thought he was endearing. The atmosphere is superb in those catacomb scenes, and the production design (by Elliot Scott) and cinematography (by Douglas Slocombe) are first-rate. Once again, it's hard not to get into the spirit of things with that fantastic and catchy music from composer John Williams.Ford is very well-supported by other cast members such as Roshan Seth, Philip Stone, and Roy Chiao. He has another memorable fight with screen heavy Pat Roach, a veteran of the first film. Dan Aykroyd pops up in an unexpected cameo.Written by longtime George Lucas associates Willard Huyck & Gloria Katz, with whom he'd scripted ""American Graffiti"".""Temple of Doom"" *won't* be to all tastes, but it's a fun follow-up to the classic original.Followed by ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" five years later.Seven out of 10.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
21,Doylenf,Entertaining sequel is fast-moving adventure despite questionable moments...,6,3 September 2006,"When I asked my boss whether his kids thought the Kali scene of torture (where a priest tears a man's heart out of his body) was at all disturbing, he just shrugged and said, ""It didn't bother them."" That's an indication of how undisturbed we've become when it comes to sensibilities that have been blurred over the years as we see more and more brutality on screen. Nowadays, kids are prone to see such things without causing nightmares--but, hey, the film did get a PG rating for just such excesses of questionable taste.HARRISON FORD is again the man with the dirty fedora and this time his adventures start with a scene in a Shanghai night club where Cole Porter's ""Anything Goes"" is rendered in Chinese and where we might think we've stumbled into the wrong theater showing the wrong film. It's an extensive sequence and manages to be the best scene in the whole film, funny and wittily inventive. It's also a meeting between Indiana and KATE CAPSHAW, who plays the heroine this time, with frankly too many screaming moments--although she IS funny.The story takes a fast turn with a chase through Shanghai streets and takes many twists and turns before ending up in some kind of religious temple in the Himalayas where the Kali cult is up to no good and missing children are being used as slaves.It's all got that Saturday afternoon serial flavor--just like the first Indiana Jones--only this time the tone is a little darker, especially when dealing with the Kali cult and there's a palace meal that will churn many an adult stomach, even if the kids can take it.In fact, most kids will love TEMPLE OF DOOM--and so will most adults--but be aware it does have some gross moments of highly questionable taste.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Though ""Short Round"" wasn't as irritating as many; he was still pretty annoying and for my money makes this the weakest of the series. This film does lack the depth of casting that the other two (original) films have - Kate Capshaw is almost slapstick as ""Wille Scott"" and the story isn't so hot, either.

24,Boba_Fett1138,Dark but still very entertaining movie.,8,17 April 2004,"All of the Indiana Jones movie are very well known for their very high entertainment level. ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is no exception despite the dark undertone of the movie.Granted, that after ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" this movie might seem a little bit of a disappointment but that means in no way that this is a bad movie. Not at all.Still for some reason this movie is lacking the ""Indy"" feeling for me that both ""Raiders"" and ""The Last Crusade"" have. Maybe it is because of the absence of Denholm Elliot, John Rhys-Davies or maybe there isn't enough comedy, or maybe it is because of the fact that the movie mostly takes place at one place instead of over the entire world, or maybe it is because of the lack of a main villain, or the lack of stereotype Nazi's? Who knows but fact is that out of the so far three made Indy movies this is the worst.Spielberg still knows to create some memorable scene's, out of the three Indy movies this one might very well have the most memorable scene's. The opening dancing number, the dinner scene, the ritual scene's, the mine car chase, the famous bridge ending. Still the movie isn't the most popular probably due to the dark undertone of it. Further more I have to add that it's a shame that some of the scene's are highly unrealistic even for an adventure movie.The cast is fine. Harrison Ford really seemed to feel comfortable in his Indiana Jones outfit. Ke Huy Quan plays surprising good, mostly his types of character are annoying but he pulls of very well and the way his almost father/son like relationship with Indiana Jones is portrayed is done very well in a typical Spielberg kind of way. Kate Capshaw might not be the best Indy girl but she still provides some comical relief at times. Another actor that deserves credit is Amrish Puri as Mola Ram who has become one of the most memorable villains in movie history probably due to his weird looking appearance.Despite its darkness still one of the most entertaining movies ever made.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

I always thought it was chipping and brushing fossilized bones for months at a time and then putting together a puzzle with no picture as a reference.After spending his time in Morocco in Raiders of the Lost Ark this time Indiana Jones is in India with a cute funny sidekick and a new flame. His sidekick, Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), you may know as Data from The Goonies. His new flame, Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), I don't know what she's been in.The relationship between Indiana and Willie was very much Han Solo/Princess Leia-esque. Almost too much like that relationship. He was the aloof, cool, flippant, overly-confident man and she was the clean, kept, pretty, woman that feigned anger and indignation at the confidence and flippancy of Indiana. It would've been better if I hadn't seen it before. We all knew what direction the relationship was eventually headed: he was the star male after all.As for the adventure. It was fun. There were many death defying and still humorous situations. Through it all Indiana was quick-thinking and witty. Short Round added quite a bit of humor. The near-death situations ranged from intense to comical. As much as I tried I couldn't see the danger in being targeted by archers, especially when an arrow literally bounced off of Indiana.

Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones and the story opens in Shanghai where he enters a banquet to steal a diamond but ends up struggling to seize the antidote to the poison that was drugged in his drink. they escape by plane but the pilots depart and fuel is leaking. They land in India where they are befriended by a tribe. Jones is sent to reclaim a sacred stone that was stolen by a cult that uses their children as slaves. From there it is exhilarating action, nail-biting roller-coaster ride through a mine shaft, and an unstable bridge hovering over crocodiles. Steven Spielberg outdoes himself with tremendous action and production. Ford is terrific as Jones while Kate Capshaw provides humour as a nightclub dancer suddenly thrown into danger and a less glamorous lifestyle. Jonathan Ke Quan plays an adventurous boy who is Indy's intelligent and resourceful sidekick. Amrish Puri as the cult leader makes for a vicious villain who at one point has Jones under trance.

Raiders goes by quick, while this one has boring parts. All the action in this one takes place in the beginning or the end with not much in the middle, but a few scenes to chuckle at.  It starts great with a nightclub fight and a great plane crash sequence.  Here Indiana meets Kate Capshaw's character.  They end up in India I think along with Indiana's sidekick.  They run into a village and go to some fort or castle where a kid is king to get this stone that was stolen from the village.  There they encounter a strange cult that sacrifices people into some lava pit and the head guy there can pull people's heart out.  They also use the village's children as slaves in the mine there.

34,Wuchakk,Inferior prequel -- too comic booky and not enough substance,4,8 February 2015,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" introduced the character of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and was such a massive hit in 1981 – truly one of the greatest action/adventure movies of all time – that there had to be a sequel; or, in this case, a prequel (""Raiders"" takes place in 1936 and ""Temple"" in 1935).The opening sequence starts out in Shanghai where there's a wild brouhaha over a huge diamond in a ritzy bar. Indy escapes on a plane with a noisy singer named Willie (Kate Capshaw) and a Chinese boy nicknamed Short Round, which leads to the Himalayas and an Indian village. It's clear that they were trying to outdo the opening jungle sequence of ""Raiders"" and that's the problem: They overdid it to the point of ridiculousness. At least the first film kept an air of quasi-realism with its fun, adventurous spirit. ""Temple"" is fun and adventurous too, but the action is so out of the realm of plausibility that it becomes a cartoony farce, not far from a ""Road Runner"" cartoon. Say what you will about ""Raiders,"" but most of the action sequences were later reenacted on a TV show in order to see if they were plausible, and they were! Not so with ""Temple."" The bulk of the story takes place at the great Pankot Palace in India (actually shot in Sri Lanka) and about an hour of that in the hellish bowels of the Palace, the titular Temple of Doom. These sequences feature great sets akin to Conan the Barbarian but with a noticeably comic garnishment. This is why I scoff at criticisms of the movie as too extreme or horrifying for kids. Get Real. ""Temple of Doom"" is a rung or two above a live-action Scooby Doo cartoon.Kate Capshaw got the part of Willie out of 120 actresses vying for the coveted role. This is the film where she met her future husband, director Steven Spielberg, and they've been married since 1991. Kate's amiable and effective, but her constant screaming really starts to grate on the nerves. Yet that goes with the part; remember Indy's description: ""the worst part about her is the noise"" (lol).Despite my criticisms, there are some entertaining parts, like most of the opening, the trip with the elephants, the introduction to Pankot Palace, the dinner scene and the initial explorations of the catacombs. Parts of the ending are good too, like the cliff sequence and, later, the rope bridge. Overall, though, the story never gains the momentum or insights of the first film; worst of all, the Temple of Doom sequence goes on forever and it's just not compelling enough to sustain interest, plus it's too cartoony. ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is a prime case of too much flash with too little substance. Although sporadically amusing, it doesn't gel as a whole and is a huge disappointment after the incredible ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" The film runs (overlong) at 118 minutes and was shot in Macau, China; Kandy, Central Province, Sri Lanka; California, Washington, Arizona and Florida; with studio sets in England.GRADE: C-",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
35,zetes,"I love everything about this installment, except for Willie Scott",9,25 May 2008,"It was definitely Indiana Jones week in my home, as I watched the original three films, several episodes of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, and on Thursday (I really couldn't wait) the new Indy film. I was actually not an Indy fanatic before this week. I like all the movies, but have only seen Raiders in recent years, a few times. Temple of Doom I haven't seen all the way through for over a decade, I'd guess. The same probably goes for The Last Crusade. After reacquainting myself with the series, I have to put myself in the company of the fanboys. I loved the original series to death. Yes, even Temple of Doom. This was certainly my favorite of the trilogy when I was a kid, probably because it aired a lot on HBO and I saw it the most often. And I have to say, I almost agree with that still. Temple of Doom is probably the least perfect of the trilogy, but Spielberg is at his absolute best in his direction. I think the film has many of the most memorable moments of the series. Everything that happens in the titular temple is fantastic, the Thuggee ceremony, the fight on the conveyor belt and the mine cart chase. And the climactic battle on the rope bridge (which I never knew before was not a special effect). And the booby trap with the spikes in the ceiling and the floor, which contains my favorite Indiana Jones moment (Harrison Ford's facial expression when he tells Willie Scott that ""We are going to die!""), and the infamous dinner with the eyeball soup, live baby snakes and, for dessert, chilled monkey brains. I understand the criticisms of racism in the film, but I think the complaints are exaggerated. Maybe Spielberg and George Lucas didn't need to be so nostalgic about Kipling and Gunga Din. It certainly isn't very politically correct, even in 1984. But I don't think the depictions of the Chinese and Indian characters, most of whom are villains, do much to demean entire races. I mean, I was a kid when I first saw this, so, if anyone was going to be aversely influenced by the supposed racism it would have been me. I knew these people were fictional characters, and that even if people like them existed, this didn't represent everyone who looks like them, and even the few it might represent were long since lost in time. These movies are so pulpy, it's hard to take them at all seriously. And as bug-eyed and crazy as the Eastern characters are, the three Western characters are all wildly exaggerated as well. You don't hear many British people bitching that Captain Blumburtt made all British people look stuffy and colonialist. And in all honesty, I would rather spend an evening with Mola Ram than I would with Willie Scott! Oh, I totally agree with anybody who would say that Kate Capshaw is absolutely intolerable throughout the picture, shrieking and whining endlessly. The movie needs a woman, for sure  I think the ""five minutes"" sequence is one of the best parts of the movie, and Willie eating the apple in Indy's hand is one of a hundred images from the film seared in my mind. But they needed to tone her down, and a lot. On the other hand, I'm a big fan of Short Round, as well as Ke Huy Quan's other famous performance from The Goonies. Come on, everyone when I was a kid wanted to be Short Round (and I distinctly remember wanting to go as Data from The Goonies one Halloween). He was a kid who got to tag along with Indiana Jones! He even saves Indy's life not once, but twice, and, watching it this time, I was sincerely moved by the scene where Short Round brings Indy back to his senses and the two embrace. I really want to know what Indy did with him in the other movies (as Temple of Doom is chronologically Indy's first adventure, at least as far as the movies go).",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
36,Mr-Fusion,Not nearly as satisfying as its predecessor,6,6 July 2014,"There are various scenes and images in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM that are really cool: the big Hollywood song-n-dance/James Bond opening, the absurd life raft save, Indy's badass line on the bridge (""Mola Ram, prepare to meet Kali . . . IN HELL!"").But they overdid it on the gross-out stuff. There are plenty of bugs and creepy-crawlies all over this movie without that awful dinner scene. I think the big problem I have with this movie is that most of it takes place in/under Pangkot Palace, when the good stuff is at either bookend. It's cool that they actually went dark for the sequel to RAIDERS, but if it's not that snot-nosed Maharaja, it's some depressing child slavery stuff. Get out of the palace and back to being an Indy movie. When they actually do that, it picks back up. I have no problem with darkness, but I couldn't wait to get out of there.

38,JamesHitchcock,Indiana Jones and the Racist Stereotype,4,28 January 2011,"The eighties were probably the golden age of the sequel, and after the immense success of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" it was inevitable that there would be at least one more entry in the Indiana Jones franchise. Strictly speaking, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is a prequel rather than a sequel, being set in 1935 whereas ""Raiders"" was set in 1936. Some, in fact, have claimed that this was the first film ever to be described as a prequel and have credited its producer George Lucas with inventing the term, but this is not correct. It would appear that the word was first used in the 1950s and was widely used in the seventies to describe films such as ""The Godfather Part II"" and ""Butch and Sundance: The Early Days"".Like the other episodes in the franchise there is an opening action scene which bears only a slight connection with the rest of the film. In this case the opening scene is set in Shanghai, where Indiana narrowly escapes from an evil gangster and flees on a plane. After surviving a plane crash in the Himalayas, he makes his way into India, then under British rule, together with his two companions, a nightclub singer named Willie Scott and a young Chinese boy called Short Round. Willie, it should be noted, is a woman. In the cast list she is officially listed as ""Wilhelmina"", but the only explanation given in the film for her masculine praenomen is ""It's a stage name"". (Apparently, the character was actually named after Steven Spielberg's dog).""Temple of Doom"" is the only film in the original Indiana Jones trilogy in which the Nazis are not the villains. The main action mostly takes place in an underground temple controlled by the Thuggee religious cult, devotees of the goddess Kali, and tells how Indy thwarts the evil designs of the said cult, aided by a certain amount of help from Short Round, but none at all from Willie who spends most of the film screaming at the top of her voice.The film was highly controversial in India, the country in which most of the action is supposedly set, and the Indian government refused permission for it to be shot in their country. (The Indian scenes were actually filmed in Sri Lanka). Lawrence Kasdan, who had written the script for ""Raiders"", refused the offer to do the same for ""Temple of Doom"" because he disliked the storyline, which he described as ""ugly and mean-spirited"". Although I am not normally an advocate of political correctness, I have to admit that Kasdan and the Indian critics were right.Spielberg and Lucas have stated that the franchise was inspired by the film serials of the thirties and forties. Unfortunately, ""Temple of Doom"" also appears to have been inspired by some of the more reprehensible political and racial attitudes of that era. The Indian characters are all depicted either as evil or as weak and helpless, in need of protection from a gallant white hero. It is the sort of film about India that some B-movie producer might have churned out fifty years earlier, except that in 1934 the white hero would probably have been a dashing British officer rather than an American archaeologist. Racial stereotypes do not end with the Indians; the fiendish Chinese gangsters in the opening scene seem to be direct descendants of Boris Karloff's Fu Manchu.The film also gives a very misleading idea of Hinduism; any viewer not previously aware of the tenets of that religion would come to the conclusion that its practices include child slavery, black magic and human sacrifice. None of these, of course, form any part of Hinduism, and were not even practised by the Thugs. Indeed, many historians have disputed that Thuggee was a religious cult at all. Not all Thugs were worshippers of Kali; there were even some who were Muslims or Sikhs, not Hindus at all. Whatever their ostensible faith, the Thugs were motivated by greed rather than religious fanaticism, and they bore more resemblance to organised crime gangs than to a religious sect.Quite apart from its racist attitudes, there were other things I disliked about the film. It is notably darker than the other two episodes in the original trilogy, both in the literal sense- much of the action takes place in an underground cavern- and in the metaphorical, lacking their lightness of touch, sense of adventure and devil-may-care spirit. Kate Capshaw's Willie, always whining when she is not screaming, is one of the most annoying heroines in the history of the cinema, not a patch on Karen Allen's feisty Marion from ""Raiders"" or Alison Doody's seductively menacing Elsa from ""The Last Crusade"". (Capshaw- obviously forgiven for her dreadful performance- later became the second Mrs Spielberg.).Steven Spielberg later admitted that he wasn't happy with ""Temple of Doom"" at all, and he certainly had good cause to be dissatisfied. He has sometimes been described as the man who makes B-movies on an A-movie budget. This is perhaps unfair when one considers that he has made serious films as good as ""Schindler's List"", but there is a measure of truth in it as far as his adventure blockbusters are concerned.

The characters are memorable, the script is great, and Indiana is still pulling in the action packed excitement continuing from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The direction, editing, even the special effects are great. You have to love Short Round and Willy, the two new side kicks to Indiana's new adventure. Now I agree, Willy can get a little annoying here and there, but she was just so hilarious in that scene with the bugs and having to save Indiana and Short Round. Plus, Short Round has some of the most memorable lines of the entire series ""Okey, dokey, Dr. Jones, hold on to your potato!"", cheesy, but so funny. Harrison Ford still has Indiana down to a tee, this was the role that was meant for him.In this prequel, we start off in China on a trade off gone wrong with Lao Che, he ends up meeting a beautiful and very high maintence American girl, Willie. They escape together with Indiana's little side kick, Short Round and accidentally without knowing, they've escaped onto Lao Che's air plane. They wind up in India, where they find out about these rocks that can restore the village they're in, also the children have been kidnapped by Mola Ram and Indiana must free the kids and restore the rocks so the village can be safe again.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a fun sequel, I don't know why people complain so much about it. I can understand if people say it's the weakest of the series, but on it's own, this is a fantastic movie. It's one of my biggest recommendations to my friends as well as other film viewers. It just has everything you could want: action, romance, alligators, and heart sacrifices, lol, OK, that sounded gross, just trust me this that this is such a fun movie. It's one of my favorite films, I know that sounds bad, but I just love this film. It's a lot of fun and Indiana and Short Round are just the best buddies to watch argue on screen. This is an awesome sequel, definitely a must see.9/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
40,blanbrn,"Darker, but still a thrill ride and an action paced joy like Raiders.",8,21 May 2008,"The second film in the ""Jones"" saga titled ""The Temple of Doom"" is clearly a darker and more violent film than the original ""Raiders"" in fact some say it's a prequel as it's set one year in 1935 before ""The Lost Ark"" took place. Yet the storyline is totally different as the films clearly have no connection. However one thing is for certain with the team up again of Lucas and Spielberg the action and direction of fast paced thrills is a given joy. And Harrison Ford's performance as ""Indy"" is at it's peak best again.This time Indy has a sidekick a young boy Short Round(Jonathan Quan)also a new love interest for Jones when he meets a club singer Willie(Kate Capshaw who would be Spielberg's future wife)the trio go on a high flying adventure from the Himalayas to a fast chasing mine shaft car ride in a fortress in India. Many scenes are spine tingling as much of the film is blended with violence and voodoo that's a lot to put up with just to find a crystal stone! Overall still a good film that keeps you on the edge of your seat just like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
41,MovieAddict2016,Temple of dissapointment,6,30 July 2001,"Despite the attempts to make this film a great sequel, they ended up with a tragic try to make another Indiana Jones movie. Let me tell some of the problems I had with this film.*SOME SPOILERS AHEAD*SPOILERS* 1.-The opening scene-it was okay until Indy jumped out the window, into the car which is being drived by TEN YEAR OLD!! 2.-It just didn't fit Indiana Jones, going into a jungle was okay, but some of the things he did...just wasn't Indy 3.-The Plane-After the pilots jump out of the plane, Indy, the kid, and the girl(I haven't seen the movie in about year so I forget their names except for Indy),jump out with and inflatable raft and use it as a parachute. And they land safely on a SHALLOW stream below... I know some things are stupid and I can put up with them but THAT?!?!. 4.-The interactions-I found the girl and the boy extremely obnoxious, and although Ford was excellent as Indy, despite his failed attempts, the other actors just could not act. 5.-the sacrifice-Once Indy finds the cult in a secret passageway in the mansion he's in(sounds a bit kiddish, but that's okay, I can put up with that). He then witnesses a sacrifice made by the cult in which the leader pulls out the heart of another man with his bare hands, and then the man lives long enough to be put into a cage and lowered into a pit of burning lava, all the meanwhile still livin(WHOA, hold on here, now that's just plain stupid AND kiddish). And yet they're making this more of a kiddy movie, especially seeing a ten year old is Indy's sidekick, and now the whole heart thing. Yet they're violent enough to show the blood squeezing out of the cult leaders hand as he holds it high in the air, meanwhile the heart's still pumping!! Either kid movie or not, make your choice. 6. The mine ride-perhaps one of the dumbest parts, I'd say the third dumbest part compared to the heart and the plane parts. First the stuff they do in these mine carts is just so unrealistic. I won't even go into it it's so dumb. 7.-I could go on and on-I have a feeling by now you want me to stop before I make my comment on the bridge climax scene, but I'll tell you some things of what greatly dissapointed me.   My grandmother is almost 80 years old, she is a huge fan of the Indiana Jones series, She probably is hoping she'll be alive still when number 4 comes out, but however, she really dislikes this one, I think for the same reasons as me. I grew up on these movies whenever I'd go to her old house, I always watched number 1 and 3, 3 is still my favorite one.But I was never allowed to see temple of doom, because it was too violent. When I got older though, I finally got to see it. I wasn't exactly let down at first, but I was alot younger and well, it's like watching superman, he's the big hero. But as I got older, boy the older the more stupid it became. So I just want to say to all Indy fans, if you're die hard fans, well you've probably already seen this seeing it's been around for about 15 years I think, but if you've just become a fan, and can't wait to see the sequel....You're going to be a little let down just to warn you. So all in all, I'd have to give this 2 1/2 out of 5 stars. I hope number 4(which they are planning on making right now)lives up to the 1st and third movies, because those are the greats, and they should be shown a little more respect",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
42,DKosty123,Anything Goes & This Goes To Normal Jones Fare,6,5 December 2007,"While the action sequences in this movie seem more frantic than the Raiders of The Lost Ark or The Last Crusade, the domination of them is to cover a weakness in not only the script but the heroine. Kate Capshaw does not thrill me in this role here. I think she is the weakest actress in the series. Unfortunately, she is the most dominate woman in any of the films appearing more than any other which sinks this film to ordinary.Harrison Ford is pretty much his usual Indiana. A lot of the scenes were shot inside a massive cave complex which detracts from the film as well. This turns out to be Spielbergs bridge from the first to third film much like The Empire Strikes Back was for George Lucas in the Star Wars series. While your heroes are here & there is plenty of action, it leaves you a little flat from the first film.Out of the films in this series, this one is by far the weakest.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
43,lasttimeisaw,Spielberg expertly anchors a roller-coast journey for Indy and company,7,4 October 2015,"Finally catching up with the second instalment of INDIANA JONES franchise from the very first time, over three decades, it surprisingly doesn't feel dated, on the premise that if one can disregard its shameless exploitation and derision of the exotic Indian culture (cuisine) and religious belief, which has become a normalcy for the ever-avaricious industry.After an efficient prologue in Shanghai 1935, where a deal routinely goes awry between Jones (Ford) and the local crime boss Lao Che (Chiao), he is dumped airborne (thanks to a ridiculously fanciful utilisation of an inflatable raft) from a crashing plane to Northern India with his sidekick, a 11-year-old Chinese boy Short Round (Quan) and a saucy night club singer Wille Scott (Capshaw), whom he just met. Contrary to the present trend of globe-trotting in the adventurous blockbusters, Spielberg sticks to a simple plan for the trio, which is to retrieve a sacred Sivalinga stone stolen from a destitute village, by the evil forces dwell in the nearby Pankot Palace, lead by the high priest Mola Ram (Puri), who possesses 3 of the five Sankara stones (the Silvalinga one included), conducts the human-sacrifice ritual to the goddess Kali (which is a huge blasphemy towards Hindus), also exploits child labor to mine for another two stones.Spielberg expertly anchors a roller-coast journey for Indy and company, once the trio enter the secret channel inside Willie's room, booby traps, mind-controlling potion and a man's heart being ripped out the body while still remains alive, rather a grisly image for a PG picture, it is also a plot device doesn't get further explanation in the thrilling cat-and-mouse chase, which unfortunately backfires when Scott is put in the same fate but her heart is wondrously exempt from such a gruesome treatment, thanks to the inattentive script-writing. Then come the famous chase scenes on a mine cart, still a thrilling ride even we have already seen a more grandiose upgrade in THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY (2012). Finally, a face-off on a rope bridge with crocodiles waiting for their quarries to fall from the sky, all the set pieces mesh together adequately, so as a whole, it is a valid commodity produced with the cutting-edge technology in its era.Ford is a charming chap in his utter prime, an omnipotent hero image with vast appeal, he can fight vigorously, banter casually, and seduce effortlessly. Capshaw, the future Ms. Spielberg, is typified as an impudent, priggish and whiny westerner dragged into a foreign country, waiting to be astonished by the exotica and scream from the top of her lungs, a cheesy eye candy serves as Indy's love interest and a laughing stock, which prompts one wonder why in general, there is rarely any recommendable female characters among all Spielberg's works? Jonathan Ke Quan , sports a fluent American English, but supposedly a Chinese boy from Shanghai, is literally the game- changer in the film, it is him who miraculously comes to Indy's rescue not once but twice in the crunch (no matter how inane it is) and never retreat from the front-line (even though it is hard to buy his posturing kung-fu deftness), together with Ford, they clink a strong father-and-son rapport, he should be the bona-fide successor of Indy's legacy and audacity, far more qualified than Shia LaBeouf in the dismal INDIANA JONES AND KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (2008, 6/10), his real blood heir.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
44,disdressed12,much darker than Raiders,7,15 June 2008,"i enjoyed this prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark,but not quite as much.it's not as action packed,but there still some impressive action sequences,most of which take place during th last 40 minutes or so.and there are some great death defying moments,as well.there's much more tension throughout than in Raiders.as well there are more comic bits in this one,which is good because the overall tone of the movie is pretty dark,dealing with mysticism and superstition.this installment is a bit slower,but not boring.and i liked the story more.it's a bit more developed.Indy gets too sidekicks in this one,a young Asian boy and a Nightclub singer,which provide much of the comic relief.when you add everything up,it's still a pretty gun time. 7/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
45,KineticSeoul,Well...It still captures the spirit of Indy.,7,7 January 2017,"With the success of the first one and the intention of making sequels before the first installment. It wasn't really a surprise that this sequel came about. Spielberg decided to direct the first Indy movie because Lucas told him the script to the sequels has already been written. I will say that despite this not being a classic, it does somewhat captures the spirit of Indy. The plot takes on a deeper tone, but the whole thing just didn't feel as adventurous or mesh together all that well. The humor doesn't work as well when it comes to complimenting the scenes. Instead it just seemed like it was forced a lot of times to take the attention off the dark tone. It was nice to see Indy again and it's trademark theme song. But it just seemed like a generic adventure with average set pieces. The mine cart chase scene is pretty awesome and I could tell a lot of work went into it. The bridge scene also did a good job of bringing out the character of Indy. I also thought his team up crew composed of a nightclub singer Willie and a young Chinese boy called Short Round was a nice touch. Even though the character Willie can get annoying with her brat like and klutzy behavior, she somewhat won me over at the end. Anyways despite this not being a classic, it's not a bad movie. It just didn't capture the essence of the previous one, nor did it flow in a very entertaining and immersive manner. It just lacked the realism and authenticity, but came about as a more gruesome and mature Scooby-Doo special. And felt like I was watching Indy go through a theme park ride instead of him going on this grand adventure of exploration. Overall, this is still a good movie but kind of disappointing for a Indy installment.7/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
46,OllieSuave-007,Funny Indy Adventure!,9,15 June 2007,"Harrison Ford is back as Indiana Jones in his first sequel to to the original Indiana Jones movie, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Jones teams up with nightclub singer ""Willie"" Scott (Kate Capshaw) and twelve-year-old Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan), and they journey to an Indian village where the people believe that evil spirits abducted their children after a sacred stone was stolen. In the mix is Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), who wants all the stones to create a superpower. George Lucas, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz provided a great story and screenplay that made this film a thrilling adventure that includes boobie-traps, mine-cart rides and black magic. Action is in abundance here, from the Shanghai car-chase involving Indy and Chinese gangsters to the battle royale involving Indy and the slave-traders. This film is more exotic and danger-filled than the other films in the trilogy, which makes it my favorite and one that will provide you with non-stop entertainment. Steven Spielberg did a great job directing, keeping the plot's momentum fast-paced, and John Williams provided a marvelous music score, giving us catchy themes for the mine-cart chase and the iconic Indiana Jones theme, which would be forever recognizable in the cinema world. Indiana Jones had great chemistry with Willie Scott, and a touching friendship with Short Round, providing a nice balance of romance and drama in this adventurous film. I especially liked Kate Capshaw's hilarious role - the parts where she gets thrown off by an elephant and where she skirmishes at the food served in the Indian Castle were classic and provided a nice touch of comedy. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round gave a feisty and comical performance, yelling at Indy and Willie when danger is near. Amrish Puri makes a dark and frightening villain, and Harrison Ford as Indy gave us another action-packed, whip-cracking and dramatic performance. Great fun here. Not to be missed.Grade A",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
47,thesar-2,Anything GoesDown and Fast,4,11 April 2011,"Oh, if I ever want to make it in Hollywood or get into (the movie business type of) bed with Steven Spielberg, I better not say the followingand I am resistingbut I can't help it: Kate Capshaw nearly destroyed the Indiana Jones franchise.Let the flood gates openShe was AWFUL! She was the Jar-Jar of Indy's adventures. She was the Cousin Oliver of the series. She was comic relief no one asked for.Dr. Jones's second episode: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom wasn't great to begin with, heck, it's 50 steps below the original masterpiece, Raiders of the Lost Ark, but let's add in the most annoying female lead/sidekick since Sylvester Stallone shouted: Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot!Too harsh? And I love(d) Estelle Getty – a great and golden girl.Fine, forgetting the ""Willie"" (Mrs. Spielberg's character), the movie is all-but a cartoon adventure and contains more ""family"" orientated scenes than the deeper first installment. And yet, they also thought it would be a good idea to throw in enough grotesque segments to further the ""PG-13"" movement. Eh. Make up your mind.Also, with the enormous success of Raiders, they decided it was an appropriate time to tone down the special effects and budget. Huh? Where Raiders contained one unbelievable scene of FX – the finale of claymation – Tempe of Doom contained dozens of more laugh-out-loud scenes, including, but not limited to: water pouring out of the side of the mountain and the little, tiny dolls in the ""roller coaster"" scene on the tracks. (Side Note: That happened to be one of my favorite scenes in the film, though I have to look away when the characters appears as toys instead of humans.)Let's fast forward a bit, leap frogging over the enormously superior follow-up/make-up third installment and realize, even though how much of a letdown this film was, it could be worse: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull – the long-overdue sequel few asked for and those who did regretted it.That leads me to wonder: was this movie a complete waste, as it all-but indicates above? Honestly, no. In addition to the always-excellent score by John Williams, the opening was grand – I absolutely loved the number the aforementioned disappointment Kate sang: ""Anything Goes."" I liked the gun vs. sword follow-up gag, even though this is a prequel – still, it was a nice homage. And believe it or not, even ""Short-Round"" (Jonathan Ke Quan) was a needed and real comic reliefespecially when Willie was such a dud.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) gets dropped (LITERALLY) into an adventure involving an evil man's quest for 5 glowing stones to, well, what else? to RULE THE WORLD. You see, just one magic stone can harvest and flourish an entire village, but that, along with all the children have been stolen to find the two final stones in order to complete world dominance.That's a quick synopsis. And another reason I didn't care for this movie all that much – aside from the bad aftertaste you'll get if you watch the first two simultaneously. I liked (in Part One, Three and Four) the fact that Indy does his research and willingly goes on a trek for (insert human or artifact here) VS simply crash landing into a ""mission.""After that wonderful opening I mentioned, Indy's escape plane he took when he's chased by greedy business men crashes and the Stone-Less tribe begs him to find the Stone to return the tribe to greatness. OH, and to possibly bring back the kidnapped offspring. If he has the time.It's a weak excuse to get Indy into action. And it's even more unbelievable on how Willie ""has"" to tag along. But, be that as it may, it still has some fun action/adventure sequences such as Short Round and Indy being trapped when Scream-Queen Willie is ""bugged"" out by having to, oh, I don't know, rescue them.This movie is literally for kids, namely ones that don't appreciate the first masterpiece and the excellent follow-up (only #3, The Last Crusade, that is.) It's a live action cartoon adventure that's best served with no-Indiana Jones knowledge prior to going in. It's like watching Die Hard 2: Die Harder before you explore John McClane's excellent other adventures.Side Note: Since this doesn't have to do with the quality of the film, I'm mentioning it here: One of my all time favorite video games growing up was the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom arcade game. I played it constantly, alongside Tron. And I played the Indy game before I actually saw the movie. So it got me pumped for the score, and the quotes, such as ""We walk from here"" and whatever the bad guy says. So, now, when I watch the movie, I do get a nice sense of nostalgia when I heard the score and lines. Unfortunately, that doesn't make a better movie, but it sure as heck reminds me of a simpler and fun time of my life.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
48,cherold,If only this movie had fulfilled the promise of it's first 15 minutes,5,14 September 2013,"Temple of Doom begins with two of the best set pieces of the Indiana Jones series, a delightful Busby Berkeley-esque musical number and a frenetic scene involving an antidote, a diamond and some ice cubes. They're light-hearted and beautifully done, and for the first 20 minutes, everything in the movie suggests a fun, frolicsome adventure of foreign intrigue.And then it all falls apart.The problems start when Indy and his companions arrive in a blighted Indian village. The change in tone is striking; suddenly the movie is a grim story of suffering villagers, their lives in ruin, desperately begging Indy to help them (oddly enough their main concern is a little stone, although he soon learns they are missing something that most people would consider far more precious). From here, the movie drifts into eyeball soup, giant bugs, human sacrifices, and child slavery. While there are some good scenes, particularly towards the end, where there is a exciting mine cart chase that could easily fit in with that first 20 minutes, the movie is generally not good at all. The story is poorly structured, the dialogue is weak, and the romance between Indy and Kate Capshaw is forced (she's whiny and he holds her at knife point in the first scene; how is that a good start for a relationship?)Apparently Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas had just been divorced and were feeling depressed, which would explain both why they decided to pursue such dark subject matter and why Capshaw's character is so shrill and inept that I felt embarrassed for the actress (especially since she had to follow Karen Allen's strong character from the original). Light adventure is not the venue for working out your unhappiness. The writer of Raiders of the Lost Ark actually turned down a chance to script this movie because it was so unpleasant, and that should have given Spielberg and Lucas pause, as should India's refusal to let them film there because they felt the movie was racist. These complaints seem justified; the movie is a mix of weak Indians who need a white man to save them and evil Indians that need a white man to stop them. If only I could clip the first 20 minutes from the movie and plant it like a seed and let a two-hour movie in the vein of that beginning grow in place of Temple of Doom. This movie isn't just mediocre, it's also tragic; it's the movie that might have been.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
49,Robert_duder,The film that truly made Indiana Jones the adventure Masterpiece...BRILLIANT!!,10,18 March 2008,"When people say Indiana Jones I think this is the film that comes to mind. While Raiders started the amazing series, and Last Crusade wrapped it up and took it to different heights...Temple of Doom IS Indiana Jones, it's everything the character stands for an gives people in entertainment. Terrific adventure, jaw dropping action, brilliant sets and exotic locales, larger than life characters, violence, darkness, romance, and wicked villains all balled up into this mysterious history lesson not based on reality. Many people that grew up in the eighties will fondly remember Temple of Doom as their favorite film and it's easy to see why. This film is the pinnacle of adventure...unparalleled by anything else right up to this day. Spielberg and Lucas have said that they longed to make Indiana Jones as an homage to the 1930's and 1940's serials and again Temple of Doom really does fit that bill. Indiana Jones in general and even more so Temple of Doom almost has this campy feel to it but you never once think of it as campy because it is incredible adventure. Steven Spielberg returns as director and George Lucas returned as writer for the story and the two of them know these characters and Spielberg just seems to have this innate knowledge of how to entertain and Temple of Doom turns in one of the greatest performance in an adventure film let alone a sequel which blows away it's predecessor.This series would have died dead in the water had Harrison Ford not returned. Ford IS Indiana Jones, everything about him just completely embodies the character. His rugged, tough talking, intelligent portrayal is mind blowing and if he got comfortable with the character in Raiders of The Lost Ark, he completely honed the character in Temple of Doom (which technically takes place before Raiders.) He is awesome, and one of my favorite actors but also gives us one of the greatest characters in movie history. Kate Capshaw is Indy's love interest and she is the complete opposite of previous love interest and his later ones and that is what they wanted. As lounge singer 'Willie' she is completely out of her element, whiny almost but it works for the story. I almost find her overused and overplayed but not quite as her character just jives with the story. Jonathan Ke Quan...what can I say...one of my favorite sidekicks in movie history as Indy's little partner Short Round. They give him a tiny bit of background but still leave his past kind of a mystery but still gives Indy this softer side and the two of them are terrific together. Ke Quan is awesome and just a really good addition to the story and gets some great lines. Amrish Puri is one of the film villain greats as the evil Priest type character Mola Ram.So many Indiana Jones fans have listed Temple of Doom as their least favorite in the series and that stuns me. I mean the film starts in a Chinese lounge with a musical number that makes you wonder if you're watching the right film...next thing you know you're in a high speed car chase across China, on to a plan that is going down, into a raft on a high speed river, into a village pillaged by evil, into a temple of the strangest religious practices...the film is brilliant. I could watch it a million times over and it will be my favorite Indiana film. If you only force yourself to watch one Indiana Jones film...well you're crazy...but if you do, make it Temple of Doom because this film is what Indiana Jones is all about...adventure. Granted there are some key elements I think missing from the series that the other two have but being a technical prequel it's understandable...first of all you have no Marcus Brody (played by Denholm Elliott), and Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies who are small but pertinent characters to the Jones films. Also the supporting characters like Willie and Short Round are a little more used than most supporting characters but Temple of Doom is just fun and by the far the darkest in the series. I was almost blown away by how dark and gritty and violent Temple of Doom was compared to the others but it works for it. Definitely my favorite in the series. 10/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
50,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Ah, so this is what the Indiana Jones films are about?",8,14 February 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Indy's back, this time kicking off by ticking off a Japanese warlord over a drinks table. This results in a car chase through the streets, then in the sky, before a crash landing in poverty stricken India that results in him going off on a quest to find a mystical stone that was stolen from a village. But Indy's got some excess baggage coming along for the ride, in the shape of an un-co-operative, moody lounge dancer (Kate Capshaw) and a really bratty Japanese kid he saved from the streets.With the 'classic' original film coming out two years before I was born and the sequels just ending up sort of floating by the by, the Indiana Jones films ended up being ones I ended up getting into later in life. But having seen the original all the way for the first time last night, and now giving the sequel a go tonight, I could see what kind of films they were meant to be, with it copying the original's style of 'opening in the action.' They are real 'boys own' films, all about the flash and spectacle, but what flash and spectacle. This sequel boasts some truly terrific, brilliantly filmed action sequences that couldn't fail to satisfy the most demanding of action fans. You'd have to see them to believe them.As for the performances, Ford just does his usual grumbling tough guy act, Kapshaw just waves her arms about and shrieks a lot, in a role that looks pretty degrading and beneath her for roles she'd do later in her career and the bratty kid is, well, really bratty. Don't expect much in the way of depth, but if you want grand spectacle and adventure, you've definitely come to the right place. ****",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
51,ElMaruecan82,When sequel and excess makes success ...,7,7 March 2014,"There's not one ounce of believability in any of the frames from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", no situation we can relate to, no credible character. Yet what sounds like a weakness might be the film's greatest asset and what most contributed its success, besides the name of the director, the titular hero and the fact that it was the second opus of the highest-grossing film made three years before.""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is perhaps the most cinematic movie ever made, and it's not surprising that Steven Spielberg directed it, the fans will love him and the haters will hate him even more after watching ""Doom"". Of course, chances are that the fans would still prefer ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but why? Was it more realistic or less fantastic? Was the portrayal of all the Germans as cruel and cunning Nazis more acceptable than Hindus as monkey-brains eaters or Satanist-cult followers? No, sir, if ""Doom"" has at least one merit is to confront the fans to the fact that ""Indiana Jones"" is a series not to be taken seriously.And Spielberg follows this pattern with a delightful sense of excess, to the point that the film constantly flirts with parody. Indy is cooler and funnier, the obligatory female element incarnated by the screaming nightclub singer Willie (Kate Capshaw) whose status set the fights of feminism many decades back (thanks 'Watchmojo') and Round-Trip, the Chinese boy, a sidekick who could have been an annoying comic relief if it wasn't for his heart-breaking ""I love you, Indy"" near the end. Spielberg was dying to make an adventure of ""Tintin"", but before the dream would come true 27 years after, and because of the passing of Herge in 1983, his reference to Tintin's friend Chang was his wink to the Master.And I like to see Round-Trip (rememeber, he was the geeky Data in ""The Goonies"") as Spielberg's allegiance to Tintin, to Herge's paternity, although there was already some Tintinesque stuff in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". But ""Doom"" borrows more from the earlier Tintin's albums: the mission, set in India, is rather simplistic, taking back a sacred stone stolen from a village of poor peasants, who lost all their children in the process. Indy discovers later that they were enslaved in a mysterious temple ruled by an evil Thuggee priest. Indeed, even by Tintin's standards, the film is rudimentary. But at least, it never lies about its premise. Right from the beginning, in Shanghai's ballroom scene, the film shows some glimpses of comedy and even slapstick totally absent from the first film.It's pretty obvious that Harrison Ford grew more confidence toward his character, as he did with his no-less iconic Han Solo. Ford portrays Indy as if he knew he was exposing his aura to a group of old friends who missed him after a three-year absence, and this is exactly what Spielberg does. The references to the first film includes also the hat signature shot, I would have loved to see a parody where the hand gets crushed under the door for once. And right near the end, Jones tries to reprise his gun' trick against the evil Army, until he realizes he has no gun, it doesn't work but the gag does. The comedy is really a relief after so many actions scenes, and 'Indiana Jones' is a character that can't do without comedy. It's the alibi of its deliberate campiness.But this leads me to the key element that make the film worth to watch, an abundance of action scenes, it's like ""Aliens"" for ""Alien"", it simply never stops, apart from a few romantic interludes or the infamous dinner scene meant to let the viewers catch their breath or digest their popcorn, (well, I don't think they'd eat anything during that part) the film is pure thrills from beginning to end, from the snow sequence to the cart mine chase, with a longer trip in the disturbing temple, that might discomfort some younger viewers. If not the best, ""Doom"" definitely deserves the title of ""creepiest"" movie of the franchise, establishing Spielberg's craftsmanship when it comes to inspire us very specific reactions.I had the feeling that the film was maybe too intense but after a second thought, I understood the following point, since it's deprived from any intellectual substance, ""Doom"" couldn't be anything but an action film, and Spielberg knew that. A character like Willie, whose existence is due to Spielberg's marriage with Kate Capshaw, had only one purpose: being saved by Indy (and saving his life once) therefore, danger had to be everywhere, but I wonder if he wasn't tempted to let her drop in that mountain of lava. At least, Round Trip had some skills, and we'll never thank him enough for saving Indy.Anyway, ""Temple of Doom"" is the film the word 'spectacular' has been invented for, it's very telling when the most impressive action sequence isn't the climax, although the bridge scene is pretty memorable, it wasn't as thrilling and heart-pounding as the escape on the cart mine with the water playing the role of the infamous boulder. Roger Ebert called it a 'forearm bruiser' referring to the fact that your girlfriend would grab your arm several times, well, I didn't see in the movie theaters, but I understand why the film was the highest grossing. The rest of it, analysis of accuracies and all that stuff is just as superficial and futile as the object of their accusation.Again, would you take seriously a film whose final gag is an elephant splashing water at a kissing couple? It's obviously cartoons' stuff, but that's what ""Doom"" is, a great live-action cartoon, and just because it doesn't have the pretension to be anything else, I give it a slight edge over ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
52,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Jones. Indiana Jones.,7,3 February 2020,"This prequel to 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)' is often maligned for its darker tone. This, however, isn't really the issue. 'Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom (1984)' simply isn't as good as its predecessor, structurally or narratively. It is, however, a solid action flick with a unique setting, a strong sense of style and a charismatic and vulnerable lead. It's usually entertaining and always well-crafted, palpably blending visual effects with real stunt work. The picture has its problems, though. It sags quite a bit in its midsection, suffers from a strong sense of 'white saviour' and features an annoying, unnecessarily useless, constantly screaming side character. I am, of course, referring to Willie, whose representation does no favour to anyone. Thankfully, Short Round provides more than enough enjoyment to compensate for this, and Indy himself is as charming as ever. He is a bit more 'Bond', though, which was the initial intent for the globe-trotting adventurer. Frankly, this isn't as interesting as the more bookish bloke we got before. Neither is the plot, which somehow doesn't feel as tight despite the fact that it literally starts mid-adventure and never gives the heroes a chance to 'return to base', as it were. Despite its issues, the piece is iconic and exciting. When it gets going, it provides all the extended action splendour we've come to expect and it does it admirably. It's fun, fast-paced and painful. The overall affair may be the weakest of the original 'Indiana Jones' trilogy, but it's still better than a good chunk of similar fare. 7/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
53,bowmanblue,As deserving in 'Indy lore' as its predecessor and successor,10,9 October 2014,"I watched The Temple of Doom when I was seven and loved it. Maybe that's why I still love it today. However, every time I look on the internet I see people who seem to think that The second Indiana Jones story is somehow sub-standard to Raiders and Last Crusade (notice how I don't even mention Crystal Skull - which I reasonably enjoyed too).I disagree. I'd say the main difference between Temple and what went before and (directly) afterwards is the lack of a military presence and some good ol' fashioned Nazi-bashing. Instead, the action largely takes place in one setting (i.e. the Temple of Doom itself) and there's no mention of Marcus or Indy's other professors. Therefore, apparently this goes some way to distance itself from the others, making it appear like more of a 'stand-alone' movie. Plus, and maybe you don't know this, it's also (technically) a prequel to Raiders, taking place before the first film.Also, be prepared for lots of screaming. Indy is accompanied by a female sidekick called Willie who does little else but cry out for help throughout the whole film. Some people have even likened her performance of that of Jar-Jar Binks in how much she irritates the viewer.However, I ignore all these points and simply love it for a good old-fashioned tongue-in-cheek (slightly) action romp. Harrison Ford is as good as ever and the music adds to the effect and gets your heart racing every time Indy's 'theme' comes on.Yes, it may be slightly out on a limb if you compare it to Raiders and the Last Crusade, but don't treat it any differently. Does anyone really think Indiana Jones ONLY fights the Nazis? There are plenty of bad guys around the world who need a good whipping!

He travels to the Far East to steal the Ankara Stone and rescue a group of enslaved children from an evil cult. The aspect that lowered my rating is the acting. Harrison Ford is great as always but Kate Capshaw is a bit annoying. She screams way too much for my liking. The Chinese boy is not bad. It's just hard to understand him. The action is great.

But little does he know the plane he gets on is owned by Lau Che and the pilots sneak out in mid-air while they are sleeping.After jumping to safety in an inflatable dinghy Indy, Willie and Short Round drift by an Indian village that has been stricken with bad luck since the theft of their magical Shankara stones. Encouraged by the villagers to go to Pankot palace and retrieve the stones, Indy has no idea that what he will find involves an evil cult hellbent on taking over the world with their lunatic new religion.Temple of Doom is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best Indiana Jones film. I know a lot of nerds are going to disagree with me but I do think it superior to Raiders of the Lost Ark because I prefer the darker, nastier tone and the fact that it just doesn't let up from the word 'go'! Two hours of Temple of Doom's running time pass in a breeze of sheer adventure as Spielberg takes us from one memorable set-piece to another. The opening musical number, the fight in the Obi-Wan Club, the chase through Shanghai, the plane crash/dingy ride, the journey to Pankot Palace, the dinner scene, the human sacrifice, the freeing of the slaves, the mine-cart ride, the water rush, the rope bridge, the cliff-hanging...wow! How much more can you pack into a film? It's physically impossible!Originally criticised on it's release for being too dark, Temple of Doom still ends up being a classic. I guess the audiences of 1984 were expecting Raiders of the Lost Ark 2 and were taken aback when they got something else. If you watch it with the others you can feel how different the film is with no scenes taking place in America, no University and no Sallah or Marcus Brody.John Williams' brilliant music is also at it's best. He even received an Academy Award nomination despite already being nominated for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, which is quite rare. The film did win an Oscar for its visual effects (beating the equally impressive effects of Ghostbusters) which, when viewed today, at least might seem a little bit dated, but still hold up quite well.Or course, there's nothing really important about the film.

It retains the technical qualities and spirit of the first film, but this time the dramatic elements of the film fall into the background, and preference is given to an adrenaline action roller coaster that does not slow down almost throughout the film. Spielberg strings impossible situations at such speed that you get dizzy and, although this overdrive is quite fun, it builds a frivolous atmosphere which, in combination with the amount and type of humor in the film, leaves the impression of a parody.

61,ironhorse_iv,This movie fails to keep up with the Jones. It's my least favorite movie of the Indiana Jones original trilogy. Still it's lots of popcorn fun.,7,1 February 2015,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom isn't sinking. It isn't crashing! It's just mediocre alright. I have to say, while the movie is very campy, have a darker tone, and takes itself more seriously than it needs to; it's a lot better than the overused CGI mess that was 2008's Indiana Jones & the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Directed by Steven Spielberg, and co-written and product by George Lucas, the movie is the second installment in the Indiana Jones franchise and a prequel to the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark. Set in 1935 India, the movie tells the story of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), who find himself being ask, by a desperate village to find a mystical stone that will help rescue their missing children. He agrees on it, and he goes one on one, with a ruthless Thuggee cult. Can Indiana Jones stop them or will the cult continue to kidnap the children of India for child slavery? Watch the movie to find out! While, this movie is beloved by most Indy fans, the movie is not, without faults. Without spoiling the movie, the movie has some of the silliest scenarios, the stupidest lines, and the most obnoxious characters! Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) has to be one of the most annoying female characters, ever made. I really can do without the force romance between her and Indy. It was bit too much. She's unbearable! She always whinny, complaining and screaming. She never shuts up. I don't know why, the writers for this film, thought this would be funny. Every time, she's b*tch. I want to turn off the film. I really can't stand her, useless damsel of distress persona. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round, Indiana child sidekick wasn't so bad. I just wish, he didn't shouts almost every single one of his lines. I don't know why Indiana is hanging out with a child, but whatever. I like Amrish Puri as Mola Ram, the villain. He was very sinister. Most of the other supporting cast were alright in their roles. It was cool to see Dan Akyroyd in a small cameo. Most of the characters were a bit too cartoony. The movie was temporarily banned in India due to its offensive representation of their culture and its religion, Hinduism. That dinner scene with the over the top, Indian stereotypes was a bit culturally insensitive. I'll give it a pass, because it's based on the 1939 Gunga Din mixed with 1954's Secret of the Incas and those films was pretty incorrect when it comes to foreign cultures, too. The movie was also criticized for promoting the concept of a white savior rescuing Indians from the clutches of an Indian villain. I don't see anything, wrong with that, because it has Asian characters helping Indy. Like the previous film, the movie has a lot of creepy scenes and visuals. Seeing a guy get his heart rip out his body and then torch was very crazy! Some people might also find the children being slaves, a bit too disturbing. The film got heavy criticism for its violence, but in my opinion, it's not as bad, as Raiders of the Lost Ark in the use of blood and gore. The first film was a large part of the reason the PG-13 rating was created in the US. Another problem of the film is the action. I like most of it. The bridge and mine cart scene were fun, but when it comes to being realistic and logic, it was mostly a miss. The worst had to be the flying raft scene. Its goes way beyond any realm of plausibility. It was a bit distracting. I always, wonder why didn't the pilots just stab, choke or shot them on the airplane. It would had, save them, a lot more time. They conveniently fly them all the way to India, just to jump out of the plane in the middle of nowhere? I guess, they don't care about their cargo, nor the fact, that they jump out of the plane to a snowy wasteland. Let's see, how long, those pilots are able to survive in the mountains. It was stupid. The musical number at the Shanghai nightclub was also jarring. I don't know how a giant soundstage was able to be put in that small restaurant, but that just nit-picky. One of the biggest gap of logic is how this film is supposed to be a prequel to Raiders, but yet none of the characters return, and Indy would still later scoff at the suggestion of magic, despite seeing clear evidence of its existence in this movie. That one is very mind puzzling. Spielberg has stated in his interviews that this film was his least favorite of the Indiana Jones films, and the best thing about it is that he met his future ex-wife, Kate Capshaw while making it. Harrison Ford himself was not entirely comfortable with the film's story and, again, according to some sources, he was not entirely happy with how the film turned out either. I have to agree. I didn't like how Indiana Jones turn to a bad guy, Indiana Jones. I was never a huge fan of those hero possessed trope. It's just downright unpleasant. George Lucas was very depress, when making the film, as he was going through a divorce at the time. Composer John Williams was the only one, that didn't seem like he hate, making the film. His score really shine in this film. His reprised theme song for Indiana Jones is just as catchy today, as it was, when it first came out. It's so memorable. Despite the fact, that most of the film is set in caves, or in sets. The movie did make great use of exotic location, when filming in Sri Lanka. Overall: The movie is ridiculous, yet ridiculously entertaining. It's worth watching, even with the camp factor.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

They end up in a small Indian village, where the people believe that evil spirits have taken all their children away after a sacred precious stone was stolen! They also learn about the terror surrounding a booby-trapped temple known as the Temple of Doom! So Indy sets off in his search for ""fortune and glory""I loved this movie as a kid, believing as a rule ""newer is always better"" watching it now on bluray I have very mixed feelings. You could see George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were going for a darker tone ala the second Star Wars movie ""Empire Strikes Back"". But there are amazingly stupid attempts at slap stick comedy (the giant diamond getting lost amongst the spilt ice, Indy's attempts at getting the antidote,one guard throwing a hammer away and knocking another guard out) that are stupidly out of place. I'll get the bad out of the way first. Some absolutely awful editing, (See Indy fighting the guard on the rock crusher the distance between his head and the stone wheel gets larger between shots.) bad green screen and stunt doubles. As for continuity errors this may well be Spielberg's worst movie, there are so many, I lost count, and my 8 year old son picked some of them up on his first viewing. Whilst attractive Kate Kapshaw is very annoying, some of the things she says and does are ridiculous given the situations. And I'm pretty sure the opening singing and dancing number was so Spielberg could showcase his future wife (they met on this movie) Now that's out of the way...Ford is once again excellent as Indiana Jones, he really got himself in great shape for this instalment, probably the next he looked in the entire franchise. Jonathan Ke Quan (Shortie) is excellent considering this is his film debut. It was no surprise to see him turn up in the Spielberg produced ""Goonies"" the following year. What is surprising since then he only has eight more acting credits to his name. Amrish Puri is a very good villain as Mola Ram too. The rope bridge and mine cart chase are two excellent scenes that make my Top 10 Indiana Jones moments. The movie seems confused as to what it wants to be, a darker continuation of the first movie, or a kids adventure movie and it falls somewhere in between.

It is a near non-stop action ride with a higher dosage of adrenaline rush sequences than its predecessor; riveting right from the Busby Berkeley style opening, through to its mine shaft races, through to its memorable rickety bridge climax. Well crafted as the action sequences are, the best aspect of the film is that it is a full-fledged comedy, as opposed to 'Raiders' with its mere intermittent laughs. Dr. Jones is such a larger-than-life character that he feels more at home here. Not all of the comedy works with Jonathan Ke Quan sometimes a little too cute as the kid and Kate Capshaw sometimes shrill as the nightclub singer, however, both co-stars have their fair share of genuinely funny moments with Ke Quan and Ford playing cards, ignoring Capshaw's screams as she encounters various wildlife, a particular highlight. Critics of the film have cited how culturally insensitive certain elements are, but it is hardly as if anyone behind the film is taking the material seriously.

Perhaps there was too much anticipation; as sequels traditionally seldom please.WITH THE PRODUCTION of this picture, perhaps the production team had this in mind and hence overcompensated; if only just a trifle. The truly grossly sacrificial scenes, the extremely gruesome and plentiful cult tribesman and especially the lengthy, over-extended ""rollercoaster"" ride in the temple are all fine and negative example of the old saying that ""Less is More!"" PERSONALLY SPEAKING, WE found that runaway coaster to be dizzying, blurring and even nauseating. It produced a sort of psychosomatic motion/sea sickness in us; which detracted from the rest of the picture and even a DOGFATHER CARTOON that followed.OTHER THAN THE inclusion of Professor Jones and Company's saving the day, the plot seems awfully familiar. This sort of representation of an evil twist on THE PIED PIPER OF HAMLIN plot line had been done before. The independent Producer/Director Frank Ferrin had given us SABAKA (Frank Ferrin Productions/United Artists, 1954) a full 27 years prior. It featured a mystery of disappearing village children, the victims of an evil cult.* PERHAPS THIS IDEA resonated from the deep recesses of someone's mind, quite subconsciously of course, and served for the central theme of this Film's plot. We would never think to imply that there is any case of plagiarism.PEOPLE OF THE high caliber of Mr. Lucas and Mr. Spielberg & Associates are far above such behaviour! NOTE: * This truly ""B"" Movie production of SABAKA (1954) was filmed by the same crew that brought us the GUNGA & RAMA Elephant Boy adventures that were a regular feature on THE SMILIN' ED McCONNEL BUSTER BROWN TV Show.

67,Dr_Coulardeau,Great adventure but questionable morality,8,15 September 2009,"In this film, as compared to the previous one, we progress backward from 1936 to 1935. We move across the universe from Egypt to China and India. The team is reinforced with a nice little but strong Chinese boy. The film is absolutely packed with suspense and action, and yet the film is also packed with all kinds of interesting questions though it does not provide us with all the answers, far from it. At the beginning we have the Chinese mafia of this time but the film forgets to explain that this Chinese mafia is the result of the Opium war or wars, of the control of China by the English and other western countries, and that this mafia will be quite happy with the Japanese some years later. This quite one-sided vision seems to support the idea that in China the mafia controls everything, the police, the bars, drugs and opium, the government, you name it you have it. Then in India that poor Indiana discovers and dismantles a terroristic and fascist small potentate that imposes an extreme vision of Hinduism based on human sacrifice (God knows Spielberg makes us shiver in front of this horror), the legend of five miraculous stones that would give the Indians their power back against the English, the colonizing power, and these believers have to exploit children in mines in the worst possible way and with the most unimaginable violence (God knows Spielberg insists on the inhumanity of this crime against civilization). But this seems to imply that this Hinduism is producing that kind of sectarian and dictatorial vision and action. These people must be barbarians and that is purely racist somewhere (it is true Bush will come later with his war on terror that is implying the same thing about another religion), whereas the enlightened Americans are bringing freedom (God it is so true in Iraq and Afghanistan). These people eat insects, spiders and the fresh brain of monkeys, snakes and all kinds of nice juicy animals of that type. But the worst part is the role and function of the English in all that. Their representative is sharing these beautiful banquets with the local maharajah who is a child. Then they come nearly at the end to save the day that is mostly saved anyway, and they don't even use their guns because they use Indian soldiers to do the shooting. What's more these English-loving Indian soldiers have blue turbans, whereas the barbaric slave owners and exploiters have mainly red uniforms and turbans. These red and blue are not gratuitous. But no answer again and we cannot say that the worst violence and the worst massacres in India were done by turbaned Hindu extremists but rather by the very British colonizers. This film purports for the people who don't know history, which means the majority of the audience, that the evil of this world is not the colonizing western powers but extremist Hindus and Chinese Mafiosi. That is at least an extreme lie and an unacceptable disguise, not for truth that does not exist on such subjects, but for the slightest possible objectivity. Entertaining cannot mean conveying racist and western-centered prejudices.

68,zkonedog,"Not The Best Indy, But Not Nearly Deserving Of Bad Reputation",8,25 February 2017,"Until ""Crystal Skull"" came along, ""Temple of Doom"" carried the mantle of ""worst Indiana Jones movie"". There was even a stigma attached to it as being overly violent and perhaps even a bit obscene. While I will by no means say that ""Temple"" is the best of Indy, it is a very entertaining movie not nearly deserving of its odd reputation.For a basic summary, ""Temple of Doom"" sees a pre-Nazi era Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) stumble into an adventure in India, where he is tasked with retrieving a magic stone for an ancient village. Along the way, Indy is saddled with ""singing sensation"" Willie (Kate Capshaw), as well as helped by pint-sized, precocious child Short-Round (Jonathan Ke Quan).From the very beginning (opening with the odd, yet surprisingly endearing, show tune ""Anything Goes""), one can tell that this film will be a departure from ""Raiders"". Generally speaking, I think that was the right decision, as ""Temple manages"" to be both original and highly entertaining...a difficult task for any ""second movie"" in a franchise. There are a number of things that make this movie memorable, including...-A score that somehow manages to top the original. -A number of thrilling moments that are actually bigger/better than anything ""Raiders"" provided. I especially enjoyed the spike-room trap scene, and the mine cart chase is incredible! -Little doses of humor mixed throughout the film. Sometimes it goes a bit over-the-top, but for a film filled with mysticism and often intense material, it needs to de-compress from time to time.Put simply, ""Temple of Doom"" is a solid film that holds its own in the Indy canon. Sure, it is the ""oddest"" of the franchise (""Cali-Ma"" scene, etc.), but that doesn't equate to ""bad"" in any sense.That being said, there are still two main reasons that ""Temple"" isn't quite as good as the installments that bracket it:1. Trying to push the romance between Indy & Willie. I understand Willie's place in the film (comic relief) and Capshaw plays it perfectly, but having her as a love interest for the serious Dr. Jones is ludicrous. I hate to give ""Crystal Skull"" much credit for anything, but even that effort knew to bring back Marion instead of Willie. 2. I think the Indy formula works slightly better when identifiable historical objects are used. Indy finding the Ark of the Covenant or fighting the Nazis is something much more easily identifiable than, say, finding a magic stone for an Indian village. This really robs ""Temple"" of the ""history professor"" aspect of the Jones character.Bottom line: Despite not being the best of the Indiana Jones franchise, ""Temple of Doom"" is a solid, highly entertaining installment nonetheless, with its shortcomings having little to nothing to do with its perceived ""weirdness"".

As strange as it sounds, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is very much the sort of film in which a ceiling of spikes descending and threatening to impale its hapless characters is qualified to be a pleasant excursion from proceedings.

There is one instance, involving a centuries old cult gathering, featuring much peril and pain which leads one character to reiterate that ""nobody has seen this for (about) a hundred years...."" – we get to see one and a half of what the guy's talking about in about ten minutes, and it still wasn't a pleasure.On the one had, and pleasingly so, Spielberg's film cannot help itself; it is so preoccupied with moving onwards and upwards to a fresh set piece or instance of great surprise or action that it cannot be reprimanded for dwelling too much on its instances of great repulsion. Its narrative is weak, but its general sense of spectacle and show is second to very few; its obsession with doing its utmost to try and take its viewer's breath away, or coercing one into exhaling deeply when it is evident peril has been averted for the time being, somewhat infectious. There is a moment nearer the end when we're led into thinking the way out of a proverbial Hell for the leads lies with a hole in a mineshaft wall beyond yonder, but it is revealed when they get there that the exit is merely the access to a thousand yard drop – and the few hundred tons of water hot on their tails has got to flow into somewhere....The film begins in 1930s China, and rather inexplicably with a dance number following a neat reference to the old Rank studios ident in the form of a gentleman sounding a gong. During the dance number, we cannot get a lock on what it is the primary female performer is singing, such is the language barrier, but we catch the lyric ""anything goes...."" plus her wink to the camera - effectively the film announcing that the rule book is out the window and you're now in LucasFilm's domain. Jones, played by Harrison Ford, in what is to most his seminal career role, is milling around; speaking Mandarin and dealing with some shady looking locals whilst keeping a cool head in amidst the chaos which eventually erupts. In doing business there, he picks up an American lounge singer; a certain Willie Scott (Capshaw), who's famous enough for some random British docks merchant in the area to know whom she is, but is ultimately a gold digging, vanity subscribing annoyance whose presence pales in comparison to Allen's Marion character three years previously. Jones and Willie's initial coming together is wholly representative of how their overall tie will unfold; that is to say, her inherent goofiness playing out along side his suaveness as he does what he does.Fumbling out of China and crash-landing into the wilds of India, Jones; Scott and his miniature Chinese accomplice named Short Round (Ke Quan) happen upon a desolate village, whom charge him with heading out of his way to retrieve a sacred stone stolen from them as well as rescue the village's child population whom were additionally taken. Later on, one of the missing children actually survives the long trek back to the village after an escape, in what is a visual indication of the off screen enemy and the looming brutality of their nature. Accepting the proposal to investigate, the trio arrive at a local palace in amidst the hotbed of the apparent nastiness; a place occupied by Oxford-educated locals doing well to elevate the somewhat damning representation of Indians as these backward, mythicism subscribing kooks, but a happening which further still carries with it grizzly underbellies of unfortunate wrongful representation.The film is essentially a LucasFilm show-reel, a showing off of numerous illusions and gimmicks formulating into a number of set pieces running on wafer-thin plotting; a welcoming, via that more than revealing fourth wall breaking opening wink, into the Spielberg theme-park of tricks; ghost trains and rollercoasters best encapsulated when a roller-coaster point of view composition on the front of one of the carts involved in the later mine chase dominates screen time for a good fifteen seconds. It is nothing like Radiers of the Lost Ark, and yet has inherently similar characteristics with said film; those exchanges then were fun and full of glee, these are just wacky and off the reigns – often disgusting. The women are not as strong, the sense of adventure as characters charged around the globe thwarting evil feels less present and the entire exercise has an unwelcome sense of unbalance about it.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
71,filipemanuelneto,"Mr. Spielberg, what the hell happened here?",3,16 May 2016,"In this film, the second in Indiana Jones franchise, the famous explorer goes to India, where he will face a strange and dangerous cult that kidnaps children in a nearby village of their temple. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this prequel to the first film has script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, and keeps Harrison Ford in the title role.See this movie and compare it with the first of the franchise makes you want to ask Spielberg what the hell went wrong. After a film as interesting as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (which revealed some flaws, but had a very own charm), this one is a real cold shower. Kate Capshaw is a perfect casting error, never managing to overcome the mediocrity. Harrison Ford, although don't embarrassed his character, also doesn't appeared to be properly inspired, making his role without much emotion. For posterity, however, are the scenes of the banquet in the palace, who can start sonorous laughter from any audience. The script is not necessarily interesting, missing movement, the action is very concentrated only in certain sequences. The photograph is bad and boring, colors are too loaded, especially red tones, which is not good, although the visual effects have won an Oscar. The costumes are well imagined and some scenarios as well but the soundtrack brings no surprises or novelties.People say that there is no love like the first, and this is true in the movies: after a movie like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was very hard not to disappoint the audience, but it would have been easier to please with a smarter script, a more vivid and adventurous story, a less forced photograph and a main actress better and less noisy.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
72,leplatypus,The divine comedy (DVD),10,20 February 2011,"This novel from Dante is appropriate with Indy2 because they share the same journey underground to meet hell.I heard critics didn't like it as well as women rights associations. But why? First, so many sequels are just such a repeat of the first than they become remake (Terminator, Ghosbusters, Back to the future,...). Here, you go to desert to jungle, to Judaism to Hindouism. Since i watched it in family at screen nearly 30 years ago, this movie remains a great meeting with this ancestral but unknown civilization.Then, they say that this movie isn't fit to kids because of the violence notably against kids. Well, my opinion is the same as watching wrestling games: the over the top violence is educative to prepare their future adult world of injustice and isn't gratuitous because it infused with a taste of morality as well: Here, as soon as the kids are in danger or pain, Indy or Short Hand don't want to leave them! Also, they said that Scott is a foolish, weak woman, who kept screaming or whining in opposition to the strong, fearless man! Well, it's a comedy not a social study! The healthy concept of laughing is based upon suffering (it's not me who lives this terrible situation) thus every thing funny can blame someone! But I admit that it's the only movie where Indy was truly a loser (after he has drunk the potion) and it was painful to see it like this, going into the dark side (a future Vader?).Nonetheless, Spielberg, Lucas, Ford and Williams give us again a historic, exotic, funny, dynamic, spiritual action / adventure and I thank them as the village chief!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

It plays like the most violent kiddie movie ever made. I watch it now and wonder why it didn't get an R rating (PG-13 came about because of parents' reaction to this movie). ""Temple of Doom"" has a weak story. It's too loud and the jokes aren't that funny. It wastes too much time going for the gross-out. It's biggest sin is that it reduces the dreamy Kate Capshaw to a screaming annoyance. Until she puts on that costume towards the end, I hate every time she's on screen.

76,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Second Indiana Jones installment is like a long, fun thrill ride",8,15 March 2008,"It might just be the mine cart chase sequence at the end, but in reality that scene seems to sum up ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" quite accurately: a theme park ride. When the film was over, I wanted to go to Disneyland to ride the Indiana Jones ride.Harrison Ford stars once again as Hollywood's greatest adventure hero, Indiana Jones, in a film that serves as a prequel to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" In this film, Indy is finishing a job in Shanghai, with the help of his young sidekick Short Round, that goes awry and gets him stuck toting about a singer Willie (Kate Capshaw). On the plane ride out of the East, the three find they've been tricked and crash land in India, where they are sucked into a quest to retrieve an artifact from a hidden temple.The plot is pretty much garbage: all it does is allow for Indiana to fight against a crazy possessed tribe of Indians which means different sets and costumes, but it moves from one suspenseful scene to the next with bits of ridiculous comedy in between and proves to be all together quite fun. You find yourself constantly wondering how Indy will get out of the next death trap, waiting for the next gross insect or dead body to be found, and watching what cool move Indy will pull out of his sleeve next. It's great, quality entertainment. You don't care about the plot after awhile, you just want to see cool action scenes and the stunts in this film are awesome.Kate Capshaw gets a bit annoying in most of her scenes, but at least what happens to her is funny. There is something amusing about an elephant smacking her with his trunk over and over again as she has a normal conversation with Indy. Ford, however, is just as great as ever. Even though Jones spends most of 95% of the time as the adventurer and not the professor in this film, he is so much more human than most action heroes because he's not always getting out of every situation himself and he gets beat up pretty bad. Ford is great at being both humble and cool.""Temple of Doom"" ends up being a non-stop thrill ride, which is all it needs to be. All the things that made ""Raiders"" a great film get priority in this film, so it spends less time caring about the bizarre plot and more time testing the physical limits of Harrison Ford's body. While it may not be the strongest in the collection, it certainly holds its own and is not an Indiana Jones film to be passed on.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

79,jzappa,"The Breathless Modern Gunga Din, with the River Kwai's Sky Filled with Flocking Bats",10,28 October 2011,"This chef d'oeuvre is one of the most unremittingly nonstop action films ever made, with an expert succession of climactic sequences. It's a roller-coaster ride---at one point very literally---a visual extravaganza, a technical coup and masses of exuberant pleasure. And yet it was made when ambitious filmmakers and imaginative audiences still had that odd idea that one of the points of editing is to clarify why one shot follows another, or why various shots happen in the arrangement that they do. Because Spielberg and Lucas' adventures templates were shaped from magic into commodity from then to now, today's moviegoers are instead blunted by duration-centered sequences comprising slapdash, heedless jumbles of graceless shots. We see one special effect then another, and we're supposed to be appreciative that we've been shown two special effects, despite that there is nothing and no one on screen to care about except the magnitude of the spectacle.Spielberg and Lucas didn't equate building on Raiders by simply making everything bigger and louder. The energy of storytelling imagination is put forth double-time. It works in its own way, and makes use of from different conventions from different eras. Right off the bat, Indy is in a Shanghai nightclub stand-off with gangsters. He escapes in the nick of time, taking along a blonde nightclub gang moll and convoyed by his loyal young helper, Short Round. Their escape leads them into a string of adventures: A flight over the Himalayas, a stunning flee from a crashing plane and a chance encounter with a village leader who implores Indy to find and retrieve the village's beloved stone which vanished with all of the village's children. Indy and Willie barely get to turn in for the night before the movie's second half starts with a mind-blowing chain of escapades involving the hellish mines underneath the palace.Befittingly to the purely fairy-tale tone of this epic adventure, Spielberg and Lucas stuck to a make-believe India, not the real one. The Thuggee cult is maybe at least as predisposed to Africa as India, what with the Maharajah's voodoo doll, the shrunken head on Mola Ram's headdress, and the ""black sleep of Kali,"" caused by drinking blood and cured by burning one's flesh. Power of invention? Certainly. Just like that outrageous runaway mine chase. Short Round's no 1D token either. The kid cheats at cards, but it takes nothing less than Indy under Mola Ram's Superman 3-style spell to bring tears to his eyes.Moments like the collapsing bridge, the mine cart ride, and the cave full of bugs are as awe-inspiring or more so than anything in the first film. The set design, art direction, special effects and sound effects that create this subterranean hell are among the most striking realizations in the entire lineage of summer blockbusters. As dozens of small children toil on chain gangs, the vile maharajah keeps them in thrall by employing the menacing command of the mislaid gemstone and its two counterparts. Indy and company behold in wonder, and then Indy endeavors to steal it back. Some of the film's most indelible set pieces now occur: Human sacrifices are lowered into a yawning volcano in a cage, creepy ceremonies are honored and there's a chase in the mine's cavernous railway. As Indy and company race in the small unmanageable mine car, the thugs are behind, ahead, above, below and alongside them, and the scene will throttle you and leave you almost physically winded. And it's perhaps more than any other action sequence liable for the ever-present simile of summer movies as roller-coaster rides.Temple of Doom is not only as hypnotizing as I recalled, but it stands up to my cynical cinephile eyes every single smidgen as well as it did to the bulging eyes of my childhood. Temple of Doom make no excuses for being precisely what it is: Invigorating, frenzied, violently creative escapism. No regrets are needed. This is the most willfully electrifying, wacky, passionate adventure movie since even before Raiders, and a very small handful after. It's quite an event. It leaves you reeling with a juvenile smile.This is the uncommon genre film that accomplishes a voodoo of populist and formalistic fascination, warranting the true label of ""classic"" by selling unadulterated pop delight so self-possessed that our more mature filmic sensibilities embrace it. To snub these films is a subject of taste, but to criticize them would be coarse and misunderstanding of their beeline approach. Whether or not it's on par with Swan Lake or a Rembrandt portrait is possibly disputable, but I don't want to meet the person that doesn't admit it's a superlative, enrapturing entertainment. The movie also gives us the one Indiana Jones baddie in the entire series to outsmart him, Lao Che. And he's excellent. The opening scene at Club Obi Wan is nothing short of immortal, both for opening the movie with a totally unreal Busby Berkeley homage in Chinese, and zeroes in on a shimmering blue antidote and a diamond, but mainly the blue antidote.Let's also not overlook John Williams firing on all deep-rooted, ineradicable cylinders with the score, unquestionably one of his best. The Short Round and Temple of Doom themes are up there with those of Darth Vader and Jurassic Park. Together with the spike chamber, elephants, old village sage, ""vampire"" bats, the silencer proxied by popping champagne corks, the literal cliffhanger on the rope bridge, Indy's Superman III momentsit's deliriously magnificent. In this movie, really, ""Anything Goes.""",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
80,Vartiainen,We introduce a darker edge to Indiana Jones,10,6 July 2017,"In this prequel of a sort we get to follow Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) on one of his adventures before the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was clear from that movie that Dr. Jones had been tomb raiding his way across the globe for a while now and this just happens to be one of those adventures. Brilliant, sign me on!The film certainly doesn't disappoint. It's a bit more centralized than the previous film or The Last Crusade, mainly taking place in the jungles of India, but it still delivers the same sense of adventure, excitement and history intertwined with myth. The story going that Indiana Jones stumbles upon an Indian village that has had it religious relic stolen by the soldiers of a nearby palace supposedly ruled by a cult of evil.Many people call this the weakest of the original Indiana Jones trilogy, and I can see why. It's more centralized, the myth that inspires the events is not as iconic or well-known, we don't see many of our favourite side characters from the previous film and it's a lot darker in tone, which bothers some people. Plus the new side characters are annoying. I can personally deal with Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan), but Willie (Kate Capshaw) is a total pain. Especially when you compare her to Marion (Karen Allen) from the previous film. Now there was a woman! Tough as nail adventurer, who could drink you under the table just as easily as she could seduce you. Whereas Willie just kind of... screams a lot.And yet... I like this film a lot. The sense of adventure is there, I like the darker tone and the sets are some of the best in the franchise, as are the action scenes. I think the mining cart chase might be my favourite action scene ever made. Furthermore, this is an Indiana Jones film and Harrison Ford is just as good as he has always been. Weakest film in the trilogy? Perhaps. That doesn't stop it from being an amazing adventure film in its own right. Give it a rewatch sometimes and judge for yourself.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

He meets Willie(Kate Capshaw), who is a very prissy, and whiny little woman. Then there's Indie's side-kick Short Round(Jonathan Ke Quan) who is very dependent and confident in his friend. They go through danger like a hot knife through butter. The action was all there in the movie, also there was some comedy in-between. The dinner scene was a hoot. The food they had was a major freak out for Willie, she told the guy she had bugs already, for lunch. The cult scene was disturbing. The leader rips out the heart of a victim, very blood-curdling.

83,FiendishDramaturgy,"Amazing, fun, darker second adventure",9,1 January 2004,"After seeing the original Indiana Jones movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, I did not think it was possible to do any better than that, but this ""sequel"" is every bit as good as the original work.With the addition of ""Short Round,"" a small boy new to the company of Indiana Jones, the producers have given children a new connection with this franchise. It turned out to be a brilliant move, and a wonderful addition which, unfortunately, they did not carry through to the third installment.What struck me most with this work was the depth of research done concerning the Sankara Stones. According to legend, there were five of these stones, taken from what is now referred to as the Sankara Complex, in India. The legend has it just as it is represented in the movie. In the presence of three or more of the stones, you were given an increasingly higher level of power by the Deities. To possess all five, you would be invincible.The Thugee Murder Cult was, and is, real. They have been documented and even associated with the Zodiac killings of the 60-70's, and mentioned, however briefly, in the disappearance of Jon Benet Ramsey.These followers of the dark Goddess of Death, Kali, of the Hindu Pantheon of deities, were known for living dual lives, especially when in other countries where secrecy was an issue. They believe that by sending souls to Kali, their lives here will be uplifted by this dark Goddess, and therefore, they have been known to commit multiple murders, including the annihilation of entire villages throughout India. These practitioners of the Black Kabballah are very real, and were depicted quite well in this production. I was very impressed with the degree of research involved here.This is action from the beginning; adventure through and through. A grand total of ONE slow spot was found here, and that was used to further the character development of Short Round, and show the depth of his relationship with Dr. Jones. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The costumes were wonderfully designed, and were quite authentic in the area of Indian style and dress. I pay attention to set designs and costuming. They can make or break a movie, for me. Rich architectural designs can add so much to a movie, just as unrealistic, plastic-looking ""rock"" surfaces in the background, can kill the whole mood of the scene. But you have none of those problems with these productions. It appears as though no expense was spared; no scene overlooked. This is a true quality production.Furthermore, the performances were completely believable, even those of the Indian children who were originally cast as extras. Their performances were absolutely wonderful, the story was quite enthralling, and the time just sped by. The only problem I had with this movie is that it was over far too quickly. This attempt was professional in all ways, and is, in my opinion, the very best of this series.This is my favorite of the Indiana Jones run for its dark realism.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
84,ackstasis,"""You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory""",8,16 July 2008,"'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)' has always been the black sheep of the Indiana Jones family. Indeed, it is noticeably darker in tone and humour than the two Nazi-themed adventures on either side, and the premise of the Shankara Stones is admittedly far less glorious than the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail. Nevertheless, the film is to be enjoyed purely for its success as a blockbuster popcorn picture, and few movies can match 'The Temple of Doom' for its adrenaline-charged action and unashamedly-campy sense of fun. Following the phenomenal success of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981),' director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas collaborated once more to bring the second chapter of Harrison Ford's rugged, whip-cracking archaeologist's globe-trotting adventures. Set in 1935, the film is actually a prequel to the original, and takes place almost exclusively in the dark, unchartered depths of India, where primitive holy rituals are still worryingly prevalent, despite the current British occupation.Unlike its two successors, which resurrected popular characters from the first film, 'The Temple of Doom' features only Harrison Ford reprising his role. Young Asian-American Ke Huy Quan is introduced as Indy's pint-sized but very useful sidekick, Short Round, an orphan picked up on the streets of Shanghai. Kate Capshaw, as the prequel's answer to Karen Allen, is severely lacking, though she's quite tolerable in the moments when she's not screaming her lungs out; director Steven Spielberg, who would later marry Capshaw, was evidently blissfully unaware of how annoying her voice could become after even a brief period of time. Nevertheless, Indy's love-hate relationship with Willie Scott provides some key moments of humour, particularly when the pair are in their respective rooms trying simultaneously to justify both their love and hate towards one another. The film's primary villain is an bald, intimidating thug named Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), a sadistic Thuggee high priest with a sinister grin. By collecting the five lost Shankara Stones and offering human sacrifices, he hopes to honour the great deity, Kali.Detractors of the series' most recent instalment, 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008),' have gone to great lengths to decry the sheer absurdity of some of the action sequences. These critics have apparently overlooked the fact that 'The Temple of Doom' contains its own share of ridiculous moments, but, as it is all presented to us with such campish enthusiasm, we are quite willing to accept the story's occasional outlandish quirks. Inflatable rafts falling from light aircraft, warm monkey brains for dessert, bizarre sacrificial rituals involving the removal of a man's heart - it all adds to the pulp feel of the 1930s adventure serials on which Indiana Jones is based. The visuals effects - designed by Dennis Muren, Michael J. McAlister, Lorne Peterson and George Gibbs - still hold up exceedingly well after more than twenty years, and secured the film's only Oscar, from just two nominations. The initial critical response was mixed, and remains so today, but many have come to appreciate Spielberg's film for being such a rollicking good time.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
85,Coxer99,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,9,24 August 1999,"Indiana Jones' second adventure re-creates many of the same thrills as the original and it still works beautifully, but something seems to be lacking.

86,drqshadow-reviews,"Indy's Formula Still Works, Although the Temple Waters it Down",6,19 June 2013,"A divisive chapter among fans of the series, Temple of Doom is easily the silliest of the initial Indiana Jones trilogy. While I've heard the argument that this character thrives on fantastical situations and traces of lore, for my money the envelope is pressed just a bit too far in this instance. Sure, Raiders used the power of the ark to melt the Nazis' skin and Crusade showcased an immortal knight with a collection of stand-in grails, but in each case those represented the climax of a long, grounded adventure - a mere taste of supernatural payoff. Temple shows no such restraint, diving straight in with voodoo dolls, mysterious brainwashing liquids and, memorably, bare-handed heart removals. It also tinkers with the formula of Jones as a loner, with mixed success. Indy's de-facto sidekick, Short Round, plays up every stereotype of a kid tagalong. He's shoehorned in, no doubt about it, but also adds a new dimension to the larger-than-life lead character via their rapid-fire rapport. The additional presence of a blonde love interest, Willie, seems redundant and unnecessary - her constant shrieks and clueless nature gives the impression Indy's babysitting two kids. Of course, it's not all bad news: Harrison Ford works wonders with his shadier lines and knocks the good ones right out of the park, the comic relief scenes (though over-applied) work surprisingly well, and the action / adventure elements the series is best known for hit all the right buttons. There's no shortage of that old, familiar formula here, but I wonder if Spielberg and Lucas may have overreached in an effort to make the film more palatable to the Saturday morning cartoon crowd.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
87,alindsay-al,a huge stepdown from raiders,5,20 September 2014,"After raiders of the lost ark was a superb film this was a very anticipated film for me bit boy does it disappoint. This is a prequel to raiders and it sees indiana Jones and his gang attempt to retrieve a stone for a local tribe while battling evil forces. Now as always Harrison ford returns as Indiana Jones and he is still fantastic with his macho charismatic style that makes this character legendary and one of the best of all time. Unfortunately Harrison ford takes all the acting talent in this film and leaves none for the side characters. Singer willey Scott comes in as his love interest and all she does is scream and shriek and she is just plainly irritating making me wish Marion had returned. A controversial one is the kid short round who most young kids and girls like but I cannot stand him and he is just an irritating side character and I wish either salah or Marcus Brody had been in this film. The villains are also ridiculously over the top and really don't provide any entertainment at all and they don't have any interest at all. The story is okay looking into the supernatural effect and the simplicity of like a treasure hunt. However, I wish they had something involving the Nazis instead of the weird villains in this film. The script is okay with ford doing a great job with his dialogue but nobody elses dialogue is interesting at all and it is just boring like the other characters in this film. The style of Indiana Jones is legendary with the hat, whip and music being awesome. But the setting of the film and the villains really brings it down in my opinion. This is an average film that really disappoints me.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
88,MaxBorg89,"Quite dark, that's true, but also an irresistible ride",9,26 May 2008,"Though there is debate over whether Star Wars was directly planned as a trilogy (or two, as it turned out), the fact that Harrison Ford signed to play Indiana Jones in three films before the first had even been completed indicates George Lucas and Steven Spielberg wanted to do more with the character even if Raiders of the Lost Ark hadn't been the most successful film of 1981 (although that helps a lot as well). For the second installment, Lucas decided to try the same trick he'd used on The Empire Strikes Back: make it darker and more mature than the first film, and you might get better reviews and make more money. He was proved wrong in both cases (The Temple of Doom was ""only"" the third most seen picture of 1984, and Roger Ebert aside critics weren't that enthusiastic, especially regarding the violence), but like the underrated The Godfather: Part III the second Indiana Jones movie is well overdue a re-evaluation: while not exactly a masterpiece like Raiders, for one small reason, it gets very close, and never ceases to entertain.As a matter of fact, one might argue the opening of Doom is even better than the prologue of Raiders, on account of the sequence depicting Indy at his best: always in trouble, often near death, but never willing to surrender - even with poison flowing in his veins. The extravagant beginning is set in Hong Kong, at a club called Obi-Wan (in-jokes - can't get enough of them). Indiana is there to acquire a diamond, but ends up getting poisoned instead, having no other choice but to run for his life (after stealing the antidote, of course) and get the hell out of there with the help of his kid sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan). Unfortunately, he also brings the obnoxious night club singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) with him, and she has a tendency to moan a lot. For a number of reasons, the three wind up in India, where the inhabitants of a village ask them to retrieve a mysterious stone. Given his experience with the Ark of the Covenant, Indy should know better; instead, he accepts to find the stone, risking his life as he comes face to face with one of the most macabre cults ever invented by man.The cult in question, and various scenes featuring its most gruesome traditions, originally upset critics and parents alike, who found the storyline too dark for the genre and unsuitable for children (the film was, and still is, rated PG). Alongside Gremlins, Temple of Doom prompted endless discussions that eventually gave birth to the PG-13 rating, which has been given to every Indiana Jones-like action film ever since (apart from the Disney-produced National Treasure). A lot of fans protested too, finding the material excessively violent. But look past the occasional strong scene and you'll find a near perfect popcorn movie that is constantly fun and exciting, from the spectacular start to the breathtaking climax. There isn't a dull moment in the whole film, even in the more ""relaxed"" bits, courtesy of great chemistry between an always likable Ford and the wonderful Quan. Capshaw is a bit of a problem: she isn't a bad actress (the countless screaming scenes not considered), but she simply doesn't have the appropriate charisma that made Karen Allen an ""Indy girl"" to die for. To paraphrase Short Round: ""No time for love, Dr. Jones!"". However, lambasting her because of her relationship with the director is unfair and also unjustified: there was no favoritism involved in her casting - she didn't start dating, and eventually marry, Spielberg until after filming was over.In the end, all I can say is if you like Indiana Jones, you will find a way to enjoy Temple of Doom. If it doesn't convince you after the first viewing, give it another try. I did, and as always I was eventually won over by the man in the hat and his marvelous adventures: he just happens to have that power.9,5/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
89,Fluke_Skywalker,Tone nearly dooms Temple,6,4 August 2016,"Plot; Archaeologist Indiana Jones, his spunky young sidekick and a spoiled singer travel across--and beneath--India in search of a magical stone that can save a dying village.I think it's fair to say that this is the most contentious entry in the Indiana Jones saga. The general consensus (I believe) is that Raiders and Crusade are viewed as classics and Crystal Skull... isn't. But even though Temple of Doom sports a 7.6 IMDb rating and a %85 score on Rotten Tomatoes, I don't think anyone would disagree that it doesn't share that near universal love that ROTLA and TLC do. Passions run deep on both sides, though, as TOD has more than its share of hardcore fans and champions. Personally I'd always found TOD a flawed film, but not fatally so. For sure Willie Scott is no Marion Ravenwood, though I think the problem lies more with the character's conception, not its execution. The lovely Kate Capshaw gives a good performance of a character I just don't like. I see the logic in making her the anti-Marion, but it just doesn't work here. The film also lacks the globe-trotting scope and scale of its bookends, feeling claustrophobic as it spends a good 2/3 of its runtime indoors; particularly in tight, dark confines. The tone is also off for me. Many often describe it as ""dark"", but I don't see it, unless they mean the cinematography. The actual tone too often borders on camp, with ""humor"" that is too broad and on the nose.There's still an awful lot to like here, though. I realize now that I've come full circle on the character of Short Round, finding him a fun an engaging Robin to Indy's Batman. I don't think he'd have worked in Raiders or Crusade, but he works just fine here, and Jonathan Ke Quan deserves all the credit. There are also a number of fun action scenes, from the opening scrum for the poison antidote to the white-knuckle mine car chase.So, a lot works, but a lot also doesn't. It leaves Temple of Doom an uneven viewing experience for me, and a film that is difficult to reconcile my feelings for. Still, I suppose my initial feeling that it was ""flawed, but not fatally so"" still stands, though on slightly more wobbly legs.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
90,snoozejonc,Enjoyable Indy adventure with some pretty dark moments,9,27 August 2020,"Dr Jones finds himself in India on a quest to save village children and recover a collection of sacred stones.I enjoyed this for the escapism and the spectacular thrill ride it takes the audience on.The plot is a simple McGuffin story, quite dark and violent, with human sacrifice, child abuse and slavery thrown into the mix.Indy has never been more Bond-like in his entrance to this film and he maintains the persona throughout the entirety of what is a superbly choreographed opening action sequence. Accompanying Indy on this adventure are Shanghai nightclub singer Willy Scott and street urchin Short Round. The dynamic works well as the three have pretty good chemistry throughout. Kate Capshaw is hilarious as a total diva being put through hell during the adventure. Jonathan Ke Quan plays a bit of a Far-Eastern stereotype but he gives a very likeable performance.The action sequences are as spectacular as ever with most holding up to modern age scrutinisation. One sequence on board a speeding minecart is literally a rollercoaster ride for the audience. Also, Indy's solution to the problem of being surrounded on a rope bridge is a classic franchise moment.As you would expect the sets are very impressive, particularly the scenes in the underground Thuggie temple.John Williams' score is as wonderful as everything else he does in Hollywood movies. In addition the soundtrack also includes Kate Capshaw singing Cole Porter's ""Anything Goes"" in Mandarin during a memorable opening musical number.The strength of 'Temple of Doom' lies in how different in tone it is from both 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'The Last Crusade'. It is darker, more violent and the adventure has a more random and spontaneous feel of Indy accidentally getting caught up something as opposed to setting off out of choice. There are no Nazis or loved-up archeology students. We have an old fashioned damsel in distress, scream queen of a leading lady.Unfortunately we have some racial caricatures that would not see the light of day in the modern era and one major gross-out scene involving the consumption of live snakes, dead beetles and chilled monkey brains that was a bit too memorable for some. The notion of Hindu characters eating this type of meal is a joke that misfired for Spielberg and Lucas. In fact there are no positive Indian character portrayals in a film with a strong 'white saviour' theme running through it.I watched this many times as a child and my daughter has done the same from quite a young age. It may be too nasty for children not used to seeing the images like the ones mentioned already along with someone ripping the hearts out of sacrifice victims and drinking blood. In the version I showed my daughter, the heat scene is edited out so as not to be so graphic, however the uncut version it pretty gruesome.Overall a highly enjoyable addition to the franchise but might be a bit too different for those who prefer Indy fighting Nazis and digging up biblical relics. It probably only deserves a 7.5 due to the racial/cultural problems, but 80s nostalgia and the fact that it held my daughter for the duration pushes it to an 8.5. As always I round my score upwards.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
91,r96sk,"Good, fairly entertaining",7,16 April 2020,"'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' is on the same footing as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', as it serves as a prequel to the aforementioned 1981 production.Like the first film, Temple of Doom doesn't set the world alight but remains a good, fairly entertaining experience. Harrison Ford is again far and away the star, everything impressive comes from him. Jonathan Ke Quan makes for a fun sidekick.This one does have some cool scenes, mainly nearer the end involving the minecarts. John Williams' overall score is nicely done for the second time, though we don't need to hear the main part of the theme song quite so much.Again, there's still something that I can't quite put my finger on that's missing - it's without that extra thing to take it up a level in my estimations. I am fully aware I'm in the minority in this regard.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
92,barnabyrudge,"An entertaining experience, but unable to match the sheer brilliance of the original.",6,9 September 2004,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the second of the Indy films from director Steven Spielberg, though chronologically it is actually the first. This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark tries to out-do its predecessor for breakneck spills and gross-out moments, but the sparkle isn't quite there. It's an entertaining film for sure, but not as good as the original, partially because the plotting this time round is a little awkward and partially because Kate Capshaw as the main female character is an almighty irritation.The film opens in a Shanghai restaurant, where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) causes a riot in pursuit of a diamond. Fleeing the scene with American singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and teenaged pick-pocket Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), he escapes to the airport. However, Indy and his companions unwittingly board an airplane owned by one of Indy's enemies, from which they have to make an audacious mid-air escape when the real pilots bail out mid-flight! Soon, the intrepid trio find themselves in India, where they come across a village in the grip of starvation. The village children have been kidnapped by local cultists to work in a mine, digging for the sacred Sankara Stones, and Indy is persuaded by the distraught villagers to rescue their youngsters. His quest takes him to the opulent Pankot Palace and, beneath it and beyond a maze of tunnels, the Temple of Doom.Ford is great as Jones, bringing genuine charisma to a role that he was born to play (can you imagine how things would have turned out if Tom Selleck had got the part, as originally planned?) There are some great moments along the way too, including the intentionally subversive opening sequence in Shanghai, a particularly funny and exciting runaway mine-train sequence, and an unforgettable banquet at Pankot Palace in which the food served up is enough to churn any stomach. But Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom still can't live up to the standard set by Raiders of the Lost Ark. As mentioned, Capshaw is a real pain on the senses as the always-squealing heroine, and the plot seems to over-stretch in an effort to link to the next development or set piece. The hunt-for-the-missing-children plot device allows Spielberg to dip into the kind of cloying sentimentality that occasionally mars his films too. This is certainly an entertaining and professionally assembled film, but in no way a rival or an equal to the excellence of its predecessor.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Indy and the two others escaped in time before they get killed in the plane. They also find themselves in India, they are in a remote village... where the villagers children are kidnapped to be slaves at a fortress-like mine. But they find themselves more than they bargain for... when they meet a ruthless cult leader (Roshan Seth) and his men.

The Extra Terresial, 1941, Sugarland Express) made an truly entertaining prequel to the ever-popular ""Raiders of the Lost Art"". The prequel is actually my favorite of the four movies. It may be darker and more violent but i think, it is also the most fun. Quan is certainly an standout as Short Round. There's some truly memorable moments, especially the ultimate roller-coaster sequence and the tasteless gross-out supper scene.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Which this DVD is digitally remastered for THX in Superior Sound and Picture Quality. This DVD has no special features expect for the re-issue DVD... just recently. The Box Set from the Bonus DVD does have an documentary about the prequel, four featurettes and trailers. ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" was an big box office success expect that certain film audiences and film critics truly hated it. Also it causes problems with the rating boards (Same goes for ""Joe Dante's Gremlins"", also Spielberg was one of the executive producers).There's an infamous sequence, when the villain rips-off the beating heart of a powerless victim with the power of black magic but with no blood. There's an familiar scene done two years earlier with the Camp Classic B Movie ""Evilspeak"" but that movie has done with blood and gore. Although ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is rated PG, it causes later movies to have an rating between PG and R. Which the new rating at the time between PG and R is PG-13. Which PG-13 is a life saver for plenty of different films for the movie studios. ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is certainly one of the most memorable big budget Hollywood movies of the 1980""s and it still looks great today.

Many of the events happen out of nowhere and random, like for example when Indiana searches the room from assassins, he finds nobody, but when he suspects there is a hidden door just because of breeze, even though the exit door was open and the breeze could have come from there... Anyway the whole fact that the hidden door is in the guest room makes no sense, because any of the guests could have accidently found it sooner or later. This film is full of terrible storytelling choices.
It is quite an adventurous and fun film, but way too random.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

This movie tries to make Indy more kid friendly while adding some graphic gore at the same time. Somehow, it doesn't seem to throw the tone off much. But it does has one major flaw: Kate Capshaw.

96,Samuel-Shovel,The Worst of the Original Trilogy... But Still Not Bad,7,15 November 2017,"While ""The Temple of Doom"" may not be quite as good as its predecessor or successor, as far as big budget summer blockbusters go, this one's a lot of fun!After escaping from China and crash-landing in India, Indiana Jones and a few tag-alongs must retrieve a sacred stone from an ancient temple and return it to a small village in order to right the forces of good and evil. Easier said than done.I'll start with the good stuff: this movie is nonstop action! Everything in this movie is full of tension and suspense. From the first 15 minutes onward, this movie really picks up steam and continues to roll down the tracks with no brakes until we hit the credits. In that respect, it's everything you want in an adventure movie.I also have to credit the set design. These settings are lush and detailed and absolutely breath-taking. Spielberg knows how to do 'big' movies like this and he doesn't disappoint from the optical perspective. I'll add that the score is timeless and puts a smile on my face every time I hear it.But I also understand why some are not huge fans of this movie. The obvious issues with this movie are related to the supporting cast. In ""Raiders"" we got great performances out of Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies. In ""Temple"" we get... Kate Capshaw. She is absolutely unbearable in this movie as the screaming, helpless, ditsy blonde. I'm sure Miss Capshaw is a fine person and a fine actress but this character is the worst! 90% of her lines involve her screaming in fright or anger. She has no redeeming qualities, even up to the bitter end.Only slightly more bearable is Short Round played by Jonathan Ke Quan. His character may have been charming and funny back in the day but I just don't care for him really at all in this. He's annoying and took me out of a few scenes in this one.This movie also somehow manages to be both campy and darker than the first one. It seems as if Spielberg and Lucas had differing ideas on which direction to take the franchise because it almost looks like they tried to do both. There's more slapstick and silly humor in this one but there's also more torture and violence. These combine to make a real weird atmosphere from scene to scene. The finished product has a sense of duality to it.Despite this movie's shortcomings, it's still a really fun ride and the 2 hours fly by as you sit there eyes wide with a smile on your face watching Indie globetrot around the world.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

""Temple of Doom"" goes way over the top and is too heavy handed on the occult. Lucas has also packed the story with more action this time, which whilst being very entertaining, allows the plot to suffer.The cast do well again, with Harrison Ford supported by wicked Amrish Puri and Roshan Seth, prissy heroine Kate Capshaw (as Willie Scott) and newcomer Ke Huy Quan as side kick Short Round. The movie is technically good once more, with John Williams providing another effective score. Sadly though this second instalment couldn't fill its predecessor's giant shoes, and remains an inferior, far fetched romp whose roller coaster plot and action keeps its audience well entertained, though perhaps disbelieving.Thursday, December 30, 1993 - Astor Theatre",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
98,aharmas,A Great Sequel,9,28 June 2014,"When this film opened, it caused some controversy, and the PG-13 rating was created for films that were not quite suitable for the younger crowd. It was an interesting decision, and most of the times it works. ""Doom"" has a couple of very intense images, one of which involves a human sacrifice, but for the most part, it's not problematic.Indiana goes back chronologically, and during one of his escapades in India, he feels he must go and liberate some children who have been slaved in one of the palaces. There are legends, tales, and rumors, but it doesn't hit the audience or Indy, until one of the kids makes an appearance, and Indiana immediately reacts to the mistreatment of the people in the village. Some people might raise a few concerns about the humor in the first third of the film, and to be truthful, it's not meant to offend. It's a take off of the adventures films of the 30's, and some of the slapstick is pretty funny. The jungle scene, the bug chamber scene, and the dinner scene are classic examples of Spielberg's adept hand at comedy. Oh, yes there is the yuck factor, but how else can you make the adventure entertaining. I'd prefer this to some of the rancid and overdone use of vulgarity one finds in contemporary films.""Raiders"" made everything in the serials fresh again, and the heart- stopping adventures of Indiana surely couldn't be topped. Remember the boulder, the car chases, the snakes? Well, here we have the bugs, the plane ride, the roller coaster ride, the fights, and they're quite fun to watch. In fact, some of them might be even more exciting than the original's.""Doom"" should get credit for being able to keep things sort of fresh, for taking us to another setting, on another wild and fantastic ride, and for adding another chapter to the wonderful world of Indiana Jones. We read about adventures and cliffhangers in exotic locations before the graphic novels became the home of psychologically impaired characters. The turmoil was outside the soul. Nothing again that dark knight, but sometimes we just want to be transported to a place we don't see all the time and feel like a little kid whose world is still open to wonder and the new.It's been a long time, and we might not see this character again; however there is a good chance there might be another Peter Jackson, another Spielberg, another J.J.

Every film series needs its dark chapter, which proved to be the dark and unusual Temple of Doom. Harrison Ford was especially good in his role as Jones, being a little more subdued and action oriented compared to the original. While this film is considered the weakest in the series, I'm not one to go against this assumption.

There's also a lot of supernatural stuff that happens directly to and around Indy here, so his line in Raiders about not believing in that stuff doesn't really track.Still, despite the flaws, the sexism, the racism... 80s Indiana Jones is a lot of fun.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
101,Steffi_P,"""Anything goes""",8,6 March 2011,"It's practically accepted as a given nowadays that the sequel to a major blockbuster will be a pale and paltry reflection of the original. After all, this is what happened with Jaws, Rocky, Jurassic Park and many others. But there are just as many sequel success stories out there, in those cases where the filmmakers got the right balance between repeating the successful formula and adding enough new elements to keep the franchise fresh. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom reprises the modern-day swashbuckler hero, the blend of breakneck action and easygoing humour and the nods towards classic Hollywood movies that made Raiders of the Lost Arc the fine work it is. And yet it takes the adventure to a colourful new location, adds some sinister horror elements and makes the comedy that little bit wackier.And of course director Steven Spielberg again displays himself to be a master at this kind of thing. The action sequences are constructed with rapid editing, and getting this right is not as simple as it looks. The director has to make sure each shot can convey what is going on for its brief duration. He must also keep the impression of frantic movement continuous from one shot to another. Hence, when Indy is battling the chunky guard on the conveyor belt, whenever we cut to the Maharajah and his voodoo doll we get the turning waterwheel in the background, just to keep some moving element in an otherwise placid shot. Often, for example during the mêlée at the club in Shanghai, Spielberg uses camera moves that counteract each other, such as moving the camera up in one shot, moving it down in the next, which gives the sequence a punchy feel. But Spielberg is also working hard on atmosphere in the non-action scenes, for example keeping the camera back amid the foliage during the jungle trek, which gives the unnerving impression that our heroes are being watched.If anything, Harrison Ford seems even better in his role as Indy this time around. He just has this smooth and sophisticated manner that makes us trust him. He can pull off the taunting smile at Kate Capshaw when she eats the unappetizing village food without coming across as mean, and can also compromise his dignity for comic effect whenever some enemy catches his character off guard, as when a thug climbs back on board the mine cart. As his sidekick, Jonathan Ke Quan is a great addition, providing some of the best humour with his lovable smart-aleck ways and keenness to get stuck into adventure. There's also a very fine small performance from Indian actor Roshan Seth, who is brilliant at appearing a model of propriety, yet with that hint of something sinister that makes it believable he could turn out to be a secret baddie. Oh and it's great to see Pat Roach in another appearance as a burly ruffian, bringing the appropriate level of menace to the part as well as his physical bulk.But Temple of Doom is not without its flaws. Kate Capshaw's Willie Scott is not a patch on Karen Allen in the first movie. The character is a stereotype, but one that is irritating rather than funny. And while Amrish Puri is certainly very good at looking evil, his character is two-dimensional compared to the complex Belloq of Raiders. Also, many of its comedy sequences are simply off the mark, especially the disgusting foods business at the palace. Yes, this picture falls some way short of its illustrious predecessor, but since that was a near masterpiece, it could hardly be expected to. There is much to love about Temple of Doom – the disturbing appearance of Thuggee idols in the jungle, the illogical but fun roller-coaster ride, not to mention the tribute to 1930s musical dance sequences that kicks the whole thing off – a bit of a non-sequitur for an action movie but brilliantly done all the same. It all makes this a worthy follow-up that manages to rise above the usual trashy repetitiveness with which the movie sequel is associated.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
102,ShootingShark,Crackerjack Prequel To Raiders Of The Lost Ark,7,18 June 2005,"Following a hair-raising encounter with a Chinese gangster, adventurer Indiana Jones, accompanied by a reluctant nightclub singer and a diminutive assistant, is tasked to recover a sacred stone stolen from a remote village by an evil Indian religious cult.The sequel (though it's set a year earlier) to Raiders Of The Lost Ark, like most sequels, is not nearly as good as the original, but is still an extremely enjoyable escapist action movie. What lets it down a little I think is the script, which is quite ponderous in places when it should be zinging, and never really livens the characters up too much. There are some wonderful sequences however - the opening dance-number and free-for-all in the Shanghai nightclub is terrific, there's a great jump-out-of-a-plane gag, a fabulous gross-out meal of snakes, bugs and monkeys, and the last half-hour, involving a mine-cart chase, a flood and a rope-bridge sequence gives the movie a crash-bang-wallop ending. John Williams' music, George Gibbs' brilliant mechanical effects and particularly Elliot Scott's eye-popping sets (the Thugee's secret chamber and underground mine is an astounding piece of production design) all contribute to a great looking film. The cast all give it their best amid the frenetic fury but the characters are often too one-dimensional - Indy is a bit dour and noble, Willie (Capshaw) is funny but one-note, and none of the villains are given anything interesting to say (an unforgivable crime). Minor gripes aside though, this is still fantastic entertainment by anyone's standards, and the Sri Lanka locations add to the visual splendour. Ripping stuff.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
103,adamjohns-42575,Indy rides again!,8,19 January 2021,"In my opinion this is the worst of the four films. It just doesn't have that flowing journey that the others do, focussed as it is in one place and with Short-Round shouting ""Indy"" every five minutes and Willie screaming every other minute, it just grates a little sometimes. And that's a shame, because there are some good bits in here. Return jokes from the first film, Indiana as a hero and not just a treasure seeker and some of the stunts and action are fantastic, the mine cart chase will live in legend for centuries.I think it's sad that they introduced Short Round and made the lead female a damsel in distress, to me it feels a tad gimmicky, trying to boost the viewers or something else.There's also a lot of bits in this one that are all a bit convenient or hard to believe. Why on earth would he take Willie with him in the first place for instance? He wasn't rescuing her? Lao Che wouldn't have killed her for her part in the fight?
The clues are all just a bit laid out easily to be found.It is still a good story though and it will always be watched as part of the quadrilogy.

He then stumbles upon a secret cult committing enslavement and human sacrifices in the catacombs of an ancient palace.What I really like about this movie is though fundamentally it's a kids film it perilous enough to have adults involved.Sure there is some racial stereotyping but I'm sure that only offended the woke brigade and no one else .Ke Huy Quan is brilliant as short . A fantastic companion for Indie .I'm not so convinced about Kate Capshaw as the love interest. I found the character annoying , a little bit like Kathleen Turner in Romancing The Stone .I've not seen the next two ( soon to be three) Indiana Jones films but I am planning to do so and if they are anywhere near as good as this I'm in for a treat .",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
105,onepotato2,juvenile hell-pit,1,16 February 2009,"This movie is proof that directors often don't understand their own franchises. Although Lucas has offered regrets for this bomb, it's the Spielbergian touches that make it so irritating. Claims that audiences were turned off because it was darker than the original are just goofy. This material was risible because it was infinitely more juvenile than what people expected.First they abandon real-world historical/biblical artifacts to make room for the crappiest MacGuffin to make people ever run around a movie (magic stones!?). We get antics in place of thrills; a bug and critter dinner menu (!?) a sequence with Capshaw frightened of everything. We get Kate Capshaw, shrieking and being girly until viewers pray for a character to put her out of our misery. We get Spielberg foisting crowds of children onto us when the first movie was blissfully free of children. Here, a kid is the shrieking protagonist (Short Round), kids are the victims (hordes of kidnapped & enslaved kiddies) and a kid is the villain (Prince something-or-other). And as the final disgrace, Spielberg can't bring himself to kill the kid villain and just has him demure & apologize the exact moment moral balance is restored. Terrible scripting. We get kids on screen for 95 percent of its running time, and a Spielbergian kiddie exodus provides the limp, hokey finale.To wash it all down we get a forgettable, conventional death for a seriously uninteresting villain.

I still love it for the same reasons I always have, but in some ways, this is not the best one.As Indiana Jones' first adventure, he, a nightclub singer (Capshaw), and Chinese orphan (Quan) attempt to scurry away from some shady business men in a deal-gone-wrong.

They then make their way to a richer area in India to retrieve the rock and free the kids, where they come across horrors that they will likely not escape. While Cate Capshaw is a good actress, her character sucks. All she does is whine in bitch throughout the whole movie that is bound to annoy some viewers. I was after a while. While Short Round is a funny little character, I could understand why some of the harsher critics would find him annoying too. There are some moments that are very unrealistic, even more than the others. But they are done so well, why complain? But what I would say the biggest flaw this movie has is having the least complex story of all four movies. Crystal Skull is the worst movie that tried to have a complex story that wound up being too confusing. They should have taken the safe way out by having a lenient story like this. Come to think about it, a simple story isn't much of a flaw when looked at alone, just when compared to the others. This is the reason I would not call this the best Indiana Jones movie anymore. However, I still do think that this one does the best job in showing Indy at his strongest and why he is film's best hero. Upon entering the temple, horrors from demonic and evil rituals are unleashed, making it the scariest in the series. There is lots at stake with certain death, making you wonder if anybody can make it. Knowing Indiana Jones, you know he will find a way. In the others, he fights Nazis with little horror involved. This makes for a change in filming and more for Indy at his most heroic. This is why I think that this has the best action and adventure bits.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

With the trade out in female co-leads, Willie is an annoying if not irritating character and the movie might actually be improved if you just edited her out of the movie.Short-Round is fun, but not to any degree to go as far as saving the movie.

I can't count the number of times that I had a smile on my face while I was watching it. It was filled with the kinds of moments where I was worried for the fates of our heroes and wondering how in the world they would survive the terrible danger that they were in. From the memorable and complicated intro, to the happy ending, I was having a very good time. The tone of Temple of Doom is very different from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There are a few very dark scenes that I never expected to see before I watched the movie. Short Round and Willie made excellent comrades for Indy, and turned out to be much more than the annoying sidekicks that I was expecting. Overall, I found it to be funnier, more enthralling, and more exciting that the first Indiana Jones movie ever was.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

In order to accomplish such a pastiche, innovations had to be minor and non-threatening to the original formula being used.With """"Temple"", Spielberg decided to break the mold that George Lucas had imposed on him. ""Temple"" is derived from the ""A"" grade adventure films of the '30s and '40s, like George Stevens' ""Gunga Din"" or the Sabu version of ""The Jungle Book"". This allows Spielberg to interject considerable doses of comic relief; and it also allows him to take innovative risks, most appearing in the final third of the film, like the roller-coaster mining cart ride. Interestingly, Spielberg's introduction of these innovations appears to have been intended to make sure the film appealed to the same audience as did ""Raiders"", who would be expecting a B-movie pastiche and unlikely to catch the A-movie references of the first two thirds. Unfortunately, while the innovations are fun on their own terms, they actually missed their intended audience, while confusing others (like myself, originally) who thought they were just too 'over-the-top'.But time and proper attention does justice to this film. while not in the same class as ""Gunga Din"", it is certainly entertaining on its own term - and really must be taken on its own, and not viewed as a sequel to ""Raiders"". On its own, it is really a witty adult's fantasy with some childish play tossed in for the off-beat, gelling into a loopy but amusing visit to a fictional Orient. To be taken only half-seriously.Quite a bit of real fun here.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

A huge fight ensues as he searches desperately for a vial containing the antidote, in a D.O.A.-inspired opening.Unfortunately, after finding that vial of antidote in the decent enough intro, the vile film proper begins, as Jones and constantly whining sidekick Willie, and obnoxious little kid Short Round (oh please) endure all sorts of grotesqueries in their search for ... some rocks. Rocks? No fun at all, this film degenerates into nothing more than a seemingly never-ending series of repulsive, horrifying events (heart-ripping, kidnappings and child sacrifice, and enduring rooms full of bugs and tarantulas and creatures which have not yet been named crawling over people) for a couple of rocks? Are you kidding me? In the previous film, they found the Ark of the Covenant. Granted, it ends up being locked away in a huge warehouse, probably to never be seen again, but they found the Ark of the Covenant! There was a sense of wonder and accomplishment there.Here, nothing.Gone is the (slight) realism of Indy's quest for a historical Biblical object- in its place now, is the horrible doom and gloom of one of the lamest MacGuffins imaginable: rocks in an underground temple, being horded by a wholly forgettable villain.John Rhys-Davies' character (Sallah) is sorely missed, but I doubt even he could have done much to salvage this material.I'm sorry to keep bringing this up, but rocks?

They also discovered the great mysterious terror surrounding a booby-trapped temple known as the Temple of Doom! Thuggee is beginning to attempt to rise once more, believing that with the power of all five Sankara stones they can rule the world! Now, it's all up to Indiana to put an end to the Thuggee campaign, rescue the lost children, win the girl, and conquer the Temple of Doom.Right from the beginning, you'll know that this sequel will be bigger and much grander than the first film. The visuals in here are fantastic, not to mention the action scenes, and the light humor throughout the film! This is surly as entertaining and as good as it's predecessor.Now, I really enjoyed this film. I loved it from beginning to end. In here, you'll find it to be more or less darker and more or less lighter than the original. I don't know what to say about that, though. This is obviously the most disgusting in the trilogy and well, you'll see why when you see the movie.The sidekicks in here are a bit weird. One is an Asian kid, played by Jonathan Ke Quan, who well, doesn't seem to fit in the movie but you won't mind it when he shoots jokes at every scene he's in. The other is played by Kate Capshaw, who also provide a lot of laughs and eye candy.Apart from that, the set pieces in here are bigger and better. The special effects are done really well.

Field's classic! The grossest banquet in history at the boy-shah's palace. Eyeballs and chilled monkey brains. Moving insects for dinner! Fantastic sets and a fabulous ""legend of the enchanted stones"" that must be returned to the native people to restore peace and harmony. Non-stop action from the beginning to the end. The shaman that pulls beating hearts from his victim's chests as they explode and burn up as fireballs! Many memorable and nightmarish scenarios. The best roller coaster mine ride ever filmed.

115,sme_no_densetsu,An underrated Indiana Jones adventure,8,11 March 2009,"""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" was the second Indiana Jones film helmed by Steven Spielberg. In it, Jones finds himself in India and sets out in search of a mysterious stone that may be linked to a resurgence of the Thuggee cult.The tone is a bit darker than the first film, which may be one reason why it is not as highly regarded. Another reason may be the choice of Jones's companions this time around.Kate Capshaw (later Mrs. Steven Spielberg) plays a lounge singer who typifies the 'damsel in distress' role while young Jonathon Ke Quan plays 'Short Round', a sort of sidekick for Indy. I don't mind these characters at all but I can see how others might find them irritating.As before, Harrison Ford excels in the lead role and here his character is developed even further. There's not much worth noting in terms of supporting roles but the cast and their performances are uniformly dependable.Spielberg's direction is expertly handled and I think that the film looks better than the first in the series. While there are a few visual effects that don't quite measure up, the overall presentation is attractive. John Williams contributes the score once again, which incorporates the classic theme first heard in the previous film. Again he was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for his work.Overall, I think that this film is a worthy follow-up to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".

There's more humour in the story, thanks to Kate Capshaw who plays a ditzy blonde whose vocabulary rarely goes beyond ""Oh my God, oh no, Indy!!!"", but she's so funny. Checkout the temple banquet scene - the best part - where the food is, eh, quite different. Of course, the humour takes a backseat in the middle of the film when Indiana is put under a spell by thuggie priest ( played menacingly by Amrish Puri, which is great piece of casting), and things take a dark turn, and it's here where things get bogged down a little. But not for long - Indiana ends up fighting a thug, and there's a non-stop chase sequence over the tunnel rails. Just stunning work. The action is well-staged and pulls no punches to deliver thrills. The finale is just heart stopping at the bridge severs in half with the protagonists and antagonist hanging for dear life while crocs chomping underneath them.Temple of Doom is seen as a lesser entry, but it's my favourite one with smacks of top humour, great cinematography, action, intensity and solid story. Sure it has a dark, macabre tone, but that is all balanced out by the comedic moments, which mainly comes from Kate Capshaw's spoofy exaggeration of a ditzy blonde. I don't find her irritating at all. Nor do I find it racist as the depiction of Indian culture is poking fun at the oriental views of India (exotic temples, and the exotic culinary choice at the banquet.), and presented into an over exaggerated dark humour.

118,pyrocitor,Inconsistent yet vastly entertaining and intriguingly experimental adventure romp,8,17 June 2009,"If there is anything worse for a film than living up to the expectations of a rapturously received predecessor, it is attempting to remain valid amidst a shroud of cultural degradation and dismissal. Sadly, legendary director Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom proved subject to both. Riding on the heels of the enormously successful Raiders of the Lost Ark, Spielberg's sequel remains frequently ignored or ridiculed amongst the rest of the series as ""the bad one"" (now arguably superseded by critical scorn towards recent Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) or (justifiably) ""the one too scary for kids"". Nonetheless, such an unfavourable reputation appears a case of years of cultural referencing overshadowing the film itself, as Temple of Doom manages to not only hold its own against (if not outright match up to) the first and third Jones films in terms of shameless fun factor, but also offers enough intriguingly unique elements to make it well worth repeat viewings, despite initial skepticism.While the singular most common sequel clause is to ""go darker"", Spielberg paradoxically embraces both this maxim and its polar opposite. Just as often as Temple of Doom unsettles with its disturbingly intense, harrowing and painfully topical subject matter (child abduction and slavery and satanic cult worship somewhat step up the ""MacGuffin"" stakes...) and vicious violence, Spielberg opts for extremely broad, often juvenile humour, as if in a rushed attempt to cancel out both extremes and arrive at a happy medium. Instead, the two tonal opposites only serve to enunciate the excesses of both, making the picture feel inconsistent and lacking a clear demographic (just as children would flinch from seeing a heart ripped from a body, adults would only groan at animal and gross-out food jokes). But somehow Spielberg manages to rein in the entire picture short of becoming a chaotic mess and retains his winning flair for compelling, unavoidably enjoyable storytelling enough to wrangle a supremely entertaining film out of it. The film maintains such a rapid pace and with such enthusiasm that its audience is more or less forced to resign to the delirious fun factor of it all.In fact, in some odd way, the hectic tonal imbalances feel somewhat fitting for what appears to be in many ways Spielberg's most whimsical entry into the Jones series, exercising an uncommonly cheeky wit and madcap exuberance. Forgoing the usual slow, expository sequences at Jones' university, the film begins with an exquisitely self-referential bang, subverting viewer expectations by opening with a 1930s style musical number in favour of a jungle chase and paying homage to the franchise's inspiration with a superb James Bond spoof. And the pace hardly slows afterwards, displacing the action to sumptuously scenic (allegedly) India, and providing a seemingly endless supply of chases, scares and exhilarating fights. And while the cheese factor remains strong, seemingly flaunting its myriad of clichéd circumstances rather than attempting to conceal them, the film's unabashedly tongue in cheek exuberance makes it exceedingly difficult not to warm to, making the film just as likely to evoke cheers from every audience member regardless of age or cinematic cynicism. Spielberg also continues his apparent experimental streak by infusing the film with an uncommonly sturdy technical foundation. While the film's predecessor and successor often demonstrated cheerfully clunky technical work so as to not distract from the breathless adventure in store, it is easy to overlook how surprisingly technically proficient Temple of Doom is. Normally innocuous, Spielberg's cameras move fluidly, often quite artistically and incessantly, whether breathlessly zooming down vertical surfaces to amplify the tension to uncomfortable levels or utilising cold hard close ups to punctuate claustrophobic unease with gleeful, unhinged energy and vitality. Similarly, Spielberg demonstrates a fantastic use of dramatic lighting, casting gaping shadows over seedy antagonists and a dramatic dull glow over the most hopeless of sequences, amplifying the infectious emotional component with hard worn ease. It of course goes without saying that John Williams' triumphantly grandiose musical score lifts the film's quality exponentially, maintaining that even at its darkest moments the film remains an Indiana Jones film, and thus larger than life and near impossible to dislike. As such, the majority of the film's more glaring errors in judgement lie on the performance front. While Harrison Ford remains near charismatic perfection rekindling the immortal Indiana Jones figure, his discomfort during the film's sillier bits is visible. Nonetheless, Ford is also given the chance to flex dramatic muscles as the film darkens, including a transition into entranced evil akin to a drug withdrawal scene, made extremely difficult watching by Ford's gritty dedication to the performance. As such, given the film's exceptional central performance, it is the characters left for Jones to play off of which dampen the film's enjoyment factor. In fact, the majority of the blame can be devoted to Kate Capshaw's legendarily embarrassing damsel in distress rendition, a wasted mess of excruciating screams, whining and bungled comic relief moments. And while similar infamy has been bestowed upon Jonathan Ke Quan's 'Short Round', surprisingly he manages to mostly supersede racial stereotyping and an irritating amount of screen presence with an admirable charisma and charm (though a fair amount of overdone comic schtick prevails nonetheless). Thankfully, Amrish Puri makes an utterly horrifying and gruesomely memorable antagonist as the sinister cult leader, perfectly mixing a wide eyed, maniacal cackle with a disturbingly level headed, darkly suave charm.While potentially alienating to those more familiar with the series' more consistent family friendly tone, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is spilling over with enough fun, frights and laughs to make it a near irresistible watch. Reputation aside, the film is a joyful watch worth experiencing by all. -8/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
119,Maciste_Brother,PG 13 Hell!,1,7 June 2009,"INDIANA JONE AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is the film that basically gave birth to the creatively stifling PG-13 rating that's been the bane of the movie industry ever since. When TEMPLE OF DOOM was released, many complained that the film was too violent for a PG-rated film and the MPAA subsequently created the PG-13 rating to calm parents and watchdogs. Now, ever since its implementation movies have basically sucked. R-rated films, which were common in the 1970s and early 1980s, suddenly started disappearing from theater screens as Hollywood preferred having/making films for 12 year old boys than creating amazing thought provoking films that often end up being rated R, whether it's for bad language, violence or sex or simply because of its subject matter. The quality of movies has been going downhill since then and today movies are mostly disposable junk, peddled endlessly to young boys who know very little about quality acting, storytelling or emotions. And it's all thanks to INDIANA JONE AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.As for the movie itself, I recently watched it in Hi-Def and it's as embarrassing today as it was when it was originally released. Terrible script, terrible acting, terribly forced action with a racist tone to it all.

124,TheUnknown837-1,"My impression was that Spielberg had finally directed a movie he didn't want to even see, let alone make",5,7 November 2012,"""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" was directed by one of the most talented men in Hollywood today, but it's very hard to tell by what has been finally put on the screen. Sure, the Steven Spielberg technique and flair is ever-present; on a technically level, the movie is superbly done. Hence why the movie's two high points, fatally placed at opposite ends of each other, do ring so powerfully, and unsuccessfully coerced me into forgiving the utter boredom that I suffered through in the middle. Spielberg's hand is present in the second Indiana Jones film, but his heart is missing.The movie gets off on the wrong foot very early on, after a rousing and clever opening sequence set in Shanghai. Then, toward the end, in a fantastic climax set upon a rickety old bridge spanning a chasm, it regains the momentum and joy of filmmaking that made ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" among other Spielberg films, so strong. It is here that ""Temple of Doom"" accomplishes what its predecessor did: recalling the admittedly cheesy but nevertheless lovable Republic serials of the days gone by. Shootouts in big fancy casinos, with MacGuffins from opposite parties being exchanged via a turning table for drinks. Bad guys trapping our hero over a chasm, leaving him no choice but to cut the rope and take whatever chance he has left. And, in the tradition of those serials, we have crocodiles waiting at the bottom.So amazingly enough, ""Temple of Doom"" soars whenever it stays out of the Temple of Doom. For once Indiana Jones and his two sidekicks, and obnoxious singer (Kate Capshaw) and an kid from Shanghai (Jonathan Ke Quan) start traveling into that booby trap-filled pyramid—the point where we would expect the movie to really get moving—everything begins to drag. And although I do compliment Spielberg for delivering the movie's best moments, I also shell him some blame for accepting the screenplay handed to him. One of the best things about ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was that both Spielberg and the screenplay had the same goal. Here, they split paths. The director wanted to continue the tradition of the Republic serials; the screenwriters wanted to make a dopey mishmash of kiddy comedy and gruesome terror. Everything that takes place inside the titular temple plays against each other. It includes scenes where Kate Capshaw is served movie-Indian food (in other words, grotesque bugs that are still living) and she attempts not to gag and is then contrasted with voodoo sacrifices, where the victim's heart is, right before our eyes, ripped out, and the body is thrown into a pit of magma. The screenplay handles these negatively conflicting attitudes with no discipline, resulting in a frantic, schizophrenic demeanor.Is it not a coincidence that the two people who wrote ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, would, two years later, write the screenplay for another unpleasantly mean-spirited movie that would attempt to ram kid comedy with grotesque horror together? The hinted-at catastrophe: ""Howard the Duck."" That is where ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" goes so wrong: the unwillingness of the screenwriters to pick a mood and go with it. Harrison Ford is his usual charming self as the titular adventurer, but he's got nobody interesting to tag along with him. And in a movie like this, the hero can only be about as interesting as the adventure he is given to undertake. Dodging the Nazis while searching for religious artifacts worked before and after this movie, but running from voodoo practitioners and being hypnotized into nearly through a comrade into the core of the earth is not what I had in mind for an Indiana Jones adventure. The villains are memorable, but for all the wrong reasons. And his sidekicks are utterly obnoxious. It is hard to tell from this movie that Kate Capshaw is a talented actress. Her squealing and whining goes a long way and really fast. And it is no big wonder why Jonathan Ka Quan, as the little kid, never had a kickoff career. Yes, he was just a kid when making this picture, but there is none of that real spark the audience looks for in a character we're meant to root for.I wanted more of the traditional stuff when the movie goes into the temple. More booby traps, more trying to figure out how to escape, more fights where the hero has to worry more about being shot or impaled as opposed to being burned alive (because the former can be dealt with in a way that is not unpleasantly gruesome in a movie meant to be joyously enjoyable), and a lot less of the mean-spirited material we get in this installment of the series. In watching ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" I was overcome with this horrible sensation that I never before felt about a Steven Spielberg film: he made a movie he probably would have never wanted to see.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
125,baumer,This is the ultimate movie character!,9,27 December 1999,"Indiana Jones is one the most unique film characters ever created.  He is not a superhero, he is not incredibly well built and he does not exhibit Einstein like smarts.However, he does have is the most relentless desire to succeed and never give up.  He started that in Raiders of the Lost Ark and he continues it in Temple of Doom.  I once saw an interview with Steven Spielberg years after Temple was released.  He was being asked about Temple of Doom and he said that when him and George Lucas looked at the screenplay for Temple of Doom Steven turned to George and asked him if they could do all that was written.  George turned back to him and said "" I have no idea. ""  But they started filming and when it came to doing what seemed to be the impossible, they somehow managed to do it.  Because that is what you get when you put two of the greatest minds in the business today together, success.  Reality says that there are limitations to what can be done.  Steven and George take that reality and laugh at it.  Maybe now a days, some 16 years later, things like the mine care chase and the pit of fire seem like simple things to film but remember this is 1984.  Special effects were not as advanced as they are now and to create some of what they did is realy quite incredible.  I don't know how long it must have taken to film the mine cart scene but think of difficult and arduos a process that would be.  Spielberg will always be the king of motion pictures in my book and films like this helped solidify that title.  The man is a genius, he really is.  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a fantastic film and it furthers his character.  The film isn't just a rehash of the first, it actually expands on the story.  And to make it even more fun, it takes place before the events in Raiders do.One of the most entertaining parts of Temple of Doom is Indy's new sidekick named Short Round, Shorty for short.  Ke Huy Quan plays shorty with so much energy and he becomes an integral part of the film.  He has a few good one liners and his physical acting skills are a perfect match for Harrison Fords.  The film starts off much in the same way that Raiders does, with something that really has little to do with the rest of the film.  It is here that we are introduced to Indy once again, Willie Scott, the beautiful nightclub singer, Short Round and even to one of Indy's old friends named Mohan, who loses his life abruptly.  The reason I mention Mohan is because Marion had a friend named Mohan at her bar in Nepal.  I wonder if these two guys were related somehow.After the energy at the beginning of the film it slows down to explain the story and set it up for us.  But from the moment Indy and Short Round go into the secret wall in their room, the film never slows down.  It is from here that we witness all the things that we now expect from an Indiana Jones movie:  boobie traps, evil bad guys, bugs, perilous turns at every corner and of course the bullwhip.  Some of the funniest parts in the film are also when Indy and Shorty are stuck in the cavern with the ceiling slowly caving in on them.  Willie can hear their screams of help and she has to come and rescue them.  She gingerly and slowly walks down the cave and gets to them. As she puts her hand into the hole in the wall to release them, Indy sticks his hand out and says ""the other right, the other right, your other right. "" and then just before they are about to be crushed he looks at her and with a child like face he says "" Willie, we are going to die! ""  It is such a funny moment that if you haven't seen Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom then you should just for this one part.  Temple of Doom is so full of energy and action that it is definitely a film ahead of its time.  People complained that the film was too violent and that it wasn't suitable for kids so they actually changed the rating system in the U.S for this movie.  PG-13 was born just for Temple of Doom. Interesting piece of trivia there for you.As for the movie itself, Indiana Jones becomes somewhat of a deity to some villagers outside of Shanghai.  They have lost their three stones that supposedly bring good luck to the village.  They also have their children kidnapped by the Thugees, led by a nasty villain named Mola Rom.  He is a human sacrificing menacing man that pulls people's hearts out of their chest just before he lowers them into a hellacious pit of fire as a human sacrifice to Sheeba.  Indy is then captured and put under a spell by having to drink some blood.  It is here that the movie gets it's PG-13 rating when not only Indy but Short Round are whipped with the cat-o-nine tails.  It is quite disturbing and I guess if kids were going to watch the film it would be a bit much for them.  Temple of Doom is a great film and it is a great sequel to Raiders and a perfect prequel to Last Crusade.  It remembers its roots as it has Indy reaching for his gun in a dangerous situation only to find that it is not there and it creates some of its own new history as there are many breath taking action sequences.  I don't know how George and Steven do it but they just keep on entertaining us with movies like this and Star Wars.  I sincerely hope they make a fourth installment of the Indiana Jones series. It has been ten years since the last one and that is way too long.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

127,jeremycrimsonfox,A Great Prequel That Helped Create A Rating,8,28 February 2019,"Some people say Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom is the worst movie of the franchise so far. To me, the worst is basically Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. This movie is not perfect, but it's still good.Set before the events of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Indiana Jones is tasked by a village to help them after he escapes a Triad group after a deal gone wrong. Joined by singer Willie and young sidekick Short Round, Indy goes to Pankot Palace, where he discovers a hidden temple where a Thuggee cult, led by Mola Ram, has the stones the village asked him to return, and has even enslaved the kids of said village to mine for the last two.Yeah, this movie is very violent, as it has some scenes that at the time, would be so brutal, some parents complained the movie should have been rated R. This, alongside the outrage of how violent first Gremlins movie was, would influence Steven Spielberg, who was involved with both movies, to suggest the PG-13 rating as an in-between rating. Also, the film is controversial for how it portrayed the country of India, causing the film to be banned from the country temporarily.Despite those controversies, the film is interesting. It has the same exciting action as the first movie (like the famous mine cart chase scene), and even some goofy moments, making Temple of Doom one of my favorite films.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
128,hnt_dnl,My FAVORITE Indiana Jones film!,10,20 November 2009,"Very rarely do I enjoy a sequel more than an original, but this is a rare case where I totally prefer a sequel (actually prequel). Steven Spielberg's INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM(1984) is one of the most purely enjoyable movie-watching experiences I've ever had! An amazingly ""original"" opening musical number in the Chinese nightclub that introduces the film with the classic tune ""Anything Goes"" is sung by the flick's heroine. The amazing part is that you don't have to like musicals to like this wonderfully choreographed sequence. It's an appropriate tune, too, because in this movie, ANYTHING GOES!Temple of Doom is full of nonstop chills and thrills, has an ever-present comic and screwball mood and tone, and one of the most over-the-top, juicy villains you'll ever lay eyes on! While ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has moments where it slows down to the point of being rather tedious, TOD is never boring. It doesn't slow down at all. It may be convoluted as hell (and Raiders wasn't?), but it actually doesn't take itself seriously as both Raiders and The Last Crusade, which to me was more a detriment than a plus for those films. TOD is 100% pure entertainment. Spielberg generates a high amount of humor from perfectly placed and timed doses of John Williams magnificent score, which furiously moves along with the plot.Harrison Ford is not really amongst my favorite stars, but I totally love his work in this. I like the fact that Indy is solely in the Far East (China and India) in this one and there aren't those stunted scenes of him at that boring university in the first and third movie. It allows for him to be all action, all the time. THIS is the film that highlights all the best aspects of Indy: swashbuckling, funny, ambitious, charming.Ford is ably supported by Kate Capshaw (as singer Willie, who sung the opening tune) and Ke Huy Quan (as Indy's sidekick Short Round). I get the sense that Willie and Short Round are thought of as annoying characters, but for the tone of this film, their over-the-topness is totally necessary. The flick wouldn't be as funny without them. Willie is the perfect sexual foil for Indy in a movie like this. She's a total FEMALE, always concerned with her makeup, looks, clothes, and Capshaw makes the most of a role with rather limited range potential. She's funny, sexy, and, thankfully...agile! Quan's Short Round is a very original character, a kid that has a monster role in a blockbuster flick and without him, this flick doesn't work, especially with the childlike elements that permeate the film. Even kids of today would love Short Round the way kids in 1984 did when this film came out.TOD has a pure escapist tone and feel to it that simply makes it a MOVIE and not so much a FILM. The Thugee cult stuff is crazy as all get out, but somehow, Spielberg makes it highly scary, tense, and apocalyptic. Really extraordinary that the dichotomy of comedy and horror mix to perfection in this film. One of Spielberg's most underrated accomplishments as a director. The finale is a literal roller-coaster ride. ""Raiders"" actually ended on a whimper. TOD is a bona fide winner all on it's own, prequel or sequel!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
129,sharky_55,"Relax, I've been giving him lessons.",7,22 February 2016,"This feels like an Indy film, no? It has all those ingredients that made arguably the greatest action thriller of all time with Raiders. Then again, it is darker and more violent, and pushes our characters to these extremes that almost push it out of the pulpy action range that the franchise is built upon. There is still the wisecracking Indy, radiating personality with each sweaty grin, wink and seductive glare. There is still those bits of classic Indy humour; Ford grinning and making his getaway before swinging the door to reveal the villain's name, and him fumbling around with a statue's bust while a bewildered Willie stares at him. And there those wild, exotic and mysterious locations that harbour hidden treasures and lost secrets...well maybe one large location. There's the Karen Allen type female sidekick, full of moxie and unresolved tension and annoying screams...wait. For me, the draw of Indiana Jones is in the multi-level adventure, the mystery behind the treasure hunting and the subsequent search and chase across crazy and wild landscapes and cultures...why else would the graphic of the plane flying around the world from country to country be so iconic? In Temple of Doom, this happens once near the beginning, and then we are mostly stuck in a dark temple for most of the film, battling away terrors and running from minions. For all the thrilling chase and action sequences, it feels a little static, as if they were running around in circles inside a bobby trapped haunted house. The iconic Raiders March somehow manages to shoehorns its way into the action throughout, but it never quite feels like Indy. The other criticism that seems to be pervasive whenever this movie is mentioned is of course the sidekick characters of Willie and Short Round. While Temple may be darker, more graphic and throw even more precious dilemmas for Indy to deal with, these two 'comic relief' types are oddly inappropriate. Capshaw is intriguingly beautiful and intoxicating for about a minute during the opening sequence, and then descends into a whiny, high-pitched damsel in distress for the rest of the two hours. There's none of the greed or ulterior motive of Elsa, or the playful resourcefulness of Marion; she's simply a blonde bombshell constantly in the need of rescue and the designated romance 'doll' who feels the need to shriek at the sight of a cracked nail. Shorty is slightly less insufferable - he scurries from scene to scene and actually manages to assist Indy in his daring, death-defying stunts and exploits. It's his running commentary in broken, simplistic English that is rather grating. It's goofy, juvenile and downright silly at times, and manages to jarringly break up the tension; he runs onto a frail bridge, jumps animatedly up and down and yells ""Strong wood! Strong wood!"". And of course the next second it must collapse. While it may not be a great Indiana Jones movie like the ones immediately preceding and proceeding, and despite these shortcomings, Temple is still enjoyable. The production design lavishly tells the story of a great palace hidden away in the jungle, and a nightmarish temple full of great horrors like torture cages and mines full of slaves, bathed in an ominous reddish glow. The cinematography eases us into the mystery like an enthusiastic yet cautious archaeologist would, only burdened by the rather distasteful portrayals of the Indian natives; the camera takes tentative steps forward, brushing past vines and leaves to unveil a great weathered stone figure, grotesque in its age and décor, but the moment is offset by the natives exploding into fearful frenzy and fleeing for their lives. Ford sells each predicament so well that we can ignore the others and focus on him, and the danger that he approaches with a boyish, adventurous streak that we hope we possess too.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
130,Beta_Gallinger,"Highly entertaining for the first hour or so, but eventually gets too dark and disturbing",6,12 November 2009,"Three years after release of the classic ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (the first installment in the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise), it was followed by this prequel, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"". I just got around to watching the 1981 original a couple weeks ago, believe it or not, and could understand why it was such a popular action adventure. Before watching this second film, I knew the first was the most popular in the series, and this one was the least popular of the first three, but that didn't mean I wasn't going to watch it. For over 50% of the film, I found that it wasn't as good as ""Raiders"", but still very entertaining. However, I had been warned that it was darker and more violent than its predecessor, which eventually began to make a lot of sense! In 1935, Indiana Jones makes a trade with Chinese crime boss Lao Che in a nightclub in Shanghai, but the gangsters want to kill the archaeologist! He narrowly escapes with nightclub singer Wilhelmina ""Willie"" Scott, and with the help of his sidekick, a young Chinese boy named Short Round. The three of them leave Shanghai on a plane, unaware that it belongs to Lao Che! While they are asleep, the pilots get off the plane, leaving the three in peril! Indy, Willie, and Shorty escape the plane in an inflatable boat, landing on the slope of the Himalayas and sliding down into a river! They come to a village in India, where a sacred stone has been stolen and all the children are missing! The people believe that evil spirits are responsible for this, and the trio venture into a nearby palace to save the kids and retrieve the stone, but are headed for a terrifying experience! This prequel starts out showing Willie Scott, played by Kate Capshaw, performing, which is a lot different from the beginning or ""Raiders"", and I did not care much for it. After that, it gets better, with Indiana talking to Lao Che. This is where the suspense begins, and Harrison Ford still is charismatic as Indy. I quickly realized that Willie Scott is not a very good comic relief. I didn't find her as annoying as many others probably have, but didn't think she was that funny, constantly freaking out and complaining, and sometimes screaming a lot, like when she keeps seeing one jungle creature after another. Still, there are some mildly amusing parts, as this character does have her moments, and so does Short Round, played by Jonathan Ke Quan. For a long time, the film succeeds as an action adventure, with great action scenes, consistent suspense, and some nice special effects and sets, much like its predecessor. However, we eventually see a man getting his heart magically pulled out before he is lowered into a pit of lava, and then we hear screams as we see child slaves mercilessly lashed while they are forced to toil in the horrible underground chamber! Starting here, the film isn't so entertaining anymore.To me, the first hour of this movie seemed to go surprisingly fast, but after the brutality starts, the film drags a little. If it hadn't made this sudden change, I would at least be able to give this ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" prequel an 8/10. A highly entertaining action adventure turning into what is more like a brutal drama (with the child slavery scenes) is kind of like a mean trick! As a movie billed as an action adventure, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is obviously supposed to be fun, not a film to remind us of the cruelty of humanity! Don't let the PG rating fool you. Kids should not watch this movie with or without their parents! Apparently, it was one of the films that inspired the creation of the PG-13 rating, which is not surprising. I guess there was nothing in between PG and R before then, and of those two, ""Temple of Doom"" probably would have been better off with an R rating. So, while this film does have some good entertainment value, no wonder it's the least popular installment in the original trilogy!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
131,vip_ebriega,A very underrated sequel to the classic film.,10,21 May 2008,"My Take: While darker than the classic RAIDERS, this in-your-face thrill-ride will leave you breathless. Usually compared to its superior predecessor and often criticized for being not as good, INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is an immensely enjoyable and unfairly maligned sequel that's just as good as the original. How many sequels are like that, in fact, how many sequels even live up to its predecessors. DOOM, with its darker more violent approach, shows the film's aim for difference. For most parts, it succeeded very well, I see no reason why a simple change of pace could go wrong. This is a good and enjoyable sequel, and I'm glad to be pushing it that far.Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones once more who crashes into India after a highly enjoyable Shanghai club brawl. Along for the ride is sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) and noisy Nightclub singer Willie Scott (future Mrs. Spielberg Kate Capshaw). They end up in a village struck by hardship and famine when their magical sacred stones called the Sankara were stolen by an evil Thuggee Cult. Indy and gang end up trying to save the village, as well as fighting against a wily bunch of evil worshipers and an evil cult leader (Amrish Puri). And much like the first film, director Steven Spielberg has tons of fun with special effects and action sequences, and we're guaranteed to join in the fun.The new screenwriters here in DOOM, Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, lack the true edge of the original screenwriters of the first film, Phil Kaufman and Lawrence Kasdan. But the result is still a fun film, a fast-paced excursion filled with dazzling inventiveness and creative imaginations. This is just what made the first film great entertainment, and this is what made this one a terrific sequel to a great original.Followed by INDIANA JONES & THE LAST CRUSADE.Rating: ***** out of 5.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
132,one9eighty,No time for love Dr Jones!,8,9 August 2017,"Dr Henry 'Indiana' Jones is back - albeit in a sequel that acts as a prequel! It's 1935, teaming up with a club singer called 'Willie' and a twelve year old boy (Short Round) after a deal gone wrong Indiana tries to uncover the secrets of, and escape the temple of Doom. Queue another great and epic adventure filled with excitement, action, thrills, spills, laughs and a bit of romance too. Again directed by Spielberg with a John Williams score the audience is treated to a thrill a minute. I'd suggest that the pace of this film is sharper than ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"", and the content a tiny bit darker too, especially towards the end when it looks like Indy has turned heel. Censors at the time used this movie to bring out the PG-13 classification because it was a little too dark for young children. It's still really enjoyable though and modern audiences wouldn't bat an eye lid at the content on screen. While it's not the favorite Indy film for some reviewers it's still amongst the best adventure movies ever made and is as good today as it was at release. Perhaps the negative reviewers expected too much when in fact the film was still trying to establish the archaeologist turned adventurer to the masses by telling a back story. OK, so some elements of the film live out stereotypes which by today's standards could be misconstrued as sexist or racist, but rather than look for meaning that deep just view it as a comic adventure like it's supposed to be. The film isn't a critique about skin colour, gender, or greed, it's a start to finish adventure straight from the pages of a childlike and innocent mind.If you want to watch a fun movie then you need look no further.

133,educallejero,One scandalous step back,1,23 July 2020,"The protagonist doesn't evolve an inch.
The female character goes from really great in the first one, to the typical annoying damsel in distress in this sequel.
And to make the movie more childish (the first one had plenty of childish that contradicted the overall serious tone), they added up a child to the main cast. Why an asian kid is helping Indiana Jones around the world? Not explained. The kid is comic relief and something for the younger viewers.Besides all that, the directing in this one sucks pretty hard, with ridiculous action sequences way too over the top, blowing away with the ones in the original, plus too many way too long and boring passages of pure boring and ridiculous pointless exposition.This was a disaster.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
134,dglink,Disappointing Sequel,5,1 February 2016,"A childish film that is not for children, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is the least by far of the four Indiana Jones movies. However, the opening sequences are terrific, and the film promises at first to become a first-rate sequel. Willie Scott, a cabaret singer working in Shanghai, sings ""Anything Goes"" in Chinese, backed by a glittering bevy of Asian chorus girls, while the main titles play in an around them. Moments later, Willie and Indiana Jones are sliding around the dance floor searching for an enormous diamond and a vial of poison antidote, while guns blaze, patrons flee, and a huge bucket of ice spills across the floor. Jones, Willie, and Jones's young sidekick, Short Round, soon find themselves aboard a plane heading across snowy peaks in a scene reminiscent of ""Lost Horizon."" The action is breathless and exciting, but once the threesome returns to earth, the film crash lands as well.The sequences in an Indian cult temple are gruesome at best; there is nothing entertaining in watching a heart plucked out or a man incinerated in a blazing cauldron. While the feast of the creepy crawlies is amusing at first, watching the guests of a boy Rajah relish live eels, suck out huge beetles, or sip eye-ball soup wears thin after awhile, especially with Willie mugging shamelessly throughout. However, Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, first, last, and always; and he manages to stand above the mess and emerge unscathed. On the other hand, Kate Capshaw as Willie is either giving a bad performance as a badly written character or doing what the director directed with a badly written character. Whatever, Willie is annoying, girlishly silly, talks of broken fingernails, screams at bugs and snakes, and single-handedly sets feminism back a century; viewers will long for Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood. The addition of Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round is inexplicable and adds little to the film. Indiana Jones does not need children or dumb blondes; he needs Marion Ravenwood, Sallah, Dr. Marcus Brody, and Professor Henry Jones.Fortunately, the Indiana Jones saga regained its footing with the next episode, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" because, other than a terrific opening, this misfire sequel could have put the nails in the intrepid archaeologist's coffin. The film certainly did nothing for Capshaw's career, as a glance at her resume will indicate, and Short Round's followup filmography was also quite short. Of course, book ended by two vastly superior films, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is hard to ignore, but, aside from an initial viewing for complete-ists, it is not as repeatable as the other Indiana Jones films.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Indiana Jones is one of my favourite characters of all time because of these qualities.Jones is juxtaposed with singer Willie Scott, a spoilt and supposedly sophisticated professional who learns the life of an adventure in very intriguing circumstances. Having this character allows viewers to see the difference between the high life and the poor life, which is also a very touching point to the film.Willie comes from a very classy background and when arriving in the dilapidated town, its shocking to see how she react and is very touching and audiences will sympathize with the residents of the town.Her character is very funny though, watch out for the elephant scenes.One of the greatest child roles I've ever seen, Ke Quan gives a funny and classy role as Short Round. His catchphrases and attitude towards situations are great and extremely enjoyable.The main reason this film is so brilliant is because of the situations Indy and his companions find themselves in, including planes, rope bridges, boat rides and other death defying situations. Its an astonishing mixture of action, adventure and a thrilling ride.The settings also make the film stunning, none more so than one of the final scenes which makes it one of the best action adventures of all time.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

137,DarthBill,We owe this film the PG-13 rating,7,16 December 2003,"Seriously, while it may seem tame to some people today, this was pretty nasty stuff back in 1984 and almost got the dreaded R-rating. Spielberg negotiated for a PG and later negotiated the PG-13 rating which would characterize the Batman films and what have you.We all know the plot: After nearly getting killed at the Club Obi-Wan in Shang Hai, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his sidekicks Mrs. Spielberg- I mean lounge singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) land in East India and agree to steal back three sacred stones that were stolen from a village now on its last legs. Chaos and mayhem ensues.
Many have called it the worst of the Indy trilogy and many have damned it as one of the worst sequels ever made. I don't agree that it's as bad as many people say it is, but I do agree it's not on par with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""The Last Crusade"", even though it's better than most of today's sequels (Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, The Matrix Revolutions, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, etc).Harrison Ford's still a great Indy, but he doesn't feel quite the same here. He feels more like a mercenary and not the dashing archeologist explorer we knew and loved in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Last Crusade"". Granted he has to be a little mercenarious in order to get those artifacts, but it bothers us that that's the only side of him we see here, and not the side of him that was just an everyday guy. Yeah, I know, Willie's annoying and wouldn't last in a fight against Marion or Elsa, but I don't like bashing her since so many others have already done it and a character's only as useful as she's written to be. Short Round had his moments.Plenty of stunts, but too much gore for the kiddies. If you're a parent with children, beware.

138,TOMASBBloodhound,"Ridiculous, yet ridiculously entertaining.",7,27 July 2013,"This was the most maligned Indiana Jones film until Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but like all films in this series it keeps you entertained from beginning to end. This film also caused quite an uproar with parents when it was first released. But what didn't cause one back in those days? Rumors of children being tortured in it were the greatest cause for alarm, but once the film was actually released, these criticisms seemed to die down quickly. The script is downright silly in places, and even the films darkest moments are too ridiculous to take seriously. For what ever reason, this film is actually a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Neither storyline has anything to do with one another, so I'm in the dark as to why this was done. Harrison Ford was back and kicking butt, this time in India while battling some kind of Hindu death cult operating out of a spooky palace. It seems this cult had taken a sacred stone and all the children from a nearby village to dig for additional gems and other sacred stones. Along with Jones are a little Asian kid, and a mouthy American singer babe played by the future Mrs. Spielberg. The film is relatively well-paced and full of thrilling moments. The trouble is, none of these characters and situations are in any way plausible.Spielberg and Lucas intended this film to be partly filmed on location in India, but the Indian government refused after reading the script. They claimed the filmmakers hadn't the slightest clue about their culture, and it's hard to argue when you see what they came up with. The biggest exaggeration we see here deals with the cult itself. Thuggee was a real cult responsible for untold thousands of deaths or more for several years. They did not however occupy temples with molten lava or sacrifice victims in lavish ceremonies. Thuggee were traveling thieves who ritualistically strangled fellow travelers and then robbed them. And world domination was probably never on their agenda. When Jones is attacked in his stateroom, this is likely the most accurate depiction in the movie of how a Thug would kill his victim. History aside, the film delivers both the thrills and spectacle we would want from an Indiana Jones film. John Williams broadened his familiar score and improved it by doing so. Ford was injured in the strangulation scene mentioned above and a double had to be used for him in some scenes filmed later. Keep an eye out for Dan Akroyd as a man at the airport in an early scene. Also on hand in support is Phillip Stone, a veteran of Kubrick films Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and A Clockwork Orange. Pat Roach who plays the biggest Thug also had small roles in Barry Lyndon and Clockwork. Small world, isn't it? Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a thrilling movie, but cannot in any way be taken seriously.

139,petra_ste,Beware the even-numbered Indys,6,15 July 2014,"While I've never liked Temple particularly, today it looks better in retrospect, as it is nowhere as bad as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull; action set pieces here are great, Spielberg at his top form. The big issues are plot, characters and tone.I hate the clunky James Bond opening, the unfocused way the story unfolds. A particularly smug, dense Indy escapes Shangai with the villain's own plane (why did the pilots even take off, or didn't just shoot him in the head instead of staging a plane crash, it's beyond me), randomly ends up in India, happens to visit a village whose mystical MacGuffin the horned villain has stolen... by comparison The Last Crusade looks as tightly plotted as L.A. Confidential.Kate Capshaw's obnoxious Willie destroys the good job done with the strong female character of Marion in Raiders - constantly screaming damsel in distress and fatuous femme fatale, the object of both ridicule and leering, she really is insufferable. Short Round has the dubious privilege of getting a few ""the kid saves the day"" Spielberg moments: the scene where he beats up thugs thrice his size with karate moves as a cute oriental jingle plays in the soundtrack is so childish it makes The Goonies look like Blood Meridian.Even forgetting casual racism - I'll give Spielberg and Lucas the benefit of the doubt and attribute it to silly attempts at humor rather than actual malice - tone is a mess. Doom wants to both quirky and spooky, funny and violent, dark and stupid. So we have slapstick and ""oh so funny in India they eat weird stuff"" moments, then suddenly an innocent man screams in agony as his heart is graphically ripped off his chest (note that this is the movie which is basically responsible for the creation of the PG-13 rating); ""tonally inconsistent"" doesn't quite convey it.

140,gab-14712,"A Darker, But More Entertaining Indiana Jones Film!",9,1 May 2020,"It has been known that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is my least favorite film from the original trilogy...and only by a very slim margin. Ultimately, the film is a technical triumph, a rousing adventure, and an excellent sequel to 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indiana Jones is at his best when he is fighting Nazis, but I think he does quite well fending off an evil Indian cult. Yes, the sequel (actually, it's a prequel) is plenty darker than the first film, but it all makes for a very interesting watch.When the film received its initial treatment, director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas were going through turbulent times in their lives mainly through divorces. Those dark moments represent the darker tone of the story. The duo originally wanted Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote Raiders, to return but he felt the story was too dark and unpleasant for his taste. They hired Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck to write the screenplay mainly because of their knowledge about Indian culture.Outside of one smaller scene in the middle portion of the movie, the film is relentless in its action and pace. The editing is fantastic in terms of how the movie is stitched together. The beginning starts with an escape from Shanghai gangsters which leads to a plane crash in the Himalayan Mountains followed by an introduction to a devilish Indian cult which leads into fantastic chase sequences and a thrilling, nail-biting rope bridge scene. Yeah, you might want to hold your breath for two hours as the events unfold before your very eyes.It is 1935. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is in China working on a trade with a Chinese gangster and his two sons. The trade is ill-fated from the start and narrowly escaped. He was able to rescue the damsel in distress, performer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw). Along with Indiana's preteen sidekick, Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), they board a plane unknowingly that it belongs to the Chinese gangster. Over India, the pilots are given the order to crash the plane into the Himalayan Mountains. After surviving this ordeal, they end in a village where the leader tells them three stones with magical powers were stolen, along with their children to a strange palace. At this palace, they learn of a terroristic cult led by the powerful Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) which kidnapped the children and forced them to work for them. Meanwhile, the cult captured Indy and his friends to be sacrificed but Indy has other plans!Harrison Ford continues to show why he is perfect casting for Indiana Jones. His action skills, his ability to generate funny one-liners, and just being a great action hero. On the other hand, Kate Capshaw is the reason why the film is my least favorite film in the trilogy. She is utterly annoying as the screeching romantic interest. Where are you, Marion Ravenwood? I did like her film-opening musical number. Ke Huy Quan (although known as Jonathan) gets a pass in my book. Some people found his character annoying, but I found him awesome. I mean, any action hero would want an eleven-year-old being able to drive a car!The film received its share of controversy upon release. Some people attacked the film for being racist towards Indian culture. The main sequence that people talk about is the dinner scene where the audience is treated to some legitimate gross-out gags. In a great display of visual beauty, Indy and his friends are treated to monkey brains and slimy bugs. Some people claimed this was an attack on Hindu culture because they do not eat meat. This scene was meant to be a subtle joke and I actually got what Spielberg/Lucas were going for. People also did give the film trouble for the treatment of the Indian cult in general, which I did find a little troublesome. That said, they were effective as villains because they terrified me.The film is known for its darker overtone and its violence. Are you familiar with the MPAA rating system? Are you wondering how on earth did this film earn a PG rating? Well, the PG-13 was not invented yet. You have this film to thank for that rating. Thanks to the effort of Spielberg, the PG-13 would be introduced a mere two months after this film's release.Overall, I thought Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a fantastic middle piece of the original Indiana Jones trilogy. It does to this trilogy just what Empire Strikes Back did for Star Wars. While I really thought the film was effective, it could have done better with a better written and acted female character. At least, Spielberg married Capshaw after meeting on set, so there's that I suppose. Still, this is a fun adventure in its own right. Another excellent score from John Williams and some great cinematography/lighting from Douglas Slocombe.My Grade: A-",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
141,gab-14712,"A Darker, But Entertaining Indiana Jones Film!",9,3 May 2020,"It has been known that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is my least favorite film from the original trilogy...and only by a very slim margin. Ultimately, the film is a technical triumph, a rousing adventure, and an excellent sequel to 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indiana Jones is at his best when he is fighting Nazis, but I think he does quite well fending off an evil Indian cult. Yes, the sequel (actually, it's a prequel) is plenty darker than the first film, but it all makes for a very interesting watch.When the film received its initial treatment, director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas were going through turbulent times in their lives mainly through divorces. Those dark moments represent the darker tone of the story. The duo originally wanted Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote Raiders, to return but he felt the story was too dark and unpleasant for his taste. They hired Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck to write the screenplay mainly because of their knowledge about Indian culture.Outside of one smaller scene in the middle portion of the movie, the film is relentless in its action and pace. The editing is fantastic in terms of how the movie is stitched together. The beginning starts with an escape from Shanghai gangsters which leads to a plane crash in the Himalayan Mountains followed by an introduction to a devilish Indian cult which leads into fantastic chase sequences and a thrilling, nail-biting rope bridge scene. Yeah, you might want to hold your breath for two hours as the events unfold before your very eyes.It is 1935. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is in China working on a trade with a Chinese gangster and his two sons. The trade is ill-fated from the start and narrowly escaped. He was able to rescue the damsel in distress, performer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw). Along with Indiana's preteen sidekick, Short Round (Ke Huy Quan), they board a plane unknowingly that it belongs to the Chinese gangster. Over India, the pilots are given the order to crash the plane into the Himalayan Mountains. After surviving this ordeal, they end in a village where the leader tells them three stones with magical powers were stolen, along with their children to a strange palace. At this palace, they learn of a terroristic cult led by the powerful Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) which kidnapped the children and forced them to work for them. Meanwhile, the cult captured Indy and his friends to be sacrificed but Indy has other plans!Harrison Ford continues to show why he is perfect casting for Indiana Jones. His action skills, his ability to generate funny one-liners, and just being a great action hero. On the other hand, Kate Capshaw is the reason why the film is my least favorite film in the trilogy.

Some people found his character annoying, but I found him awesome. I mean, any action hero would want an eleven-year-old being able to drive a car!There are some interesting scenes which added to the film's darkness. Some people found them controversial, while others found them memorable. Yeah, you might thinking I'm talking about the ""delicious"" meal that welcomed Indy and his sidekicks. I will say that as visual gags, these scenes worked.The film is known for its darker overtone and its violence. Are you familiar with the MPAA rating system? Are you wondering how on earth did this film earn a PG rating? Well, the PG-13 was not invented yet. You have this film to thank for that rating.

142,fernandoschiavi,"Despite the simplicity of the plot, the second film to show Indiana Jones and her iconic hat unfolds well, but too compact, , fails to capture the spirity of adventure we wait",7,27 June 2020,"Starting a hundred ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", which became the biggest box office in 1981, it wouldn't be long before Universal ordered a sequel, which would obviously be surrounded by expectation. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, as well as master John Williams would return for this second part. Generally, when commenting on the franchise, ""The Temple of Doom"" is usually considered the worst in the character's original trilogy, although it is rarely rated as bad. This labeling is understandable, because, without a doubt, it is the most different of the three films, with a darker footprint and a narrative structure that remains inspired by the pulps of the 30s and 40s, but that adds layers to it James Bond The work. And, perhaps precisely because it is different in the middle of equals, the work manages to surprise and has its merits. Producer and co-writer George Lucas decided to shoot a prequel because he didn't want the Nazis to be the villains again. After three rejected plot proposals, Lucas wrote a film treatment that resembled the film's final story.In 1935, professor, archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has a new mission. He escapes from Shanghai, accompanied by Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and the little Round (Jonathan Ke Quan), but on the escape he is forced to stop in India, where he meets a village that asks him to rescue the stones stolen by a sorcerer who enslaves the women. local children. In the search for these stones, he will encounter several obstacles and will face magical powers from the fanaticism of an obscure cult that sacrifices human beings.After the memorable opening moments that do not allow even a second's breath, Indiana Jones and his two companions are thrown into a sad story in progress, with an extremely impoverished village in India whose children were taken from there, as well as a ""sivalinga ceremonial stone. "". Seeing in Indiana Jones an emissary from Shiva to save them, the village places on the hero's shoulders the responsibility of bringing his children and the stone back, which takes the hero to the Pankot Palace, being greeted royally by Chattar Lal (Roshan Seth) at the most unforgettable banquet of the Seventh Art. Again, the bondian inspiration is present with the sumptuous palace hiding a wicked mystical underworld led by Mola Ram (Amrish Puri), an exaggerated and greater than life shaman who tears the heart out of his human sacrifices with his hand.Steven Spielberg is directing a darker, less realistic and, consequently, less interesting film. Nothing, however, that compromises the film to the point of classifying it as a failure. Far from it. The great sin is that it does not reach the excellent expectation, inevitably created after the wonderful film that preceded it. The script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz has a darker tone that permeates the entire film, which is undoubtedly more loaded with violent moments and harsh themes, notably child slavery, which ends up resulting in a unique film that maintains the frantic adventure of the first film and adds those aspects that are less, say, tasty, but that are very well inserted in the script, flowing satisfactorily. In fact, despite this darker air, the film has the merit of also having a lot of humor, much more than the first film, which makes the work lighter, even dealing with more uncomfortable themes, as in the scene where Willie asks desperate for Indy if he knows how to fly, and he replies, ""No. Do you know?"". Right after that, when they jump off the plane in a boat and manage to land (?!), Falling off a cliff (in one of the absurdly unreal sequences) and apparently manage to save themselves, Indy says that ""it wasn't that bad"", only to fall inside a river. In another very funny excerpt, Willie despairs about the animals in the jungle, while Indy plays cards with Round and comments to the boy that her problem is shouting. The dinner scene in the palace also guarantees a good laugh.
The script is a triumph of concatenation of action sequences interspersed with great comic moments, usually involving Short Round and Willie Scott, whether at the banquet where the monkey brain served in the respective skulls is a unique delicacy, or at the time of ""sexual tension between Scott and Jones, whether in the disgusting sequence of insects. Each comic sequence that, I would say, in general, are more comical than in Hunters, serves as a seam for moments of pure tension and action, as in the discovery of the sacrifice chamber by the three, the control of Indiana by Mola Ram, the incessant beating for the liberation of slaves and, of course, the incomparable sequence of mine carts, to this day inspiration for countless other films. The kid played by Jonathan Ke Quan, in fact, is extremely funny, with great comic timing. Kate Capshaw exaggerates Willie Scott's grimaces and screams, making the character very irritating. On the other hand, it is her predicament that guarantees a good laugh, which reinforces the argument that humor is the highlight of the feature.Fortunately, Harrison Ford's undeniable charisma guarantees the viewer's sympathy. Again very comfortable in the role of the archaeologist, his great sense of humor, his funny reactions and even his grimaces (much more restrained than his partner, but very efficient) guarantee the fun. Even because Indiana Jones remains a different hero, making the wrong decisions that compromise his safety, which is always fun and guarantees authenticity to the hero. Observe, for example, the scene in which he throws a stone at a man who mistreats the slave children, just to get the attention of him and everyone else present, since it would be of no use to take that untimely attitude. In another moment, after escaping from being crushed along with Willie and Round, he returns to take the hat, in an attitude that only Indy would be able to take. This enormous charisma of the hero is what avoids the audience's dislike for the film, even with the dark theme addressed.The script sinks the hero into a world that explores things that are clearly disgusting, like a ritual (a kind of black magic) that sacrifices human beings and the slavery of children. Douglas Slocombe's photography (responsible for the three classic films in the franchise) is a highlight, with the master's perfect understanding of the tone that the script gives to the film. Without working on a necessarily dark color palette, he uses strong shades of red to do this work and give an appearance of hell to the underground ""temple of perdition"". In the sequence of the rope bridge, the shots in generous general plans lend both grandeur and tension in the situations that Indiana gets into, leaving us truly in doubt as to how the hero will escape that.On the other hand, the editing of Michael Kahn (Spielberg's longtime partner and responsible for all Indiana Jones) is one of the points that hinder the final result, leaving at certain moments, a drag rhythm. The point here is that the film, after its action-packed opening and the introduction of the problem in the village of India, takes place almost entirely in the same place, and Indiana Jones is not that, it is exploration, discovering new places, it is adventure. Wrongly, the film devotes more than half an hour of its time just to a macabre ritual, really something not pleasant to follow. The big problem with this is that it is something completely different from what we saw in The Raiders of the Lost Ark; this entire passage has absolutely nothing to do with Indiana Jones.After a long hiatus of about forty-five minutes without any action, Indy must escape from the scene and free the children, used as slaves by the temple that gives the film its name. In addition to being highly macabre, with some very violent scenes, of torture and devil worship, we were very much at the mercy of being interested in the topic or not. Only when the clock strikes almost an hour and a half of production does Indy, right after recovering his belongings and gradually being illuminated by a mining cart, the theme returns to play strong for his appearance. Too bad it's too late there. Too bad Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom aren't all they could be.""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is a continuation that strikes us as not what we expected, but that, for that very reason, becomes an adventurous pearl that leaves nothing owed as much to its predecessor as to its successor. When you look carefully at Steven Spielberg's films, it is easy to point out those that the director has ""willingly"" driven and those that he has touched on autopilot. This is because we have come to recognize Spielberg's visual and narrative potential. Fortunately, ""The Temple of Doom"" is not one of those cases. The director manages to create calculated frameworks and action sequences that amuse by absurdity and inventiveness. So, despite the simplicity of the plot - village, request for help, palace, mines, escape - the second film to show Indiana Jones and her iconic hat unfolds well, but too compact, fails to capture and convey the spirit of adventure that everyone we wait.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
143,Ruskington,Comfortably the worst film in the original trilogy,3,19 April 2020,"It takes less than 5 minutes to realise that this is going to be a disastrous sequel. The opening scene takes all the flaws from the original and shamelessly magnifies them to the point where it fees like you are watching a Raiders of the Lost Ark parody. There follows a childish story with atrocious characters and lazy plot developments.Harrison Ford manages to turn in a respectable performance but Lucas' writing has his character on the ropes from the off. While Raiders is silly but enjoyable, Temple is repetitive, predictable and ultimately quite boring. The film looks great and once again there are some spectacular action scenes, but there is just not much you can do to salvage such a badly written story.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

145,agmoldham,Weakest of the Indiana Jones movies,4,15 January 2004,This is the weakest of the three Indy feature films. When they release the fourth film it will lose this title. The plot this time sees a sacred stone stolen from an Indian village. Indy agrees to find the stone and return it to the rightful owners. The film doesn't have quite the same feel good factor as the first and third installments. The female lead isn't anything like as good either this time out and you get the feeling that maybe she was sleeping with the director to get the part. There's enough action to keep most people entertained for a couple of hours though. I suspect this DVD will be the one that most people play once.,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
146,Vivekmaru45,For Once Spielberg Has Got His Facts All Wrong.,8,18 August 2014,"Spielberg Has Made a Mockery Of The Ancient Civilistion Of India. India was the civilization that invented the wheel and the numeric system we now use in day-to-day life. Their religious system, astronomy and general non-violence to animals are idealistic principals. Hindu's are generally strict vegetarians and only some eat eggs, chicken, fish and goat's meat to supplement their diet. And even those are not strict Hindu's. A Hindu by principle is abstemious and strictly vegetarian.Spielberg shows in the film the royalty of India feasting on beetles and snakes, eating raw monkey brains and drinking soup which has the eyes of some unknown animal.Her he makes a gross mistake - he has confused Hindu's with the Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Malaysians. It is they who eat the foods which are tabooed by the Hindu religion. That aside, the film is superb none the less and very imaginative. In fact I think it was Spielberg's first visit to India. Indian cuisine is one of the best in the world and I am sure he must have sampled some. The film star notable Bollywood actor Amrish Puri who has also starred in Richard Attenborough's epic Gandhi. Seth Roshan is also cast in the film and he also starred in Gandhi. Harrison Ford is at his handsomest. Opposite him is the notable actress Cate Capshaw(Black Rain, Just Cause) and the child actor Jonathan Ke Quan(The Goonies Breathing Fire). The plot of the film deals with sacred stones known as Shiva Ling. A Shiva Ling is stolen from a village and Indiana Jones goes to help the villagers. The film opens with Indiana Jones (or Indy) narrowly escapes the clutches of Lao Che, a crime boss in Shanghai. With his eleven-year old Chinese sidekick, Short Round (or Shorty), and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indiana flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unknown to them, is owned by Lao. The pilots leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas, but the trio narrowly manage to escape on an inflatable boat and ride down the slopes into a raging river. They come to Mayapore, a desolate village in northern India, where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by the Hindu god Shiva and enlist their help to retrieve the sacred Sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace.

Behind it all is a cult leader named Mole Ram.It's up to Indy and his friends to stop them. It's a decent sequel though it's a lot darker in part to the writers of it. The mine chase scene was pretty cool. That and the early night club fight scene at the beginning. By today's standards India's depiction may raise a few eyebrows and Indy's friends may get annoying from time to time though in the case of the latter not much.

Again directed by genius Steven Spielberg with master storyteller George Lucas, this outing is a great adventure that begins in the Far East of 1935 Shanghai China and then goes onto the main adventure in India. While Harrison Ford does another great job as the title character, with a great supporting role by Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round, this time around there's a wimpy heroine - Kate Capshaw as Willie Scott. While she can be funny in her role, and she was funny at certain moments in the film, she is for the most part annoying. Again, it's only a slight weakness in this otherwise great film. And of course, a great score yet again by the master composer John Williams! Oh, look out for the very hilarious bug scene in the cave, the eye-popping palace dinner scene, the great mine car chase finale, and a cameo by Dan Aykroyd!

149,afonsobritofalves,A landmark of the 80's and my childhood!,8,29 September 2018,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was the first sequel ever made by Steven Spielberg (although this film is technically a prequel).Let's face it, making a continuation of the wonderful film Raiders of the Lost Ark seemed practically impossible, because although the film had a lot to do more stories in, it had a practically perfect argument, and it was almost impossible to do something equally good or better, and although this film is not really as good as the first, it is still very good!First of all, it is important to mention that this film was one of the first films in history to create the PG-13 classification, due to its violence that exceeded that of the first film (which was not too little), therefore, this film is not very recommendable. for people under that age, being the only film in the Indiana Jones saga that can really scare young people due to its violence and dark theme.As for the argument, the film starts with a scene quite different from the beginning of the other films, while the other films start with a scene of mystery and suspance, it begins with a relaxed dance scene, followed by a very fun action scene ( and a very hidden reference to Star Wars that almost nobody notices when seeing the film for the first time and a clearer one to James Bond films), where we are introduced to the characters of the film, and one thing that I found quite curious in this film is that none of the characters we know in Raiders of the Lost Ark, with the exception of Indiana Jones of course, do not appear in this film, which is not a good thing, but it is also not a bad thing.The opening scene of this film is simply fantastic, firstly because it is very very long and also because it is full of action and more action, a lot of it is unrealistic, but it doesn't matter when the film amuses us like that. The beginning of this film is really full of adrenaline and fun action scenes, and in my opinion, the characters in this film help a lot in the development of these scenes.After these unrealistic but fabulous action scenes, we arrived at the scene where the adventure begins, deep down that whole beginning was just to get to know the characters. The adventure of this film has a very dark, even macabre plot, as the people of a small village in India need help to recover one of the three stolen sacred stones and to recover all the children from the village that had been kidnapped and think that Indiana Jones and his two companions arrived there to help them sent by the gods, and something that says a lot about the character of Indiana Jones, is that he just decides to help this village because he realizes that these stones are very valuable. This is a story with much less potential than that of the first film, but it is fun, captivating and interesting, not leaving the audience bored or sad for a single moment, moreover, this scene gets to be intriguing, although unrealistic.And this is where the story starts to get sinister, when during the trip to the place where they need to arrive (which is done in a montage that shows several scenes that make us love the characters and at the same time remind us of the first film) , the guide is frightened by a statue that Indiana Jones is going to investigate and ends up discovering that it is a demonic statue for the Hindu religion full of human fingers ... this is really being macabre! Which is followed by a horrible but super cool dinner scene where we are told all about the evil Hindu legends about that palace and that whole situation, where we see our dear characters eating insects, snakes, monkey brains, eye soup and other disgusting things (I know this is not really relevant to the final evaluation of the film, but it is impossible to talk about this film without mentioning this scene), it is also in this scene where we meet those who will end up being the villains of the film.And after one of the best romance scenes I've ever seen (whoever saw the movie knows what I'm talking about), the action begins! Indiana Jones and friends find the entrance to the Temple of Doom, go through some traps that would not look good in any other film. Then discover the great villain of the film in the best possible way, dressed as a demon from the Hindu religion and tearing someone's heart out to offer to the god Kali. And as if that were not violent enough, we still saw children being enslaved, scenes of torture and macabre cults, with voodoo dolls and blood drinks ... yes, this film is not for everyone, it is true that the films of the years 80's and 70's were much more violent (which is a good thing), but this is undoubtedly one of the worst in that sense, which is not a bad thing!The rest of the film consists of the characters correcting everything and saving everything, with great action scenes, full of intensity, such as the singing scene of the bridge and the scene of the mine trains and of course, the scene that appears in all the films of the Indiana Jones saga, the scene in which Indiana Jones fights a man much bigger than himself!To sum it up, the film has a story that despite being the weakest story in the Indiana Jones saga, it is a fantastic and fun film, being a film that despite being violent, it is a film that everyone can enjoy, whether by the action, for the suspanse, or for the short comedy scenes!I also want to mention that this was the last Steven Spielberg film that has free violence, which makes me sad, since that was a milestone in the classic films of Stiven Spielberg, especially in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws. I think Steven Spielberg just started using violence as something serious and more reasonable due to the bad reviews that this film has, but I have to argue with those criticisms, this film only works because of the constant violence that we see in this film, and Spielberg if you are reading this remember that this is one of the best films of the 80's and that you did a great job and this is one of the films that made me fall in love with cinema and made me consider you the best director ever!In more technical parts, the film has a fantastic collection of special effects, but this is not surprising since it is a Steven Spielberg film! The film also has a great soundtrack made by John Williams and I am not just referring to the classic March of the Raiders! The clothes used in the film were realistic and the editing of the film fabulous! As for the actors, Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones was fine as always, although many consider Short Round to be an irritating character, I think he is a really fun character and could come back in a future film, and I think this character just works because of the Actor Ke Huy Quan, although actress Kate Capshaw is a good actress, the character Willie Scott that she plays is not a character that I like and I think this could be better worked.Everything in this film is good, but it cannot be compared with the other members of the original trilogy of the Indiana Jones saga (Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), so I will give an evaluation to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom of 8/10.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
150,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Not as excellent as ROTLR, but still an entertaining follow-up",8,22 September 2012,"Raiders of the Lost Ark was considered by many fans to become a masterpiece example that defines the classic Hollywood style with a great mixture of action, adventure, comedy, and romance and it became such a huge hit that Steven Spielberg decides to create some sequels to it by making this one here known as ""The Temple of Doom"".It starts off with Indy and his sidekicks Short Round, a 12-year old boy and Willie, a nightclub singer at Hong Kong landing in India where the people believe that evil spirits have taken all their children away after a sacred precious stone was stolen and they must journey into a booby-trapped temple known as the ""Temple of Doom"" where an evil cult known as the Thuggee is attempting to rise once more, believing that with the power of all five Sankara stones they can rule the world! Now, it's all up to Indiana to put an end to the Thuggee campaign, rescue the lost children, win the girl and conquer the Temple of Doom.I've heard that lots of people hated this movie for it's racially insensitive portrayal of India, it's much darker tone, it's camp value, and for being much too violent than the first film. Well, sure, Raiders of the Lost Ark was also violent, but the ""ripping out someone's heart"" scene in the temple halfway through the film was just too gruesome to even top the violence the original had. I'll admit that while the story isn't as well-thought out as the original, that doesn't stop the fact that the two sidekicks are the biggest flaw in the entire movie! Now, I don't hate the actor who later played Data in ""The Goonies"", but he's annoying here because he shouts every single damn line at the top of his lungs. Willie, however, is much more annoying than Short Round as she contributed nothing to the story other than screaming and complaining which makes her the least compelling females in the franchise.With those flaws aside, it still has some redeeming qualities. The visuals are amazing, the cinematography is the epitome of excellence, the special effects are solid too, and the pacing is very brisk along with some efficient direction from Steven Spielberg. What stands out the most is the acting with Harrison Ford shining at his best with his role as Indy along with some great villains and it's cartoony, but terrific action sequences. The strongest aspect, however, is the music from John Williams and the comedy in some parts of the film.Overall, I understand the fact that people hated this movie, but despite the issues that I've already stated, this is still an entertaining follow-up to a great film if they can get over it's flaws.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

This is my personal least favourite of the Indiana Jones films. I found much less substance to it, and I found the characters and the idea of the cult to be very silly. It is difficult to take this film seriously. It's still got some action, but it's probably best appreciated by children than the other two films. I say it's a stinker, despite some of the action scenes, and it's best avoided unless you're not an adult. I will say I appreciated it slightly more as a child, but the other two films ('Lost Ark' and 'Last Crusade') are much better films, in my personal opinion.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
153,witster18,has a few issues that could have been ironed out...,6,30 April 2012,"I think this movie had TONS of potential, but there's just a few too many scenes that are closer to the ""King SOlomon's Mines"" remake than they are ""Raider's"".The first scene that has serious issues is the scene where they are sliding across the snow in the inflatable raft. I have no problems with the plausibility of the scene(after all, it's an adventure movie), but the fake backdrop was pretty bad for Spielberg standards. Another scene that could have used a nice splice is the campfire scene early in the film. The entire scene is a definite swing-and-a-miss.just after that, from the 40 to 100 minute mark, this is absolutely excellent. Their arrival and first encounters at Pankot Palace are extremely entertaining.Basically, this entry and ""Crystal Skull"" suffer from some campy visuals that take away from the overall realism. ""Last Crusade"" and ""Raider's"" do not have these ""seriously flawed scenes"", and hold up extremely well because of it.I like the film because the story is a departure from the expected story lines, and the film really has a totally different/perhaps-even-more-fun feel compared to the original, but ""Temple of Doom"" is really nothing more than an unpolished gem that could have been much, MUCH better.For reference, here are my ratings of all four Indy films: Raiders - 10 Temple - 6.5 Last Crusade - 8.5 Crystal Skull - 564/100For the longest time I had this at 7/10(69/100), but a recent re-visit dropped it down a notch.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
154,grahamsj3,OK but that's all,5,3 December 2002,"I have to agree with another commenter who said ""Worst of the Trilogy"". The first and the last films were both much better than this one. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom has the poorest acting (by pretty much everyone) and the poorest story of the three. The film tries to rely on grossing the viewer out (eyeball soup, etc.) instead of keeping us entertained as the first (and third) did. The other two films kept the viewer on the edge of his seat for the entire rollicking film. There is very little rollicking in this film at all. This one should possibly be in the Drama genre rather than Action. Altogether a poor addition to the Indiana Jones saga. I gave it a 5.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
155,mikayakatnt,Far from the original,3,21 August 2020,"I loved the original Indiana Jones, but I found myself disliking this film. Temple of Doom felt more like a badly written parody than a true successor of Raiders of the Lost Ark.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ride the successes of the first film and try to take it a step further. What is left is a watered-down version with one-dimensional characters and problematic stereotypes.Temple of Doom follows a simple rescue-artifact plot that grows to a larger, sinister plot. There are secret tunnels, evil cults, and a mineshaft cart ride. This is a darker version of the original yet the tone feels confused.One tradeoff I felt uncomfortable with is Karen Allen's replacement with Kate Capshaw as Willie Scott. We move from a strong female co-actor to a character who's role is scream-and-be-saved by Jones. I found myself more annoyed by Willie Scott more than enjoying her as a character. She stays one-dimensional throughout the whole film with no real character development.Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) serves as the comic relief. Though Jonathan Ke Quan does a stellar job, I found that the comedy in this film feels a bit forced. The comedy in the previous film was more subtle and natural than the Temple of Doom.And those stereotypes. Chinese characters (except Short Round) were painted in ""yellow"" racism with exaggerated features. The way India was portrayed in this film felt uneducated and stereotypical. Though it's not the fault of the Sri Lankans, I felt this is more of a cinematic sin on Lucas&Spielberg's behalf. They mixed up Indian gods, shows off-color representations of Indian cuisine among other things. TOD politically incorrect and culturally insensitive by today's standards.One redeeming quality of this film is the cultural impact some scenes had in popular media. The mineshaft chase sequence comes to mind. The fact that many people after this copied this sequence in video games and film shows a bit of the creative genius that Lucas&Spielberg had. It's iconic and copied time and time again.Yet, that's not nearly enough to save this film.1.5/5. Missing a ton of things that made the original so great. Felt soulless by comparison.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
156,perfectbond,The least enjoyable of the three,5,16 November 2003,"Like the two other films in the series, Spielberg's gift for narrative film is evident, nicely choreographed action scenes are apparent, and here in his prime Ford remains the quintessential action-hero. Nevertheless, I didn't enjoy this film as much as the other two primarily because the clichéd squeamish female companion and the smart-alecky young Asian sidekick were annoying in the Chewbacca vein (By the way Jar Jar Binks is an absolutely hilarious invention. His Jamaican pigeon English and Stepin Fetchit characterization, while not politically correct, nonetheless elicit many guffaws). Thankfully, The Last Crusade returned the series to greatness.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
157,oneloveall,Better and worse in different ways,7,18 May 2008,"Temple of Doom always catches a bad rep for being too shallow and too dark of an adventure for standard Indy fans. Although compared to the other two I see their point, I always seemed to have very little problem with the way they made this sequel. I find it more fun and lively then the other's despite having less character and story. The pace remains thrilling throughout, and the set-pieces simply continue to outshine their predecessor's with reckless glee.The essence of Indiana's second (but chronologically first) adventure may have been simplified, goofed on, and put through some kind of morbid angle, but the overall experience and pacing yielded an escapist film that even goes further to bring us along for the ride when being viewed for the first time at such a young age.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
158,Prichards12345,One of the darkest adventure movies ever - but also one of the most exhilarating,9,28 November 2015,"Exhilarating is certainly the word for the darkest of the Indiana Jones adventures. It's surely one of the fastest cut movies of its time - particularly in the second half, and there are many many ingenious moments. I will never forget seeing this on the cinema - it was like being at a football match, people were cheering at the screen. Ah for the days of 1984.Temple of Doom kind of does that to you.There are, however, many people out there who don't like this movie. ""Weak plot"" ""Too dark"" ""Annoying sidekicks"" etc. I respect these opinions but I just have to differ. Temple is a great movie; Raiders was basically a riff on Clark Gable/Spencer Tracey adventure movies of the 30s: this one is more like the Tarzan and The Leopard Woman style movies of the early 40s, with Indy battling a sacrificial cult (the cult of Kali, no less) in India.You have to admit it's very different from Raiders, and Lucas and Spielberg deserve credit for not just punching out a cookie cutter sequel. There are many fantastic highlights - the mine car chase, the rock crusher scene, the deadly spiked chamber - wow does this movie thrill and startle! Harrison Ford is terrific again as Jones; personally I don't find Short Round and Willie as irritating as some; it's a matter of taste I suppose.To sum up: lightning-paced and perhaps too dark for some, this is a fantastic adventure movie.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
159,Geeky Randy,A disaster saved by a wonderful setting and a selection of memorable thrills,5,29 June 2010,"The second installment in the Indiana Jones series and prequel to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has as many pros as it does cons. The action sequences are much more explosive and thrilling, but this outing doesn't seem to have a heart (no pun intended). It was thrilling for the sake of being thrilling, with very little relevance to the story. Annoyingly no other reprising characters aside from Ford, who is still the awesome archaeologist, on an adventure to return a sacred precious stone that was stolen from a village that believes evil spirits have taken their children away from them. You can see where this story tries to prevent itself from falling after slipping on a banana peel, right? And its self-awareness of the dreadfully annoying love interest (Capshaw) and sidekick (Ke Quan) doesn't pay off in any way. From the start, the film is doomed (again, no pun intended) during the opening credits playing over a corny Capshaw performing Cole Porter's 1934 classic ""Anything Goes"", its presence in this film unnecessary in every single form. But this film is saved by the beautiful setting of Indian, and a ritual scene about an hour into the film which caused so much controversy that the MPAA created PG-13!** (out of four)",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
160,tomimt,Indiana Jones and the Suicidial worshipers of Kali Ma,8,22 April 2005,"It is surprising, that people grade ""The Temple of Doom"" lower than the first movie ""Raiders of the lost Ark"". It's not like they have huge differences.They both are adventure films, extremely well made, which make you sit on the edge of your seat. Only difference here is, that Indy is in India, trying to locate stolen sacred stones. No Nazis anywhere. Maybe it was people who think, that it's okay to stereotype all Germans as Nazis, who gave ""Temple of Doom"" lower grade. I don't know. But what I know, is that I like the flick. From beginning to the end. It's just non stop flow of action and romance.But anyway, Harrison Ford returns in the role of Indiana Jones, famous archaeologist. This time he has a sidekick, young Chinese boy Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) and pretty, but vain club singer Willi (KateCapshaw). Place of action is India and the main baddie is a Kali cult leader Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) who can literally rip your heart out with his bare hand.Spielberg does good directing as usual and ILM has done great job with special effects. Tough as the film is quite old the special effects scenes are quite visible, but I don't really think it's a bad thing for this type of movie: if anything it brings more sense of old time charm.Music by John Williams is again something forth to mention, his sound track follows the moods of the film perfectly adding tension or breaking it when necessary.I dare to say this is as good, or even a tad better in some places than the ""Raiders"", but then again, I like them all.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
161,bigverybadtom,What Were Spielberg And Lucas Thinking?,1,12 February 2013,"The original ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" was an old-fashioned fast-actioned entertainment show, full of exotic locations, wild (if improbable) stunts, stereotypical (but scary) villains, and clean humor. It took place in the 1930's-1940's and was meant to mimic the pop action entertainment of the era.This prequel (taking place before ""Raiders""), however, is awful. Instead of fun adventure, we're treated to a stupid screaming female companion and an even more obnoxious little boy companion, a silly plot and villains, and worst of all disgusting scenes of eating bugs and steaming monkey's brains. This movie actually made me glad when it ended. Fortunately the franchise was strong enough so that this movie didn't kill it.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
162,gigan-92,"""Aw Shut Up, Willie!""",9,31 January 2011,"Of all the Indy films, this one is the one I cherish the most from child hood.I was surprised to see it was not on the Top 250, so i set out to buy all three of the classic films so I could view them again. This film was just as enjoyable as I remembered, all except one thing: Kate f*ckin Capshaw. She was campy and completely over-the-top her performance was pathetic and a distraction at times. I simply despised her in comparison to Karen Allen. Karen Allen's character was much more respectable and much better off as a lead actress with enjoyable grit yet undeniable sexiness. All Capshaw does is complain about her broken nails and the like, imagine that. Acknowledging that weak point, Capshaw actually pipes down quite a bit once the story really gets serious. Once you push her aside, you can see how great this film really is.Harrison Ford is just plain great as our hero, and plays the role perfectly. Johnathan Ke Quan starts off all right, but by the end of the film you will embrace him as a great character, and as quite the bad-ass. Despite all the great action, cinematography and excellent score, my favorite scene just happens to be where Short Round and Dr. Jones are playing poker, and even though Willie is making an ass of herself in the background, it's such a great character moment for the two. I just love that scene! And Amrish Puri was a great villain, perhaps not as threatening as Nazis obviously, but all the same very entertaining.And everything else with the film simply falls into place. John William's score is just ominous and exhilarating all at once, and really adds to the atmosphere of every scene. And Spielberg definitely knows how to use the camera, making every tension filled moment mouth-dropping. Excellent pacing and a well-crafted story make it a very satisfying work over all. To many, this is easily the darkest of the trilogy, and perhaps it is, but I rather like it that way. Why sugar coat it?Spielberg supposedly feels ashamed of this one because of this as well. Oh, you mean because without little boys' and girls' mother's approval the film wouldn't be as marketable. Regardless, the film was a box office hit at the time, so why all the negative reviews? not only that, but the first film, basically all three of them equally deserve PG-13 ratings, seeing as all three have pretty intense violence. So, with that out in the open I believe this film is my favorite, and all around a good movie experience.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

In spite of some silly and over the top scenes with a chase through the crowded streets of Singapore and an escape from an airplane using a life raft, TOD manages to keep things in check.

165,griffolyon12,Indiana Jones's Greatest Adventure!,10,18 February 2008,"Many Indiana Jones fans often view Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as the worst film out of the Indiana Jones trilogy, but I must say that it has always been my favorite.Temple of Doom begins in Shanghai, China, with our favorite archaeologist already swinging punches. In Shanghai Indy attends a nightclub, here he trades the ruthless gangster, Lao Che, an ancient Chinese artifact for a priceless diamond. Of course one thing leads to another and Indy gets poisoned by Lao Che and gets in a big fight against him and his gang for the poison's antidote. In the end Indy gets the antidote and gets cured, he also gets a new love interest when he sort of kidnaps Willie Scott, Lao Che's girlfriend who was the singer at the nightclub, we also meet Indy's pint sized sidekick Short Round. The three end up boarding a plane intended for Delhi in India, but on the way there the pilots, who work for Lao Che, abandon the plane and dump the fuel. Indy, Willie, and Short Round narrowly escape the plane before it crashes and they end up in a small, rural Indian village. Here the village elder describes to Indy that the town's children have been kidnapped by the evil thuggee cult, and that an ancient town artifact, one of the ancient Sankara Stones, has been stolen. Indy accepts the duty of retrieving the Sankara Stone for the village and rescuing their children from the thuggee cult.The first thing that most immediately note about this film is how much darker it is than any other Indiana Jones adventure, but I feel that the darker atmosphere just makes Indy that much more exciting to watch. The film is once more superbly directed by the great Steven Spielberg, and the script by American Graffiti scribes, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, is flawless; just like Raiders it balances the comedy in perfectly with the action and drama. As well the acting is great, Harrison Ford is back in the hat of Indiana Jones and I simply think he was born to play this role. Also John Williams is back once more and delivers another fine score that sells each scene perfectly. All of the other production values are all top notch, in particular the cinematography and art direction.As I mentioned earlier this is the darkest Indiana Jones adventure produced thus far, and for that reason alone many do not like it, majority of fans seem to flock to the more comedic and light hearted third film, but as I have stated previously, this is my favorite Indy adventure so far. First, even though it is a dark film it still has much comedy, majority of it coming in the hilarious banter between Short Round and Indiana Jones. The action is also probably the most exciting action in any of the Indy films, the mine car chase at the end is truly like a roller coaster ride. One of the things this particular Indiana Jones adventure did for me though, that none of the others really did, was it created actual suspense, when Indy is turned to the dark side by the cult it is truly frightening, as well the scene when the man's heart is ripped out is very terrifying, but yet it is one of the finest scenes of the film, showing how truly heartless and evil the thuggee cult is.All in all it is a truly fun and exciting Indiana Jones adventure, and is my favorite Indy film of them all. It is the darkest Indy film, but is also the most fun. One thing to note though, this film is pretty rough for the younger Indiana Jones fans.Temple of Doom gets a flawless 10 out of 10!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
166,Min111,A prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark,8,3 August 2020,"I liked this movie. I think it's just as good as the other Indiana Jones movies. (Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.) It was the first Indiana Jones movie I seen. I think all three of these movies are great. I'm shocked and saddened with the amount of criticism this movie has received, and I think people are being quite unfair. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was a very good movie. It was very dark - I liked it that way. It means it's different compared to the other movies. I have given it a very good rating. I think it's worth at least eight stars or more. Although ""Indian Jones and the Temple of Doom"" came out after ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"", it's actually a prequel. The events of ""Temple of Doom"" takes place before the events of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". In ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the year is 1936. In ""Temple of Doom"", the year is 1935. So, the events of ""Temple of Doom"" takes place one year before the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I had a problem with that at first. Before I found out about that, I was happy with the order of those movies, respectively. I was happy that the Raiders of the Lost Ark was first; the Temple of Doom was second; and the Last Crusade was third. It should've been like that. I wanted ""Temple of Doom"" to be a sequel to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but it actually isn't. That's cause of the stories in these movies. They're all so different. That's a good thing by the way. So, Temple of Doom comes first; Raiders of the Lost Ark comes second; and the Last Crusade comes third. That's the ""exact"" order of the movies. I didn't mind in the end. I accepted it like any other person. It's no big deal. But I like to think they came in the order they were released. It's better that way. It doesn't matter though. Indiana Jones, an archaeologist, is in a country called India where he has to find an ancient stone that has been stolen from a Indian village by someone. He is asked by the Indian villagers to help them. Can Indiana Jones find the missing stone? Can Indiana Jones save the day? You need to see it to find out. Let's not forget some of the other characters such as Willie Scott, who is a romantic interest for Indiana Jones, and Short Round. I know, his name is strange, but he was very funny. I liked Short Round in the movie. He was probably my favourite character of the lot. The movie would've been a lot different had he not been around to save the day. He's the Chinese sidekick by the way. One of the coolest characters around. Let's not also forget the bad guy or villain named Mola Ram. He was pure evil. He was very scary. The movie was so interesting to watch all due to him. Actually, when I was a child, I was very afraid of him. I had nightmares. I think the great thing about 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' is the story which I think is perfect. The story makes it so interesting and entertaining to watch. I could watch this again if I had the time. You should give 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' a chance. It's a good movie. It's one of the greatest adventure movies from the eighties. I happen to like adventure movies by the way.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
167,TalesfromTheCryptfan,Easily the worst of the series but still very good!,8,10 June 2008,"A year before the events ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is in Shanghai enjoying an evening of entertainment and making a deal on trying to get a Chinese artifact from a Chinese mob.

They get stranded in the jungles of India, where the villager's children have been taken by a cult of thug-gees and stolen some precious stones that are sacred to them. Indy and his two companions go to the palace of a young prince where they discover that the Thugee cult live underground of the palace including a witch doctor named Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) who has the village's children and the stones as Indy must try to get them back.Considered the black sheep of the Indiana Jones Trilogy, this entertaining and quite dark installment is quite underrated. Steven Spielburg directs again and George Lucas made the story and produced this, fans have often scorn this installment because of the annoying Kate Chapshaw and some of the out of place humor including Short Round. Yes i know Willie was a pain in the butt but Short Round did provided some good laughs, i like how they use some darkness like the bug area which would creep out even the people that are spooked of insects. There is a lot of action and tension that will keep the viewer on the edge of their seat and there's also some dark stuff like the infamous heart ripping sequence which disgusted parents when it came out and caused the MPAA to create the ""PG-13"" rating that year.Despite some of the flaws of this movie, there's some good memorable action sequences like the mine cart ride sequence and the climax which are smashing.

169,dr_foreman,"""Doom"" is about right.",3,28 December 2006,"This is a shockingly bad movie. I can't for the life of me understand why it has earned over a 7.0 rating on IMDb and a club of supporters on the Internet. Nostalgia, perhaps? I enjoy ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" even though I find it to be a little politically incorrect and overrated. ""The Temple of Doom,"" on the other hand, is downright atrocious, mightily racist and even a tad sexist. Apparently the movie was banned in India, and I can understand why, since it depicts Indians as miserably poor, superstitious, knife-waving, monkey-brain-eating lunatics.The really sad part is that the movie stinks even if you manage to ignore the racism. It's chock full of disgusting moments, like the beetle-eating scene and the part where about a hundred bugs crawl all over Kate Capshaw. It simply pushes the gross envelope too far.Even the never-ending action scenes are lacking. They're okay, I guess, but there's quite a lot of unconvincing blue screen work, and the big flood segment doesn't work because water doesn't ""miniaturize"" well. As if the special effects weren't bad enough in themselves, they're complimented by an obnoxious soundtrack, including some unusually bombastic John Williams music and Capshaw's relentless screaming.You know, she really is a terrible heroine - annoying and painfully unfunny. A beautiful woman, sure, but irksome as all get-out. It's very surprising (in a bad way) to see such a lame female character in Indiana Jones after the series started off with Karen Allen's excellent performance as the (relatively) tough Marion Ravenwood.Capshaw would be quite bad enough by herself, but compounding the casting problem there's Ke Huy Quan as Short Round, Indy's pointless kid sidekick. Whenever there's a stupid bit of slapstick comedy in the movie, Short Round helpfully cries, ""Very funny! Very funny!"" Which is code for painfully unfunny, of course.Weirdly enough, Capshaw (whose character is called Willie, for goodness' sake!) and Short Round are really the only characters - the villains are completely faceless. There's a very bizarre segment when Indy puts on his scholarly glasses and has dinner with some people who I guess might qualify as characters, but the scene just doesn't fit with the rest of the movie, and never for a moment does the dialogue feel ""real."" So, in the absence of strong characters, the movie just sort of drunkenly reels from fight to fight.I have one last observation. At one moment, Indy is waiting in his bedroom, expecting Capshaw to come in and have sex with him (he's too proud to go to her bedroom). The strange part about this set-up is that Short Round is in Indy's bedroom. Soooo...I guess Indy is expecting to have sex in front of Short Round? Isn't that a little strange? Well, maybe not; I guess the kid has to learn sometime. But maybe Indy should just go to her room, huh? Sloppy scenes like that are a sure indication that Spielburg, Lucas and co. were really having an off day when they made this. Terrible, terrible, terrible.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

175,nickenchuggets,"""Fortune and glory""",8,18 August 2021,"While the first Indiana Jones movie earned a lot of praise from pretty much everyone, the follow up is seen as something of a mixed bag. When it was first released, it drew criticism for its surprising amount of violence compared with its predecessor, as well as having too many action oriented scenes. It's almost like Spielberg was afraid people were going to get bored and walk out of the theater. In my view, this movie actually manages to be more slow-moving than the first because there's no nazis in it. They were the ultimate villains of Raiders of the Lost Ark, and having them be the antagonists of the story felt more urgent, especially since world war 2 was almost about to start. In this film, Indy doesn't set foot in a single european country for the entire runtime, which may have disappointed some people (including me). Still, Temple of Doom changes things up substantially by introducing a brand new setting in the form of British colonial India, and also features new characters, some good and some not so much. The movie starts in mid 1930s China which by this point is under attack by the japanese, who have seized the northern reaches of the country (Manchuria) and renamed it Manchukuo. Indy is sitting at a table in a nightclub conversing with a crime boss from Shanghai, while singer Willie Scott performs the Cole Porter song Anything Goes. While trying to negotiate a deal with Lao (the mob boss), Indy drinks a cup of poisoned liquid and the club is thrown into disarray as he attacks Lao and searches for an antidote. After escaping, a young kid named Short Round drives Indy and Willie to a cargo plane waiting on an airstrip. Little does Indiana Jones know, the pilots of the plane are thugs hired by Lao. After Indy and his friends fall asleep, the pilots dump the plane's fuel over the Himalayas and then bail out. Indy wakes up just in time, and he, Willie and Short Round jump out of the plane holding onto a rubber raft since the pilots threw away all the parachutes. After riding the raft on a river for some time, they arrive at a village in British India. Indy learns that the people there are desperate to retrieve these special kinds of stones for a religious monument, along with some missing children. After riding on elephants to the nearby Pankot Palace, Indy and his friends are allowed to stay the night as guests, but he is later attacked in his bedroom and nearly garroted to death with piano wire. After overcoming his adversary, Indy finds a hidden passageway in his bedroom that leads into a dark and cramped network of tunnels filled with all kinds of bugs and traps. After pressing deeper into the tunnels, the three adventurers find a huge number of cultists sitting in rows and facing a stone monument. This is the lair of the so called Thuggee cult, who are the people responsible for stealing the Sankara stones the villagers need. They've also enslaved the missing children to dig in caves in order to search for more stones. After trying to set things right without being detected, Indy, Willie and Short Round are all captured, and Indy is forced to drink a potion that puts him in a sort of trance to carry out a ritual. Willie is placed in a metal cage with chains attached to it that lowers into a pit of fire and lava while Mola Ram (the Thuggee leader) watches. Indy has no choice but to assist the cultists as Willie is strapped into the sacrificial cage, but Short Round appears and burns him with a torch, returning him to reality. After fighting off the Thuggees, they make their way to the mines (where Indy fights a Thuggee slave driver) and later escape on a minecart. After finally escaping the underground, Indiana Jones is trapped on a fragile bridge hanging high above a crocodile infested body of water. Mola Ram and his cultists are on one side, and more cultists close in from the other side. Indy decides it's all or nothing and slices the bridge's cable with a sword, making all but a few of the cultists fall into the water. As Mola Ram hangs onto a piece of the bridge with Indy, the latter tells him he has betrayed the Hindu god Shiva, causing the stones to burn so hot they make Ram let go of the bridge and fall to his death. Shorty after, some Indian troops show up and gun down the remaining Thuggees, and the adventurers return to the village to restore the stones to their rightful place. While I thought Temple of Doom was good, it felt a little lacking compared with the first movie in the series. There's a little too many loud action scenes for my liking, and Willie and Short Round are both (admittedly) pretty obnoxious characters. Willie just acts as the typical girl who needs to be saved by the main hero of the movie, and constantly begs Indy for assistance. Short Round on the other hand just sounds like Elmo. I don't care for it. The action sequences are entertaining, but they don't make much sense from a logical point of view. For example, the part that involves Indy and his crew riding the mine cart through the tunnels shows several railroad tracks that are floating over rivers of lava. How did they manage to build those? Harrison Ford reprises his part from the previous movie, so if you've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, you should know the deal. Indy is still an expert with his whip and can find his way out of almost any situation. There's also the excellent and tension-filled music by John Williams, who honestly deserves as much money as Spielberg by this point. To summarize, Temple of Doom may not have the european settings from the first movie to give it an authentic prewar feel, but it definitely contains enough clashes, special effects, supernatural entities, and deranged cultists to satisfy fans of adventure movies.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Steven Spielberg)After landing in India with his sidekick Short Round (Ke Quan) and a kidnapped American singer, Willie Scott (Capshaw), Indiana Jones (Ford) is sent by a village to recover a mysterious stone. Whilst searching for it, he stumbles across the stones in use by a cult, headed by Mola Ram (Puri). Behind this cult, he discovers another hideous truth; the village's children being order to constantly work.Whilst it suffers from the dark direction it has taken, Temple of Doom is still highly enjoyable and a worthy inclusion in the Indy series.

179,jhaggardjr,"Prequel to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""",9,24 March 2002,"It's funny to call ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" a followup to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". This film is a prequel to the 1981 smash hit, a movie where the events that take place actually took place before the events in ""Raiders"". Notice at the beginning of ""Raiders"" that the year is 1936. In ""Temple of Doom"", the year is 1935. See what I mean? ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is another rollercoaster ride of a movie brought to life by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Harrison Ford is back as archaeologist Indiana Jones who this time searches for a sacred stone that was stolen from an Indian village. Along for the ride is American singer/entertainer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw, aka Mrs. Steven Spielberg) and little Chinese sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan). On their way to finding the stone they stumble across a palace that leads to the gateway of the Temple of Doom run by an evil Thugee cult. The action and special effects are first-rate as you would expect, though the story is a tad weaker than it was in ""Raiders"". Plus, Capshaw's performance leaves something to be desired. She goes so far over-the-top in some scenes that you'd wish Karen Allen would show up as Marion. Nevertheless, Capshaw isn't all that bad. She does make an impression during the times when she's not screaming. But Ke Huy Quan (now known as Jonathan Ke Quan) comes off better as Indy's young sidekick. The following year he starred in the Spielberg produced Richard Donner directed ""The Goonies"", but then didn't appear in much after that. ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is great fun only if you can get by Kate Capshaw's simpering wimpering character or the over-the-top violence. I found it to be exciting from beginning to end.***1/2 (out of four)POINT OF INTEREST: this was the film that lead to the creation of the PG-13 rating in 1984 (along with Spielberg's other 1984 movie ""Gremlins""). Both ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and ""Gremlins"" feature violence that most people felt was too strong for a PG rating, though the MPAA felt that it wasn't strong enough to merit an R rating (other Spielberg movies that got PG ratings that were quite intense were ""Jaws"", ""Poltergeist"", and the original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""). So after ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and ""Gremlins"" opened in theaters at the beginning of the summer movie season of 1984 and became two of that year's biggest hits, the MPAA realized a new rating had to be created. The PG-13 rating was born. In August 1984, the first movies were released with the new PG-13 rating (""Red Dawn"" and ""The Woman in Red""). It's not a new rating anymore. The PG-13 rating has held up very well these last 18 years and it'll still go strong in the years to come. But I'll always remember ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" as the leading factor to the creation of the PG-13 rating.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

181,Al_The_Strange,"""Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory.""",9,3 October 2012,"After ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" Spielberg, Lucas, and the gang had a hard act to follow. They generally delivered with this prequel, taking Indy through a thrilling roller-coaster ride (or a mine-card ride as the case may be) of an adventure. There are still lots of great fights, great chases, and even more memorable setpieces and sequences, and even more comedy. Yep, this film is still a blast! The story never really felt that strong to me, especially when compared to its predecessor and successor. It does have merits though; this is a figurative journey to Hell, and it gets pretty darn dark and wicked at times. The whole heart-ripping scene is what gave birth to the PG-13 rating in the first place. My only complaint about all this is that it contrasts way too much with the silly comedy scattered throughout, breaking up any sense of foreboding.Otherwise, the story is serviceable, at the least. It has tight pacing and a consistent flow (even if the transition from the opening scenes to the main story is a little screwy). Some of the action scenes get pretty absurd and unrealistic, but I find most of these faults forgivable. In the end, it's still a fun story that's well-told and with a group of likable characters.The film has fine photography, with plenty of good camera angles and quality lighting. Acting is great; Harrison Ford is still the man, Kate Capshaw (aside from being a bit annoying) plays her part perfectly, Jonathan Ke Quan is lovable as Short Round, Amrish Puri is perfect as the villain (probably the best villain in the series). Writing is great, production value is great, and the music is great.Given the bizarre mix of comedy and dark subject matter, I'd probably recommend this one more as a rental.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
182,PedroPires90,Have to admit it: it's my favourite!,10,12 December 2020,"I love Raiders, it's a 5 star movie. I love Last Crusade and Connery was a great addition to it. However, I need to say something I never had the balls to admit it louder: Temple of Doom is my favourite. It has everything I love about the other Indy movies plus it's much darker and much more frenetic. I get that it can be too much for a family movie, but this is for me the perfect Indy movie.Spielberg knew exactly what he was doing with every single shot and sequence, managing the camera like no other can do when we are talking about action/adventures scenes. The dialogue is perfect, sometimes cheesy, but that's exactly what we want from an Indiana Jones movie. The editing is outstanding - the jungle scene with the animals and the rooms scene in the palace deserved an Oscar just for that - and John Williams is always perfect, with one of the best scores of his career, showing that there is no other even close to him.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
183,bsinc,Not nearly as good as Raiders of the lost ark,6,8 March 2002,"Where do I begin. I just saw this movie again a half an hour ago and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. I saw ""Raiders"" the previous week and remembered what a good movie it is (9/10), but my childhood memories of the Indianan Jones series were all from this one. Maybe this shows that this movie is probably best digestible for the kids. But don't get me wrong!The opening scene in the restaurant is very entertaining untill Jones jumps into a car driven by a 10 year old boy. From then on the movie takes an enormous step backwards portraying unnecessary stupidness and comic relief that only an eight year old will find satisfactory. ""Raiders"" was a gem compared to this superficial excuse of an adventure movie. There are so many stupid mistakes and unbelievable action parts that you can't help but think that you're probably watching one of the most disappointing Spielberg movies ever. Indiana grows a beard over night (during the flight) and the woman calls him ""Indie"" (how does she even know his friends call him that)the second day as if they had known each other since eternity. But don't get me started on the female part of this movie just yet, I'll come back to her later.Anyway, after an amazing and extremely believable (NOT!!) rescue from the plane the plot part of the movie starts to formulate. Ooooops, did I say plot, believe me when I say that you have a better chance of finding a plot in a Levis jeans commercial. But let's put that aside for the moment and concentrate on the rest of the movie. The boy, serving as a comic relief succeeds in some parts but is annoying in more. Ford is good as usual, doing many parts of his acting merely with his eyes. And they can be really powerful. But the woman, oh Lord, the woman is the icing on a cake to this fiasco of shere unintelligent entertainment. Because that is what this movie really is. You have to completely switch off the part of your brain that directs reason. Well, they reach a castle surrounded by enormous blood-sucking vampires that are nervously flying across the screen for the next few minutes. And the movie reaches its high point of stupidness with the infamous ""feast"" at the dinner table. After that the romantic part of the movie comes to life, and boy is it believable. Yeah, and Kate Capshaw got the part because of her talent. There was some talent involved, but it as hell wasn't acting. She's almost as bad in this movie as Sharon Stone was in ""King Solomone's Mines"", which by the way was the B-rate movie answer to the Indiana Jones movie, shamelessly copying them in every aspect and not even bothering to hide it. Her character is so annoying and isn't funny at all. When she poured perfume on the elephant's head I wished I could meet the writer of this movie and get Clockwork Orange on his ass.But after the romance comes one of the scarriest scenes in movie history (to me that is since I can't stand bugs). There are some huge and horrible bugs crawling onto the characters making me shiver even as I am writing this review. Now that's what I call horror. And that's where the movie suddenly becomes enjoyable and the nostalgic sense of it's predecessor comes to life. Apart from the scene where Mola Ram rips the guy's heart out of his chest which then magically heals, the movie goes from terrible to very entertaining. Highly action packed scenes take you for a ride of a life, like the one on the bridge. Pure genius, to cut the ropes. The effects, both in the tunnel and on the bridge are exceptionally well done for that time and if Spielberg played his cards right in the first half I'd be praising this movie right now. But just to let you know that the good part of the movie was there purely by chance the film makers decided to end the movie with a lesson learned for Indie:""Yes, now I see the power of the stone"".     Now that's deep.Ha. This is a movie that could have easily been better that the first one, but lacks everything to do so. There's not even a new theme, or even the dark one from the first movie. To enjoy it you have to be either a kid or completely ignore the connection with ""Raiders"".     6/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
184,lagudafuad,The darks side of the indiana jones series,8,9 November 2012,"I have seen the Temple of Doom more than I can count; I just never tire of seeing Dr. Jones trying to stop the Kali priest (Mola Ram) from ripping out his heart.The movie has wonderful visual effects from the heart removal scene where Mola Ram removes the heart of the human sacrifice and we behold the beating heart in his hand while the individual is still alive, then the heart catches fire as the sacrifice is lowed into a fiery death hole. That scene is a huge high for me.The Kali-Ma slave blood ritual, where Jones is forced to ingest blood so as to be a Kali-Ma slave, I believe that was the low for me in this flick, from his zombie behavior back to his normality seemed to wishy-washy for me.Although its initial release faced heavy criticism for the intense violence, child slavery, black magic, and the ritual human sacrifice depicted in the movie, but as time went by it has become a critical acclaim, holding an 85% approval rating in Rotten Tomatoes.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was done in 1984 and it is the second film in the Indiana Jones franchise. Although it was done 3 years after Raiders of the Lost Ark the timing of the events were set to be a year before Raiders of the Lost Ark, making Temple of Doom a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark as temple of doom was set in 1935 while Raiders of the Lost Ark was set in 1936 and The Last Crusade was set in 1938.The movie plot has our protagonist Jones team up with Short Round (a Chinese, eleven year old sidekick) and also at Indy's side is a night club singer named Wilhelmina ""Willie"" Scott. Together the 3 of them find themselves being persuaded to go save a village from destruction and help recover their Sankara stones, which was the source of the village's good fortune.The children of the village have all been taken and used for labor for the cause of Mola Ram (a demonic Thuggee priest) who uses the kids to search for the remaining Sankara stones so as to bring the rise of Kali who will then rule the world.The movie was a financial success but many attributed the movie's dark side to be as a result of the breakups that both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were facing at that time.The movie too has faced criticism in India for its inappropriate portrayal of the goddess Kali who in this movie is portrayed as evil. Also the food being served when Indy, Short Round and Willie were at the palace was seen as culturally inappropriate (baby snakes, eyeball soup, beetles and chilled monkey brains) are not cuisines in the Indian diets.It won Best Visual Effect in the Academy Awards.All I can say is that this is a movie I have come to love and accept as a classic and a most see in the Jones series.www.lagsreviews.com",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
185,willcundallreview,Indy's back in what I consider good form in a good film,7,9 August 2015,"Temple of Doom, an Indiana Jones widely criticised for being too dark and just not as good as the others, but for me this is a worthy entry. Not only is Indy on good form, Spielberg is also on great form and together it creates a movie that is entertaining and enjoyable. The film also may not have as much adventure as say Raiders or Last Crusade but in any case it is good fun and an addition I don't mind.Harrison Ford continues to be in good shape for the films, he doesn't do any worse than he did in Raiders, maybe there is a little less action from him but in any case his humour and adventurous spirit is acted out well. Kate Capshaw as Willie is well, quite a bit annoying, I mean the acting isn't bad(but not great really) it is just the constant screaming and moaning can really get on your nerves. The addition of the young man that is Short Round(Jonathan Ke Quan) is a good one, some may argue he is a little annoying which he can be but he creates a certain lighter tone among the more dark things going on.No matter what Spielberg may think of this movie, I for one found it to be well done by him and one that should be a movie to be proud of. Without Lawrence Kasdan you may think the script would be poor and not a good example of writing in Indiana Jones movies, but for me Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz create something that is fine, not perfect by any means but it at least forms a nice basis for the entire picture.Don't get me wrong here, Temple of Doom can have its fairly dull moments and points maybe of negativity. The pacing of the film is just a little off, sometimes you can have all out action then none at all and even the thrills disappear then reappear out of nowhere, this is truly a film that moves fast and slow in its story. Of course with just under two hours of a movie you can't just sit around all of the time but I admit I found the middle parts to be slightly duller than say the beginning and end but all in all it is a solidly put together piece.One thing I found this movie is underrated for is actually the darkness it holds, sure people then and some people even now find it a little too dark but in truth I feel that is what makes it different. Of course the film is not realistic(I mean come on) but what it does do is bring a more realistic kind of tone to if what was going on were real, this is how it would be done, with blood and all. I personally didn't find it too dark, I admit like others also think that the treatment of Indian culture and faith is not exactly spot on here although I never found it to be overly horrible, just maybe don't claim Indians eat monkey heads and snakes for their dinner. Overall I enjoyed this and I would come back to it no doubt, as mentioned maybe not as good as say Raiders or Last Crusade but in any case it is an adventure and a half anyway. I think if you consider yourself a fan of adventure and for some reason you haven't seen this movie yet, then I would say go find it and see it, it's the kind of fun we are used to from Indiana Jones and added in is some new characters and new villains too. Funny, thrilling and all together a very watchable movie, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a movie that should be watched and shouldn't be hated as much as some do, plain and simply this movie for me personally, is well worth seeing.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Of course, aspects haven't aged so well: the somewhat racist/colonial tone towards the locals, the character of Willie Scott who exists only to scream, get rescued and be lusted over - and the rather more personal issue that she has the same name as the father of a school friend of mine.

189,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,10,7 February 2005,"My favourite of the series, easily the darkest, and possibly the funniest and most exciting. Jones travels to India after a dramatic escape from the bad guys, and along with his young friend Short-Round, and dancer Willie Scott they find themselves embroiled in a terrifying adventure. A local village appears to have been cursed when its mystical stones were stolen. The children of the village have also been taken. The village priest believes Jones is a God sent to bring back the kids, stones, and joy, and Jones is soon travelling to a nearby Temple to investigate. He soon uncovers a plot to resurrect an evil God, although the real problem is that Mola Ram, the bad guy is using the children as slaves, killing many and drugging others with what is known as 'the black sleep of Kali Ma'. Indy tries to bring down Mola Ram and save the kids while recovering the stones, but of course this will not be easy, especially after Indy is captured. The film is widely seen as the weakest of the series, perhaps because of the gore, but probably because of the racial undertones. It must be remembered though that the film was set in Colonial Times (or at least when India was still seen as a British Colony), and this sort of thing runs through the series, as well as hundreds of other films. Indy can be seen as the white western man coming to save the helpless East from a tyrannical ruler, with his supposedly superior knowledge and technology proving to be more powerful and useful against their primitive and barbaric ways. However, Lucas and Spielberg are not stupid, they would have been fully aware of these themes, and to an extent they are turned on their heads. Indy succumbs to their powers, and it is Short-Round his young Chinese friend who rescues him. Willie Scott is seen as hollow, materialistic and unable to cope without her Western luxuries. Indy almost experiences a 'King Solomon's Mines' like return to primitive ways, but admittedly is brought back. The film has many exciting set-pieces- the opening chase for diamond and antidote, the cave closing scene, the escape from the plane, the mine-cart chase, and the rope bridge finale are a few. The script again is good with many jokes, and Ford's usual charm is here for all to see. Capshaw spends most of her time screaming, which is what the role demanded, and Indy's side-kick is the best character in the series after Indy himself. He is capable of fighting those bigger than him, often imitating Indy, and is wise beyond his years. Mola Ram is pure evil. There are several scenes which may be scary for young kids- the sacrifices particularly, and there is a fair amount of blood. However, it is enjoyable for all ages, and i continue to find new things now that i didn't see when i was younger. 10 out of 10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

It all depends on the person. Me personally, I would say it's probably the weakest of all four, but there is some part of me that really enjoys it.What's the biggest problem with the movie, well I think you can guess. Willie and short round can be unbearably annoying. There are quite a bit of plot holes. It's offensive to the Hindu religion, and there are quite a few boring parts. And some of the special effects haven't stood the test of time.All those are basically problems I mentioned in the first half of the movie. The first half is basically mostly comedy and a poor romance. Yet the second half is a lot of fun with tons of action. And this may make me sound sadistic, but I actually kind of like how dark it gets. Sometimes it would get a little too depressing, but for the most part it just made the villain more evil.

Sole bad point is the appearance of Kate Capshaw, you just wish Karen Allen (who was Indy's girl in Raiders Of The Lost Ark) as I cant imagine there will be one adventurer who might be pleased with a woman that only yells, but for the rest one of the best movies I will ever seen in my life!!!!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
195,bh_tafe3,"Solid outing, though more of its time than its predecessor",8,26 February 2015,"People getting their hearts ripped out, weird Indians eating monkey brains and live snakes, caves full of insects, riding elephants through the jungle aaaaaand a music number! It's fair to say this second film in the Indiana Jones franchise (chronologically the first) has everything you would expect from an 80s adventure film. It took the franchise in a new direction and tried to show us how Indy went from being a cynical, somewhat greedy archaeologist to the more principled and less jaded character we know from the first film.Temple of Doom opens with a music number in Shanghai as Indy attempts to finalise a business negotiation with an Asian gangster named Che Lao. In a portent of things to come, the music number is Anything Goes, which is certainly true of this film, though in the most fun way possible. Lao betrays Indy by poisoning him, and Indy is forced to run around looking for antidote, shoot his way out with help from his young friend Shorty and taking the nightclub singer Willie hostage. The three escape a plane crash in an inflatable dinghy and end up in an Indian village, where they learn the village is suffering a curse and their children have been stolen along with some magic stones. Indy has a theory, that the children have been kidnapped by the Thuggee cult, who are thought to be dormant and so sets off to find the Prime Minister of Pankot.For the next twenty minutes, you'd be excused for thinking you are watching a sequel to Romancing the Stone as our intrepid heroes trek through the jungle, having encounters with snakes, elephants and various other jungle animals. They eventually get to the castle, Indy is told his Thuggee theory is daft by both the Prime Minister and child Maharajah. In the meantime Willie is stuck in a scene from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, sitting around a macabre table with people eating chilled monkey brains fresh from the skull, snake surprise (they're alive!) and eyeball soup.After some assassins try to kill Indy, we actually find ourselves in an Indiana Jones movie for a little while as Indy and Shorty stumble upon a hidden chamber and try to find their way through. They get stuck and Willie has to come and save them (he shouts ""We are going to Die!!"" giving the distributors a sound grab that was used in every trailer) and then they end up in the Temple.Once the film gets to the Temple, that's where we stay till right near the end. The Temple is kind of like a more colorful version of the chamber from the 1930s Boris Karloff film The Mummy, but kind of reminds of the sacrifice scene in King Kong as well. The final showdown happens on a rope bridge and is reminiscent of the ending to ""The Man Who Would Be King"" (another great adventure movie that is well worth checking out).In this we kind of see Indy change from a fairly greedy man chasing fortune and glory and not believing in mysticism to a character closer to the one we see in Raiders. Harrison Ford gives another excellent and committed performance. Of the other cast Amrish Puri, as Mola Ram, the leader of the evil cult, is a great villain, though a little hammy, the ham is appropriate. Kate Capshaw who played Willie went on to marry the director. She is OK, but many fans didn't like her screaming damsel character. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round is OK, but like Willie, only appears to be there to meet what was seen as a requirement at that time. A child side kick.So Temple of Doom is a really good example of 80s adventure film making, just check out this and Young Sherlock Holmes, Or Romancing the Stone/ Jewel of the Nile or the Goonies. You can tell they are the same vintage. However, Ford is so good in this and the action scenes are done so well, and a lot of care is taken with effects. For a kid growing up in the 80s, this movie was ""where it's at,"" to a greater degree than any of the other Indy films. Looking back now it's considerably more dated than Raiders or Last Crusade, but it's still a lot of fun. A wonderful example of a prime vintage, overflowing with nostalgia. While Raiders harked back to Saturday matinée fun, this one encapsulated what it took to be an action adventure film in the 1980s. And it works a treat. Another classic.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
196,RiffRaffMcKinley,"118 Minutes of Underrated, Death-Defying Fun!",8,2 September 2007,"I can understand why some people don't like ""Temple of Doom."" While the plot is excellent, it's very, very different from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" It's darker. It's gorier. It's scarier. And it has that obnoxious kid, as well as Kate Capshaw. (She is terrible!) But if you're just willing to give it a chance, it doesn't disappoint nearly that much. Set mostly in the Indian Himalayas, ""TOD"" centers on Indy's quest to recover sacred stones for an impoverished village from a sinister High Priest (Amrish Puri) and his fanatical cult, the Thuggees. But the Thuggees have also captured another treasure from the little village: the children! Only Indiana Jones can get them back, with the help of a prissy, whiny, spoiled nightclub singer (Capshaw) and the aforementioned obnoxious kid, Indy's Shanghai-born sidekick Short Round (who does, admittedly, have some great moments). It's another great ""Indy"" movie, and the thrills (The bug room! The spike chamber! The heart-stopping mine car chase!) top even those from ""Raiders.""

It is 1935 Shanghai, China and Indy has arrived at club Obi-Wan to meet with Lao-Che( Roy Chiao). He is to give Che the remains of the last emperor of China for a Diamond. While there he meets Willie Scott( Kate Capshaw). She is a singer/dancer at the club and Lao-Che's girl. While Indy is there Lao and Indy do business, but it goes south, and Che tells Indy to keep Willie. The two escape with the help of Short Round( Ke Huy Quan). Short Round is an ex-pick pocket who Indy caught one day. The two have been a team and the are inseparable. The three believe they have escaped Shanghai when they board a cargo plane. The plane though is owned by Lao-Che Air. When the three are up in the air they believe they have made it, so they take a nap. When they wake they realize the crew escaped when they were sleeping and no one know how to land a plane. They see that the plane is headed for a mountain range, and need to escape. They find the only thing on board, a raft and escape out of the plane later landing in the waters of India.While there Indy drags along Willie. and she is so annoying all she does is scream & complain. I don't even know purpose of her character; unless they needed an Indy girl. They should have gotten someone ballsy like Mariam. While they are there they are taken to a village in India. There they are greeted given food, and are meet by the Shaman( D.R. Nanayakkara)who tells him what happened to the village. The Molla Ram( Amrish Puri) with the help of the Thuggee cult stole The Shankara stone and there children. The children were taken to work deep in the mines to find the remaining stones.The stone 1 of 5 bring life and hope to the village. The Shaman tells Indy he will provide a guide to Bangkok; but first they are to stop at Pangkok Place. That night Indy discovers that a child escaped from the palace, before he dies the kid gives him a piece of cloth a map with Sheba.When the three reach the palace, Indy is on guard nobody is to be trusted. That night they have a nauseating dinner. It consisted of snake surprise, bugs, chilled monkey brains, and eye ball soup-YUM. Afterwards Indy starts to get closer to Willie. After going through booby traps, bugs and witnessing a Thuggee ceremony they wonder whats next. A ceremony that hasn't been witnessed in over a 100 yrs. As soon as the ceremony is over it clears out and it's quiet-too quiet. This is went the three are caught by a Thuggee henchman. Willie is the next victim, Indy is forced to drink the blood of Kali, which makes him evil, and Short Round is a prisoner forced to work. When Short Round escapes he helps Indy snap out of his trance. When the three are united again they have to escape the mine, through the mine shaft. They are successful, but come face to face with Molla Ram. Indy is able to defeat the Molla Ram, save one of the stones, and freeing all the children; and capturing the rest of the henchmen and thugge cult members. The three make the trek back to the village with the one Shankara stone.
This is a good Indy film, involving comedy, suspense, bugs and a dinner that would make Ur skin crawl. The only negative was Willie, still it is a must see High Recommended.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
198,tankace,Underrated sequel.,9,13 July 2016,"Temple of Doom was criticized by critics at the time for racism and lacking the magic of the first ,but the truth is that it is great. The setting is original ,the characters are interesting ,with the Short Round stealing the show and the action was great ,with amazing comedic timing as well. So I think today everyone see that for the flick has a strong fan base and it is seen as organic part of the Idiana Jones trilogy ( Crystal Skull don't count, if you mention it ,I will scarifies you to Kali!).As I wrote for the character I want to center to Short Round, the kid plays very well and he is at times saves Indi himself, so he is a bad ass before he hits puberty! The other great about him is that we see that Indianna is more than a kick ass professor, for we see here an amazing father son relationship between this two character show a kinder side of Jones which makes him more human and when danger is up on them you want them to succeed and also the fact they both can hold their ground on their on makes them even more awesome. So together a a force to be record with, think Batman and Robin if it was good!!The setting for the flick is the Indian jungle where all of snakes call home and we all know ,who doctor Jones feels about these reptiles!! The story has to say the truth some elements of the white savior and some wrong stereotypes about Indian culture ,but it makes up for it with great dialogue ,some twist to the formula and of course to music. For real I seriously believe that Spielberg want to see how far could go and not been call a racist, well if the final product it that and not Kingdom of the Heavens then fine by me.In short is better the the Raiders of the Lost Ark ,no but still is a good Indianna Jones movie and is really good so I think critics at the time were to politically correct and had zero taste in action flicks. Definitely a awesome action film , which has also a cult status!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
199,AnonymousbutDilpreet002,Reminds me of the 90's Bollywood,1,20 March 2020,"For a strange reason, I was reminded of 90's Bollywood film(Considred as the dark period of Bollywood). In late 80's and 90's Bollywood action films, you will see elements of everything be it romance, comedy, adventure and obviously, over the top action .I as well as the critics hate them, but I can say one thing for sure, there had the ability keep the lay audience hooked for the whole screen time. The second part of Indiana Jones franchise contains everything that a typical film of that period had, except for the entertainment factor. It's mindless action, comedy, adventure film, tries it's hand at everything and makes a mess of it.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
200,mmallon4,Fortune & Glory,10,18 May 2015,"Ah, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. One of those films which I thought was beloved for many years until the advent of the internet in which I discovered it actually gets a lot of stick. Well never fear Temple of Doom, as I am here to defend you against waves of undeserved criticism. So hold onto yo potatoes, it's time for a controversial review of unpopular opinion.I'll begin my defense of Temple of Doom by discussing the movie's two not so beloved supporting characters. First up its Short Round as delightfully played by child actor Jonathan Ke Quan. I love Short round for several reasons with the first being the endearing relationship he shares with Indiana Jones. Unlike Indy's other companions, Short Round idolizes Indy. The moment in which Indy places Short Round's cap on his head after freeing him from the Thuggee cult's spell perfectly sums up their relationship and it gets me every time. Short Round saves Indy's life on multiple occasions; In fact, sometimes I wonder how he's even still alive without him. In comparison to a more beloved character in the series, Henry Jones senior, who almost gets Indy killed on a number of occasions thus rendering the criticism of Short Round being a hindrance to Indy invalid. But I hear you say, Short Round has an annoying voice? - Not at all. Short projects a voice of juvenile innocence and adventure. Short Round is like a kid's fantasy, what's cooler than getting to be Indiana Jones' sidekick? Who wouldn't want to be Short Round? Well, I'd rather be Indy himself, but being Short Round is the next best thing.But how do I defend Willie Scott?! This bastion of female serotypes! Oh please, quit the feminist double standard. Outrage is none existent when a character exhibits male stereotypes (not that there should be). Shouldn't true equality between the sexes allow for a female character to be portrayed as incompetent rather than imposing creative limitations on how women can be portrayed in fiction.For those who call Willie annoying; well let's agree to disagree. I've never found the character of Willie to be annoying and I believe one of the reasons for this is that she is punished for her selfish actions throughout the film. Her character is supposed to be unlikeable and the movie is fully aware of this by making her receive comeuppance. Willie holds some similarities with Marilyn Monroe in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes with her preoccupation with diamonds and her intention to get rich by marrying a particular wealthy gentleman, only to find out they're a child. Just like Monroe, Capshaw displays a wide range of facial expressions and excels in her comedic timing. During the movie Willie matures, she shows concern for Indy and Short Round during the later portion of the film and even punches bad guys during the mine cart chase, a far cry from her earlier self. I love this trio of characters, so yeah, what are you going to do about it?!Temple of Doom begins not with the build-up to an action scene but rather a musical number (with the opening shot of the gong is surely a little tribute to the Rank Organisation). I've never heard every rendition of Cole Porter's Anything Goes but surely this has to be the best version of the tune with Kate Capshaw singing it in Mandarin. The superb rendition of the song along with the dance choreography, the costumes and shear sparkling on-screen, this may be the greatest musical number from a non-musical film. It might seem odd to start an Indiana Jones movie with a musical number but as it captures the 1930's setting and exotic tone of the series so against the odds it works and works magnificently. Temple of Doom even serves as a travelogue for India with its gorgeous landscapes, accompanied by John Williams at his most exotic.Temple of Doom is a film that doesn't beat about the bush and gets over the top very quickly. This is another aspect that sets it apart from Raiders and Last Crusade as the action in Temple of Doom is the least plausible from the original three movies; hence why moments such as the trio escaping from the plane via jumping out of it on a rubber raft come under criticism. However, I believe there's a fine line between action being implausible but not the point in which you can't suspend your disbelief (yes I'm looking at you Nuke the Fridge) and I feel Temple of Doom achieves this fine line. The second half of Temple of Doom is one huge roller coaster ride with many classic B-movie and adventure serial pitfalls; a room with a descending spiked roof, a conveyor belt with a crushing roller at the end, a scene atop a rope bridge and the best of all, the mine cart chase sequence - an absolute master class of action movie filmmaking. After the trio escape from metaphorical hell, the final kiss between Indy and Willie is one of the most satisfying in all of cinema.Temple of Doom is too juvenile you say? You're saying juvenile like it's a bad thing. I like all the weird creepy stuff; the bugs, the monkey brains, hearts being ripped out of people's chests. It's repulsive in the best sense of the word. But Temple of Doom isn't a stupid film. No one ever seems to mention Indy's character arc of overcoming his selfish streak. During the first half of the film, he is only concerned with obtaining his ""fortune and glory"". Even after visiting the baron village and obtaining the Sankara Stones, his personal gain remains his only objective. It's not until he sees with his own eyes the children in slave labour that he changes his ways. Likewise, people praise The Empire Strikes Back for being ""dark"", why doesn't this logic of darkness being synonymous with quality not work for Temple of Doom?But let's get into the real serious stuff - the film's portrayal of Hinduism. I don't claim to be an expert on Hinduism but I'll attempt to the best of my ability to defend this most controversial aspect of the film. The villains of Temple of Doom, The Thuggee, were a cult who resided in India over several hundred years who would strangle travelers and steal their belongings (hence the origin of the term 'thug'). The Thuggee were followers of the Hindu Goddess Kali, however, in Hinduism, Kali is not an evil entity, but rather the goddess of time, change and energy. As what The Thuggee believes is not what Kahali stands for, it makes the villains more interesting as they religious extremists, desecrating a faith for their own selfish gain, such as The Westro Baptist Church to Christianity or Isis to Islam. I believe the filmmakers are aware of this, as evident in the scene towards the end of the film on the dangling rope bridge. Just before Indy sends Mola Ram to his death, he utters ""You betrayed Kali!"". Raiders and Last Crusade both show that the God of Christianity exists in the Indiana Jones universe. Does the spiritual power to the Shankara Stones lend legitimacy to Hinduism then?Then you've got the usual crowd with their screams of ""racism!"". Does the movie have a stereotypical portrayal of Indians? I don't see Raiders or Last Crusade having such a loving portrayal of the German people but of course, they're white so it doesn't count. I'm sick of engaging in this game. When a film is labeled for apparent racism I think to myself, was there malicious intent behind it? Temple of Doom doesn't give into any pretense of political correctness with its white saviour protagonist, touchy religious subject matter and stereotypical female lead; deal with it.I consider Temple of Doom to be no less worthy of a film than Raiders or Last Crusade. Like how Temple of Doom dared to be different and the black sheep of the series, I dare not to bow to the will of popular opinion. What are you going to do about it!? For you see my opinion is always correct, except for the times when I am wrong, which is never.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
201,OMTR,A darker Indiana Jones,9,12 November 2019,"The story begins in Shanghai in 1935, where Indiana Jones meets Willie Scott - an American nightclub singer who works there - as well as Short Round - an intrepid eleven-year-old Chinese sidekick - while fighting against the local mafia. After escaping the clutches of triads and flirting with death, Indy and his companions ""land"" in India. In Mayapore, on their way to New Delhi, they meet impoverished villagers who tell them about the Maharaja and a religious sect practicing the slavery of their children, black magic and rituals of human sacrifices in honor of a supposedly local goddess. Professor Jones agrees to rescue these helpless victims and fight back against these criminals in order to restore Justice, free the children from slavery and give the missing sacred stone back to them.Some critics and viewers complained about the darker tone of this second episode, which is actually a prequel. Personally, I consider that this gloomy atmosphere is essential to the criticism of this kind of feudal societies enslaved by liberticidal tyrants and religious cults, which is the backdrop for this ""Temple of Doom"" story.Even if, overall, this episode is very slightly below ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the genius and the know-how of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg bursts once again onto the screen for our greatest happiness.9.7/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

As a prequel, it shows Indy's adventures before the Ark and the battle against a demonic cult. It's also the movie where Spielberg met his current wife. She was annoying but kind of funny in this. She screamed a lot here which made a lot of people complain, but I don't see how that's any different from what Fay Wray did in the original King Kong. Anyway, that's not the point. We get action in Asia and a look at India, one of the major nations of that aforementioned continent. It's hardly Bollywood material but it's good entertainment. Short Round was also good as Indy's sidekick and he really helped out. You'll see what I mean when you watch so as to avoid spoilers. This might be the darkest of the Indy films but it's not bad.

The poison drink, the abandonment of the airplane, the weird stones, crazy human sacrifice rituals. Why does drinking blood induce somebody in a zombie-like trance? I suppose it has something to do with the rituals, but it never was fully explained. But, hey, it was fun to watch.Some parts, like the fighting in the mines, was over the top. How long of a rail line is that? Seemed improbable for such a long chase. But then again, many things in the movie were over-the-top.In conclusion, its not a bad film.

206,bluesman-20,If Adventure has a name it must be Indiana Jones.,10,28 February 2008,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Not as great as Raiders of the lost ark and more darker then Raiders of the lost Ark. But this movie consistently delivers the thrills chills and action that the movie going audience wanted from a sequel to Raiders. The Darker theme does tend to put off some people. Which is understandable given that sacrifices and child stealing is not your normal them for a action film. But Lucas and Spielberg and Ford make it work they play to the films strengths and the movie is made that much better for it. Kate Capshaw however is not the unusual Damsel in distress and at times her Willie Scott can be annoying but I guess it's because Lucas and Spielberg wanted to create a new heroine for Indy who would be I guess a little Wimpy. But Willie does grow on you by the movie's end. My biggest question at the movie's end is what does Happen to Short Round? They actually created a dynamic here that works and it makes you care about this kid and as a result I want to see further adventures of Indiana Jones and Short Round. I saw this movie when it was first released and it became one of my favorites and now 24 years later it's still one of my all time favorites.

It really is ultra-violent, and it has some too childish moments (the table scene, which I remember commenting in kindergarten), but, for however ""no"" this movie may be, i'll be compelled to shout ""yes!"". For we are on Spielberg's home territory, and he was doing the thing he liked the most. And I must say that he didn't fail. ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" may be a popcorn movie, but audiences won't forget it after they see it. There are just too damn historical moments for it to pass by: the club obi wan shootout scene behind the gong, the descending ceiling with spikes, the mine-cart sequence, the giant wave, the rope bridge... you name it. I also thought that Indy explored new limits to his sanity, and Harrison Ford show his true potential. The film is finely crafted, John Williams' score is a oscar-nominated must, and we get in touch with a director's ability to become a child for two hours and even so managing to get out of it and do the beautiful and mature ""Empire of the Sun"".

209,mnpollio,Underrated prequel,8,1 May 2007,"While not in the same class as Raiders of the Lost Ark, this prequel is still an enjoyable and rousing romp through serial/cliffhanger territory and remains the most underrated of the current Indiana Jones trilogy. Adventurer-archaeologist Indiana Jones barely escapes with his life from the opening adventure with blowsy nightclub singer Willie Scott and street urchin Short Round in tow. After an airplane mishap, they find themselves stranded in India and coerced into searching for sacred stones being used by a Thuggee cult.If anything, this entry seems more exotic than its predecessor. While the screenplay does not have the intelligence of Raiders and is all too willing to sacrifice believability for thrills, then one must also admit that the film is paced like a speeding bullet and it is only after it concludes that anyone is really given the breathing space to notice its flaws. The all-stops-out roller-coaster thrill ride which keeps attempting to top itself is well within keeping to the genre to which it pays its respects.Technically the film is very much at the same level as Raiders, although there were a few visual effects that could have used touching up. The Thuggee cult of India is an interesting choice of villains and Amrish Puri's malevolent priest Mola Ram is rather intimidating. Ford virtually owns the Indiana Jones role by now and has the audience's support and willingness to go along on another adventure almost immediately. Although I really miss Karen Allen for this outing, I don't find Kate Capshaw at all the detriment that many insist. I credit director Spielberg and producer Lucas for trying a completely different route and presenting us with a daffy prima donna with a hilariously shrill scream that cannot cope with bugs or dirt and suddenly finds herself thrust into an adventure that includes all that and more. Ke Huy Quan is also quite effective, if overused, as Short Round. He seems to help move the plot forward without falling into the aren't I cute school of child acting. My largest complaint is that in the second half when Capshaw's character starts becoming more reliable they should have transferred some of Quan's proactive action scenes to her. As it stands, Quan does increasingly ridiculous fight scenes, which could have easily gone to making the female lead more accessible.At the end of the day, it is a worthy prequel and deserves its spot in the pantheon of action films.

215,stormhawk2021,One of my favorite sequels,9,19 June 2017,"Following the massive success of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", it was inevitable that a sequel would follow. No sane minded, or financially aware, production company would ever dream of missing the opportunity to boost a few more zero's on their bank accounts. And so... the sequel made it to the screen three years later. Now, some have given this second adventure a bit of hard time but I happen to think it's a very underrated and action packed addition to the adventures of the whip- cracking, fedora-wearing Dr. Jones that we have come to know and love. This time, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is in search of the Sankara Stones - artifacts that an ancient village believe has protected them for generations and with the recent disappearance of their children, only the stones will bring them back, as well as, the protection of their people. As is customary, Indy agrees to the exploration, but he does so with wanted (and unwanted) people in tow. Although a follow- up, Indy's second adventure actually precedes Raiders by one year (essentially making it the beginning of the franchise) and this time were we find ourselves in 1935. The Nazi's haven't occupied Europe, yet Indy is still going about his endeavors with just as much bravery and commitment as we'd expect. His (and our) adventure begins in China before moving onto India as Spielberg and Lucas leave behind the Nazi adversaries and opt for a more world exploration in the travels of our favorite archaeologist. Some might argue that the Nazi's were part of the draw in Raiders - and I'd agree with them. Who doesn't like the Nazi's being challenged? However, what can't be argued, is that Spielberg still hasn't lost his touch in concocting an exciting matinée yarn. Even though the Nazi's are omitted (and missed) as villains, the second installment adds to the overall sense of world wide adventures that Indy has experienced. That being said, many viewers were not happy with this film. It's a little more bubble-gum entertainment than the solidity of it's predecessor but when the character and his escapades are so much fun, it's still very difficult not to be drawn in. Let's face it, Raiders was an achievement that was never going to be surpassed but I admire Spielberg and Lucas' determination in trying. For example, the escape from a nosediving airplane by rubber dingy is genius action material, as is, the roller coaster chase through the mines and the (hugely iconic) ultimate rope bridge showdown make up some of the best action set-pieces in any of the films. In fact, the opening rolling gong at the Shanghai nightclub and mine shaft chase were originally planned for parts of Raiders but they couldn't fit it in. You could also say that the sense of humour was diminished in favor of a darker tone (leaving this to be one of the first films to ever be prescribed a newly appointed PG-13 rating). Once again, Ford embodies the role with such commitment and believability and despite the dark tone, Spielberg still retains a sense of humour with the incorporation of damsel in distress Willie Scott (a gleefully entertaining Kate Capshaw) and child sidekick ""Short round"" (a perfectly cast Ke-Huy Quan) and his action skills are, simply, at the peak of his powers. Despite it possessing some of the most iconic scenes and confrontations of Indy's adventures, this had been pilloried for being a lackluster follow-up. It does have faults, for sure, but this is still one of most underrated of action adventures that Hollywood (or Spielberg) has ever produced.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
216,dimplet,Real Indians don't eat monkey brains for dessert.,7,2 August 2011,"The movie opens with an overweight oriental man naked above the waist swinging a mallet against a giant gong. Overlaying the gong is the text: A Lucasfilm Ltd. Production, as he strikes the gong three times, and the film begins. Now that's humor! It sets the tone for the rest of the movie, which, although pretending to be scary and dark, is perhaps the funniest of the Indiana Jones movies. Oh, if you don't get the joke, your not a real film buff.Next we see a hot babe singing in Chinese, French and English, with tons of chorus girls. This is Shanghai in 1935. Spielberg did another film set in Shanghai in 1941, and actually filmed in Shanghai: Empire of the Sun. It was essentially a British colony back then, until the Japanese invaded.And who is that hot babe singing Cole Porter's ""Anything Goes""? Kate Capshaw? Never heard of her. Oh, sorry, Mrs. Spielberg.If you look up the lyrics to ""Anything Goes,"" one of the most notorious American pop songs, you will see why it was better sung in Mandarin, considering this is a children's movie. The song is more a comment on 1930s Shanghai than the subsequent action, or lack of it, for Indiana Jones is a gentleman. I thought the way Indy gets dragged into his latest adventure in India, starting from a ritzy nightclub in Shanghai, was clever. The scenes of child slave labor inside a cave have a primeval resonance, but are not as scary as they look, at least to an adult. It's more camp, which is OK.The Indian government was reluctant to allow the movie to be filmed in India. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford, what's to agree to? Oh, a bribe. Either the government ministers were stupid, corrupt, or, more likely, both. When was the last time you met an Indian government official with a sense of humor? About as rare as a TSA inspector who can take a joke.Not good for India's image. Racist stereotypes, according to one reviewer here, and according to the Indian government, which originally banned the film. (Yeah, here we go again, the old ""Americans are racists"" because of some Hollywood movie.) In my opinion, anyone who forms opinions about the real world based on an Indiana Jones movie, especially this one, which is pure fantasy, is delusional and beyond hope. Like we're going to think that all Indians make daily human sacrifices and eat monkey brains for dessert, though they do look tasty. Someone doesn't have a sense of humor.There is one element of truth: there were Thuggees, who robbed travelers and had a secret society with a religious element, which is not unusual, as everyone in India (except Indiana, despite his name) has some religious angle; India may have as many religious sects as France has cheeses.Jonathan Ke Quan does a great job. It always amazes me how anyone can play a starring role in their very first film, especially a kid. This is a fun film, but is probably scarier for kids than adults. I wasn't going to write a review, until I saw the nonsense that had been posted. If you haven't seen this and you like good movies, you will enjoy it, as long as you don't take it too seriously. For kids 15 and under, I would rate this a 9 or 10. BTW, if you don't get the opening, watch a Rank Organization film, such as ""The Lady Killers,"" or at least the first two minutes.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

It's absolutely fantastic.With a darker and often more gruesome tone, Temple of Doom leads Dr. Jones from a brawl in a Shanghai bar to a mystical village in India where he learns from the local people that an evil man has stolen their sacred stone and their children. Indy will of course be on the quest to save them.A relentless ride of excitement for 2 hours of entertainment of the highest calibre and also, bugs, insects, corpses, snakes, elephants and the whole thing that we have learned to love about Indiana Jones.A signature film and definitely one of the greatest adventures of all time, by possibly the greatest director of all time.8/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

219,AndreiPavlov,I dislike kids fooling around in action movies,10,16 August 2007,"Usually I dislike kids fooling around in action movies. But here I give up. To me this adventure flick is certainly the best Indiana Jones movie and perhaps even the best action/adventure/thriller movie. It never lets a viewer doze off. A shoot-out in some China restaurant swiftly turns into a car-chase, the car-chase transforms into a psychotic aircraft catastrophe, the aircraft catastrophe gets right to a dinner-table with monkey brains, stuffed snakes, ""delicious"" insects and what-not, the dinner-table rapidly meets an assassination scene, the assassination scene ends in a secret passage swarmed with the crawling creatures and spiked ceiling that is getting lower and lower, then there is a macabre occult episode, child abuse, mass hysteria and escape, insane railway ride, grisly deaths of the baddies, alligators, ...phew - that's nearly all. That is a kind of content for a few adventure flicks, isn't it? But no, Mr Stephen Spielberg stuffs it all in one movie. The right choice. It looks great.Warning! If you are accustomed to usual TV serials (so beloved by housewives) and simple ""sexy"" down-to-earth talkative entertainment (like ""Anshlag""), you will probably get a headache in no time when watching this movie. For a mouldy brain of a modern TV-buff the pace of this one is too speedy. It's not a kind of chewing-gum suspense fantasy adventure - it's a kind of run-while-you-still-can adventure.The choice of the actors could not be better. Actually, this film has greatly affected my evaluation of ""Star Wars"" and ""Blade Runner"". I wished Mr Harrison Ford had not appeared in those productions because he made a perfect Indiana Jones. It happens now and then that one role has a destructive influence on some actor. This is a pure example. I see him in ""Blade Runner"" and cannot treat the project seriously (though I try really hard). I see him in ""Star Wars"" and cannot get rid of his image in a cowboy hat with a whip in his hand. And no thriller with him as the leading star can lure me into watching. No way. He is the sarcastic archaeologist, period.As to the other two Indiana Jones movies, I enjoy the first one (a good ""entrance"" of the hero) but dislike the third instalment (a weak diminuendo with pathetic father-and-son relations, in my humble opinion).What else to say? It's a wild ride. The critically-acclaimed ""E.T."" is boring and unimpressive to me, there is often something wrong with his other movies too (too much sentimentality and self-importance, maybe), but this one is a must-have. Simply outstanding. At least now I know that Mr Steven Spielberg can direct a solid piece of entertainment and keep ""fortissimo"" from the opening shots till the very last ones.A definite 10 out of 10. Thanks for attention.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
220,illbebackreviews,So just because a movie's tone gets darker from its original it gets hate???,9,18 February 2013,"To me, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a great and extremely fun movie which I was a little disappointed when giving it a 9. I enjoyed the story, the characters, loved the visuals, the battles and the music was breath-taking however I thought the villain wasn't as great as it could've been. To me 'Temple of Doom' clearly shows how much greater a villain can be produced by this franchise. However, at first, I was skeptical about watching this due to the bashing this film receives I honestly still don't get why its bashed. To be fair, I love this as much as the first and actually...Even more! This film was extremely dark, intense, action packed and hilarious. The film follows the tale of our one or two heroes and our damsel in distress. Indy sets off to a palace in India by the name of Pankota Palace to return a lost stone that belonged to a poor village which was responsible for the loss of all their children and their protection from danger. At Pankota Palace, a whole lot of trouble and comedy and action ensues... How can anyone not love this movie. Its a lot funnier than the first. Willy is stupid yet hilarious and there's something about her that doesn't make her the Jar Jar. Shorty was such a cool little kid and I just loved him. Besides, the kid who played him had such amazing chemistry with Harrison Ford and I connected and really loved him. The battle scenes in the movie were done better than in the first in general but 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' has the truck chase action scene that cannot be topped.This movie is extremely action packed, suspenseful, hilarious, emotional, down right frightening and just brilliant. Every aspect of the first film that was great is just as great to me in this second installment in what is easily one of my favorite sequels of all time. The new John Williams soundtrack is extremely brilliantly done, the story is very fascinating and honestly, I prefer this over its original- which to me says a lot! I can conclude here that everything I loved about 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is to me, done better in a darker, funnier, more intense and frightening sequel...which is surprisingly enough a prequel!?! Definitely a must see and definitely a must ignore critics film. You will truly miss a lot of fun watching this movie!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
221,Rcwilkinson123,"Weak link of the series, but still better than your average action-adventure film",6,22 May 2008,"There is no doubt that 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' is the weak link of the famous trilogy (now a quadrology), but overall it is still more interesting than the average adventure movie. There are several films in this genre that are much worse than 'Temple of Doom.'The movie starts unexpectedly, with a musical. But soon thereafter begins a thrilling fight scene and car chase, and hardly lets up from there. While there are points in the movie that are outright disgusting and utterly ridiculous, you have to realize that if 'Temple of Doom' had not had these elements, it wouldn't have made 'The Last Crusade,' an amazing movie, fresh. Had 'Temple' followed the same formula as 'Raiders,' 'Crusade' wouldn't have been as enjoyable.Complaints about Indy's love interest and sidekick seem to be overexaggerated sometimes. Yes, Kate Capshaw's character may scream a bit too often, but she was a different sort of love interest than the tomboyish, tough Marion Ravenwood. Had Capshaw's character been similar to Karen Allen's, then the complaint would have been that Indy's women were becoming too generic. Plus, the whole ""he'll be back in five minutes scene"" is very funny and well-done. Then you've got Short Round, who some complain to have been far too annoying (see Jeff Vice in his review of 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.') Yes, when Shorty goes Jackie Chan on the Thuggee members, you've got to shake you're head at that. But you've got to enjoy seeing basically the same character that pops up in another one of Spielberg's works, 'The Goonies,' always giving Indy a hard time. When Lucas lets the audience see Dr. Jones from Shorty's perspective, it serves to make the archaeologist more of a hero to depend on.So, 'Temple' is the weak link, what with ripping out of hearts and voodoo dolls, there are the comic moments (Indy not having his gun vs. the swordfighters) that don't quite make up for the overwhelming darker moments, but considering that storywriter George Lucas had been going through a divorce at a time that he wrote it, that's understandable. Overall, there's still a lot to like about the middle part of this trilogy.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
222,stills-6,A childish sequel to a true adult adventure,4,18 September 1999,"I was disappointed with the script, the supporting cast, and many of the stunts. That said, Harrison Ford proves that he can belong in any movie no matter how bad it is.Beyond the opening Lao Che sequence, the story is contrived and surprisingly dull. I thought Capshaw was effectively annoying, but there was very little beyond her veneer that made me want to care what happened to her. This is true for many of the other characters as well. The whole thing seems rather childish, as if adult emotions do not exist. I got the feeling I was watching a hyped-up version of another Spielberg movie, ""The Goonies"", an adolescent adventure movie.""Doom"" lacks the irreverent humor, the excitement, and the audacity of the other two movies in this series.

224,Indy-52,All the Indiana Jones movies are extremely enterta...,8,9 February 2001,"All the Indiana Jones movies are extremely entertaining, but if I had to choose one that's not quite on a par with the others, it would have to be the middle film, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom.  Not that it's a bad movie by any means -- it's more entertaining than 3/4 of the movies out there.  It's just that the other two are so amazingly entertaining that this one pales a bit in comparison.  The fact that it looks like a retread of Gunga Din, and the fact that there are no nasty Nazis present also detract from the proceedings. We meet our archaologist friend Indy (Harrison Ford) in a Chinese nightclub where the American cabaret singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) is singing. After narrowly escaping death thanks to the help of Indy's young friend Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan), they find themselves trekking across India in order to find a missing magical stone that have been stolen from the guru of the village of Chattar Lal (Roshan Seth).  They are also looking for the children of that particular village, who, they find out later, have all been stolen and put into child slavery by the evil Mola Ram (Amrish Puri).  Of course there's a big showdown, in which hearts are torn out of chests, monkey's eyeballs are served as a main course, bridges holding a hundred people collapse, and Indiana temporarily becomes a bad guy.  Everything turns out right in the end, though. There's no doubt that Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom is very amusing. It has some great moments:  funny gross-out jokes, an amusement park-type ride through a coal mine, and perilous situations taken from old comic books.  But the fact remains that it seems as if the cast is going through the motions in this one.  Unlike the other two films, Temple Of Doom seems to forgo characterization and plot development in favor of action sequences that don't necessarily feature as much exciting action as in its predecessor.  Nevertheless, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom is a very enjoyable film, and definitely worth a rental to bring you back to being a kid again.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Heck, i liked it even more than ""Raiders""! By now i realise i was wrong: This movie isn't as good as its predecessor. It's true that raiders wasn't perpetual action like this one, but it had a better story. However, getting back to Temple, i don't understand how you couldn't like this one. It's a non stop thrill ride from start to finish, which is packed with laughs, gruesome scenes, horrific dinners and misterious cult ceremonies. Whoever starts watching it, is guaranteed not to stick his eyes off the screen until the end. Although it doesn't top Raiders, it sure is better The Last Crusade(which is a lame ripoff from it).

They also had a bit of an unnecessary scene (when Indy touches girl statue, and when he is hinting with the girl about sexual interest).But other than that, I loved the film, it was great, comical humor, and it had all the great stunts I expected, from the roller coaster ride to the simple 'camping in the wilderness and the female freaking out' stuff.The swearing was almost none, and the acting was fantastic!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
228,HelloTexas11,fast-paced but poorly executed,5,28 July 2008,"Granted that the 'Raiders' franchise is built around a certain degree of freneticism, a lot of dashing to and fro, 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' really goes over the top with it and the result is a disjointed, herky-jerky film with a lot of action and very little point. The film just isn't as well put-together as the other two (we'll leave the most recent addition for another day) and plays like a very fast-paced card trick that is meant to distract you from the fact that the magician's act isn't very good in the first place. The plot is part of the problem. It's so insubstantial, it's difficult to even remember as you're watching the film. At least in the other two movies, there was a degree of curiosity on the audience's part as to what powers the Lost Ark might contain, and whether the Holy Grail really existed. In 'Temple of Doom,' I frankly couldn't have cared less whether Indy found the magic stone and returned it to its village. It sounds like something Spielberg and Lucas dreamed up on the set during a coffee break when they realized they needed a plot. If there's a sense of blown opportunity here, it's with the lead female character, Willie. Kate Capshaw is, hands down, the most appealing and fetching of the series' first three leading actresses, and it's just her bad luck that she got stuck in the worst film of the three. The script doesn't give her much to do other than show exasperation, but she shows it about as well as it can be shown, and the fact her character isn't given more to do just reinforces the general air of disappointment one feels with 'Temple of Doom.' One of the best moments in the film is an all-too-brief flirtation between her and Indiana Jones, but like every other bright idea in the movie, it is cut short so we can move on to something else. Short Round (Jonathat Ke Quan), the young Chinese boy who Indy seems to have adopted, is an amusing character and has a few funny lines. In another movie, he might have made more of an impact as well. Here, he's strictly comic relief. The one bit everyone seems to remember from 'Temple of Doom' is the gross-out eating scene in some palace. Raw snakes, giant beetles, and monkey brains (served in the original monkey heads, no less) are consumed with great gusto, while a horrified Kate Capshaw looks on. It's probably the best staged scene in the film. Not much, I know, but with 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,' the pickings are pretty slim.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

I have been watching the Indiana Jones films in time for the latest release ""Kingdom of the crystal skull"". I had never seen a Indiana Jones film until a couple of days ago. I have to say i have been having a great time.This time around it focuses more on its humor and comedy then the great adventure that we were blessed with in the first Indiana movie. Which is a real shame. It had less then a quarter of the adventure that Raiders had.Indiana Jones was great but his sidekick and lady were annoying at times. After seeing Raiders of the Lost Ark i didn't think Jones needed a sidekick but this is a prequel and he was mostly there just for laughs. Jones sidekick comes in the form of a small Chinese kid. He has some good lines and the kid who played him was a good actor. But it seems he weighs Indiana down at times. Now to the lady. Again not as good as Marion Ravenwood from the first one. She can be really whinny and is always getting Jones and his sidekick in trouble.The films opens in a Shanghai restaurant where we see Indiana Jones in a James Bond look. Here he meets and flees with a singer called Willie Scott. Along with Willie and his sidekick shorty they accidentally board a plane owned by the bad guy. The pilots leave the plane while there flying and the gang crash in Indian village where the villagers ask Jones to go to the Temple of Doom and take some stones and save the villagers children. The story was good and well told.The only thing that was better then the original was the visual effects but they don't make up for the rest of the movie.I still recommend this but don't expect it to be better than the original.

Thats the feeling when watching the Temple of Doom. The positive points are, that it carries at least half the weight of the original i.e. character, plot, story. Neggatives are that it didn't lay out anywhere near as much action as the fist one.

The movie is darkest one in this fun and adventure series with lots of haunting background score, images and sequences of torture such as taking a live heart out of a alive man. Being set in India, there are many Indian characters, two of them played by known names like Amrish Puri and Roshan Seth.

You have to at least give the film credit for that, and I even liked Short Round who many thought was annoying but I thought him and our favorite archeologist had good chemistry with! I will say that I did not care for his love interest though, who screamed way too much and was a nuisance throughout most of the film. And I also didn't mind the violence!

He agrees, stumbling upon a Kali Thuggee religious cult plotting child slavery, black magic and ritual human sacrifice. It's much darker and scarier than the other films, with quite a lot of brutality thrown in. But the movie is great fun, with Harrison Ford at the top of his game and a handful or so of great fight and action scenes that garb you by the throat and never let go.

235,ryan_kuhn,"""Hey, Dr. Jones, no time for love. We've got company.""",7,2 October 2006,"After the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the sequel was inevitable. George Lucas came up with the story and Steven Spielberg again directed this second adventure in the Indiana Jones serial. The high energy and joy seen in Raiders of the Lost Ark has been replaced with a darker, more serious adventure, as Indiana is charged with recovering a magic stone for a village in India who has seen drought and all of the children have gone missing. The beginning of the movie is the high point of the film, with an extravagant musical number in club Obi Wan (oh, that George Lucas and his inside Star Wars jokes), a Shanghai night club where Indiana is closing a deal over artifacts from the Chinese dynasty. Kate Capshaw is the featured singer and the latest ""Indiana girl"" in this film, a movie that, curiously enough, occurs BEFORE Raiders of the Lost Ark, so the suspense of Jones' fate (if there really was any) is removed, and so any potential love affairs that fail to carry over between movies. Also missing is John Rhys-Davies' Sallah and Deholm Elliot's Brody, instead, we get to see Indy's child helper, Short Round, who's job is to go into tight quarters and say ""Doctor Jones"" about 300 times. The plot is complicated, as I had to watch the movie a couple of times to get an idea of was actually happening, and, unlike the previous film, most of the movie happens in one place. The famous scene in this movie is the dinner at the palace, where the visitors are treated to chilled monkey brains and other appealing meals. The movie does feature a fantastic scene with an underground rail system that turns into a chase sequence that is filmed well and is enjoyable to watch. This film does not have the whimsy or innocence seen in the other two Indiana movies, and suffers because of it. While still an enjoyable film, it is the least of the three Indiana movies.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
236,mirwais-orbit,"Indie comes, Indie goes... Indie comes again...",9,1 August 2007,"Well, when we talk about 80's action movies we have to remember about simple things like: they were always as fantastic as Alice in Wonderland, they usually never research for anything before write a screenplay, there was always a blond yummy lady and the hero was always supposed to be funny. That were the THINGS about an 80's action movie.I read a lot of reviews here talking about the Indian culture and the disrespect for it by the writers. Someone here said that ""voodoo dolls"" never was a part of Indian culture. Well, but it was a part of a lot of people's mind for ages before the movie mainly for American people. The writers just took all this foreign myth to create all that nonsense about demons and voodoo dolls in Indian culture. I totally agree that it was a huge mistake do that if we were talking about a modern action movie, but we're not! At that time people never believed what the movie was talking about and they never thought if indians really loved demons or not for a very simple reason: PEOPLE WAS NEVER TOOKING MOVIES TOO SERIOUSLY AT THAT TIME!!! At that time people was just trying to get some fun and f*ck the plot. That was all about.About Willie Scott being an annoying character, I do not believe that. I really believe that Spielberg just made her as woman should be for the 80's. In the beginning of the movie she's an artist, she's a woman living in fashion and money and everything about diamonds, and at the end of the movie she's a very totally different kind of woman and that is what was happening to women at that time. The other reason that I love her character is that she is the opposite side of Marion, and mixing Marion and Willie, we get Elsa Schneider, the fabulous, adventurous and villain character of Last Crusade.But I really believe that Temple Of Doom is the worst edited movie of the series.

Jones made his first appearance as the star of Raiders of the Lost Ark. However, I found Raiders of the Lost Ark confusing, boring, and hard to hear. However, Temple of Doom changed my look on the famous archaeologist. Indiana Jones: Temple of Doom is a totally different film from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indiana Jones: Temple of Doom features a great adventure/fantasy story with remarkable characters, such as Indiana Jones the archaeologist, Winnie the spoiled rich girl, a crazy guy who rips peoples hearts out, a little kids with voodoo dolls and (most importantly) Short Round (nicknamed by Indy) the little Chinese kid who helps Mr. Jones on his quest.

She is there primarily as a foil for the action.`Short Round' (Ke Huy Quan) is a better foil and plot device though  He moves the action and facilitates the story as needed.  Ke Huy Quan (now billed as Jonathan Ke Quan) has not made a film since 1992's `Encino Man'  he is a good actor and it would be nice to see him on the screen again.This installment has what is arguably the best cinematography in the trilogy: there are astounding views of mountains, sheer cliffs hanging over rivers and magnificent interiors.John Williams score is definitely weaker than most of his work  the only memorable piece of music in the film is in the opening number  which is by Cole Porter.While this is not the best of the Indiana Jones movies, when it is compared to other action/adventure films, it still is one of the better ones.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
240,michael_the_nermal,Pulp Fiction,6,25 September 2008,"After seeing ""The Crystal Skull"", I decided to see one of the most famous of the ""Indiana Jones"" installments. Now I realize the archaeology teachers and writers I've experienced had it all wrong. ""Temple of Doom"" proves that ""Indiana Jones"" is pure fantasy. Nothing in this movie is remotely related to reality, except for some passing mention of the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny. It's Spielburg And Lucas's homage to fast-paced, nonstop-action adventure movie serials of the 1930s, which in turn were derivative of ""King Solomon's Mines"" or anything written by pulp adventure novelists. Stop worrying, academics of the ivory tower! Nobody will believe Indiana Jones is even remotely close to a real archaeologist.With that out of the way, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is exciting and fun and delivers on the thrills and spills one would expect from an adventure movie. The Temple of Doom set is superlatively designed, an is quite convincing as a scary, demonic place. The mine cart chase is one of the most classic scenes in cinema history, certainly in the top ten somewhere---though I suspect it was based on a mine cart chase from an earlier adventure serial. I wonder why Disneyland based their Indiana Jones ride on a Jeep rather than the familiar mine cart in the Thuggee gem mines. It would have been very exciting to slide back and forth an ""Mr. Toads Wild Ride"" meets ""Space Mountain"" adventure ride in a mine cart.Anyway....The acting is decent. Harrison Ford cements his role as an action hero. Fans of the timeless classic ""The Goonies"" will spot the actor who played Data here, in an earlier role. He's very fun to watch as Indy's resourceful and brave sidekick...he almost seems like the inspiration for ""Talespin's"" Kit Cloudkicker. Cate Capshaw is not so great as a scaredy-cat lounge singer/love interest. She has little to do but scream and bulge her eyes at creepy-crawly bugs and reptiles. I am a bit sorry to see the Indian actor who brilliantly played Jawaharlal Nehru in the excellent biopic ""Gandhi"" reduced to playing a generic henchman; he's way too good for this popcorn flick!Accept ""Temple of Doom"" for what it is, any you will really enjoy it. Watch this on Halloween with some friends. It is a classic pulp adventure flick, with all the requisite standard features such a movie would have. Don't expect anything more than that.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
241,stephendaxter,"Does everything you expect an Indiana Jones film to do, but can't live up to the first film",7,12 March 2015,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the second instalment of the Indiana Jones franchise and the prequel, yes, prequel to the first film. The decision to go for a prequel was an interesting one but didn't affect the film at all as it was a different quest to the first film. That aside, for me this film was very disappointing compared to what the first film accomplished. This felt like it was missing a lot of the elements that the first film managed to use so well. Yes this film did have some comedic moments but not as many as the first film and it did have a little more darker horror like scenes, but i felt that this was missing a lot of the awesome action/adventure sequences that made the first film so iconic. This film failed to deliver in that sense, there was some interesting action sequences but i didn't feel that the adventure was there, and i was pretty disappointed. The plot itself was at times pretty interesting and i was invested in what was going on and at times it dragged on and got predictable. I did like the opening, it had the comedy, action and mystery that i loved from the first Indiana Jones. But following their arrival in India they quickly setup the quest they had to go on but then spent quite a bit of time in the village and on the way to their destination, and it wasn't all that interesting. Similarly later on when the mystery gets revealed, it spends a lot of time inside this location that did not feel like Indiana Jones at all. It was a different environment that i was used to seeing him in and it really wasn't too interesting, some of the action was good though.Harrison Ford still did a really good job as Indiana Jones and he was not the problem with this movie. I was not a huge fan of the supporting cast, Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round was decent, his character was there to play as a sort of sidekick to Indiana and was a pretty likable kid. But, i really didn't like Kate Capshaw as Willie Scott, it was more the character that i didn't enjoy watching because i felt like she really didn't belong, if we had Short Round in the film for some comedic relief, i don't see why we needed Willie, i believe she was just there because the plot later on required her to be. John Williams again did a great job with the score but didn't live up to the first. And that really is the best way to describe this whole film, it did a decent to good job in all the categories but unfortunately fell really short of what the first film accomplished. - 6.8",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
242,carologletree,"Not as Good as ""Raiders"" or ""Crusade,"" but Still a Great Adventure Film",8,16 January 2016,"This film has often gotten a bad rap, especially around the time of its release. People have criticized this film for being too dark, violent, and disgusting. This may not be as good as the two films it is sandwiched in between, but it is still a lot of fun and another great Indiana Jones adventure.The problem, of course, is that some scenes are way too violent and disturbing. This makes the movie not quite fit for little children. Another thing, Willie really can grate on your nerves at times with her constant whining and screaming.However, the movie makes up for that in many other ways. Harrison Ford is still phenomenal as everyone's favorite adventure hero. Short Round is an adorable side-kick to Indy, and to be fair, Willie wasn't quite as annoying in the second half of the movie.Unlike some people, I actually quite enjoyed the dark tone of the movie. The story was pretty cool, with Indy looking to find the Sankara stones and save the people of the village's children.The action scenes once again deliver. The chase out in Shanghai is exciting, as is when the gang makes it out of the plane and ride in a raft. The mine cart chase was relentless; it was like being on a roller-coaster ride. The bridge scene was also filled with great tension.The scenery in India is really nice and we once again get a rousing music score.This is another classic Indiana Jones adventure. This may be the weakest of the original trilogy, but it's still way better than the fourth film.RATING: A-",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
243,Ibuk,Not bad 2nd Indy movie,6,9 May 2010,"With this review I will have reviewed all of the Indy movies on IMDb. For years I had despised this second Indy outing and last week I sat down to rewatch it after a good number of years and to my surprise I ended up enjoying it. TOD is pure excitement from beginning to end,the opening twenty minutes is simply breathtaking and the rope bridge sequence is easily the best thing ever done in an Indiana Jones movie. The plot as it goes involves Indy ending up in an Indian village after almost being killed when his plane crashes. He is accompanied by his sidekick Short Round and a bar singer called Wilhelmina Scott(Spielberg's future wife). Indy is told that a sacred stone has been stolen and that their children have been taken over by evil spirits. So Indy and his two companions go off in he search for the children and the sacred stone. They stay in a Maharajah's palace and later they discover an underground passage which leads them to Mola Ram. What happens after that is a series of exciting chases. Being a huge Bollywood fan the main highlight for me was the casting of Bollywood veteran Amrish Puri. It was his role as Mola Ram that paved a path for him in Bollywood and made him one of Bollywood's best known villains. I will end up saying that whilst TOD has improved quite considerably it is nowhere near as good as Raiders or The Last Crusade. I will rate TOD a 6/10 which is pretty good.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Harrison Ford is again excellent as Indi, but sadly Indi has some slightly annoying sidekicks with him this time! I much prefered Marion in Raiders to Willie in this one as a Indi's female companion (just like James Bond there has to be one!), and Short Round is there strictly to please the kids, like a lot of Spielberg films. I do remember I absolutely loved this film as an 11 year old watching it in the cinema, but as an adult it doesn't compare to Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Last Crusade.

249,Idiot-Deluxe,ONLY in Temple of Doom...,10,20 October 2016,"...has action and atmosphere EVER merged so potently and so perfectly. FACT!Well first things first, right from the start I'm going to indulge in a ridiculous and over-blown introduction and a big Thank You to Lucas Films - my eternal gratitude.So 32 years since the release of Temple of Doom what hasn't already been said about this timelessly tantalizing and insanely awesome action film, probably not too much. But I'll roll out the red carpet especially for it, here goes. Indiana Jones and the Temple Doom - has long stood as one of the towering stalwarts in the: Big-Budget-Block-Buster-Adventure-Film bracket. Largely thanks to George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and most of all, Harrison Ford. Temple of Doom stands as a variety of things, first and foremost, it's cinematic high-art of the highest order and secondly and most obviously, it is the ultimate example of an unrelenting, full-throttle, no-holds-barred, action extravaganza. Plus, on top of all that, it's also the best and MOST EXCITING of all sequels - with the exception of Evil Dead 2. Temple of Doom (in all it's magnificence) sit's firmly at 3rd place on this reviewer's Top 10 List.And now a plot summary for the young and uninitiated:Roll Film: Three years after Raider's (but taking place 1 year earlier in Indy's world) Doctor Jones returns in the grandest of fashion, starting out in bustling down-town Shanghai at the ritzy Club Obi-Wan, where Indy's dealt a trio of betrayals by club owner Lao Che and his sons, balloons fall and Tommy guns roar as all hell breaks loose! Indy and a beautiful blonde club singer escape the mayhem and literally fall into a convenient convertible, where ready at the wheel is a pal of Indy's, a 10 year Chinese kid named Short Round, ""Short Round. Step on it!"" Motoring through the busy streets with Chinese bad-guy's in hot pursuit, they make it to an air-field and after Dan Aykroyd's cameo they take-off. However the 3 of them are unknowingly passengers of ""Lao Che Air Freight"" and treachery is once again right around the corner, the pilot's bail as they sleep, after some frantic maneuverings in the plane, they to bail out in... an untested method of decent. Slamming to earth in their rubber raft it's cross country for a while, then a massive cliff, then a river, then an old Indian wise-man, wordlessly they follow him to his village, which has seen much better times. Convinced that his gods made them fall from the sky, he demands that they go to a certain palace and recover a sacred stone (that was stolen from their village) that possesses magical properties and so on the backs of elephants they ride - onward's to the palace. But before they get there, there are more colorful misadventures along the way, starting with elephantine B.O. and non-existent ""giant vampire bats""! They reach their destination, but not before being abandoned by their guides and rides, on foot they tread to the front entrance of the palace, upon arrival they're greeted by a friendly and dapper host and soon they feast - oh, and WHAT a feast it is! Afterwards Indy kicks some would-be assassins ass, checks in on Willie Scott (the singer) whose hot-and-bothered and oblivious to any danger, soon a suspicious breeze is detected and a hidden passageway is revealed.Start of Act II: Now things REALLY get interesting. After many bugs and booby-traps, Indy, Shorty and Willie find their way into an underground labyrinth, that's inhabited by the remnants of the demonic ""Thugee Cult"" and their leader: Mola Ram. The sacrificial chamber (with lava pit!) remains one of cinemas most visually striking and evil looking film sets, after an incredible show of pyrotechnics Indy attempts to get what they came for (the Stones!), but they all get caught and thrown in chains, Indy drinks some poisonous blood and loses his mind, until Shorty burns him back to reality and they both save Willie from certain fiery death! Escaping the evil clutches of the Thugee's they quickly proceed to free hundreds of slave children deep inside the catacombs. Now to escape Mola Ram's layer, (I find this to be the most exciting moment in the Indiana Jones franchise) and with much adversity they succeed. Eventually finding themselves in a mine cart and a spectacular, high-speed, thrill-ride of murder and mayhem ensues. Watch out for the lava pits! Then, a man-made tidal wave! Literally with foot-a-fire Indy asks for ""WATER! - WATER!"" then suddenly he see's WATER, too much of it in fact! Run like hell is their only option, they run through a tunnel, then a sheer drop-off abruptly comes into view, water and timbers blast through the opening - but yet they out-guile nature once again! Onto the rope bridge, Willie and Shorty cross it with only minor tribulation, but then Mola Ram once again appears, at knife-point their forced back onto the bridge, while Indy at this time is in the middle of said bridge and surrounded by baddies. Now EVERYONE is on that confounded bridge, raising his sword Indy proclaims ""Mola Ram, prepare to meet Kali - in Hell!!!"" he slices the ropes, the bridge snaps and most of the evil Thugee's fall to their death. But now a wrestling match on the shambles of a rope bridge starts up, cutting to it, Indy is victorious and Mola Ram is vanquished, ending with a Wilhelm scream in the jaws of a hungry alligator. Indy and the gang then return to the village, where a miraculous transformation has happened and moments later another miracle, when all the missing children run in and !!REJOICE!! they're reunited with their parents. Indy hands the stone over to the old guy, he bickers with Willie, she walks away, he lasso's her with his whip, pulls her close and they kiss - The End.OK, fine, so it's a summary and not a review.

But, at least it was dark and a great movie!On the other hand, ""Temple of Doom"" is just plain dark. There is little to no fun here, and only the brainless action of the ending kind-of-sort-of redeems it.

Unbelievable plane rescue scene (Hello...007), tasteless dining scene in castle (lack of originality, i guess), unconvincing love & romantic scenes with a ""please-show-me-how-to-act"" Indy girl and far too long cave scenes.

252,cdjh-81125,The Weakest of The Series but Still Great On Its Own,8,29 September 2017,"This is the one film of the Indiana Jones series that I've always been divided upon, when I was young and would watch all these movies over and over again this was the one I would watch the least, mainly because of how scary I found it to be. I re-watched this film again recently and appreciated it a lot more and while it is defiantly my least favourite Indy film it's probably the most admirable one. I loved that this film decided to go for a darker and more gritty tone, it was good to see that Spielberg and Lucas weren't interested in recreating Raiders of The Lost Ark, they made this film stand on its own by making it a fairly scary movie. The blood magic and death cult additions were set up as a very imposing threat that I was always freaked out by. Even though Spielberg has come out and said that he didn't think this was the right choice I respectfully disagree. The use of location was done in a perfect way in this film, the use of the India and the actual Temple of Doom look stunning but they really do give you a sense of dread that the other films didn't, it makes the main story of this movie a truly undesirable situation. This is definitely the most atmospheric of the Indiana Jones films and in many ways the most risky one. The now iconic characters in this movie are some of my favourites of the series. Short Round was the perfect sidekick for this film, he was really funny and had great chemistry with Jones yet you got the sense that he could stand on his one and added a lot to this movie. Mola Ram was a great villain, he didn't have much in the way of motivation but he was definitely the creepiest villain of the franchise. Willie on the other hand added absolutely nothing to this film, I understand that the filmmakers were trying to do something different from Marion in Raiders but they didn't do anything that made her as good as that character. She does nothing in this film but complain and scream, Indiana and Short around have to keep rescuing her over and over again, she slowed down the plot and dragged the film down quite a bit. Another big issue I have with this film is that the prequel concept was completely wasted, it could have been a really good opportunity to show a less experienced character in a scenario he doesn't know how to deal with but instead it just seems like the same for him. It would have been good to see the film pick up after Raiders and see how he came out of that situation for the better and see how he applied his experiences for that film to this one. I really do like this movie, its defiantly my Keats favourite of the four but it's no less enjoyable than the others. It's takes and darker and more mature tone, a great sense of location and new characters but other new characters don't fair as well and they didn't really do anything with the prequel concept. It scared me when I first saw it and it still does to this day.8.1/10: A- (Fantastic)",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

This whole franchise was intended to be a serial adventure and like with any serial adventure, each one is going to bring in different elements. Here, we have a pre-Raiders Indy searching for his fortune and glory. Through the course of the film, Indy becomes the archaeologist we come to meet in Raiders.The darkness of the tone is a sticking point with many, but I for one welcome this change. I thought the inclusion of Shortround, Indy's young sidekick, was a perfect light balance to the darkness. Their chemistry is great. Kate Capeshaw takes a lot of criticism of how Willie is a damsel and I think it is unwarranted. She was no Marion Ravenwood. Don't look at her as Marion. Like Indy's immature quest for fortune and glory, the women in his life at this point were not yet the strong and independent type.The stunts are top notch with the mine cart chase becoming a blueprint for many rollercoasters that were designed throughout the rest of the decade.

258,frankenbenz,The Past...Revisited All Over Again,7,1 May 2008,"In anticipation of the May 22 release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I decided to reacquaint myself with the Indy franchise. Like millions of other kids at the time, Raiders blew my mind. I still remember walking out of the theater with my folks, me boldly declaring ""that was the best film I've ever seen."" Best, as in, better than Star Wars, better than Empire Strikes back, better than everything I had seen up until that point in my life. I've had a lot of love affairs with a lot of great movies since then, but Raiders still holds a place somewhere in my top 100 films of all time.About a month ago I sat down to Raiders and considering how many times I have seen this movie over the years, it wasn't holding my interest like it once did. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood, so I shut it down at about the halfway point. Don't get me wrong, I still love and respect this movie, I just don't feel the need to see it one more time. In defense of other films in my top 100, I maintain an insatiable appetite for many other: Goodfellas, Heat, Kings of the Road, Godfather 1 & 2, Pickup on South Street, almost any Kubrick film, No Country For Old Men and so on. Maybe this is a sign that the fourth installment of Indy might be the biggest letdown of my summer. I'm hoping Iron Man isn't.Today I watched The Temple of Doom, unlike Raiders, something I haven't seen in a very long time. From the opening frame, this movie announces it's bigger, bolder, more colorful, cornier, louder and equally exciting. It's not like Raiders was subtle, but it did manage to let you catch your breath more than once -- TOD does not. I'm sure Spielberg and Co. felt the need to one up Raiders and in doing so they made the decision to cram in as much action in this sequel as they could, right up until the (literal) roller coaster ride climax.Here today gone tomorrow smart ass kid of the month Jonathan Ke Quan plays Short Round, Indy's sidekick and even 20+ years after I first saw this movie, the kid is a standout. Kate Capshaw convincingly plays the cloyingly sassy love interest Willie, and despite her being competent throughout, I can't help but think the best career move she ever made was becoming the Spielberg family matriarch.No, this movie never manages to outdo Raiders, but it is still a fun, mindless romp that pays homage to golden age Hollywood movie-making.

259,piratecannon,He No Nuts... He Crazy!,7,29 December 2012,"Believe it or not, some fanboys debate the superiority of Temple of Doom as opposed to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The consensus seems to be that, for all intents and purposes, Temple of Doom is the better picture. Hashing out which one is ""better"" is certainly a tricky proposition; after all, they contain many of the same elements—as noted in my previous rambling—and are the two Indy films that feature non- Biblical artifacts as MacGuffins.Here's what I think: Temple of Doom is, in fact, a more solidly put together motion picture. On the flip side, I actually enjoy watching Kingdom of the Crystal Skull more than I do the former.But let's focus on the movie in question. Temple of Doom is not Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's that simple. The story isn't as compelling, the romance is duller, and the adventure doesn't have the same sense of urgency that something like the Ark of the Covenant naturally generates. Though there's whip-crackin' aplenty, some of the more hammy scenes (again, this is pre-Crystal Skull) in the entire series rear their ugly faces in this second outing. For me, the worst of the worst is the ""card playing"" scene which involves, Indy, Willie, and Short Round. They've set up camp for the night in a jungle clearing, and while our protagonist and his sidekick are bickering over hidden cards and underhanded tactics, Willie is darting from one side of the set to the other, screaming her head off as a myriad of creatures converge on their location. It might draw a grin from the most ardent of Indy devotees, but it is, to be perfectly frank, an annoying scene.Then there's the blood brain-washing. Dr. Jones is forced to consume some sort of black magic concoction that causes him to turn into a mindless Mol Ram follower. Amazingly, Short Round discovers that the spell can be broken if Indy is taunted with a white hot torch. Er what?Okay, so a lot of this movie doesn't make sense, and it doesn't have one-tenth the charm of its predecessor. But it's still vastly entertaining. Oh, and did I mention there's a cameo by Dan Aykroyd?",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

The best Indiana Jones film ever made.",10,26 April 2020,"It's finally time to write a review on one of my favorite films of all time, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", a prequel to the critical and box office hit, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ('81), which brought the old style of the classic adventure from Republic Pictures to the 80's Era, featuring a daredevil archaelogist, Indiana Jones, which is both a scholar and an adventurer, searching for lost treasures around the world and facing all perils throughout the quest.For its second adventure, George Lucas, the original creator wanted a change in MacGuffin, tone, the villains and even in the Indy girl.
As the Ark of Covenant in ""Raiders"" is a jewish artifact, the Sankara stones in ""Doom"" are related to Hinduism; the tone of the film became darker, eerie and more cynical, in the same vein ""The Empire Strikes Back"" ('80) was to ""A New Hope"" ('77); the villains became the Thuggees instead of the Germans and Marion Ravenwood (played by Karen Allen in ""Raiders""), Indy's longtime lover, was replaced by a new female interest, maybe the major reason why they chose to make ""Doom"" a prequel.The screenwriters, the real life couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, who scripted Lucas' ""American Graffiti"" ('73) and were experts in the Indian culture, were hired to write Lucas' idea to set the film in India, about an evil cult that worships Kali, the Hindu goddess of death, feeding her with human sacrifice, that are searching, using child labour slave in the catacombs of the 'Temple of Doom', for the last 2 of 5 magical stones that together will bring them ilimited power to extinguish the other religions and rule the world.Based in ""Gunga Din"" ('39), the classic adventure film from RKO Radio Pictures starring Cary Grant, and in the James Bond film, ""Live and Let Die"" ('73), the writers worked closely with Spielberg and Lucas to create the dark world of this Indiana Jones' second entry, bringing back the majority of the crew that made ""Raiders"" a masterpiece, including one of the greatest cinematographers that ever lived, the late Douglas Slocombe; the magnificent 'maestro' John Williams and the frantic editor, Michael Kahn.The result might be the greatest adventure film ever made, beating even ""Raiders"", even if it was critically bashed due to the dark tone, not suitable for children (leading to the creation of PG-13, see also ""Gremlins"" and ""Red Dawn"", released in the very same year) and the Indian stereotypes, which in fact were written as a piece of dark humour, totally in tune with the tone of the film, than offensive, but this led to the movie being filmed in Sri Lanka, after refusal from North India to shoot there.Now, why i rate this movie as not only the best Indiana Jones film, but also (probably) the greatest adventure film of all time?First of all, it's less pretentious than ""Raiders' as an epic adventure film, and that isn't necessarily a good or a bad thing, it's just more fun as a rollercoaster ride of purely movie magic, full of entertainment and excitement, that both a kid or a eldery can relate and enjoy.Secondly, artistically and technically it achieves and even improves the original film, ""Raiders"" is an astonishingly well shot film, but Douglas Slocombe's widescreen photography here, especially during the elephants' journey to the Pankot Palace that, like its predecessor, is an homage to the works of art from one of Spielberg's favorites, Sir David Lean, is aesthetically beautiful as an eye pleaser.
Spielberg's direction is risky, daring and politically incorrect, principally from a guy that his previous effort was the more family friendly themed and critics' favorite, ""E.T."" ('82), he denotes here a great sense of dark humour and sarcasm, of pace, of how to stage the action scenes and the mood of a pulp adventure novel perfectly adapted to the big screen. This was the last time Spielberg showed this side of him, of which some of his old fans misses it a lot.
Michael Khan's editing is hallucinating, the movie when enters its third act, never slows down until the end, and John Williams' hauntingly beautiful orchestration, it's the best achievement in musical score of the Indiana Jones' franchise.Thirdly, the cast and their characters, i've never seen Ford as happy, charming, oozing manhood and confident playing Indy than in ""Temple of Doom"", and is also his absolutely best Indiana Jones performance, before he started to spoof his own character in the lacklustre, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" ('89). Even if mostly of the action sequences this time were filmed using Harrison Ford's stunt double, Vic Armstrong, who resembles Ford a lot and also doubled for him in the more risky parts during the truck chase in ""Raiders"", partially due to Ford's back accident during the fight sequence with the Thuggee hidden in the room, Harrison, fortunately, recovered well and came back to shot all the close-ups with renewed energy.
His acting is very good during the trance-like state of the Black Sleep of Kali Ma.Kate Capshaw was widely criticized as the famed Shanghai Club singer, Willie Scott, due to the critics and general public expected Marion Ravenwood to came back or at least, another female 'tomboy' character to replace her.
I think it was a great idea to change the Indy girl to a more feminine 'Damsel in distress' fitting the 'fish outta water' type, a throwback to how the female characters were in those 30's and 40's adventure films, and Kate surely plays it loud and whiny, but there's something about her that sparks throughout the film. She don't have the same chemistry with Indy as Marion had, but she fits well in their scenes together, especially the flirting turned arguing after the dinner scene.
Also, kudos to the make-up and wardrobe department for her, she looks absolutely stunning and never looked better on-screen.The non-caucasian actors delivered memorable performances, suitable to the tone of the film, from Roy Chiao as Lao Che, emulating a Bond villain to perfection; Jonathan Ke Quan as the Indy's sidekick, Short Round, a heroic child character that Lucas and Spielberg created for the children to relate; Roshan Seth as the eerie Chattar Lal, The Prime Minister of the Maharaja of Pankot and the late great Amrish Puri as Mola Ram, the Thuggee high priest, which rips off the hearts of his victims with his bare hand, who is not only the best Indiana Jones villain, but also one of the most macabre and sinister bad guys ever commited to cinema.Dan Aykroyd, Spielberg's actor from ""1941"" ('79) and ""The Blues Brothers"" ('80) in which Spielberg appears as an actor in a short performance, cameos as Webber in the Shanghai airport.Fourthly, when Indiana Jones fans thinks about the character and its adventures, which memorable scenes comes to mind ?
Well, ""Raiders"" opening in the South American jungle; the swordsman in Cairo; the Well of Souls and the truck chase, but also the musical opening and the escape from Obi Wan Club in Shanghai; the plane crash; the dinner scene; the spike chamber; the Thuggee ritual; the black sleep of Kali Ma; the mine chase sequence (even if sometimes the miniatures are way too visible) and the superbly directed and photographed, rope bridge sequence, which is the best standoff from the franchise. It's all from ""Doom"". How many from the boringly safe ""The Last Crusade"" a true Indiana Jones fan can mention ?In short, ""If adventure has a name, it must be Indiana Jones"", perfectly describes this masterpiece to the full, and Spielberg and Lucas that started jumped on the bandwagon of the ""Doom"" haters, claiming that the movie is depressing and dark because both were during marital problems and / or divorces around that time, what i can say is that they should then divorce again to reach this level of quality.I love ""Raiders"", but ""Doom"" have a special place in my heart since 1984.My vote is a 11/10 if possible, if not, 'just' a 10/10 .",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
261,IrisNo11,"""He's no nuts, he's crazy!""",8,11 September 2000,"The second Indiana Jones adventure in the ""Indiana Jones"" saga.  This time, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) unexpectedly winds up in India after a minor conflict with a mob in China.  In India, Indy stumbles upon a village where the people claim that evil has abducted their sacred stone and their children.  Despite the untold dangers that Indy might confront this time around, he agrees to help.  With the help of his young sidekick, Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) and a frantic, nature-hating woman named Willie (Kate Capshaw), Indy must defeat the secretive and deadly Thuggie cult, who sacrifice humans to satisfy their blood-thirsty goddess, and retrieve both the village children and sacred stone.This is my first - and only - Indiana Jones adventure.  And although my brother owns ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Last Crusade"", I never really brought myself to even watch those two.  I find the ""The Temple of Doom"" adventure quite amusing:  ** First of all, you have one frantic character played by Kate Capshaw who totally flips out over the ""disgusting"" side of the great outdoors in India. And of course, she learns that nature is nothing compared to almost having your heart torn out and being thrown into a pit of fire! *lol* 
  ** Not only did I get a real kick out of Willie, but I also got a kick out of Indy's side-kick, Short Round.  Perhaps one of the best parts in the movie is when Short Round saves his hero from a deadly voodoo doll (of him) with a jewel dagger stabbed in it's back as Indy tries to defeat one huge, scary-looking Thuggie.  And of course, here's Short Round pinning down the voodoo doll keeper, throwing endless punches at his face.  And then camera angle turns...there's Indy doing the same thing to the Thuggie. **grin** :)  ** Harrison Ford - one of the greatest actors in Hollywood - looked mighty cute! :)  And as always, our hero finds himself in near-death experiences...such as almost having his heart being torn out by the Thuggie priest Mola Ram (played by Amrish Puri), get washed up by a huge tidal wave of water, etc. etc.Not to mention, ""Indiana Jones And the Temple of Doom"" also features non-stop action and adventure!  Bloody-thirsty worshippers, an ambitious and fearless hero, a frantic woman, and cute little side kick makes this Indy adventure 100% fun w/ non-stop action! :)""He no nuts, he's crazy!"" Short Round says.  Well...at least he's not fearful...or boring! :)",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
262,BigWhiskers,"If you can overlook Capshaws whiny drivel , it's a good movie",4,11 December 2010,I remember when this came out . it had some good action and of course some really nasty gross outs(check out the dinner scene especially) - that scene always grosses me out. the movie does suffer though from it's week female lead - of course we've all ranted on Kate Capshaws whiny performance. If she could have just grown a spine and tried to act instead of overact she may have been decent in this movie. And of course the rumor and probably fact that she was sleeping with Spielberg which resulted in her getting the part. Sorry Kate but you just cant act worth a can of beans. The chase scene in the mine carts and the bridge fight are the best. If say they had recast Karen Allen or for that matter anyone else with a backbone this movie could have been a lot better.,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Watch that clip of family guy and it might be true! She is annoying to listen to. Maybe the writing is to blame for that but the Screaming and whining! Wow! Spielberg married her. Lol. And her daughter is an actress but mediocre. Nepotism in hollywood! Lol.This movie is gross. I've only seen it less than 10 times in my life. As a child, it wasn't that bad. But I'd say the Last Crusade is my favorite, still because Dr. Elsa Schneider was my crush when i was like 8! Lol. The insects, the gross insects they ate at the village! Wow! And a fly landed on it right before kate capshaw ate it. So i guess i give her points for that! I cant eat that for a role! Nope! The room with insects was the grossest. The last time i watched this movie was around age 10. I dont remember it being this bad or gross. Wow!There were dumb parts. The beginning where the chinese(japanese looking man) boss wanted to kill indiana but didnt shoot him?! And on the plane, His pilots could've killed indiana in his sleep but nope! They were like ""let's just let the plane crash!"" Yeah! Dumb! If they wanted them dead, they couldve killed them as they slept. This movie is dumb. And LOUD! So loud! I cant hear what they're saying but the music and noises are SUPER LOUD! I hate movies like this! Have to adjust the volume many times.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
264,alahmed-55673,Better than the 1st film,8,6 July 2020,"This film is so much better than the 1st.
Its more funny and more smooth.
The asian kid made the film better. John relationship with the girl is nice. The flirting between them is nice when they mess/curse each other its also nice.And still Indiana is the baddest smart scientist.in this film he got better with the ladies and got a funny asian kid as a bodyguard.
tbh I got a little bit irritated by the king which is a kid how was hypnotized. But thankfully they didn't show a lot of.Also in the beginning of the scene where Indiana was poisoned and was looking for the cure everyone suddenly got sloppy hands and can't hold the cure. Discernment to be funny I understand but for me I got a little bit irritated.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
265,moviemattb,"Doesn't have the same magic as ""Raiders,"" but it still is a fun adventure movie",8,4 May 2016,"After ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" turned out to be successful as well as consider to be a classic movie, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas teamed up together once again in a sequel that many people considered this to be the darkest of the ""Indiana Jones"" series, and this was the movie that started to created the PG-13 rating due to how dark and violent the movie turned out to be. The movie is rated PG and it is not the kind of PG movie that kids would watch because it is intense for younger audiences. Heck, the movie has kids being turned into slaves as they kept getting whipped by the bad guys, and you really have a guy taking someone's heart out and having the body burned. Some PG movie, huh? If this was rated R, then I honestly don't know what difference will it make. I guess that is up to you for deciding about this. Speaking of the film's rating, the movie takes place a year before ""Raiders"" as Indiana Jones along side with his side-kick Short-Round and Willie Scott (Indy's love interest) as they go from Shanghai to India as they come across of poor villagers as they sent him to retrieve the sacred stones, and rescuing their children as they are being used as slaves at a palace called Pankot. Now its up to Indy to put an end of this nightmare before an evil priest named Mola Ram and his army of thugs get their hands on completing the five stones to rule the world. Everyone is split on this movie, which is the same thing when they were split on the fourth movie. I'll review the fourth one someday, but right now my main focus is this movie I am reviewing. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was bad like how everyone feels but as time goes by as I keep watching this movie it starts to grow on me. However, is it as good as ""Raiders?"" No, not really. Also, it certainly ain't the ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of the series because ""Empire"" is a much better movie than this, and I don't have too much to say about. So here is whats good and bad about the movie: Harrison Ford still hasn't gave a bad performance, and he still manage to be on top of things as he continues to be rough, cool, and looking for fortune and glory. He really is good in this movie as he did with the other ""Indiana Jones"" movies. Amrish Pri is really intimidating in the role as Mola Ram, and something about his looks really does fit to his character. He is definitely a worthy villain, and you can't take your eyes off of him on what he does in this movie. Jonathan Ke Quan plays Short-Round which like Willie Scott everyone has a hard time with him. His accent doesn't bother me, and I honestly really don't find him annoying. I thought he gave a good performance, and really is good sidekick to Indy; he can drive a car, helps out with Indy, and can actually fight like Jackie Chan. Now, for Kate Capshaw, she is not a terrible actress but I do understand how everyone feels when they are annoyed by her character. I'll admit she is pretty useless in this movie, and doesn't do anything much at all except that she whines and complains all the time; there is one part where she punch a bad guy during the mine cart chase, but still she remains to be a damsel in distress throughout the majority of this movie. Her character is not well done, but I can't help but laugh at her when she keeps squealing for Indy and always complain about other things. Her romance with Indy is nothing much to root for, and I will put her character in the ""So bad its good"" category. So bottom line, not really a well-rounded character like Karen Allen did as Marion Ravenwood, but she is funny to watch. The rest of the acting by the cast is finely done. I know Spielberg considered this to be his least favorite, but I thought he did a fine job on directing this movie as well as Lucas' ideas on doing a sequel to a classic adventure movie The special effects by ILM are well done, but there are some parts that are dated. The action scenes with the physical stunt work are really darn good. I do like the mine cart chase, which it feels like that you are on a roller-coaster. John Williams' score is about as good as what he did with his score in the first one. The movie is well paced, and the cinematography is well-filmed. Also, I do like the locations that our main characters go into. I also really do loved how the temple is designed for the movie. By the way, I do like opening musical number ""Anything Goes."" So yeah, I really do enjoy this movie, but its nowhere to be as good ""Raiders."" The story itself is fine for what it is, but its not as intriguing as the first one. I was always invested with the Ark of the Covenant more, than the stones in this movie. All in all, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" doesn't have the same magic as ""Raiders,"" but it still is a fun adventure movie. I am giving it an 8 out of 10.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
266,rebecca-ry,Pretty Poor,5,15 July 2012,"'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' is the second instalment in the Indiana Jones franchise but acts as a prequel to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Compared to that film, the Temple of Doom is pretty poor. The story itself is okay but not excellent. The plot of the film is introduced very well but the plot itself can be really offensive sometimes, particularly when they're in the palace and people are eating monkey brains, eyeballs etc. These parts are really racist and out-dated nowadays.The acting is terrible, Kate Capshaw is awful; she is supposed to play an extremely annoying woman who causes nothing but trouble for Indiana Jones but you cannot help but feel insulted at her character as she's a huge stereotype. Harrison Ford is okay, his performance is not as good in this film as it is in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or in 'The Last Crusade'. The best performance was probably from Jonathan Ke Quan.Overall, this film is the worst Indiana Jones film (apart from the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) and is a bit pointless. The Indiana Jones franchise is overall a really good series of films and provides great family entertainment but this film is the weakest.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
267,raphaklopper,Indiana Jones strikes back!,10,15 September 2013,"Before ""Raiders"", Spielberg already dreamed of making a movie on James Bond style (a beautiful and intelligent man who knows how to fight and conquer women around the world), with the help of George Lucas not only he did something much better and at one point similar. At least until his great (and underrated) sequel that is ""Temple of Doom"".On the first part of the film Spielberg not only realizes his dream of putting something similar to James Bond, but his dream of making a musical. As soon in the first scene of the film, there is a beautiful choreographed musical number with the beautiful Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) as the singer, Indi's new girl in the movie. Also in the first scenes of the movie we see our hero Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in a beautiful white suit with a flower in his chest drinking Martini (almost an American James Bond), but suddenly all gets crooked and a beautiful ass kicking begins in the bar, and Indi ends up escaping and unwittingly with the beautiful and dumb Willie with the help of the small ""Short Round"" (Jonathan Ke Quan) in a wild car chase. Later we already see our badass teacher with the cowboy hat and whip on the waist just leaving another job half done poorly, with their new partner and the irritating Willie complaining about her ""kidnapping"", returning home. But thanks to another huge scene, Indi and his friends end up finding themselves in India (no, not Indi origins story) and finds himself in a situation to find a strange artifact that can save a poor village suffering from drought and famine, but the mission will lead our hero in the bowels of an evil and violent place.Many complain of the movie to be much darker and violent than its predecessor (all thanks to Luke influence of his masterpiece that was ""Empire Strikes Back"", also a sequel), and perhaps due to some dialog flaws it doesn't reach the foots of the masterpiece that was ""Raiders"", but thanks to Spielberg the film keeps all the beautiful rhythm of its predecessor, thanks to Spielberg and his stylish direction that improves as ever.The film follows with a beautiful rhythm (the movie's pacing of time here is far more superior than its predecessor) everything flows perfectly from the spectacular action scenes (including another classic persecution in the trilogy) the script sometimes fails in dialogs but flows with a beautiful, intelligent and humorous narrative. Even with the film at the end gets a touch dark and violent tone, but it is exactly when our hero is coming into the lair of the evil, the film from the start thanks to Willie character has a humorous comic relief (and if you ever wondered how the blonde jokes started, it was thanks to this film).And Spielberg gets a great evolution in his direction giving the film superb action scenes from start to finish, in technical aspects Spielberg's films never disappoint, especially that which shows one of the best teams to build a Hollywood film.While not reaching the feet of his predecessor, ""Temple"" keeps the beautiful rhythm that made "" Raiders"" a masterpiece, bringing the franchise to a new level that may be disturbing to some (but all Spielberg's films always differed much) just gives new strength to our unforgettable hero Indiana Jones and his excellent film.10/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

I've met Jonathan Ke Quan at the Florida Supercon last year in 2018. It was great for Indy to have Short Round as a sidekick. My favorite scene in the Temple of Doom is the mine cart chase scene. It's like Donkey Kong and Diddy riding the mine cart.When I watched this while I was growing up, I glued on to the screen for the action. In behind the scenes, I noticed that Harrison had to workout.

271,cutter-12,True Adventure,9,19 April 1999,"Karen Allen in the first film was the tomboy cum strongwilled woman whom Indy fell for years before.  Allison Doody in the third film was the treacherous nazi femme fatale with divided loyalties.  Kate Capshaw in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is the ultimate damsel in distress, the pampered and shallow showgirl who is thrust into a world far away from the material comforts she enjoys as an exiled American Singer in 1930's Shanghai.  From the opening Busby Berkeley-like production number (brilliant in its glittering tribute to Ginger Rogers/Ruby Keeler pictures of the mid thirties) it is obvious her character is going to be the screaming mimi designed to get on the audiences as well as Indy's nerves. People miss the point that every nuance of her performance is intentional and not a result of any bad acting on the behalf of Miss Capshaw.  That all said, this is easily the best installment of The Indiana Jones Trilogy, the only one that attempts pure 1930's adventure with elements from a host of 1930's films set in exotic locales and borrowing its plot mostly from the greatest adventure film ever made, 1939's ""Gunga Din"".  The dark and mystical nature of this film's story makes it a welcome change from the other two film's heavy biblical quests. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was original and magnificent in that regard but a return to that territory in ""Last Crusade"" left the filmmakers reaching.

273,walsh-22,prefer this one to the first movie,10,23 May 2007,"I don't understand why people say this film is not as good as Raiders and last Crusade, they are out of their minds. For one thing, the film is jam packed with amazing stunts in particular when Indy, Willy and Short Round realise there is no one flying the plane and they are going to crash and they end up falling out of the plane in an inflatable boat and they go over cliffs. The Stunt men definitely deserved recognition for putting their lives in jeopardy to carry out these awe inspiring stunts that I wouldn't have the courage to do.The magic is still in the film, as I have mentioned the stunts are out of this world, there is still romance and action that keeps the audience gripped. The heroine Willy (Kate Capshaw) is different from Marion in the first film as she is a night club singer who is pampered and spoilt. I love the chemistry between her and Indy, they sizzle together. They have a type of love/hate relationship going on.Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) is very funny and has me in floods of laughter, he has some of the best lines. He looks up to Indy and they have a father/son relationship which is sweet to watch.

274,Michael Kenmore,"Failure of the film in uneven, schizophrenic tone",5,18 May 2008,"I decided to write a comment on this film for two reasons: I very distinctly remember this movie when my father took me and my younger brother to see the movie in the darkened screening room at the semi-rundown first-run theatre when I was five years old -- it's the first movie I vividly remember seeing -- and the recent viewing on DVD rental left a bitter taste as a near-disaster film in terms of weirdly uneven tone that mark it as the black sheep of the Indiana Jones franchise.It's not the dark elements of the movie that bother me. That's really fine with me. It's the strange, shrill and manic tone of the film that didn't strike the right chord with me in terms of aesthetic movie experience. I'm sure Mr. Spielberg understands this from the point of view of the dismayed audience, hence why he consider the film not very good in spite of association with George Lucas in production, which is pretty humble for an A-list director. The writing, production design and acting, except for the irritating Kate Capshaw, is good, with visual effects (despite obvious camp-art fakery) the best merit of the movie.Alternating between physical comedy and dark elements make for a jarringly uneven film leave me feeling uneasy as though I've hitched on the roller-coaster ride and wanted to get off while it's ongoing. There is a bit of unintentional racial stereotype element in the film, notably the infamous gross-out dinner sequence and voodoo that do not have any basis in reality. It's a fictional adventure movie with racist stereotypes put forth from Lucas' vivid imagination in storytelling. I'm sure George Lucas had subconsciously released the conceived racist stereotypes because he grew up watching the uncensored and unabashedly racist cartoon shorts released by Walt Disney Studio, Warner Bros and MGM. (Exhibit A: Jar-Jar in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace)That's not to say it's better to be uptight with political correct thought and attitude. I hate PC. But I understood criticism that The Temple of Doom is perhaps racist by denigrating the culture and race to condense into the adventure yarn. There's The Adventures of Tintin with racist elements as well and yet I still enjoy the classic comics by overlooking the controversial element as long as the story is involving.And the biggest problem, of course, is unnecessary gore. I don't remember my reaction or for that matter my father's reaction when we saw the movie in the screening, but I understand how incredulous the parents felt when they were duped into bringing children to see a PG-rated Indiana Jones popcorn movie only to be appalled by the dark and horrific brutality. Steve Spielberg wasn't a father at that time yet, but he wised up as soon as he became a father to understand and empathize with the point of view of dismayed and concerned parents. I give Spielberg a credit for the creation of a PG-13 category after the debacle of violent and frightening PG movies (this and Gremlin) to alleviate parental concern. I don't understand why this movie isn't re-submitted for re-rating, but I'm sure presently strict MPAA will probably give it an R instead of a PG-13 to the dismay of Spielberg, Lucas and co.It's a pity The Temple of Doom isn't artistically a good movie, despite technical achievements that won the film an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. I like dark films but this isn't one of them because of nonsensical story and intentionally absurd tone. Despite the valiant attempt to be as dark as can be on Lucas' suggestion, the film doesn't feel right at all. It is the mistaken decision to impose overall tone that completely undermine the enjoyment of the film, leaving the viewers disappointed. They would ask ""why is this movie isn't as good as that first movie?"" and they already know the answer.I watched the closing credit with intent to catch the name of a promising future director: David Fincher, co-credited with matte photography when he was a (very) young man.

276,scott-sw,Indy still impressive here,8,25 January 2008,"While I rank Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as the weakest in the series, it still packs a great punch as a great action and adventure movie. We pick up in China where Indy is negotiating for a diamond in exchange for the ashes of an old dead Oriental leader to a ruthless Gangster, Lao Che. There, he meets Willy (Kate Capshaw), a night dancer. After a chase, a fight, and poisoning, he barely escapes with her and makes his way to the local airport. They escape with the aid of Short Round (Ke Hu Quan), a young Chinese boy who drives them to the airport. He, Willie and Shortie are able to escape on a plane. Little do they known that Lao Che owns the plane. The pilots sneak off just before dumping the fuel. They escape only as Indiana Jones can ... on an inflatable raft. As they slide down the mountains into the river, they find themselves in India. Coming to a village, they find it is stripped of its vegetation and children. The leaders believe the misfortune is caused by the loss of the sacred stone. Indy thinks someone at the Pankot Palace believes their stone to be lost Shankara Stones, magical ones that were given from the Hindu God, Shiva. He thinks someone has resurrected the old Thugee cult which has led to the disappearance of the stone and the village children. As Dr. Jones and his friends search the castle, they accidentally stumble on a Thugee ritual. The Shankara Stones are there. The Thugee Priest, Mola Ram has found three of them, and uses the children as slave labor to find the other two stones. His hope is that Kali, the Thugee Goddess, will gain power to cast down the God of the Jews, Muslims, and Christians. Indy, Shortie, and Willie are all captured then must escape. This leads to spectacular stunts, well-paced fights, and unrelenting action in the tradition of old Saturday morning serials. I did find a few flaws with the movie. It is darker and more violent than its predecessor. This black eye led to the formation of the PG-13 rating. It is also stagnant, staying in one location as opposed to traversing more continents. It also pushes the envelope of dopey side-kicks. Short Round is one of those second bananas that you might love and hate. As a kid, he does have charm, wit, and humor ... something all side-kicks need. He is also an Achillie Heal, often triggering traps and stumbling around. He can fight too well, he is too smart, and is very convenient. The downside is that he is a kid and was used solely for the purpose of getting kids to this movie. A couple of scenes also really defy the odds. The raft out of the plane scene (which was actually done by stunt men), while entertaining seemed implausible. The other when their mine car jumped the chasm also strained believability. Finally, this one does not have the magic awe of the Ark of the Covenenat or the Holy Grail. It is not mysterious and does not appeal to the wonder of an audience. It does appeal, though, to tension. The scenes are grafted wondrously to keep your attention, and keep you on the edge of your seat. We cringe seeing Indy, Shortie and Willie barely escape death numerous times ... an in inventive ways. I liked the mine car chase because of the variation. Spielberg not only used the cars behind each other, but with them side-to-side, with one above the other, and in other variations. The bridge scene was also enjoyable, frightening, and believable for someone with no options. Some people did not like Kate Capshaw in this one. I thought she did well. She was the ditsy blonde who screamed and kicked. She was the one needed in the bug chamber because Marian would have reached in there. She also had the sex appeal needed for the role. Finally, I liked the villain in this one a lot better. In Raiders, except for Toht, the villains were nothing more than cardboard cutouts. Belloq was nothing more than a nemesis or adversary instead of a true vicious villain. Then, you hated the Nazies simply because they were Nazis. Mola Rom, on the other hand, was someone Indy chose to engage. He was evil. He exuded it. He made it real, and frightening. And the idea that the Thugee Cult was a real cult at one time is also frightening. In any case, this one should not be overlooked. It's not the best of Indy, but it is far from being bad.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

278,gottogorunning,Great Action!,8,13 August 2005,"This movie was shown on Swedish TV3 last night, and although I don't like the quantity of commercials that channel like to rip up a movie with, I thought I wanted to see this movie because I've been very much into Hinduism lately and I remember that this movie was set in a Kali temple. Last time I saw it was '92 or something, and I also remember getting really frightened by some scenes, but now when I've been forged with movies like Bad Taste and Urotsukidoji, I thought I was ready to see this movie again. Right I was! As always in a Spielberg movie, there has to be a girl for the hero alongside all the action. I thought she could've been cut out of the script, all she does is scream when she gets frightened (and that's quite often, given that the major part of this movie is set in India where there's a lot of scary stuff in the eyes of an American girl) and complains about how awful everything is in India since she's used to living at hotels and drinking champagne in limousines and so on.The action itself is FUN! Not in the Chuck Norris/Steven Segall sense, where the hero is taking out so many enemies it becomes laughable, but in the sense that there is a lot of innovative ways that the hero uses environment and equipment to take out enemies or defend himself.Also, I am pleased to state that there are no socio-religious errors in the Hindu parts of the movie, Spielberg for once seems to have gotten all the facts right! I give this movie 8 out of 10, and I think that's fair given that I write this comment in 2002 and some of the visual effects leave a lot to wish.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

280,christophershobris,Is it that Good?,7,10 November 2018,"Of all the Steven Spielberg films this is to me by far the weirdest one he's ever done. But does weird equal good? Well, let's get this out of the way...their is no logic in this film, so you can just throw that out the window. People thought Crystal Skull was unrealistic (?)...think again. Spielberg lets us know pretty much right out of the gate what kind of movie we're dealing with here. George Lucas (the storywriter) went in such a humorous direction with the story it almost came across as a comedy. With the more comedic approach this made the film very unique in the feeling of it compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark which was darker and more serious, and The Last Crusade which borrows a lot of the elements from Raiders to give it a similar tone and feel to it. Indiana Jones himself is written in a more comedic way, almost to the point where you can't take him seriously, but not quite, Harrison Ford makes the characters balanced and doesn't make Indy come across as cartoony. As for the supporting characters...oh my god. These supporting characters make me want to pull my hair out. Willie played by Kate Capshaw is such a major step down from Marion. Yes, she was a damsel in distress, but she was a badass while she was. Here, she is over-the-top just for the sake of it. I don't blame Capshaw because she's just acting the way the director tells her to so, Spielberg, what the heck? You given us such beautiful characters like E.T. and Elliott. Then you give us this. Why? Then there is Short Round. Look, I understand there is a lot of people who like this character but...I just can't. His voice is like nails on a chalkboard, the actor who portrays him just isn't a good actor. He's definitely more important than Willie and isn't excruciatingly annoying but he does get under my skin. I know it seems I'm bashing the film more than I intended to. What do I like about this film? The villain. Unlike Willie, he is over-the-top in all the right ways. Roshan Seth does a great job with his character he makes this film enjoyable. The other thing, Harrison Ford's performance, like I said before, he gives a rather complex performance as Indy compared to Raiders. And lastly, the mine cart chase scene, beautifully choreographed, masterfully suspenseful, and downright entertaining. These three things gives this film a solid 7/10. Nowhere near as bad as Crystal, but comfortably falls in third place behind Raiders and Crusade for me. So is this film really that good? It's good, but not great.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
281,I_Love_Spielberg,"May be the weakest, but it still delivers.",8,8 May 2008,"When I first saw this movie, I was scared of it. It was because of the sacrificial scene where Mola Ram rips a sacrificial victim's still beating heart out of his chest. What scared me about it was that it was where the victim actually saw his own heart in the guy's hand and he actually saw his own chest wound heal. Then when they lowered him down into the ""hot pit,"" and when he and his own heart combust in flames, that's where I just lost it. I was basically traumatized from it. I couldn't watch it again.But what I did like was some of the humor between Indiana Jones, Willie Scott, and Short Round. They did a good job with it. The action sequences were pretty good as well, even though some of them involved torture and black magic (the voodoo doll I have to admit is pretty freaky). Still, the one that was etched in all of our minds is the sacrificial scene. You can't get any scarier than that. Spielberg once again proves that he can make a horror movie.But, even though it's the weakest and some of it won't appeal to you, don't let it spoil your enjoyment of the film. Enjoy it for what it is, regardless of the scares. You might enjoy it and you might not enjoy it. I personally like it better than I did when I first saw it. It's still delivers.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
282,Marx_Bros_Fan86,OK adventure film,6,14 March 2007,"George Lucas and Steven Spielberg take Indiana Jones on a much darker adventure in the sequel to the smash hit Raiders of the Lost Ark. This film seems to be the least popular entry in the series. Its efforts to top Raiders are apparent in the overuse of gross out scenes with bugs instead of snakes, as well as a few over-the-top (but still fun) action scenes.Doom has exciting action scenes, and Amrish Puri is an entertaining (if a bit one dimensional) bad guy. No one can make the word ""welcome"" sound more evil! Possibly the best parts of Doom were the mine cart chase and the final rope bridge scene. The mine cart chase was done so well in terms of staging, lighting, etc. that you don't even stop and think ""why on earth did these people bother to build a roller-coaster?"" I would say the rope bridge scene is arguably better than Raider's finale because Jones actually defeats the bad guys, whereas in Raiders the bad guys would have killed themselves with or without Indy. On a technical level this film is top notch, I would not expect less from Spielberg or Lucas. Ford injured his back while filming and Spielberg was forced to work with his stunt doubles for a few weeks (possibly months). After Ford recovered, Spielberg had to go back and film close-ups for the scene where Jones fights Pat Roach, the big guy in the temple. I have to say Spielberg edited this sequence perfectly, as there were no scenes where I could tell Indiana Jones was actually Vic Armstrong, Harrison's stunt double. The sets were also just as amazing if not better than Raiders' sets; the big Temple Chamber was the most impressive set in the movie, and possibly the entire series. You would never guess that Pankot palace was just a matte painting either.The film begins with an excellent action sequence in a nightclub in Shanghai, but from there the film's flaws start to appear. Most of the characters in this film are just not particularly likable or interesting. We are introduced to Jones' new girlfriend, Willie Scott (played by Spielberg's future wife Kate Capshaw). Scott is a spoiled brat, not funny or charming like Marion in Raiders. Her constant complaining makes you want to press the mute button on the remote control. I never thought the Indy from Raiders would like this kind of woman. The romance in this movie feels forced. Despite all of Willie's whining, there are a few genuinely funny moments, like the homage to the scene in Raiders when Indy shoots the Egyptian guy with the big sword. Only this time, when Indy reaches for his gun he remembers he lost it in China, making for a very funny awkward moment.Then we have Jones' kid sidekick Short Round. I don't think Shorty is in the movie other than to lighten the mood. He only has a bunch of ""oh isn't he cute"" scenes. There is sentimentality between Indy and Shorty that feels forced, like the romance with Willie. I think the film makers were uncomfortable with the darkness of the film so they wanted to inject more humor. I'd be interested to know if the character of Shorty was Spielberg's idea. Now normally it is OK to have a character like this, as long as there are interesting characters to make up for them. Jones had interesting relationships with Belloq and Marion in Raiders, and with his father in Last Crusade, but sadly there is nothing like that in Doom. One could argue that Indy's character goes from a selfish treasure hunter to a more noble hero, but unfortunately the transition wasn't really essential to the plot, nor was there a discernible moment of transition. There was never any point where I thought Indy would just take the stones for himself and leave the slave children with the evil cult. The biggest problem for me was that the plot was not quite involving enough, largely due to a weak macguffin. Indy embarks on a quest to find the magic Sankara stones and free children who have been enslaved by the Thuggee cult. Unfortunately we never find out what these stones can actually do (so they glow, big deal). We have to take Mola Ram's word that these stones will empower the cult to rule the world. They are overshadowed by the black magic and the child slaves so they sort of get lost in the mix of things. The plot is progressed by coincidences and accidents. For example, Jones doesn't have to uncover any clues to lead him to the stones (except for a vague inscription on a wall), he just stumbles upon them when he accidentally finds a secret passage. I know I'll come off as a monster, but freeing children is just not a very interesting thing for someone like Indiana Jones to do. It comes off as a cheap technique to get the audience to root for the good guys. I think the writers felt they needed to give him a more moral objective that would really make the audience feel satisfied, because the stones certainly wouldn't do that by themselves.Incidentally this film is filled with stereotypes and inaccuracies that have been perpetuated since Gunga Din. Since when have Voodoo dolls been a part of Hinduism? All of the Indiana Jones films are filled with stereotypes but Doom takes the cake in the ""ignorance"" category. Even the good Indians are somewhat childlike and primitive in their belief that Indiana Jones was sent by their god to save them. In conclusion, Temple of Doom is an entertaining action film, but it does not stand out as a great accomplishment.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
283,tstudstrup,"Childish, lame humor, bad story and bad special effects.",1,21 August 2018,"This movie has not aged well. The temple of doom is almost as bad as Kingdom of the crystal scull. Both movies are written by George Lucas so that explains why they both suck. 
Unlike the hysterical american parents in the 1980's (who by bitching about the violence helped create the awful PG13 rating) I have no problem with the said violence in the movie. And that violence is really just that one scene with the heart and the man bing burned alive which are lousy special effects and not nearly as brutal as the nazis being killed at the end of the first movieWhat I do have a problem with is the childish tone of the film, where every situation has to be made comical by by the annoying Willie Scott played by the unattractive ugly Kate Capshaw. Luckily she stopped acting a few years afte,r as she didnt have to work, being married to the very rich Spielberg. And the equally annoying Short Round played by Jonathan Ke Quan. And he's not the only annoying kid in this movie. There is also the little maharaja played by Raj Singh. And all of the child slaves. Too many annoying kids in one movie.
 
Despite this movie, having a reputation as being this franchises version of The Empire strikes back and the darkest movie, it comes off as silly and boring. 
The entire opening sequence in the nightclub is annoying and lame comedy unlike the powerful opening in the original movie. The movie never really gets good. The bridge scene is the only scene worth watching in the entire movie. The special effects are terrible even for 1984. From horrible obvious matte paintings in several scenes to the most fake looking plane crash I have ever seen to the fake looking scene of a heart litterally ripped from a mans chest to obvious puppets and miniatures in the miniwaggon chase scenes, to a dummy standing in for Ford in a fight scene, this movie comes off as cheap despite a budget of 28 million dollars. Unlike the first much superior and much more expensive looking movie, that had a much smaller budget, almost the entire film was shot in California despite the story taking place in India. The Terminator from the same year had, for the most part, better special effects despite a budget of only 6 million dollars. Its like Spielberg and Lucas were trying to save money on the sequel, by making such shitty special effects. The special effects of the original movie were much better and more creatively made. Its like they just didnt care in the sequel. I get that this movie is 34 years old and it was long before CGI, but Ive always preferred practical effects. However CGI, while not making the movie better, would have at least made the actionscenes and the violence more convincing. However too much CGI can be a bad thing, which the awful fourth movie proves in spades. For kids being born in the 90's or around 2000, long after this movie came out it will look like the utter shit that it is. To them I can only say: do not watch this. People who used to love this movie and see it on bluray on a 4K tv, for the first time, will hate it just as much, because the UHD definition makes the speical effects look so bad. The only reason I'm even giving this crap one star, is because 0 stars are not possible on imdb.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
284,matlefebvre20,Almost an insult,5,8 May 2006,"While ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a thrilling well-directed masterpiece, ""Temple of Doom"" feels just like a very ordinary sequel. Just like if it was necessary to show Indiana Jones once more, no matter what's inside.Simply said, ""Temple of Doom"" is a big miss and a big mess. Director Steven Spielberg tries to deliver some good stunts and it works well, but that's almost the only thing that works. However, even the stunts, action sequences and special effects don't always work. So when the main piece doesn't work, it's clearly evident that the rest won't follow.The main problem is the overabundance of freaky bugs, corpses and other things that provokes gross from the audience. It's totally unnecessary and it's not what we want to see. Those things should be in a horror film, not in an adventure film. And those things even interfere onto some moments which could be interesting. The main example is the dinner scene inside the palace. While Indiana Jones, the British general and the Prime Minister chat about the primordial elements of Jones' mission, we have to contemplate the menu: little black snakes coming off from a bigger snake's body, fresh living cockroaches, eyeball soup and monkey brain for dessert. First of all, frankly, would all that stuff be found inside a luxurious maharajah palace? Secondly, it distracts the viewer from the important conversation between Jones and the minister.However, if you find (like me) that the movie is bad, don't blame it on Harrison Ford. Ford and Indiana Jones are two inseparable beings and the actor plays the character with great mastery, emotion and coolness. The lady in distress this time is Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), but she just doesn't belong into an Indy movie. And was it necessary for Jones to have a little Chinese sidekick? ""Of course! It wouldn't be a good movie if not!""For all of its bad characters, unnecessary freaks and highlighted but too easily needed action parts, ""Temple of Doom"" deserves my lowest regards inside the Indiana Jones trilogy.Rankings: Best: Raiders of the Lost Ark 2nd Best: Indiana Jones and the Lost Crusade Worst: INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

The evil villain behind this is none other than the great Amrish Puri ji who plays his part to perfection (His big eyes and voice help in his portrayal of Mola Ram)This movie had additional thrills and fast paced scenes than the original one. Just because of the success of the first one, Spielberg wanted to fulfill the expectations of Indiana Jones lovers by giving them everything extra. But this is were it lacks the soul which the first movie had. But one thing I will mention, the success of Indiana Jones series lies in the combination of great thrills and comic timings of the actors especially Ford .

Well this movie was a little bit different than Raiders. Indiana in the first film would stop at nothing to get the ark and it showed him as a dare taker, someone who has his choices but must face the facts. In Doom, Indiana seems like a version of James Bond in the jungle. Take the first scene for example, spoilers: Indi is clad in a tuxedo in a small bar club. He takes ransom for a valuable jewel from some evil mafia men and they poison his drink, sounds familiar. Indi must defeat the men in a club brawl fight for the antidote and save the stone while he is dodging bullets behind a gong, picking up a singer, and falling into his car which is being driven by a ten year old partner. Sounds to me like Spielberg and Lucas needed some more inspiration. We soon find Indi needing to find some sacred stone for this old tribe who have lost all their children. No ancient treasure in sight...huh! We soon find ourselves being driven into an ancient cult of sacrifice and blood, that's not Indiana Jones!So we have him chasing after stones, being possessed, free children slaves from voodoo and rock mining, fighting over a rope bridge (the best part of the whole show), and trying to find his way back home. I enjoyed myself to this movie as the creators tried to reuse famous scenes from the first film, like the snake pit. They transformed the infamous snake pit scene into this new and dark hallway of bugs scene! I give this film a 7 out of 10.

It does have some very exciting moments, and some fantastic adventure scenes, but the theme is very dark, and very foreboding. Steven Spielberg uses some of the ideas from the first film, but has to let the film settle to its own heights and its depths of gloom.

Next spot is India, and Indy learns of a mysterious cult of the macabre that has been resurrected and is tormenting the nearby villagers, forcing the children of the villages to work under inhumane conditions to find some glowing stones that are supposed to give the owners supreme power and domination over the other countries of the world.

When it came to The Temple of Doom, George Lucas said he intended to make the film a lot darker than the original, in a similar way to how The Empire Strikes Back was the dark second installment in the Star Wars series. Well, he certainly succeeded in making it dark! The Temple of Doom was the first Indy film I saw, and even with no knowledge of the series, its dark tone really struck me as too much for its own good. It's just too bone-chilling and macabre. Even some of the jokes weren't as funny because of the film's overall tone (like the disgusting dinner, for instance).This doesn't mean The Temple of Doom is completely serious. It has its moments of humour, too, mostly provided by the ""Indy girl"", Willie Scott. Although Marion Ravenwood is certainly the ultimate Indy girl, Willie is a lot of fun. She's an outrageous parody of the traditional ""damsel in distress"", and just provides a lot of fun comic relief.As for Indy's sidekick, Short Round, I loved the kid! Seriously, at ten, he was more help to Indy than Mutt Williams was in Indy 4! Favourite line? ""I'm very little! You cheat very big!"" The Temple of Doom is really scary/creepy at times. Those of you who've seen the movie know what I mean.The film certainly has a lot of outlandish chases, stunts, and action. (The mine cart chase is just plain amazing!)

292,CalDexter,Temple Of Doom is an action packed Blockbuster!,10,17 June 2008,"I remember seeing this at the cinema when i was eight years old. I had not even seen Raiders Of The Lost Ark, i missed that at the cinema which was a shame. But seeing Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom in the cinema was a childhood pleasure that i will remember until the day i die. This film is amazing, even watching this on DVD doesn't quite capture its true entertainment value where it really belongs-the cinema. As I've stated in my review for Raiders, they should have re-released the Indiana Jones Trilogy worldwide just like George Lucas did with Star Wars in 1997. It would have made seeing the later fourth film even more mouth watering.Temple Of Doom has been accused of being 'very dark'. I'm sorry but so was Raiders Of The Lost Ark. ALL the Indiana Jones films have a true element of Darkness running through them. Raiders had the scene where Marion Ravenwood falls into a lair tomb of rotting corpses with snakes coming out of their mouths and The Last Crusade has Elisa Schneider looking on in horror as German Nazis burn every book they can that does not pertain to their Idealogy. Temple Of Doom also has a tremendous sense of humour that has you laughing at the disturbing bits-witness the terror in Indy's face as hes about to be stabbed and squashed by that sinking cave ceiling (one of this films funniest moments) You want to complain about the gore? So was the climax of Raiders! Certain bits of Last Crusade weren't for the faint hearted either. Why don't the Doom merchants (ho ho) just chill out and enjoy this masterpiece? Harrison Ford is fantastic in this. Hes also much more pumped up here in muscle than he was in Raiders. I always loved it how he had that long fight with the huge Thugee supervisor on that Rock conveyor belt, and ended up battered and bruised, shirt torn and looking 100% heroic in the process. When he shouts at Mola Ram (an excellent performance from Amirish Puri) to let Willie and Short Round go, he looks every inch the action hero. The set pieces in this film look real and are absolutely convincing to this day, The Temple Of Doom itself is also one of the most impressive cinematic studio locations i have ever seen.Special mention must go to John Williams for another memorable score. Temple Of Doom also has its own authentic theme just like Raiders and Last Crusade (with Indy's theme tune present in all three films) and its all about fun and adventure. The music playing throughout the Mine cart chase and the suspension bridge helps to thrill the audience even more.

293,Hotwok2013,A spectacular first fifteen minutes.,8,12 June 2013,"At bottom line, in my opinion, the first duty of any movie is to entertain. Director Steven Spielberg, obviously, thought so too. ""Indiana Jones & The Temple Of Doom"" is by no means a perfect movie but it does start with a hell of a bang. Spielberg's homage to Busby Berkeley with the ""Anything Goes"" dance sequence is as entertaining a start to a movie as you will ever see. To anyone that loves movies, you can tell from watching any of his movies that Mr. Spielberg loved the escapist entertainment he got from his boyhood of watching endless hours of movies. It was this, more than anything else, that motivated him to want to become a film director. By his own admission, there are failures in IJATTOD such as the banquet at Pankot Palace. The kids & plenty of adults found the menu of chilled monkey brains etc. off-putting to say the least. The performance of leading lady Kate Capshaw, whom Mr. Spielberg later married, was a bit over-the-top & somewhat irritating. The action which later takes place in the temple of doom itself, bathed in a red fiery light, is also somewhat dark, gloomy & depressing. This film is far from dull but of the trilogy of Indiana Jones movies, this one definitely takes third place.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

They're all fine, but they're not characters I would like to get involved with or be around with.With all apologies to Ms. Capshaw, who obviously appealed strongly to the director, she's no Karen Allen. Any chemistry between her and Ford is accidental and incidental. As a love interest, she's a bust. Her role is therefore to scream a lot, get into trouble from which she needs to be rescued, and annoy the hell out of viewers who are tired of this sort of comedic damsel in distress act. It might be acceptable if it was more amusing and less tedious.However, there are some positive aspects to the film that I enjoy. The set design, art direction, special effects, and sound effects inside this underground Hades are among the most impressive achievements in the film. The mine cart scene is so exhilarating and exciting. Also, Mola Ram is intimidating and serves as a great villain due to his voodoo magic, and his his presence. ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" makes no apologies for being exactly what it is: Exhilarating, manic, wildly imaginative escapism. A few of the new characters I couldn't handle, but as is, it's a great movie. It has some great action, and a great villain.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
295,Raleon,More entertaining at least,7,20 August 2003,"I never found Raiders of the Lost Ark very good. It wasn't very entertaining for me and the acting was bad. everyone seemed to shout and overact with the exception of John Rys-Davies.    This one was more enjoyable from an entertainment perspective, and the acting is much better, but the adventure isn't as good and the sound of a woman screaming at the top of her lungs every five minutes is just too irritating for one to take. But still, Indiana Jones is still able to combine a fantasy-like adventure with a belief we hold to be true. Where most search for something made up, the makers of the series search for something said to be real. This is really the only good thing the series has to offer anyway.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
296,cordaro9418,A prequel sequel? Maybe... huh?,6,14 September 2008,"Is there really a need to review it? I mean after all, it wasn't nearly as interesting or compelling as the original or the sequels.Sure the supernatural aspect of pulling a beating heart out is cool, but not quite like the wrath of God tearing ass on a Nazi platoon.Indy didn't need a sidekick in the form of Batman's Asian 'Robin', nor the typical screaming broad (Sorry Mrs. Spielberg)...While the film's opening gave a glimmer of retro type adventure films of the Saturday matinée variety... it didn't quite happen.Well, it's a prequel, so maybe just categorize it under the 'Adventures of Young Indiana Jones' and leave it on the same shelf.Kinda' like Superman III & IV (ask Warner Bros.), just pretend it didn't happen and move on the the next sequel...

This should be titled ""Indiana Jones Listens to Kate Capshaw Screaming"". Oh. My. God. I HATED this movie. I just could not stand another minute of her screaming.

299,Funky A,The weakest Indiana Jones movie...,7,12 April 2000,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the weakest of the Indiana Jones. It is still an entertaining movie, but never tries to impress us. Unlike the original Indiana Jones, which is THE adventure movie you should see in your life, this one doesn't try to be wonderful. Instead, you almost feel they tried to make it a bit of a horror movie(this is the most gory and graphic in the trilogy) but they left the thrills somewhere else... This is not a bad movie, but it's pretty disappointing.71%, it's still a fun movie, but not nearly as good as the two others...",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
300,annmason1,Pass,1,29 October 2005,"Can there be a more irritating movie? What's with Kate Capshaw? She keeps claiming she wants to be regarded as more than Mrs. Spielberg (which is certainly something she got out of this movie) but this mess certainly disproves her aspirations. One can only conclude that Steven, helplessly in love, was forced to cover her lack of talent with the gravy of screaming...like rotten meat.Gee, that sounded harsh. But I had not seen this film in years and decided it couldn't have been as awful as I remembered. I was wrong. Capshaw was the icing on a lousy cake that substituted vulgarity for plot and denigrated the actors who actually knew better.Minus Zero.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
301,TimBoHannon,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Abuse,3,4 May 2009,"I had heard a lot of distressing reports of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and had been warned not to see it. I love ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and thoroughly enjoyed ""The Last Crusade,"" but it was ""Temple of Doom's"" PG rating that attracted me. There was no PG-13 rating then, yet even by today's standards it should be rated R. The last thirty minutes contain great action even by the standards of directing legend Steven Spielberg, but there is no suspension of disbelief. Far too much damage has been done by that time.It is structured in four segments: neat and fun; irritating and boring; reviling and sick; and irrelevant. It is essentially half-trash, half-silver. The affair would be better if all the silver existed in one place, but most of it arrives after the movie has crossed the point of no return. Even without the lofty standards placed by ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is a bad movie.The opening Shanghai club fight and street chase introduce us to Indiana's (Harrison Ford) partners for the movie: Chinese youth Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) and club dancer and singer Willie Scott, the character who falls short. Another reason for their inclusion is pace. Once the movie shifts to its main location of India, there is no action for more than an hour.At this point, they learn from the elder of a nearby village that a long-extinct occult may have been revived by the residents of a nearby palace. Indy's curiosity is roused when he realizes that a legendary stone may be there. Since he, Willie and Short Round need to visit there anyway, Indy decides to investigate.""Raiders of the Lost Ark's"" Marion Ravenwood shared most of Indiana's good qualities: bravery, resourcefulness, wit, toughness, and so on. Her mixture of happiness and disdain at seeing Indiana, followed by her defiance towards the Nazi task force characterize her before story shifts to its main destination. Willie made me want to throw a brick through the screen, but then I remembered that I could not kill her by doing that. Her main function is to scream, whine about every little inconvenience and scream more. Granted, I would probably be complaining if I was in that situation, but not about *everything.* I certainly would not be as loud and incessant as she.Willie is not the biggest problem, especially since her behavior is far more palatable once the trio enters the Temple of Doom. It is the first 25 minutes of that second hour that behead the movie. It dives headlong into revolting territory. The most famous instance comes first. Occult leader Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) cleanly removes the heart of a human sacrifice victim. Still alive, he is lowered into the pit while begging Shiva for deliverance. My ability to suspend disbelief was not merely broken when I saw that; it was shattered like car window glass. My desire to be entertained by the movie was not far behind.The problem grows worse once the movie introduces forced child labor complete with sadistic slave-drivers and their scourge-whips. Spielberg does not merely gloss over this. We see the guards punish children no more than ten for tripping or walking too slowly. That is not all. Upon Indy's capture, he is forced to drink blood that will supposedly hypnotize him. If any suspension of disbelief remained by then, it would have been nuked. This comes complete with a graphic whipping scene that goes *way* too far for a PG rating. Scabbed lines on Indiana's back and his bloody shirt are later visible. Finally, an Indiana voodoo doll is stabbed by another hypnotized child (Raj Singh). Children saw this movie in theaters! Spielberg and writer George Lucas decided to include all of the distasteful material. They should have taken it all the way. Mola Ram dies while being pulled apart by competing crocodiles, but the visuals are not nearly graphic enough to satisfy. ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" stretches itself way too far to get away with a using a neutered portrayal here. When a character is the most evil man on the planet, he needs to have the most gruesome and degrading death in the movie, end of discussion.Lucas wanted a darker feel after the success of ""The Empire Strikes Back."" The most upsetting scene in that movie is Darth Vader's force strangulation. That would be so mild in ""Temple of Doom"" that it would pass without notice. Actually, this is the only Indiana Jones movie to date where the signature action is decisive. The Holy Grail, the Ark, and the Crystal Skull took care of themselves. This movie's victory is most complete. John Williams' theme combined with the cheering of the villagers could have made for a rousing conclusion. I no longer cared. With so many poor decisions in its making, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" cannot rate higher than a three of ten.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
302,drmuhammedsamiduru,It's definitely better than the first movie.,7,14 June 2020,"This movie is definitely much better than the first movie. This movie completely met my waits in the first movie. We opened the first movie to watch an adventure movie. The first movie is like the World War II movie you know. The first movie was no different from a war movie that worsened Hitler and glorified America. This movie was a movie that gave us what we wanted from the first movie.

303,shhimundercoverdamnit,"Mola Ram, prepare to meet Kali... in Hell!",7,11 February 2008,"The self described- darkest of the series finds Indiana Jones in India uncovering a sinister scheme by the Thuggees: an evil cult who worship the goddess Kali with human sacrifices and have enslaved a remote villages children in a fortress-like mine.Temple of Doom could have easily just been a sort of rehash of Raiders, but Spielberg and Lucas choose instead to make a whole different film. In essence, Temple of Doom is really much more of a horror film, and it seems to be much more of a challenging movie than any of the other two of the series.The first thing that strikes me personally, about the film is the fact that it somehow is rated PG. This is a film, which features a supernatural ritual of removing a person?s heart, people being lowered into a pit of lava, weird voodoo dolls, etc. Literally, this film really freaks the hell out of me. Especially, the whole sequence where Indy is forced to drink the ""blood of Kali Ma"", and he basically becomes one of them.One main thing, I liked about the film, is that it had an entertaining opening, with Indiana Jones in a Shanghai nightclub attempting to trade the remains of Nurhaci for a large diamond with a gangster named Lao Che. It was quite a thrill. The bridge scene at the end is just a classic.However, I really just cannot stand Kate Capshaw in this film, as the reluctant night club singer, Willie Scott. ?The biggest trouble with her is the noise.? I think that would be an under-statement, all she does throughout the whole film is scream and whine. One sure way, to gain a headache.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
304,Gerardrobertson61,Not the greatest sequel,5,12 April 2014,"It,s been close to 30 years since I last watched this movie and I remember when I watched it back in the 80,s, I thought how much darker it was than Raiders. The opening sequence was classic Indy with a bit of James Bond car chase thrown in, but the storyline of child slavery and voo-doo was a bit much. The movie really took off in the mines and the chase in the mine carts was very entertaining and the sequence on the wooden bridge added to the climax. A few annoying things like Willie, who was there more comic relief, but Short Round did make the movie more entertaining, and would have been a very different movie without him in it. Overall, I enjoyed the movie but it is not a movie that I will watch over and over again.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
305,antonjsw1,Technically very accomplished but too mean-spirited,7,12 November 2010,"The decision to darken the tone doesn't entirely work for this film.Set several years before Raiders of the Lost Ark, the focus of this story takes place in India (but shot in Sri Lanka and Elstree Studios), presumably to have a different set of villains from the previous film. The film's opening credit sequence is unnecessary self-indulgence, and is totally out of place in terms of the subsequent story. However, the following scene in club Obi-Wan (really subtle I know) is very clever and works extremely well, putting Indiana Jones in the situation totally consistent to what we saw in the previous film. The action is ingenious and exciting. The following sequences in the streets of Shanghai and aboard a plane over Asia work well and set up the story well. However, the role of the gold-digging nightclub singer Willie Scott (played by future Mrs Spielberg Kate Capshaw) is an unfortunate miscalculation and I found totally annoying throughout the film, and makes it hard to sympathise with the predicaments the character gets into. In fact, I go through the film wondering if the character had been killed whether it would have bothered the audience at all? This is indicative of a broader problem in the film. The view of making the second film in the series darker in tone is not in itself an issue (see Empire Strikes Back as an example of how that approach can work), but the problem the film has is that there is insufficient development of the characters to make you care about the predicaments they get into. The focus of the story seems to be how far the film-makers can grow to gross-out the audience and not get an adult rating, and as a result the film feels more like blatant audience manipulation rather than genuine entertainment. I felt that what might have been an interesting script by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz become focused towards set pieces and gross out moments, that is would appeal to the more obvious audience manipulation phase that both director Stephen Spielberg and executive producer George Lucas seemed to be going through at the time. Even the villains of the piece are not sufficiently fleshed out in this film, and as a viewer I felt much less involved in the story.I found few of the characters in the film at all memorable. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Indiana Jones this time around is more understated, but since the character is given little development or anything of interest to do except react to the events the character is not as engaging this time around. Background characters are genuinely unmemorable or annoying (Willie Scott). The only character in the film I was drawn to was Indy's sidekick Short Round, who was very well played by child actor turned stunt co-ordinator Jonathan Ke Quan. While the character's background and connection to Indy is never clearly explained, his character generates some sympathy and I found when his he is directly contributing to the story, the film became more interesting and involving. The only aspects of the film that are genuinely appealing are the impressive technical achievements within the action sequences. These include a series of accomplished live action sequences that take place in a mine, and on a rope bridge. ILM's Oscar winning visual effects work, led by Oscar winner and ILM veteran Dennis Muren (already an Oscar winner for Empire Strikes Back, ET and Return of the Jedi, and would go on to collect more awards for T2 and Jurassic Park) is more subtle in this film, but culminates in a terrifically staged mine car chase sequence , which is the film's highlight, demonstrating flawless editing (Spielberg's regular Michael Kahn) between live action and miniature elements. However I was still surprised that the film won an Academy Award for visual effects as I felt more interesting and pioneering work had been done on Ghostbusters and 2010 that year. There is a witty homage to David Lean in terms of how some of the jungle plain sequences are shot, with an epic and wide scope to them. John Williams's score is as usual very accomplished. However it accentuates the mean spirited tone of the film and lacks the heart of Raiders of the Lost Ark, again making the audience less involved with the characters in the story. Mention also has to go to miniature supervisor Lorne Peterson's work on this film and George Gibb's live action effects work. Peterson has gone on to be a very successful miniature builder for Hollywood films, and Gibbs would win a second Oscar for his on-set work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit and work on a large body of high profile films subsequently. Douglas Slocombe's photography is impressive, ably assisted by some effective Steadicam work at the film's climax, and Eliot Scott's production design work evokes the time period very well. Overall an impressively well made but distant and uninvolving story marred by self indulgent, blatant and unsubtle audience manipulation.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Why it took them so long to make Lego game for kids based on this film is anyone's guess. Truth be told, Temple of Doom is bar none, without a doubt, no question, THE funnest Indie film EVER made. I'm serious! It is what you call a ""complete movie."" The best movies offer you a little bit of everything. Back to the Future is a fantastic ""complete movie"" because it gives you, comedy, drama, adventure, emotion and oedipal complexity. Temple of Doom gives you action, drama, comedy, romance, man-eating crocodiles, giant bugs, chilled monkey brains, a friggin AWESOME mine cart chase and a semi-accurate history lesson all in one glorious adventure!
Short Round is a highlight as a little ball of squeak toy energy and cartoon charisma. He also packs a not-so-pint-sized punch. Watch him as he holds his own against the Turbanator before Indy sends the giant Indian to roll n' rock bottom. Unfortunately Shorty seems lacking when it comes to common sense.

The entire middle section of the movie is annoying, especially cheap, dated jokes about the ""weird food"" people who are not like us eat, and the reliance on the Thuggee cult.  But the weaknesses extend beyond that, too.  Unlike in the first and third, Indy doesn't have a true quest that stems from his knowledge and love of archaeology.  He almost literally stumbles across a village who needs a sacred stone returned, and so he obligingly goes and gets it.

309,mrspasm,Crack that whip! Liquorice Whip!,10,7 January 2010,"'Save me Indiana, your our only hope!' comes the eternal line from this Lucas classic. Dr Jones has been in 19th Century China for the weekend in search the famed Diamond of Chung –Sh- g'Argolarath. After an exciting chase through downtown somewhere Indy and his trusty companion Skid-Mark escape to a plane. Unbeknownst to them though, the plane belongs to Hitler and they are in for ein bumpy ride. Also unbeknownst to them, they know that Willy Fog- an ex of Indianopolis has stowed away on the plane also as well. Once the pilots have reached 300 feet (known in nautical terms as Terminal Velocity) they parachute out leaving the trio to plummet to their deaths. Indy and Diddy-Kong search the plane but unfortunately find there are only 'four more parachutes!' As there are four parachutes and 3 people this proves to be too confusing a mathemagical conundrum for them and they crash into the earth, dead.Awaking in the afterlife they find that they are stranded in a crazy nether region full of 'vampiric' bats and Induans. Dr. Johns sees this as a valuable archaeological study- if he can somehow bring himself back to life with some proof of this city of the afterlife then he will be a millionaire. Indy, Willy, and Side-Kick find a mountain village where all the children have been kidnapped or eaten by an evil sect of demons. They stole some precious God stones from the village elders and have been powerful freaks ever since. They plead with Indy to rescue the children and the stones, and in return they will send the gang back to Earth in time for supper. Soon they find themselves in a palace type fortress full of lovely food such as Monkey's filled with snakes, snakes filled with monkeys, monkey's filled with skunkies, and of course staples. Everything looks normal, or as normal as it can be for being a unique tomb of the abnormal. They investigate further and find a slave trade, murder, torture, and humane sacrifice. The main bad guy is called Kal Yer Ma and he delights in his demonic vestal rites, puling out hearts at will and hypnotising people at a glance. He throws Willy into a volcano, turns Mindy into a slave, and only Kick-Start can save the day.Suffice to say all this is very funny and excitement. There are the usual jokes, fights, and chases- the best being the mine cart ride where Diddy Kong keeps being stretched across the tracks. A fat guy gets crushed by a fat stone, spikes come out of ceilings, spiders and crabs and beasties crawl everywhere, and the finale is a big fight and chase in a tank across a rope bridge over a pit of croc infested lava. All in all this is the best Indymania film and I would suggest that you watch it with your eyes.

It was.I remember thinking, when younger, I was missing out on something important to the Indiana Jones movies.

311,jmmustchin,"Interesting, but horrific",10,30 June 2018,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is the second (chronologically first) Indiana Jones movie, following Raiders of the Lost Ark (which I loved). It's set a year before Raiders, in 1935.But first, some historical background for the movie. The Thuggee - often called the Thugs (where we get our word Thug) were a religious criminal cult that operated in India between the mid-1300s to the mid-1800s. They were quite vicious. Many - probably most - Thugs were Hindus, who targeted caravans (pretending to be travelers to gain the other travelers' trust), killing travelers as a human sacrifice to their goddess Kali. They strangled the person, and afterwards mildly mutilated part of the body. They usually robbed the persons they killed. They often recruited the children of their victims, with the presence of children dampening other travelers' suspicions. A very large minority of Thugs were Muslims who killed - in pretty much the same way - purely for the riches. All were superstitious, however, and believed themselves the offspring of Kali. The British began to learn of the problem in the early 1800s, and began to take action against them. They largely suppressed the Thugs in the 1830s, and they disappeared completely (as far as anyone knows, anyway) in the 1870s.OK, now that that's out of the way, what about the movie?Temple of Doom focuses on the evil Thugs, in particular on the area of uncertainty when any cult dies out: do they secretly exist underground?In the movie, Indiana Jones, Willie Scott and Short Round just escape from Hong Kong after falling afoul of a crime lord. However, the plane they hopped in is owned by the crook! The pilots sabotage the plane and bail out. After failing to stabilise the plane, Indy, Willie and Shortie are forced to bail out over India - just before the plane crashes and explodes. After an unrealistic (but funny) ride down a mountain on an inflatable rubber dinghy (yes, they bailed out of the plane in that), they come across a village where all the children are missing, and the people are practically starving. They are informed that an evil cult operating unsuccessfully tried to convert them, before burning their crops, stealing their sacred Sankara Stone (which allegedly has supernatural properties), and kidnapping their children. One of the missing children - severely malnourished - returns that night, and reveals he escaped from Pankot Palace. The next day, Indy, Willie and Shortie set off for Pankot.Indy learns that Pankot Palace was once, a hundred years beforehand, the base for a Thuggee cult. A British army officer is there, investigating reports of a revived Thuggee cult operating out of the palace. Pankot's Maharajah and Prime Minister, Chattar Lal, give them hospitality but, partly to scare them off, serve them with disgusting food that Indians don't normally eat. Lal in particular acts slightly suspiciously - especially when Indy confronts him at dinner about the palace's history, and the evidence for the Thugs operating out of there.That night, after Willie and Indy (who had been developing romantic feelings for each other) have an argument, a Thuggee assassin attempts to kill Indy, but Indy and Shortie kill him. Indy then goes to Willie's room searching for an assassin there, but doesn't find one. Instead, he finds a secret booby-trapped passageway (crawling thickly with insects - really upsetting Willie) leading to an underground Thuggee temple.Now, up to this point the movie was really fun to watch. It was quite good. To this day, I would give the first half of the movie a 9 or 10. But from the moment they entered the temple, things changed. It became much darker and more horrific. This is when they introduce the historical Thuggee cult in action.Indy and Willie stumble across the temple just in time for a human sacrifice. Not the strangling one that the real Thugs did (which would have been uncomfortable to watch), but ripping the heart out (a nod to the mild mutilating the Thugs did) and lowering the poor victim into a lava pit - somehow still alive. It's a very horrible scene to watch. It's shown in as much detail as possible - even reaching into the chest. From then, it just deteriorates into horror. After the ceremony, Indy tries to take one of the three Sankara stones place in front of the giant (and horribly ugly) idol of Kali. He then discovers that the Thugs are using the kidnapped children as slaves in a mine in horrible conditions (a nod to the historical recruiting of their victims). The trio are captured. After being whipped (along with Shortie), the Thuggee high priest forces Indy to drink blood or something from from a ROTTING SKULL. This again is really uncomfortable to watch. Especially as the drink puts Indy into a trance and makes him an evil slave. Shortie is made a slave in the mine, while Willie is selected as the next sacrifice. It was at this point that we turned the TV off. This movie has a really interesting premise - probably more historically based than the other movies in the series. There is certainly a greater threat to the world. As the high priest explained, they are mining for the two remaining Sankara Stones (in addition to mining diamonds and jewels to fund their operation). Once they have all 5, their full power will be unleashed, and they will take over the world for Kali. In his words, ""The British in India will be slaughtered. Then we will overrun the Muslims and force their ""Allah"" to bow to Kali. And then the Hebrew God will fall and finally the Christian God will be cast down and forgotten."" I always found that part interesting.But in the end, the movie is just too horrific to watch (unless you've got a very strong stomach). I can't say I'd recommend it.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Not the strangling one that the real Thugs did (which would have been uncomfortable to watch), but ripping the heart out (a nod to the mild mutilating the Thugs did) and lowering the poor victim into a lava pit - somehow still alive. It's a very horrible scene to watch. It's shown in as much detail as possible - even reaching into the chest.From then, it just deteriorates into horror. After the ceremony, Indy tries to take one of the three Sankara stones place in front of the giant (and horribly ugly) idol of Kali. He then discovers that the Thugs are using the kidnapped children as slaves in a mine in horrible conditions (a nod to the historical recruiting of their victims). The trio are captured. After being whipped (along with Shortie), the Thuggee high priest forces Indy to drink blood or something from from a ROTTING SKULL. This again is really uncomfortable to watch. Especially as the drink puts Indy into a trance and makes him an evil slave.Shortie is made a slave in the mine, while Willie is selected as the next sacrifice. It was at this point that we turned the TV off.This movie has a really interesting premise - probably more historically based than the other movies in the series. There is certainly a greater threat to the world. As the high priest explained, they are mining for the two remaining Sankara Stones (in addition to mining diamonds and jewels to fund their operation). Once they have all 5, their full power will be unleashed, and they will take over the world for Kali. In his words, ""The British in India will be slaughtered. Then we will overrun the Muslims and force their ""Allah"" to bow to Kali. And then the Hebrew God will fall and finally the Christian God will be cast down and forgotten."" I always found that part interesting.But in the end, the movie (the middle part, anyway) is just too horrific to watch (unless you've got a very strong stomach). I don't know that I'd recommend it (unless you've got a good constitution).",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
313,Pelrad,"By far, the best of the trilogy and the greatest adventure movie of all time",10,12 April 1999,"This, I consider not only the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy but the best adventure film of all-time. I thought that the first in the series was ruined with its cheesy one-liners and silly ending of ghosts and goblins flying all over the place, and the pace of the third in the series I found too slow in light of the first two and the sick acts of fornication by Indie and his father with the same woman? Yuck! The ""Temple of Doom"" film centres around the archaeologist professor who travels through India only to find that magical stones that held a village together were stolen by the members of a temple satanic cult. The film is one of the fastest-paced adventures of all-time as geniuses Steven Spielberg and George Lucas combine forces to come up with a film that never has a dull moment. I was especially impressed with the accuracy in the cultural customs shown of the Indian villagers. (Not to accept a gift - of food - is an insult to them). It is true, believe it or not, that in some parts of the world, in history, monkeys' brains were eaten as shown! (10 out of 10)",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
314,LagerLagerLagerShouting,Scream And Scream Again.,6,1 May 2008,"Although undoubtedly the worst of the trilogy by some way, IJATTOD is still harmless fun with some good action sequences and the cliffhanger bit with the crocodiles at the end is worth waiting for. This one is probably the most politically correct out of the trilogy as well seeing as it involves children being used as slaves. It has its themes set firmly with adolescence and Indy here is seen as kind of a role model, a grumpy one at that and his relationship with Short Round gives the film its heart. It too is arguably the most violent of three with some pretty unfriendly scenes for a family movie, this makes it darker than Raiders and Crusade. But this does not really account for much as the whole premise is a bit dull and Kate Capshaw screams a bit to much for my liking. Harrison Ford too seems to walk through his Indy role and the kid from The Goonies plays, well, basically the kid from the Goonies again minus the gadgets! 6/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
315,superboy478,A Fun Sequel,10,7 March 2002,"This movie is far more different than Raiders of the Lost Ark. This time, Indy has new sidekicks, there are new settings, and the biggest one of all: This is a PREQUEL to Raiders of the Lost Ark!After escaping a scheme in Shanghai in 1935, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and his new love interest Willy Scott (Kate Capshaw), and a junior tag along who goes by the name Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan), aboard a jet that ends up crashing and leaving them deserted in India. While there, they are taken to a tribe of poor people and discovering a group of savages from Pancot Palace took the tribe's sacred stones and the children as well.So, the leader of the tribe sends them to Pancot to get the stones and save the children. When they finally arrive at Pancot, they discover a back door in their rooms and so they end up taking on hell of a trip through a hall and tunnels of booby traps, deadly spikes, poisonous insects.After the halls and tunnels, they arrive in a hidden temple that the savages are from. In this temple, they execute any witnesses and they make children slaves. After seeing a local get his heart ripped out (I mean this literally) by a priest in the group, Indiana and Willy and Short Round know that they're all in deep s*** with getting out of that place. They (Indy and the other two) are caught stealing the stones which leads the savages chaining up Indy and making him drink blood that turns him evil. All is bad until Short Round saves both Indiana and Willy from these people.The rest of the movie after all of this is fun and adventure. But, not like Raiders though.Produced by George Lucas (Episode II: Attack of the Clones), and directed by Steven Spielberg (Minority Report), The Temple of Doom is a great sequel that is really worth seeing.Appropriate Ages: 9 & up.*Note: During the filming of this movie, Steven Spielberg began dating Kate Capshaw and that eventually led to them getting married.

318,Filvies144,Indiana Jones and the tumble of doom after the first one.,5,20 November 2015,"Indiana Jones 1 and 3 are amazing films for their adventures, suspense, and treasure. I haven't seen much of the 4th one, but it's not that good. But what about Temple of doom? Well, I didn't really like it as much, and here's its problems.The plot in this is about Indiana Jones escaping from Shanghai bringing a singer and a child. They fly toward India and crash land into an Indian village where Indy learns about powerful stones and discovers an evil empire within. This movie is supposed to be a prequel to Raiders of the lost ark (which was better). We can tell its stand alone. It doesn't lead into Raiders at the end, no characters from Raiders are mentioned, and its not even important to the Indiana Jones franchise. Also, can I just mention that the plot doesn't work for Indiana Jones. Instead of getting involved in an adventure slowly but surely and even fighting the Nazis like in Raiders, they just get there by crashing a plane. That isn't a good way to get you in when it comes to Indiana Jones. It's just not executed that well. So this story is 100% bad, right? Wrong. I will give it some credit because the opening scene, while not as exciting as the one in Raiders, serves a purpose, which led to the 3 going on the plane. Plus sometimes I didn't care about the stones as much as the getting-out-of-the-temple goal in the second half. It can be enjoyable at times, but it still doesn't make up for this choppy story.The special effects in this are great like in Raiders. Its very enjoyable and is a good quality for Indiana Jones for its fun and excitement when they those stunts would come its just engaging. But one problem is that some special effects don't look too good like you can tell its filmed on a green screen. One other problem is how it gets to get so gory when that scene with the heart removed plays. So overall, the special effects in this can be really good.The characters in this movie aren't much better than the choppy story. First off, lets start with the characters I like. Indiana Jones would be one because of his bravery and un-annoyance, and a bit charm. The villains in the movie are mostly ruthless, but not as good as the Nazis (Fun fact: Temple of doom is the only Indiana Jones film with the antagonist not being based on any real life armies since the ones in Raiders and Last Crusade are Nazis while the ones in Skull were Soviets). As for the rest, Willie is the love interest with a love/hate relationship with Indy and spends lot of time screaming, making her a huge step down from Marion from Raiders. Short round is the innocent little boy who looks at Indy as a father going on this dangerous adventure. For the others, there are gangsters from the beginning, the village kids a, the royal kid who I just want to strangle like Homer strangling Bart, the list goes on. So overall, this characters aren't very good in this move other than Indy.So overall, even with the things it did do right like the good special effects and important beginning, Temple of Doom is a film that is just meh. But compared to greats like Raiders of the lost Ark and the Last crusade, its a disappointment. For Indiana Jones fans, its just a pass, or a rental if you're curious. And one last thing: Don't let your kids see it till they are 12. This is not a 2 hour Brochure to India.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
319,ubtgkse,Prepare your hatorade,5,13 July 2020,"I'm not a fan of this movie. There is good stuff I like. Harrison Ford is amazing as Indy and is the only one I found funny, most of the effects are great, the mine cart scene is fun, and the heart ripping scene is awesome. But the middle of the movie really drags and gets boring, the green screen at the end is atrocious, the slapstick isn't that funny, and Willie and short round are annoying to the point when willie is falling into the lava I wanted them to die.

322,josephrygaard,Before Watching: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984),4,5 September 2019,"""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (1984) is the sequel to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and the second movie in the Indiana Jones-franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Like its predecessor, Temple of Doom benefits mostly from its nostalgic characteristics. Technically, it has a lot of elements that can be questioned, but as apparent in this movie's rating, nostalgia can overcome that. If you are looking for some easy surface-entertainment, Temple of Doom works fine.As for those mentioned elements however, the movie is a slight structural mess. The second act is surprisingly short with mostly exposition and a not-so-subtle reveal of the main antagonist. Instead, the last half movie is almost entirely spent on the third act, which can feel quite prolonged and drawn out. 20-30 minutes could have been edited without missing out on the plot, as every necessary climax inclusion is a 4-5-minute show of different ""exciting"" spectacles. Close gunfire doesn't hit, unless fired by British troops at 4 times the distance of the native Indians. Unfortunately, the suspension of disbelief along with interest doesn't go as far.Temple of Doom also features a rather long scene with some sensuality, and later equally long scenes with graphic and gory details. On top of all, the Indians are portrayed primitively, clumsy, and sometimes flat out stupid, which only bolsters the ""white savior""-role that Indiana Jones get to play. Needlessly to say, this movie hasn't aged particularly well, unless one has aged with it. It can easily be skipped from the Indiana Jones-franchise. Worry not too much though, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is far better.My personal grade: a disappointing 4/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
323,elipsenbarnick,"Good Film, Too Much Funny",6,13 August 2019,"It is a great film, dont get me wrong - it's just that I would much rather watch Raiders of the Lost Ark.This film has too many jokes and it doesn't take itself seriously. This works in its favor at times, but I struggle to enjoy a film that just feels like a joke.I am going through and rewatching these films as I havent seen them in quite some time. I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up below Crystal Skull this time around. Good film nonetheless - it should be required viewing for children or teenagers!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
324,GEM-20,A Thrill To The End,7,29 February 2000,"""Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom"" is a terrfic movie and is a lot of fun to watch. Set in 1935, this would technically be a ""prequel"" to ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"", not a sequel.""Temple Of Doom"" is a different movie than ""Raiders"". Indiana Jones is more reactionary. He spends little time actually being an archeologist. Instead, he has to help a tribe of natives get back a sacred stone that had been stolen by a cult. Sure, there are some intense sequences involving the ordeal Jones goes through to become part of the cult. This was the first movie to get the ""PG-13"" rating. It is the intensity of the cult scenes that earned the film this rating.Steven Spielberg himself lobbied for the PG-13 rating. He knew the film would lose a lot of money if it carried an ""R"".I do not recommend this one for young children. However, for someone who might be looking for a thrilling adventure, I do recommend it. Leave your brain at the door, and prepare to have fun.

325,michaelheiser-25099,Good sequel!,7,9 November 2021,"Good sequel to the original 'Raiders'. Temple of Doom is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best Indiana Jones film. I know a lot of nerds are going to disagree with me but I do think it superior to Raiders of the Lost Ark because I prefer the darker, nastier tone and the fact that it just doesn't let up from the word 'go'! Two hours of Temple of Doom's running time pass in a breeze of sheer adventure as Spielberg takes us from one memorable set-piece to another. The opening musical number, the fight in the Obi-Wan Club, the chase through Shanghai, the plane crash/dingy ride, the journey to Pankot Palace, the dinner scene, the human sacrifice, the freeing of the slaves, the mine-cart ride, the water rush, the rope bridge, the cliff-hanging...wow! How much more can you pack into a film? It's physically impossible!Originally criticised on it's release for being too dark, Temple of Doom still ends up being a classic. I guess the audiences of 1984 were expecting Raiders of the Lost Ark 2 and were taken aback when they got something else. If you watch it with the others you can feel how different the film is with no scenes taking place in America, no University and no Sallah or Marcus Brody.John Williams' brilliant music is also at it's best. He even received an Academy Award nomination despite already being nominated for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, which is quite rare. The film did win an Oscar for its visual effects (beating the equally impressive effects of Ghostbusters) which, when viewed today, at least might seem a little bit dated, but still hold up quite well.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
326,Tyler_R_Weston,The Temple of Doom...The Expedition of Indiana Jones Continues,10,2 July 2004,"Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford have done it again! They've taken the character of Indiana Jones and used him to impress people all over the world with his latest adventure, the journey through the Temple of Doom! I wouldn't say that this is the best Indiana Jones film of the trilogy, but in a way each Indiana Jones film gets more and more entertaining. Indiana, along with two other explorers, lead their way into the Temple of Doom where they must fight for survival! From black magic to tumbling bridges, the Temple of Doom is a film that no one should miss for the world! What impressed me was how Indiana Jones got himself and others out of hostile situations such as booby traps. Those proved to be awe-inspiring. What also impressed me was the brilliant acting of the young actor, Jonathan Ke Quan, who plays Indiana's young assistant and best friend. Indiana faces new villains and meets the lovely young woman, Wilhelmina Scott. The Temple of Doom is an impressive second installment to the famous Indiana Jones trilogy. This film made me want to run off and watch the conclusion of Indiana Jones' journeys. Until I found out that an Indiana Jones 4 was in production, then I realized that his adventures are not over yet. This left me inspired and will amaze audiences everywhere. However, Indiana Jones' adventures still aren't over.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
327,bastiaan0740,An adventure movie at his finest,9,2 October 2008,"Temple of doom has gotten a lot of critic for not living up to its prequel. Well, usually when we get a sequel, it tends to be a flawed continuation on the original. And one might think, because of the critic, that this is the case here.Don't be fooled, because it isn't. IJ:TOD was the first Indiana film I ever saw. The story was original, like all IJ movies, so it stands on its own perfectly. Maybe because of the fact I saw it first, I consider it the best installment. Or maybe because it reminded me of a mature 'The Goonies', especially with the cave chase. Jones, Short Round, Willie, and Mola Ram are all beautifully portrayed, whereas the maharajah, captain Blumburt, and the Japanese crime-lord are given marginal roles. The story, like the Goonies, and frankly all IJ movies, is very basic and honest: find the treasure to help the poor, before the bad guys find it and use it for evil. At the end of the day, it's Indiana's unique character that makes this movie stand out. Therefore, this movie, like all other Indiana's, is a winner.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
328,TheUnseenMovieLover,A Superbly Exciting and Hilarious Adventure,8,25 May 2008,"I don't understand why Temple of Doom has received so much negative feedback. Yes, it's the third best film in the series (only being better than Crystal Skull). The plot is wafer-thin and the artifact that Indy is after is easily the least interesting in the entire series. However, the real question is; who cares? Doom is still an exhilarating, brilliantly paced and extremely funny instalment which is worthy of the name Indiana Jones.Many people have accused Doom of being too dark and sadistic. Although it is darker and nastier than Raiders of the Lost Ark, I don't think that it has much, if any impact on the film's entertainment value. This is Steven Spielberg at his most OTT direction, and he directs Doom with a masterful yet effectively childish skill. It feels like Spielberg became a kid whilst making this film, crafting Doom upon his child-like instincts. His awe beautifully comes across to the audience, whilst also providing continual support for the cast and crew.Seeing as Raiders re-invented the action genre, it is fair to say that there were high expectations concerning the quality of the action sequences in Doom. Thankfully, they don't disappoint. The opening is unexpected, tense and superbly chaotic, and as with Raiders, the action doesn't let up from that point. There is also the terrific highlight of an excellent mine-car chase, which is packed full of danger, energy and literally unforeseen twists.Also on par with the fantastic direction and action set-pieces are the script and performances. As with Raiders, the script is intelligently written, with more than a healthy dose of action and adventure and some terrific humour (the dinner scene is grotesque yet uncontrollably hysterical). The script also reveals an intriguingly dark side to Dr. Jones which wasn't shown in Raiders, with the opening sequence and his brief stint as a zombie servant once again showing that Indy is a flawed and imperfect character. It also reminds us that that's what made us adore him so much in the first place.The performances are brilliant. Harrison Ford once again excels as Dr. Jones, bringing more depth and unpredictability to his character. Ford is Indiana Jones, and no one else can capture the essence and personality of the character like he can. As Indy's sidekick Short Round, Jonathan Ke Quan is energetic, funny and utterly endearing. He also gets some of the script's best lines, such as when he says ""Indy, I love you"" before smacking him with a torch to wake him from a manipulative trance.As Indy's love interest Willie Scott (no, that is not a joke), Kate Capshaw will either come across as a hilariously funny actress in a fish-out-of-water role, or the biggest mistake ever made in the franchise. Personally, I would go for the former. Capshaw's Willie is hysterically out of her depth, especially in the scene when she is trying to seduce Indy after he has almost been throttled to death. However, the character also grows throughout the story, transforming from a wailing drama queen into someone who is actually useful. Finally, in the role of the villain Mola Ram, Amrish Puri is pure perfection. He is extremely scary, skin-crawling, chilling and possibly the best all-out bad guy that Indy has ever faced. After Puri's brilliantly villainous actions, the comeuppance awaiting him is extremely satisfying.Technically, the film is dazzling. John Williams infuses his original, iconic score with more magnificent music, which is suitably dangerous, seductive and gripping. The editing by Michael Kahn is just as, if not more impressive than Raiders, once again throwing us from thrill to excellent thrill with just the right amount of time for character development. Also, the sets are brilliantly designed, and fully capture the flavour of the series whilst also standing out on their own. Finally, the stunts are magnificently orchestrated, and make the action seem all the more real.Overall, Doom isn't the best film of the Indiana Jones series. But it is still an exceptional piece of entertainment, with fantastic action, a game cast, an intelligent script and uncontrollably energetic direction by Steven Spielberg, whilst being firmly backed up by a top-notch technical crew. It is a brilliant addition to a wonderful series, and doesn't deserve the amount of negative feedback that it has endured.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
329,Parks,Shriek! Yeek! Aiee! Squeal!,5,17 June 2017,"There are so many great things about this film - the opening dash for the poison, the traps beneath the palace, the mine chase and the exciting confrontation on the bridge, and of course Harrison Ford.Which makes it all the more frustrating that it also contains such boneheaded elements and irritating side-kicks. Neither Willie Scott or Short Round seem to be able to communicate without yelling or screaming, even when not in peril. From ""YOU CALL HIM DOCTOR JONES!!!"" to ""DIAMONDS!!"" or ""TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT I SLIPPED THROUGH YOUR FINGERS"" to ""VERY FUNNY! HA HA! ALL WET!"" The shouting (and the over-acting) never ceases.This isn't just some middle-aged cynic speaking by the way. Even as a 15 year old seeing this in the cinema, I wished Short Round could be replaced by Squashed Flat.Add to that a frankly ridiculous escape from a crashing plane, an embarrassingly awful ""funny food"" routine and some pretty bad racial stereotypes and it's really only the fact that Spielberg stages the action well that kept me watching.It's hard to say whether this is worse than Crystal Skull, which had serious problems of its own. But despite that, I think part 4 is not as much of a chore to sit through as parts of this film.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
330,JAM-31,One of the Greatest Thrill Rides Ever!,10,19 September 2000,"Some spoilers.I saw ""Temple of Doom"" back when it opened in 1984 for my tenth birthday, and to this day, I've never had more fun at the movies.  When it was over, I felt like I had lived it--I watched most of it through my hands!  The movie holds up well--it's still a true cliffhanger in every sense of the word. 
The first scene is an almost homage to James Bond, and it turns into a hilarious riot, followed by a great chase scene through the streets of Shanghai.  After that, and a roaring sled down an Indian mountain, we are given a brief rest.  We learn about the plight of a small Indian village, and its lost Sankara Stone.  I like how this story seems more of a ""typical"" adventure that Indiana Jones would partake in--he's not saving the world, and nobody but those who know him will probably know that this ever happened.  Before the second half of the movie starts, Spielberg gives us glimpses of the shocking and sometimes brutal humor that he will always be associated with; eyeball soup, jungle critters, idols decorated with human remains.  Once the second half of the movie begins, you barely have time to catch your breath!  It's endless, edge of your seat excitement.  All of the villains in this movie are excellent!  Lao Che, Chatter Lal, the pesky Maharaja, the thuggies, and Mola Ram make up a totally sinister, bloodthirsty group of bad guys.  Indy, Willie, and Short Round also have great chemistry. 
The humorous brutality of this film gives it its character.  You will feel every punch, and the impact of every bone-crunching rock or hammer, while you can't help but laugh (""Short Round, quit foolin' around with that kid!"").  Spielberg also does a terrific job with suspense and at scaring us--I jump every time Indy grabs Willie's hand when she tries to bail him out of the trap.  We must also thank Michael Kahn's flawless editing.  The sets are creatively designed and masterfully constructed, and the music and sound effects add an enormous amount to the mood of this film.While I marvel at the great production values of this movie, I can't finish without stating that TOD will at times have your heart racing (next to your adrenalin).  It brings tears to my eyes when Willie tells Indy, ""Let's get the Hell outta here!"" and Indy replies, ""Right.  ALL OF US!,"" and he begins the slave children's crusade.   Towards the end of this movie, one might think that we have already seen so many stunts, action sequences, and close calls, that there can be no way that the finale of the film could live up to the rest of it.  Then, Spielberg hits us with the mining car chase scene.  I have seen the chase scenes in ""Bullet,"" ""The French Connection,"" and ""Ronin.""  In my opinion, TOD has the BEST CHASE SCENE EVER FILMED!  I can really say nothing more about it, other than it has to be seen to be believed.Then comes the climax on the bridge, and Spielberg still has more tricks up his sleeve!  He succeeds by topping himself over the rest of the movie with possibly the most thrilling stand off ever seen!Roger Ebert claimed that after seeing this movie, you will leave with a ""bruised forearm"" (from your date gripping it so tightly.)  I couldn't agree more.  Grade; A+",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
331,stiv-7,Chris needs his head screwed on straight!,9,1 October 1999,"This much-maligned entry is second only to Raiders in quality. A lot of people rant about the violence, the lack of a strong female heroine, and the overall frivolousness of the film, to which I say BAH!!! Unworthy heathens! Spielberg, who in recent years has come to view the film as a ""mistake"", was trying for a very strong 30's B-movie feel, and I think he succeeded.(makes me wonder how he views ""Always"", not to mention ""1941"". Yes, this is not a film for children, but neither are the other two entries in the series, with their respective images of melting, exploding, and rotting bodies in replete gruesome detail. This is a homage to serials of the 30's, and as such, the plot involving the occult rather than Christian folklore is more than appropriate. Willie Scott, as a heroine, is weak, because Indy retreats to weaker women as a result of his failed relationship with the teenage Marion (when was the last time you studied psychology, Chris?).

332,Maddy-the-Weinerdog,Jarjar and Chewy,5,25 October 2019,"Temple of Doom is not even close to the near perfection of the first film. Watch Raiders of the Lost Ark instead.Ugh. The attempt at humour throughout the movie is cringeworthy. I can see Jarjar Binks was modelled after Kate Capshaw's character. Even Jarjar had some redeeming qualities...or at least he didn't keep doing the stupid humor in almost every scene.Short round was an obvious attempt at a Chewbacca type character to play off Harrison Fords character. He even used similar dialog to talk to the kid. I guess George didn't think anyone would notice if he used a short Asian kid, instead of a tall furry Wookie. The kid wasn't that bad, even though his character should have been the worst thing in the movie.I definitely liked this movie more when I saw it originally at the theater, but after rewatching it, I see why I have Raiders burned into my memory, while Doom I had mostly forgotten about.The special effects were also sub standard, and what was with that ridiculous roller coaster attempt at action. Ugh again.While John William's music is flawless, they didn't use it properly in this movie. Sometimes they played Indy's theme song where nothing appropriate was happening. I think they figured the movie had a dull spot every once in awhile, so they played the theme.They definitely were hoping peoples love for the first film, would gloss over the banality of the second.I'll rewatch Raiders every few years, until I die.

I think it was because I didn't know how to react to a movie like this. I had never seen a movie like this before. I also believe we were too young to watch it as there are a few scenes that contain some real gross out or violent material. Not too mention this is extremely dark for something that was aimed at kids. But, this one really got me into films and I was running around pretending to be Indiana Jones getting in high stakes adventures.Right from the beginning of the film we are shown a quite nice transition from the Paramount logo to a metal gong that is hit to welcome you to the movie. Here we are introduced to Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) an American singer who is making it in Shanghai, 1935. Indy (Harrison Ford) is there to visit Lao Che (Roy Chiao) who quickly is wanting the ashes of Nurhaci which Indy has brought along with him. Oh, he also wants Indy dead, too. So once Indy escapes the clutches of Lao Che and then using a raft to jump out of a crashing airplane with no fuel Indy along with Willie Scott and his sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) visit an Indian village which has two major problems. The sacred stone that they keep in the centre of the village has been stolen by the thugee cult from the Pankot Palace. They have also kidnapped all of the children from the community. So Indy is off to Pankot Palace to in the very least investigate the claims made by these townsfolk. It is here that Indy encounters maybe the worst cuisine ever put out to guests in history. Some people took offence to this in saying that people of Indian heritage do not eat these things. Personally I look at it as a reference to James Bond's OCTOPUSSY where the villain had his own interesting tastes in food. Like this film is trying to do to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK it outdoes that Bond classic film and to some going over the line. I think it is quite funny, but first few times I saw it may have induced some screaming. He also enters a room full of squirming bugs and must try and escape a sealed off room with spikes lowering from the ceiling and ground below. We are also then introduced to the villain Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) of the story which Indy must battle. It is a very, very intense meeting of this character.
When I was 9 I thought that he was a truly evil villain. Within his introduction he rips the heart out of a defenceless man being sacrificed. To this day I can not believe this did not get a R rating when released.To me this is the hidden jewel of all the scores John Williams has done over the years. He was nominated for an Oscar, so maybe I am overstating that a little, but if you away the amazing Indy theme the music is very intense, scary, but also brilliant. He really adds a lot to the film with his music.Directed by Steven Spielberg (like all Indy movies) and it seems like come Oscar time they never think of him when he makes an Indy movie after RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. I think he really did a great job here in creating a film that actually doesn't allow you to breathe for very long, which I think great action films excel at. Written by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz based on a story by George Lucas.Personally I love Short Round and I think he is my favourite Indy character beyond well Indy of course. He can stand his ground, smart-mouth off and if not for him Indy would have been in real trouble in this one. Sadly, he is not in any of the sequels and in fact is never even mentioned, but he rocks in this one. Sadly as well there is no Denholm Elliott as Brody or John Rhys-Davies as Sallah which were both great characters in the original.One problem many people have with this film is the character of Willie Scott and I understand she does get annoying. As well she is no where near as well written or created as Marion from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. By one point in the movie I think all she really is doing is screaming, but in all honesty there is a lot to scream about including a rail system the three are trying to escape on in a mine cart. Pretty cool scene and I always enjoy watching it. I do have a problem with the Willie Scott character as we did need a stronger character like the original or just thinking outside the box here why not add John Rhys-Davies as well and have Indy, Sallah and Short Round in the Temple of Doom. Another problem is some of the dialogue is much more clunky than the original and does not flow like it did so perfectly for it.Anyways, I think I have gone on long enough and if you have read through this review I do not think it is a perfect film, but I have to thank Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Lucas for at least making the first 3 Indy movies and making me dream of being Indy when I was a kid. I would suggest though if wanting to watch this with your kids should have been at least rated PG-13 when it first came out. Of course there was no PG-13 rating when it came out.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
334,hitchs,This movie has not aged well,6,2 January 2007,"Watching Temple of Doom again after all these years was probably not a good idea. Apart from the final chase sequence, which is brilliant, I am not quite sure what I saw in this movie in the first place. It starts with a ridiculously over-the-top and quite illogical sequence set in Shanghai, aka Macau (why would a gangster bother to offer Indy a genuine poison antidote when he has no intention of giving it to him? For that matter, if he finds Indy so useful as a supplier of valuable artifacts, why kill him?), followed by one of the most absurd Hollywood clichés ever, when a plane with an empty fuel tank hits a wall and bursts into flame. After that, it doesn't get much better, with many more clichés and the excruciatingly bad performance by Kate Capshaw (though, to be fair to her, who could possibly perform well with such appalling lines?) Then the grotesque absurdity of a man pulling out another man's heart with his bare hand (apparently without encountering a ribcage on the way) and the heartless victim continuing to scream for a couple of minutes before being lowered into a cliché burning pit.The only reason I kept watching was knowing that the chase sequence was coming up - and even that wasn't as good as I remembered.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
335,yellowtail_tuna,Top notch action scenes,9,23 June 2020,"Although its the second film after ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the structure is quite different. Instead of traveling around the world, this time it is set in almost one location. Jones infiltrates into a Hindu cult palace, and tries to retrieve a mystical stone and save kidnapped children.I like Jones more than him in ""Raders"", because he is more bumbling and funny. The presence of Shorty gives Jones a good fatherly aspect. Shorty is fun to watch, with his cheerfulness and precociousness. Conpared with him, maybe Willie is less attractive. And I felt unsatisfied with the lack of remarkable villains.The set design is excellent, like the sinister goddess statue in the human sacriface ritual, lit up by the reddish glow from the lava in the abyss. It's also amusing to see the dinner scene where a series of unappetizing foods is served. I don't know how much these things reflect the actural Hindu culture though.Action scenes are of course top notch. Mostly set in the cave, what they have to deal with is more often dangerous traps, devices, and natural surroundings rather than human enemies. You just see a series of breathtaking moments, without being interrepted by boring explanation why it is happening.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
336,zurnderrick,"A Great Sequel, I mean PREQUEL",9,23 August 2009,"The Temple of Doom may be a sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark from a certain perspective, but in reality, it is a prequel to the blockbuster classic, if you look at the date in the very beginning. But anyway, The Temple of Doom is a masterpiece, with great action, great story, and great special effects. The sound of a lightsaber can be heard in one of the scenes, but I will leave that job to you.Harrison Ford is back in the role of Indy, and now has two sidekicks, the reluctant Willie Scott, and the rebellious child, Short Round. We are also introduced to a new villain, Mola Ram, a heart-ripping, Indian talking priest of the Thuggee cult. Some of the great action scenes in this film are the Shanghai chase, the apartment fight, and of course, that legendary mine cart chase.Overall,it's a great film to watch. A lot of people come up with a lot of things to nit pick about this film, but to me, it all comes down to a fun little blacksheep of the Indiana Jones series. So grab your monkey brain and your bullwhip and join the fun!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
337,jashezilla,Dr. Jones's most entertaining outing,10,23 September 2019,"Every single Indiana Jones film is phenomenal but Temple of Doom is probably my favorite of them all simply because of the good script, hilarious character interactions, great villains, the slight horror feel, and a good old-fashioned romance.

A man, woman, and a child go into the heart of a temple to get some stones and free children.  This movie has so much adventure in it that I could watch this movie all day back to back.  I love the fight scenes in this movie and the cart scene has got to be my favorite in the whole movie.  I think this Indiana Jones movie is the best one yet in the trilogy.

340,noelcox,A major disappointment,4,13 January 2003,"This film is a real disappointment after the enjoyable excesses of the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". There is a mere apology of a plot, and the film is essentially a series of disjointed action pieces. There is also unnecessarily vulgarity in several scenes. Fortunately the makers evidently realised their mistake and decided to give ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" a plot.This film is a good illustration of much of what is wrong with modern films. The emphasis is on action, to the exclusion of a credible plot. More seriously, it contains sexual references which are inappropriate in a film which appears in some other respects designed for pre-teenage children.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
341,epatters-3,Good not great prequel.,7,1 June 2008,"If you are expecting this to be a sequel, you will be disappointed. This is a prequel to Raiders of the lost ark. Temple takes place in 1935. Raiders takes place in 1936. Well, I have review the first and fourth one. I might as well review all of them. This is my least favorite of the 4 movies, but that does not mean that it is bad. 1 thing I don't like about the movie is short round. But Short Round is better then Jar Jar. This is the movie that inspired the PG-13 rating. It is true. This film was controversial with parents because there is a scene where you can see a man's heart being ripped out. This film is known as the straw that broke the parents back. Steven Spielberg said whenever he saw a child in the movie theatre, He would cover his eyes when it showed the heart rip scene. Well, it is a good not great film. So I recommend it. My least favorite of the 4 movies, though. My overall rating is 7 out of 10 stars.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
342,howellgirl2011,"It was an okay film, some things I did not like about it though!",6,23 January 2011,"I thought the film was okay, except for some things I had seen in the film. Like the scene where Willie is being lowered into the lava pit, I noticed that when she was going down the chains holding the cage were not moving, but she was screaming. I also noticed before she was put into the cage thing that she was wearing a lot of necklaces and big ear rings when put into the cage, that when Mola Ram was coming toward her the necklaces and ear rings had somehow come off of her nothing beautiful was on her besides the thing on her head. Also in this scene I thought that when Mola Ram was coming toward her it looked like he was smiling at her, and he wanted to scare her by pretending to almost rip out her heart. And he laughed when he was calling Indy(now under black sleep of Kali ma)to finish putting the last chain brace on her wrist. I loved all the scenes in the film but the story concept was way off. Like I know Indy, Willie, and Shorty are trying to save a village from a bad mess involving their stones being taken, but when they had gotten to the palace and saw the thuggee ceremony and then captured and then escape with the slave kids and the stones and killing Mola Ram and saving the day. But that really has nothing to do with Indy and the last film the way it was but this is really bad. I hope that the next film is better than this film, because there was so much wrong with this film, I can't think of anything good in this film. I hope that no one watches this film and writes good reviews about it because they need to watch the film over a few times and see the problems for themselves.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
343,jpc-34200,The Temple of Doom is darker than the first but it's still a fun and busy movie,9,28 March 2020,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom starts out with Kate Chapshaw during a Chinese version of Cole Porter's Anything Goes to Lao Che and his gangsters. Indiana Jone's adventure is in search of the Shankara stones and to save lost children being kidnapped by the evil Mola Rom played by Amish Puri. The Temple of Doom is directed by Steven Spielberg and it is rare that a sequel could be this good. I still love the mine car chase scene, the reptile dinner, the boogey ceremony and the draw bridge scene. The Temple of Doom is on the scale of a larger than life Saturday Matinee serial. I can't wait for the third part",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
344,paulmamak,"A required, but controversial, sequel to the franchise",7,26 May 2008,"This film may not have lived up its expectations after the release of Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it explored the darkened depths of cultures and archaeological artifacts, which is a subject that would have been met at some point by an archaeological adventurer. The film certainly has its strengths, including the opening musical number by Kate Capshaw followed by the confrontation of Lao Che by Indiana Jones in the style of film noir and also the car chase in the city of Shanghai that follows shortly afterwards. The water raft scene down the Himalayan Mountains was also highly packed full of adrenaline and well shot. The most powerful moment in the film, and even throughout the whole trilogy, is the arrival of the three at the village of which the Sankara Stone was taken, as we learn the suffering that it has caused the villagers, who are fighting for survival and mourning over the fact that the Kali took their children. Then we have the excellent cinematography of the Indian jungle, which were actually filmed in Sri Lanka. The set building of the Indian temple deserves appraisal, as well as the insect cave and the booby trapped room of spiked ceilings and floor. Then there is the mesmerising set of the Kali temple with the lava pit that gave the film its dark atmosphere. Ultimately, the mine tunnel chase was the greatest triumph of the film that, quite literally, takes the audience on a roller-coaster of a ride. Moreover, the rope bridge scene deserves great appraisal, bringing both excitement and suspense to the film as it reached its ending.The overall acting was adequate, Ford does well in picking up from where he left off as Indiana Jones. However, with this film he did well to represent more the suffering that Jones has to be put through. What was particularly spectacular was the way he was able to undertake the transformation from good to evil after drinking the blood of the Kali. He also did well to undertake much of the action scenes considering that he slipped a disc during filming. Kate Capshaw was outstanding in the opening dance number and did well as playing the damsel in distress throughout the rest of the course of the film. Although she was knocked by feminists by her performance throughout the film. This performance was understandable, as she plays a city girl who is plunged into the Indian jungle full of deadly predators and she is also exposed to the dark black magic of the Kali, which is not usually encountered on a daily basis. Jonathan Key-Quan also was outstanding in his role, some of the lines he delivered were absolutely hilarious and the action sequences and the choreography he completely mastered. Moreover, he gains full sympathy from the audience when struck by Jones and when he is sent to work with all the other slaves. Amrish Puri played an outstanding villain, as his psychically and acting made him absolutely terrifying. Moreover, he was the reason why the film was so dark. Overall, this film lacked the magic of Raiders, but this was because its theme dealt with much darker concepts. Although the darkened theme created controversy, this separates it from the rest of the franchise.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

For years I clearly only saw the edited version and only recently saw a cut where you actually see Mula Ramm plunge his hand into the first sacrifice victims chest and rip it out still beating as well as a painfully drawn out scene of the man being burned alive in the fiery pit. Also the scene where short round gets whipped was just so dark I can see why Spielberg cites it as his least favourite due to his and George's mood after their recent marriage breakups. None of it makes for a bad film though, not like Crystal Skull which is just terrible.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
348,MartPol,Remarkably average,7,2 February 2013,"Considering that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the most stylish, exciting family adventure film ever made, it's remarkable just how much Spielberg and Lucas lost their way on Temple of Doom.The script has little or no wit, the supporting female character is just irritating (what happened to Karen Allen?), there's casual racism galore, and the last half hour just feels like one identical piece of drawn-out tension. Despite virtually never pausing to take a breath, it's simply less interesting than Raiders because it lacks timing and intelligence.Still, it's Spielberg and Ford, so it can never be all bad, and there's usually enough going on to keep the attention. And maybe we can thank Temple of Doom for one thing; I think there's a strong chance that Spielberg decided to make the superb Last Crusade by way of an apology.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
349,Riddler2,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Wonderful Action Adventure!,10,21 June 2015,"After the Wonderful Family classic that is ET The Master of Film returned to the Indiana Jones series for the sequel to Raiders of The Lost Ark with a rip-roaring companion piece to Raiders of the Lost Ark but the film's tone is altogether slightly darker so younger children will need adult supervision compared to Raiders which is absolutely fine for all ages! Anyway The direction is similar to Raiders but this film moves from location to location with pristine ease and painstaking detail in the film's shot composition it really works visually more so than Raiders I adore Raiders but the visual presentation of Temple is so clearer and really visually stark and more interesting to look at because the pace is slowed down only slightly compared to Raiders but it still has that quick really breakneck pace of Raiders but it is slightly slowed only a little bit a tiny bit slower mainly for plot development a few times but it is still an excellent really different film compared to Raiders, As I say Raiders is the greatest action adventure film ever made but Temple really has a different approach to it's story the way the different plot points are introduced it really feels different and I admire that greatly well that's the brilliance of the Master of Film I guess! The Score By John Williams is altogether different we still have the iconic theme everybody knows but it is used only when appropriate but is then interspersed with all new themes for Willie Scott and Indy's relationship and Short Round Indy's new sidekick Indy and Short Round have a great relationship on screen together and it shows I hear Harrison Ford got on really well with the actor who plays Short Round who would later star in the Classic adventure movie the Goonies, back to the score the other new themes include themes for the Temple of Doom itself and the Slave Children's March is one of my many favourite individual pieces of music John Williams has composed it really captures that section of the film wonderfully the music in Africa as Indy, Short Round and Willie trek across the landscape is quite something to behold and hear I really love the End Credits Suite that combines all the themes from the film in perfect order All of John Williams's Scores have some sort of end credits suite at the end which is composed differently compared to the other variations or performances of the themes or musical identities so really listen to those end credit suite it really helps you identify each musical identification or melodic material it really is clear and catchy too! Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom does not get the attention it deserves sometimes so what if it is not exactly like Raiders so what it is a New Adventure for Indiana Jones and it is really entertaining scary funny mainly Short Round's comedy with Indy I really like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom because of the differences to Raiders and it is a great action adventure worthy of the Indiana Jones series!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

It's a little campier than Raiders with the dialogue and action, but still just as invigorating.There are cults, child slaves, and burning pits to challenge our heroes, who are more of a motley crew than usual. It's a little unbelievable that Indiana's company actually survives the hazards in this film, but it's OK. The action is fun and the pace fast enough that you don't really care.The film moves along and the adventure becomes ever more perilous. Will our hero's survive?

But that moment is my favorite moment in the whole film.It doesn't recollect the humor or suspense of Raiders, but who could not laugh at Short Round's remarks? Especially when Short Round says: ""He no nuts, he's crazy!"" And it was stereotypical at parts, (espically the natives), but it worked better then it did in High School Musical for example.

Amrish Puri playing Mola Ram could be seen outperforming the so called biggies of Hollywood, when the challenge comes their acting is seen as too ordinary with card board expressions. The only emotions seen in the movie are running around, moving all over the place with ropes and guns with the hero in his trademark hat. The only real performer is Amrish Puri with realistic emotions. No wonder Steven Spielberg had to concede & tell to the world of Cinema that Amrish Puri is the best villain of world cinema.

These first 20 minutes or so, from the Shanghai club to the plane crash, are pure music in moving pictures - they feel like one elegant, smooth motion. There are more spectacular parts in this and the other Indy movies, but this sequence of events shines with a perfect, mesmerizing pace.

Kate Capshaw's role and script were horrendous, completely silly, useless, and unsympathetic. The movie was actually depressing; it was very dark and more like a not-very-good horror film. It appeared they were trying to copy the Conan movie settings and stories, which was inappropriate for the Indiana Jones persona established in Raiders of the Lost Ark. The mine car scene continued a long time past the point at which it became boring, and the filming of it made it look just like an amusement park ride. Altogether, this is a pretty bad movie, and I do not expect to watch it again.There was one humorous item: the nightclub in the opening sequence is called Club Obi Wan, a reference to Star Wars.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Ke Huy Quan who Played Indiana Jones little sidekick Short round was cool and funny, and he played him perfectly..though i would have loved Marion Ravenwood to be back as the Indy girl. The Villain Mola ram played by Amrish Puri is my most favorite Villain out of the Whole series, great actor he is. The only thing that disappointing me was that it probably went to dark, and the story was a little disappointing...but other than that it's a great movie and adventure.Some of my favorite scenes are the River raft scene, The Heart scene, the scene where Indy verses the Giant Thuggee, The mine cart scene and The Bridge scene.Great movie but can never match up to the brilliance of Raiders.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

So much fun and thrilling action despite accurancy flaws on Indian culture and cuisine lol. Some mild horror even! The direction and pacing is one of a kind! It is a masterpiece in the series! Superb and Crucial John Williams' score. Different than the other Indiana Jones films in the series but never less, never dull. It keeps captivated due exemplary pacing of perfect balance of the scenes! As a 5 year old i was terrified of this one due darker content and the mild horror but that's what fascinated me and remembered me about this classic gem. There's a lot going on. Enough suspense and drama to keep it interesting.. Think Spielberg and the writers did a superb job going much further than with Raiders. This one's much darker, mysterious, more grim in a way and still keeping it accessible for the main public...
Just a huge shame they cut some of it afterwards cuz of public rating to get it cleared in some countries but that's with every flick. Terrific job nonetheless to all involved making this classic adventure gem! 👍👍👍",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
358,ladulaser,"Great action, no obvious errors",8,18 March 2002,"This movie was shown on Swedish TV3 last night, and although I don't like the quantity of commercials that channel like to rip up a movie with, I thought I wanted to see this movie because I've been very much into Hinduism lately and I remember that this movie was set in a Kali temple. Last time I saw it was '92 or something, and I also remember getting really frightened by some scenes, but now when I've been forged with movies like Bad Taste and Urotsukidoji, I thought I was ready to see this movie again. Right I was!As always in a Spielberg movie, there has to be a girl for the hero alongside all the action. I thought she could've been cut out of the script, all she does is scream when she gets frightened (and that's quite often, given that the major part of this movie is set in India where there's a lot of scary stuff in the eyes of an american girl) and complains about how awful everything is in India since she's used to living at hotels and drinking champagne in limousines and so on.The action itself is FUN! Not in the Chuck Norris/Steven Segall sense, where the hero is taking out so many enemies it becomes laughable, but in the sense that there is a lot of innovative ways that the hero uses environment and equipment to take out enemies or defend himself.Also, I am pleased to state that there are no socio-religious errors in the Hindu parts of the movie, Spielberg for once seems to have gotten all the facts right!I give this movie 8 out of 10, and I think that's fair given that I write this comment in 2002 and some of the visual effects leave a lot to wish.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Having seen it, I understand why.Short Round was good. Kate Capshaw was... yecchh -- a stereotype that ought to offend all self-respecting women. Many sequences (life raft as a parachute) were just too unbelievable, even by the standards of fantasy films. I never worried that any of the principals might actually get killed.The depictions of Thuggee religion probably offended about a billion Indians.

360,TanQ,Racist of the Lost Ark or Indiana Jones and the Temple of Intolerance,3,26 December 2016,"A hot mess of a film that shows the terrible things that can happen when two gifted directors get together to make a cash grab. It has been said that Spielberg wanted to re-create the adventure serials of his youth. It's too bad that he decided to reproduce the racial stereotypes of the time. I'm sure it was all done innocently enough, but the effect is cringe-worthy. Never has such a diverse cast been represented so dismally. Here's an idea for future filmmakers, if you're going to have a religious group as the villain in your adventure film, pick a fictional one instead of twisting an existing faith.Aside from that, things get pretty boilerplate pretty quickly in the film. You get a couple of interesting scenes at the beginning. including that airplane scene which other deride but I thought was pretty entertaining. It quickly turns into a series chase scenes and wunderkinder moments that follows the Spieldbergian pattern of precocious children who repeatedly save the day. Sight gags from the first film are re-used, confrontations are set up that never give you a sense of peril and the whole thing just plods along to an unsatisfying climax. I'd forgotten most of the film from when I saw it in the theatre, but after re-watching it I was actually surprised at the climax. I was so distracted by the terrible green screen effects that when the climax was over I actually thought ""oh, was that it?""This is one of those rare films where I would recommend you just skip it and use the time to play with your dog or read book.

362,jabarker81,"It's just strange, and uncomfortable to watch",5,17 March 2019,"The first part of the movie is decent, but unfortunately, it forgets about the characters in the beginning, and it just continues on, and acts like nothing ever happened. After that, it then gets into weird territory. The primary reason for the film's weirdness are the rituals, the treatment of the children, and just the overall premise and environment of the film. Even though I sometimes like strange films, this one is both strange and uncomfortable to watch. And yes, Kate Capshaw's performance is annoying as hell, and I did find myself saying, ""Oh, shut up!"" But I overlooked that. This is, in my opinion, probably worse than the fourth one. With Crystal Skull, I was comfortable. This one, I wasn't.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

364,soulfx-1,Horribly offensive (even for it's time),4,24 October 2021,This movie became a cult classic - but was based on horribly offensive stereotypes and a portrayal of Indian Hindus as a barbaric cult. There was a lot of controversy when the film was released for its portrayal of Hindu gods and white man's savior syndrome. This was back in the 80s.The film today is an embarassing cliche - it's difficult to watch Indy boss around a kid with a highly exaggerated Chinese accent.

The film feels incredibly dated for a 1980s production. The humour and stereotypes have a 1960's feel to them.
Harrison Ford is the only saving factor of this movie, and some of set pieces are as good as you'd expect from the franchise. Unfortunately the film just plods along and nothing much happens.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

370,m_pratt,fantastic one of the best!,10,20 May 2008,"I loved it!! i had seen this a while ago and thought it wasn't as good as raiders and crusade, but i watched it again last night and was engrossed! Its a different theme from the Nazis and mythical objects in Foreign countries but its worth watching. Its interesting to see Indy and the crew in a different country and the partnership between all three of them is great better then the partnership in Raiders and Crusade. The film was dark mysterious and devil like and was quite spooky in places such as the scene where Indy and the crew exit the spike chamber and walk into the red tunnel where they hear the chanting of the sacrifice that freaked me out. The tension in this film was heartstopping and gave the feeling of ' whats coming next'. The plot is that Indy has done some diamond deal in Shanghai and a fight breaks out and Indy is pursued in a car and then goes onto a plane which happens to belong to his enemy. The pilots bail out in mid flight leaving Indy Shortie and Willie to die in the crash but no ones going to die with Indy around so they jump out on a raft and sail down a icy slope off a cliff into a river which could be pretty dangerous as they could be crocodiles or anything which could tear a little raft like that to shreds!!. Anyway they reach a village where the villages beg for them to rescue the stones and their children in Pankot palace. They all set off and reach the palace. After a dinner of snakes beetles and eyeball soup they head to their rooms and thats where the adventure starts down a dark dank dingy creepy passage that leads to hell on earth the secret temple of the thugee cults a crazed group of Indians who worship Kali lead by Mola Ram a crazed high priest who perform graphic sacrifices. Indy decides that he will get the stones and is caught along with Willey and Shortie and is tranced to become one of them he soons snaps out and they attempt to escape in a mine car chase to a ledge 100 feet a river filled with crocodiles after freeing the enslaved children, the final showdown is on a rope bridge Indy has no alternative but to cut the bridge sending the Thugees to the crocodiles who are eagerley awaiting feeding time and have an extra treat as Mola Ram ends up for dessert.

This movie have AMAZING acting, AMAZING special effects, it's directed by the great Steven Spielberg, it has an AMAZING film score by the maestro John Williams, it has Amazing set pieces, and very quotable dialog. The Temple of Doom is a perfect movie in EVERY sense. It has tons of adventure, action, humor and a bit of romance, a little bit for every one.

372,jezre_17,An extraordinary WILD ride,10,28 April 2004,"Temple of Doom it's a hell of a movie no matter what the people said. It's more exciting, funnier, and more impressive than the first one.Yes, it's violent, but is not as bloody as `Raiders' is. Temple of doom deserves a lot more than it has, because is a non-stopping action sequel, in which you can't move from your seat while you are watching it; this movie moves, and moves, making you feel the real meaning of what an action movie means.The plot of the movie is real interesting, is by far nothing like raiders, it's a complete new adventure and situation. It's the search of a sacred rock which has been stolen from a village, and is used to worship an evil god: Kali. Following the adventure with Indiana J. is Short Round, and the singer Willie Scott.The cast is great, I can't understand why Kate (Willie) was criticized for her acting, her performance is just one of the most funny that I have seen in a female character: the way she complains about everything, the screams, her originality makes me laugh every time I watch this movie, besides for me she is the most beautiful of the three Indiana's girls. The villain Mola Ram is really creepy, I remembered that when I was a kid this guy really scared me just by seeing him laugh.CONTAIN SPOILERSThe action sequences, despite of being very unrealistic, are just impressive and make you feel the excitement through all your body: The plane crash sequence, the scene when Indiana and Short R. are trapped and Willie with all the insects tries to save them, the mine chase (For me this is one of the most impressive and exciting action sequence that I have ever seen in my life), and the falling bridge sequence.OK, I have to admit that some sequences are a little bit disturbing even diabolic, but `Raiders' it is exactly the same, just try to remember and think about it:RAIDERS: -In the first scene when Indiana is looking for the idol and the Latin guy who says `Adios señor' is killed by the trap and you can see the blades crossing his body and head, and Indiana says: `Adios Estupido'. -In the Marion's bar scene you can see very clearly how Indiana shots into a guy's head, and the head burst into blood. -In the Cairo sequence, again you can see how Indiana shots a guy in his chest and again in the head of the guy who was driving the truck with dynamite. -In the plane fight sequence all the sequence is too violent: punches, bites, even a guy killed by the propellers of the plane, and in a moment you can see the cockpit of the plane soak in blood. -In the car chase sequence you can see how Indiana really hates Nazis: gun shots, punches, even he murder a guy running over him with the truck. -And for the last you can see how several Nazis soldiers are killed by a mystique force, including two guys melting in a very bloody way concluding with a guy who is burning, to finally see how his head explode. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE THAT PEOPLE SAY THAT TEMPLE OF DOOM IS THE LESS GOOD OF THE THREE BECAUSE IT'S TOO VIOLENT.`Temple of Doom' rocks¡¡¡¡ (as well as the other two Indiana Jones movies), is by far one of the best action movies ever, so open your mind, relax and tight your seat belt for the wildest ride of your life.10/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
373,s-woodier,The best of the bunch.,10,3 October 2007,"I have a sneaky suspicion that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is Harrison Ford's favourite Indy movie. In a recent interview he said it has 'some crazy action in it'. His remarks seemed in defence of the movie. Temple of Doom has a different angle on Indy. Here, we see a man who is not after personal gain, but throwing himself into an act of selfless heroism. Edge of your seat excitement is what this movie specialises in and it has it by the cartload. We also have a stunning score by John Williams (Academy Award nominated), fantastic photography by Douglas Slocombe, great performances and uncompromising direction from Steven Spielberg. Indy has never been more battered and beaten than in this film and neither have the exhausted audience. Superb.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
374,StuDeb2,Disappointing,5,28 December 2019,Raiders was such a great movie. This one missed the mark. Interesting reading IMBD. The worst bit of this movie for me was always the female lead and her screaming and breaking a nail. She went on to marry Steven Spielberg so didn't turn out too bad for her. Could have been a really good movie. Harrison Ford carries it as much as he can even with calling the female lead doll.,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

376,Gordon-38,Are you kidding me? Nearly as good as Raiders!,10,30 December 1999,"Why's everyone so down on this movie?  For that matter, why does anyone in their right mind think that ""Last Crusade"" is better than this one? ""Temple of Doom"" takes Indiana Jones and puts him into a totally different scenario than what we've seen in ""Raiders,"" and the character still works.No, Kate Capshaw's character isn't as cool as the Karen Allen character from ""Raiders,"" but variety is the spice of life, and just cloning ""Raiders"" would have been boring - as ""Last Crusade"" perfectly illustrates.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
377,gstiger,Holy Smoke! Crash Landing!,7,19 April 2000,"A very good action film. I found this film to be very enjoyable. In my opinion it is the second best of the series, after the Last Crusade. This is definitely the darkest entry in the trilogy, but the story does manage to include a few elements of comedy. The action is first rate, especially the beginning and the climax. The character of Indiana Jones is further developed in this film, it shows that Indy is not just a greedy obtainer of antiquities. The character of Short Round is very interesting and humorous and well acted by Ke Huy Quan. The musical score is good. Some of the special effects are very nice, too.

My father decided to show it to me because ""you liked the first one"". My first reaction was ""yay, another fun action movie featuring my favorite movie hero"". Turns out my father probably tried to scare the everloving out of me. (Who does that to their kid btw?)Temple of Doom is one of the darkest movie you'll encounter. It deals such themes like child-slavery, extreme poverty, gangsters and cults. It features a supposed kali-worshipping-child-killing-human-sacrificing cult, operating inside the catacombs of the Pankot Palace in India. This cult did not exist in the real world, but the Thuggees we're a real thing in the 19th century India. They we're just your everyday gangsters who robbed and killed tourists. Yes, they worshipped Kali, but didn't sacrifice anyone for her.

380,Spider-52,Blatant attempt to cash in on the success of the original.,6,28 August 1999,"""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is by far the weakest film of the trilogy for a few reasons.First and foremost, the screenplay is just awful.  It seems Lucas and Spielberg thought they could emulate the success of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" by putting together a bunch of action sequences in disguise of an actual story.  The dialog is terrible, especially from Kate Capshaw and Jonathan Ke Quan (Willie Scott and Short Round, respectively--two of the worst character names of all time).There is absolutely no chemistry between Capshaw and Ford.  One of the reasons the first one worked so well was because of the romance between the two lead characters.  ""Indiana Jones and Temple of Doom"" falls flat in this area.Sure, there are a few good action sequences, but even they don't match up to those in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".  ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" is another example of the typical Hollywood blockbuster--some flashy special effects and action sequences thrown together to make a quick buck.  And that's unfortunate, considering the quality of the other two in the series.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

I probably would have stopped watching any other movie that was this bad, but it's Indiana Jones and the other two are great. The only good things I can say about Temple of Doom is that Shorty is adorable and Harrison is hot. That's literally it. Kate Capshaw's character was SO annoying! The screaming, over acting, and stupid comments we're enough to make me completely fine with her being the human sacrifice. Speaking of sacrifices, The second half of the movie was so dark. PG-13 would even be a stretch, and it's still rated PG!The only reason it has as high of a rating as it does is because it's Indiana Jones. The same quality movie without such a well known and loved character would have awful ratings.

Honestly, I don't know how much more we could realistically want from a summer adventure film. Suave nightclub scene erupting into machine gun fight? Car chase through crowded streets? Plane crash? Waterfall? Evil cultists ripping people's hearts out? Mine car chase? Flooded tunnel? Rope bridge? Check, it's all here.The McGuffin is a little underdeveloped (so were the letters of transit in Casablanca), Indy's hat doesn't always look as good as it does in the other three movies (especially Raiders and Crystal Skull), and all the cliffhangers are stolen from Zorro's Fighting Legion (steal from the best, babe).

So I started with the Temple of Doom. And it was so magic, I was completely amazed! I remember everything, it changed my life forever.

The teaser and trailers for the film and a documentary I saw on the History Channel about the Ark tell me to rewatch it, and I will. I wonder if Kingdom of the Crystal Skull's gonna be better than this.I thought Temple of Doom was real fun, and it was thrilling, and it never ever got boring. When it wasn't exciting, it was funny, and I like that. This is one example of things I look for when I watch a film. One scene that I love is where Willie falls off a elephant, cryin' and moans about life in Shanghai. That was really funny.

This film definitely took a page from Star Wars Empire Strikes Back in that the film is a lot darker than the first but it never loses its core values which is what made me fall in love with the original. There's action, comedy and adventure that follows the same formula from the Lost Ark but the filmmakers still manage to deliver it with originality that leaves you wanting more.

390,Anaisnine,A character in search of a story.,6,3 December 2011,"You are Steve Spielberg and George Lucas. You have created one of the best made films of all time. You have created a box office bonanza. You have created one of the most iconic movie characters of all time.What do you do? How do you follow it up? All too often we see filmmakers fall into the deadly sequel trap, this trap of course being ""take the elements and scenes the public really responded to in the first film, and ramp it up to 11""Invariably, this approach always fails. Why does it always fail? Because this strategy is often pursued at the expense of the most important element of all- character development and a coherent story, which are the elements that made the original as successful as it was in the first place. From the first scene of Raiders the character of Indy is carefully unfolded before us- he is a man who is driven, resourceful, intelligent, and not afraid of a good fight. But he is also has his weak spots( fear of snakes, which isn't even a weak spot because it enhances his character by showing he has some vulnerabilities) and can be a bad judge of character( the underling who double crosses him in the first 10 min of Raiders). These elements are developed and built upon as the story unfolds.As for the story, again it is laid out carefully. We have Indiana's rivalry with Belloq who is Indiana's cynical foil, his willingness to fight against evil by seeking the Ark to foil the Nazis, his past relationship with Marion, and the unveiling mystery surrounding the ark. All of this is done in a balanced and measured way.The characterization of Indiana and the other major characters is balanced with the telling of the story. Do we learn all of the backstory for each major character? No, but we learn enough about them to make them fully fleshed and compelling. Belloq is amoral and greedy, but like Jones he does have a love for knowledge and values artifacts, also he does at least feel human compassion for Marion- a tough nut, a woman who can fight her own battles and as the movies goes on you can see why a man like Indy fell for her. Sallah is a loyal friend to Indy with whom we can infer he has had some previous adventures. Raiders was a great balance of characterization, story, plot, great action sequences, amazing FX and an iconic score. All combining to make one of the best movies of all time.Sadly, Temple sacrificed the characterization and plot and just decides to make this simple one big action sequence with some gross out sequences to pander to the kids- Temple really went of the way to pander to the child audience( the character of short round, the plot of kids needing to be rescued, gross out moments etc). Was this an attempt to increase merchandising sales? I do not know. Even more disturbing, Indy's ""love interest"" this time around is more a caricature of the damsel in distress rather than a fully fleshed out character. We are not given insight into the motivations or desires of the villains other than they are Eeeeeevell. In the other words, the villains are just stock wooden characters there to be defeated by Indiana. Granted, its hard to create a better villain than Nazis, but at least Belloq had some charm and style. But the most disappointing aspect of this sequel is..we don't learn anything new about Indiana. How did he become the man we saw in Raiders? Given that the film is set a year before the events of Raiders, it was a perfect opportunity to show some of the events that lead to Henry Jones jr becoming Indiana Jones. But in this film, we are given nothing to add to the aura or mystique of Jones, nothing to illuminate other facets of his character or his relationships that existed by the beginning of Raiders.Some said the movie failed because it was too dark, or too violent or too gross and too much action. The movie failed because despite having a fantastic character to base the movie upon, it failed to tell the story of that character.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Don't get me wrong, though. This is a very well made a movie. It's just a very dumb movie. This is an example of 2 things being mutually exclusive.

394,tylerwoodrownichols,Does not deserve the hate,9,28 September 2020,"I think Temple of Doom was the very first Indiana Jones films I saw as a child, and I've seen it more times than its companion films. While it's not quite as good as Raiders of the Lost Arc (A true 10/10 IMO), that says more about the quality of the original than it does about issues with this one. It has only recently come to my attention that many within the Indy fandom regard TOD as a bad movie, which really surprised me. Since I hadn't seen it since I was a teenager and am now in my 30s, I decided to watch it on Netflix last night to see if my perception of it had soured with age. But I really loved every second of it! It's an action-packed, entertaining, pulpy adventure film with memorable characters and a great blend of suspense, humor, and even horror. What more could I ask for?I feel bad for the character of Willie, and even worse for Kate Capshaw. I see so many reviewers attack her for ""terrible acting"", when what they really mean is they don't like the way the character was written. There's nothing wrong with her acting, she just had to work with what she was given. I think Willie is just a badly misunderstood character who doesn't deserve the vitriol she receives. The whole point of her character was that she was out of her element and, unlike Marion, was not a seasoned adventurer. This made her a foil to Indy and Short, and her presence helped set up many of the more memorable comedic moments of the film. I guess whether or not she's ""annoying"" is a matter of personal taste, but I just found her to be more cute than anything. While Marion was the best, I prefer Willie to the Nazi girl in The Last Crusade... who was basically devoid of anything resembling a personality.I love the character of Short... he just feels so quintessentially ""80s"" to me. Yes, a lot of the things he does are utterly ridiculous, but I like what he brings to the table. It's a shame he didn't appear in any of the other films, not even for a brief cameo or something.Now, onto the ""problematic"" aspects of TOD... If you are personally offended by this movie, I can't really argue against that because it's understandable. I 100% agree that some elements of the plot and characterization of Chinese/Indian people hasn't aged well and is in some ways feels racist. Anyone who knows anything about Hinduism or the god Siva will tell you that the entire premise of this murderous Thugee cult making human sacrifices to Siva makes literally no sense. It feels like that plot element was more inspired by ancient Mesoamerican cultures than Indian religions. Same with when the child sultan is using what appears to be a voodoo doll on Indy... that doesn't really add up either. The gross-out dinner scene where Indians are depicted as savages who eat live snakes, eyeball soup, and chilled monkey brains has no basis in reality... especially when you consider that Hinduism is closely associated with vegetarianism. And finally, the whole framing narrative of Indy being the 'chosen one' to rescue the village of brown people is a perfect example of the ""white savior trope"".However, at the end of the day I know that this work of fiction was inspired by pulp novels from the early-20th Century... and yeah, this kind of ""othering"" of ""exotic"" cultures kind of comes with the territory. I can only speak for myself, but the way these groups are depicted in this film has not influenced my perception of these cultures whatsoever. I have known plenty of actual Indian people and I know damn well this isn't an accurate portrait of how they live. I prefer to view it as a document of a by-gone era, where Westerners viewed foreign civilizations with a confusing blend of mysticism and fear. So while these features could easily form the basis for a PhD thesis, I personally find enough entertainment value and light-heartedness in the rest of the film to justify loving this film.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

396,karthik-globalsoul,Awesome flick for wit and fast paced action,9,22 February 2008,"(Karthik Narayan)George Lucas's dream superhero appears in yet another thriller of a movie. This is the second movie in the sequel to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". This movie series has enthralled and enamored audiences worldwide for its breakneck speed of action, comedy and witty dialogues all packed in a short, crisp way.Harrison Ford has his slick ways and punny ways of doing things, living life dangerously in the fast lane as Indiana Jones. This time, Indy lands himself a beautiful lead-actress for that touch of glamour (frankly, it wasn't required at all). As they meet, they go through dangers that lurk in the shadows and they are chased all the way to India. There, they meet a prince en route to their quest for a sacred stone and the missing children of a nearby village, and confront his witchdoctor, who salvage* Ma Kali's blessings through human sacrifices. Amrish Puri has given a brilliant performance as Mola Ram  he looks fierce and fits the bill as a witchdoctor in India. I guess some people outperform themselves in certain roles  Amrish Puri's Mola Ram will go down in history as one of the finest villains ever. There is one scene (amongst many others) where he exclaims: ""Kali Ma protects us! We are her children! We pledge our devotion to her with an offering of flesh... and blood!""  this scared the wits out of me!The little prince provides a dangerous proposition for the viewers  whether to admonish his brash and evil acts or to adopt his cute looks. Indiana's little sidekick Short Round (Jonathan Ke Quan) steals our hearts with his acting.There are some moments when Indians are shown in poor light  this is where Lucas really stumps us, after all that hype of his adopting Hinduism for his Star Wars sagas. Maybe he was making amends later in Star Wars! But he could have done away with those morbid scenes, and surely, there was no need for the lead actress at all.Tantric, mystic and terrific scenes smolder each one of us in terror and delight of fine cinema, sans modern moments of cell phones and weapons of mass destruction. Here man faces man in dark moments of hypnotism. The special effects are awesome, and that too for a movie made in the timeline of the early 1980s (1984 to be exact)Sacrilege to those who cannot stick to this storyline! You are doomed to be glued to your seats in this gripping tale of dripping sweat and blood and the final triumph of good over bad",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
397,ashboomstick-50540,"Temple of Doom 1984 Review: A Solid Entry In The Series, But Not As Good As the First",8,5 September 2018,"There are diverse opinions as to whether or not the second entry in the Indiana Jones Series is any good. Some say that Temple of Doom doesn't feature any decent chracters, and is too brutal and distasteful for the liking of young children. That may be true, but it is also worthy of a good watch, because there are several fantastic aspects to the film. Many directors have the option to use exotic settings to give their movie a bit of style, some use too much (this is called style over substance), but when used correctly, exotic settings can make a movie more entertaining. In the case of Temple of Doom, the exotic location only helps the film, as Pankok Palace, (the exotic location) is introduced in the second half of the film, after a somewhat slow start. Not that the beginning of the film is bad, but in comparison, the second half (in my opinion) is much better.While many critics argue that Temple of Doom isn't a great film, no one can argue that the movie expanded the film industry in a time period where the industry needed much reviving. These parts of the film only make the movie greater.1. It basically invented the PG-13 Rating
Because of the films disturbing violence and gore, studio executives determined that the film was too violent for young children, but not disturbing enough that teenagers couldn't watch it. Therefore, they can up with the PG-13 rating and re-rated it years later. This was a great thing for the film industry, because as a result of this film and Gremlins, (both films Spielberg collaborated on) films had more variety in subsequent years.2. The offscreen relationship between Spielberg, Capshaw and Harrison Ford led to greater performances
During the filming of Temple of Doom, Spielberg became quite enamoured with Capshaw, who had a major role in the film. Years later, they were happily married, and still are married to this day. Even if some viewers don't like the film, one has to appreciate the fact that Temple of Doom intertwined two lively souls. To this day, they are possibly the greatest and humblest celebrities, and it's all thanks to Temple of Doom.3. It officially made Indy an indestructible hero
By the end of the film, Indy and his gang have been through a multitude of horrid situations. Every single obstacle that they face, Indy gets them out of. Even after he's been tortured endlessly and possessed, in the end, Indy saves the day, which should make any viewer happy and a bit tearful. Overall, is Temple of Doom better than Raiders of The Lost Ark? Absolutely not! But does it offer another great entry with awesome special effects, great characters, and a surprising amount of humor? Yes! That's good enough for me.Temple of Doom=89%
-5 points taken off for being overly melodramatic and silly with it's characters
-5 points taken off for not deciding on a clear tone and mood
-1 point taken off for having irritating characters, who don't have backstories",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
398,kevcom,Pathetic follow-up,3,10 May 2007,"Aside from the ""let's gross out the audience as much as possible"" factor, Kate Capshaw couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Her performance is painful to watch, but not quite as annoying as that obnoxious kid.The raft falling out of the plane scene will likely go down in history as the worst, and most unbelievable ""special effect"" ever committed to celluloid. Even way back in 1984, that scene (along with several others) was just too stupid to believe.""Raiders"" was a great flick, and ""Last Crusade"" was okay.

399,Liu-icc,old great movie,8,16 June 2020,The first adventure movie i watched on tv . i was excited about this movie.,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
400,thomasellery,I'm not the kid who loved this anymore!,6,20 November 2020,"Temple of Doom was one of my favourite films when I was kid and I'd happily watch my VHS recording of it time and time again whilst jumping all over the sofa pretending to be Dr Jones himself.Having not seen the film for about 20 years a revisit to the Temple wasn't really that great an adventure.The plot paces along nicely, the action sequences are entertaining, although now as an adult seem absolutely ludicrous in terms of realistically being able to survive any of them, and the maturer me definitely noticed how handsome a man Harrison is.But..... in 2020 eyes it's a bit of a shocker of how non western culture is represented here, with its mish mash of other cultures passed off as Indian and the wrong Gods used in the wrong context. It's vintage tales of a western explorer in a pulp fiction way yes, but they really should have got the cultural details correct.I'm not even that woke that I look for things that are offensive, but the inaccuracies and 'white saviour' is pretty obvious - however it was made in a time without internet and more culturally aware world so fact checking wasn't even a consideration back then for most of the audience.If you watch it as a kid, as an epic adventure in 'somewhere' as opposed to 'India' then this will be awesome film. If you're in your mid 40's it's a fun nostalgic trip but it's definitely the more campy outing of Dr Jones - and Kate Capshaw did a great job with the material she was given, so blame the writers for making her character kind of annoying.Ultimately it's a movie for 10 year olds. Some may think it's a little bit gory for them, but most 10 year olds will disagree with you on that one.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
401,MovieMaster95,"If Classic Has A Name, It's Temple Of Doom",10,10 October 2010,"An underrated gem of the 80's, An adventure not to be missed and indescribably classic in every sense of the word. I'm a huge fan of the Indiana Jones franchise and unlike most fans, consider Temple of Doom to be my favourite of the series and one of my favourite films.Set one year before Raiders(In 1935), Temple of Doom's plot doesn't revolve around the Nazis and takes a darker root. This time Indiana teams up with a club singer named Willie and ten year old, Asian boy named Short Round. After a treasure deal goes wrong the three escape in a plane which turns out to be a trap, causing them to do a death defying escape which ends up in India. When the village people their warn them of the mysterious temple and the horrible loss of their children, the three set off to discover the temple. The plot just gets darker and more action packed from there.Harrison Ford returns in his signature role as Indina Jones and is still the tough as nails archaeologist he was in Raiders. Short Round is a lovable and has great chemistry with Indy, and during the film he becomes one of the most memorable sidekicks ever. Willie, is a typical damsel in distress, who spends the movie screaming and moaning, but this is just a throwback to the 'B' movies, the Indiana Jones films are inspired by.From start to finish the film is filled with tons of memorable moments, classic set-pieces and amazing stunt and camera work. With a snow ball pacing that gradually gets bigger and better as it goes along, the movie is pretty much impossible not to enjoy. The score is one of the best I've heard in a film a mixed with the creative and memorable camera work, just makes the film even better and gives me chills every time.I can't stress this enough, but Temple of Doom is a must see for any fan of film. Some say it's too dark (Heart Scene)and the sillier moments ruined it(Dinner Scene), but the experience for me was never spoilt and the dark moments just made it better. With a bigger 'B' movie feel, great action, amazing set-pieces and effects and timeless feel the film gets my highest recommendation. Not to be missed!",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
402,caricatunssss,The worst classic Indiana jones film,6,25 March 2019,"And even with that... is still a pretty entertaining film. My problem with Temple of doom is that is has an annoying main cast. Willie is yelling all the time and is very frustrating to watch and Short round doesn't have any kind of personality. Also, the film is extremely disturbing and dark without any particular reason, it isn't a bad thing but it feels kind of unnecessary. The worst part of the film is the ending, it's solution is EXTREMELY convenient, and feels kind of lackluster. Even with that, i can't hate this film. Temple of doom has some GREAT action scenes and Indiana Jones' personality is great as always. If you look for a good plot, this movie isn't good, but if you look for some simple and fun action, this movie is a masterpiece.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
403,Stenian,"Suspenseful, riveting, gripping and tastefully dark.",8,24 November 2020,"The first film was good, but it just felt lacking and neither here or there. The Temple of Doom seemed to have filled those gaps. It hit the right notes and I felt very satisfied at the end. For an early 1980s films, it still holds up and it still remains to be one of the most exciting films I've ever watched. Roger Ebert was right to call this ""the greatest Bruised Forearm Movie ever made"" due to how exciting and thrilling it is, where it will leave your body bruised for being glued to the couch. It felt like a high-octane, adrenaline-rushing action-thriller rather than a pure adventure film. But still, the adventure was there alright.The film starts like a rollercoaster ride, with a moderate pace and then it gets faster, more exhilarating and then we reach a breath-taking climax. Whilst some people disliked the dark themes (which involved child labour and frightening sacrifice scenes), I myself enjoyed them pretty much and thought they gave the film a mature, realistic and fresh tone. Otherwise, it would've been another ""Raiders"". Speaking of dark and brutal, the villains in this film made those in ""Raiders"" look all cartoony and Disney-ish in comparison.The characters were all very enjoyable and likable. I usually find kids and sidekicks in films to be annoying and superfluous, but Short Round was very likable and he did not bother me one bit. I thought Willie Scott was a better love interest and character than Marion, who seemed like a try-hard in all honesty. Sure, she was a bit too fidgety and slightly annoying, but I actually liked her.The exotic location, of India, was one of the best features of this film. John William's score really gave life to the environment with the beautiful theme music for the Indian setting, and as well for the suspenseful scenes. The film felt like ""Alice In Wonderland"", with characters going through perilous holes and menacing tunnels into an underground temple (below the Pankot Palace), where all the darkness and magic occurs. This gave the film a distinct and interesting concept. Totally different from the first film and as well as ""Crusade"", which tastelessly had scenes set in many places in the world.Again, a really fun and entertaining movie. I'd count it as an epic film, but that's debatable. You don't need to watch the others to enjoy this one. It can easily be a standalone film and can be relished on its own right.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
404,Faena,A Pinnacle of Pulp Fantasy,9,25 October 2003,"While the story may not be as sophisticated as The Last Crusade, Temple of Doom is a superior Indiana Jones film. It's not quite Raiders, but Temple shares a visceral energy that Crusade lacks. Indiana Jones is a lean, mean, ass-kicking machine in this flick. When he slugs the first Thuggee before liberating the slave children, sending him sliding across the gravel, I could just cry, it's that good.Short Round is an excellent sidekick, and Spielberg superbly mines the mock father-son relationship between this character and Indiana Jones in the film's scarce but effective heartwarming scenes. I'm in the minority here, but I think Kate Capshaw is great as the the effervescent Willie Scott. Who says all female characters have to be fearless, ass-bashing kung fu masters or briefcase-toting lawyers? Willie is *supposed* to get on your nerves.The production is lavish, from the Shanghai nightclub dance number to the gorgeous Indian palace. John Williams' score doesn't have a single dull note, and is an undeniable masterpiece. Sadly, it was criticized for being over the top, like the other aspects of the film.The Temple of Doom serves as a pinnacle of pulp fantasy. Cinematically, it's better than Crusade, which isn't to say Crusade is bad, it's very very good. But it lacks a certain Spielbergian vitality that's on display here.Quite simply, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is one of the most deftly crafted adventure films, ever.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Also, it is overtly dependent on the threat of violence to children--much like Jurassic Park, another Spielberg movie I have trouble enjoying for the same reason--but at least Jurassic Park has those amazing dinosaur special effects; Temple of Doom is mostly just a big gross-out, with way too much screaming and not enough fun.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Of course everybody always rates the first movie in a trilogy the best - like Godfather I and Star Wars(the original 1977 movie), but clearly the films that followed them were better, as is the case with this one. I saw this film about 20 times as a kid and have recently watched all 3 movies again, enjoying this one the best.

Kate Capshaw's character, Willie, can get really annoying at some points. There's a whole scene dedicated to her freaking out about animals in the jungle... it's incredibly stupid. It seems as if her character has little to no purpose in the story. Really, you could have left her in Shanghai at the beginning of the movie and I bet the movie would actually be a little better. But, putting that aside, it is a very enjoyable movie. Seeing Indy back going on another classic adventure is great fun (The Mine Cart Chase Sequence is one of the best action scenes ever filmed).

The plot crosses the line from good yarn into fantasy, the mistakes they make whilst revealing their lack of knowledge about South Asia would horrify anyone less geographically challenged, & the naive way they make a Shanghai street urchin (whose language would make him more at home in Hong Kong) so devoted to American culture. barely acceptable in a kids picture but in a film whose rating makes it unviewable to most kids, no. The fact that Kate Capshaw had to beat over 100 other actresses to get this role makes me dread to think what the others were like! (I still remember her fake-fluent Japanese in 'Black Rain'!) However, even the best of directors have their weaknesses; Clint Eastwood had Sandra Locke & this film 'introdcuced us to the future Mrs Spielberg.

413,Megabuck,What a disappointment: Indiana Jones and the Overblown Sequel,5,26 February 2004,"Temple of Doom is, by some distance, the weakest of the three Indiana Jones films. The plot isn't inherently bad, but the characters are almost all weakly drawn, deeply irritating or both, and the action sequences feel lame.The bad news starts from the first frame. Raiders of the Lost Ark has one of the best opening sequences in cinema history; it establishes Jones as a swashbuckling archaeologist, and also brings in his enmity with Belloq. By contrast, the Temple sequence is embarrassing; is it a musical? Comedy? Parody? Frightening? It tries for all the above, and unsurprisingly just comes across as an awful mish-mash.Not even Jones' character works; he is supposedly exchanging a priceless relic for a fabulous diamond in the opening exchanges. That hardly fits with him being a voraciously acquisitive archaeologist. Had it been him offering the diamond, then it might have worked.Most others have commented on the startling annoyance levels achieved by Kate Capshaw's character, so I won't comment further beyond agreeing with them. But also, there's no on-screen chemistry with Harrison Ford. The first night in Pankot Palace, the two seem to go from barely tolerating each other to being ready to jump into bed with each other, for no discernible reason.From there, the film descends to a non-stop underground action sequence that occupies the rest of the film. This not only tries the audience's patience, but also their credulity; the mine cars chase is, on several levels, impossible. The cars are unpowered, yet get up to high speeds. This is fine, if the track goes steeply downhill, but it looks level. Then, after getting a good headstart, Jones' car is caught by two chasing cars. How the other cars go faster, with all of them relying on gravity, isn't explained. There are two parallel tracks, built across a wide-open chasm of molten lava; why there are two tracks here but not elsewhere, and how the tracks got there, aren't explained. Finally the tracks end, a tidal wave of water punches its way out, and we see they are near the top of a cliff - so the tunnels leading downhill come out high up? And there's a pool of lava in the middle of a cliff? Stop worrying, give up and accept that when they were plotting all this, logical consistency wasn't high on the agenda.You can only imagine the decision-making that went on at the studios. ""Raiders has been a huge success - what shall we give 'em in the sequel? More! More stunts! More action! More locations! More gross-out stuff!""

For so long this movie was my favourite of the franchise. The action packed nature of it was always it's main appeal but watching it now - in it's uncut blu ray guise for the first time in 36 years - it's only been available as a PG certificate film in the UK for all this time, with the extended heart ripping scene among others, this movie is still just utterly outrageous from start to finish. Objectively this is nearly as bad as the 4th movie (that doesn't exist) but it somehow manages to be so much more than the sum of it's parts. This film is, quite literally a roller-coaster ride from start to finish with just an onslaught of inventive action scenes.The thing is, despite how good it is, and it is really really good, it just can't top the original, and to be honest, nothing really can. Raiders just felt more realistic, more gritty somehow. The violence in it was just more brutal, the premise more grounded in reality.Temple of doom is an outstanding blockbuster but it's just not quite as iconic as raiders, it's completely over the top in parts and it shows all these years later. Even the third one, whilst being almost a remake of the original comes off as more credible than this.Yet despite this, this movie manages to one of the very best cinema experiences of the 80s (and I saw this on the big screen in 1984), and in a lot of ways is better than the last crusade - which is also better than doom in a lot of ways also.Really this film is a bit of an enigma.

Temple of Doom is the classic action movie, probably only second to Aliens (1986)!  No matter how many times I watch it, it never gets old...

420,robfwalter,There's so much happening and none of it is interesting!,4,14 March 2019,"How does a movie with so much action manage to be so boring? The answer is by having two unlikeable main characters and no sense of what is at stake in any scene. This is clearly established in the opening credits, which show a song-and-dance number that is not very good and goes on too long. When that reaches its merciful conclusion, there is then a long sequence when Indiana tries to conduct the handover of a stolen artefact in exchange for a diamond. Given that he's trading in stolen antiquities, at this point the only reason a viewer would know that Indiana Jones is our hero is that he's the only white man in the room. He gets poisoned, but of course the vial of antidote gets knocked to the floor so there is another overlong sequence in which I failed to care whether Indi picked up the vial or died a painful death. While this mercenary is trying to save his own life, the singer from the earlier scene is also trying to pick up a diamond which fell on the floor. So far the only things we've learnt about her is that she's not a great performer and, like Dr Jones, she's fairly unpleasant. Now we're fifteen minutes into the movie and it has mostly been about awful people trying to pick up things from the floor.A normal action movie would slow down at this point, allowing the viewer to catch their breath and giving the characters a chance to develop further. No such luck, however, as there's a plane crash and some whitewater rafting before the plot is hastily set in motion with a missing stone. I promise I'll stop itemising the events of the film, but I do want to quickly point out that there follows a treacherous elephant ride, through the depths of the jungle, to a castle which it turns out is sufficiently easily accessible to have British troops visiting. Why don't they just go the easy way? During this journey we find out that the female character, I can't remember whether we'd been told her name at this point, moron as well as being selfish, rude and overly sensitive.This is just how the movie proceeds, with one event following the last and no change in the stakes. It is always life-or-death, no one ever seems to take it seriously and the next thing may or may not be related to the last.The action is mostly fairly well done, so there's still some entertainment to be had, but as a whole, this movie doesn't cohere at all and suffers considerably for that reason.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

The depiction of Indian dishes such as baby snakes, eyeball soup, beetles and chilled monkey brains are ridiculous in the country where majority are vegetarians. in a dialogue where villain says Kali ma will take over Muslim Jews Christian god in the world were made to look like Hindus are evil people. depiction of the goddess Kali as a representative of the underworld and evil was met with much criticism, as she is almost exclusively depicted as a goddess of change and empowerment (Shakti), meaning that while she does destroy, she almost always does so in order to affect positive change. showing the things wrongly will sure offend everyone.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

426,dane11,Temple of Overkill,4,1 June 2004,"I remember after Raiders of the Lost Ark came out my friends and I were all waiting for a sequel.  There was no doubt in our minds that the team of Spielberg, Lucas and Ford would return again to give us another rousing adventure in the form of Indiana Jones!  We waited three years only to find that the sequel wasn't even close to the original in its craftsmanship, story-telling and overall adventure.  What Raiders gave the audience was a classic story of good vs. evil with a charming, believable hero who defied odds and came out on top because he was fighting for the good and just cause.  With Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones seems to step from his archeologist's leather coat and into a James Bond Astin Martin.  He's suddenly not so fallible as he was in the first movie. His rough edge is gone and Indiana Jones seems a bit smoother and more refined.  In this one he's more assured and no matter what trials and perils he faces he readily has an answer.  And the trials and perils he faces are many and way over the top!From jumping out of window, with a nightclub singer in tow, crashing down through awnings and into the backseat of a waiting car we know right away that our hero is something out of the ordinary.  From there we follow him on an airplane ride (reminiscent of the Lost Horizon) where the pilots abandon our hero and his cohorts.  As the plane goes down they jump out in a life raft and take a toboggan ride that puts the scariest Disney rides to shame! This is how the movie goes, one daredevil stunt after another after another with a bevy of gross bugs and dinners with eyeballs in them thrown in so the audience never really feels at ease.This is what I hate about sequels! They (directors, producers and actors) want to top everything in the original movie and so they do complete overkill of all that made the first movie a success.  Spielberg once claimed that he wished he had made Jaws 2 as he thought he could have done justice to the shark.  But viewing this movie, I don't see how Spielberg would've saved the shark from its campy fate.  Temple of Doom is just too far-fetched and too campy for it's own good.  Everything seems forced in this movie: From Indy's sidekick ""Short round"", to the evil, heart-eating witch doctor to the romance between Indy and the nightclub singer 'Willie' Scott, adequately portrayed by the soon to be Mrs. Spielberg, Kate Capshaw. Everyone in the movie seems as though they are trying their hardest to act, sing, be heroic, scream, menace, be evil, or just be silly.  It all ends up being cartoon-ish which is far from what attracted us all to the first Indiana Jones movie.The trio of Spielberg, Lucas and Ford would later re-unite (and redeem themselves) to make Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.  Sequels don't need to be over the top to be successful.  Usually, they just need a good story and a good team in front of and behind the camera.  Lucas has done it numerous times now with the Star Wars series.  Maybe it's just too easy to overkill a story, laden it with incredible stunts, cheesy plot points and extraneous characters.  I don't fault Spielberg, Lucas and Ford for making this movie.  I'm sure they thought they were giving us what we all were clamoring for.  Lucky for my friends and I we only had to wait another five years after Temple of Doom for the sequel we had been waiting for.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
427,evenbetter,Nazis aren's ALWAYS the bad guys...,10,8 November 2001,"Okay, it seems that most people who don't think this movie is all that great bring up the fact that Indiana Jones isn't killing Nazis in this one.  So what?  It's easy to know who the bad guys are in RAIDERS and CRUSADE: they're Nazis!  And come on; they're satan-worshiping cultists, it doesn't take a genius to know their BAD GUYS!  This movie definitly requires more brains, and more heart, than the other Indys.  Some excellent scenes: the mine-cart chase; Indy's brawl between the Head Slavemaster; cutting the bridge; and the classic opening sequence.  I suggest you go out a rent this movie, and make your own judgements about it.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
428,evenbetter,Jumping off the bandwagon,10,17 January 2003,"Most of the comments I see regarding Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are negative.Why?I think the answer is obvious: most people couldn't care less because it's the middle child; that is, it doesn't have the force of the first, or the luster of the last.  I can't see how anyone could dismiss Temple of Doom as the worst of the series (point of fact, I think Raiders takes this honor, but that's for another Comment).Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom raises more social questions, challenges viewers to experience raw emotions, and casts Dr. Jones in a herioc and human light.  Most people, I think, put down Temple because Indiana isn't fighting Nazis - the quintessential cinema badguy - instead he is up against enemies more personally sinister to Indy; sinister in that Mola Ram, the leader, doesn't threaten the Free World but the lives of a small Indian town as well as Indy himself.  Indeed, the only misgivings Dr. Jones reveals about the Third Reich is ""Nazis; I hate these guys.""Everyone complains, ""This isn't Indiana Jones!"" or ""He isn't like that!"" Well, with all due respect, how do you know his true character?  And more so, who are you to claim knowledge of Indy's moral struggles?  Spielberg and Lucas have the only claim to this right.  And it was up to them to explore Indiana Jones' motivations, past, and tell a rousing adventure at the same time.  They succeeded, naturally, yet many refuse to accept this chapter in Indy's life as legitimate.  Temple was supposed to be a *true* adventure; that is, the hero is tested physically, mentally, and spirtually in an environment that is alien and challenging.  In Temple we see Indy overcome his most awesome obstacles, not the least of which is the famous ""Bridge Standoff.""The production quality is higher, the story goes for the jugular, the effects are more polished, Harrison Ford is at his best, we see Dr. Jones in a fight for surival (as well as an *unselfish* quest, read: not for a museum), Indy's weaknessess are revealed, his darkside exposed, and his uncompromising heroism shines in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.As one Indy's last quotes in the movie, he says ""Yes, I see [the stone's] power now.""  Now ask yourself, why do you *really* disapprove of this movie, for it's very few shortcomings or because it's simply not Raiders or Crusade.  That's all I ask; you'll Temple so much more if you take it as a rousing adventure with a moral.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
429,chadly86,A good Saturday afternoon flick,7,19 July 2001,"I am a huge Indiana Jones fan; I bet I've watched the three films at least a dozen times each.  What makes me come back and be thrilled time and time again is the use of imagery, the quality of acting, the thrill of suspense, and the sparking of imagination.This prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark is very similar to The Empire Strikes Back in its tone...they are dark, mysterious, and much more subtle than their counterparts.  Doom is a good film, but not anywhere close to Empire or to the other films of the Indiana Jones trilogy.  Why?  Because it simply was too different from the original.  I saw Indiana Jones in two different ways with two different films.  Mainly, this is because he had a different female partner...two completely different characters as well. Even more importantly, he was fighting two different enemies, and as a result, it used two different ""archeaologoical finds.""It also lacked the story development that Raiders had.  Raiders' power was its ability to constantly and convincingly bring action to the screen. This film lacked that style, and it hurt itself as a result.Honestly, I found this film too dark as well.  Perhaps I'm expecting too much of a ""good-feel"" out of this film, but that is what this genre is all about, I think.Kate Capshaw did a decent job as Willie, but she at times was way too overdramatic.  She was the exception rather than the rule, however. Harrison Ford gave his usual quiet, but awfully convincing performance. Ford's gift as an actor is to not over-emphasize.  This film could let him get away with that, but he still chose not to.  It made his performance so much better.There were other bright spots...the enemy was well-defined and was well-presented as ominous and completely convincing.  In a good-vs.-evil genre, this film made it easy to distinguish between the two.  The story itself was very easy to followThe special effects, which were somewhat unrealistic, still added rather than subtracted from the film.  The music by John Williams was also excellent.  The opening scenes were by far the best of the movie and very classic in style.  This movie got your interest immediately.  The most important thing:  This film is complete entertainment.  Not once did I feel bored.This film fulfills its basic function:  to entertain, to thrill, and to provoke imagination.  In this mode, it is a success.  However, compared to the other two Jones films, this film is a bit of a disappointment.  But it is guaranteed to be entertaining, and for that reason, I recommend it.7/10",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

It is obvious why the series is so beloved; it has non-stop action and is the embodiment of the perfect 'family' movie. Of course, not all of them are masterpieces. While the first one is exceptionally awesome, and the third one is incredible fun, the second one is well, kind of stupid. That is not to say it is bad, because it is not, but it pales in comparison to the first and third. (It's better than the 4th one, but to be honest, that's not very hard) While the pacing and tone of the first movie felt just right to the story, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom never really finds its rhythm, and feels like an unorganized mess because of it. Indiana's sidekicks consist of a woman who spends most of the movie screaming, and some Asian kid, who, if I'm, going to be completely honest, is simultaneously the most annoying and most fun character in the movie. Harrison Ford, who is a great actor, does not do much in this movie. While he was incredibly charismatic in the first movie, he just seems pissed off the entire movie. (Which makes sense, that woman really needs to stop screaming) However, I suppose I have to give this movie some points for being the reason PG-13 was invented.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

That little boy is even more annoying, he looks so fake, what a terrible actor this kid is...and the sequence where he was beating the crap out of 10 adult men is so stupid i almost laughed, actually i didnt know whether to laugh or cry. He also somehow always manages to ruin touching scenes with his stupid lines, same goes for the funny scenes, we dont actually need this brat to scream ""haha this is funny funny haha"" whenever a joke is told.

Actually, if this hadn't been part of a beloved trilogy -- if there was no Raiders and this had been released on its own merits -- I'm thinking box office as well as critical failure; certainly not a 7.6 on IMDb. So ""doesn't hold up"" probably isn't quite as accurate as ""never was very good."" This isn't a knock on the action set-pieces possible in the day, which are still fine, actually, but the story, the dialogue, the performances, it's all lacking; the lighthearted is just goofy, the dark is dark but not in any nuanced or interesting way. Just a lot of uninspired or poor decision making here. Where Raiders had a relatively cool heroine, Temple has the shrieking showgirl lost outside the city. Where Raiders went creepy-fun (spiders on the back, snake pit) Temple goes gross-out (snake surprise, insects thick as a carpet).

A damsel in constant distress, squealing and screaming! Being pretty is not enough. Mola Ram was a creepy villain for sure.Indy takes on the Thuggee Cult that has taken captive the children of a small village in India. If Indy gets the sacred Shankara stone back, all will be well. This is definitely a dark episode. A man's heart gets ripped out and children are enslaved. Lots of nasty bugs! There is some fun to be had though in Shanghai and the mine cart chase! The trio also jump out of an airplane on a blowup raft! Indy really gets to use his signature whip here which is a plus! He also has another fight with a huge henchman played by Pat Roach, the same guy who played the huge Nazi that gets shredded by propellers in RAIDERS.TEMPLE OF DOOM is not as good as the other entries but that doesn't mean it's completely terrible.

What else was there to do in the summer but anticipate the new blockbuster that everyone was talking about?But, unfortunately, as the years have passed, Temple of Doom has become unwatchable.  While both Raiders and Last Crusade both got by with suspending our beliefs while we immerse ourselves in fantasy, Temple of Doom did it through horrible continuity, sexism, and cheese.  Thank god it is not the trend for George Lucas, but it certainly seems to be for Kathleen Kennedy and Steve.When people approach me and ask, ""I'd like to be an annoying film 'nitpicker' like you!""  I tell them to start off with Temple of Doom.  The jump cut to cut ratio is higher in this film than any other I've ever seen. A great example of poor direction and even worse cinematography.  My apologies to veteran, Doug Slocombe.  I don't blame him.  Kathleen and Steve should have known better.The audio in this film, however, is stellar.  In the non-digital, ambience rooms as big as a GM factory, pre-ProTools age, the ADR is this film is all but invisible and the design would be top of the line even today.  The audio production smudged (while still not able to solve) the film's continuity and production errors beautifully.  Events not in the primary focus were still audible while not trampling on the foreground.  Hats off to Ben Burtt and his crew for salvaging this painful film.

443,gnu165,"The best in the series, despite what people say.",9,7 February 2000,"Temple of Doom may be darker and more violent than the other films, but this what keeps it from being formulaic, like Last Crusade.  The fact that Indy goes up against somebody besides the nazis is what seperates this from the other movies and makes it stand out.  Also Mola Ram is a much more convincing villain than any other in the series, both Belloch and Donovan rely on the nazis to do pretty much all their dirty work and have absolutely no chance of taking Indy in a one on one knock down dragout brawl.  Not only that they both seem to be minions of the nazis rather than actual bad men themselves.  Mola Ram not only is the leader of the Thugee but he actually has a chance of beating Indy in a fight.  Another thing that makes this movie the best is Harrison Ford's performance.  Just the part where he tells Willie that they are about to die is hillarious.

With just some easy changes to them, you would have a much better film. Indy is just as good and charming as ever. While that is the only big issue I have, it is a big enough one to drag the movie down.

449,George_Bailey,Docta Jones..your whip!,8,10 March 2000,"Although he still directs with the same power and style that he has always held steadily in his grip, Steven Spielberg doesn't quite capture the same magic in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom that he transfixed on and illuminated in the original Raiders of the Lost Ark. Despite it not being quite the calibur of its predecessor, The Temple of Doom is still an exciting and fun adventure with a familiar and already well-loved hero.Here our story begins with a madcap, high-wire sequence in which we're reintroduced to Indiana, his profession, and what he does best. We also meet Short Round, a young Asian boy who works for Indy, and a showgirl named Willie Scott who's gotten caught up in Dr.Jones' latest escapade. After a crazy scene involving a plummeting airplane and a flying inflatable raft, Indiana and his two compadres get involved in the problems of the local people, involving the brutal Thugee cult and a trio of mysterious and magical stones.Harrison Ford is once again great as Indiana Jones, but who doesn't fare too well here is Kate Capshaw as Willie. Unlike the strong-willed Marion, Willie is simply the bumbling comic relief, which not only makes for a poor character in the first place, but the fact that Capshaw as no comic talent whatsoever makes it even worse. The true break-out talent here is John Ke Quan as Short Round, Indy's buddy. Quan has great comedic timing, and his smart-mouthed, choppy-English Short Round is probably one of the best child performances ever. Who would have thought that giving Indiana Jones a kid sidekick would acually be a good idea?What does make Temple of Doom stand-out is its gory, extremely well-done action scenes, from thrilling mine cart chases to a fantastic stand-off on a stretching, collapsing bridge. This is what you are really come away remembering from this film.While it doesn't live up to its brother ROTLA, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a good-time for all, and if you're a fan of the original, you'll definately get a kick out of it.I give The Temple of Doom an 7 out of 10, and I'd recommend it to any fan of high-adventure and people who loved the original Raiders of the Lost Ark",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

There is enough entertainment and excitment in this film to delight any action fan. The thing that hurt this film so much is the so-so plot which involves our hero Indiana Jones taking on an evil cult to save a village located in India.Capshaw and Quan give good performances,which helps the movie stay healthy. I still say that there is no one else who could fit into the character of Indiana Jones as good as Harrison Ford. He is great.

451,Liljan-2,Very disappointing,1,21 February 2004,"Spoilers within.As has been pointed out by many previous reviewers, this is definitely the weakest movie in the Indiana Jones-trilogy. My major complaints are as follows:Willie - the heroine of the movie, played by Kate Capshaw - is a very annoying character, especially compared to Marion (Karen Allen), the leading lady in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Whereas Marion was tough, funny and courageous in addition to being stunningly beautiful, Willie comes across as a bimbo who is merely capable of screaming and whining. This gets tiresome at a very early point in the movie. Indiana's adolescent sidekick, young 'Shorty Round' (Jonathan Ke Quan), certainly has his moments too when it comes to being a nuisance. I was also amazed by the stupidity of the bad guys in the movie. In one of the finishing scenes, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is caught on a rope bridge between two columns of bandits who are approaching from the front and from behind. A least a couple of times, we (the audience) see him lifting his machete, apparently with the intention of cutting the ropes  and still we see the bandits approach undauntedly even though, in reality, this strategy should be as obvious to them as it is to us.There is also something very iffy about the way foreigners are portrayed in the movie. In 'Raiders', Indy's Egyptian friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) is just as clever and resourceful as Indy himself; in 'The Temple of Doom' all the Asian characters are portrayed as either pathetic victims, or as deranged murderers.

Not only does the homage to mid-century matinées continue, but so does the ignorance and xenophobia prevalent in those eras prevail with this movie in a way that was wonderfully absent in the excellent Raiders Of The Lost Ark. Whereas Raiders seems to have an appeal to a much wider audience, Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom aims squarely at the minds and eyes of those that smile during a massacre. The many insulting scenes of worship and later of Indian cuisine are to be taken lightly, only by those who are either not Hindi or Indian. The talent of Spielberg is just not on show here and for him to admit this and then to say that meeting Cate Capshaw was the only light is this mediocre work, explains much, particularly to his own fan-base. The cast suffer too. Cate Capshaw's role and script is second rate and despite Ke Quan's excellent verve, he cannot save this from revealing the laziness involved. All credit to the brilliant Spielberg for admitting as much. More than 20 years on we can see Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Team America. Here there is a film which manages to insult and be self effacing on different cultures at the same time. Lucas and Spielberg are the geeks before the the geeks that followed, but with Temple Of Doom they have more in common with Joel Schumacher and Michael Bay rather than Quentin Tarantino or Steven Soderbergh. Yes, their limitations are there for us to see should we chose to see them and in some cases be insulted by them. But it does also show that time is the strangest thing. The Raiders series have become exactly what they sought to honour and parody. That is for now they are dated dinosaurs which belong on the shelf alongside most of the James Bond series as purveyors of ignorance and cultural indifference. The only saving grace is that they, (Raiders Of The Lost Ark being the exception) are way too dim to have any lasting cinematically historical effect and so thereby save themselves from the 'classic' status afforded films that last the test of time.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
456,nahor88,A fun packed underrated movie.,9,6 June 2005,"This movie is definitely WAY underrated. Most of the people who have anything bad to say about it don't really have a good reason. The main derision that I have heard is that the stunts are too unrealistic, but honestly, all of the Indy stunts are like that. In Raiders of the Lost Ark, when Indy climbs under the truck, the stunts there were more unrealistic than any other. The storyline was fairly solid as was the acting. As for the villains, many of the antagonists minions were pretty weak I agree, but no less weak than the minions of the other Indy movies. As for the antagonist Mola Ram, he was definitely one of the best villains of the three movies. The only thing I really didn't like is how narrow-minded some of the Indian Culture was portrayed to be. I myself have been to India numerous times, and I can guarantee that no one there eats live snakes or monkey brains. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
457,zafarbg,Dark and Disturbing yet Underrated,8,17 November 2015,"This film is perhaps one of the darkest films to ever hit the silver screen.It's sole purpose was to create the PG-13 rating.But some elements save it from being a total disaster even though it's pretty dark for a film directed towards a family audience.However,it is commendable as a motion picture.The film opens in 1935, Shanghai, with Willie Scott,the film's female lead played by Kate Capshaw performing ""Anything Goes"".Indiana Jones arrives donning a White Tux ala Sean Connery in Goldfinger. What follows is a diamond pursuing fiasco and the introduction of Short Round, Indy's sidekick and the film's best supporting character.Even though the opening is the film's best sequence, the scenes in India where Indy meets the villagers and find out about the Sankara stones, which are the plot device, were particularly fine even though the Dinner scene is a nauseous yet hilarious one.The film then loses it's momentum after entering the second act, where we see that the main antagonist, Mola Ram is shown to be in possession of the stones and also the the infamous heart-ripping scene. Although the first hour was great, the second hour falls a bit flat with disturbing scenes of black magic.However,there are some standout sequences such as the cart chase and the bridge scene.There is no lack of humor in the third act.As for the performances, Harrison Ford, as always, was fantastic.Short Round was a great character, who Jonathan Quan played with charm.Willie ,however, wasn't much of a good female lead compared to Marion of the previous film due to the constant screaming but Kate Capshaw gave a good performance.Amrish Puri, as always, was menacing in his role.Overall, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is quite a enjoyable film despite it's flaws provided the Kali Ma sequences are either skipped or watched boldly.It's quite a underrated film and deserves much recognition.Grade-A- Score-8",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Certainly there are some entertaining and iconic moments in here which is unsurprising given the talent involved.However, it hasn't held up as well as I remembered and some of the criticism here seems justified to me.

464,malgreen,Shoddy acting and an outright insult to other people's beliefs,1,2 November 2005,"I seem to recall thoroughly enjoying the first Indiana Jones film, many years ago, and the last one with Sean Connery was also immensely entertaining, as I recall. So it was without any mixed feelings that I sat down to watch Temple of Doom. It got off to a bit of a shaky start, although the Busby Berkeley routine and the singer were all worth watching: something was a little too heavy-handed for my liking, or missing. What was it? After about ten minutes I realized that it was Harrison Ford, who really is a terrible, wooden actor. i was watching the film in English, having seen the other films dubbed in German by presumably skilled actors. What a difference! But even that (and the leading lady's appallingly silly role - nothing she could do about it I guess, that was the script), shouldn't have spoiled things. What now came was the tritest and offensive (truly offensive) pile of never-ending clichés about India I could ever have imagined. Not even clichés, but downright idiotic fantasies, such as Indian's eating monkey brains, performing voodoo, etc etc. And then the depiction of Kali, the protecting mother goddess in her ferocious aspect as a king of sub-Aztec monster took the biscuit. Sure, her cult has been abused, was indeed so by the historical Thugees, but Dr Jones should have shown a little more comprehension on these matters. Add to that the invocation of Sita and Ram - anything but nasty deities in the Hindu pantheon - in the demonic gibberish chanted by the Thugees and one wonders how Hollywood wasn't nuked. Sure, this kind of film doesn't live from method acting and stereotypes can be amusing, but if Spielberg wants to teach us respect to our neighbours he would do well not to go trampling about on other people's beliefs just to produce a blockbuster. Apart from which, I found the action sequences interminably boring, lacking the kind of build up and choreography which by You only live twice should have been standard. Maybe the underground trolley ride had its moments, and the bridge sequence could have been worse, but most of it was cluttered and strangely unmotivated. All in all I found this a really dismal bit of Hollywood propaganda for Western colonialism (note: there were only nasty fanatical Indians who we should despise, or the poor and helpless who need Western help - a very familiar Hollywood scheme).",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
465,TheManwithNoName_,"This movie doesn't get enough credit, the most underrated sequel of all time.",10,7 February 2015,"This is the dark prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark, there are way to many haters when it comes to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Sure, it has it's flaws and is by no means the strongest movie of the Indiana Jones series. Personally I love the whole classic trilogy and it's been a very important part of my childhood. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a awesome sequel, I don't know why people complain so much about it. It's easy to notice that each film is downright brilliant yet refreshingly different from each other. With Temple of Doom by the far the darkest in the series. This is an amazing adventure with jaw dropping action, brilliant sets and exotic locales, and a darker story than the first film. Harrison Ford gives an strong performance as Indiana Jones, the rugged, tough talking archaeologist. Ford got comfortable with the character in Raiders of The Lost Ark, he completely perfected the character in Temple of Doom. He is one of my favorite actors gives us the greatest characters in movie history. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round is lovable and has amazing chemistry with Harrison Ford, Short Round is probably my favorite sidekicks of all time. The leading lady, Willie, is a typical damsel in distress, who spends the movie screaming and complaining. John Williams' music is also at it's best. He even received an Academy Award nomination despite already being nominated for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film did win an Oscar for it's visual effects instead Ghostbusters won which, when viewed today, seem a little bit outdated, while Temple of Doom on the other hand looks just as good now as when it was released in 1984.

The characters are all, except Indiana Jones, annoying. (Especially that kid who alway yells ""Dr. Jones!"") Sometimes a stupid movie can redeem itself by refusing to take itself too seriously. Sadly this does not happen here. The presentation of the ""native tribe"" is really pathetic. Cliché and horribly dated, even for the 1980s.The action scenes are overly long, done before, and boring.

The only reason I gave it a 3 rating is because it isn't quite as painful to watch as the aforementioned Saturday Night Fever. The story seems like it was written by the movie's juvenile co-star. The pacing is uneven, the story unoriginal and just plain dull. I wish I could be witty and say that I wished Capshaw's character perished in the sacrifice scene, but I wish her character bit the bullet LONG before that scene. Someone shut her up! That incessant screaming that had the most irritating whiny quality. Who told her she could act? Oh, that's right, her boyfriend, Steven Spielberg. Capshaw's acting ability was non-existent. The kids having their revenge was the best part of the movie. Too little, too late. ""Then why did you keep watching?"" I didn't. I finally decided the noise of my neighbor's air conditioner was preferable. Some folks are saying this movie was really a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Who cares?

Written by American Graffiti's Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz and set in 1935 (making this film a prequel to the first film), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom takes its archaeologist hero (Harrison Ford) from a swank Shanghai night club to the rain forest of India as Indy, his orphaned sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) and his very reluctant companion Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw, who would later be Mrs. Steven Spielberg) go on a quest for an Indian village's sacred stone, which has been stolen by evil Thugee followers of the Kali cult. Indy is at first reluctant to go on this quest for yet another mythical artifact, but when the villagers tell the archaeologist and his two companions that the followers of Kali, now based in Pankot Palace, have stolen their children, Jones agrees to pay the new Maharajah of Pankot a visit. His interest is peaked when a dying young escapee arrives at the village and hands Indy a scrap of cloth with a fragment of tapestry. Reading its Sanskrit inscription and by looking at the pictographs on the cloth, Indiana discovers that the villagers' sacred stone is one of five Sankara stones, left to men by the Hindu god Shiva. When a puzzled Short Round asks Indy what a Sankara stone represents, the professor/adventurer replies, ""Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory."" But Indy's quest for ""fortune and glory"" takes a disturbing turn when the trio reaches Pankot Palace. The prime minister, Chattar Lal (Roshan Seth) appears to be just another Oxford-trained Indian bureaucrat, but in reality he's one of Kali priest Mola Ram's (Amrish Puri) lieutenants. Soon, Indy, Short Round and Willie go from honored guests to prisoners when they discover the goings-on behind the high walls of Pankot Palace. Although Temple of Doom is an enjoyable adventure film, its dark tones (both in storytelling and visual terms) and a few gory scenes involving a really gross banquet and a human sacrifice made it the least favorite entry in the series. And even though it was rated PG, the criticism Temple of Doom received caused director Spielberg to be one of the advocates of the PG-13 rating that the Motion Picture Association of America created within months of the film's release. Nevertheless, the film's action set pieces (some of them conceived for Raiders but left out for time constraints) are still thrilling, Spielberg's directing is top-notch and John Williams' 1930s-flavored musical score is, as always, brilliant. Although the other two films in the series are more fun and lighter in tone, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is still worth watching. Just not, of course, right after dinner.

First, is the ""Sophomore Curse"" in that the movie had to live up to the legacy of the first of the series... a daunting task if ever there was one!Secondly, this installment of the series just lacks a coherent story and script.  The jokes seem more forced, the characters more cardboard, and the the action sequences a little too much over the top, as if to compensate for the movies other failings.Lastly, and most importantly, is the very bad casting of Kate Capshaw (soon to be known as Mrs. Stephen Spielberg) as Indy's romantic interest.  There is ZERO screen chemistry here, and Kate Capshaw has to be perhaps the worst actress of this generation (Sondra Locke is perhaps the worst from the prior generation).  You just know that the ONLY reason she got this role was her association with Spielberg.  Every scene with her in it just doesn't feel right... and she's in just about every scene.Not a terrible movie... but it could have been so much better.

473,Nynaeve,Different than the other 2--but not entirely bad,5,3 November 1999,"Well, first of all, my perceptions of this movie are shadowed by the fact that it was one of my favorites when I was a kid (as in a lot of other posts), if not THE favorite from when I was 8 to 10, so I can't look at it the same way as if I had seen it for the first time as an adult.  As an adult, I would have been more aware of a weak script, absence of a good theme, somewhat offensive and stereotypical portrayal of the Indian villiage and of India itself, and filler gross-out material. Watching it recently, I was a little more put off by the one dimensional female sidekick than I was back then.  Why?  Because a nine year old can sympathize with the kind of squealing, self-absorbed, dependent nature that Willie portrays.  Now I just kind of wish she would have ""accidentally"" taken a fall off a cliff early in the movie. A 3 dimensional character would have shown at least a little development and competance.Nevertheless, a lot of what drew me in as a kid holds true.  The action is great, and fun even in repeated viewings. For those who say it's overkill-well, this is Steven Spielberg, not Merchant-Ivory. The scenery (which I'm a sucker for) is well done and along with the fantastic score (one of my favorite of John Williams'), creates a memorable atmosphere. I liked Short Round a lot.  And the theme, though not meaningful, was at least different from Raiders, which Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade unfortunately duplicated completely.  And it's main character is Indiana Jones, whom Harrison Ford carries off so well (and looks good doing it!) Indiana Jones succeeds so well because he's both a larger than life adventurer who everybody roots for but also has weaknesses enough to keep him from being boring.  And the fact that Indy is a different than in Raiders, greener and more inexperienced, emphasizing the fact that this is a PREQUEL, gives me a sense that the screenwriter wasn't a total hack.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
474,FMRadio,Not given enough credit,10,6 March 1999,"Let me begin by saying I own 3 movies and that's my entire library. And yes, all 3 are the Indiana Jones films. I idolized the character growing up and aspired to emulate him in every way. Save for the fear of snakes. Now, Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom was not the trend setting movie that Raiders of the Lost Ark was. Of course not... it came after. Some say the action was not as intense. I disagree whole-heartedly. I still find Raiders to drag on in parts and to be very slow paced, except for 4 scenes... the opening, the kidnapping, the escape and the climax. The one thing Raiders had over Temple was the climax. But not by much.Temple of Doom was far more ""fun."" It was genuinely funny & light-hearted to watch at many times. And yet, anyone with even a light case of arachnaphobia, claustrophobia, bogyphobia, pyrophobia acrophobia or a half dozen other phobias were scared to the edge of the seats (or out of the theatre) at various OTHER times. Overall, the action was non-stop with the occasional moment of brevity to lighten the mood and ease the tension before the action took off again. Much like riding up a slope in a mine cart with the anticipation that the scariest ride of a lifetime is coming once you reach the top.And yet, there was a great human side to this movie. Remember, this was the second in a series. And in a well-done series, there must be character development. And one certainly can't argue that we saw many different parts to Indy's character in Temple of Doom than the others. Also keep in mind that this movie was actually a prequel to Raiders so characters. Different time in Indy's life, different things to encounter.Where-as Raiders of the Lost Ark was a slow-paced action-adventure and Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade was a sentimental, human-focused adventure... Temple of Doom combined the best of both worlds for the most enjoyable two hours of the series. If you've never watched an Indiana Jones movie, watch this one first.

475,mviebuff,"This sequel, an inferior film... I think not!",10,22 March 1999,"Some people think that sequels are just another way to make money, and maybe they are. But just because it's a sequel doesn't mean it is a pointless movie. In my own opinion, I thought this was the best Indiana Jones film yet. I found the action sequences much more appealing and the comedic performances hilarious! Kate Kapshaw joins the cast in this brilliant film which is directed by her husband Steven Spielberg and is written by George Lucas. Kate plays Willie, a singing showgirl. She joins Harrison Ford (who reprises his role as archeologist Indiana Jones)in this film about searching for a tribes kidnapped children. She shows much comedic relief as her whiny character, and although some people find her irritating in her role I found that she was the one thing missing from the original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".In all the Joneses films, the opening sequences are always the most gripping part of the movie. In the original, Ford is searching for a historical statue in a booby-trapped cave. In the third, young Indy is pursued by a bunch of menacing men atop a circus train. But in this one he isn't just in one place. He is at first in a clubroom with a shoot out,and then escapes with Willie and Shorty (an annoying Japanese boy)onto a plane. Later before the plane crashes they escape on an inflatable boat, slide down a mountain and then land in rapids. If that is not action then what is?As you know, Indy hates snakes, and so do I. That could possibly be another reason why I like this one inparticular. There is only one scene with snakes (it's at a dinner party where they serve repulsive dishes), and after that they do not appear again. Sometime soon they are going to start shooting an ""Indiana Jones 4"". Harrison Ford has agreed to do the film and hopefully Spielberg will direct once again. The only thing I could hope for more is for Kate to come back as Willie, but what are the chances of Indy being with the same girl in two different movies?

But Temple of Doom was just a lot more fun for me!The bad guys - Mola Ram, Gangster Lao Che, the Thugee cult, etc - were truly evil in the traditional comic book style, the action was ripped right out of the pages of some 30's pulp fiction and the acting was right on target - lighthearted but dedicated and sincere.I saw this movie when I was about 10 or 11, which probably is why I love it so much. I have great memories of sitting in the theater peeking through my fingers at the images of Mola Ram killing his next victim, or of the amazing mine car chase sequence, or the breath taking plunge on a raft from a crashing airplane. And I dont care what anyone says - Lao Che and the whole restaurant scene at the start of the movie is incredible fun. Spielberg demonstrate here that he has this innate ability of packaging what 14 year old boys like in a movie, and making it so it appeals to a whole population.

But I saw this in the theater when I was a kid and I responded to it a lot more strongly than I did to ""Raiders"".  Looking back on it, I realize it's much more of a children's film.  The cartoony woman.  The wise-cracking child sidekick of Short-Round (my childhood idol).The opening musical number?  Followed by Indy in a tuxedo?  And the big chase for the antidote/diamond?  You don't get much better than that, anywhere.  Nobody's coming up with that much imagination anymore.And Indy's really FIGHTING for something here.  The sight of all those children running free at the end?  It's exultant.It's disheartening to hear Spielberg/Lucas downplay this one.  I think it's a really special one.

To engage your audience with this kind of comic-book style, you have to grab them from the outset, and keep hold. Spielberg blows it from frame one with his rather feeble Busby Berkeley pastiche, which sets up a totally wrong set of expectations. This wouldn't matter if what followed had been more efficiently done. Instead, I am forced to notice continuity errors (where did they get their clothes?), longueurs where there should be acceleration, racing action where I could have done with a bit of a slow-down just to catch up ... Having said all that, the movie gripped me to the end. Amongst all the late 20th century directors, Spielberg is the best at doing this.

Having watched it on Netflix recently, I've came to the conclusion that, unfortunately, it does not still hold up for me. Yes it is still an incredible movie full of intense fight sequences (and endearing in today's standards of big blockbuster brawls), great characters, and fun world-building. However, the tone of the story is very jagged and wonky. I feel as though that it struggles on if it wants to be a kid's movie, or be appealed to a more mature demographic. However, that flaw does not detract the film severely, and I will ultimately give this classic a B- rating.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

When I went back to watch it again as an adult, I found it unwatchable for that same reason: Kate Capshaw. I can only wonder if the budding love affair between her and Spielberg might have been the only reason she appears in this film, let alone practically in every scene. She delivers her lines with all of the flair and timing of an over-zealous junior college drop-out. An otherwise decent movie is ruined with every attempt by Mrs. Spielberg to be funny. But I guess landing Mr. Spielberg as a husband made ruining this film a worthwhile experience for Kate Capshaw.

497,DaveInTheCave,Better than it's reputation,9,25 April 2012,"Before 2008 rolled around, Temple of Doom was considered the weakest of the Indiana Jones movies. Though I personally prefer it to Last Crusade (Raiders is far and ahead the best), I'll admit it's inferior from a critical standpoint. For one thing its McGuffin the Sankara Stones, are not as fully realized as the Holy Grail or the Lost Ark. The Ark consumed a platoon of Nazis in fiery wrath. The Grail healed Indy's father and can give eternal life to anyone who drinks from it. The stones start on fire when Jones recites an incantation. When, at the end of the film, Indy says he now understands the power of the stones we do not share in that understanding. Another problem in the film is Willie Scott, Jones' love interest, whose incessant screaming gets annoying after a while. There's also some badly written dialogue. In many scenes people talk over each other, I realize this happens in real life but on film, frankly, it's distracting. Despite all this the film is well made overall. The action scenes are quite exciting, though sloppier than in Raiders. The characters all develop and change through the course of the movie. Indy goes from being glory seeking treasure hunter to becoming a wiser, better man at the end of the film, where he gives the last remaining stone to the villagers. Short Round, Indy's sidekick in this film, actually saves him on multiple occasions, making him more than just another person to get Indy into trouble. Willie changes from a spoiled, rich singer, to smarter more caring person. She also grows closer to Indy and Short Round over the course of the film. Finally, the villain, Mola Ram is appropriately over the top, albeit rather two dimensional. John Williams score is, as always, outstanding.Temple of Doom is a fun throwback to old pulp adventure films from the 30's. Overall, despite being the weakest of the first three Indiana Jones movies, Temple of Doom is a solid adventure film.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Heck, we even have three copies of Last Crusade.""Temple of Doom"" was good, but not as great as Raiders and Last Crusade. Mostly because of the violence in it. Especially the treatment of the slaves and Mola Ram taking out hearts and things made me flinch badly. Also, seeing the children as slaves almost made me lower my rating of the movie.But I still love the small homage to Raiders and Star wars near the end of the movie.

499,hello-41679,Hard to take seriously but still entertaining,7,16 May 2017,"A lot of people criticize this movie, calling it racist. Personally, I find it difficult to be offended because it's hard to take this movie seriously. It's like the writers watched a cartoon and decided to make a live action version. For example, the skulls carved out of stone found in the temple. Really? Reminds me of He-man, Master of the Universe. Then there's the scene where the villain rips out his victim's heart. Very Mortal-Kombat like. So why get offended by a movie that is so obviously over the top? No one seriously thinks Indians eat monkey brains. And I didn't find the child slavery to be a big deal. Villains are supposed to be evil, that's why they're villains. But perhaps people were more conservative in the 80s.The characters are borderline annoying but still fun. Yes, the female lead is ridiculous, but she manages to come around in the end. I found the Asian kid to be endearing. What makes this film great are the action scenes. The mine cart and rope bridge scenes are epic, some of the best in the series, certainly better than anything in Last Crusade.The sets are done fairly well but some of them have an overly ""fake"" quality to them, especially the temple platform and pit, which reminded me of a show at a theme park. I kept expecting the camera to veer to the left or right and accidentally expose a ""Universal Studios"" logo.Despite its flaws, the action scenes alone make this worth watching.

Short Round and Willy have their moments, but they mostly just act like annoying sidekicks. Also, the gross-out parts of the movie feel really hamfisted.It's doesn't strike a perfect balance of faster and slower moments like Raiders did, but if you're looking for constant action; Indy's 2nd flick is a decent choice.Final Score: 63/100 (Copper Medal)",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

His head is about a foot away from the crusher, then after the knife is pulled from the voodoo doll, he is suddenly about 20 feet away.  He wasn't saved by Short Round, he was saved by the editor.  It's like a Monty Python movie. Another example: the fight with those two thugs on the mountain.  It appears Indy has whipped that sword right over the side, but then, lo and behold, he has the sword in his hand. And don't get me started on that ridiculous bridge scene.  This movie scared me when I was a kid, but as I've aged I've found it one of Spielberg's sloppiest films.  And its poorly written.

As a person who highly enjoys dark movies, art, books, etc., I can say that in my opinion this was the least disturbing of the three movies (not that any of them are overly dark).The humor and sequences such as the famous ""dinner scene"" are so ludicrous that they take away from any sense of real foreboding. The plot is also laughable and the poor writing and terrible acting (Willie and Short Round) rip you out of any brief moment of suspended belief. Not to mention, it's hard to be disturbed or scared when you're too busy being annoyed (once again, Willie and Short Round), and you have to be really annoyed to overlook torture and child slavery.Overall, pretty stupid, not very dark.

Since these enemies are so evil the movie seems more fun as Indian Jones keeps fighting and defeating these foes.This film although meant as a ""fun"" adventure movie contains scenes which are gross, disturbing or vile like the monkey brain eating scene, child slavery scenes, the religious torture scene (heart ripped out) to name a few.

509,wizzballs,Asks a for a bit too much suspension of disbelief,6,28 July 2007,"An improvement on Raiders? Don't make me laugh. The over the top feel, the corny dialogue, the kiddy focus, the lack of dramatic context for the action and the weak and superficial attempt at mythology are all forgivable in a movie such as this.What is harder to take is the appalling disrespect shown to Indian culture. As one reviewer here has noted, all Indians in this film are either demonic (i.e. soulless) bad guys or waiting for a westerner to save them. The only other use Spielberg finds Indian culture serves is to disgust us with entirely fabricated depictions of people eating monkey brains and beetles.Kate Capshaw's character also deserves singling out, it seems that the only purpose women serve in this film is to be mothers to children (the women in the village), to complain when they break a nail, but mostly, to scream very loudly, and engage in sexual banter with the lead.But hey, all of these are peripheral issues for what is an action movie.What really bites is just how slipshod some of the direction, but especially the editing of some key action scenes were. The fight to save KC from being dropped into the lava makes absolutely no sense. If we look at it, Short-round in one cut must dispose of about 6 massive bad-guys AND wedge the pulley to account for what we are shown next. But we see NONE of this. We have to imagine it for ourselves, which is asking a lot, if you are over 10.This kind of slipshod editing/direction occurs several times during the movie, and is really the reason why people say this movie is inferior to Raiders, and Last Crusade. It has nothing to do with any 'darker' feel to this picture compared to Raiders, which is something I personally just don't recognise. It's the quality of the action, editing and continuity that made Raiders in particular such a special action film. We can suspend our disbelief in many ways, but, if the action doesn't hold together cinematically (let alone create an illusion of material realism), the film fails.Also to many modern eyes, some of the special (even basic ones) effects will appear remarkably crude, even accounting for the fact the film was made 25 odd years ago.Luckily the film provides us at least one magic moment that reminds us what good action movies are all about. The chase on the mine cart is a simple idea that is brilliantly edited, humorous and exciting, and satisfying in almost every way an action sequence can be.There are many other good moments in this film too, but this is the only one that isn't in some way spoilt by any of the reservations people have about this movie.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
510,gediminas-6,No.1 in the series,10,2 July 2020,"This was the first of the IJ films that I saw as a teenager, and it remains the most impressive to me.
The other two (somehow the Crystal Skull is too far from the rest to be included in the series) are excellent as well, but they are mostly comedies and less of adventure films. True, they've got their part of adventure, but all the threats are taken care of so quickly, and the tone is so light-hearted, that you're only waiting for the next funny moment, without any real concern for the characters.
ToD, on the other hand, takes you on a real, exotic adventure, where you don't know what will happen next.

As an Indian, I would like to point out some of the misconceptions about the county presented in the movie. First, the filmmakers seem to promote the concept that all Indians are small, dark skinned, poverty ridden people surrounded by superstitions and ignorance. In comes Indiana Jones, the globe trotting archaeologist, and the people believe him to be a saviour. Of course, only a white man can protect them against evil forces, and bring back their lost 'fortune and glory' represented by a 'sankara' stone. Second, it is preposterous to suggest that Indians feast on peculiarities like fried eyeballs, baby snakes and chilled monkey brain for dessert. We have culinary tastes as developed and distinctive as any other country, and the choice of food shown in the film shows Indians to be uncivilised and barbaric. third, the association of Goddess Kali with an evil cult practicing human sacrifices also shows the poor knowledge of filmmakers, who clearly did not know that she represents power.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

It wasn't however. While I found the film just as entertaining as the other two Indiana Jones thrillers, I was just as disturbed and disgusted by the sacrifice sequences as I was at the age of 9. Once again, I was thrilled by the score, but I think the best piece, and my favorite will always be Short Round.

519,kaseshin,This is why I think this is the worst Indiana Jones film,4,11 June 2013,"To be honest, this isn't really a review, but a short statement of why I hate this movie, EVEN IF it is far from the worst movie ever. The big issue with this movie is how it handles it's tone. It's fine to change between tones to a certain extent in order to bring up its point, whether it be fear or laughs. The problem with this movie is that it ditches the previous tone altogether only to bring it back in the end.When you start off your movie as a family adventure, then end up showing child slavery, graphic violence and an overall mean-spirited tone, you can't expect the viewers to laugh again once it reaches the end. Sure the first Indiana Jones had its share of gruesome violence, but it still kept the adventurous tone from start to finish.There may be other problems, such as annoying characters and offensive stereotyping of Hindu cults. But considering the well-paced action and haunting music, these could be easily forgiven as cheesy fun.The real reason why I hate this movie is that entire issue with the tone. If you want to be mean-spirited, keep it that way. If you want to be family-friendly, keep it that way. But don't expect that you can keep both of them and make an enjoyable experience.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

524,ERASURE-1,Best Film Ever,10,18 December 1998,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is one of the best movies ever. I think Harrison Ford is REALLY GREAT and it is a very good overall movie. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE. From 1 to 10 I give it 10,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
525,chengaz2000,Great Movie But?,9,30 July 2016,"Great Movie on so many levels, great action and story, pure fun all the way. BUT did anyone else notice that this movie lifted a lot of the ideas for the film, from another movie that came out a year earlier called James Bonds Octopussy?Putting that aside, we don't get great movies like this anymore. I remember seeing this in 1984 on the big screen. A lot of movies lose there appeal as you grow up, but now as a adult I can honestly say this movie is just as appealing now as it was then. Great piece of film making and has something that is missing from today's movies that being Harrison Ford.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
526,kaijones-68929,Sometimes stupid sometimes downright insulting,3,11 November 2019,"Representation of India is laughable and offensive at the same time.
But I don't really care as movies have depicted many places and cultures absurdly.I can see why someone can get offended but
Blood sacrifices were very common in almost every culture, so yeah not offended.Steven must have heard stories and folklores and wrote one script as he saw fit.
So yeah just a movie but a little care on some subtle things would not have cause harm.The dinner scene can leave a person giggling bewildered, insulted and grossed out.
To me it was hilarious.The Chinese kid is way smarter than other enslaved Indian kids as he decided to break the chains by the weapons he was provided while the hundred of Indian kids just accepted their fate.Character of Willie was simply a throw on the word Diva and she did justice by that word.Overall stupid movie.
But I'm like whatever its Indiana Jones so I be watching and liking it.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
527,bgormley-04413,Flawed but excellent.,9,3 May 2020,"I'll be the first to admit this film has issues, but some of the criticisms it receives are just ridiculous.Some of the scenes are a little culturally insensitive: mainly the ones which paint Kali as a kind of Hindu devil. This was obviously done for the benefit of a western audience who (especially in 1984) knew virtually nothing about Hinduism, and would therefore find the plot harder to follow if they couldn't relate it to the Judeo-Christian context of which they were more familiar. There's also the banquet scene, which is just silly (even in 1984: who the hell thought Indian food was like that?).However, many of the people who have reviewed this film should learn the distinction between cultural insensitivity and racism. There isn't a hint of racism to be found anywhere in this movie, and if you think you have found it, then that probably says more about you than about the people who made it.Now for the positives:This film has arguably the best villain of the series. Even though Molar Ram takes a while to show up, he still makes more of an impression than the Nazis from Raiders and Last Crusade in my opinion.Along with both Raiders and Last Crusade, it contributed some of the most iconic scenes and images of the franchise. I'm aware that the giant bugs trigger a phobia in some people, which is understandable. But to be honest, I don't get the complaint that the film is too dark or scary for a general audience. Maybe in 84 these scenes were shocking (wasn't alive yet, so I don't know), but by 2020 standards? Quit acting like this is the first time you've seen depictions of slavery or a gruesome death scene.On the supporting character front: I really liked Shorty, and while Willie is obviously not to everyone's taste as a love interest; I found her amusing enough.Finally- and I realise this is going to piss off a lot of people who say Raiders is the best- it must be pointed out that this is the first Indiana Jones movie where he's the hero of the story, and isn't just along for the ride. He actually saves the world from a supernatural cult in this one. Whereas in Raiders, nothing he did effected the final outcome of the bad guys getting The Ark and being destroyed by it. Hell, Indie didn't even defeat the villains in that movie. It was literally an act of God that did it.All in all, a great action movie and a fine addition to the franchise.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

529,superoatbran,A farewell to Han Solo,10,5 October 2001,"Many fans of the Indiana Jones Trilogy do not care for this installment of the series. Most in fact find the first 15-minutes the only enjoyable ones in the whole film, more or less. Temple of doom is dark, hence the name but the first scene is much more than what the average movie-goer can forseen. The film was released in 1984, the year after Episode VI, Return of the Jedi was too released and Harrison Ford was free of his wonderful vest and blaster and all too eager to dawn his own personal favorite character's fedora and whip. Han Solo was a superb character nonetheless but he is no Indiana Jones, the greatest character in the history of cinema. Han Solo would be number three or so, right after Darth Vader and perhaps in a tie with Vito Corrleone and Rhett Butler. In the opening scene of Temple, Indiana is dealing with the villain Lao Che and as Indy is poisoned by the fiend, a good friend from the past comes to aid him. The aiding character, addressed by Indy as ""HAN""...Han ends up dying in Indy's arms shortly after he is called an ""Old Friend"" but before he does past on, he states: ""Indy, I have been with you on a great many of adventures but the greatest adventure of all, I go first Indy!"" This was George Lucas's and Harrison Ford's clever way of saying farewell to the space pirate from the first most successful film series ever, Indiana being second.Ford was quoted in an interview after the wrap of ""Jedi"" as to saying he was happy to see that vest go, and also in this 1983 interview he was incredibly excited to play his own cosset of roles, the raiding grave robber, Indiana Jones once again.And if the clue wasn't enough for a true Lucasfilm fan to acknowledge, the Shanghai club at which all this opening madness occurred at was named no other than ""THE OBI WAN"" the logo illuminating in pink neon behind some of Lao Che's henchmen exiting the club in pursuit of Short Round and the poisoned Indy with his antidote carrier Willie, not willingly along for the ride. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was made to steer clear of the Nazi storyline not Indy fans, most avid film watchers do not understand this concept and the fine line in which cannot be crossed to make a successful sequel, and that is do not have the same story in every sequel - a bad trilogy or film series is a burned out one, one that bleeds together and not formed like perfect jigsaw pieces as say the ""Back to Future"" trilogy was made to be - one long movie broken up into three acts, each downtime inbetween release dates an intermission if you will. The Indy trilogy is a series of unique and very different adventures in order to thoroughly develop the character and pay homage to the mid 20th century serials, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg grew up idolizing. And true art cannot always be compromising and commercial, a risk was taken and for this Indy fan it fell a little short, one cannot please the perfectionist imaginary but still the picture is quite an epic with incredibly stunning scenes and the reason why the MPAA established a PG-13 rating for future films to come. Fortune and glory kid, fortune and glory...",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
530,rnraoin,Not worth an Indiana Jones movie,3,17 April 2010,"After seeing raiders of the lost ark and the last crusade, I had great hopes from this movie. But was clearly disappointed. Neither the humor nor the excitement matches the other two movies in the series. Also, the pattern seems to repeat and the novelty seems to have disappeared in this movie. Also, the Indian tribe seems a lot over exaggerated and neither funny nor scary. It was only uninteresting and boring to say the least. However, as you would expect in a Spielberg movie, the movie has its moments, though they are few. Amrish Puri is far better in the Shyam Benegal or Govind Nihalani movies. Roshan Seth's role is minuscule. Ford is good as usual. Overall a disappointing movie. I would rather watch an E.T or Raiders of the last ark to enjoy a Spielberg movie.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
531,yodaman,Perfect example of what these movies are about.,9,4 February 2003,"It has been said many times by Lucas and Spielberg, that as kids, they grew-up watching Saturday matinee serials. The whole basis for the ""Star Wars"" saga, and the ""Indiana Jones Trilogy""(soon to be a saga), was to re-create those serials that they as kids, watched and enjoyed. That has not been showed more in a movie by them, than  ""Temple of Doom"". This movie is packed with those ""what will the hero do to get out of this one"" elements. It's actually a prequel to raiders set in 1935. Everything in this movie is spectacular. It's filled with some of the most memorable moments in the series. The eating scene in the temple is still talked about to this day. The climactic scene on the bridge really brings out those matinee serials, and is great to watch. They set out to make these movies, with memories of being wowed when they were younger, and that explains why I think most younger kids, who watch the ""Indy"" series like this one more than the others. I remember being younger, and watching this entry in the series with great enjoyment. It was at the time, my favorite  in the series. ""Raiders"" for a younger child, may be too long, to sit through, and too complex for them to understand. This entry is enveloped with plain, action, and shows Indy as a real all American hero. One that younger kids can really root for. As I got older, and became more involved in movies, and becoming aware of things that don't work, and dialogue etc., I understand why some people may have problems with this entry in the saga. BUT, still, after all these years, ""Temple of Doom"", remains one of my favorite movies of all time. One of my biggest problem with trilogies, is when people do not look at the WHOLE picture. In my opinion, when it comes to trilogies, you need to like them as a whole. Not one by one. To me, it defeats the purpose of a trilogy. The key to a good trilogy, is the first movie. If the first movie is good, then the rest will be. I can understand why people have problems with it. ""Raiders"" was just one of the most brilliant films in cinema history. And that simply explains why ""Indiana Jones"" is one of the greatest trilogies of all time.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
532,wabiish2,"Ouch, this was bad",1,24 April 2020,"Jones was off his game in this movie, in a big way. In the first movie he was dynamic, sexy, and the kind of guy you would want to get to know, if he really exsisted. Not in this movie. They made him the bumbling fool.The weak, insipid, and screaming lead woman was irritating. I was hoping at the dinner she would eat something bad and just go away. Never happened, became worse and I couldn't take it anymore.The first Indiana Jones, I adored and thought this movie would be adventurous, similar to that movie.

534,doyle-va,One of the Greatest Action Movies of All,9,11 June 2005,"There are so many scenes in this movie that are so well executed and conceived that it's almost hard to believe they're all in one movie. Jumping out of the airplane with the raft, the cave of bugs, the wild mine cart ride, and of course one of the greatest movie endings-the fight on the bridge.The new sidekick Short-round in this movie can be annoying, but Indiana is so awesome that short-round's crappiness is made up by Indiana's awesomeness.Some complain about how depressing and violent this film is. Frankly, despite the heart scene, I think it's just as violent as The Lost Ark. It is a little harsher, due to the slavery stuff, but it makes the ending all the greater when the children are set free.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
535,dhesswfb,Disappointing,5,19 April 2015,"Don't get me wrong- I love the Indiana Jones franchise. This movie, however, didn't do it for me. First of all, they leave the excellent idea of Jones battling the Nazis for artifacts, which Steven Spielberg used as a metaphor for the tensions of the Cold War. What did they turn to? A psychotic, satanic cult leader using child slavery to find magic rocks. Add in one of the most annoying and horrible of female companions in film history (Willie), as well as the bland and rather stupid role of a young Chinese boy (Short Round) as Indy's sidekick, and you have the makings for an awful film.Honestly- the antagonist rips people's hearts out but they survive? What's the purpose? Also, the child slavery and torture of Indy and subsequent attempt to brainwash him makes this movie very dark in nature.While this movie had an intention that wasn't terrible, the violence and depressing feel of the movie, as well as terrible acting by the main characters (except for Harrison Ford, who does excellent as usual), makes this film a very bad one. The only reason I didn't rate this film lower is because I am a huge Harrison Ford, George Lucas, and Stephen Spielberg fan, and the music by John Williams was yet again fantastic. Too bad the same can't be said for the plot.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

541,johncordamusic,I love this film as a kid,5,31 October 2019,"It was one of my favorites to watch, along with Empire Strikes Back.I remember thinking Raiders of the Lost Ark was too slow in comparison, and of less interest to me. I was younger when that one came out and I eventually watched it on video with my sister and I just kind of didn't get it.Temple of Doom was more gripping, and had more action, at least in my eyes. The darker tone to the story fascinated me, as well as the gross out dinner scene, but not as much as the mine cart action sequence at the end.I recently rewatched the first two films in the Indiana Jones saga. And wow did I have it backwards.Raiders of the Lost Ark is a stunningly great film, equal to the best of the Star Wars series, Empire Strikes Back, just under some of the greatest films created during those decades, like Bladerunner (Of which all three starred the same actor, man did he have a great agent) and Repo Man (Ok personal preference is weighing in here).But I digress. All of the action scenes in Raiders (of which there are many) are convincing, not too over the top, and just very well created. The dialog, the villains, the acting, the sweeping cinematography that only 70's to very early 80's films produced, are all top notch.I'm sure most film aficionados agree that Raiders is the best of the series, or at least better than Temple of Doom. Most will also agree I'm being too harsh, but the action scenes in this movie, and specifically the special effects, do not hold up after all these years. The curtain gets pulled back too far in HD viewing compared to an average sized TV in the 80s with VHS, and the warts come through too much for me. Look at the mine cart scene I referenced earlier; you will see the puppets version of the three main characters flopping around awkwardly in a little cart from time to time. Other special effects scenes don't stand the test of time either. When the film that started the franchise three years prior did it BETTER and the spectacle, even the stop motion melting faces, holds up better over time, then this movie gets a pass for future viewers. Or, watch it once, and Raiders multiple times.I haven't watched The Last Crusade in quite a while so I have no comment there, but I will be viewing that one soon.I think they tried to do too much with this movie, before CGI was available to make their visions more realistic.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Harrison Ford kicked some major butt as Indiana Jones.  He should have got an Oscar for this movie.  His little side kick was hillarious.  My opinion is that those of us out there that didn't like this movie don't know a good movie when they see one.

543,Shalmai,Frightening to Small Children,6,12 August 2006,"This movie, the second part in the ""Jones"" trilogy, is a great one, nonetheless, but has many scary moments and probably frightening to small children. I first saw this movie when i was eleven years old. It was freaky then, too (definitely a sign). I don't like it as much as the others, so i don't watch it as frequently. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom stars our returning hero, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford, who else). This time he is joined by our screeching heroine, Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw), lucky us, and sweet and friendly Short Round. After narrowly escaping danger, the trio race off and secretly board a plane, which they don't know actually belongs to a Chinese gangster- whom they were running from. The two pilots are told to jump off in India, so Indy, Willie and Short Round find themselves in a ruined village. They come across an elder who pleads for their help, and they journey deep inside a castle, and end up in the Temple of Doom -- hence the name. This particular movie am i truly not found of, yet some may disagree. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, although many people will not approve of it. My comment I feel is not to rude or uncalled for. Many thought that this was a fabulous show when it came out, then came to their senses of how remarkable it is in its crude manner (no offense, Steven). You may read my comment, watch the movie, vice versa, and agree with me or not.

The portrayed relation to 'native tribes', as well as the completely one-dimensional character of Willie are things I can no longer sit through. Worse: people tend to blame Kate Capshaw, instead of the writers and directors who put her in this position in the first place. Women were viewed as sexualized, dumb damsels-in-distress 80s without qualms, but by 2020 the movie has become unwatchable.
It's a shame, in a way, that I (and probably others) can't see past that anymore to see the fantastic visuals and inventive adventures the movie has to offer.
This Indy movie is sometimes blamed for using elements of the 'supernatural'. The supernatural has played a part across all Indy movies, but it is true that this movie leans into it a lot more.

I won't get into the main plot, because when a movie is this bad the plot really dosen't matter. It starts off like any 80s adventure movie, seems perfectly fine the first 40/60min, and the acting has no greater flaws, but when Indiana, Short (little asian boy) and Willie (white, overdramatic, stereotypical woman) go into the ""tempel"", all hell breaks loose. The director and creators of this movie have no chill, at first they show a very incorrect and might I even say racist version of a Kali cult, and Indiana and the crew almost get sacrifised to Kali for a couple of minutes, and when you think that's over, they go in mine carts, and guess what, the Kali cult chase after them under very dramatic and scary circumstances for another couple of minutes. When they're finaly out of the mine and you think it's finaly over, there's a very long and unsafe ropebridge to cross, and ofc, there are crocodiles under the bridge, and then naturaly the bridge breaks, about 40 other traumatic things happend and I think I've erased the ending from my brain.

Most of the action takes place in India, in a remote palace brought mysteriously to live after decades.

Well, nothing could be more than farther from truth.In fact racial profiling is the only makes sense when the story of Mohammed and Jesus are almost the same and yet America believes that Jesus was right and when the study of both Jesus and Prophet are widely debated.

556,VegasBabyVegas1,"In retrospect, not as good a film as once thought",8,19 December 2004,"In the summer of 1984 one Saturday tea-time, when I was 9, my young brothers and I were taken to see the event movie of that year, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.Thrilling, horrifying and funny in equal measure, we came out of that cinema having had the best film experience of our young lives up to that point. That we had managed to see the film despite the furore over the controversial rating and dark material (even Spielberg at the time stated that he would not let his young children watch the film), only added to our thrill. For months afterwards, we would mimic the whip-cracking main character and exciting set-pieces in the playground at school.In retrospect though, and having seen the film for the first time in 8 years and on a pristine DVD transfer, the film is not the classic I had once esteemed it to be. Disjointed and with little plot, it has not worn as well as Raiders or Last Crusade. Temple of Doom, in fact, is little more than a series of set-pieces with no thought to character development. The main bad guy does not show up until the final third of the film, the special effects (mine-car chase and bridge sequence are major gripes) have dated, the editing is twitchy (check out Mola Rams 'trap door escape' from Indy in the temple) and the ending ridiculously trite (""Yes, I understand its power now"").Not that the film doesn't have its merits, the opening Busby Berkely inspired musical dance number at the Shanghai nightclub, along with its subsequent brawl sequence, is a triumph of flair and bravura. The booby-trapped and insect infested room sequence too is a masterclass in both suspense and comedy timing.However, I have still rated this film 8 because of the effect it had on me at the time of its release and throughout the VHS era. It also remains ten times more enjoyable than most summer blockbusters of recent years and ensured that we got to see Last Crusade, which was a welcome return to whip-cracking form.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
557,josh_vanmoorsel2,"It was ""Okey dokey Docta Jones""",7,19 August 2012,"As I am reading other reviews for this film, I notice people continue to complain about the realism of it, (voodoism, ancient rituals)but come on, you are watching an Indiana Jones movie for crying out loud, where ghosts, booby traps, undead, retrieving religious artifacts not to mention a knight that lives for a thousand years, for the most part have been watched without a question being raised. I'm not a very big fan of the Indiana Jones Trilogy, (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is entirely out of the question) but I will insist that this is the best of them, especially for an older audience. I especially like the comic relief they had with the boy from Bangkok (Short Round). Go into this film eager for the Classic, adventure packed Indiana Jones that we know and love, not as flawless, politically correct masterpiece.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
558,lexsilvertouch,Equal to Raiders,9,24 June 2007,"Just a handful of sequels are as good as their originals: The Empire Strikes Back, Spiderman 2, and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.Doom manages not just to have all the fun and suspense of Raiders, and maintain the tone of that film, but also to be worlds apart and establish it's own, unrelated brilliance. In many ways it is a better film, with Harrison Ford settling comfortably into the role, and Spielberg coming to a forte of his action direction skills, though it never quite manages the classic nature of Raiders.But consider these scenes: The Club Obi-Wan brawl, the street chase, the escape by plane/dinghy, dinner at Pankot Palace, the catacombs, the heart-ripping scene, the spike ceiling room, Indy's conversion, the mine cart chase, and the bridge finale... just a few examples of the brilliance of the film.Admittedly it features a dry patch following the terrific opening, and Kate Capshaw's performance as Willie Scott has definitely polarised audiences, but this film is as fun as you'll ever see, and continues the proud tradition of Indiana Jones.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
559,cedchaumont,The worst of the trilogy but still entertaining,8,7 April 2016,There is some really good action in this movie at the beginning and especially at the end that saved the movie for me because there is a lot of problem in this movie. The biggest problem I have with this film is the woman played by Kate Kapshaw she is really annoying especially in the beginning. The silliness of the plot notably the voodoo stuff at the end really did not work for me. Nonetheless this movie is entertaining from beginning to end with some good performances most notably by Harisson Ford amazing set and imagery and funny moments. This movie is a good time and it holds up pretty well however it is still the worst in a very good trilogy but it is still way better than kingdom of the crystal skull.,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
560,chriscquinn,I honestly have no idea what people are bitching about (besides Willie),9,23 May 2015,"I can't believe there are people who think this is the worst Indiana Jones movie, because this to me is neck and neck with Raiders if it weren't for Willie. Yes Willie is really annoying, but why does that make a movie bad? Didn't the director and screenwriter(s) do their job if you hate a character they purposefully made annoying? Why they made her annoying is another story and I'm not completely sure why. Maybe it was because in Raiders Indy needed Marion's help, so in this they changed it so it was Willie who needed Indy. I don't know. But this is one of my favorite movies and had a lot of fun watching it, everything is incredibly well made. Short Round was cute and wasn't an annoying kid who was just there because they wanted to appeal to kids (ok that might be part of it, but honestly who the hell cares), and had great chemistry together. The action scenes are phenomenally directed by the one and only Steven Spielberg. The score is of course excellent, Harrison Ford is good although maybe not as good as he was in Raiders, and screenplay has a great story and dialogue. The script isn't as good as Raiders, but not every writer is Lawrence Kasdan. Now I know I have pointed out a lot of things that aren't as good as Raiders, but just because they are not as good as a masterpiece, does not mean it isn't great. So my only problem with this is Willie, but that does not change my rating of a 10. But that does mean I won't call this a masterpiece like Raiders is, but this is a near masterpiece. I seem to be one of the few who loved this as much as Raiders, buy if you haven't seen any of the Indy movies give them a watch because they're a lot of fun, and make you feel like a kid again (except Crystal Skull).",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Secondly, when Indy and co arrive at the village, which is supposed to be in India/Nepal, the people are speaking Sinhalese, the national language of...Sri Lanka! WTF? A language not even spoken in India! Look at a frickin map Spileberg! Why not frickin' Korean then? Parts of TOD were filmed in Sri Lanka, and Spielberg didn't even bother getting the goddamn languages right? It's like saying, 'yeah, *beep* it. as long as they're brown and they speak some kind of gibberish, no one will care'.

Yadda, yadda, yadda... For starters, let's all remember that it is a movie, not a documentary. It was never made to show us Kali rituals or life in India. It was made for fun. I, for one, enjoyed it. It wasn't as good as Raiders or Last Crusade, of course, but it was also a different style. I liked the mine cart sequence and the rope bridge. Most of the movie was pretty good. The only thing I really have a complaint about is the alligators at the end... To me, it's too obvious that they're just ripping up some cloth.

565,cashvaz,Why was this one dark?,8,14 January 2019,"Spielberg made this movie darker than all the other Indy films due to splitting with his wife at the time.

He sort of put his character in Indy in this film to show his wife that he was hurt, tortured and even turned evil temporarily because of her. But fortunately, he found his new wife during the making of the movie, who turned out to be the actress who portrayed Willie Scott!HOPE THIS BACKGROUND MADE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THIS FILM AND WHAT SPEILBERG WAS GOING THROUGH.

There's the delightful Short Round with his funny antics and John William's theme to boot. Then there's Willie Scott who complains about everything. But of course there's Indiana Jones with his daring wit and courage who would always win the day against the bad guy bringing me to Mola Ram. Mola Ram the sinister high priest who tears out people's hearts. I don't know why but I've always been a sucker for this one. Maybe cause I grew up watching it.

The movie takes totally different locations, from landing over Himalaya to some costal regions with southern Indian language where you see punjabi People who are from totally different region of india and then the palace which is in Rajasthan.
This was a very big puzzling thing, which not only misleads the mind but also makes us think what did the scrip writers think and where is the research.2. The scene where Indian are shown eating all wild animals, like snakes, monkey, eye soup ...was again a misleading scene to the world.
I think people around the world must have imagined Indians to eat all those but to the contrary, the fact is Indians are pure vegetarian people...3. The concept of kali in the movie is too much disturbing, the way everything was shown must be interesting to see but far from reality.4. Lastly, the presence of Britishers in 1984 movie was a big blunder as India was independent at that time and plus, Britishers were so good to the kingdom as shown in the movie, coz the child labour weren't done the Indians as shown in the movie in the mining scene, but Britishers did..and tried to convert people into their faith...Overall though the movie was far from reality and based on false fact, i still gave 7 points coz A movie like this in 1984s must have been a real treat and loved the effects and all...the director managed to fool the people around the globe to show such fiction but could see so much of hardwork...Love the acting of the both lead actor and actress plus that chinese kid....",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
574,unionstagehandj,Blatant Anti-Thugee Bias,4,31 August 2006,"Indiana Jones travels to India to plunder the country of a few of its precious religious artifacts.The story starts off as Jones has just looted a sacred Chinese crypt and is trying to sell the remains of a dead emperor to a violent gangster. Jones plays hardball during the negotiations, seeking to maximize his grave-desecrating profits. At one point, he even threatens to maim a helpless showgirl to strengthen his bargaining position. The gangsters try to calm Jones with some harmless poison, and he responds by rudely trashing the entire nightclub. Jones escapes and, with the help of his Asian boy-slave Short Round, kidnaps the showgirl. The casting is adequate here. Ke Huy Quan and most of the other supporting characters are genuinely funny. Kate Kapshaw (the director's girlfriend) fits perfectly as the vacuous, superficial showgirl hack. She's the only actor in the entire picture who doesn't seem to recognize that she is in a B-movie. And I can't believe George Lucas made the only female character shallow and stupid. I just can't believe it. After a pilot mix-up in their plane, Jones and Showgirl don't even TRY saving the airplane, instead bailing out with Short Round after stealing a raft. Jones, Showgirl, and Short Round are rescued by some poor Indian villagers, who freely give up what little food they have to the strangers. Jones responds by doubting Sheba's divine providence and spitting in the face of their religion. The villagers need Jones' help because they claim a local Thugee cult has kidnapped their children. Jones agrees to help the second he finds out there might be some precious artifacts involved. The trio travel to the palace of the Maharaja, where they promptly insult and embarrass the young ruler so much that he seeks solace in the local Thugee cult, which by an amazing coincidence happens to have their temple hidden below his palace. Jones and company promptly break into the Thugee temple, desecrating the sacred site with glee. But they aren't content to merely steal and plunder. Jones even interrupts their mining operation. He notices the working conditions aren't quite as plush as an American office, so he violently attacks the mine supervisors. Jones and his cohorts are finally detained. The friendly Thugee leader insists on sharing a local drink with Jones as a peace gesture. This time, Jones literally spits in the face of their time-honored religion. Fast forward a few days. Jones has reconciled with the Thugees and joined their little church group. But it seems his American influence is still with him as he is now apparently abusing drugs and constantly in a stupor. Showgirl also seems to have made amends with the Thugees, even apparently agreeing to help them with their quaint lava ritual. Meanwhile, Short Round is unhappy with his new full-time job in the Thugee mines. Instead of discussing his problems with management, he ruins some company equipment (shackles and chains) and wanders off without even clocking out. Adding insult to injury, he then steals a torch, interrupts the holy Thugee ceremony, and tries to torch the cult's newest member, Indiana Jones. Not wanting to get torched again by Short Round, Jones joins him AGAIN in kidnapping Showgirl. Back to the mines, where Jones' cohorts join him in inciting labor unrest, resulting in a violent riot. They escape, but not before stealing some priceless religious stones and a mine cart from the luckless Thugees. The benevolent Thugee priest and his altar boys confront the Jones gang on a local bridge and plead for the return of their precious religious relics. Jones responds by ruining the bridge, feeding the altar boys to some crocodiles, killing the priest, and tossing all but one of the relics. The British army even shows up to slaughter some of the locals and save the white-skinned plunderers. Even after ruining the local magic-rock-digging industry and putting all of the young workers out of jobs, Jones is still greeted as a hero when he returns to the Indian village.

579,s-94126-00422,Entertaining but predictable,5,23 January 2020,"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a film that needs no introduction. It has all the action, humor, and mystery that have made the others in the series so popular, but this one had some issues, as did some of the others, but it didn't hinder their popularity.Same as the other movies in the series, this movie follows Indiana Jones, a man with seemingly no sense of danger or fear and an endless amount of energy on an exhilarating, and perilous escapade. The movie opens in an elaborate restaurant with a hectic fight between a drugged Indiana Jones and one of his business partners over a trade; The Peacock's Eye, a massive diamond, for the ashes of Nurhachi, the first emperor of the Manchu Dynasty in China. After a thrilling escape, Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford, Wllie Scott, played by the beautiful Kate Capshaw, and Scout Round, played by a young Jonathan Ke Quan, disembark on a journey filled with suspense and action in their search for the Sankara stones. But the movie faced challenges, one aspect was how predictable the acting made the plot. Based on the actors' reactions and body language, you could get a sense of what is going to happen before it actually happened. This made the movie somewhat boring to watch since nothing was super surprising. Another piece which made the movie a little difficult to watch was the rapid change of camera angle during important scenes. The camera focused on a lot of things and people, making everything seem important, when there were only a few important objects in the scene. This took away from the gravity of some of the important objects in the movie. But this didn't take away from the plot, which was intriguing and captivating, it just wasn't surprising when something happened. Another challenge for the movie was how unrealistic some stunts were. The escape from the plane was exhilarating yet very implausible. The chances of surviving the fall off a cliff into the river doesn't seem possible, but it added to the outlandish style of the movie and it fits perfectly. A large part of Indiana Jones films are the fights, and while they were very entertaining, they were, similar to other events in the movie, far-fetched and ridiculous. But the fights and other stunts in the movie were not out of the ordinary for movies of the time, or even movies in the present. With the advancements in CGI, it's difficult to watch movies from this time without noticing the cheesy special effects. The scenes where the movie used it, the plane crash for example, was clearly faked using special effects. Compared to movies that have been released recently, the effects are very noticeable, but when compared to movies released in and around 1984, the special effects were right on par with the others. Overall the movie had an intriguing plot and was a good movie when it was released by Lucas Films. But the predictable acting, the absurd fights and stunts, confusing filming and camera angles, and unrealistic acts made the film slightly underwhelming and ridiculous.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

For one, most of you don't know what you are talking about, and second, most of you are biased.After talking to many of my friends, I found out that many didn't like the Temple of Doom simply because it didn't stick along the same lines as the other two (Judeo-Christian beliefs).  God forbid that people should be exposed to other cultures and religion.  After hearing this response from my friends, I became infuriated and realized that's why most people probably didn't like this film.  It infringed on their own beliefs and ideals.  You people need to wake up and see films open-mindedly.Ranting aside, I liked this film and it rates better than most movies today and in the past.  It is action packed and has beautiful scenery and props. It also has a magnificent score by the maestro himself, John Williams, but would you expect any less?  It is definitely darker than the other 2 in the trilogy, and may be frightening to children under 10.For those who are not open-minded and will only watch Indy films that follow the ""Judeo-Christian"" belief system, this film is not for you.

Add to that the misrepresentation of the food habits of India just to get a few laughs.India is a country which is more than 50% vegetarian and the non vegetarians eat meat of chicken, fish, mutton or in an extreme beef. To misrepresent and portray the people of India as insect and reptile eaters is vile and shows the mentality of the 'esteemed' director.I am disgustingly surprised that the Indian actors who were casted in the movie did not deign to correct the vile director. Spineless cowards and beggars.For the record, Maa Kali is THE mother goddess who the Hindus worship. She is the epitome of power and life. SHE is called 'Shakti meaning power.

583,ptrckdaly,A Pulp Classic,9,18 November 2006,"The most repeated mistake that critics make when discussing this film is judging it by modern day standards. Under those criteria, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is extremely sexist with Capshaw as the helpless and annoying damsel in distress. It is racist with the negatively, stereotypical portrayal of Jonathan Ke Quan as the pickpocket Chinese orphan. While we are at it, this movie makes countless errors in continuity and logic throughout the entire 118 minutes.Instead of judging Temple of Doom by modern day standards, we should appreciate the film for what it is: A true, heartfelt throwback to the classic titles of Pulp magazines. In the same vain as Doc Savage, Indiana Jones is a ""Man of Bronze,"" who travels the world in search of adventure and danger. He does not feel pain for longer than 30 seconds; can punch a guy unconscious with one blow; and though outwardly conceited, maintains saintly compassion for those around him. In other words, he is totally unreal. But that is, in my opinion, the allure of the character.It is obvious, if you know the history and mythology of the Pulp stories that Temple of Doom was made as a means to pay homage to the great writers like Walter B. Gibson, Edwin Burkhilder and Lester Dent. In addition to these people, the second Indy flick makes many comical references to other Lucas and Spielberg films. For example, the name of the bar at the beginning of the film is called Club Obi Wan. All of these gags set the movie up as a treat to all the members in the audience who shared in on the mysterious of Pulp magazine stories that Lucas did as a kid.Bearing all this in mind, I loved Temple of Doom and believe it is one of the best attempts in recent years to recapture that adventurous spirit that was created back in the early 20th century.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

586,indiana_jones_forever,"""INDY-SCRIBABLE!""",10,31 March 2002,"With respect to each and every honest opinion about this disrespectfully dumped-on, yet highly successful blockbuster, it seems that many people out there still judge a motion picture for its kind and not for how it serves that kind. They say this second INDIANA JONES (which was my first, by the way) was  dark, gross, violent, or whatever. Well, people, since I dont see anybody judging this adventure artistically, let's not forget that movies are art. They can take more forms than we know, and all they require is our appreciation. Yeah ok, so there are things you cant help but feel uncomfortable with or see as plain stupid, but I'm sure you can surpass that by taking them from a different point of view at least to feel the joy it brings to others, right? After all, a movie can only make sense if it entertains or interests you, but unfortunately, the simple truth is that many moviegoers are too proud of themselves as discriminating little suckers who think they've seen it all. Suit yourself.I only ramble about this subject because of what I've learned from this very particular movie : beauty is where it's perceived, whether you're young or old; it's just a matter of how much you appreciate it. I saw INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM when I was somewhere between 7 and 8 years old, and even though I can now understand very clearly why it would seem weaker than RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK  to most people, I could never call it either better or worse, because of the most passionate memory I have of it.As a wild n' wonder-filled little boy, I fell madly in love with the very first glimpse I caught of it in a preview on TV when two really cool-looking Indian swashbucklers came face to face with this new, fairly muscular hero with a cowboy hat, bullwhip hanging to his belt, dirty white shirt with a fully torn right sleeve, and a scarred unshaved face that greeted them with a one-of-a-kind killer smile. Beautiful! Just beautiful! And with the wild jungles in the morning background, it hit even harder!When I went to see it at a theater with my family, even with my highest expectations, I could never describe how overpowered I became by every single ingredient of this roller-coaster ride from hell. Here's a few: awesome hero, awesome villains, colorful visual dynamics, creepy nightmarish feel, high-spirited sense of humor,`heart-ripping' violence, stunt-filled action, brutal voodoo magic, John Williams' sensational score, not to mention the delicious adventurous flavor of India ( which was a huge part of the magic ) and, of course, those totally disgusting gags that made me laugh like crazy. ( Hey, when you're a 7.5 year-old male watching a fat guy let out a monster belch after sucking the insides of a king-size bug, it'll pretty much make your day too. Heh, heh)I must admit that I've never been totally swept away by my moments with a movie as much as I'd been with this one, and I hope to relive them someday by trying harder to understand and appreciate the art of movies instead of simply making comments like film critic Leonard Maltin who called my NO#1 favorite movie `headache-inducing'.Well look who's talking.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
587,admiralhowdy,"a second look, 25 years later",8,18 July 2009,"I'll be brief. When I saw Temple of Doom in the theater in 1984, there were a few things in it that just plain ruined it for me, and made it a big letdown as the much-anticipated follow-up to the greatness the was Raiders. Certain things in the movie were just too *unbeleiveably* hokey, unabashedly ludicrous. Sure, I know, it was a movie, more Saturday matinée escape-ism from Spielberg and Lucas, recapturing their boyhood wonder at the old adventure serials. But some things in this movie simply took my willing suspension of disbelief, kicked it in the tenders, defecated on it, and then laughed at me. I'm not talking about small petty things like the numerous ways they found to make Kate Capshaw shriek and whine every 5 minutes. I'm talking about the deal-breakers, like the cushy ski-landing of the air-raft on a snowy slope, after plummeting through countless seconds of sky (and shrieking). I'm talking about the bafflement of somebody inexplicably surviving the sight of their own beating heart being ripped from their own chest, only to be plunged (still conscious and screaming) into a pit of lava several long (heartless) seconds later. I'm talking about physics-defying mine-cart jumps between broken rails at breakneck speeds, carts landing again and again with perfect precision on target rails that could only be hit with the aid of divine intervention. That crap... would never happen. Because it *couldn't* happen. So what if it was just a movie. You pushed my wiling suspension of disbelief too far. You... abused it. And this sequel/prequel was nothing more than an exploitative cash-in. I could almost see them saying ""Oh boy, the audiences will just *love* this part!"" Phleh...Well, somehow during that first viewing, I missed the significance of that village elder saying that Shiva had sent Indy to bring back the stolen children. And that was a key point. A *plot* point, that brings it all together. Watching 25 years later, I get it. Yeah, the guy without the heart, that was just a black magic illusion, representative of the forces of evil. But the falling raft salvation? The mine-cart landings, well... those things actually *were* divine intervention. Indy is the good guy, and unseen supernatural forces of good were helping him the whole way. Just... think about it. Let's just say that I appreciate this movie a lot more now than I did then. It's a lot better than I had thought.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
588,praskon,Indiana Jones and the Movie of Stupidity,2,11 May 2008,"what a joke of a movie!!! It is a big letdown especially after watching the 1st Indy movie. some of the sequences in the movie are absolutely laughable and unbelievably stupid. The biggest joke is the dinner sequence in the palace. and what was surprising is that this is a movie directed by Steven Spielberg. the scene shows a dinner menu at an Indian king's palace having some weird things like slimmy eel like creatures, Crispy bugs for starters, a soup which had eyes in it and finally Monkey brains for dessert... yuck!! C'mon how stupid can this movie get... even the end was a joke.. watch it at your own peril.. for me it was a waste of 2 hours.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
589,jedi-pirate-4815,Quite Impressed,8,29 July 2008,"Strangely enough, I found this movie to be even better than 'Raiders', which had some dragging moments where my attention slipped a bit. This movie, from start to finish, was filled with action-packed scenes, but not so much that it felt too busy. I don't need to go on forever, so I'm just going to hit some key points: 1. Willie Scott must go.Seriously. From the moment she was introduced to the moment the credits rolled, I couldn't stand her. I was practically screaming with indignation when Indy wound up with her. She had no respect for other cultures, had no guts at all, let out a high-pitched scream every thirty seconds, and the only useful thing she did was pull a lever or something. I spent the entire movie waiting for her to do something helpful so that perhaps I could maybe half-like her, but that moment never came. She spent the entire climax fight locked up in a cage or screaming bloody murder in a mine cart. She made me want to puke in Shorty's hat. Ugh. Marion was so much better.2. On the other hand, Short Round was an enrapturing character whom I fell in love with in the first ten minutes of his appearance. The scene where he and Jones were bickering over a poker game in Chinese was amusing, and his accented English was pretty cute. And, unlike Willie Scott, he helped out quite a bit in various circumstances. His relationship with Indy was rather touching, and when he was begging Indy to snap out of his trance or whatever with his 'you're my best friend, I love you' speech, it was kind of like an 'ohhhhh!' moment. I wish he'd come back for another movie.3. Despite my intense dislike for Willie, the 'nocturnal activities' scene was rather amusing, as well as the 'five minutes' thing afterward. :-) 4. In 'Raiders', the only supernatural thing we saw was when the Ark was opened. This movie was chock-full of it, with glowing magic rocks and some guy getting his heart ripped out and still being alive, voodoo dolls, etc. It gave the movie a different flavor. I'm not sure if I liked it or not, but it was definitely not the type of fantasy you see nowadays.5. It's kind of unsettling that none of the movies have no real connection to each other (no returning characters but Indy, no references to past events, etc.) I think we need some connecting link to tie all the movies together or something. I mean, if Indy said something about Willie in 'Raiders', that might give the two movies more of a connection, like they're all part of the same series, which they are. All the movies just seem kind of disconnected. But maybe that's just me.6. What exactly was the point of the brawl in the nightclub, aside from picking up Willie? I have yet to figure out why that took twenty minutes of movie time...That's about it. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was because of Willie. Excellent movie.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
590,WhitePhantom,One of the greatest adventure films of all time...,8,8 April 2003,"Everyone complains about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. One of my friends and I used to argue for months on end about which Indian Jones film was the superior. Almost anyone we ask say that Temple of Doom is their least favorite, and the worst in the Jones trilogy. I believe the only reason people say this, is because it's the middle film, sandwiched between an all time classic, and a Hollywood blockbuster. To me, there is NO question that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the far superior Indiana Jones film. To anyone who says Last Crusade is the best I can do nothing but disagree (let me point out that all THREE films are nothing short of phenomenal). Temple of Doom had so much to live up to after the first film, and instead of trying to re-create Raiders (something I feel Crusade did), Lucas and Spielberg decided to take the franchise in a new direction. In my opinion, this was a great idea. Crusade and Raiders are too similar: both of them take place in desert terrain, both have Indy going after a very famous, biblical artifact, and both have Indy fighting off the Nazi's from attaining this object for global domination. Without Temple of Doom, Last Crusade would be an obvious copy of Raiders of the Lost Ark. A different style of Indy film is needed to expand the trilogy, making Indiana Jones a truly global character, and Temple of Doom did just that.The film itself is a non-stop action, adventure ride. Harrison Ford is once again AMAZING as the dashing professor/archaeologist thrill seeker. Short Round is a loveable character who adds a humorous touch, and reveals the more compassionate side of Indy's character. The ceremony scenes are truly breathtaking and tense. During these scenes the film contains some very graphic images, but are used justifiably to convey the real dark, feel of this film (i.e. the removing of the man's heart while he's still alive, and lowering him into a fiery pit). The mine cart chase scenes are the most amazing, fast moving action sequence in any of the Indy films, and you feel like you're on a roller coaster each time you watch it. All these events lead to the film's spectacular and memorable climax.I know with three films as amazing as the Indiana Jones trilogy, it's hard to pick a best and worst film, in fact it's nearly impossible. I'm just going to say that each film is great on it's own, and really shouldn't be compared to the other two.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
591,kapilmania,Wonderful depiction of India...,1,28 August 2014,"Well an Oscar Award and rating of around 8/10 on IMDb. This has to be a masterpiece. It was a masterpiece indeed. Every society has its own stereotypes but America is leader of them all. And sadly people do believe in what movies show.I mean come on: Indians, irrespective of whatever time the director has referred to, in this movie, never eat snakes, beetle, crabs, eye-ball soup and frozen monkey brains. I do not know about other societies but in India, a large percentage of population is vegetarian. Oops! I guess in next movie Spielberg will show them eating mud and leaves.And I do not understand the reason why people try to ridicule some religion even when they don't know what it stands for. This was one of the most racist, ill-informed, pathetic piece of crap I've ever come across.

593,Sergio_Barba,Indiana Jones And Legend was...,10,26 January 2014,"I think the best film in the series is Raiders is a movie perfect adventure has a great script , great soundtrack , the performances are high level ( for all involved ) and direction is superb.For me , it had to be an Oscar for best film at the time.Now, I have to clarify something else, like I said , the best movie Raiders of the saga , because it is perfect ( the opening of the Golden Idol truck or persecution are Jewels for the history of cinema) , but I have to say that Indiana Jones movie I've seen more times - By far - and entertains and amuses me all , it is certainly "" The Temple of Doom .""Why? Because it has a mixture of action, adventure , and humor excellent in its proper place, is a movie where Indiana is not a archaeologist who seeks to unearth ""pigs "" or search idols , is the story of how a man , a cursed sect defies the confines India. How helping others without personal gain , not looking "" Fortune and Glory "" sought to destroy the Thuggie sect, get sacred stone to restore peace to the Indian village and save all enslaved children of hell itself on Earth. Indiana Jones confronts them , and again beating the odds, achieving your goal so heroic .Persecution in the mine , the end of the suspension bridge , fighting with Thuggie in giant rock crushing tape ... everything is superb , leaves you breathless , you want more and more, while listening to ""Slave Children Crusade "" , seeing a Dr Jones with torn shirt, an enviable physical , machete and whip in hand ...I think many of the stories in comics "" heroic "" Indy that created were inspired by this movie , as Indiana passes being a legendary archaeologist to be a superhero with many weaknesses , human but very cunning and bravery.Finally, an entire roller-coaster of emotions and action scenes today day are already legendary , culminating tape first Entertainment level .So I said , for me, the adventure movie ( and Indy) more I have seen all by far the most fun and me and entertains .",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

Capshaw is good but her character is mindless. I'm a real Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford fan but Willie is simply not believable as a character. She spends the first 2/3's of the movie whining and then undergoes a magical transformation. Really hard to take. Why couldn't she be a little stronger to begin with. She is a ""scamming gold digger"", after all. Maybe not Laura Croft but, at least SOME ovaries! The is good solid fun once Willie gets over herself and becomes a believable character.

And those who eat meat ,mostly eat lamb ,fish and chicken. India is very peaceful country and believes in the ideology of 'live and let others live'. The movie is entirely against the Indian culture and it's belief. This movies gives viewers wrong impression about India and it's people. I am sorry if this comment of mine hurts anyone here.

Yes, I know it's fiction, but it was grossly inaccurate and extremely insensitive. I had to spend a great deal of the movie explaining to my 8 year old that people in India are not like that. I am not from India, yet I found myself offended and ashamed that American movie makers would create such horrible stuff.The lead female character was a screaming ninny. They made her the butt of a great deal of juvenile humor and so annoying it was hard to understand how Indie found her attractive....well at least in any way not purely physical.This movie went from bad to worse.

This Indiana Jones movie was still pretty good, but the others are much better. For one thing, this is a major motion picture with Steven Spielberg as the director, but it has some of the worst special effects I have ever seen. The scene when the airplane crashes into the mountain and they slide down the snow on the raft, the airplane crash is so fake and it's obviously a movie screen behind them when they are going down the mountain. It seems like its really low budget, but its a sequel to a major motion picture and Spielberg so it can't be. The plot is OK but not as good as the other films. Still, this film is definitely worth checking out if you like the other Joneses, it has some cool characters and great actions scenes, like the very beginning in the club and the mine cart.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

(My brother's observation, not mine, but an accurate one!) It's absurd where Raiders was exciting and disgusting where Raiders was enjoyable in creepiness and thrills. By far the biggest anchor in the film is Kate Capshaw's character. I defy anyone to find a single sentence she spouts that isn't irritating and / or useless. Indy is a caricature of who he was in Raiders, the gags are lame and then the movie veers wildly into the gross or way too dark and violent. I'm amazed the makers of this one were connected to the first film. Truly, this one's a disappointment not worth wasting hours of your life on.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

I had to watch the film due to a bet with my boyfriend ""for every Pokémon movie, one Indiana Jones movie"". So I guess you've understood what kind of films I prefer. Anyway, while watching ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" I was shocked to see some actors from Sri Lanka and even more freaked out to hear them speak Sinhalese. After a few seconds I had to pause the film because I had a question. Didn't Indi and the others fall above the Himalayan mountains?? Isn't it suppose to be in India?? Well the film review says that the village is located in India and also during the film they talk about India but then how come the village people speak in Sinhalese??OK, so I'm sure that Mr. Steven Spielberg wanted to keep a low budgets so he got some actors from Sri Lanka (ex Ceylon) but did he really have to let them speak in Sinhalese?? Couldn't he dub it in Indian?? Sinhalese is a language spoken by Sinhalese people and Sinhalese people live in Sri Lankan and being a Sri Lankan I'm pretty sure that there is no village in India that speaks Sinhalese instead of their mother language.Well I guess they didn't do their home work before they started making the film.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
600,aaronnubins,Why i think people should watch this film,8,15 December 2005,"Indiana Jones I would definitely suggest that other people watch this film in fact I think that all other people should watch it. The story is great because it's filled with lots of sweet action. This movie also gives Harrison Ford, who is a great actor, a great character. But you might want to watch the other Indiana Jones movies first.I remember watching this movie when I was just a little kid and loving it I didn't really remember any of the story line or anything I just remember watching it and then last summer while I was fishing on my dads fishing boat we went to blockbusters and bought a bunch of used movies. One of the films that I chose was Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. I must have watched that movie over a dozen times last summer on the boat. And now I see why I liked it so much.The story in this movie is awesome Indiana Jones goes into an evil palace and has to steal back a sacred stone from a human sacrificing cult and free the children of the surrounding villages who have been kidnapped for manual labor. Its great it has all kinds of really cool parts in it. There are so many instances of good action in this movie it is hard to pick a few that give a good representation of just how great it is. One of my favorite parts of the movie was when Jones Shorty and Willy jump out of a crashing plane and use an inflatable life raft to cushion there fall and then sled down a mountain in it. Another part that I really liked was when the evil priest puts his hand in the slaves chest and rips his heart out that is awesome. The fight that he has with the huge slave driver down in the mines underneath the palace is great.I think that one reason that I like Harrison Ford so much is he has gotten in some great films like Apocalypse Now and American Graffiti but he has also had some pretty awesome roles to play when you think about it. I mean the guy played Han Solo in the star wars movies and Rick Deckard in Blade Runner. I think that is pretty good for any guy but he also plays Indiana Jones and I cant think of anyone that could do it better. Ford is perfect for it if you think about it Jones and Solo are pretty similar characters and Ford plays the adventurer He is pretty much a normal looking guy physically he might be a little bit more fit than the average guy but he is not some supper ripped Vin Diesel or The Rock type. So its cool you get the feeling that he's a real person but he is still a bad ass because he's smart and tough. Not tough like he can go pick guys up and throw them around but tough like he can take a lot of abuse.The only thing that I would say to someone if they asked me if they should watch it is that they should watch the other ones first. The movies stories do not depend on each other at all but the character of Indiana Jones is set up a lot more in The Search for the Holy Grail and somewhat in Raiders of the Last Arc. Temple of Doom sort of just jumps straight into the story where as The search for the holy grail does a really good job of setting up Indiana Jones by giving a excerpt from his child hood and showing how Indiana is driven by the same ideals and goals.This is probably one of my top ten favorite films of all time and everyone needs to have seen it.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

As much as Amrish Puri is one of the most loved actors of the indian film industry, I did feel his participation in this movie and playing along with the incorrect depiction speaks of him being spineless.

(Your answer is probably: Well, I don't care about facts, I just care about entertainment!!. This movie is entertaining; I enjoyed this movie, but wait a minute, just think about this - There are a million people in this world who are just as kind as the most benevolent religion of this time and who are willing to forgive/ignore that this movie was made 27 years ago and that it's their fault that the the world was not culturally aware of their religion!!)Let this fact just sink in to your heart!!Steven Spielberg, the director of this movie absolutely knew that this movie would offend some sects in India, but he also knew that that the vast majority of the world would not care about it. So he made it!! even after being repeatedly cautioned by the govt. of India at that time.

Everybody loves an adventure story with a hero, and Indiana Jones is quite an heroic character.That being said, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is atrociously offensive to me, and in my opinion should be offensive to Indians. The movie portrays it's ""Indian"" characters as poor, unfortunate souls, incapable of helping themselves and utterly dependent upon the help of the outside world through either British bound occupiers, or through the help of our ""hero"" Indiana Jones.The other Indian characters are portrayed as conniving, devil like creatures who either toil or work in stalactite laden pits and caves with molten lava, mummified prisoners, and ""snake surprise eating"", chilled monkey brain munching, beetle intestine slurping royalty. The maharajah him or perhaps herself is quite an androgynous character without much of a positive role.I never really realized just how offensive this movie was until I watched it recently. It reminded me of Gone with the Wind, another Hollywood classic that glorifies and romanticizes slavery. I'm sure Hattie McDaniel's relatives are offended by it as well.I don't mean for this review to be spiteful in anyway, and usually I love a good adventure story but I really think this movie is pretty offensive and in my opinion racist.",Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
