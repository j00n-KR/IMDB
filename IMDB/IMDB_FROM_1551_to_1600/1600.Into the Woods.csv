0,TheLittleSongbird,Less than perfect with a very problematic second half but does not deserve anywhere near the amount of hate it's gotten,7,24 January 2015,"Granted, the film was misleadingly advertised(where I came from though the advertising made it very clear that it was a musical) for some people who clearly had no prior knowledge of the source material and, as is apparent in a lot of the reviews here, Stephen Sondheim's music is not for all tastes, so the dislike is understandable. But as someone who's a fan of musicals, one of those who likes Sondheim, who considers Into the Woods as one of his best and as a fan of the production with Bernadette Peters, while it has its problems to me this film was enjoyable. While as said before the dislike is understandable I do think the amount of hatred it's gotten is over-the-top(this is nowhere near the worst movie ever by any stretch of the imagination) and unfair(mostly from people who didn't know it was a musical or those who have a stereotypical view as to what a Disney film should be like).Into the Woods has a very problematic second half, not all of it is so but a lot of it is, enough to make it an issue. The first half was witty, upbeat, colourful and mostly close to the story of the musical, but the second half slackens in pace a little and the tone shifts rather discordantly to something darker and less cohesive due to cutting things that would have made it make more sense. The second act of Into the Woods is dark in the first place(and there are people who do find the second act heavy for them) but not to this extent, never did it feel like two different shows. It also did a much better job balancing any tone shifts, and is funnier and more poignant than in the film version. Agony is hilarious and Children Will Listen evokes a lot of pathos here so the film is not devoid of those qualities, just that they're stronger in the musical, and those qualities would have come stronger here if the second Agony and No More were kept intact. Lilla Crawford is also obnoxiously shrill and a complete blank expressions-wise as Little Red Riding Hood.On the other hand, Into the Woods is great-looking stuff, loved the beautiful but creepy and colourful but foreboding woods setting as well as the cinematography which was a delicious mix of dream-like and macabre. Sondheim's music here has been criticised for being forgettable and samey, criticisms that I do not agree with at all, if anything does repeat itself it's called a motif which Sondheim uses a lot. The score is rousing, beautiful and haunting and of the songs The Last Midnight, Agony and Children Will Listen particularly stand out here, which all have completely different moods to one another. The lyrics are some of Sondheim's smartest and more complex as well, funny as well as meaningful. All the musical numbers are charmingly and cleverly staged, especially Agony and The Last Midnight. Hello Little Girl will be too much for some and the creepiness is a little overdone and disconcerting here, Johnny Depp acts it brilliantly though. Rob Marshall shows great technical skill as a director and captures the mood of the musical more than competently. And apart from Crawford the cast are excellent with Meryl Streep's imposing Witch(she kills The Last Midnight and thrillingly), Chris Pine's hilarious Prince and Emily Blunt's nuanced and heartfelt Baker's Wife. Anna Kendrick is a charming Cinderella, James Corden endears as the Baker, Daniel Huttlestone does admirably despite Jack being written incompletely and Johnny Depp is very memorable, his Wolf is certainly not one to trust, in his short screen time.To conclude, Into the Woods is problematic but doesn't deserve anywhere near the amount of vehement hatred it's gotten on here, and it's far superior to the mediocre at best Annie also from 2014. It's not for everybody but judging from the reviews it's like it's almost illegal to like the film let alone love it. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",Into the Woods
1,Leofwine_draca,Musical failure,3,2 January 2018,"I'd previously watched and love another adaptation of a Stephen Sondheim musical, SWEENEY TODD, so I had high hopes for this fairy tale-based follow-up. Sadly, INTO THE WOODS is a hopeless effort that stalls more often than it succeeds, and much of the failure lies in the poor choice of casting. When two of the leads in your movie are Emily Blunt and James Corden you know you're in trouble, as both are average singers at best and Corden remains an intensely irritating screen presence. Meryl Streep headlines the cast as a goofy witch but seems to be channeling her MAMMA MIA! role a bit too much. The rest of the film strives to mix up elements of various fairy stories including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel, but the effect is slapdash and the story all over the place. Anna Kendrick is bland and her singing voice irritating, although not as much as the brash kid playing Red Riding Hood. Some of the CGI is okay but overall this is a huge missed opportunity for me.",Into the Woods
2,SnoopyStyle,non-stop Broadway music,6,30 June 2015,"Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) cannot conceive a child. The Baker has been cursed by the Witch (Meryl Streep) after his father stole from her garden. She offers to lift the curse if they get her a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn, and a slipper as pure as gold. They go off into the woods. They get the cow from idiot Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) for 5 magic beans that were stolen from the witch. The Baker rescues Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) from the Wolf (Johnny Depp) and she gives him her cape in gratitude. Baker's wife gets the hair from Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) and the slipper from Cinderella (Anna Kendrick).It is non-stop talk-singing Broadway style from the cast. Everybody seems game for it but it does become mind-numbing after awhile. That's not my biggest complaint. The movie reaches a natural ending at about 75 minutes and I made it all the way to that point relatively unscathed. With a little padding, it could have been made into 90 minutes and finish nicely. However the movie goes on an extra trip into the woods which does nothing but grind me down. It's 50 minutes that is better eliminated.",Into the Woods
3,Hitchcoc,One Star........Come On,8,1 January 2015,"Yes, folks. It's a musical. If that's your criticism, I would give ""Alien"" one star because it's a science fiction movie and I don't like them (actually, I do, but you get my point). This is a nicely done rendition of the Sondheim musical. It is an interesting story with a fine cast of contemporary actors. Meryl Streep is outstanding as a sort of everyman witch. Emily Blunt is excellent. The story involves a group of fairy tale characters who have quite a bit of meat on their bones, unlike their inspirations. A baker and his wife find themselves trying to deal with a curse by going into the woods. In the woods are Little Red Riding Hood and her adversary, the wolf, played by Johnny Depp (sounding like a child molester), Jack the beanstalk boy and his long suffering mother, and Cinderella and her supporting cast. It is a black story which makes it not a children's movie. The songs are sophisticated and intense and really appropriate. Not for everyone, but quite a remarkable musical offering. I think people with some intellectuality will at least respect the effort.",Into the Woods
4,Prismark10,The good times and the bad,4,15 July 2016,"Stephen Sondheim's 1987 musical which intermingled various fairy tales of the Bothers Grimm seem rather common in a post Shrek world.Although the Broadway musical has a first act with a traditional fairy tale conventions the second act is more subversive which is toned down in this movie.The biggest problem of course are the musical numbers, Sondheim I am afraid to say in his later years has never been as catchy as Rodgers and Hammerstein, although the latter was his early mentor.The film starts of brightly, director Rob Marshall has certainly Disney-fied the story. There is a satisfying happy ever after ending with Cinderella, Prince Charming, Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Jack, the wicked witch and the baker and his wife. Wait there is still an hour to go.The second half looks at the characters in disillusionment of a world that is not all technicolour but dark as a studio set masquerading as the gloomy forest. Somewhere along the line the films gets lost a little as the second giant arrives, people die and the survivors grieve.Johnny Depp has a sinister and mischievous cameo as the perverted wolf. Chris Pine is rather able as the good but dim Prince Charming, James Corden is whimsical and the heart of the film as the Baker and Meryl Streep dominates visually as the witch.",Into the Woods
5,mark.waltz,The most fractured of all fairy tales.,10,29 December 2014,"Movie versions of Broadway musicals in the past decade have been a majorly mixed bag, technically so brilliant but sometimes a bit dizzying to watch because of high definition effects which take away the intimacy of the original show. From ""Evita"" in 1997 to ""Chicago"" in 2002, followed by ""Hairspray"", ""Mamma Mia!"", ""Phantom"", ""Nine"", ""The Producers"", ""Dreamgirls"", ""Les Miserables"", etc, these shows are now recorded for posterity, some instant classics, others missed opportunities which in reflection will be considered disappointments. The newest of these is ""Into the Woods"", Stephen Sondheim's brilliant late 1980's musical which has seen many revivals and revisals, the latest one just having started an Off Broadway run.I am pleased to say that ""Into the Woods"" has been filmed with a very faithful scope of what audiences saw Bernadette Peters do in 1988, as well as subsequent revivals with Vanessa Williams and Donna Murphy. Having seen three productions (the original national tour with Cleo Laine as well as the later two women in the role of ""the witch next door""), I anxiously awaited the movie where none other than Meryl Streep took on the diva role, a supporting part that stands out in the context of the story because she is the antagonist and the motivation for everything which takes place.Having a huge cult following, ""Into the Woods"" means different things to its many fans, and unfortunately, even way before the movie came out, people were already barking that the differences between the stage production and the movie version were many. Those people were way off base as the movie is as close to the original show as it can possibly be, and the changes that are there were necessary for the narrative to really work, most of the cuts of elements that in retrospective were too stagy to work on film. Only a few songs have been cut, but there are instrumental versions of them included where the songs would have been originally.The cast is uniformly excellent with very little glamorization of them. James Cordern and Emily Blunt are the heart and soul as the baker and his wife, with Lilla Crawford very funny as Little Red Riding Hood, obnoxious enough to create laughs but not to the point of wanting to slap her. Daniel Huttlestone is adorable as little Jack with Tracey Ullman extremely witty as his mother. Anna Kendrick is very moving as Cinderella with Mackenzie Mauzy showing an inner strength previously not utilized in the character of Rapunzel. The comical highlight comes between the two princes (Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen) in their duet, ""Agony"", although I did miss the reprise where they mention several other fairy tale characters not seen here. Christine Baranski, Tammy Blanchard and Lucy Punch are delightfully imperious as the step-mother and step-sisters.As for Meryl Streep, she utilizes her huge talents to build the character of the witch from ugly trouble-making hag to blue-haired fairy princess who is still rather troublesome. Her performance is like that of a volcano, building in heat and sulfur until she finally explodes. Like Margaret Hamilton's witch, she always appears in the oddest of times, exploding with ""The Last Midnight"". Meryl's rap is quite memorable too, although her voice isn't as brassy as the Broadway divas who rocked the rap to pieces. She is heard as well singing ""Children Will Listen"", although unlike the witch in the play, she is only heard, not seen. Fortunately, the photography isn't as dizzying as it could have been, so this doesn't look like ""Harry Potter"", ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" or any of the dozens of other Grimm's Fairy Tale rip-offs of the past decade. What it does succeed in showing is that when done with care, a movie version of a Broadway musical can be faithful and be altered without loosing what made it so great in the first place. For me, ""Into the Woods"" will always be a brilliant musical about daring to face life without fear, that mistakes are necessary in order to grow, and that the metaphoric ""woods"" of our lives must be explored in order to get through the hard times. Bravo, Hollywood, for finally doing Broadway right!",Into the Woods
6,kosmasp,It might hurt a little (read a lot),4,14 September 2015,"Even with the knowledge going in that there would be a lot of singing, I couldn't expect how much of a dread this would be to me. I do acknowledge though that there are people out there who into that stuff and for those this might be more appealing. I still love the actors in it (Anna K., Chris P., Emily B. and so on), but I couldn't bear them singing for that long.It's not only the singing itself, it's the running time of the movie. It easily felt like it was going on forever. And just when you thought you was out ... they sing you back in again. With a twist or two. Because mixing up all those fairy tales wasn't enough, let's make it even more clever ... or ruin it for some. There's a scene where everybody starts blaming each other ... but if you don't like it, just stop watching and don't start blaming others ...",Into the Woods
7,gavin6942,"Great Musical, Rather Weak Plot",6,18 January 2015,"A witch (Meryl Streep) tasks a childless baker and his wife with procuring magical items from classic fairy tales to reverse the curse put on their family tree.Something went very wrong with this film. The first half (the collecting of the items) goes very well. But then everything after slows down, and seems to come from a completely different story. Had it stopped at the halfway point, it would warrant a greater score.And there is no reason that the first half could not have been padded just slightly to get a running time of 90 minutes. Instead, we get 120 minutes with 60 of that being wasted.Streep's Oscar nomination is also odd. There is no denying that she is the greatest living actress and possibly the greatest actress of all time. But this is not one of her best performances. Was the supporting actress category so barren that she got in by default?",Into the Woods
8,lee_eisenberg,through the eyes of a newcomer,8,27 December 2014,"I should start by saying that I had never heard of ""Into the Woods"" until I learned that the movie was going to get released soon. I already knew Stephen Sondheim's work, having seen a stage production of ""Sweeney Todd"" and Tim Burton's movie adaptation thereof. So, I went into the theater with only the information that I had picked up by reading about the movie. Now that I've seen the movie, I'm impressed. This mixture of several classic fairy tales is not a fairy in the common sense of the word. Its overall message is that life is not a fairy tale. The singing and dancing adds up to something more serious than what we expect from musicals and Disney movies.The movie's high quality owes partly to Rob Marshall's (""Chicago"" and ""Memoirs of a Geisha"") clever direction. But Meryl Streep's performance as the witch is what really makes it. It would've been easy to simply make her a wicked witch casting evil spells on people, but she's more complex than that. She has goals and desires just as much as the humans do. Since we understand the witch's motivations, it's possible to care about her. In a way, she's just as human as the people. This is not to ignore the fine performances of the rest of the cast. Anna Kendrick, James Corden, Emily Blunt, Chris Pine, Lilla Crawford and Daniel Huttlestone play their roles perfectly, with great support from Tracey Ullman, Christine Baranski, MacKenzie Mauzy, and Johnny Depp in a brief appearance.In the end, I found it to be a good movie. It's worth noting that this is NOT a movie for the little ones. The movie contains mature undertones and has scenes that might upset tykes. But if you can handle these, then you're sure to enjoy the movie. It's not a masterpiece, but I thought that they did a good job with it. I'm not a fan of musicals at all, but I liked the songs. So go see it.",Into the Woods
9,jboothmillard,Into the Woods,5,22 February 2015,"I heard about this Disney film having four or five fairy tales being mixed together, then I heard it was based on the Broadway musical by Stephen Sondheim (Sweeney Todd), and then it was nominated awards, so ignoring mixed reviews I decided to see it, directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago, Nine, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides). Basically a Baker (James Corden) and his Wife (Golden Globe nominated Emily Blunt) wish for a child but a curse is laid on his family by a Witch (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) who found the Baker's Father (Simon Russell Beale) robbing her garden when his mother was pregnant, the Baker's father also stole beans which caused the Witch's mother to punish her with the curse of ugliness. The Witch will only lift the curse if the Baker and his Wife gather four items that are critical for her, and that she can cannot collect or touch herself: a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn, and a slipper as pure as gold, the only way they may find these items is to go into the woods. The Baker and his Wife come into young Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) who is forced into selling his beloved white cow Milky White, the Baker offers a trade of the cow for magic beans left to him by his father (the beans stolen from the Witch), Jack's Mother (Tracey Ullman) is angry at this trade and throw these beans to the farm ground, these grow into a large beanstalk that leads Jack to the realm of the Giant where he gathers golden objects. Next the Baker meets Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) who is wearing a ruby cape, she is on the way to the house of her Granny (One Foot in the Grave's Annette Crosbie), while being pursued by the Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp), the Baker saves her and Granny from the stomach of the beast, and Red Riding Hood rewards him by giving him her cape. We also see Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) getting away from her Stepmother (Christine Baranski) and stepsisters Florinda (Tammy Blanchard) and Lucinda (Lucy Punch) visiting a magical tree and the spirit of her Mother (Joanna Riding) giving her a sparkling dress and golden slippers, but she keeps running from her Prince (Chris Pine) feeling insecure, and Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy), the Witch's adopted daughter, is secluded in the high tower with no stairs with the longest yellow hair that she lets down to let people up, this goes on until she meets her Prince (Billy Magnussen). After a series of failures and misadventures, the Baker and his Wife have finally gathered the items needed to break the spell, meanwhile the other characters get their ""happy endings"", Cinderella and Rapunzel marry their Princes, Jack and his Mother get riches and he kills the Giant in the sky cutting down the beanstalk, and the Witch drinking a potion created from the gathered items as ingredients regains her youth and beauty. However each ""happily ever after"" is not so happy, the Baker worries he is not a good father for his newborn baby, Cinderella feels indifferent to royal life, Rapunzel is scared of the outside world, and the Witch has lost her powers from being restored. A remaining magic bean grows a second beanstalk, allowing the Giant's Wife (Big School's Frances de la Tour) to climb down and threaten the people of the kingdom if they do not deliver Jack so she can avenge her husband's death, also the characters are haunted by what they did to achieve their ""happy endings"", with Cinderella's Prince kissing the Baker's Wife, she dies fleeing from the Giant's Wife and falling off a cliff, Rapunzel abandons the Witch in spite running off with her Prince, hearing of his infidelity Cinderella breaks up with her Prince, and Granny and Jack's Mother are killed in the Giant's Wife's rampage. In the aftermath the surviving characters debate the morality of handing over Jack, they blame each other for the individual actions that created all the tragedy, the Witch is blamed most of all, she throws away the remaining magic beans, meaning her ugliness returns, and she disappears, so left to their fate the Baker, Cinderella, Jack and Red Riding Hood resolve to kill the threatening Giant's Wife, explaining distraught Red Riding Hood and Jack the morality and retribution of this decision. In the end the Giant's Wife if killed, the characters must move forward with their ruined lives, the Baker in the memory of his Wife is determined to be a good father to his baby, Cinderella leaves her Prince and decides to help the Baker, orphaned Jack and Red Riding Hood live with the Baker and Cinderella, and the Baker begins to tell their story to his son, starting ""Once upon a time..."" Streep received her record breaking nineteenth Oscar nomination for this film, I can sort of see why, she is very good, Corden who has become a Broadway star is suited to his role, Blunt is likable, and the supporting cast members like Kendrick, Pine and Deep do well both singing and acting as well. I can see why this film has mixed reviews, the darker side of the Broadway show has been somewhat subdued, the combined stories are relatively good, the idea of happy endings not staying happy is a good breakaway from the usual fairytale clichés, most of the songs work well with the action, and the special effects and makeup are well put together, it may be a mixed bag, but it's not a bad musical fantasy. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Production Design and Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up & Hair and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. Worth watching!",Into the Woods
10,tavm,Into the Woods is perhaps the best film this holiday season!,10,29 December 2014,"Before I review the movie proper, let me just say that I've never seen this on the stage and I don't think my movie theatre-working friend did either. But we both highly enjoyed this adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical mixing various fairy tales and then instead of a ""happily-ever-after"" vibe being the conclusion, it turns a little tragic and still life-affirming in telling how to keep going in the face of some setbacks. And what a great cast this movie's assembled: Meryl Streep, Christine Baranski, Emily Blunt, Anna Kendrick, Tracey Ullman, Johnny Depp, etc. We both had a great time watching this to the point we rarely talked at all during the whole thing! So on that note, yes, Into the Woods is highly recommended.",Into the Woods
11,edwagreen,***,7,12 September 2015,"As far as the writing is concerned, the film would deserve **** for originality. The idea that the basic time honored fairy tales are brought together is an interesting idea. When each of these tales is resolved after 75 minutes, you would think that the film was over, but you're in for quite a ride.With the destruction of the village, where the groups have lived, it becomes necessary for the groups to coalesce to fight off the destructive giant.As always, Meryl Streep gives her all in this film as well. The constant singing by all the cast becomes tedious as what tends to happen in pictures of this nature. Note that Streep got top billing in the cast, but was nominated for the best supporting actress Oscar.Christine Baranski, as Cinderella's wicked step-mother, gives new dimension to the role. Sometimes, I thought I was seeing the actions of Carol Burnett.I wonder what Grimm of Grimm's fairy tales would say of this production. It is certainly an innovative piece.",Into the Woods
12,studioAT,It gets a little lost in the woods,2,15 December 2016,"When you look at the cast list for this film, combined with the fact that it's based on a highly successful stage show you think you're getting something a lot better then what you end up with.Because sadly 'Into the Woods' has a good premise, but no real oomph about it to make use of the potential.It has it's moments, I thought Anna Kendrick was good, same too could be said for lovable Brit, James Corden, but there were too many slow moments for me that stopped me totally enjoying it.It was too dark to be a Disney movie, too long to hold anyone's interest. I was ultimately disappointed with the film.",Into the Woods
13,Scarecrow-88,Into the Woods,7,27 December 2014,"Wonderfully atmospheric Disney production based on the Sondheim musical is a delightful family film that is certain to be another hit for the company (this is a good companion piece to their other hit, Angelina Jolie-starring ""Maleficent""). It reboots various fairy tale stories (Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Cinderella, Jack and the Bean Stalk), incorporating them together into one film about a couple (James Corden and Emily Blunt, a cute pair) unable to bare children due to the curse of a hideous witch (Meryl Streep, herself cursed with ugliness due to losing magic beans). This witch has a beautiful daughter, Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy, absurdly lovely), with long blond hair, she has trapped away in a tower with no exit. Rapunzel is spotted by a handsome prince (Billy Magnussen) and the two eventually fall in love. You know the story with Cinderella (Anna Kendrick, given nice star treatment among the cast of great names), stuck in the horrid environs of her nasty stepmother and stepsisters, wishing to be free, blessed with an elegant gown and slippers by the spirit of her mother located in the woods at the gravesite where a towering tree now resides. Three nights, she flees the ball, much to the chagrin of a charming prince (played with assured cockiness by Chris Pine, milking his blessed looks with a knowing wink) who wants to marry her. Then there's Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), needing to make some money for his poor widower mother, a cow exchanged for magic beans when he contacts Corden's Baker (Streep's witch demands a ""white as milk"" cow, a lock of ""yellow as corn"" blond hair, golden slipper, and ""red as blood"" cape from the Baker and his wife before three strikes at Midnight as the Moon will be Blue and restore her the beauty taken away), dropped on the ground and releasing a beanstalk to the heavens. Jack steals large coins to get his cow back. Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) encounters ""Mr. Wolf"" (a much too little used Johnny Depp) in the woods, is convinced by him to seek out a nice bouquet of flowers, forcing her to stray off the path against her mother's orders, while traveling to her grandmother's tree home. Wolf will gobble up both of them but Baker may just be in the right place at the right time to save them. As you might expect, the fairy tales reach what appear to be ""happy ever afters"" but Jack's thievery and murder of the giant (coming down the beanstalk for his stolen golden harp) causes a vengeance-seeking wife giant to trample through the woods, villages, and castles looking for the little boy that made her a widow. Lots of songs sung by a game cast bringing their A-game, Streep knows her part takes a lot of oomph and chutzpah while Corden and Blunt must emphasize their determination and frustration endured because of something committed by a thieving patriarch. Jack does a lot of stealing and this causes some repercussions that affect a lot of people. The conclusion of Cinderella's story as it pertains to her prince and bond with Jack, Red Riding Hood, and Baker is a nice surprise which goes in an unexpected direction. Depp is so much fun in his cameo, I wished he had an extended part in the film. One musical number seems so little use of his dynamic screen presence. As can be expected, details regarding the fairy tales are glossed over as ""Into the Woods"" is ultimately about the Baker and his wife trying to secure a pregnancy denied them. Streep's gaining her beauty back and all she has done to those around her due to losing it is a good lesson on the pratfalls of vanity and its destruction and harm towards others. The Gothic beauty of the woods is a character unto itself and most of the action located there gives the film a stunning backdrop for the story that transpires there as numerous fairy tale characters join together to help defeat a major threat to them all. Also incorporated into the movie is David and Goliath from the Bible. Should be another Sondheim megahit and this was wisely released during Christmas to capitalize on the appeal towards the gathering of the family unit. The theater I was in with my kids was a packed house.",Into the Woods
14,preppy-3,Almost successful musical,6,2 January 2015,"I never saw the play on stage so I can't compare this with that. This is basically a musical taking the characters of Little Red Riding Hood, Jack (of Jack and the Beanstalk), Cinderella, Rapunzel, the Baker and his wife, a witch and various princes and having them all interact in amusing ways with songs thrown in. For the most part it works. The songs are good, everyone can sing and act, it looks great and moves quickly. However the movie takes a disastrous turn during the last hour or so. The tone becomes VERY dark, characters act very strangely (especially Chris Pines' prince), likable characters are killed and it just gets depressing. It does have a somewhat happy ending though...but not a fairy tale one.The film has a lot of good things going for it however. As I said all the acting is good but special mention must be made of Meryl Streep (REALLY enjoying herself as a witch), James Corden (as the Baker) and Emily Blunt (as his wife). Those three really get into their roles and their enjoyment rubs off on the audience. Also Cinderellas prince (Chris Pine) and Rapunzels prince (Billy Magnussen) stop the movie with their duet of ""Agony"". So it works half of the time. I just wish it hadn't got so dark at the end.",Into the Woods
15,CinemaSerf,Meryl Streep & Christine Baranski - where was Julie Walters?,5,2 April 2020,"It must have seemed like manna from heaven: a wonderful hybrid story of classic fairy tales and a truly stellar cast to take part in this cinematic adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's classic stage musical. Therein, however, lay many of the problems. Most theatrical performances thrive because the audience knows the limits of the staging and substitutes their imagination for the extra; the cast work together week-after-week (hopefully!) so there is usually a chemistry between them that helps keep the story engaging for those watching. This, on the other hand has all the necessary SFX to render that imagination largely redundant. This leaves us with some over-powering musical numbers that have no understanding of, or sympathy with, their new medium - Lilly Crawford (""Little Red Riding Hood"") positively shrieks her way through her songs with a grating accent that could strip paint. I'm sure I saw Billy Magnussen's uber-coiffured hair slide down over his eyes at one point too! Chris Pine, Emily Blunt and Johnny Depp are all strong in their usual acting habitats, but musical theatre isn't for everyone - and here, it certainly is not for them. Tracey Ullman & Frances de la Tour seem to have a better (if brief) grasp of what is expected, but I am afraid that this just goes to testify that budget + willpower does not turn this particular straw into gold.",Into the Woods
16,writers_reign,Passable Lyrics - Shame About The Music,6,11 January 2015,"Apart from anything later Into The Woods is more or less the only Sondheim musical I haven't seen on the stage. Time was I considered him a viable bridge between the real showwriters - Porter, Kern, Arlen, Loesser, Rodgers etc - and todays' no talent crew, but around the time of Pacific Overtures I begin to grow apart from his growing obsession with pushing the barriers of the musical to breaking point. Whilst he never really was a melodist - even his one bona fide 'hit' Send In The Clowns could hardly be described as a soaring melody - he did used to be able to make a half decent fist of a melody, alas, those days have long gone. The tone is set from the start via the muted, sombre colouring - this is a Musical, man, not a wake. Think of those primary colors that used to fill the frame; okay, we no longer have three-strip Technicolor but we can, surely, offer just a touch of brightness to offset the plodding score. On the other hand it appears to have found its audience so what do I know.",Into the Woods
17,grantss,Decent concept ruined by random plot and irritating music,3,23 September 2016,"A fairy tale musical that combines elements of several well-known fairy tales. A baker and his wife have been cursed by a witch and must obtain four items in order to break the spell. In their odyssey the baker and his wife encounter Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack (of The Beanstalk fame) and Rapunzel.The central concept - weaving four well-known fairy tales around an original plot - was an interesting and novel one. Unfortunately, that's pretty much where almost anything good about this movie ends.After the initial novelty the plot fails to deliver, degenerating into one random scene after another. The concept is the problem, to a degree, as the writers feel obliged to shoehorn the known characters (Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, Jack and Rapunzel) into just about every scenario. Feels very contrived and silly after a while.Worse than the plot is the music. I generally hate musicals (but there are many exceptions) and this is the type of musical that reminds you why you hate musicals. People break into song at the drop of a hat and the music itself doesn't flow naturally from the preceding dialogue. In good musicals, eg The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, Rocky Horror Picture Show, you hardly notice the change from dialogue to music it is so effortless. Then you have the average musical where the songs arrive on cue, with no thought for the context. Into the Woods is a particularly bad example of the latter.So just about every time a song arrives, it jars with the flow of the dialogue and feels shoehorned into the script. What's worse, the songs aren't that good and they're generally sung badly!It could have been worse though - at one stage it looked like this was going down the road of the absolute worst kind of musical - the all-music, no dialogue kind. Memories of trying to get through Les Miserables flashed through my mind. Luckily, Into the Woods isn't as singing-intensive and nails-on-a-blackboard irritating as Les Miserables, but it does give it a run for its money.The cast is jam-packed with stars - Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp, Emily Blunt, Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, Christine Baranski, Tracey Ullman - but all this does is prove that a star-studded cast doesn't necessarily mean a good movie. Considering the all-star line up, I don't know what limited-acting- talent James Corden was doing there... The original actor must have pulled out out at the last minute and the producers were desperate.This all said, there is one rare glimmer of light in the ocean of darkness and irritation that is this movie. While just about every other song in the movie makes you want to leave the room in a hurry, Little Red Riding Hood's songs are quite sweet and funny and her dialogue is sharp. This is all helped by a wonderful, charming, exuberant performance from Lilla Crawford.",Into the Woods

Middling adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim/James Lapine Broadway smash with a star-studded cast in a re-imagining of Grimm's Fairy Tales as an amalgam of familiar characters with decidedly darker (and far more mean-spirited) tones that frankly is a chore and a bore of a musical no thanks to the uninspired direction of Rob Marshall and some truly WTF moments (i.e. Depp's 'costume/make-up' as a lupine pimp come pedophile!)

19,neil-476,I thought Sondheim could write good tunes. Oh well.,7,16 January 2015,"The baker and his wife want a child, but a witch must lift her curse first. To do this, she will need a red cape, a white cow, a golden slipper, and some flaxen hair. Fortunately, Red Riding Hood, Jack (of beanstalk fame), Cinderella, and Rapunzel all live in the neighbourhood, so that's that sorted, then.Adapted from a Broadway show where the songs are written by Stephen Sondheim, this movie plays fast and loose with fairy story tropes, and that's fine by me, I love that sort of thing. And, for the most part, I loved this movie. The story was mostly fun, the cast mostly had fun, it was bright, colourful, and eye-catching, with lots of lovely touches (I particularly liked the way Red Riding Hood kept getting caught with her mouth full early on). So all is good, then.Actually, no, it's not. Many people have said that if the film finished about half an hour earlier, at the point where the traditional ""And they all lived happily ever after"" kicks in for most of the characters, they would have been much happier. Personally, I didn't mind the rather dark and subversive final section, but I do understand how it could spoil the movie for some.What disappointed me most was the songs (with the single exception of Agony, the wonderful and hysterically funny song sung by the two princes at the waterfall). The lyrics were fabulous throughout, but I was underwhelmed by the melodies. The songs weren't dissonant, they were just shapeless. I compared the opening song ""Prologue: Into The Woods"" - scene-setting as the camera roams between the various characters - with ""Belle"" the similar song at the start of Beauty And The Beast. Both have a similar role to play, both are executed in similar ways, both have good lyrics, but ""Belle"" has a memorable melody unlike the equivalent song here. In fact, you aren't going to be humming much when you come out of this other than the 4-note ""Into The Woods"" motif which is repeated innumerable times. And possibly not even that, because I can't remember it less than 24 hours later. Given that these are Sondheim songs, I was enormously disappointed with them.And what was the point of making Rapunzel Baker's sister? Did I miss a payoff there?",Into the Woods
20,evanston_dad,"Not the Definitive Version, But Enjoyable on Its Own Terms",7,4 January 2015,"Nothing about the big screen adaptation of ""Into the Woods"" erases memories of the definitive original Broadway version, but anyone who expects it to deserves to be disappointed. On its own, it's a fairly respectable version of the musical, and my fears that Rob Marshall would destroy it were happily unfounded.The problems that plague the movie of ""Into the Woods"" are those that plague many stage-to-screen adaptations. ""Into the Woods"" was conceived for the stage, and things that work on stage simply don't work on screen unless they're completely re-conceived in cinematic terms. Marshall doesn't do that -- if anything, his problem is he remains too faithful to the stage version, particularly its structure, but he would have been reviled by the musical's die-hard fans if he hadn't, so really he couldn't win either way. Even the original stage version is awkward at times, especially in the second act, and the film highlights the awkwardness that was already there instead of smoothing it over. Characters randomly meander from scene to scene and run into each other for no other purpose than to set up a song or a moral lesson. Removing the character of the narrator, who doubles as the baker's father, removes one of the major thematic plot strings, which the film still tries to retain but in a throwaway manner that blunts its effect. Also, I deeply felt the loss of the song ""No More,"" which now that I've had children myself has become my favorite song of the entire musical. Other excisions are handled more gracefully -- I barely felt the loss of ""Ever After,"" the act 1 finale, and ""So Happy,"" the song that kicks off act 2. The music that remains sounds fantastic, and the film is worth sitting through just to hear the music done justice with full, glorious orchestrations. The singers are much stronger than I expected them to be, especially Meryl Streep, who comes much closer to matching Bernadette Peters' powerhouse voice than I would have given her credit for. I didn't enjoy her performance as much -- she misses much of the humor in the script. Indeed, the entire film seems to have overlooked the fact that the stage version, poignant and powerful as it is, is also incredibly funny. I enjoyed Emily Blunt's performance very much, even if she plays the character of the baker's wife much more gently and warmly than Joanna Gleason did. Gleason was the heart of the original stage version, and Blunt doesn't quite achieve the same feat in the film, but she is one of the more memorable things about it. Her ""Moments in the Woods"" is a high point, just as it is in the stage version. And she and James Corden have terrific chemistry, most notable in their duet, ""It Takes Two.""The other stand out for me was Anna Kendrick's Cinderella. The only moment in the film that improves on the stage version is her rendition of ""On the Steps of the Palace,"" staged creatively by Marshall in a way that uses the medium of film to enhance the stage material, something I wish the movie did more often.There is probably a better screen version of ""Into the Woods"" to be had by the right combination of people, but as long as the original stage version exists on video to watch any time I need my fix, I don't much care that this screen version comes up short. It's certainly good enough to enjoy as long as one doesn't spend its entire running time comparing it to what it could never hope to match.Grade: B+",Into the Woods
21,AlsExGal,An abundance of CGI can't wallpaper over bad music...,4,17 December 2017,"... and please excuse the mixed metaphor.This live-action Disney musical based on the Stephen Sondheim stage production was about as enjoyable for me as a root canal. A mash-up of various fairy tales (Little Red Riding Hood, Jack & the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, Cinderella, etc) set to near-continuous terrible music and slathered in overdone CGI. The all-star cast does their best, I suppose, but the only one who made an impression was Chris Pine as a knowingly shallow Prince Charming. Meryl Streep earned Oscar nomination number 19 for her turn as a witch, and she's okay, if a bit over the top. I usually like Emily Blunt and Anna Kendrick, and they are passable here, with Kendrick's vocal skills put to some small good use. Also appearing are the insufferable James Corden (who's currently busy butchering late night television), a poorly used Tracey Ullman, a couple of annoying kids, and a wasted Johnny Depp. Fans of this stage musical may find more to like, but I pretty much hated every minute of it.",Into the Woods
22,ferguson-6,I Know Things Now,7,23 December 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's a musical, but not a typical musical. It's a fairy tale, but not a typical fairy tale. It's funny, but not a typical comedy. It's a bit frightening, but not a typical monster film. It's filled with lessons of morality and responsibility, but certainly not a typical parable. In fact, there is nothing typical about director Rob Marshall's (Oscar winner for Chicago) screen adaptation of the smash Broadway hit from Stephen Sondheim and James Lupine.The story revolves around 4 classic Fairy Tales: Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, and Cinderella, in a style much more similar in tone to the edgy Brothers Grimm, than the cuddly Walt Disney traditionals. These four are intertwined with the saga of a baker (James Cordon) and his wife (Emily Blunt) who discover they have been unable to have children due to a long ago spell cast by a wicked witch (Meryl Streep). With a secret agenda, the witch offers the couple a way to break the spell, and that's what ties-in the four tales and provides a reason for adventure and song.Filmed seamlessly between an elaborate sound stage and a couple of park locations, the film has a dark and eerie feel to it that's probably too intense for younger children. And much of the dialogue and lyrics is aimed directly at adults and will be a blur to kids. Additionally, in typical Sondheim fashion, the songs aren't catchy and melodic in the manner of most movie musicals  instead the lyrics propel the story and help shape the characters. Oh, and by the way, don't expect any fancy dance sequences – this is pretty serious stuff with plenty of angst amongst the characters.Ms. Streep is extraordinary as the witch (both nasty and beautiful) and does a terrific job with her three main songs. She is especially fun in her entrances and exits, and while wearing the most impactful of all the costumes. Emily Blunt also handles her vocals very well and offers up some of the film's most witty dialogue. Chris Pine (as the Prince) is flat out hilarious, and with a twinkle in his eye, spouts lines such as ""I was raised to be charming, not sincere"". He also shares the screen with Billy Magnussen (playing the younger brother) in the most audacious of the musical numbers, ""Agony"". As Cinderella, Anna Kendrick once again proves she is an exceptionally talented singer, and James Cordon anchors the production as the nice guy village baker we are rooting for.In supporting roles, we have a devilish Johnny Depp whose screen time as the Big Bad Wolf is quite limited, and a perfectly cast Christine Baranski as the evil step-mother in cahoots with her non-Cinderella daughters played by Lucy Punch and Tammy Blanchard. Lilla Crawford is Little Red Riding Hood, and her young age snuffs out much of the innuendo that the Wolf scenes should have provided, and takes the edge off the song ""I Know Things Now"". Daniel Huddlestone is an energetic Jack, and dependable Tracey Ullman plays his frustrated mom. MacKenzie Mauzy captures the awakening of Rapunzel, while Frances de la Tour frightens everyone involved as the agitated (for good reason) Lady Giant.Unconventional is the best description of this production, and there is a group of viewers who will be totally captivated by it, while a much larger group will probably find it too dark and bleak, and lacking the easy charm we have come to expect from movie musicals. However, for those of us in the first group, we will be totally enchanted by the characters, story lines, wry humor, costumes, sets, and songs.",Into the Woods

Meryl Streep plays a witch whose youthfulness has long since fleeted yet she needs four items in order to spin a spell to gain what she once was. James Corden plays a baker and Emily Blunt plays his wife and together they desire a child. The witch challenges them with the task of obtaining a cow (as white as snow), a cloak (as red as blood), a golden strand of hair, and a gold slipper. The cow is owned by young Jack whose mother orders him to sell the cow but he ends up trading it for magic beans. These beans sprout a beanstalk and Jack descends it and steals gold items thus angering a giant. The red cloak is own by Red Riding Hood whose encounter with a wolf leads to an interesting switch around. The gold hair is from Rapunzel whom the witch keeps in a tower until a prince becomes entranced by her. Anna Kendrick plays Cinderella whose gold slipper naturally comes off at the ball and is the sight of a prince, played by Chris Pine who states that he is ""charming, not sincere."" Too dark for young children although the special effects are massive with its eerie woods setting, and the musical numbers are festive and performed with humour and passion. Directed by Rob Marshall who had success with the Oscar winning Chicago, and captures the spirit of the fairy tales.

Rapunzel's hair, Cinderella's slipper, Red Riding Hood's cloak, and a Milky white cow, owned by a boy named Jack....With Sondheim productions, they always have a real dark streak going down the main narrative, and here, it's no different. It's easily one of the the darkest movies Disney has made since Something Wicked This Way Comes, and even though the majority of the mood, and songs, ebb on the light side, the connotation toward violence, and promiscuity, is rife throughout.Although the film is brilliant in many ways, the narrative and the branching of well loved fairy tales is pretty amazing, there were times in the film where the ghost of Sweeney Todd is clearly evident.The music style is obviously there, different songs always referring back to the similar piece of music accompanied by each song, but it's almost comparing the music of Danny Elfman being similar, which isn't a bad thing.Depp is great in his very, very minor role, but again, he is channelling Sweeney, and sounds like Bowie once more.The cast are as reliable as you would expect, Streep is the best thing of course, but Corden, I've never really warmed to the guy, but here, he is truly something, and his troubled Baker is the heart and soul of the film.It's a great family film, maybe a little too dark for children under eight, but there is enough lighter sides of the film, and all the innuendo referring to adultery, and sexual orientation are that subtle, they would fly over youngsters heads, even if the musical number with Pine and his friend is more camp than an Elton John episode of Glee.Fun, dark, and quite lovely in may ways, this would make a great companion piece with The Company Of Wolves, which is also about straying of the path.",Into the Woods
25,phd_travel,Visually grand but the music is weak,5,26 January 2015,This is a visually beautiful production with a mostly good cast. I personally am not a fan of the musical because the music itself is weak - it's lacking in any memorable tune. But the lyrics are sometimes funny and the story has an interesting twist to the traditional fairy tales. It's better than on stage because of the effects and sets that aren't possible on stage. So at least it's fun to watch. Sondheim is a better lyricist than composer.Anna Kendrick and Cinderella has the best voice. She isn't pretty enough but her voice makes up for it. Emily Blunt is surprisingly good and her voice is expressive. Meryl's voice is better than on Mama Mia but still weak in the softer moments. She adds box office draw to the movie but shouldn't be cast in musicals anymore. Nice support from Tammy Blanchard and Lucy Punch as stepsisters and Christine Baranski as the stepmother. Chris Pine as Prince Charming looks a bit scruffy but sang okay.Worth one watch.,Into the Woods

27,gradyharp,'Be careful what you wish for',8,23 April 2015,"Stephen Sondheim's clever, witty and winsome INTO THE WOODS has moved from 1987 Broadway theater to the big screen and it is a successful transition. Few thought the Sondheim/James Lapine piece would make it on film because it is, after all, a musical – a piece that is almost completely sung, with characters who are from fairy tales – a category that can hardly compete with the current gluttonous appetite for loud killer action and potty mouth sexual innuendos and it is not derived from a Marvel comic book. But for those who enjoy theatre, well-composed music, opera and operetta this is a richly rewarding experience. INTO THE WOODS s a modern twist on the beloved Brothers Grimm fairy tales in a musical format that follows the classic tales of Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Rapunzel-all tied together by an original story involving a baker and his wife, their wish to begin a family and their interaction with the witch who has put a curse on them. The cat is outstanding singing their own roles as opposed to having them produced off camera by professional singers. Meryl Streep as the Witch is not only a beautifully developed character but she sings very well indeed. The same can be said for Emily Blunt, James Corden (he IS talented), Anna Kendrick, Daniel Huttlestone (well remembered for his Gavroche in Les Misérables), Christine Baranski, Tracey Ullman, Johnny Depp (always willing to take chances and stretch his abilities), the underused Billy Magnussen, Lilla Crawford, and Chris Pine (as the Prince, with a grossly out of character au courant 5 o'clock shadow beard that breaks the mood of fairy tales)It is a show that either your like or you hate – depending on sensitivity to this medium. But it is so nice to see something creative on the big screen that doesn't depend on body count and car explosions and breasts to maintain the audiences attention. The last part of the story gets a bit Hallmarky, but even that is in keeping with the happily ever after flow of Sondheim's little jewel. Grady Harp, April 15",Into the Woods

30,JamesHitchcock,Don't Tell Me Fairy Tales!,5,10 December 2015,"In English the expression ""fairy tale"" can have two metaphorical meanings. On the one hand it can mean something idyllic as in ""a fairy- tale love story"". On the other hand it can mean something untrue; ""don't tell me fairy tales!"" is a euphemism for ""don't tell me lies!"" ""Into the Woods"" is a film which plays upon these two meanings. It is a fantasy based upon four traditional fairy tales, ""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""Cinderella"", ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", and ""Rapunzel"". Binding these four stories together is a fifth, which seems to be of Sondheim's own invention. It concerns a baker and his wife who are trying to lift a curse placed on them by a witch. In order to do so they need to collect four objects- a white cow, a red cape, a lock of yellow hair and a golden slipper. You can work out for yourself where they find these things. I have never seen the original stage musical on which the film is based, but I understand that in it matters get even more complicated with reference being made to two further stories, ""Snow White"" and ""The Sleeping Beauty"". Despite his great success on Broadway, Stephen Sondheim has never been particularly popular in the cinema. This is only the third film, after ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" and ""Sweeney Todd"", to be based on a Sondheim musical, if by that term is understood a musical for which he wrote both music and lyrics. (He also wrote the lyrics, but not the music, for ""West Side Story"" and ""Gypsy""). ""Into the Woods"" does, however, fit in well with the modern vogue for films which reinterpret traditional fairy tales, often in a ""dark"" or ""adult"" manner; examples include ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", ""Maleficent"" and the Amanda Seyfried ""Little Red Riding Hood"". The film is divided into two acts. In Act I all the stories play out to their expected happy ending. Cinderella and Rapunzel marry their princes (who in this version are brothers), Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are saved from the wolf and Jack kills the giant by cutting down the beanstalk. After a number of setbacks the baker and his wife succeed in assembling the various objects, the curse is lifted and they are rewarded by the birth of a baby boy. And they all live happily ever after.Or rather, they all live happily until the beginning of Act II, when things begin to go wrong. Cinderella's Prince begins an affair with the baker's wife. (The parallels with certain real-life events made me wonder if the heroine should have been named ""Dianarella"" and her rival Mrs Baker-Bowles). Worse still, a second beanstalk grows up enabling the dead giant's wife to come down and terrorise the kingdom in her quest for revenge, killing a couple of the main characters.The film's two biggest names are Meryl Streep and Johnny Depp, but neither is really at their best. Streep confirmed the impression given in ""Mamma Mia!"" that musicals are not really her thing; she apparently once swore that she would never play a witch in a film, and I wished that she had kept her promise. She received a ""Best Supporting Actress"" nomination at the Oscars, presumably on the basis that the Academy now automatically nominates Streep for everything she appears in. Depp's performance as the wolf, whom he plays as a sort of lecherous lounge lizard, is a technically good one, but inappropriate in the context of the film. If might have been bearable if Red Riding Hood had been played as an adult, as she was by Seyfried, but as the character was played by a thirteen year old girl his obvious sexual innuendos seemed distasteful. Of the rest of the cast, the best are probably Emily Blunt as the Baker's Wife and the young Daniel Huttlestone as a cheeky Cockney Jack. Unlike the standard pantomime version of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", Jack is here played as a young child rather than a youth in his late teens or twenties, and he does not end up marrying a princess.I liked ""Sweeney Todd"", both on stage and as a film, but for me ""Into the Woods"" didn't really work on the screen. Sondheim's music is not lyrical and melodious in the manner of earlier composers such as Richard Rogers or even his contemporary Andrew Lloyd-Webber. It is often harsh and uncompromising, designed to complement his sardonic lyrics. In ""Sweeney Todd"" his style seemed well suited to that very dark Gothic fantasy, but in ""Into the Woods"" it seemed wasted on what struck me as a rather pointless film. There is a bit of moralising in Part II about the need to take responsibility for one's actions and about how ""No One Is Alone"" (the title of one of the songs), but cinematic moralising, when it gets too blatant, always puts me in mind of Samuel Goldwyn's dictum that if he wanted to send a message he would use Western Union. As for the film's other moral, that real life is not like a fairy tale, that is not so much a message as a Statement of the Bleeding Obvious. We all knew that anyway. Don't tell me fairy tales. 5/10",Into the Woods
31,lasttimeisaw,a downfall of Rob Marshall,5,26 March 2015,"As a much anticipated movie adaption of a famed Broadway musical, INTO THE WOODS struts in its ""dark treatment"" of the classical fairy tales, namely: Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel and Jack and the Beanstalk, and panders to a more adult-leaning demography. As a matter of fact, it turns out to be really dark, but only because the happenings occur inside the ill-lit woods most of the time, as to the story itself (or maybe pregnancy is a bit too un-fairytale-sy and killing off a main character is a bold move), the noted outlandish elements are majorly compromised by its PG rating, a well-expectedly avaricious manoeuvre from the money-seeking corporate to cash in from as many viewers as possible at the expense of the project's artistic essence. Altogether, Rob Marshall's newest star-studded musical is a ragtag mess fails to connect with audience who are not the devotees of its theatrical archetype.Mostly the film suffers from Marshal's chaotic orchestration, whose post-CHICAGO (2002, 8/10) glory has drastically waned through his own impotence of riding a potent narrative, as stocky as the fairy tales are, to juggle with four of them plus an additional key plot clearly is over-challenging for him (not to mention how to finish off the ultra-fragile giantess - a lovable Frances de la Tour, I know in the entire universe, you're the only choice for this role - especially no prince is available for a slaughter, perhaps a normal slingshot would conveniently work the wonder too), eventually, the movie transpires to be a slapdash hash, reaches its finishing line without leaving any thrilling or poignant aftertaste, instead, viewers would be constantly offended by its heedless hasty which lacks in any logic development even for a fantasy world. A default can get a free pass in a theatre production, but in the media of cinema, it is lameness that inconveniently betrays.One might feel sorry for the cast who are involved in this seemingly promising project (even for Streep, who is the fairest among all and grabs her 20th Oscar nomination for it, but I frankly fear it will cause her more backfire than benefit at this stage, the Streep fatigue seems to reach an impending coagulation, which is not a good sign for her upcoming high- profile films and a sooner-or-later fourth win), they all belt out maximally to be as tuneful as possible, but pitifully musical virtuoso Stephen Sondheim's music numbers are generally bland to seduce our ears, they are all woodenly didactic and the frequent speaking-with- singing devise (which in my opinion greatly spoils Tom Hooper's LES MISERABLES 2012, 6/10) is not a bonus point either. Although the film garners 3 Oscar nominations, but the one for production design shamefully pales in comparison with the latest Disney fare Cinderella (2015, 7/10), the multi-talent Anna Kendrick instantly becomes unglamorous and lukewarm; Chris Pine's chest-baring stunt is the only moment we can squeeze a laughter, although his singing voice is surprisingly good and he is excellent in portraying the prince's narcissism and vainglory. While Corden and Blunt are the authentic leads, who are here to pinpoint the nitty-gritty of life, but being Meryl, her witch is granted with a showy rejuvenation, the fullest emotional arc and the most dazzling exit strategy, this is the real deal corroborates her clout as a film star. Huttlestone as Jack and Crawford as red riding hood both have wonderful voices, yet, their unexciting acting chop can only make then oscillate between being overtly precocious and unreasonably nettlesome, and every so often, both.",Into the Woods

So the baker and his wife set out to obtain the coveted objects and while doing so they cross paths with Cinderella (Kendrick), Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy), Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) and many other classic fairy tale characters. Things take a really dark turn.I respect and enjoy musicals, when they're well made, but this is just painful to sit through. I don't mind that the writers took classic fairy tales and updated them, with a modern dark twist, but I still don't think it's very interesting or funny. The movie feels a lot like a 'one joke' 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' sketch, stretched into an over long movie. The humor is really forced (and cheesy) and the characters do a lot of irrational, pointless things. The songs aren't very good and the third act is just plain boring. It is well acted and nicely filmed though (although it kind of feels like a network TV movie). I really didn't enjoy it much and I definitely don't think it deserves any rave reviews or prestigious award recognition.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/dJ7Sq2i4_Jg",Into the Woods
34,thesar-2,"Voorhees, Where Are You?",2,21 February 2015,"Granted, I am not drawn to musicals, but when I am, it's because they have great songs and a fantastic score. Story is good, as is acting and sets, etc, but it's wonderful lyrics and music to move the action along. Into the Woods simply does not work because, frankly, the songs suck.And this is sad, because the movie's somewhat original direction from multiples of fairy tales and meshing them into a sometimes interesting yarn. That said, every time I wanted to like the movie, it broke out in a terrible musical number that reminded me of the awful (also, Disney) Frozen soundtrack. Okay, the saving grace is, once again, Meryl Streep, but even she isn't masterful. She just does what's needed to be done in her role. And with her caliber, it's fun to watch herand nothing else on screen.The 52 story lines of the film revolve around Mr. and Mrs. Baker and their quest to rid an old curse by means of a scavenger hunt. Along the way, they sorta learn things, fight and inadvertently cause the needless last half of the feature. I exaggerate, but, yeah, there are far too many things happening here to be invested in even a handful of them. I'd almost like the movie had they cut back, to say one main plot surrounded by two side plots. Even with the horrible and completely forgettable songs, I might have invested my interest in any of the characters. Hell, even the bright spot, the witch, played by Streep, was so incidental, I couldn't care less what happened to her.It's too much, too long and far too late to the game, as this Shrek theme of taking old fairy tales and interconnecting them into main theatres is tired now. Maybe they thought the musical aspect would save it. No, it didn't. In fact, after seconds of liking parts, I was back to hating it once they began singing.There is nothing here to recommend and it's an absolute skip. Maybe with a few more re-writes, it might have been decent, but we'll never know. This reminded me of the horrible 2012's Les Misérables with its equally dreadful songs and 24 story lines too many. Skip it!* * *Final thoughts: I lied above. I said the only saving grace was Streep. Actually, I am a dog and loved looking at main character/star, James Corden. He is gorgeous and kept my interest up because of his looks and decent acting. That said, I don't grant movies higher stars due to good looking actors. It's just a nice perk when you're trying to fight your way through a two-hour snoozefest. And believe me, this was incredibly difficult to get to the end without shouting at the screen for it all to be over.",Into the Woods
35,Robert_duder,"Really, really, really....not good?!?!",2,16 February 2015,"Honestly, I sort of assumed Into The Woods was a no lose situation. I mean even if it wasn't amazing, it would at least be entertaining and fun. Its Disney and its full of fun characters and an incredible cast...and Meryl Streep got an Oscar nomination again!! Well if this doesn't prove they'll give Streep an Oscar Nod for anything than nothing will. Another reviewer on the main page said everything perfectly. They called this wretched with a plot befitting a porno. Harsh? Yep but I can't disagree. It was almost painful to watch. The musical score is disgustingly bad, the entire film, characters and plot, are some sort of unintentional spoof of itself. The acting is beyond bad...like ridiculous bad. It isn't funny or charming or cute and I can't imagine a child finding this even remotely entertaining. Its dark in some places and not at all enchanting and honestly, it has the charm of a dead fish. I wouldn't even lay eyes on this film again, I disliked it so much. I am amazing that it bombed so badly in my books but I do also understand why it seemed to fizzle so quickly at the box office. It is completely forgettable and to put together and ensemble cast under a great director and have it fall flat...something is wrong.The cast is a whose who of young Hollywood and talented legends like Streep. Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, James Corden, Emily Blunt, Christine Baranski, Tammy Planchard, Lucy Punch, Tracey Ullman, Johnny Depp, Billy Magnussen, and Meryl Streep of course and some familiar young faces like Lilla Crawford and Daniel Huttlestone (both who are just horrid but everyone is.) The entire cast is god awful...I mean like excruciating. Calling it porn acting would be complimenting them. Every razzie should go to these people. The only thing I can say is that they all have decent singing voices but the songs are so bad and the script so terrible and campy and just awful that their singing doesn't matter. The costumes are campy, the special effects are non-existent...there just isn't any reason to see this film. Its very unfortunate.Rob Marshall is no stranger to musicals. That's why there is even more question and disappointment to the final product. I am desperately trying to find the redemption in this but I have to give up because there just isn't any. It has no magic, no fun, no good story. I don't know if they intended on this being a spoof for adults or if they just unintentionally had fun with this and it comes across as mocking. Into The Woods is a colossal disaster in my book. I will do my best to steer clear of ever seeing it again. And my fingers will not be crossed for Meryl Streep who didn't do anything to up the ante in this cast. Dud. 2/10",Into the Woods
36,ThomasDrufke,"I was raised to be charming, not sincere.",7,27 December 2014,"I'm not a huge musical guy, but the tremendous cast got me excited to see Into the Woods. I have to say it's no Les Miserables, but it's certainly better than Nine, Rob Marshall's last directed musical. It has a lot of charm but not as much pizazz or flamboyance as Les Miserables did. It wont get as many if at all Oscar nominations but it is a fun film to go see this time of year.I really think all of the performances are great. Emily Blunt is one of my favorite actresses and she absolutely kills it as the Baker's wife. Her and her husband are two of the only real life like people amongst this extraordinary fairy tale. It involves just about all of the classic woods fairy tales we have all come to love. Anna Kendrick plays Cinderella, although a much different one than we are familiar with. That's one of the things I enjoyed about this film was the unpredictability of it. They twist many of the stories we all know to make them fresh which I can appreciate. Chris Pine plays Prince Charming and has many of the best comedic moments throughout the film. I wasn't too keen on his character to begin with but he definitely grew on me.Meryl Streep is good as usual but I don't think worthy of her Golden Globe nomination. Even the child actors I thought were serviceable. I don't know how much they adjusted the actor's voices or if at all, but I thought they really did this music justice. It definitely had me humming it for awhile after. But most of my problems with the film involve pacing and the length. I haven't seen the play but did it need to be 2 hours? I just didn't think the content was good enough to add that extra 30 minutes on at the end. I felt the second half dragged a little bit considering most of the films fun involved seeing all of these characters pop up for the first time. It's a film that many can enjoy but only a few will love. I will say that Johnny Depp's role and performance was pointless. His wolf came off borderline child molester-ish.+Blunt +Pine's surprising comedic talent +Catchy music +Twist on known fairy tales -Pacing & length -Depp 7.0/10",Into the Woods
37,MLDinTN,a musically needs to have...,6,17 August 2015,"at least one catchy tone, but IMO this movie didn't. Plus midway through the movie, the singing just stops and I completely forgot it was supposed to be a musically till toward the end when the characters started singing again.The film intertwines 4 fairy tales. A baker and his wife must find Jack and the beanstalk's white cow, Red Riding Hood's red coat, Cinderella's slipper, and Rapunzel's golden hair. They need these things to give to a witch to lift the curse that won't allow them to have children, also the witch wants them so she can be youthful again.So, they accomplish all this and then the move heads in a different, dark direction for the fairy tales. They aren't all happy endings.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK but needed better songs. The costumes were good though. I would recommend it if you want to see a different type of movie.",Into the Woods
38,cricketbat,Mostly unimpressive,4,28 December 2018,"Confession: I've never been a big fan of Into the Woods, so my lukewarm feelings on this film adaptation are because of the source material, not because of the performances or production. In fact, some of the songs, costumes and sets in this movie are impressive. Nevertheless, I remain mostly unimpressed with this Sondheim musical.",Into the Woods
39,lesleyharris30,"A Musical Delight with a Dedicated Cast,",7,1 November 2015,"Into the Woods is good movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's a very well directed and beautifully choreographed musical with some stunning numbers, it's a dark story that becomes increasingly less kid friendly as the story continues, it surprises me that Disney let this movie be as true to the Broadway play as it did. The biggest issue with the film is that it's too loyal to the musical, it feels like an actual play you are watching in a theatre too often, which is not how a film should feel, it should have had it's own original vibe that differentiates itself from the play so that watching either of them is a totally different experience. Though I like the darkness in it for the most part, the final act is very surreal for a PG film, they certainly could have toned this down a little, it's actually quite startling to watch even for an adult, definitely sent a shiver down my spine. The cast is terrific, with the likes of Meryl Streep, Anna Kendrick, Emily Blunt, Chris Pine and a short but sweet appearance from Johnny Depp, they all deliver original performances that is that is very unique from anything they've done before, but I thought the best acting came from British comedian James Corden, he may not be a household name but he manages to hold his ground against this star studded cast, he's the most relatable character, the Baker is very human and he never loses a sense of confusion and resentment for the situation he was in, I sympathized with this character the most and was very impressed with Corden. While it has its flaws and may not take advantage of its cast as much as it could have, Into the Woods is a lyrical and visual delight that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good musical or fantasy. In order to get a curse reverse, a couple are forced by an evil witch to gather several items from various fairy tales. Best Performance: James Corden Worst Performance: Billy Magnussen",Into the Woods
40,Irishchatter,Yawn.....,2,3 January 2016,"I have decided to watch this film today and I thought it was going to be alright to watch. After 30 minutes, I just had to stop the movie, it was just plain boring and dull. I felt there was no feeling involved with the characters. Even though I liked Johnny Depps costume, I would rather if he was a real wolf then a humanoid. It's like he'll just wear it as if the whole movie was a Halloween Party, it just looked completely ridiculous!Red Riding Hood wasn't even suppose to be selfish or a wimp, she was meant to be kind and have a sweet personality. Lilla Crawford didn't even show us any light at all, she just showed us no light. She would be better in other roles but definitely this was one of her worst ones!The music was alright but too overrated. Yeah it's a musical but it isn't like the other well known Disney movies where you get the song stuck in your head. They have put on far too much on the soundtrack, maybe more talking, less singing would've made this film work well!Also couldn't they have picked a better narrator then James Corden, he doesn't have a good voice to be the speaker in my opinion. They could've got someone better with a beautiful voice like Jude Law or anybody who you would be able to fall in love! I'm glad I haven't watched the rest of the movie and I'm not gonna bother too, it'll waste more of my time!",Into the Woods
41,inkblot11,"Amazing art direction, lovely music, and a great cast are this film's assets; I did NOT like the ending",7,6 January 2016,"In a fairy tale village near a deep, dark woods, several familiar folks make their homes. Jack and his mother (Tracy Ullman) live on the outskirts, in poverty. Ma sends J to the market to sell their aging cow. Little Red Riding Hood is on her way to Grandma's and visits the town bake shop, where a lovely wife (Emily Blunt) and handsome husband (James Corbin) wait on guests. The couple longs to have a child and fails to notice that LRRH tricks them out of some baked goods. Nearby, poor Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) does all the grudge work for her demanding stepmother (Christine Baranski) and two spoiled stepsisters. Although the birds help her complete tasks, Stepmommy won't let Cindy go the Festival where the Prince (Chris Pine) will choose a bride. Finally, Rapunzel, with her long glorious hair, lives in the tower where her mother, the Witch (Meryl Streep) keeps her guarded. What a surprise, a handsome Prince, not the same one of the festival, spies her letting down her hair. But, horrors! As the baker's wife is wishing for a child, again, the Witch comes calling and explains the curse she put on the family and why. To break it, and conceive a child, the doughy couple must find four specific items and bring them to the Witch. As the duo enter the woods to search for them, LRRH is there meeting the wolf (Johnny Depp, quite wonderful), Jack is walking his cow to market and Rapunzel may let it all hang out for a new climber. Will the woods be a place where everyone's dreams will come true? This lovely musical, originally a Broadway show by the great Sondheim, has some qualities that are indeed admirable. The plot is clever, the art direction is breathtaking, the tunes are golden, and the cast is just dandy. For half the film, indeed, the action hums along and mesmerizes. But, alas, once the Witch receives her items, my view, and transforms herself back into a pretty lady, the movie just goes flat. Especially depressing to me was the departure from Happily ever after into We'll get by as best we can. Yes, I understand that this is more realistic but it will likely throw viewers for a loop. Therefore, do make an evening's appointment to go Into The Woods but be aware that all that glitters may not be totally golden.",Into the Woods
42,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,16 March 2015,"Into the WoodsSinging in the woods is an excellent way to ward off bears and horny wild men.Mind you, the melodies in this musical are there to convey emotions.The Witch (Meryl Streep) that cursed his family promises to reverse it if the Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) bring her a cow, a cape, some hair and a slipper.So they head into the woods where they meet Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) and Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy), all of who possess an item.But each mark is experiencing a personal crisis and the duo gets entangled in each ordeal.With its capable cast, familiar fairy tale themes and subversive lyrics, this Disney adaptation of the stage show will please musical fanatics but likely bore those who prefer dialogue.Unfortunately, unlike the Broadway musical, movie audiences cannot get on stage and sing along.

43,atlasmb,A Well-Made Musical Featuring a Tremendous Cast,8,28 December 2014,"What. A. Cast. I could detail the performance of every actor in this film, but I will just say that the talent is amazing. And just when you think Meryl Streep can't show us anything that will enhance her already amazing career, she pulls off this performance. When listening to her sing, Julie Andrews even came to mind. Unbelievable.As for the story itself, ""Into the Woods"" is a mash-up of the traditional fairy tales. In the first third of the film, the characters are established and we learn what they are tasked to do. In the second third, there is a resolution. But the film turns from good to great in the third section, where the story turns from traditional tracks to new territory, where the characters change from fairy tale beings to human beings.Being a musical, this film is not for everyone. And Sondheim is not for everyone. Many of his songs are more about the words than the music and, thus, are not as hummable as what you would find in ""Phantom of the Opera"". The visuals are terrific. The special effects are convincing. Rob Marshall really has created another world, where not all fairy tales come true but everything seems possible.",Into the Woods
44,slightlymad22,Anna Kendrick Is A Delight In Enjoyable Musical,7,24 March 2018,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Into The WoodsDespite seeing positive reviews, I skipped this in cinemas, as I just thought it was more of the same from Depp!! I have to say I was wrong, as I seriously enjoyed it. I enjoy a good musical anyway and I love Anna Kendrick, so I am slightly biased.I think Anna Kendrick is a great actress (see Up In The Air) but I tend to not love her movies, and usually only make it through them, due to me having a weird crush on her!! She is not obviously attractive, but she has a certain something about her. She does have a great voice, but she seems to be stuck making Pitch Perfect sequels and things like Mr Right and Get A Job, when she is capable of so much more. One of my main problems with this is, it just tries to incorporate too many subplots!! Like with Dark Shadows trying to get years worth of storylines from the tv show in to one movie. This is the same!! Truthfully you could have almost removed the entire Emily Blunt character sub plot from the movie and it would not be missed!! There is just too much going on.But I do enjoy it!! James Corden is fine and (one of the nicest celebs I have ever met) as is Chris Pine, sending himself up!! though I was surprised Meryl Streep got an Oscar nod here. As for Depp, he only has two scenes, and less than 5 minutes screen time. Here is his main one. Singing a seriously creepy song that more than hints at something creepier..... or maybe it's just me!! Lol All the songs are pretty catchy, and I watch this pretty often with my girlfriends daughter. Into The Woods grossed $128 million at the domestic box office to end 2014 as the 23rd highest grossing movie of the year!!",Into the Woods
45,paulclaassen,An acquired taste.,6,17 June 2018,"A wonderful cast indeed, and a number of popular fairy tales entwined, but I couldn't help feeling that I was watching a stage play instead of a movie. At times it felt the film was moving in circles, with a sense of deja vu more often than not. I also found the singing just a tad too much, and too drawn out at times. All in all it was a good production, I suppose, but this is an acquired taste, and it just did not tickle my palate. It became too repetitive and boring.",Into the Woods
46,filipemanuelneto,A very pleasant surprise.,9,28 December 2017,"Usually, I advise people (friends, family, etc.) to find out more about a movie before they watch it. But there is no rule without exception, so I confess that, this time, I made the mistake of watching this film without do it, last Christmas Eve, with my family, before the traditional Midnight Mass. I knew, however, that it was a Disney movie and it had a star cast with many respected names. It was a ""quality guarantee"", I reasoned. However, it didn't take many minutes to realize that it was a musical. Was that a problem? Not at all. I like any good movie, including musicals, so I will not be bored because it's a musical and I didn't know it.Only now, after some reading, I realize that it's the adaptation of an American Broadway musical which I've obviously never seen. Very few Broadway musicals are brought to the stage here in Portugal. I cannot compare it with the original material but, giving credit to the opinions I read, it seems that it was able to honor the play, which is always positive. So, let's go to the movie itself.The movie mixes a few traditional fairy tales (""Cinderella"", ""Rapunzel"", ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", ""Little Red Riding Hood"") into a single story, deconstructing them and trying to convey a message: we should be careful about what is said to the children. I don't understand the need for this! All these tales have their own morals and I see no harm in any of them. You see, ""Cinderella"" teaches us to be patient and not to ""pay evil with evil"", because we will be rewarded in the future; ""Rapunzel"" teaches us to obey our parents and teaches also parents not to prevent their children from discovering the world and learn to defend themselves; ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" teaches us to be clever, not to be deceived, but also to be bold when it's needed. ""Little Red Riding Hood"" may be the most controversial because of its sexual connotation, but it also teaches us to obey our parents, not to trust unknown people. Are any of these things bad for a child's education? Why dismantle these stories and warn parents about them? There are much more serious things happening to our children under our noses... the technology addiction, the inability of our children to live without being attached to their cell phones or even the high-calorie food we give them are much more serious problems than any children's tale could be.I also heard that the original play was darker, with a more adult approach and potentially inappropriate for children. I understand that, and I believe Disney has made an effort to adapt these content to an audience that, it's known, will have children. And I think that was a very difficult task because I read that play was very good and popular, and it's hard to fiddle with something that has a legion of fans behind, willing to defend it tooth and nail. Anyway, it's a different and original story, much closer to the original tales by Perrault and Grimm, and Disney needs needs to challenge herself. At that point, the movie hit it right.Meryl Streep is extraordinary. A consecrated star, a movie icon, a film dame, but still has physical agility and mental openness to make movies like that! Great voice, great interpretation, what talent! It's worth watching the film just to see her strength; Anna Kendrick made a decent Cinderella and has a good voice but I expected more... sometimes, her was left in the cast; Emily Blunt was very well and has a melodious and elegant voice... she helped to reinforce the weight of the female characters; Tracey Ullman also did a good job; Johnny Depp is always good at this kind of characters, he already has experience and has a good voice too; I didn't know James Corden, but he was the most striking and interesting male actor in the film... he has a good voice and has managed to show some very pleasant psychological complexity; Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen were equally up to their challenge, even though their characters are quite disposable. Looking at the young cast, Lilla Crawford deserves a standing ovation.. this young promise has an excellent voice and it was truly delightful to see her perform. Daniel Huttlestone is not far behind, but his character wasn't as lively and cheerful. The rest of the cast simply did what they should when they should.The technical aspects also don't deserve a negative criticism. As usual in this studio, everything was meticulously thought out. Scenarios were realistic and even CGI, when it was needed, was excellent and looked real, much better than in many action movies out there. I'm still thinking how they did the forest! The costumes also don't disappoint anyone and everything is perfectly in line with what we see in these stories. Maybe I could rethink the costumes of the two princes, I think they were too contemporary, but it's nothing serious. Finally, one last word to speak about soundtrack and the songs. As far as I've been reading, most of them have been imported directly from the musical. They're very beautiful songs, we cannot deny it. It's not that kind of song that stays in our ear days after we see the movie... but it's lively, sometimes quite emotional, always perfectly in line with everything else. There is a certain harmony in all these details that gives beauty to the film as a whole.I conclude by saying that this film was very pleasing to me, it was a pleasant Christmas surprise and it pleased my family too. Okay, it's not a conventional Disney movie, it has some pretty dark moments, but life is that too. And I did not see anything so offensive to children! We watch much worse movies, buy video games full of blood and killings for our children... and then we complain about this movie? If we want to protect our children we must start by imposing rules in our own homes. Time to sleep, time to study, time to watch TV, rules to use the cell phone or computer. It's not what I see in most of my friends' homes that have kids. They rule more than their parents. It's easier for a stressed parent, who is tired to work, give everything the child asks in order to avoid a discussion or a tantrum. When that changes, then you can worry about the movies.",Into the Woods

48,leonblackwood,I couldn't take the annoying singing throughout the movie! 3/10,3,24 May 2015,"Review: I really didn't like this movie at all! As soon as the annoying singing starts, my brain completely switched off and I didn't pay that much attention to what was going on. The acting wasn't bad, especially from Meryl Streep but I really couldn't get into it. I think that it's about a couple whose house is cursed by a wicked witch so they can't have a baby. She gives them a quest to pick up certain items so she gain back her beauty and release them from the curse so they can have a baby. I understood that part of the movie but I really couldn't take the singing which primarily explained the plot. I was really impressed with James Corden, who played a major role in the film but after watching Annie for over 2 hours, I really picked the wrong movies to watch this weekend. On the plus side, the film does look quite good and some of the CGI wasn't bad but I honestly think that it was the hype surrounding the movie which gave it such a big profit. Basically, this movie was a big disappointment but I'm sure that there are many families that will thoroughly enjoy it. Terrible!Round-Up: The director, Rob Marshall, must have thought that he had won the lottery with this cast. His previous movies, which include Chicago, Pirates of the Caribbean: In Stranger Tides and Memoirs Of A Geisha were extremely big projects for someone who has only made 8 movies in his career. He must be highly respected in Hollywood because he has been trusted to take on some big projects, even though he hasn't made that many movies. I should have known what to expect from this film because it does say that it's a musical in the adverts but I was hoping that there was going to be catchy songs, for adults and kids. How wrong was I! Anyway, the all star cast showed professionalism through the whole film and the chemistry between Blunt and Cordon really did work but it has to get the thumbs down from me. Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $213millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their magical/adventure musicals about a couple who has to release a from there house by collecting items for a witch, so they can have a baby. 3/10",Into the Woods

The stories are well known and the approach of mixing some of them together works imo well.Anyway, Into the Woods is no masterpiece but still a good watch for your eyes and a good to okay listening for your ears.

50,Ed-Shullivan,"Sadly, this is not one of the many Disney classics that will stand the test of time",4,14 January 2015,"My wife really wanted to see this Disney film due to the strong cast that had signed up. As for me, I was persuaded to go see it simply on the Disney label alone and I assumed it should be great. Man, was I disappointed from the opening music score of ""Into the Woods"", to the long and drawn out ending. The majority of the film actually takes place in the woods and the story book characters such as Little Red Riding Hood, the Big Bad Wolf, Jack and his white cow and his bean stalk,Rapunzel, Cinderella, Cinderella's mean aunt and two spoiled cousins and not one but ""two"" Prince's and of course the wicked witch are all included in the story line. As well we have a baker and his wife who have been cursed by the witch who will only break the spell she placed on them if they agree to go in to the woods and acquire four distinct items to conjure up her secret potion, one item is to be taken away from each of the story books main characters.The single mono tone music continued throughout the film, of course sung to different lyrics and by different characters which irritated me to no end and in my opinion killed the films chance for any level of success even more than the confusing story line. Children under the age of 12 will be so confused and bored. I felt that Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, Christine Baranski and Meryl Streep performed poorly. The two characters who I felt scored well were the charming Emily Blunt who played the town bakers' wife without child, and mega star Johnny Depp as the Big Bad Wolf, even if his part came off as some kind of creepy pedophile chasing the pre-teen Little Red Riding Hood.In summary, not only was I bored to death, but the continual singing of the characters using the same mono tone as the opening score ""Into the Woods"" was crying out to me ""please end soon"". Then when the ending did come it was so pitiful that I had to assume that the editors tried several different endings and came up with what they thought was the best they could do. Ohhhhh, were they so wrong.This was a Disney downer of epic proportions. I give it a 4 out of 10 with credit to Emily Blunt and Johnny Depp for raising the bar a bit off of the floor. It is my humble opinion that the overall 6.2 IMDb rating is based on a blitz by the tens of thousands of artists and professionals who have a stake in this film and not because they truly liked it. Pay more attention to the hundreds of reviewers like me who took the time to critique the film and warn people that the Disney name has failed to save Into The Woods from going ""Into The Waste Bin"".UPDATE CHALLENGE *** as of September 02, 2016 *** UPDATE CHALLENGEApproximately two years have elapsed since I wrote the above review and having just now read all the subsequent IMDb reviews, I noticed approximately 4 out of 5 of my fellow IMDb reviewers also rated the film with a 4 out of 10 ...or lower rating. Yet the overall IMDb score remains at an unexpected (higher) average rating of 6.0 by the 101,884 reviewers? These rating numbers just do not add up? Would you agree with me? They certainly do not reflect the majority of negative comments made by the majority of the existing 779 IMDb reviewers. I recommend that all of my fellow IMDb reviewers who have taken the time to score INTO THE WOODS and especially the existing 779 IMDb USER reviews who provided a review for INTO THE WOODS should do what I did and select the appropriate YES or NO against each and every IMDb review with honesty as to how you felt this film was received. Collectively, I believe if the true accuracy of the general viewing audience rated each of the available USER REVIEWS with your honest ""YES or NO"" rating maybe, just maybe IMDb may decide to review their analytical (FORMULAS) tables before publishing an overall films score.No doubt, the majority of all the magical Disney films produced over the past seven (7) decades are deserving of a very high overall IMDb score, but based on the majority of the existing 779 IMDb USER REVIEWS to date being rated between 1 and 4 for the film INTO THE WOODS, I fail to see how INTO THE WOODS is rated as 6.0 from 101,884 IMDb users? Fellow IMDb reviewers I encourage you to read and then update each and everyone of the existing 779 IMDb USER REVIEWS and set the record straight for this undeserved higher than expected rating.",Into the Woods
51,matthewssilverhammer,Decent Amount of Affable Fun,4,2 January 2015,"ItW is a novel concept: flesh out the ubiquitous fairy tales we all know, throw them together, and give them more humanity, humor, and honesty than they've ever had. It's an idea that could garner quirky praise or tiresome groans. ItW gets a bit of both. Starting as a stage production (probably a more fitting medium for the story), Marshall's film adaptation suffers from some pretty weak direction and some identity problems, but otherwise reads like an odd, imperfect little gem. It's old timey fun, with bombastic sets, well-pitched over-the-top performances, and a light tone. So even though it's a bit muddy, ItW manages to find its footing in simply being good-natured fun. The plot is all the stories we grew up with cleverly woven into one comedic-musical epic. Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Rapunzel intertwine, full of great and inspired self-awareness, questioning the overly simple morals we seem to force out of possibly more complex narratives. The result is unique and unpredictable, supported by a fantastic cast (Kendrick as a flaky Cinderella and Pine as dim-wittedly pompous Prince Charming stand out). Throw in some truly genius Sonndheim songs, it's hard to swallow that this didn't end up better than it is. Unfortunately, director Marshall doesn't quite have control of his material. There is a LOT to juggle, and while the shrewd writing mostly shines through, many of the vignettes and characters aren't handled with enough style or grace. One can't help but wonder what a more sophisticated auteur-director could do with the amazing source material. Still, ItW is a decent amount of affable fun.",Into the Woods
52,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A likable movie musical in a time when movie musicals are becoming less likable,7,26 December 2014,"How I've never seen a stage version of Stephen Sondheim's ""Into the Woods"" is still a head-scratcher. My high school theatre department put on the twisted fairy tale the year after I graduated (much to my disappointment) and it has eluded me ever since. The point, excuse my digression, is it's very rare for me to go into a movie musical knowing very little of the show, but after seeing the film and chatting with those who have seen the show, it's clear director Rob Marshall and Disney's take delivers the very qualities that made the stage musical a hit.It helps to know that James Lapine, who wrote the book of the musical, wrote this screenplay. Even though he doesn't have final say in the film, there's no criticizing the movie's loyalty to the source material. This is not a Disney-fied version despite the marketing-savvy casting moves of Meryl Streep as the Witch and Johnny Depp as the Wolf. This is every bit as dark, fantastical, quirky and unusual as fans of the show have led me to expect.""Into the Woods"" is an amalgamation of Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk and Rapunzel all centered around the story of a Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) who discover they cannot have a child because a witch (Streep) put a curse on the Baker's father many years ago. The only way to reverse it, she says, is to go into the woods and retrieve her a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn and a slipper as pure as gold. So off they go into the woods, as do the fairy tale characters whom they seek.This is not some what it looks like: a fun super mash-up of classic stories. Rather, it's a way to explore the human truths of the fairy tale genre as Sondheim does so beautifully in his lyrics. Everything about ""Into the Woods"" is just a bit off from what you'd expect: not too whimsical, not too intellectual, not too dark and scary, not too childish, etc. It lives in this gray area, which makes it totally unique as a work of art, albeit a bit frustrating for the movies, where audiences like to see exactly what they expect to see. Yet there seems to be ""just enough"" of each of these elements to make ""Into the Woods"" a likable film for all.Although few are as skilled as Marshall at effectively filming a musical performance for the big screen, so much of the credit for what makes ""Into the Woods"" enjoyable is the cast. Streep, for example, has precisely the gravitas needed for the Witch, and it's exciting to watch such a venerated actress taking on a peculiar character. She's really the tip of the iceberg though. Blunt and Anna Kendrick (who plays Cinderella) are two of the best and most versatile actresses of their generation, and they have pipes to boot; Corden, little-known but rising quickly, strikes a terrific balance of humor, pity and heart; Youngsters Daniel Huttlestone (Jack) and Lilla Crawford (Little Red Riding Hood) are terrific finds; and although with less significant roles, Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen as the princes get the film's most entertaining musical number in ""Agony."" Each of these actors connects with and owns the lyrics, which are the heart of the story and the true magic of ""Into the Woods,"" but in the wrong hands (on the wrong tongues?) can feel inaccessible or superfluous. Cinderella's song ""On the Steps of the Palace,"" for example, is her over-analyzing and being indecisive about whether (for the third time) she should run away from her Prince. It's lyrical word vomit, and while Kendrick doesn't turn it into pure gold, she effortlessly communicates her character's inner albeit excessive dilemma and makes Sondheim's point that just because in fairy tales girls are supposed to fall in love with charming princes, doesn't mean they should run off with them without a second thought.In this example it's also easy to see that ""Into the Woods"" can get a bit wordy and boring. It's a fairy tale story, so we expect something breezy and entertaining, not something existential and overbearing. As much as you can appreciate how Lapine and Sondheim have challenged the notion of fairy tales by turning them around on the audience, at some points it just gets boring. The film's third act, when ""happily ever after"" gets turned on its head, for example, is a test of patience, even though without it, the story would have no meaning and the film would therefore become artistically pointless.This problem doesn't seem to be unique to the film, but rather, has followed the show to the big screen. All the cinematic elements work nicely here from visual effects to Colleen Atwood's costumes; this is certainly the type of story that truly stands to benefit from escaping the confines of a stage. Even so, Marshall doesn't use that as license to overdo it; he gives us tastes of visual effects here and there. In a sense, this is staying true to the musical, because it's not supposed to be a pure entertainment piece.""Into the Woods"" doesn't get better on the silver screen, but it clearly doesn't get worse, as most fans of stage musicals fear when their favorites get adapted. I might not be able to speak from experience, but what was a likable albeit slow musical according to my ""sources"" has become a likable albeit slow film. Considering ""Into the Woods"" has a very specific message and style, the fact that Marshall and Disney honor that is something deserving of some praise.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

53,lisafordeay,Way too much singing and very dark for a Disney movie but I enjoyed bits of it,5,18 January 2015,"Into The Woods tells the tale of a Baker(James Corden)and his wife(Emily Blunt)who are desperate to have a baby,so a witch(Meryl Streep)offers them their wish unless they give her four items from four of the Brother Grimn charcthers; Rapunzel's hair(Makenzie Mausy),Red Riding Hood's red cape(Lilla Crawford),Jack's cow(from Jack and The Beanstalk played by Daniel Huttlestone)and Cinderella's golden slipper(not the crystal glass slipper played by Anna Kendrick)in order to remove the curse and grant the baker and his wife's wish. This Broadway styled movie which ran from since the late 80s is packed with over 22 songs(I am not kidding here 22 songs are in this movie so be prepared).The cast is grand I think Chris Pine would make a great Broadway singer eventually as he sounded like Gerard Butler from The Phantom Of The Opera when he sings in the film. Also I liked how they did Rapunzel's original story in this film(unlike my all time favourite Tangled which made the film more enjoyable and entertaining,whereas the real Rapunzel story is dark and boring and bland). I liked how you see the prince being blind and Rapunzel's tears brings back his vision again,as well as Meryl Streep singing the song Stay With Me which was really beautiful and slightly heartwarming,and of course the baker's brother was Rapunzel's father making the baker Rapunzel's uncle. Its not the best film of the year in my opinion as there was way to many songs that were in one ear and out the other,so don't go expecting memorable music cause you aren't going to be hearing memorable music here. Also there was a few parts that I found absolutely stupid,like Rapunzel's hair growing long twice,or Cinderella's prince kissing another woman(the bakers wife) and Johnny Depp not in the movie long enough and posing as a granny and eating Red Riding Hood and her own grandma and you never see him again once you are seeing the film.Overall if you are looking for a cute fluffy fairy-tale with that Disney formula you aren't going to find it here as the premise to this film is stupid,but the backgrounds and the costumes are really well done. Also Rapunzel is NOWHERE as interesting as Mandy Moore's version in Tangled(I know I am mentioning this movie far too much in this review but im just saying she is better than Mausy's Rapunzel).5.8/10",Into the Woods
54,jtindahouse,Needed a bigger star to make it bearable,4,29 January 2015,"This movie was always going to be tough viewing for me. I don't really like musicals at the best of times, let alone in the format of four children's stories combined into one. So you could understand my complete and utter delight when Johnny Depp popped up on the screen to save the day. You can also understand my complete and utter despair when his role was over and done with no more than five minutes later. Unfortunately it was this that made me very aware of what this film was missing - a great actor in the lead role to carry the film.Meryl Streep did her best to save things, and admittedly she was very good in her role (having been nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role at the Academy Awards for her performance) but she was never going to be enough to save this. Baker was the character that demanded a great actor like Depp. James Corden simply was not up to the task and the movie pays for it. Many a poorly made children's film has been saved my the likes of Jim Carrey or Robin WIlliams bringing the lead character to life and making it, if nothing else, a fun watch.It also drags on for about half an hour too long and forgets far too often to include some obvious humour for the audience's relief. I'm no expert but the singing in most scenes was nothing special. Chris Pine was a nice surprise for me singing-wise. He seemed to have the most character in his voice and a pleasant tone. Overall this really was a miss for me. Without Streep and Pine I really would be battling to find positives for it. I can't see a lot of children enjoying it and their poor parents who take them along probably won't find it all that enjoyable either.",Into the Woods
55,stevendbeard,Different Take on Fairy Tales,6,26 December 2014,"I saw ""Into the Woods"", starring Meryl Streep-Hope Springs, The Devil Wears Prada; Emily Blunt-Looper, The Devil Wears Prada; James Corden- Begin Again, The Three Musketeers_2011; Anna Kendrick-Pitch Perfect, the Twilight movies and Johnny Depp-The Lone Ranger_2013, A Nightmare on Elm Street_1984.This is a musical based on a 1987 Broadway play. The music is by Stephen Sondheim, who did the original play's music and it's directed by Rob Marshall-Pirates of the Caribbean:On Stranger Tides & Chicago. I'm not much on musicals but this one does have an interesting take on the old fairy tales-I think that is why my wife wanted to see it. James plays a baker in an old English village and Emily is his wife. They are trying to have a baby but so far, no luck. It seems that a curse has been put on the couple and that is why they can not have children. Meryl plays a witch that promises she can lift the curse, but she needs four items to assist in her spell: a cow, a red cloak, a silver slipper and some gold colored hair. This is where the fairy tales collide into a nice little tale of familiarity, involving Jack-and the bean stalk-Red riding hood, Cinderella and Rapunzel. Anna plays Cinderella and Johnny plays the big bad wolf-but Johnny does not have very much screen time-I would guess about 5-10 minutes. It's rated ""Pg"" for violence, action and some suggestive material and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes. If you are into musicals, you should enjoy it. I would probably buy it on DVD.",Into the Woods
56,meeza,Into the Bad with Into the Woods,3,8 April 2016,"This is the best musical I have ever seen! Wait, wait! That was just a fairy tale because the movie musical ""Into the Woods"" is wood-in you have it, one of the worst movies I have ever witnessed. Man, this movie stunk! Director Rob Marshall's film focuses on integrating several classic fairy tales into a story set in the woods. The fairy tales that are featured here are: Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, and The Big Bad Bore. OK, maybe not the latter one but this what this movie was. ""Into the Woods"" stars James Corden and Emily Blunt as the Baker and the Baker's wife; they want to have a Fabulous Baker Baby Boy, but in order to do that they must provide a Wicked Witch a few things that will help her become young again. The Wicked Witch is played by Meryl Streep. Then somehow- Cinderella, Rapunzel, Jack & the Beanstalk, and Little Red Riding Hood get integrated in the narrative. The entire movie is all bad, but the third act is even more atrocious when a Giant Woman comes into the woods and causes havoc; could not be worse than the havoc it did on my attention level. In a film filed with plenty of misfires, there could not have been a more giant mistake than this Giant Woman. Rob Marshall's plan in helming this picture was a big bad woof of a cinematic action. The movie's music was redundant as all the songs sounded alike, sorry I am sounding like a broken record on how bad was this movie. And let me not get started on the ridiculous screenplay. The acting ensemble was totally delirium-fused with overacting. I have no idea why Streep got Award nomination love for her performance as the Wicked Witch. Anna Kendrick seemed bored in her portrayal as Cinderella. Chris Pine's singing was not too charming in his role as Cinderella's Prince. If you blinked, you would have missed Johnny Depp's very brief big-bad-work as the Big Bad Wolf. Blunt and Corden overcooked their performances as the Baker and his wife. Tracey Ullman as Jack's mother was the only role that had fair game in this mess of a movie meshed with fairy tales. So yea! You have been warned! Please do not get ""Into the Woods""!!! * Failure",Into the Woods
57,alindsay-al,A below average musical,4,28 October 2015,"I have heard quite a bit of polarising reviews on this film and I have finally seen it and yeah this film is not that good. The premise sees a couple who have been cursed by a witch so they must enter the woods to lift the curse. Anna Kendrick is mainly known for her other music roles in the pitch perfect films and she was alright in this film. She sings really well and you buy her as Cinderella but the problem is that her character doesn't really have much depth to her at all. Emily blunt was pretty good as the bakers wife and she was probably the best character in the film. Meryl streep is also pretty good in this film even though at times you can clearly tell that she is overacting. But there are some not so good performances, James corden plays the baker and I just think he was miscast in this film. I didn't care about his character and I actually didn't like his performance. Also the kids really bugged me in this film as they didn't really add anything to the film. The story is not good either, it clearly tries to do too much and introduces way too many characters that in the end don't matter. The film could have ended at a certain point and it would have felt more complete but it tries to keep going and it ends up becoming boring. The script has some decent dramatic dialogue in it but obviously it goes crazy with the amount of singing. The style is pretty dark which I found interesting and some of the songs were pretty good. But there is way too many much singing and it ends up all sounding the same and becoming repetitive. Overall this is a below average film that unless your a big musical fan you can skip.",Into the Woods
58,estebangonzalez10,It could've ended a lot sooner than it did,5,14 January 2015,"""Stay a child while you can be a child.""Based on the stage musical written and composed by James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim, Into the Woods has been adapted to the big screen by Rob Marshall without losing its stagy feel to it. Marshall has had success with musicals in the past (Annie, Chicago), but he also had his misses (Nine), so this wasn't something new for him. Into the Woods seemed to have an interesting premise considering it mashes up several familiar children stories (Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Rapunzel, and Little Red Riding Hood) and gives it a twist. I went into this film knowing nothing at all about the popular stage play so I won't be comparing it to the original material. What I can say however is that the film is rather predictable during the first hour and it all of a sudden takes a darker twist during the last forty minutes. That twist should have been the most interesting part of the film, but I actually ended up enjoying the first half of the film much more despite the predictable story. When the film felt like it was wrapping up at about 80 minutes (which would've been a perfect running time for me) it decided to go on and that is where I felt the story drag and found myself checking my watch every five minutes. The twist didn't work at all and didn't have the effect I expected it to. I understood what the story was trying to do by sort of focusing on what actually happens after the happily ever after but it never goes anywhere with that premise in this adaptation. They either shouldn't have included that final act or they should've made it much darker, but since this is a Disney production aimed towards children they couldn't actually do so. I would've enjoyed Into the Woods more if it ended when it seemed to do so, but those final forty minutes were unbearable. The performances and the music are the highlight of this film. Despite not having many catchy songs they are all well performed and sometimes they even overlapped with each other during some scenes. The composition was actually pretty complicated, but it was effective. The cast in this film is amazing. Having Meryl Streep in the titular role as a witch was the best decision that the executives made for Into the Woods. She delivers, but it is Emily Blunt who steals the movie. She is great in this film. Other strong performances from Anna Kendrick, James Corden, Tracey Ullman, and Chris Pine elevate the material. They all have great singing voices and there are some memorable moments as well (Anna Kendrick singing a very difficult song as she is running away from the Prince and Pine singing ""Agony"" and delivering a rare funny moment). I didn't really enjoy the performance from the kids played by Daniel Huttlestone and Lilla Crawford. Crawford never convinces as Red Riding Hood and she does have an important role in this film. Johnny Depp doesn't get much screen time, but he doesn't stand out either as the Wolf. The performances and the set design are the best thing about Into the Woods, but the story really hurt it and I wasn't a fan.",Into the Woods

60,r96sk,Overall it disappoints due to its poor pacing and gappy plot,6,14 November 2020,"Too drawn out, 90 minutes might've been perfect.I like the idea of 'Into the Woods', with its mash-up of numerous fairy tales from 'Cinderella' to 'Little Red Riding Hood' to 'Jack and the Beanstalk' to 'Rapunzel'. I'd also say the musical pieces are enjoyable across the opening 20-30 minutes, which are nice and energetic.However, from the midway point things start chugging down to a snail's pace. The novelty of the premise begins to wear thin, as it becomes clear that there isn't much more to tell - despite a load of the 125 minute run time still remaining. I will say, though, the look of the film is pleasant.I do also rate the casting. James Corden seems to split opinion online, but I've always liked him; having watched and enjoyed him since his career took off with UK TV's 'Gavin & Stacey'. Emily Blunt and Johnny Depp are two of my favourite actors, while Meryl Streep and Anna Kendrick are strong casts. I like Chris Pine too, but he's iffy in this.In conclusion, I almost found entertainment with this but overall it disappoints due to its poor pacing and gappy plot.",Into the Woods

Too bad, because they viewed this triumph of Disney through a preconceived filter. I have never seen the stage production so this is my only way to see 'Into the Woods'.In my opinion this is one of those ""You can't go wrong movies"" because it is pure entertainment with fine music, songs, sets, costumes and best of all each actor shines brightly in their performance.",Into the Woods
62,MissSimonetta,A compromised film,6,2 August 2021,"I do think one's enjoyment of this film might be dependent upon how you feel about the stage show. I adore the original show: I was captivated by a high school production when I was a child and I have listened to the original cast recording of the Broadway version many times. Most of the time, movie versions of musicals do not compare to the stage versions. In modern film musicals particularly, there is some weird realism fetish, right to the point where they'll cast people who cannot sing because dubbing in an enjoyable singing voice is apparently a no-no (see Russell Crowe in LES MIS).Luckily, the singing in INTO THE WOODS is not the problem-- everyone sounds good and the acting is mostly solid, if not spectacular. No, the problems are all in the adaptation of the original story. Disney clearly wanted to make this as marketable to a wide variety of people as possible to the point where they were willing to strip out the complicated elements of the show. The sexual themes are the most savaged, particularly in the case of Red Riding Hood and the Baker's Wife.The writing gets very muddled in Act 2 all around. Character motivations aren't established as well in the movie. For example, Rapunzel is never killed off, which throws the Witch's motivations out of whack. It all feels so choppy and underdone, a half-hearted attempt at adult ambiguity without willing to go all the way.Visually, the movie is flat. I get that stage to film adaptations can be difficult, but the woods never seem like anything more than a big movie soundstage shot in those ugly blue filters that TWILIGHT helped make infamous. Onstage, the woods do not need to have a complicated set because theater can afford to be abstract and ask the audience to contribute to the scene with their imaginations. On film, such meagerness just looks cheap, especially since so much money clearly went to the stars and the costumes.Quite a letdown, all things considered. If you haven't seen the stage show, you might think differently and I admit that is a handicap I brought with me.",Into the Woods
63,3xHCCH,Merry Mash-Up of Fairy tales,8,29 January 2015,"""Into the Woods"" is a musical play with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by James Lapine. It made its Broadway debut on November 5, 1987, when it won several Tony Awards, including Best Score, Best Book, and Best Actress in a Musical (Joanna Gleason). Bernadette Peters memorably portrayed the Witch, singing the main song for which the show is known,""Children Will Listen.""A baker and his wife was cursed childless by a vengeful wicked witch. The witch asks for four special items in order to break the spell. The couple crosses paths with various Brothers Grimm fairy tale characters, like Little Red Riding Hood, Jack (and the Beanstalk), Rapunzel, and Cinderella in their quest. Unfortunately, the merry mix-up of circumstances still do not seem to work in their favor. Will they be able to meet the witch's deadline and finally get the child they had long been waiting for? Will everyone be getting their happily-ever- after?Understandably, owing to the fantasy nature of this story, film is expected to be an ideal medium for the tale to unfold. This film version was just begging to be done. Now, thanks to Disney, the dream of the original show's many fans is finally a reality. I had seen a local production of the play many years ago and I remember I liked it very much. The all-star cast assembled as well as the awards buzz around it made me very excited to see it.Director Rob Marshall had worked on film versions of three other Broadway hits before with mixed results. His first directorial job was the TV version of ""Annie"" in 1999, winning Emmys. He hit the major jackpot with ""Chicago"" in 2002, going on to win the Oscar for Best Picture and five other categories, nominated for 7 more. His interpretation of ""Nine"" (2009) though did not go too well, but it still earned him four Oscar nominations. ""Into the Woods"" gets three nominations: Supporting Actress, Production Design and Costume Design (by Colleen Atwood, who already won Oscars for her work in ""Chicago"", ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"").James Corden plays the Baker, yet another kindly gentle musical man in his list of characters much similar to those he played in ""Begin Again"" and "" One Chance."" He projects real goodness on his face, making him fit for this role. Emily Blunt not only displays her talents for drama and comedy, but also surprises us with her singing prowess in her role as Baker's Wife. This was a far departure from her other big role in 2014, that of the futuristic battle heroine in ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" proving her versatility.Meryl Streep earns yet another Oscar nomination (Best Supporting Actress) for her role as the Witch. This gives her a grand total of 19 nominations from the Academy, for which she has won three. Ms. Streep goes all over the top in her performance here. That she can sing is not a surprise anymore since she took on ""Mamma Mia."" I think she could get a nomination in whatever film she is in really if the role is unique enough, even though it is not really one of her best.Anna Kendrick plays Cinderella, with Chris Pine as her Prince Charming and Christine Baranski as her Stepmother. If you have read the original Grimm version of Cinderella and how gruesome the shoe fitting went, this was how it was done here. Johnny Depp plays the Big Bad Wolf to Lilla Crawford's Little Red Riding Hood. Their first encounter where the Wolf singing ""This Little Girl"" was supposedly tamed down from the original stage version but it was still very uncomfortable to watch. The first half of the film was so much fun to watch with all the action so cleanly edited together the complex story of intertwining fairy tales flowed very smoothly and hilariously. Fun and momentum bogs down quite a bit, making time pass a little more slowly in the stranger, more darkly contemplative second half. Anyhow for me, this is one entertaining movie overall. However, those not familiar with with the original play and its music may not like it as much as I did, or even flat out hate it. 8/10.",Into the Woods
64,aharmas,Imploding Fairy Tales,8,1 January 2015,"A few years ago Terry Gilliam tried to give us his perspective about The Grimm Fairy Tales, and disappointingly, we ended up with a boring tale, with no wit or heart. Damon, Ledger, and Belluci were involved, and no sparks flew. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" and Coppola were magic together. Who would have imagined that the complex Sondheim approach would turn his ""Into the Woods"" into an entertaining film, with the right touch of humor, spectacle, and special effects. Purists will complain about some of the theatrical elements being edited out, but the solid cast, the excellent production values, and the clever screenplay make this film achieve what it was meant to be: a twisted reworking of some pretty dark material that has been sanitized way too much in recent adaptations.Here we have a witch introduce a yarn which combines the fates of Jack, Cinderella, Rapunzel and a couple of princes with that wolf and his red-hooded friend. For the most part, I liked the way all the stories came together, giving us an amusing quest which had a fairly normal couple searching for some special items in order to achieve happiness.Soon, the baker's wife is after golden slippers, yellow hair, blood red fabric, and a white cow. When you see the movie, everything makes sense, but what you don't expect is all the complications along the way, the humor injected by the interaction of some vain and short-tempered characters, and how human nature can be really dark when people want something really badly.The worst qualities stand out, and we have vanity, lust, greed, impulsiveness, and plain carelessness, among others. We get to hear the rich's dilemmas, about young maiden's dreams, and how close we're to acting stupid if given enough room. Jack makes all kinds of dumb moves, and Cinderella couldn't see reality if someone told her to her face. You'd think the resolution would be pretty dark, and no one would learn anything, but in a a style reminiscent of ""The Return of the King"", it takes a while for come to that understanding and see what the lesson is.Is there a happily ever after end? endings? It all depends on how you look at it. Did any one really learn anything by the end of the catastrophic second act? It'll be up to the viewer to judge if each character deserved his/her fate, or anyone deserved a second chance? Much of your decision will be based on your appreciation of the lyrics which help explain the mindset of everyone singing. Plenty of the events are shown visually, and some of them are stunning, but it's the singing that reveals what is going on. People might not see things the same way again, literally in the case of Rapunzel, a prince, and a couple of evil stepsisters. What do you get about the way mothers look like at the end?

It just got so confusing and tried pretty hard to be a Disney tale. There is a saying that the Broadway musicals do not transform into the screen really good.

67,Samiam3,"Delightfully non-Disney, but not great (or even good)",6,1 June 2017,"""The woods are just trees, the trees are just wood,""or so the characters sing, trying to convince themselves that there is nothing to fear in the endless forest into which they all verdure. In fact the woods are as dour and creepy as is required for a fairy tale. Unfortunately some of that bleakness seeps into the personality of the whole movie.I give director Rob Marshall credit for not making a movie that is delightful and plushy or child pandering (as one would fear from a Disney Production.) As far as music goes, some numbers land and some don't. Red Riding Hood has the voice of An American Idol reject, And Jack's Cockney accent doesn't do him any favours on ""Giants in the Sky"". Merryl Streep fairs better, as does Anna Kendrick. Chris Pine does a nice satirical version of ""Agony"", in which he busts out his pecs in the bright sunlight. The movie needs more sunlight.It also needs more humour. A lot of the musical's memorable one liners get lost in these woods. Everyone takes themselves too seriously. As the movie unfolds, a feeling starts to emerge that the production was either being stingy with money or didn't have enough. I wasn't expecting to see glitter or gloss everywhere, but the exterior of Prince Charming's castle looks as barren and prehistoric as Orson Welles' Macbeth. Johnny Deep as the wolf is just a guy with party store make up and rubber paws.In terms of acting the best performances are Emily Blunt and James Corden as the Baker and his wife. The story ends with the visually underwhelming slaying of the Giant's wife and the ghost of the slain baker's wife coming to comfort her husband. Marshall opts for the same kind of quiet last note as his film Nine. When it comes to musicals however, less is not more. I am relieved that this did not turn into a fiasco trying to outdo its source material. In fact it does the opposite. It ignores a number of aspects that made Into the Woods worthy of being source material in the first place.",Into the Woods
68,jadepietro,A Little Lost in the Woods,7,2 January 2015,"This film is recommended.Into the Woods is so very thrilling, so wildly alive, at least, halfway through the woods. In the first hour, the film stays its merry course with its satirical mash-up of fairy tales. The ""happily ever"" factor works so seamlessly and the integral blending of story and music are in perfect alignment, making the film a truly enjoyable comic romp. But it's the ""after"" section, the complete turnaround in the plot, when the film loses its way (just as it did for me with the stage production). The more sinister elements of the story overtake its characters and their choices. Retribution must be paid. Tough love for everyone! The entire tone of the film shifts abruptly as despair and sadness befall every character. The uplift becomes oppressively a downer. (I know that that was the intent of Stephen Sondheim & its creator, James Lapine, but it all seems so forced in both versions.) Yet, following the characters and their quests with its Sondheim score more than atones for some small missteps and misconceptions by its filmmakers.Into the Woods is a mash-up of fairy tale characters (Cinderella, Jack of beanstalk fame, Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood, etc.) whose lives intersect as they get lost in the woods. A baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) are sent on a mission by a witch (Meryl Streep) to reverse a curse in order to have a child. They go on a scavenger hunt to retrieve four items: a glass slipper, a red cape, some yellow hair, and a white cow. Along the way, they meet princes (Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen, overdoing their dimwitted and narcissistic best to full comic effect), evil stepmothers and stepdaughters (Christine Baranski, Tammy Blanchard, and Lucy Punch) and the Big Bad Wolf (a miscast Johnny Depp, once again hamming it up as a creepy zoot-suited lascivious Tex Avery cartoon which is jarringly out-of- sync with the rest of the movie.) Marshall's overall concept of the wolf and Depp's poorly sung execution is so misguided, in its physical look and a desperate performance lacking no comic edge, that it stops the movie cold. The film does begin with a wonderfully staged prologue introducing all of these well known storybook characters who recount their desires and wishes in marvelous song. The score remains one of Sondheim's strongest and his clever wordplay adds to the delight of the filmgoing experience. Director Rob Marshall shows off his musical skills and shapes the film with lavish production values, fluid editing, and strong performances (for the most part, more on that later). Marshall shrewdly allows the songs to move the action without sacrificing the story or character's motives. One can quibble about some of the songs omitted from the film adaptation, especially the haunting No More (instrumental only?), but the film is generally faithful to the Broadway production, even if some of the darker story elements have been toned down. The film is performed with much style and flair by its cast. Blunt and Cordon are extremely effective as the married couple wanting a family but losing themselves in the process. Both actors bring vulnerability and pathos to their roles, plus powerful voices to their characters. They are the heart of the film, as it should be. The other subplots have mixed results in performances, from the worse being aforementioned Depp's shady wolf to the perfect duo of Pine & Magnussen (Their duet, Agony, is the film's highlight.) Streep is very strong as the witch, dealing with Sondheim's patter songs most bewitchingly. She does a lovely job with the ballads as well. Solid support is also given by MacKenzie Mauzy, Lilla Crawford and Daniel Huttlestone. Tracey Ullman as Jack's mother is sadly underused. ￼ Into the Woods may get too Grimm for the younger set and too solemn at the journey's end for the older crowd, but this walk through the forest is mostly a delightful musical adventure led by Marshall and his talented crew.

69,Seraphion,"Interesting concept, too bad it has bad development and execution",6,11 January 2015,"The movie tells an original story of a baker and his wife longing for a child. A witch had cursed their family tree due to losing her beauty when she lost her beans to the baker's father stealing them. To undo the curse they must get items the witch demanded; a white cow, corn yellow hair, a gold slipper, and a red cape. The baker turn out to have the magic beans and the witch is actually the person who put Rapunzel in the tower at the first place. The baker and his wife trade Jack's cow with the beans and one of them gets grown and Jack steals a golden egg as the tale goes. Red Riding Hood gets swayed from her way and gets eaten by the wolf but the baker saves her so she gave her cape to him.Cinderella gets the help she needs and goes to the castle and runs from the prince as the tale goes, but repeat that three times, with her giving the other slipper to the baker's wife. Another prince, brother to Cinderella's prince, meets Rapunzel and tells his brother about her, with the baker's wife eaves dropping not far away. The baker's wife tricked Rapunzel into throwing her hair down and the baker's wife cuts and take a chunk of them. Eventually Jack kills the giant chasing him by cutting down the beanstalk, Rapunzel flees the tower with the prince, Cinderella goes to marry her prince, and the baker gets all items gathered. The baker's family gets a child and the witch regains her beauty. But another beanstalk had grown and the giant's wife terrorize the kingdom demanding revenge at Jack. Her steps create quakes and ravages the woods. The characters gets separated and blame each other. They reunite and cooperate to trick and kill the giant's wife. With his wife not returning due to falling to her death, the baker welcomes Jack, Red Riding Hood, and Cinderella to live with him and his baby. The story concept is interesting and looks promising at first. After all those lucky, and not so lucky, shots of fairy tale modern day twists in Red Riding Hood (2011), Jack the Giant Slayer (2013), Hansel and Gretel (2012), Snow White and the Hunstman (2012), and even Maleficent (2014), a sort of Avenegers-like movie concept for this somewhat forced shared universe of the classic fairy tales is just waiting there to be executed.But alas, the promise only existed at the concept level. The further development and execution rips away the essence of the fairy tales and twist this movie into something that is only a reminiscent of the original stories. He dark overall mood, coupled with the constant musical tune in literally almost every line of the dialog makes the movie feels boring from the very early point. Add this with the fact that the movie is two hours long and most of the story is basically predictable due to the popularity of the original tales, this movie loses the audience's interest fast while they are watching.Except for the witch, the baker and his wife, the characters don't need any more intricate character building scenes, thanks to their already popular individual stories. This movie rally takes advantage of that, setting the fairy tales right into motion after the initial first song. But the combined story means there has to be compromise here and there, and this is where the story makes its fault. The Cinderella story gets to be extended weirdly into repeating the stroke of midnight part three times, whereas Little Red Riding Hood completes very early on. Rapunzel gets to be distorted strangely and Jack's beanstalk gets to grow twice. There's clearly imbalanced development concerning the tales.The acting is a nice overall if you view the movie as a musical play performance. But as a cinema movie, the acting just feels like a standard acting overall work. With all the talents in this movie, that level of overall is really surprising. Meryl Streep's performance is a worthy mentionable for me, but the other stars' acting sees nothing special from itself.A score of 5 out of 10 is just deserving from me for Into The Woods (2014). A recommendation is a so-so from me, although it's more weighted to the 'no' side. Honestly it's been quite disappointing when compared to my expectations.",Into the Woods

71,rgkarim,"A World Come to Life, but Lacking",7,26 December 2014,"When you think of Disney, what comes to mind? Most likely it's animated classics, where song and adventure come to life in some anthropomorphized creature that saves the day, or more recently A Frozen tundra with copious singing. So when you see a movie like Into The Woods coming to theaters, you might be thinking another film that follows the formula. Not the case my friends. Into the Woods comes from a musical, where the story is told through song rather than heart to hear dialogue. This movie is filled to the brim with musical numbers, with some character breaking out into song to describe an adventure, or often discussing their emotional turmoil. I won't lie that this isn't my favorite soundtrack, many of the songs sounding the same to me, but it has some character in terms of jokes and emotion that gave the film an edge. Unfortunately, i got annoyed with the songs and their use as a substitution for actually showing other scenes. The world itself is crafted beautifully, the woods brought to life in a manner no stage show can ever mimic. Marshall and team breathed life into the land, using the movie magic to give the inanimate forest a monster like quality that at first seems innocent, but then tears open its maws of darkness. This makes for a perfect arena to test our characters morals, and the darkness is a nice break from the usual sunshine and daisies theme Disney likes to do. However, the vague ending and story gaps didn't do it for me in this film, and left me a little disappointed after all the dark hell I went through. Many of the characters would disappear at times, and many of their tales ended abruptly without so much as a look to where they ended up. Overall, this film is a decent musical, but I think it is best left on stage. The world is beautiful, but Marshall I think lost some pertinent details in his adaptation, and the film lost the fun of the stage show. Again, this is not the stereotypical Disney many of you are hoping it to be, but if you are up for a little dark edge this winter give it a shot.",Into the Woods
72,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Into the Woods,5,26 December 2014,"Johnny Depp has always been known to play weirdos or freaks on camera. 2014's Into the Woods is just another film catering to his fixation for such fodder. His role in ""Woods"" hightails the fictional Big Bad Wolf and he's on and off the screen faster than a speeding bullet. Does his five minutes of fame really matter though? Not so much. He's just another pawn in this hyperactive mess of a movie that feels more like a stage play than anything else. Characters break into song relentlessly bringing the two hour proceedings at times, to a screeching halt. As I attended a sold out, Christmas Day showing, I thought I should be waiting for riggers to dart across the stage. I also thought the curtains were going to go down after each act, and then I found myself yearning for muted applause from the audience. Oh and I was bored for most of the vehicle's running time. Bottom line: After seeing Into the Woods, I realized that musicals belong in the theater, not in popcorn- munching multiplexes. You won't get a more truer statement from me anywhere.Granted, this is a flick based on a musical by Stephen Sondheim (he adapted 2007's Sweeney Todd) and a book by James Lapine. Rob Marshall (he shot 2002's highly energized, Chicago) takes on the reins as director and he inconsistently tries to weave four fairy tales (""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""Cinderella"", ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", and ""Rapunzel"") into something an audience can follow. Bully for that. He provides Into the Woods with a lush, dangerous look only to have his editor (Wyatt Smith) appear to be on holiday. Too many characters fade in and out, too many scenes don't gel from one to the next, and the songs all sound the same (I heard that's the case with most musicals so count me out on seeing any more of them in the future). In truth, this is a clusterfunk of gigantic proportions, a sort of sabotage on the part of the actors/actresses who truly give it their best effort (Meryl Streep as a witch, kills it and should get her umpteenth Academy Award nomination). They can all sing, they obviously can act, but their jumbled story lines are wasted upon us, the audience. Oh and the script forces everyone to say ""into the woods"" about a million times throughout. I guess this is catered to the ticket buyer who is not misconstrued by the film's title (ha-ha).Now with Into the Words almost becoming a virtual, continuous loop of characters breaking out into song, most of the pieces (examples would be ""Prologue: Into the Woods"", ""It Takes Two"", and ""Magic Beans""), have the same refrain, the same rondo, and virtually the same stanza (musical terms that involve repetition). This became a nuisance. There was one sequence however, where the cast members exhibited impeccable timing and I was impressed to know how they actually pulled it off. If you take in a viewing and listen for the movement, ""Your Fault"", you'll know exactly what I mean.Regardless, this wannabe critical darling is almost too intense to harness a PG rating (what with the implied notion of people's toes getting amputated and evil birds attacking two woman causing them to go completely blind). And with its elaborate cast (including Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick, Emily Blunt, and Tracey Ullman), I expected Rob Marshall and crew to right the ship. Negatory. Into the Woods is out of bounds with its incoherency and choppy narrative. Halfway through it, I wanted to leave the theater to go home and have a stiff drink.Of note: When the final credits for ""Woods"" came up, I heard about ten to fifteen people clapping. My ten year old nephew who also attended the screening, asked why they were clapping. My sentiments exactly.",Into the Woods
73,rannynm,Best Filmed Music Since Rob Marshall's Chicago!,10,14 January 2015,"I confess that I binge listened to the soundtrack before seeing this film and was thoroughly impressed with the vocals. It got me excited going to the screening. I also admit that I am a fan of the Broadway musical. I've seen the play this film is based on starring Bernadette Peters, Vanessa Williams and Phylicia Rashad. All three have played the witch. I have watched Johanna Gleeson light up the stage with energy, charm and humor. I noticed every change, subtraction and addition in the cinematic adaptation and I must say, this film is a triumph. It has wit, humor, emotion, magic and music - all the makings of a great musical. The first fifteen minutes, the prologue, is edited with such vivacity and rhythm that you are immediately engulfed into the stories and the action. Then, Director Rob Marshall slowly starts to focus on the rhythms and details of each individual story. From the Baker and his wife, to Little Red Riding Hood, to Jack, to the Witch and Cinderella. All their stories are told with the same passion and intent as the others, each with their individual flair. Yet somehow Marshall is able to have each story fit perfectly into the grand puzzle that is Into the Woods.I could rave on and on about Sondheim's score. His scores always have a sort of, inside joke sound to them. It's as if Sondheim knows something we don't know when he composes. There is an obvious humor and wit in Sondheim's score of Into the Woods, but it is the lyrics that tell the story. James Lapine, who wrote the screenplay and the libretto for the Broadway musical, makes some interesting changes for the film version. Fans of the musical will recognize the changes immediately and they may or may not like them. I personally liked them. For those who've never seen or even heard the Broadway version, this film will entertain and even touch them.Meryl Streep, is the best Witch I've seen. The finest actress of all-time gives The Witch a portrayal big enough to fit Rob Marshall's theatrical style, but is subtle enough for us to understand her. Her solo Stay With Me is one of the best scenes in the whole movie and one of the best acted scenes this year. But, it is the show-stopping number of Last Midnight that will leave a lasting impression on you. I haven't been able to stop listening to it since I saw it. I was in jaw- dropping awe in the theater watching that number. It's because Meryl Streep doesn't just sing a song (she has a beautiful voice and can surprisingly belt very well), she acts it. She feels each word and doesn't waste them. She's able to find the subtext in every song, every line of dialogue, every lyric. She will definitely be a presence this awards season and rightfully so.Speaking of showstoppers, I must mention the funniest duet in any musical from any time, Agony. Sung by Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen, who play Cinderella and Rapunzel's princes respectively, the number is beautifully staged and timed hilariously. Everyone in my theater roared with laughter and I was apart of it. That may actually be the best musical number in the whole movie. I'd also like to point out James Corden, who really surprised me. I knew he'd do the comedic portrayal of The Baker well, but it is the dramatic parts that had me apprehensive. He killed them. His chemistry with Emily Blunt is very believable. They work well together and they both have fantastic voices as well.I think Blunt is one of the most underrated actresses today and I'm confident this film will put her on the map. She is a grand talent. The million dollar question fans of the musical may have, ""Does she live up to Johanna Gleeson?"" My answer is, I don't know. They approach The Baker's Wife differently. Their choices completely differ and therefore they cannot be compared. The last standout I want to mention is young Lilla Crawford, who some may know as Annie in the 2012 Broadway revival. She has impeccable timing and a great voice. It is a great feature film debut for the young star.The ensemble overall is fantastic and work extremely well together. Of course the costume and production design are top notch, but I don't think anyone expected anything less. Rob Marshall and company have made the best American movie musical in over ten years. Ironically enough, Rob Marshall's Into the Woods is the best musical since Rob Marshall's Chicago. I give it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18.Reviewed by Willie J. KIDS FIRST!

74,mike48128,Once Upon a Time with Repetitive Music by Stephen Sondheim,6,8 June 2016,"It's depressing and dark. Most of the action takes place in the murky woods and it is definitely not for young children. A great cast with Meryl Streep as the multi-purpose wickedest witch ever! Very cleverly links several familiar Grimm's Fairy tales together: Jack and the Beanstalk, Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Rapunzel and just a bit of Rumpelstiltskin. A baker and his wife go on a scavenger hunt. They must collect the following for the witch: Jack's cow, the red hood, Cinderella's yellow slipper, Rapunzel's hair and/or yellow corn, and treasures from the giant. All this and the witch will grant them a child. Johnny Depp steals the spotlight as the Big Bad Wolf. Mrs. Giant goes on a rampage to recover her lost coins, golden eggs, and harp. There are no beautiful interiors of the King's Palace or the Royal Ball, only exteriors. It's mostly ""happening"" in the woods. People die, the Prince breaks his vows and the baker's wife falls off a cliff. In the end, the remaining characters are left in the woods and the baby boy has no mother. You have heard the few remarkable songs. Most of them kind of blend together like the never-ending drone of a narrative. As it fades out, ""Children Will Listen"" is a haunting song indeed. So are: ""Into the Woods"" (main theme), ""No One is Alone"", and ""Last Midnight"". Emily Blunt gives a rousing performance as well. The most dreary turn of events is what happens to the Evil Stepsisters: Each one loses either a toe or part of a heel in a fruitless attempt to fit into Cinderella's shoe and then they are blinded by the birds. Not a joyous musical!",Into the Woods
75,Sergeant_Tibbs,Neutered grating adaptation.,4,9 January 2015,"This is only the third film of his I've seen but I can't think of a toe Rob Marshall has put in the right place. The film's I've seen are lifeless and incoherent. I'm sure Into The Woods is a great witty play. There is no spark in Disney's Into The Woods. It's far too compromised and utterly neutered of commentary. While there's hints of the rape and AIDs parables that the original apparently has, here it lies uncomfortable and confused. The film is dark in its aesthetics, but it lacks any coherent texture. The biggest problem is that the film is so damn irritating. The Red Riding hood character is intolerable. It's bloated with its characters, yet sticks with the obvious plot holes and logic leaps of the fairy tales without a smirk. There's vague attempts of humour, but they hit no buttons. It just drags on and on with a terribly indistinct set of songs. To its credit, Streep deserves the hype and acclaim, Blunt is good but underused and Corden may be in over his head but he has his moments. What did Disney want to do with this? Into The Woods is a grating chore. Please stop hiring Rob Marshall, he may have vision but he has little sense.4/10",Into the Woods

The songs by Stephen Sondheim are all quite good though none of them stands out as particularly memorable.

81,PartialMovieViewer,Into the Weird and Stupid,1,18 January 2015,"Toss me the grapefruit spoon I need to scoop out my eyeballs. I just finished suffering through, ""Into the Woods"" and was I ever so happy to leave a theater. What were the studios thinking? Other than draining the wallets of unsuspecting movie-goers, what was the reason for such butchery of classic tales? And where did the reviewer high-marks come from? I noticed that the first page of 'positive' reviews was solely populated by movie goers who ONLY reviewed this title....hmmmm. Maybe some studio hired hacks? Anyhow, the list of 'dislikes' in this movie is huge, but I did enjoy a couple of moments. I will go ahead and mention all of them – don't worry, It won't take too long. Let's see, I enjoyed the Billy Magnussen and Chris Pine's little ditty on the waterfall; a very funny skit, but far from being good enough to save the rest of the film. That reminds me Pine has to get hot on a couple more, ""Star Trek,"" flicks. And please, try to avoid toilet water like this dribble. I liked Johnny Depp. He is always fun I just wish there were scripts out there that complemented his talents. Instead, most recent productions that have Mr. Depp as a cast member tend to depend more on his box-office draw. Normally, I am not a big fan of Meryl Streep, so when I say she was a bright and shining star in this production you know I am way out on a limb. I jesthahahaha (out loud)Ms. Streep was brilliant. I must admit, I enjoy her most when she avoids using that stupid exhaustive gasp in order to reiterate her frustration. Anyways, she kept to form and expertly played her role, even if it was a pointless part. So what was bad about this star-studded extravaganza any ways? I am so glad I asked. First, the script suffered in storyline, dialog and plot. Did I mention it was choppy as well? If I did not, let me addit was really choppy. I mean it was oh so choppy. Very, very choppy. Oddly, as bad as the choppiness was, it may have rescued suffering audiences from additional pain and misery. Every time a main character died, there was no prolonged attempt to appeal for tears just a 'pffffft' and they were out-a-there. Sometimes choppy is good and needed. Oh, and this was supposed to be a musical? Since when do musicals depend on tunes intended to be forgettable. Every song sounded the same, the all seemed to share a simple transition of notes supported by a bunch of disjointed words. It was like the songwriters were asking one another""OK – rock sounds like block which sounds like knock which sounds like chalk which sounds like walk.etcthink we can make a song out of that?"" Well – duh – I just made one. I am so sorry I spent money on this. This, ""Into the Woods"" was so bad I would not have gone if they paid me.",Into the Woods
82,gkeith_1,Got better as it went on.,8,9 March 2015,"I am giving this a higher mark than have many other reviewers. I was bored at first, and thought that this weird movie was so slow moving. The story lines began to pick up, so instead of leaving I decided to stay and watch the rest of it.I do love musicals, and hope that more movie musicals will again be made. I am from old school, and you readers all know that musicals are my favorite movies, especially singing and dancing.IMO Johnny Depp was incredibly awesome. He can play these oddball parts to the max. That in this short ""cameo"" appearance he appeared lecherous, greedy and very hungry I felt was just camp to the nth degree. The makeup was ingenious, and the tail was totally hilarious. The hairy clawed hands/paws were a total knockout. His hungry wolf made me think of his performance in Sweeney Todd. He was also very talented in Edward Scissorhands.Loved the blue hair. Streep knocked her witch character out of the park. Her late in the movie younger self blue hair was stunning, and even the blue witch hair was outrageously obnoxiously fitting to the part she played.The gold shoes were a different take for Cinderella. Were they made by Ferragamo? The two princes were a different take. That was a surprise.The baby was darling. The stepmother and ugly stepsisters were total riots. The baker couple were endearing and nice. Jack of the famed Beanstock did a great job, although many of his British accented song lyrics escaped my comprehension. Jack, you need to simplify your singing for American audiences.Deaths of the cow, Mrs. Baker plus Giant Woman were out of place and not for child viewers, much less adults. These depictions were disgusting, in my opinion.Jack's ""house"" was hilarious. Here, the mother said the cow could stay because it was better than the barn? The house was worse than any falling down shack, and it was certainly air conditioned. The cow was supposed to be warmer there, to give milk, according to Jack?I thought that the large gold egg was beautiful, and that the giant gold coins were stunning.

83,RforFilm,"Into the Woods is a wonderful spell of magic music, plentiful actors, and mystic atmosphere",9,28 December 2014,"Fairy tales are timeless. Their characters are timeless, their morals are timeless, and more importantly, their entertainment value is timeless. These stories have been around for hundreds of year, being told by an adult to a child about how ones wish can come true. I got my fix from the story books I received for Christmas and through Disney movies. As a writer, I continue to be inspired and encouraged by their odd characters and simple a bizarre tale can be. These stories are still popular because they are simple and is something that a lot of fantasy writers for children miss. Telling these fairy tales in a different way is also nothing new. Shrek took it to satire levels and Snow White and the Huntsman gave it a darker spin. You could even argue that Disney's way of telling Cinderella and Rapunzel is significantly different from the original source material. Once such musical that takes in several fairy tales is Into the Woods. Famed musical composer Stephen Sondheim crafted this fantasy onto the Broadway stage back in 1987 and won the heart of critics and audiences alike, now becoming a popular community theater show. Into the Woods now gets its turn for the stage to film adaptation. Right at the start, the introduction song gives us our main characters and their dilemmas; a Baker (played by James Corden) and his wife (played by Emily Blunt) want a child, but seem to have a lot of trouble conceiving. Little Red Riding Hood simply wants to visit her grandma without running into strangers. A young Jack is being forced to sell his white cow by his mother (played by Tracey Ullman) for gold. And finally, Cinderella (played by Anna Kendrick) wants to go to the three day festival and meet the prince.The Baker and his wife are visited by their next door neighbor, a Witch (played by Meryl Streep) who tells them that she can remove that curse that's preventing the couple from having a baby. All they have to do is collect a white cow, a red cape, yellow hair and a red cape. All of these things are in the woods as the witch says before disappearing. The baker and his wife depart for the dark forest and meet up with the other characters as they solve their own problems and consider that maybe ""happily ever after"" is not the end. Earlier this year, I've talk about already knowing plenty about Jersey Boys and Annie. Into the Woods is a show that I'm not familiar with, though now I'm curious to see what the production is like on stage. Into the Woods may seem like a done-to-death idea, but director Rob Marshal (same man behind Chicago) has creating something that had to be seen around the holidays; a fun spectacle that will be of constant rewatching for years to come. This ranks up there with Wizard of Oz and Hook for taking such a fantasy and giving it a very awesome atmosphere. This is a movie where everyone is casted correctly. Everyone is a great singer, great comic and well fits their fairy tale part (I didn't even mention Johnny Depp as the wolf or Chris Pine as the prince). Like in her other roles, Meryl Streep steels all her scenes as the witch. The given instructions create for an easy story for our heroes; it's just the final act I only have an issue with. While not a bad climax, it just takes a little long. Maybe a song or ten minutes could have been cut, but that's just a small complaint.I'll give this nine sets of fairy tale woods out of ten. Into the Woods is definitely too scary for children under eight, but those children above and beyond (adults mostly) should be filled musical magic and a spell of enjoyment.",Into the Woods

86,Danusha_Goska,Bring Tick Repellent,1,21 January 2015,"""Into the Woods"" is one of the worst A-list-star, major-studio movies I have ever seen. It lacks magic. It's boring and it is so inept it's actually offensive. Performances by international stars like Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Johnny Depp go kerplunk on the screen, without motivation or artistry. The cinematography is murky and flat, as if provided by Moe's Sporting Goods and Cinematography-To-Go. The problem of ""Into the Woods"" can be summed up in one word: ""meta."" ""Into the Woods"" is an attempt to *tell* fairy tales while simultaneously making meta commentary *about* fairy tales. The film fails on both points. Imagine someone telling you an anecdote about what happened with their day, and stopping after every line to say, ""At this point, you should be feeling empathy because I have just told you a sad thing. At this point, you should be feeling exhilaration, because I have just told you a celebratory thing. At this point, you should be concluding that Obama's economic policies have failed, because I have just told you that I do not have enough money for lunch. At this point, you should be feeling frustrated, because I have just defied your expectations of how this story should end."" Think of how rapidly that storytelling style would grate on you. ""Into the Woods""'s plot is a regurgitated slop, with several fairy tales mined for their money shots and slapped together in order to make some arcane point about how fairy tales are really psychologically and socially complex documents, full of implications about sexuality, gender roles, parent-child relations, and economic inequity. There's no narrative drive, no need to see what will happen next. The plot elements were just thrown in the air and allowed to fall to the ground in a random fashion. There is no main character to root for. There's no goal to be achieved and celebrate or mourn for. None of the actors can register a breath of conviction because there's nothing happening that anyone could care about. When the movie feels over, it suddenly lurches on for twenty more minutes. The music and songs do not deserve to be called either ""music"" or ""songs."" Is Stephen Sondheim the first fully deaf man ever to make a career as a composer and lyricist? Does he compose his music and lyrics by throwing darts at a piano and a thesaurus? I saw Rodgers and Hammerstein's magical ""Cinderella"" when I was around five years old. I have not seen it since. I can still sing some of the songs, they touched me that deeply, especially ""In my own little corner,"" which captures the heart and soul of every little girl who ever felt alone and escaped on dreams to a better world. I couldn't begin to recapitulate a single one of the songs from ""Into the Woods"" and I saw it just a few days ago, except for the line ""Children will listen."" All I remember is: ""Children will listen blah blah blah."" Actually, since it's Stephen Sondheim, it's more like ""Chil' dren will LISten blah blah BLIIIH."" With the ""BLIIIH"" on a minor key. There's a scene where two dueling handsome princes sing a competitive song: I'm more handsome than you; I am suffering more than you are suffering romantically. It's a great concept accompanied by a lousy song and even worse execution. Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen, both talented stars, are directed to move without grace or charm, and they do all this in leather clothing in a waterfall. The entire time you are thinking, ""Wow, that water is really gonna ruin that leather."" Fairy tales are magic. Fairy tales do make important points about gender roles, socioeconomic inequities, and parent-child-relations. Fairy tales are deep. If you want to immerse yourself in those points, read scholars like Bruno Bettleheim, Alan Dundes and Bengt Holbek. Ripping the innards out of a fairy tale and tossing those innards about randomly kills the tale. All you get is inert fairy tale innards. ""Into the Woods"" isn't sophisticated or intelligent, as it desperately wants to be. It isn't saying big, thoughtful things about fairy tales. It's just a big, meandering, amateurish misfire created by people who really aren't as sophisticated as they think they are.",Into the Woods
87,MihaiSorinToma,A very very bad story,4,23 July 2017,"In a fantastical and magical world, a couple of classic fairy tales collide in an live action attempt to create something unique. Rapunzel's mother wants her beauty back so she tasks a baker to bring her what she needs in exchange for removing his family's curse. In the meantime, Cinderella, Red Riding Hood and Jack (the one with the bean stalk) have plans of their own in relation with the main story.It's a movie which tried to create something interesting but ended up with a huge pile of rubbish. It tried to be a comedy and a musical but failed miserably in both genres, laughter and musical delight being out of the question. Although it had an interesting cast, to say the least, it tried to tell a sub-mediocre story, but everything went in any direction, except the designated one. It makes you feel that you are watching a very low budget parody, with no clear purpose, which ultimately leads to a retarded finale which simply makes no sense (as the whole movie).It's bad in every possible way, its mere existence being a huge question for me, let alone why its cast accepted to play in such a misery.",Into the Woods

90,AhmedSpielberg99,"It was Nice, until...",7,30 April 2020,"Honestly, I didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I did. I think the integration of characters from multiple fairy tales is an intriguing concept, and the execution is fairly good. The fairy tales, in themselves, occasionally feel unsatisfying and pedestrian, but I found the main plot that weaves all of them together, to my surprise, interesting. The songs are ranging from ones that are truly excellent to ones that are just fine (if a bit dumb and definitely far from memorable). Every member of the star-studded cast did a decent job (especially Emily Blunt), although I found Meryl Streep's performance as The Witch a bit too silly, but I guess this has to do with the character itself. Yes, there are many unnecessary sub-plots, but I didn't mind that as much. And I actually liked the dark spin that's put on some of the fairy tales (Cinderella, as a case in point). Everything was surprisingly good (except for the plastic production design) until everything fell apart, figuratively and literally. The movie became far more awkwardly edgy and dark for its own good, as if that would made it ""subversive""... I guess. And the plot became completely incoherent at the last act, the songs became insufferably terrible and the movie overall became an utter mess, and all this due to that stupid decision. I didn't end up even liking this.(7/10)",Into the Woods

If you can imagine ""Once Upon a Time"" loaded with never-ending musical numbers you have a good idea what to expect from this impressive film. Besides a few spots where you know you're on a movie set, audiences will no doubt get lost in the land of make-believe Director Rob Marshall transports you to. In ""Into the Woods,"" a baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) are childless as the result of the curse of a once-beautiful witch (Meryl Streep).

During their journey, they meet Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) and Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), each one on a quest to fulfill a wish.The movie is rated PG for thematic elements, fantasy action and peril, and some suggestive material. There are some surprisingly adult-type situations towards the end of the movie when the mood of the film switches gears. The nods to the original Grimm's fairy tales might be a bit too disturbing for younger viewers as well.""Into the Woods"" will be a big hit with audiences into the theater and musicals. It takes an interesting turn in its third act which, if you've never seen the production before, will come as a shock to those who want to live happily ever after. I do have to say some of the sets look and feel stagey, which took me out of the viewing experience at times. The singing and performances by the entire cast were spot-on.

To me, ""Into the Woods"" was a confusing mashup of fairy tales, with random music interspersed between the tenuously linked story lines. Now for the record, I am a regular subscriber to musical theatre, so I am not a redneck genre hater. Hell, I even liked Xanadu (the movie). I love most of Sondheim's musicals, but this one got away from me almost from the start. The concept of darkening everything up did appeal to me, but I was so confused by mid film, that I stopped caring. And what was the message of the film? That cheating on your spouse is OK if you're a powerful man, but not if you're a woman. That terror is a tool to reach your end goal. The end justifies the means, so its OK to lie, steal and cheat to achieve your goal.I hope the cash that you laid out for the star power in this one gets the tax break you were looking for.

95,RossRivero99,One of Disney's very best films,9,7 January 2015,"Rob Marshall's Into the Woods is not only a wonderful movie for the entire family to watch but it is also a wonderful adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's Broadway musical of the same name, because it was just a near perfect film with all the most important things in order for musical type movies to actually be good such as choreography, music, songs, as well as the singing. The movie tells the story of a baker (played by James Corden) and his wife (played by Emily Blunt) who are asked by a witch (played by Meryl Streep) to bring four certain items from fairy tales like Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood (played by Lilia Crawford) along with the wolf (played by Johnny Depp in a performance that I have never seen him do before in any of his films), and Rapunzel with her prince and her never-ending love story with her prince (played by Billy Magnussen), in order to have a child for the first time (in which the interlocking fairy tale thing to me is the neatest thing in the movie). Though I did like the movie I did have a small problem with the film and it was the fact that one of the genres to this movie was a comedy when really I didn't find any of the scenes funny but entertaining, as well as the few predictable scenes in the movie which were the scenes in the movie where Cinderella (played by Anna Kendrick) runs away from her prince (played by Chris Pine) for which those are the only scenes that I found to be annoying OR that they are getting old and a relief is that it didn't go on for too long. The one thing that I find kind of weird about the Chris Pine performance is that every time he speaks in the movie he always sounds like he is trying to impress women 24/7. Director Rob Marshall has made one of the best fairy tales to ever be put on film, and it is a film that I think will receive Oscar consideration in the best original song category, and best makeup in which I think it will win even along with best costume design. But in the end I think it is a very well made film that however isn't flawless but it is near there, and those of you who haven't seen this movie go I would recommend that you go see it while it's still in theaters.",Into the Woods
96,billygoat1071,Broadway Bombast,7,1 February 2015,"Into the Woods is one of the most Broadway musical movies you can think of. If you are one of those who can't stand such show, then this movie is definitely not for you, not only because it's a musical, but even for a movie, its narrative and style are totally designed in stage. But for the enjoyment of the music, it's definitely worth the time. The movie is based on the famous Broadway musical, which is also based on a book, that connects every Brothers Grimm tale together and leads each of their stories into a different fate. It is one clever interpretation, and in this adaptation, it's externally faithful, as it manages to make it look like it's still on stage, but with grander visuals. There are a couple of flaws, but there's no denying how fun the show still is.This version manages to work, in spite that some darker parts and songs from the original musical were omitted. The movie just never lacks energy in every scene, it has a total musical bombast, completely following the rules of a musical play, which also brings a somewhat uneven approach as a movie. In cinematic form, it makes the storytelling feel a little rushed, the only parts where it is able to breathe are in the musical scenes. While that's what everybody came in for, it still feels like there are certain points that needed to be developed. But it's still easy to understand how the stories come together and the message beneath it, thus remains a compelling experience.Even the filmmaking stays with the same visual limitations, as the musical scenes focuses on how the actors perform rather than extending the scale or choreography. The camera just pans from one performer to another, as they sing off the plot. That's the whole style here, apparently. Thankfully, the actors are full of enthusiasm, with Meryl Streep delightfully shines as the Witch, and Emily Blunt and James Corden live up as the heart of the picture. Anna Kendrick and Chris Pine also bring lively performances in their small roles. And Johnny Depp does what everyone would expect him to do, and he also wears a fancy hat. The rest of the achievement basically just added the aesthetics with CGI, which looks pretty enough for the grimy woods and other sparkling effects. And yet, the camera wants to pretend that it couldn't shoot the full size of a CG giant or explore the adventures of Jack and the ball from Cinderella. But if that's the wholehearted goal they're seeking for then it's fair enough.Into the Woods is an entertaining adaptation in the end, even if it sacrifices much from the original vision, it still brought the same joy and theme. Its attempt at keeping the scale of a musical stage can be both an interesting and odd idea. While it does make for an intriguing strategy of embracing the roots of its source material, you might as well realize that it's basically the show but with Hollywood stars and computer effects. Aside from that thought, it's still an enjoyable experience, taking us to the same realm that redefines the happily ever after of these classic fairy tales.",Into the Woods

I was totally unaware of the stage version before this but, I was still slightly interested in seeing it.The film is very well made and its story is pretty sweet, dramatic, and amusing. The songs are beautiful and awesomely performed, the sets and costumes look great and really sell the fantasy, and the cast doesn't have a single bad performer in ithowever, watching this film once was enough for me. It's good but the film ended up dragging badly for me during the second half and all the fun and enthusiasm I had when it began was drained from me when it felt like the whole film was starting all over again after what felt like the ending just arrived.That really is my only complaint about ""Into the Woods.""

98,davidgee,Actors who can't sing,5,30 January 2015,"CGI - vanishing witches, the Beanstalk, the giant (giantess) - helps to link this subversive musical to the Disneyfied Grimm Brothers' stories that it incorporates.Meryl Streep, who as we know from MAMA MIA really can sing, steals the show dramatically and musically. Chris Pine is the best of the supporting cast, ditching his action boy image to play a Prince with a (very) roving eye. In the good old days, musical-wise, it was common to cast actors who couldn't sing and dub them with singers who presumably couldn't act. Now actors who can't - or shouldn't - sing do their own singing, often with painful results. Think Piers Brosnan, think Russell Crowe. In INTO THE WOODS James Corden is the one whose singing voice is - how can I put this? - less than a joy for the listener.Sondheim's lyrics have never been less than brilliant (all the way back to WEST SIDE STORY) and they are very clever here (occasionally a bit ""clever-clogs"" clever). The tunes are not the kind of thing you walk out humming (rarely the case with today's musicals - excuse me while I have a whinge). But the structure of this revisionist fairy-tale is amusingly intricate and la Streep is (when isn't she?) on fine form. A show worth popping into on a grim - Grimm! - winter's day.",Into the Woods

I loved it immediately and managed to track down a copy which i have watched a fair few times. This version is much better than I was expecting it to be though i found it overlong by about 20 minutes. I was surprised by how good James Corden and Emily Blunt were in it and disappointed with the casting of Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, though her singing was great as was the rest of the cast. I always expect great things from Meryl Streep so was surprised to wish it had been Bernadette Peters who defined the role for me onstage. That said I warmed to her. The appalling reviews I have read on IMDb I find confusing. Either the cinema-goers of today are far below normal intelligence or have just totally missed the premise of this production. To hate the music and the way the stories intertwine is astonishing to me. The movie is not perfect but it is far better than it has been given credit for.",Into the Woods

Disney usually stands out as far as music but this music was bad. The best song was done by men (the princes and even that wasn't so great). The thing I really had a problem with was the sadness of the story. This story didn't make sense at the end with its ridiculous depressing situation that the characters were left with. And then to top it all off to kill of one of the better characters for no good reason at all except to make the ending depressing.

It was fantastic what she did with her role as the wicked which. Blown away. It was a stellar cast all together with Emily Blumt and James Corden doing wonderful things with their parts as well.

102,CinematicInceptions,"Pretty weak story, but potentially enjoyable.",5,13 September 2015,"I just want to start off by saying that I have done my utmost to keep my dislike for the musical genre out of what I say here. So yes this is coming from someone who doesn't appreciate musicals very much, but please understand that the genre has only impacted my rating- not my review. I haven't seen the play itself, but I do have some familiarity with theater from seeing a number of school plays and such. While I understand that adapting a play into a movie can be quite as difficult as a book can, I think they could have done a better job of it. In play format, some of the songs were obviously meant to express the characters' thoughts, but in a movie you can do that much more effectively with a couple of shots rather than dialogue. Things like the arc of the baker being ""different in the woods"" was probably better left unstated for the audience to conclude on their own.The story ended up being a little haphazard. It was fine to connect all of the fairy tales with the baker and his wife wanting a child. They didn't feel the need to put a twist on the fairy tales, which might be a bit of a relief to some who are sick of that plot basis. The first 80 or so minutes consist of the the baker and his wife trying to gather the items needed for the witch to reverse their curse of infertility. This is done, but you can tell that the story feels incomplete at this point and it has too much of a happily ever after feel that we've come to expect less recently even from Disney. Not ending at that point would have been fine in itself, but the final act with the female giant coming down to avenge her husband was rather a weak turn. Honestly, everything that happened after Cinderella's wedding could have worked as a sequel. The mini plot lines weren't necessarily a bad thing, but it caused for some theme confusion. There were a whole bunch of mini-themes that weren't really clear about what they were trying to get across. Some made sense like the witch being over protective of Rapunzel and Red Riding Hood learning to err on the side of caution (which made me think that the fairy tale might be an allegory for pedophiles). But others like whole thing with the baker's father wasn't cohesive.Even though Meryl Streep was nominated for her performance as a supporting actress, she has the most prominent role aside from the baker and his wife. The witch is kind of intriguing. I liked her some of her lines addressing the shallowness of the other characters. She isn't the most motivated character, though it's hinted that she has afterlife pressure from her mother. The baker's character was good for the most part, though I didn't like how his father's ghost came in at the end and convinced him to stay and raise his newborn. It didn't feel consistent with his character, and I think it would have made more sense for the baker to protect his kid as a way of sticking it to his old man for not being there. The same goes for the baker's wife, who is easy enough to root for during most of the movie, but then dies shortly after effectively cheating on her husband. It just wasn't a very satisfying way to end. Perhaps it was realistic, but it would have been cooler if she had died resisting the prince. Cinderella has a bit of an arc with wishing for the palace from her stepmother's home and then seeing the prince for what he is. Jack seems to butt heads a lot with his mother through his adventurousness and imagination. This might account for his lack of emotion after her death. Red Riding Hood gets very little screen time and isn't very vital to the plot. She seems to get adopted by the baker at the end, which is good because she can't have great parenting with a grandmother that lives in the woods and a mother that sends her there on her own. Rapunzel is hardly prominent except to enhance the witch's character by defying her over-protectiveness. The two princes make sparing appearances, most notably the satirical number ""Agony"".There were some mediocre special effects. The directing, camera-work, and lighting were average, though the whole film has essentially the same color scheme. The acting was pretty good, which entails singing talent. There is a lot of singing, and many of the songs are derivatives of the same melody. Much if not most of the dialogue is in song form, which leads to some of the adaptive issues I was going on about earlier. The climatic ""Your Fault"" song was pretty well done.As with all Disney movies, it's a good family film. It's enjoyable if you like musicals and plays, but not if you're looking for story. Contrary to what you might expect, it's not really a twist on a fairy tale like Tangled, Maleficent, Mirror Mirror, or Princess and the Frog. Nor is it an adult fairy tale movie like Snow White and the Huntsman, Grimm, or Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters. It's only two hours, but feels longer because of the ""turn"" near the end. I didn't think any aspect of it was Oscar worthy, even those with nominations. Still, we all probably know that Oscars are not indicative of quality. If you base your viewing decisions on actors, Meryl Streep, James Corden, and Emily Blunt are much more prominent than Johnny Depp or even Anna Kendrick. If you don't like fairy tale movies in general, this won't be any better than the others. If you do like them, you might be surprised either way. Overall Rating 6.4/10.",Into the Woods
103,ClaytonDavis,"Rob Marshall's highly energetic musical features top turns from Pine, Streep, Blunt, and Corden...",6,18 December 2014,"Slick, lavish, and imaginatively vibrant, Rob Marshall's newest musical adaptation ""Into the Woods"" hits most of the notes as a thoroughly entertaining experience of the holiday season. Assembling one the year's finest casts, Marshall brings his ability to bring each actor to their utmost potential, while keeping composer Stephen Sondheim's brilliance intact. In the end however, the real problem with ""Woods"" is that its narrative structure is slashed like a hairstylist that took too much off the top, or in this case the second act. The first hour of James Lapine's adaptation is so wholesomely fulfilling. When the story takes a sudden, yet awkward shift into ""serious"" and more adult territory, this Disney produced spectacle struggles to find its footing. Perhaps, a director's cut, 30 minutes longer, and more clearly obvious themes would have felt more satisfying. This doesn't take away from the marvelous performances that are abound. Those will surely keep you engaged enough to make it through.It's imperative to begin with Chris Pine. A movie star that hasn't been afforded the opportunity to stretch his acting legs beyond ""Star Trek"" and ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit."" When you look at the definition of having fun in a role, Pine's face will be planted firmly next to the words. A career best performance with the show's best musical number, ""Agony."" Try to look at him the same way after this. A true standout, and scene stealer. Go figure by the way, the man has a very impressive set of pipes.The Queen of the Academy, three-time Oscar-winner Meryl Streep is the best she's been since ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Seeing Streep operate in these later years, especially stage adaptations like ""Doubt,"" ""Mamma Mia!,"" and last year's ""August: Osage County,"" have not brought out the greatness that Streep is capable of achieving. Granted, anything that is ""lower-tier Meryl"" is probably better than most, but I've ached to see her hit another home run. This is it. Streep's work as the Witch is profoundly moving and beautifully orchestrated. ""Stay with Me"" and especially ""Last Midnight"" will reaffirm her place in our cinematic lives. One of the best performances of the year.The gorgeous and vivacious Emily Blunt is everything you've come to expect from her at this point in her career. She's an amazing performer, beautiful singer, and knows how to elevate material, even when it clearly begins to bog her down. There's nothing wrong with the way that Blunt interprets the Baker's Wife. She's desperate, eager, and extremely hyperactive to get what she wants. In the latter part of the script, a controversial choice could have ignited talk and tears however, because there's clearly chops throughout the narrative, the Baker's Wife's role ultimately feels non-fulfilling for the audience. That doesn't take away from Blunt's talents. She's simply terrific.In what clearly is designed to be the heart and soul of ""Into the Woods,"" James Corden's work as the Baker will propel him into a household name (especially with his upcoming takeover for Craig Ferguson). He's funny, tender, and just a joy to watch. He's a throwback to John C. Reilly's Oscar-nominated work in ""Chicago."" Affecting, expressive, and memorable. In a story full of characters you grew up loving, making terrible life choices, you find yourself rooting for someone to come on the other side alive, intact, and sustained. For many, Corden will be that character. He's the real deal. I can't wait to see him in more challenging and daring roles in the future.""Up in the Air"" gave us Anna Kendrick, well at least to the high- brow film community. One Academy Award nomination later, she has mostly succeeded in her own vehicles like ""Pitch Perfect"" and the upcoming ""The Last 5 Years,"" at least based on early word. Playing Cinderella is a daunting task. Anyone who has it will have to compete with mental images from the animated classic, and any other live action interpretation you've seen throughout your life. Kendrick has the physical prowess and charisma to do all Cinderella's assets justice however, there's something that ultimately feels off. While her co- star Pine disappears into the role of the Prince with no semblance of his former character interpretations, Kendrick just doesn't disguise herself enough to warrant a 100% golden star, or in this case a shoe. For her number ""On the Steps of the Palace,"" she nearly hits her stride. Just not exactly what we hoped for.The rest of the cast has their individual moments. Johnny Depp's interpretation of the Wolf was fun, but anyone who had a problem with his vocal range in ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"" will have their lickings once again. I'm glad that I've learned who Billy Magnussen is now as a result of his work as Rapunzel's Prince. He's delightful. Mackenzie Mauzy's Rapunzel is an unrealized staple of the musical that could have been far more richer and satisfying than what was ultimately displayed. Mauzy's turn is essential.Christine Baranski's work as the wicked Stepmother kicks off the film on the most enormous high. A delectable presence sprinkled throughout. Same for the brilliant Tracey Ullman who just needs to be in more movies these days. The young performers, Daniel Huttlestone as Jack and Lilla Crawford as Red Riding Hood are equal parts impressive and annoying. The step-sisters, Lucy Punch and Tammy Blanchard are finely tuned with their wicked counterpart throughout.""Into the Woods"" is an energetic, rapturous romp at the movies. Lovely displayed with stunning production work and costume design, which are both singular standouts of the film year. Managed, genuine, and appreciated, ""Into the Woods"" is a must-watch for the season. An alluring, though flawed work, that stands as an excuse and reason to keep the movie musical alive. If anything, above all else, you take that with you to the bank.Read more @ (www.awardscircuit.com)",Into the Woods
104,MattBrady099,Music lovers this is for you,5,11 January 2015,"Well you're not the only one who thought that this was going to be the next Les miserables just by judging on the trailers and early Oscar buzz.The story is about a baker and his wife, looking to life a curse, visit the woods and the witch who lives there: she spins a tale involving many beloved fairy tale characters, including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk and Rapunzel. I remember very well back in November 2013, that this movie that wasn't coming until like a year and it was already getting so much Oscar Buzz and it's really crazy when you think about. People where already predicting the categories for the movie even when their haven't even seen it yet. Everybody wouldn't shut up about this movie and when the reviews came out for this movie it was a bit mix for some but still good through, but not has good as people thought it was going to be.Into the Woods for me was a okay movie. This isn't in anywhere near has good as Les Miserables. But the movie was way over hyped by a lot of people and this is what happens when you over hype things, it will lead to disappointment.This movie has a pretty big cast and some of them do really good and I have to say that all the actors in this movie sing really well. Nobody did a crap job of singing. Nobody did the Russell Crowe of singing, no they all do fantastic singing.Meryl Streep to me stole the show. That was just something about her character in this movie that just stood out to me and I just loved her body moment and the tone on her voice that was just spot on with her character. I may have made jokes about Mery being a Oscar magnet, but she really is a flawless actress that I always knocks my socks off every time I seen her.For problems and I have a lot: Johnny Depp is in this movie and you probably think his just playing a goofy and weirdo that Depp always is, but no in this movie he comes off a bit creepy and really unsettling or and Depp pretty much plays Depp and nothing special. I know this is base on a popular on the Broadway show but I can't help to say that the sets in this movie looks like it's a Broadway play more then a full feature film. The movie is way too long, because I thought the film was rapping up on a good note but the film kept going and going and good god it went on for every.Overall Into the Woods is for people who love musicals or Broadway. But for me movies like this isn't my kind of thing but I always watch them to see if it dose surprise me or not, and this movie is just okay.",Into the Woods
105,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Hollywood finally gets a musical right (or close, rather...)",7,11 January 2015,"So often adaptations of musicals to the silver screen are vastly inferior to the original, not so with Disney's Into the Woods.Into the Woods intertwines several well known characters and stories from the Grimm's fairy tales with the original tale of a childless baker and his wife.Within Into the Woods are notable characters from Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, and Jack and the Beanstalk. As with any fairy tale there is an ""evil"" witch who ""manipulates"" desperate innocents to do her bidding. In this case it is a baker and his wife whose lives are cursed, unbeknownst to them, that is preventing them from having a child. So, to reverse the curse they must seek out the items the witch needs to make a potion: cow as white as milk, cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, slipper as pure as gold before the chime of midnight in three days time. All main characters venture off into the woods and it is there that their stories converge.Disney smartly decides to have the Tony award winning stage playwright and creator of Into the Woods, James Lapine, to write the screenplay for the film. This decision certainly contributes significantly to the successfulness of the movie as a musical adaptation. The music and lyrics of Stephen Sondheim remain intact and are pivotal to the plot progression, seamlessly blending and transitioning within the tale.Note: this film is an adaptation of a Broadway Musical so the movie will be rife with singing. You may be thinking, ""But silly Archon Cinema Reviews! It's a musicalof course it will feature song and dance!"" Apparently I have acquaintances that were unaware of this fact and their only complaint for Into the Woods was: too. much. music. (insert facepalm here) In terms of instrumental moments representing a percentage of the film, Into the Woods is on the upper tier of the spectrum.As with the musical it is during the second act that Into the Woods departs substantially from the known plots of the aforementioned fairy tales. Into the Woods allows itself to take a darker and more sinister tone as with the original Grimm stories. It seems as though something gets lost in translation from the stage to the silver screen. With Disney at the helm, some of the truly wicked plot points get moved off screen and are barely implied so the plot gets muddled toward the end.Overall, Into the Woods is one of the more successful musical adaptations. Disney chooses to get actors and actresses that are well known and have vocal capability. Further, director Rob Marshall captures the same fantasy of the production with minimal CGI, enhancing the imaginative experience.Please check out our website for more full reviews of all the recent releases.",Into the Woods
106,bbewnylorac,Way over-rated,4,19 January 2015,"While the cast of this glossy musical is stunning -- Meryl Streep, Christine Baranski, Emily Blunt, Johnny Depp, Anna Kendrick -- it doesn't add up to a good movie. Firstly, none of the songs are memorable at all. It's more a sung play than a true musical, but you don't leave the cinema humming a tune. The best musicals have classic songs that become standards. Secondly, melding lots of fairy tales together is a cute idea, but not enough effort has been put into it. The plot is patchy, as though made up as it goes along. Thirdly, there is not enough humour, which is a crying shame, particularly when actors like Streep and Blunt are wicked comic actors. Fourthly, many scenes play out stiffly, like it's still a stage play, such as the scene of Cinderella singing on the castle steps, and the two princes singing at the waterfall. On the plus side, James Corden is luminous as an unlikely leading man, the baker. He's very likable and a fine singer and actor. The two children - who play Jack of the Beanstalk fame and Little Red Riding Hood - are excellent, both mischievous and bright, although one has a thick cockney accent and one a broad American accent. Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt in the two female leads are both great in their screen presence and singing. Some of the locations such as Jack's farm and Cinderella's prince's castle, are lovely, but a lot of the woods backdrops are too dark and monotonous and more imagination could have been used.",Into the Woods
107,estreet-eva,Entertaining if a little overlong,6,21 January 2015,"Stephen Soundheim's genius for songwriting gets a workout from a cast of Hollywood heavies including its heaviest - Meryl Streep. Academy-favorite Streep brings her sturdy voice to the main role of the witch and chews the scenery as required by the part but in an understated way befitting a Harvard grad. Would Indina Menzel been more fun, perhaps, and the witches transformation into a young beauty would been more convincing. On the opposite side of the fairy tale good/evil divide is the enchanting Anna Kendrik as Cinderella. While she's not particularly outstanding in the role, she's worth watching in pretty much anything. New talk show host James Corden plays the main role as The Baker and does most of the heavy lifting to keep things moving along. He isn't quite a compelling screen presence but playing opposite Emily Blunt he doesn't get outshined. Jonny Depp spends five minutes playing The Big Bad Wolf and does his best to outshine the rest of the cast but this isn't his most memorable character. Rounding out the interesting cast is Star Trek's Chris Pine who physically embodies Prince Charming as much as he does James T. Kirk. If you don't come for the cast, the music, particularly the songwriting is well worth the time. And be prepared to spend considerable time as the movie plays out another hour or so after a false ending which would have left you satisfied with the experience. Like ""There Will be Blood"" or ""Contact"", sometimes the editor needs to understand the third act after the false ending can be an unwelcome gift. Sometimes enough is enough. In short, somewhat overlong but clever casting and the Soundheim score, although it works better live in the theater, plays well on the screen.",Into the Woods

109,Marc_Israel_365,Once the fables are over the story continues...,7,28 December 2014,"Rob Marshall takes the Broadway hit to the awaiting masses. To his credit, the storyline remains quite accessible and his direction clever is enough, but with this genre, the acting is always a bit imprisoned by the signing dialog. another notch down due to being musically non- memorable apart from the opening tune and some lines in a few others. The song ""Agony"" is a clear exception and was one of the times that a double entredre allowed some depth. Into The Woods is visually compelling and there are a lot of ""after the moral has ended"" messages tightly packed in to the lyrics, but not so neatly as to thankfully keep it from being labeled envelope pushing Hollywood drech. I'd watch it again but not in the theater.",Into the Woods
110,markgorman,"If you're a purist you won't like this. If not, it's great fun.",7,10 January 2015,"I must admit I approached this having only just survived Les Miserables a couple of years ago. As a result I feared the worst - not helped by the fact that the critics had not exactly been swooning over it. But these are film critics with a healthy disdain for other forms of entertainment such as theatre, and most especially musical theatre. The Sondheim purists have also had the knives out, but, hey, that's like being harangued by a group of trainspotters.The best advice I can give is; if you don't like musical theatre stay well away. And if you're a Musical Theatre purist you may have a few hackles up. All I can say to you is ""get over it.""If, like me, you love great musical theatre and great performances (on the whole) this will fill your heart with joy.It's no ordinary Disney movie either - a bit more adult themed and certainly no vacuous Little Mermaid fodder - but, nevertheless, it's glorious entertainment from start to finish. (That said, the younger children in the audience became a bit restless.)The two most obvious comparisons are Sondheim's Sweeney Todd, starring Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. That's a fine film, albeit neither Depp nor HBC are real singers.The other is the aforementioned, ludicrously awful, Les Miserables. That film should have been put behind bars and the keys thrown away for crimes against music.On both fronts Into The Woods walks away with all the prizes. It's a glorious romp, pulling together the stories of Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel and Little Red Riding Hood into a completely new construct that pulls together the threads of what stands for goodness and badness in the land of fairy tale. Wrapping it all together is the quest that a Baker (James Cordon; solid) and his wife (Emily Blunt; outstanding) go on at the behest of their neighbour, a witch, played show-stealingly by Meryl Streep. Depp's cameo as the Wolf is passable.The story cracks along at a furious pace for around an hour but slows somewhat in Act 2, nevertheless it's an engaging and heartwarming tale underpinned by Sondheim's astonishing score and hilarious and very clever lyrics. It's given great respect and delivered extremely well throughout by a great ensemble cast.Another show stealer is the Princes' performance of 'Agony' that's hilariously OTT, as it should be. And Frances De La Tour as the Giant's wife raises many a chuckle.It's not absolutely true to the stage play (Disney sensitivities has softened some of its more adult themes) but Sondheim was engaged to write around this and the result does not spoil the story - although purists will argue this point.In all, it's not as challenging as the stage production and it seems to be undecided as to who its audience is - it's quite surprising that Disney bought the rites given the above. That said it's a hugely enjoying distraction and two hours of wonderful escapism.",Into the Woods
111,Okonh0wp,memorable with a flawed second half,7,23 January 2015,"Perhaps, because of the dearth of grandiose musicals (Jay Carney's output is disqualified here), ""Into the Woods"" is one of the films I most remember despite some problematic elements in the second half.The film is adapted from a Stephen Sondheim play that doesn't outright parody memorable fairy tales like Jack and the Beanstalk or Repunzel in a ha ha sense, but rather a critical eye and a dark, Gothic tone. The film combines the Jack and the Beanstalk, Repunzel, Cinderella, and Little Red Hiding Stories hearkening back to the original source material where, for example, Cinderella's two step-sisters mutilate their feet in order to be able to fool the prince into thinking they're his soul mate. Adapting Sondheim's play presents some very strong challenges in terms of where to intermingle the humor, the Gothic angles, and most importantly, balancing the tone as the film progresses from its first to second half.The first half of the play is relatively bright and sunny in comparison to a second half where death and destruction occur in this same universe. As a result, maintaining any semblance of tone becomes a ridiculously difficult balancing act so I don't fault Rob Marshall (who has gotten a lot of flack for being a clunky director) for failing to pull it off entirely. In my opinion, the first half needed a little more darkness (and maybe just a couple more jokes) while the second half needed either a greater touch of whimsiness at the appropriate moments or a full-on tonal shift that matches the darker turn of events. The film's production values are also quite strong despite reports of the contrary. The film certainly feels and smells of the forest. The film boasts a memorable cast and has a great ensemble that includes Meryl Streep, Anna Kendrick, Emily Blunt, James Corden (who could have used his 2014 performances to launch a great film career if he hadn't already signed a deal to take over a TV show), Chris Pine and Daniel Hiddlestone, and it's certainly a true ensemble",Into the Woods
112,jawneyfloros,the brothers grimm,10,19 November 2018,Review: I found this to be an interesting movie because it brings several of the brother's Grimm classics and combines them to make this multi-tiered fantasy musical.

113,doug_park2001,"""Witches can be right--giants can be good""",6,12 March 2015,"INTO the WOODS cleverly intermeshes several well-known fairy tales, adding some nice flourishes: A brash and gutsy Red Riding Hood, a cockney-speaking Jack of the Beanstalk, and a handsome, charming, yet philandering prince. Those who generally like this sort of thing will probably find IW worth seeing. There's also plenty of meaning if that's what you're after. A few other noteworthy lines: ""Are you certain that your wish is what you want?""; ""You're not good, you're not bad, you're just nice""; ""Even flowers have their dangers""; and finally,""'I shall always love the girl who ran away'—'And I, the faraway prince.'"" Nice performances by just about everyone, but especially Meryl Streep as the Witch, Lilla Crawford as Red Riding Hood, Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, and David Huttlestone as Jack. The biggest problem is that IW may prove too draggy—it would have benefited from being 15-20 minutes shorter--and complicated for many younger audiences, too tame and sappy for many older ones. This film takes place in a kingdom whose citizens sing about 75% of what they say to the same old loud-rhyming riff, making it distractingly seem like a parody of a bad stage musical; the script is so much better in the remaining 25% where they speak in normal fashion. Although IW is truly funny in a few places, it tries just a bit too hard in that area, and the humor is often forced. Some nice visuals, but it's not up to Disney's usual standards. The creators of this film had a difficult and ambitious project on their hands; regardless, IW lacks both the cohesive plot and the emotional impact of something like MALEFICENT.Oh, well. If you find the rest of the film at least watchable, you will probably find the very, very end well-worth getting to. I also have to admire the way this film addresses the mortality of its characters.",Into the Woods

115,mnpollio,Barely improved film of a mediocre stage musical,5,21 February 2015,"Stephen Sondheim fans are to the theater what Martin Scorsese fans are to the screen. If Sondheim left a steaming pile on the stage, his rabid fan base would invent new words to describe its brilliance and defy anyone to disagree. Into the Woods debuted on Broadway in 1987 to much fanfare, but ended up losing the Tony for Best Musical to The Phantom of the Opera, which caused numerous Sondheim fan's heads to explode since they regard pretty much everyone, but especially Andrew Lloyd Webber, as an inferior songwriter. For better or worse, POTO has played ever since that day, while Into the Woods had a successful initial run and then a failed revival.On paper, Into the Woods sounds great. Take some of the most famous fairy tale characters and throw them together and then in Act II have all hell break lose for some definitely fractured fairy tales. The problem is that Act I, which is supposed to adhere fairly closely to the fairy tales is surprisingly uneven and charmless, and Act II has moments that are too childish for adults and moments too adult for children, leaving the impression of a tonally uneven musical that should be sparkling but is amazingly drab.Any changes director Rob Marshall could make to the source material would probably be improvements (and the few he does make actually are), but he makes the mistake of largely being too faithful to the source which results in a drab, tonally uneven film similar to the stage show. Some of the comic flourishes which are retained were never very funny to begin with (i.e., is it really that funny to see Jack repeatedly being beaten by his mother for stupidity?).The cast all sing very well, but the performances are predictably across the charts. I am uncertain that re-casting Jack and Little Red Riding Hood from young adults to actual children was all that wise, but David Huddlestone and Lilla Crawford do their best - although Crawford is admittedly so obnoxious that you actually root for the Wolf to eat her. Emily Blunt and James Corden are the focal point of the story as the Baker and His Wife, who are forced to venture into the woods to find items to reverse a curse of barrenness placed on them by The Witch. Both have nice voices, but their characters are not particularly likable which puts restraint on how much we want them to succeed. Tracy Ullmann is thoroughly detestable as Jack's mother. Anna Kendrick is in lovely voice, but her Cinderella is often so bland, whiny and wishy-washy that you wonder what the Prince sees in her. At the other end of the spectrum, Johnny Depp makes a memorable cameo as a zoot-suited Wolf whose sexual overtones in his one song to Crawford come slithering through. Billy Magnussen and Chris Pine both elevate previously forgettable roles to new heights. While Meryl Streep turns in the kind of scene-stealing performance one can always count on as The Witch. Unfortunately, it is a distinctly supporting role, but the film does switch into high gear whenever she is on screen.As for the music, there are some good tunes and a lot of crummy ones. Streep gets the best numbers with ""Stay With Me,"" ""Children Will Listen,"" and really slams home her finale of ""The Last Midnight."" ""No One is Alone"" is also a touching number. By contrast, the title song, which introduces the characters, is near unendurable. Songs like ""A Very Nice Prince"" and ""Your Fault"" are at best forgettable. ""Agony"" only succeeds in the film because Pine and Magnussen throw themselves into it with such hammy delivery that it becomes a joy to behold disguising the fact that the song itself is nothing great. Similarly, ""It Takes Two"" is an underwhelming song, but unfortunately Blunt and Corden do not get to indulge in the overacting that may have put it over better. ""I Know Things Now"" is a complete time-waster because it is disturbingly unmelodic and Little Red Riding Hood is a character with whom no one wants to tarry. And both ""Giants in the Sky"" and ""On the Steps of the Palace"" are the kind of pointless, dreadful, boring piffle that would be massacred if anyone but Sondheim's name were attached. The former is a completely unpleasant wasted number for Jack and the latter is the faux-character exploration number for Cinderella that helps make her seem a royal pill. Yet one must admit that even the best number in the film will not inspire anyone to hum it on the way out or raise the pulse to toe-tapping levels.Although the film has mercifully changed the fate of Rapunzel and Her Prince which is a major improvement (someone needed a happy ending after all), the screenplay itself still retains the nasty streak with deaths, infidelities, eye-gougings and mutilations enough to make parents of the very young think twice. Yet one thing I have never understood is why the show/movie is so ugly to look at? Shouldn't at least the first part be filled with eye-catching splendor? Why do both the show and the film make everything look so mundane, bleak and boring right from the start? By the end of both, I found myself rather happy to leave their fairy tale land and its inhabitants and not return, which I am pretty certain was not the goal. So while I can appreciate some of the cast, a couple of the songs and the clever idea behind the basic premise, I really find the final product - on both stage and screen - sorely lacking.",Into the Woods
116,Figgy66-915-598470,A Stephen Sondheim Masterpiece,9,12 January 2015,"12 January 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Into The Woods. Based on a stage show of the same name with music and lyrics by the marvellous Stephen Sondheim, this film is the glorious coming together of a selection of Grimms Fairy Tales. Starring the wonderfully versatile Meryl Streep as the witch, this is the tale of a childless baker and his wife (James Cordon and Emily Blunt) who are sent on a quest by the witch to gather five items which will enable her to reverse the curse that has made them unable to have a family. Combining the tales of Cinderella, Jack and The Beanstalk, Rapunzel, and Little Red Riding Hood, this is an eclectic gathering of characters who tell the story through song. Very cleverly written lyrics and interesting harmonies provide, at time extremely humorous scenes. Look out for the two princes, in a waterfall, bemoaning their lack of luck with the ladies, I had tears falling down my face. Johnny Depp makes an appearance as a wolf and as per his greatness in roles of this kind was totally at ease with his ears and his whiskers and brought a real surreal spooky air to the character. It may seem that there are many words and that you would never remember the songs, but how many of you remembered more than Let It Go the first time you saw Frozen. I for one, am going to buy the soundtrack to this.",Into the Woods
117,kermitkid,Go Into the Woods!,9,30 March 2020,"I don't normally watch musicals, but the fact that so many A-list actors like Chris Pine and Meryl Streep are in this was enough to convince me to see it. It's such a great movie! The songs are a bit over-the-top at times but that's the point. And it's quite funny. I enjoyed the acting and unlike ""Annie,"" everyone in this can actually sing. I was not aware Johnny Depp could sing. The film can get a bit cheesy but that's the point. Broadway is always cheesy. The film is also surprisingly dark. It's based on the original Grimm Brothers fairy tales and not the sugar-coated sweet Disney versions. (Yay!) The whole film is fun and has something for everyone to enjoy.

118,ayoreinf,So much talent wasted,7,3 March 2015,"It's been long since I've been that frustrated after seeing a movie. I loved all the actors. the cinematography was super, CG live up to current Disney standards, the music barely slows the action down, and still this film is in fact deserving of getting rated much lower than the 7 of 10 I gave it because of all these good qualities. The plot simply deserves about 3 of 10, and that's being generous. To begin with, we have two movies, the first is almost a traditional fairytale story, combining some of the best known stories of our childhood, maybe too many of them, as some are getting a very rushed treatment, but it does look good, some of the jokes could even be called witty, and then we reach the seemingly fairytale ending, and a new movie starts out of the blue. The very same characters change their ways with no reasonable explanation given, the story twists and turns completely out of control. Some characters are getting dropped for no good reason, others get some negligible mention. It looks like (if I'm trying to make sense of the utter senselessness of it all), someone realized all of a sudden that the movie wasn't innovative enough, it didn't have the ""new Disney"" trademarks of modern approach, at least not in a satisfactory measure, so a new ending was stitched in a very coarse style, and whenever something couldn't be explained internally, from the earlier development of the plot, the Wood was blamed, it's all the Wood's doing, that's was the Wood does. Well it doesn't work, and it's so annoying, you want your movie to say something new and fresh, you'd better build it into the plot carefully, Disney's teams have done it before, they created some of the best characters of cinema, they knew that characters are part of what makes us relate to the story and care about what happens on the screen. They seem to have forgotten all they knew - what a shame.",Into the Woods

120,squirrel_burst,Great production and solid performances from everyone,7,19 February 2015,"This is going to be one of those instances where I like the movie, I think it's well made, well produced, very well acted and performed, but my enjoyment of it is hampered by the style of musical that it is. I liked ""Into the Woods"", and I like musicals overall, but I'm also picky about the type of musicals that appeal to me. There are the ones where people talk and then burst into song, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" and there are the ones where people ""sing-talk"" the whole way through, like ""Les Miserables"". I much prefer my singing and talking to be separated from each other, meaning I won't be revisiting ""Into the Woods"" anytime soon, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad movie. In fact, I think it's pretty good as far as Broadway-to-screen adaptations go.I found the plot to be very ingenious. James Corden and Emily Blunt play The Baker and his wife, a childless couple who dream of having a baby. The reason they've been having so much trouble conceiving is because of a witch's curse (the Witch is played by Meryl Streep). She agrees to reverse the curse if they can gather some ingredients, all of which are key elements from four other fairy tales. The film crosses this new story with four familiar ones: Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), Little Red Riding Hood (Lila Crawford, particularly good), Jack and the Beanstalk (Daniel Huttlestone) and Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy). The actions of each character ends up causing, influencing or altering the familiar elements that we have come to love about these timeless fairy tales.I really like the concept of this film and I think it gets pulled off very well here. Seeing a live action Cinderella, that sounds alright I suppose, but we've had a good version of the story available readily since 1950. A twist on the story might have been interesting, but even ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" could only go so far with interesting visuals and changes to the story. This though, this is something special. I like the idea of having all of these fairy tales packed together in the same universe, without turning it into a farce like ""Hoodwinked"" or ""Shrek"". Not that I dislike those movies, but fairy tales poking fun at each other, that's been done a lot. This movie feels fresh in that it also stays pretty close to the original Grimm's Fairy Tales.I suppose a question to ask is ""Is there a reason to watch this film instead of the Broadway production?"" I would say that this is a good companion piece to it, but it doesn't replace the need for big fans to see a live show. This picture does not include all of the songs originally composed, but it makes up for this with some very good performances and excellent production value. I thought the costumes and the sets were very impressive and I can easily see why this, of all the musicals out there was chosen to become a theatrically released film. Meryl Streep deserves praise of course, but I thought everyone was pretty good here. I got a real kick out of seeing Daniel Huttlestone as Jack. I think there's just something about British children singing that is very amusing. I was actually surprised by how convincing the child actors were. I'm always weary of seeing children singing in movies, or in movies at all because often, they're just not on the same level as the other players but the two young performers really did a bang-up job.Just because I'm not on my hands and knees praising the movie, doesn't that it isn't a satisfying experience. I have to admit that I did find it a bit long at times, but that's just me. Even then I attribute it to the mood I was in when I jumped in the theater because when I think back to ""Into the Woods"", I really do think it's quite good. I might not have loved it, but as far as I'm concerned, that's my loss because if ""Into the Woods"" interests you, I think you'll have a great time with it.

121,luke-a-mcgowan,A horrible balance between child-friendly and dark,2,8 January 2015,"Into the Woods feels like a fairy tale being told by someone's drunken and immature uncle, with a stressed out mother doing damage control and censoring the most blatant parts as he goes. Director Rob Marshall should have chosen between darkness and child-friendly. Many of Into the Woods' darkest moments are executed very poorly - deaths are off-screen or reduced to a mere fall. The dialogue and its thinly veiled sexualisation is very painful and the screenplay is cluttered - Rapunzel in particular feels shoehorned into the plot, and the fact that she is the Baker's sister doesn't even come into the story. The music is reasonably enjoyable, but carries none of the emotion, power or impact of superior musicals Chicago, Les Miserables, Dreamgirls or even Jersey Boys. Pine and Magnusson's duet of Agony is by far the most memorable and enjoyable. The performances are adequate - all the characters stumble through with their shallow characters and shallow subplots. Lilla Crawford is insufferably obnoxious as Little Red Riding Hood. Johnny Depp's brief appearance as the Wolf is by far the most entertaining work he's done in the last decade. Anna Kendrick stands out as Cinderella, despite the lack of depth to her plot. The big performances - Streep, Corden and Blunt - are disappointingly mundane. The fact that Streep is such a frontrunner for the Oscar - putting her in the company of truly deserving winners Jennifer Hudson, Anne Hathaway and Catherine Zeta-Jones - is very worrying. Meryl Streep is magnificent in everything, but she wouldn't be in contention if her name wasn't Meryl Streep. Overall, this is the most disappointing musical I've ever seen, and I won't be watching it again.",Into the Woods
122,nicolechan916,A fun film with brilliant acting.,7,29 December 2014,"The cast in this is phenomenal. So many stars and they all did brilliantly. I had not known that this was based on a musical and was thinking there were too many songs in this, but now it makes sense. The songs complimented the story well, and the voices were quite pleasing to the ear. The orchestra especially, created wonderful music that enhanced the atmosphere of the scenes.The acting too was magnificent, and I just about loved everyone in this film. Jack did seem a bit young though, but his voice and acting was good. I also really enjoyed Lilla Crawford's performance of Red Riding Hood. Her personality shone through and she brought about a few laughs. Johnny Depp doesn't appear for very long on screen, but as usual, his character showed his quirkiness. All the other actors and actresses were great too, two thumbs up.However, I'm not quite sure why I did not really like the character of Rapunzel. Maybe it was the actress or the fact that she didn't really do much, but I found her a little irritating. Especially when she kept repeating 'no', I got a little annoyed at that.Rob Marshall did a great job in combining all the stories so intricately and it was really cool to watch it unfold on screen. The story itself is pretty engaging, though around the middle it seemed to lag and the end felt like too many things were happening. Probably because they wrapped up one fairy tale at the beginning and then the three others along with the main story of the baker had to be concluded at the end. Would have been nicer to conclude some of the others along the way, that would've left the middle bit flowing much better too.The effects were well done and the set and costumes were all very on point. I've read that Anna Kendrick and Chris Pine actually got lost on the set of the woods because it was so large. Wow. The overall feel of the film felt a little expressionistic and was definitely too dark to be a children's movie. I was a little surprised, especially since some of the songs were not suited for kids. This really is more of a film for older kids and adults.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Into the Woods
123,akash_sebastian,The Result happens to be just a Beautiful Mess of a Movie,6,16 January 2015,"Being a fairytale musical with such an interesting star-cast and Rob Marshall directing it, I had quite high expectations. Overall, the result turned out to be just a beautiful mess of a movie. The story is just haphazard, doesn't have an intriguing flow, and doesn't have enough heart to make the audience remember it or even like it enough.The singing and the acting is done quite well, especially by Streep, Blunt and Kendrick, but that doesn't save the movie from being an unlikeable mess. Other than a few well-sung songs, there was nothing to feel in the entire movie. I don't remember the last time I was so apathetic to all characters in a movie.With so many underdeveloped characters, a random pointless mix of a story, the movie is as underwhelming as Marshall's previous two ventures. I wonder when I'll get to see his brilliant side again, like the way he was with 'Chicago' and 'Memoirs of a Geisha'.",Into the Woods
124,williampsamuel,"A superbly cast, frequently funny, and dare I say magical musical",8,28 December 2014,"Let me be the first to admit that musicals aren't usually my thing;; especially ones in which every line is sung rather than spoken. Yet I found Into the Woods thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end, and I have a strong feeling you will too. Between its talented cast, upbeat musical numbers, and subtly sly mish-mashed retelling of timeless fairy tales, this is a very fun movie.For those not familiar with the Broadway musical, Into the Woods tells the intertwined tales of Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, and Rapunzel, connected by a childless baker, his wife, and the evil witch who cursed them. The writers of this play and movie have done a very good job of combining the four classic fairy tales, along with the new material into one plot line that is not only coherent but quite clever as well, with each story building on the others and their characters crossing paths in the most amusing ways. And just when you think it's over things start to get serious and we see what happens after the happily ever after.Better than the story, good as it is, is the acting. The filmmakers have assembled a stellar cast of Hollywood veterans and unknowns who bring their smartly updated characters magically to life. James Corden and Emily Blunt make a lovely couple as the baker and his wife. Occasionally bickering, sometimes blundering, the two are clearly deeply in love and will do whatever they have to to break the curse on them, even if they have no idea how they're going to do it. Chris Pines is suitably handsome, charming, and more than a little vain and narcissistic as the hopelessly romantic if rather self-absorbed prince. For her part Anna Kendrick is beautiful and sympathetic, if slightly clueless as Cinderella.My favorite performance was that young Lilla Crawford, who is tough, sassy, and almost endearingly blunt as the freeloading, endlessly hungry Little Red Riding Hood. Watching her beat up the baker and pull a knife on Jack, it's hard to believe the wolf ever got his paws on her. The most impressive and skilled performance however would have to go to Meryl Streep. In her turn as the witch Streep is manic, cackling, alternately frightening and hilarious, and not entirely right in the head. I can't imagine anyone else giving such a delightfully oddball performance and I'm sure she must have enjoyed every moment spent hamming it up.Into the Woods is further buoyed by its excellent score. The titular opening chorus will get stuck in your head, and Your Fault is surprisingly catchy for a rapid fire exchange of blame. It Takes Two and Agony are somewhat less magically, the former being too sappy for its own good and the latter too repetitive and self-aggrieved, but thankfully these are outliers. The cast all sing remarkably well, Kendrick in particular having a beautiful voice.In addition to being well acted and well scored, this movie is also a very funny one. There's plenty of slapstick and physical gags along with some sharp wordplay and hilariously absurd scenes like a half crazed woman frantically trying to steal another woman's shoes right off her feet, or hijinks with a counterfeit cow. There's also a fair amount of darker humor, along with a continual undercurrent of satire which deconstructs the old tales by inserting a degree of modern sensibilities and a small dose of reality, as when the prince admits ""I was raised to be charming, not sincere."" There were however a few parts that didn't quite work for me. Johnny Depp is certainly creepy as the wolf, although perhaps a bit too creepy and the wrong ways, given that it's a little girl he's singing to. And while Cinderella's stepmother's attempts to get her daughters feet into the slipper are certainly comical, they rather macabre for a family musical.Others have also complained that this production as a whole is dark, especially in the second act. They're not entirely wrong. This movie does hint at some very grown up themes and racks up quite a body count for a family musical. But the darker aspects have actually been toned down a fair amount from the source material, and the ending is not nearly as bleak as some would suggest. Far from being that death is inevitable or that happy endings only happy in fairy tales, the moral of this story is that even after deep loss there can be happy endings, even if they weren't the one you were expecting.",Into the Woods
125,dallasryan,My Personal Preference,5,27 July 2016,"Honestly, Into the Woods is a good film. Rob Marshall did a fine job with this movie. The acting, and singing are good. The set design is slick, the movie is solid overall. Rob Marshall is a good director (loved Memoirs of a Geisha), so my critique of this movie is nothing against him. When I watch films I like to see reality of life in them. I like that a lot. But when I watch a musical, in a musical I want to see the happy ending (with the exception of West Side Story, Fiddler on the Roof, and The Sound of Music). I want to see the fairy tale. This is the only time I like seeing the happy ending, in musicals.I get the metaphors and everything that Into the Woods was going for, and I respect what it was because almost no musical ever goes there, dealing with real life themes of not getting your way, tragedy and so forth and so on. But I just, subjectively, don't like seeing it in a musical.",Into the Woods
126,brunovanael,Never mind my review,3,9 July 2020,"I hate Disney and I despise musicals. So it's a miracle I gave 3 stars for enduring this for half an hour. A totally useless review, unless you are not a Disney musical fan and were not aware.",Into the Woods
127,dobbin-4,Starts Solid But Fizzles Out,4,27 January 2015,"I was dubious about the quality of this work before entering the cinema. Although I hadn't seen the musical, I knew that Disney's quality ranges from very good, to cringe-worth bad. What convinced me to see it in the end was solid early word-of-mouth, and curiosity of what they did with the strong cast that was attached to the film. The first half of this movie is very good. Solid performances by Anna Kendrick, James Corden and Emily Blunt keep the fantasy elements in check, and the mise-en-scene by director Rob Marshall is interesting, vibrant and colourful. While it took me a while to take Meryl Streep seriously as the wicked witch, she eventually ended up bringing a large, booming presence to the role that was impossible to ignore. Chris Pine's over the top performance as the Prince was one complaint I had with the performances, but this is minor, as I think he did the best he could with the cartoonish role, and it was a character far more suited to the stage. Another thing the movie does well is the music. This sounds obvious, given that the movie is a musical, but many modern musicals have had boring soundtracks that are bland and perfectly inoffensive in every way. Here, some or most of the songs are at least interesting or entertaining to listen to, and advance the story. The story is quite clever, as it combines multiple fairy tales to make one complete story. It takes a while to take off, but when it does it is a fun ride for the first 80 minutes, and a pleasant movie experience for the whole family.Unfortunately, after the promising start, the movie keeps going after its natural end. The movie goes on for about 20 to 40 minutes long, which again, may have been better and more natural in the stage play. After the movie reaches this point, it becomes far harder to take the cheesy moments seriously. Without spoiling anything, there are some parts of the storyline that are repeated just for the sake of continuing the multi-storied arc (The Jack and the beanstalk story is a noticeable example of this). This would have made the movie shorter, and if they'd done this I think that the movie would have been a very good 100-minute experience. The whole Rapunzel storyline also feels very pointless, and, as it leads nowhere, feels like it should have been left out completely, almost like it is forgotten leftovers that belong in an extended edition.Overall, this is a very good modern musical for the first 80 minutes of the 120-minute runtime. Good musicals are far more rare in modern times than they used to be, and so I was enjoying the experience of this film for the first two-thirds. Unfortunately the weak third-act meant that the movie seriously fizzled out, and the movie ends up leaving a sour taste in my mouth. Score: 4/10",Into the Woods
128,Spideyfan-963-246215,Into The Woods Review,10,9 September 2016,"Into The Woods(2014) Starring: Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, Johnny Depp, Emily Blunt, Meryl Streep, Lucy Punch, James Cordon, Christine Baranski, Daniel Huttlestone, Tammy Blanchard, Frances de la Tour, Billy Magnussen, Tracey Ullman, Lilla Crawford, Simon Russell Beale, Annette Crosbie, Richard Glover, and MacKenzie Mauzy Directed By: Rob Marshall Review Be careful what you wish for Damn it now I have to watch that television show Once Upon a Time. I made a deal with my sister who loves that show that if I liked the next two live action films that were based on fairy tales( Cinderella 2015 and this film) that I would watch Once Upon a Time. You see I'm also not a big fan of musicals or fairy tale movies cause there the same thing every time. And the music has to be real good and in musicals I usually don't like the music. But I did like the cast members such as Meryl Steep, Emily Blunt, Chris Pine and my favorite star in the film Anna Kendrick, which made me have to watch this movie. The film revolves around a baker(James Cordon) and his wife(Emily Blunt) who try to undo a curse that has been put on them by the witch who require them to get various items that make them bump into famous fairy tale characters. A cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, and the slipper as pure as gold. They go into the woods to get each item but the more they get the more trouble sprouts. The story is simple for kids and the film feels dark and takes curvy turns for adults, I'm not sure how much is changed from the source material but I personally don't care I just wanted a good film and that's what I got. The opening is all the characters singing a song about going Into the woods to start their journey and that was my favorite song in the movie. I actually like a lot songs in the movie which is impressive I haven't like as many songs in a musical since Les Miserable(2012). Anna Kendrick has a beautiful singing voice in this movie( I think I'll see Pitch Perfect now) she was of course my favorite cast member in the movie as I stated. Meryl Streep plays the Witch who puts the curse on the Baker(Corden) and she has better singing chops in this film then she did in Mamma Mia. Emily Blunt plays the bakers wife and has sings a duet with him that I enjoyed. Chris Pine plays the prince who is looking for Cinderella and he too has an awesome duet with the prince who means to take Rapunzel in his arms. The rest of the cast did good as well they just stood out more along James Corden. The movies purpose I believe was to be one of the best musicals of its year and retell a possibly classic story. With all the fairy tale characters you know and love. It has no moral but that's good thing you can just enjoy it as a movie with a dark edge on fairy tales. Into The Woods has an amazing cast that let out that song within them in this spectacle on the each famous fairy tale character that is present in this picture with a good script that is fun for kids and edgy for adults, I give Into The Woods a five out of five.",Into the Woods

That all the songs were basically the same tone and speech pattern where all the lyrics except the chorus were in one ear and out the other and sometimes different songs were playing at the same time sounding the same because every character and actor gave high pitched voices?

130,blakiepeterson,A Stellar Musical Adaptation,8,2 May 2015,"I'm a sucker for a good Hollywood musical. Cynical as I am, there is something unavoidably mystifying about a character, depressed or not, bursting into song like it's nobody's business. Some I can't handle — Les Miserables looks less than appealing and Mamma Mia is a show too sing-a-longy for its own good — but the musical, despite having been turned into an ""event movie"" these days rather than a norm, always brings something special to the table that other genres cannot. A Woman Under the Influence might happen to you, but there's no way that your life could turn into a reflection of Singin' in the Rain. We go to a musical film to absorb the joys of song and dance, two things we can hardly experience in the tough 'hoods of da real world.As big, long, and exhausting as it can sometimes be, Into the Woods is one of the best examples of a Hollywood musical gone right in recent memory. Adapting the legendary stage play (written by James Lapine and scored by Stephen Sondheim) is no easy feat — Sondheim's lyrics are so, so complex and specific and Lapine's story is truly epic — yet somehow Into the Woods takes our doubts and seduces them all away. As someone with no knowledge of the original play, besides the understanding that it's a big deal and fans were simultaneously panicked and excited when it was announced it was becoming a movie, I can say that, as a film, it's something of a wonder. When we hear of a movie being ""large"" these days, there's a tendency to imagine a superhero action flick or some post-apocalyptic chase film. So when a movie as old-fashioned (ignore the CGI and overall ""modern"" look) as Into the Woods comes along, where its biggest assets are songs instead of suspenseful battles, it's impossible not to be impressed than it is so universally likable. I don't mean universally likable like grizzled bikers or 99-year-olds will have a good time seeing it; I mean universally likable like the naysayers, the doubters, and the fanatics will find something to like. As someone who enjoys musicals but not too much singing (sue me), I was surprised to find myself pleased by the film, even though songs come by with the frequency of a new Kevin Hart showcase. It is characterized not just by its music but also by its humor, its awesome cast, and its overall magical touch.You could say the storyline has the effortless messiness of a Robert Altman film — so many characters, so many motives, so little time. At the front and center are The Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt), who live in poverty and are living unhappily ever after. Why? The Baker's Wife cannot bear a child. This isn't due to bad genetics though: it seems a vengeful witch (Meryl Streep) has placed a reproductive curse on The Baker, whose father robbed her of her earthy goods back in the day. The Baker and his wife, however, are not the kind of people that hear this and cry rivers of sorrow, backing away — they instead take The Witch's offer to bring them their deserved fertility. They must embark on a quest, the deadline in three midnights, to find a blood red cape, a lock of silky blonde hair, a milky white cow, and a golden shoe. Bring all these things to The Witch, and they will get the baby they've always wanted.As you may have guessed, these items lead to other fairy tale staples, like Little Red Riding Wood (Lilla Crawford), Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy), a pre-beanstalk Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), and Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), not just surface-level, but emotionally. Red is a feisty girl as quick to snarl as she is to pout; Rapunzel is mad at her mother (The Witch) for locking her away in a tower while her Prince awaits (Billy Magnussen); Jack, after he climbs his infamous beanstalk, angers the giants in the sky, who want violent retaliation; and Cinderella isn't so sure about royalty and isn't so sure that Prince Charming (Chris Pine) is the man for her.Into the Woods is absolutely irresistible during its first act, filling itself to the brim with involving characters, biting humor, and impressively performed songs. But once the happily ever after (?) of those first 75 minutes are over, the film takes a turn into darker territory, where happiness doesn't last forever and harsh realities come to light. This is probably the biggest issue with both the film and the play — the second act feels like a blackened sequel or an attempt to extend the length of the story — but where most have found this to be a fatal flaw, I find it fitting. Sure, I would have preferred Into the Woods to be shorter, but as the plot dives into the shadows, the charm of the film hardly goes down with it. Fact is, this is a great movie, a star-studded event that welcomes you into its world and remains a hospitable host.I don't know if the film will end up being watched over and over again by your musical obsessed cousin in the same way Mamma Mia was, but if Into the Woods isn't consistently a fluffball then consider it a masterwork in movie-making (filmmaking is a whole different ballpark). It's grand. It's epic. It's game-changing. The director who made Chicago cool again (Rob Marshall) has outdone himself, and so have his actors.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",Into the Woods

I love musicals, but I find his incessant punning bloody annoying, and while I can appreciate the technical ability required of his performers, I think he's often better served in theatre rather than cinema, where such light-operatic excesses are easier to swallow. Burton's visuals in 'Sweeney Todd' made that transition from stage to screen work. This doesn't. Meryll Street should be kept away from music as she overacts grotesquely (I had horrible 'Mama Mia' flashbacks), as does Chris Pine. Visually it is unremarkable, which given the fairy-tale subject matter, is very surprising. Depp tries to make the Big Bad Wolf creepy and letchy, and largely succeeds.

This movie honestly was nothing but a living and breathing brainwash to ruin your life and even your IQ. First, this movie had repetitive singing and music that become annoying and beyond dreadful. I would never recommend someone watch this filth. The movie started off with the repetitive, and dreadful singing and they were singing into a very awkward manner. Second, little red riding hood and the big bad wolf (Johnny Depp) seemed like there was going to be a serious rape going to happen or even worse that it would be a consensual, yet illegal love. To top that off Johnny Depp was only in the movie for 5 minutes. Little red ridding hood was a terrible and emotional less actress and singer. This movie also, shows irresponsible choices are OK and immoral values. The only good thing about this movie was that it was so bad that it was funny. The two princes song ""Agony"" will honestly make you laugh. The movie starts off well with making connections with all the stories but then everything else goes down hill. Cinderella's prince apparently cheated on her with the baker's wife. Jack apparently kills the giant's wife. Majority of the characters died, and wouldn't you believe the last song is basically saying that now that they're on their own they should choose what's right and wrong and whats good and bad.

This movie is like Les Misérables where they sing 90% of the dialogue. Just putting out there but if you don't like that just know it has a lot of it. Moreover, all the cast is doing a pretty good job: from Meryl Streep (once again Oscar nominated for best actress in a supporting role) to Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt. I do like good music in a movie and every song was really in tune and blend well together. Plus, I like fairytale as I grew up with pretty much all of these, to the point where now I missed Robert Carlyle as Rumpelstiltskin and his ""All magic comes with a price dairy..."". However, in the third act the movie kept going past a point it should not and that segment of the film is a little bit disappointing and almost boring. Finally there are actually some twists and turns in the final quarter that conflict with everything from the beginning. The last 25% kills the mood of the previous 75%. Overall if you like fairy tales and musical you are going to like this film as it takes everything from your childhood and weave it to one giant story. The performances are solid and the movie pretty much worked for what it was.",Into the Woods
134,mgruebel,Sondheim+Disney = Flawed Magic,6,5 March 2015,"""Into the Woods"" intermingles the fairy tales of Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel, and Red Riding Hood in a complex, but for the first half fairly deftly plotted meta-fairy tale. A bewitched baker must bring back an item out of each fairy tale so that his wife may conceive, along the lines of the Sondheim musical.Meryl Streep is almost as superb as Bernadette Peters playing the witch. She symbolizes all the mothers who can't let their children grow up and leave the house, keeping Rapunzel locked in a tower and the young prince at bay for as long as she can. Rapunzel happens to be the baker's young sister, stolen by Streep as a baby to exact revenge on the baker's father, who visited her garden one night and made off without spilling the beans.Speaking of sexual innuendo: Although this is a Disney movie, the undertones of sexuality present in many of the original fairy tales (wolves predating on girls, princes climbing up hair into otherwise inaccessible towers, girls sliding down soft red gullets, and so forth) are certainly far more pronounced than in the usual Disney tale. It's just subtle enough so that parents need not worry too much about their little ones. The film's scary moments and adult talk are closer to Shrek than to Terry Gilliam's ""The Brothers Grimm."" After all, it is disneyfied Sondheim - or is it sondnefied Disney?The movie suffers from an occasional missing song, and at least to my ears, mixed voice talent. It also loses it at the end, when it comes to handling the many characters and multiple sub-plots in the second half of the film, after the seemingly happy ending unravels. There are just too many characters and loose plot ends to deal with in the short screen time. Some characters just disappear (Rapunzel - ruining Streep's sad moment of ""I told you so""). Others literally get sucked up by mud before their whole story is told (more Oedipal imagery for Streep). Yet other characters, like the giantess seeking revenge for the husband whom Jack killed, remain vague so they can be killed off by our heroes without making us feel too bad. But wasn't ambiguity the whole point?Still, I have to give this film credit for pulling off something a little different in the fairy tale genre, like Terry Gilliam tried with his ""The Brothers Grimm."" It's worth a watch, even though ultimately it does not quite satisfy. Still better, go see the next production of the Sondheim musical play, or watch a Gilliam movie.",Into the Woods
135,stephendaxter,A fun and enjoyable musical for the whole family,7,9 January 2015,"Into The Woods was a fun and enjoyable musical that incorporated some of your favourite Disney fairy tales into one interconnected story. I will start off by saying that if you do not like watching musicals you will definitely not like this movie, it plays out as a musical for almost the entire runtime so if musicals are your thing then this may be of interest to you. The story for the most part was quite easy to follow and each individual storyline was simple and interesting enough to stay interested. The performances were all very good from Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt to Anna Kendrick and Chris Pine, there was not a single bad performance, but at the same time there was no real standout performance i thought. Meryl was still probably the best of the bunch as the witch but not enough to stand out above the rest. One of the issues i had with the film was the sudden switch in story and tone that happened just after the half way point. I liked the last 45 minutes of the movie less than i enjoyed the first hour and 15. It had a very abrupt and messy switch that was supposed to come as a surprise but took me out of the film for a little while. The rest of the movie was also a little darker and harder to enjoy as much, if the same tone had played out to the end i may have liked it more than i did. In the end this musical is enjoyable to watch for both kids and adults and also provides some pretty good and catchy songs - 6.8",Into the Woods

137,BabelAlexandria,Should Have Ended at Happily Ever After!,7,31 March 2021,"This movie is something of an enigma, but not intentionally so, I think. Its greatest merit is the sense of foreboding from the dark woods; the songs are not particularly good, as my children both commented. The weaving together of Grimm tales is also interesting, but not so clever as to form the basis of a movie. Well, they went with it anyway, and if they tied together fairy-tale favorites in the first part, in the second they unravel them, or at least the premise of a happy ending, when the dead giant's wife attacks in the midst of Cinderella and the Prince's wedding ceremony. Everything from here on out is uneven, sometimes downright bizarre, and sends questionable messages to children (was that really the point?). I'll point to just one: the baker's wife commits adultery (well, a kiss and a fantasy) with Cinderella's prince while they are alone in the woods, and dies soon thereafter. Huh? At least the widowed husband invites the infant child and the rest of the broken fair tale characters, including a motherless Jack and an estranged Cinderella, to live with him in his house. But that's not exactly a happy ending.On a personal note, this was the first movie my daughter saw in the theaters, at about two and a half-years (I know - I think she just thought it was scary). She was sick around Christmas time (2014) and we were staying at a hotel near the mall so that her newborn brother wouldn't get sick as well. She went to sleep about half-way through. Thankfully!",Into the Woods

The all star cast may seem ridiculous, however the cast is incredibly talented and they all provide great performances. The songs were great, none of the cast struggled in the singing itself. It is just close enough to Broadway that you can tell that it is a theatre adaptation and the tone is wonderful. The plot succeeds very easily when considering that it was written thirty years earlier. The effects work well and are not overdone. Costuming is not very complex or interesting excluding Johnny Depp's version of the wolf who is dressed as one would be in the Broadway show. The movie overall is carried by the amazing cast and their beautiful Hollywood quality soundtrack.",Into the Woods

140,rprince-832-6294,"Let down. Not terrible, but not great. Or that good.",5,12 January 2015,"-Into The Woods is a film adaptation of the popular stage musical, a combination of a bunch of stories like Jack and the beanstalk, Rapunzel, Cinderella, and Red riding hood, which focuses on a baker and his wife who must set out into the woods to collect things for a witch so she might lift a spell off of their house.-It sounds like I am going to hate on this movie, and it really was not too bad, but there were a lot of flaws in it. Take in mind a few things: 1. There are good things about it and 2. I never saw the stage musical, so if I judge something at fault in the original I am faulting the film for not adapting it better.-The story is interesting. It was fun to see all these characters together, but the way the story was adapted ran over a bunch of scenes like actually going to the ball or climbing the beanstalk. I understand they are not scenes in the woods, but I felt somewhat shorted by this film's lack of possibilities.-The pace was messy to say the least. The first part takes forever and then it rushes other things, switching focus unevenly. And then the finally was good! Until it kept going. Aaaaaand going.-The acting was pretty good. Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, the kid who played Jack, James Codren as the baker, Emily Blunt as the baker's wife, Meryl Streep as the witch, Johnny Depp as the wolf, and Chris Pine as the prince, all did a great job. I was VERY impressed by Chris Pine. Everyone else was very iffy. The stepmother, red riding hood, the other prince, the baker's dad, Rapunzel, etc.-The characters were interesting as well. I liked the way the characters' personalities were written. (or adapted) I didn't like how the film would not let me like the characters. Jack was good, but his inexplicably abusive mother was out there. Cinderella was confusing and the film editing did not help. The witch was fun, but lacked actual motivation for like anything other than trying to look 10 years younger. The baker and his wife were trying to steal things from kids and pretty girls. There was a song to try to get the audience to try to forget that. The first prince was fun and easy to root for, until he wasn't. The second prince looked like he was in a boy band.-The costume design, production design, sound, and makeup were all pretty good.-The music was eh. I liked a few of the songs like Agony, the wolf's song, or Cinderella's song. The rest of the songs either just blended in or were the 45 minute versions of Into the Woods. Seriously the first Into the Woods lasted 16 minutes.-The film had some really clever moments in the writing and characters that I enjoyed.-Into The Woods is rated PG, but has some moments and themes not suitable for young kids.-I know it doesn't sound like I have a lot of good things to say about it, but I did enjoy some of Into The Woods. I did not enjoy inconsistent characters, a poorly paced film, or songs more repetitive than Les Miserables. Still, its production design, convincing acting, and humor make it worth watching on Netflix or Redbox. I would give it a 6.5.",Into the Woods

142,magnuslhad,junk,1,6 August 2015,"Fairy tales were historically very dark, and Into The Woods was, apparently, a successful musical that mined this original Gothic content to great effect. That tone, had it been achieved in the film, may have been intriguing. What we get instead is a musical where all the songs sound the same, that is marketed as a kids' film and kind of is till a false ending halfway through when it turns uncanny and muddled. The film fails completely to find its centre, so that the biggest surprise comes at the end when we realise 'THIS guy is the main character?"" Budget seems to have been a concern as set pieces like Cinderella's Ball are conspicuous by their absence, and a Giant is pitifully implied descending through clouds then dead with his boots up. The ending tries to be a morality tale, but no one seem quite sure what the moral is. I learned many lessons from Into The Woods, the main one being not to let our 10-year-old son pick the Friday night DVD ever again.",Into the Woods

145,paul_3-960-896774,Oh so that was Into The Woods,5,30 January 2015,"I thought I was the musicals loving kind but turns out I'm not. I could barely sit through Les Misérables and the only reason I sat through Into The Woods was its comedic aspects. It was almost a parody at times, they didn't seem to be taking themselves too seriously, so it was funny. Not laughing out loud funny but it put a smile on my face. There is a wonderful combination of all the famous fairy-tales in one story. They've incorporated the drama, the comedy of these tales, and obviously added a music into the new story. They've humanized our fairy tales characters, adding a little more edge to them, making the story is somewhat interesting but not enough for me to be invested in it. Although the singing was good - I'm talking quality here - I wasn't blown away by the songs, I didn't once want to sing along and I can't remember a particular song I like, except maybe the Merryl Streep one from the trailer. It's a nice ensemble of a cast, they've picked the right people for the right roles. Depp is right in his wheelhouse but he's not on long enough to be annoying. Streep struggled to get me on board with her character but by the end I was in. James Corden & Emily Blunt are a lovely pair, they were great together and Blunt really impressed me - mostly because her and musicals, I mean singing, didn't ring true - she was good and really stood out for me. One last thing about the cast, I liked Pines in the movie ONLY because he delivered my favorite quote from the film ""I was praised to be charming, not sincere."" @wornoutspines",Into the Woods
146,FilmMuscle,Into the Never-ending Muddiness of the Woods,5,29 December 2014,"When a Broadway musical meets incredible success, it's bound to hit the silver screen sooner or later, and in 2014, Into the Woods makes that highly anticipated transition. 'Tis a story that places all of our favorite fairy tales (Rapunzel, Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Little Red Riding Hood) into the same universe and in close proximity of one another, for that matter. As a result, many of these characters end up bumping into each other as they selfishly focus on their own separate goals, consequently causing disastrous conflicts in the meantime—quite an original concept for a genre that's frankly been growing stale in the world of modern storytelling. However, what frightened me most about this particular cinematic adaptation was the fact that it was being produced by none other than Disney who has put it upon themselves to brighten every story nowadays and turn every slightly mature tale into a kid-friendly blockbuster (recently completely ruining the essence of one of their most diabolical villains for the sake of appealing to little kids in this year's Maleficent). Being that the stage play of Into the Woods is such a refreshingly dark and twisted take on the fairy tale, chances were that Disney would find some way to substantially tone down the material in the end, and—what do you know—it's exactly what happened. In fact, a certain major character is revised to avoid her gruesome death, which makes for an awkward result in the story. The majority of the film takes place in the sheer darkness of the woods and the menacing fogginess of the swamps. It's with this persisting bluish hue and the vastly darkened multitudinous colors that Rob Marshall is able to create an utterly gorgeous and unique fantastical production. In my mind, there's no doubt that the film's strongest elements lie in its art/set design and overall visual presentation. Of course, the music is its central showcase as well, and it's totally satisfying, riddled with plenty of (dark) humor and clever rhythm. If you're not into musicals however, there's very little here to convince and draw you in unlike something to Les Miserables' effect, given the prolonged music numbers and their recurrent frequency throughout the narrative's duration. With such an impressive ensemble from the likes of Emily Blunt to Meryl Streep to Chris Pine and Anna Kendrick, there's enough personality here to entertain until its elongation becomes ever more transparent towards its last half-hour. Meryl Streep, in what I expected to be a fully hammy performance, once again manages to showcase her stunning talent and rein the silliness of the role in. After being defied and transformed into ugliness, she entrusts a baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) with a task. In order for the wife to become fertile (after a curse the Witch placed on the baker's family tree due to a misbehaved father) and finally birth a baby for the married couple, they have to retrieve four objects for an ultimate magical spell that will also restore the Witch's beauty: ""a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, hair as yellow as corn, and a slipper as pure as gold.""The premise of the picture, itself, promises a sharply satirical and considerably grimmer version of the fairy tale world but its themes, messages, and intentions become so heavily muddled by the end and are delivered with such a weakened impact that Into the Woods largely concludes without its initial charm. Not to mention, the musical drags on for far too long (despite only running for a little over 2 hours), especially in its last act which seemed very out-of- place and unnecessary. The issue with this entire production is that it goes on from making one obscure point about the unrealistic nature that fairy tales traditionally possess and starts chasing another one as yet another predicament falls into the characters' laps. By its last act, the narrative—more than ever—just appears sloppy and ill- conceived/executed, not knowing exactly when to end and when to move on from its loquacious characters and long-winded songs. Hopefully, the Broadway musical is more competent.",Into the Woods
147,tinovalkki,Boring and lame with bad script and soundtrack...,2,5 April 2015,"It is always a big risk try to rewrite classic fairy tales. Particularly when you try to combine four classic fairy tales under a one script. If you try to polish classic Grimm tale to suitable for young children fairy tale you have a impossible task to accomplish. Into the Woods try to do this with four classic Grimm story. Every scary things has removed and try to fill them with stupid story of childless bakery and his wife. All the whole original story has totally wiped out and fulfilled with odd script and all you have left is total mess. There is many good actors in this movie, but with stupid story and bad script you won't get anything out of them. Not even Johnny Depp as wolf won't do any good. Only Meryl Streep's witch is worth to watch. Badly set woods with weird story and bad CGI effects will finish the mess. Musical score is lame and boring. It feels like there is only one song in the whole two hour musical. It is a shame that Disney won't take care of production values enough. I am so scared what they will accomplished with Star Wars. I just hope that Star Wars cost much enough to Disney, that we don't have to witness Luke Skywalker to sing a boring love song with Ewoks at woods of Endor. Movie looks so cheap, soundtrack is lame and boring and all that combined with bad CGI-effects and all you have is left totally boring Disney musical with nothing left from original fairy tale magic.",Into the Woods

Then, when everyone gets lost in the woods in Act Two and the giantess tries to get her revenge, the movie seems to bog down completely and becomes an utter bore, and we have to listen to endless lugubrious, tedious, Stephen Sondheim songs, and it's torture for me and for all the 10-year-olds in the audience. I would have been perfectly happy if it ended at the False Ending, but that would not be our wistful and melancholy National Treasure, Stephen Sondheim, would it?

149,jaredpahl,A Good Sondheim Adaptation Makes for a Great Modern Musical.,8,1 May 2020,"A Stephen Sondheim musical provides completely different pleasures from most other musicals. They aren't about jaunty tunes and family fun. They're intimate, dense with growing meaning, and more than a little sinister. The music functions not as separate parts of the story but as story amplifiers. And so, despite the surface level entertainment in Rob Marshall's Into the Woods, the film is always working at least one level deeper. Sondheim's influence is that strong, and the film is that pleasurable.Into the Woods, which began life as a broadway play in 1987, is branded as a mashup of mature takes on famous fairy tales. Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, and others are tied together in a sprawling, interconnected fable on childhood, parenting, repression and fidelity. It's such rich material to start with, both as a lighter family friendly remix on old staples and as a more sophisticated allegory. Rob Marshall competently directs, moving the story along, hitting beats, and indulging in the occasional flourish. However, he does not ring everything he could from Sondheim's ingredients. The movie never goes as dark as it suggests it could. Without spoiling anything, there is a through line of death and sexuality in Into the Woods. To lean hard into these elements could be absolutely fascinating, especially juxtaposed with the childhood icons the story centers on. Unfortunately, Marshall sanitizes a lot of the edgier stuff. He seems to be a director in love with the crowd-pleasing classic musical, a love he utilized to extraordinary heights in his Oscar-winning Chicago, but seems occasionally at odds with the story here. A perfect adaptation of Into the Woods needs a director who isn't afraid to alienate a segment of the audience looking for an unchallenging romp. Marshall challenges no one, but keeps Sondheim's ideas, all the same.I don't see it necessary to recall the best musical numbers, because the songs don't function as ""numbers"" per se. Sondheim songs melt into the story rather than stand out from it. To the point where, when the movie is running at its best, you almost don't notice where song ends and dialogue begins. That's not a knock on the melodies, which emerge nicely in the opening mega-ballad, Giants in the Sky, and Agony. Otherwise, the lyrics and mood of the music is what is most appreciated. The songs grow and build and meld together in interesting ways. You listen closely to the words, and enjoy the rhythms on a more subtle level.The performers may be the most roaringly successful aspect of the film. From what I can tell, this is a musically inclined cast, full of great classical singers. James Corden is oddly impressive in a major role, Johnny Depp has a memorable cameo, and Chris Pine does fine work as Prince Charming, although the female leads, Anna Kendrick, Meryl Streep, and a luminous Emily Blunt, excel best. Kendrick is the best singer of the bunch, Streep has one or two great scenes and one show-stopping song (Stay With Me), but Emily Blunt is the best of both worlds. She gives a superb, run-the-gamut performance, going from funny, to heartfelt, to warm, and motherly. As charismatic a turn as I've ever seen from her. The child actors who play Jack and Red are also really impressive singers, who carry tough roles extremely well.Into the Woods is one of Stephen Sondheim's three best plays, and with the talent involved, my expectations for this adaptation were enormous. In the end, it's not perfect. Rob Marshall shies away from the unsavory cynicism of the play, crafting a more palpable middlebrow entertainer at the expense of something really daring. But every technical department is doing solid work here. The film looks and sounds like a million bucks. It's staged well, acted with enthusiasm, and directed handsomely. Even if it's not a revelation, a good solid adaptation of Stephen Sondheim is still a much appreciated treasure.81/100",Into the Woods

151,eschetic-2,A not flawless but generally wonderful film version of INTO THE WOODS,9,26 December 2014,"A group of us went to the approximately 80% full 6pm screening of INTO THE WOODS at the Ziegfeld in Manhattan (most people at Christmas dinner? The 2pm show was apparently sold out) with a very mixed audience of theatre folk and families who applauded (more than justified - one of the joys of seeing a film musical in its first weekend; no one ever applauds later) three of the numbers and the film itself at the end. I'd have applauded four or five.I don't consider myself an INTO THE WOODS fanatic, but I did miss two of the cuts (the reprise of AGONY with its capping joke ""ah well, back to my wife!"", and the the Baker's final moving ""No More"" which almost certainly was filmed since they left in the set-up and lead out) but so much of the rest was so well done that I couldn't honestly complain, and I could understand the practical necessity of the cuts to keep the film close to a two hour event for the benefit of *exhibitors* who want as many showings as possible in a day. I do hope however, that at least the ""No More"" is restored for the DVD release as they restored the similarly essential ""Cool, Cool Considerate Men"" to the DVD of 1776.My main reaction was that ""the curse is finally off films of Sondheim musicals!"" This was by far the most satisfying ""movie""/film version of any of the Sondheim musicals - and I include WEST SIDE STORY and GYPSY. Director Rob Marshall seems back on the track he was with his marvelous CHICAGO after his botch of NINE.As for INTO THE WOODS for the ""uninitiated,"" it will probably not be for *every* audience - there was one family down front which walked out when the show got momentarily very dark near the end, and anyone insufficiently sophisticated to accept individuals singing in moments of high emotion (what a sad life they must live!) will probably be better entertained elsewhere - but between the award-worthy stellar performances of Streep's ""Witch"" and Corden's ""Baker"" (with the possible exception of Johnny Depp's ""Wolf,"" probably cast because of his role in the film of Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD, there wasn't a weak link in the cast; the unexpectedly big voices of Lilla Crawford's ""Red Riding Hood"" and Daniel Huttlestone's ""Jack"" were a special plus! Even Tug as ""Milky-White"" and her doppelgänger gives a fine performance!), Jonathan Tunick's lush orchestrations, the handsome LOOK of the film (the little touch of a collapsing tower significantly improves on the time spent on stage showing the destruction wrought by Frances de la Tour's Giantess) and even the touch of near-camp (I normally loathe camp) with the Princes' (Chris Pine & Billy Magnussen) literally bodice-ripping ""Agony,"" this is a film a lot of us will see a LOT of times with great pleasure. The Marshall film of INTO THE WOODS is not flawless - the two afore-mentioned trims to the score are, in the end acceptable, and Johnny Depp's ""Wolf,"" while not horrible (it looks like something left over from ZOOT SUIT) made me understand for the first time how clever it was in the original to have one of the Princes double as the Wolf! 20 hours later though, I can't honestly recall any serious problems worth mentioning. (One minor ""spoiler"" here if you don't already know the show:) Director Marshall may have dithered over whether or not to actually kill off Tracy Ullman's excellent ""Jack's Mother"" in ""Act II"" and didn't get the shot to show her die - and didn't understand or ""get"" the ironic humor in the horror there; she's still moving when last we see her, even if the Baker later tells Jack she's gone! It's a nit which, even if picked, is quickly forgotten in a blissful adult evening about how, ultimately, ""no one is alone"" that's good enough for kids too.If it doesn't prove to be one of the TOP grossers of 2015, I trust it will do well enough to prove to the Hollywood ""masterminds"" that you can still have a successful movie-movie of a stage show which has been faithfully preserved *first* in its original stage version - just as those filmed Sondheim stage musicals themselves (and the MTV broadcasts of LEGALLY BLONDE!) proved to producers wise enough to notice that audiences are MORE likely to flock to something they already know they like!One last, but relatively important point: I'm mildly shocked at the number of posts on IMDb who A) complained that none of the advertising for one of the more famous MUSICALS in the last quarter century (that toured all over the country and has been aired on national television several times) ""warned"" people that it was a musical (I rather think that the Disney ads for their Cinderella should warn people that it *isn't*!) and B) warned people not to take children! As a 66 year old university lecturer, uncle and former elected member of a Connecticut Board of Education, I'd seriously question the fitness to *BE* a parent of anyone who ""sheltered"" their children (over about age 3 - any child old enough to sit through a church service) from a film like this rather than *talking* with them about it!I can certainly understand anyone not sophisticated enough to understand the idea behind musicals - that people sing when the emotions are too great for mere words - OR not caring for the length and subtlety of Sondheim's melodic lines and variations (different strokes for different folks) but this INTO THE WOODS is, perhaps, the greatest teaching opportunity I've seen in years for a *good parent*; you owe it to your kids. Don't miss it!",Into the Woods
152,ilikeimdb,"Note: This movie is faithful to the stage production, for better or worse",8,25 December 2014,"Into The Woods (2014) isn't a reimagining of Steven Sondheim's musical -- instead, it's a mostly faithful transposition of the stage production onto the big screen (blessedly shortening the 2nd act). In that respect, it's a triumph of reasonably careful casting and a restrained use of special effects. The actors, most of whom have singing parts, acquit themselves very well (the baker less so in terms of singing). Certain pacing problems arise naturally from the approach taken: Everyone wants to clap after the many musical numbers. The flow stops after each song, breaking the continuity and giving the movie an unnatural pace. This was especially true after the Princes' big number -- clapping burst out spontaneously (and deservedly). Some musical numbers seemed to lack Sondheim's dark intent, in particular the Witch's ""Last Midnight"" where someone in the audience actually laughed afterwards. Ouch. And if you haven't gotten the message from other reviews, let's just say this isn't your typical end to a Disney movie. I suggest this movie is inappropriate for anyone under 12/13. Sondheim's mature themes won't play well with the little ones. // That said, I still give this 8 / 10 for a very good rendition of the stage production. If you like this 2014 version and haven't seen the 1997 filmed version with Bernadette Peters and Johanna Gleeson, you owe it to yourself to check it out.",Into the Woods
153,cnycitylady,Deceitful,3,18 September 2015,"There is a reason Into The Woods was booed off of Broadway. This laughable excuse for a musical effectively destroys all of your favorite childhood fairy-tales. Cinderella, Rapunzel, Jack and the Beanstalk, Red Riding Hood, you name it. The characters are all selfish with nigh a redeeming quality in the bunch and to top it off there is not one single catchy tune in the whole of the movie. You'd think that a story about beloved fairy- tale characters would be cheerful and fun, but this is not. It's dark. And even if it gets points for originality it loses more for making you believe that all will end well when it doesn't.If you want to look at positives then Lilla Crawford steals the show as Little Red and Chris Pine's musical belting of ""Agony"" is hilarious, but other than that, skip it.

Obviously, being released by Disney it's more of a family oriented film. People do die off screen but it caught me off guard with all of the darker stuff. I feel like they tried to mix the 2 together and make it somewhat of a dark yet light type of movie and it didn't succeed.The songs themselves weren't all that entertaining except one of the last songs in the movie which I really enjoyed and it was performed and filmed brilliantly. There was one point in the movie when I thought it was over, yet there was another 45 minutes. That tells me I was bored for the most part. People will disagree, but it was slow and with only a few funny lines here and there, mixed with it trying to be a family film with dark material, I can't give this higher than a 4. A bit of a disappointment.",Into the Woods
158,rjsf96,A Fairy-tale to Leave One with Wonder,8,13 January 2015,"Disney has had a good track record in the past with musicals – although they were hand drawn animation. 'Into the Woods' is live action and fully embraces the fact that it originates from a Broadway play. The film directed by Rob Marshall has a playful quality to which I would have thought him incapable of applying. Yes, he did direct the fourth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, but this film never descends into those levels of mediocrity.What we are shown is a superb juggling act of multiple stories and plot strands that never feel underdeveloped or weak, instead interesting and always fun to watch, it seems to seep through the very fabric of the film itself.The opening song alone of the same name as the film should give it an Oscar nod for Best Original Song. It combines all the plot details of four separate character strands and does so, while being engaging for the audience – it is no small feat.'Into the Woods' features four key fairy-tale characters each with their own story to tell. These are Rapunzel, Jack and the Beanstalk, Red Riding Hood and Cinderella. Yes, they are familiar – but the songs combine rhymes and poetry as if it was the simplest task. There are also the Baker and his wife who long for a child, and must search for four magical items from each story in order to have a kid, and break a curse that the witch has placed upon their bloodline. Trust me it sounds much better when sung by the characters and pretty funny as well.It has to be mentioned that the film is theatrical, for better or for worse. This will entirely depend upon your own opinion. The acting is supposed to be over the top and the film likewise reflects that, this doesn't mean the acting is bad, just that the film is stylistically different and must be taken into account. I for one liked this choice and felt that it became its own entity, with a personality to call its own.There are three actors that particularly shine above the rest. First off, Johnny Depp in a supporting role that lasts a measly 10 minutes or less in length. Yet, he still manages to make an impression as the creepy, somewhat paedophilic Wolf – consider that true acting talent. Secondly, James Corden normally restricted to the medium of Television actually does a top job here and has no shortage of comedic moments to show off his true talent. Lastly, Anna Kendrick is stunning as Cinderella and I don't just mean in the beauty department. She gets her chance to sing and of course impresses. She manages to bring true depth to what would otherwise be a one dimensional character and expresses true thought and emotion as she struggles time and time again to dance with the Prince.The good far outweigh the bad and so I come to the negative aspects of the film. I have to admit that Meryl Streep seems completely at odds with the rest of the film. She overplays, becomes hammy and downright annoying. Although for the most part the film is an exhilarating musical, the last thirty minutes are completely unnecessary. The film goes darker in tone and loses the fun along the way.Thankfully the first ninety minutes are a delight. They offer some of the greatest songs ever produced in the last ten years of the film industry and above all it (almost) always retains a sense of fun – the song 'Agony' starring Chris Pine is a prime example. So I urge anyone old or young to watch this film – it never takes itself too seriously, always entertains and never loses focus among its many plot threads. All in all, this is a trip to the woods actually worth the journey.",Into the Woods
159,vistheindian,Lost along the way,5,1 February 2015,"Quickie Review:A witch has cursed the family of a baker, preventing him and his wife from having a child. However, the witch offers to lift the curse in exchange for four items, which the couple must obtain in three days. In their quest to obtain the items they cross paths with other fairy tale characters who have their own wishes to fulfill. This movie is based on Broadway musical and as such almost 90% of the movie is told through songs. While the songs are not particular catchy, the story of the quest is interesting enough to hold your attention. Unfortunately the movie keeps running for 30 mins too long making a potentially nice little fantasy film feel like a drag.Full Review:I'll admit, musicals aren't one of my top genres of film. Of course I love Disney animations and there are other musicals that I've enjoyed, but I'd never go out of my way to watch a musical. Still considering the cast and the possible fun to be had by mixing different fairy tales into a single story, I was curious. For the most part I had fun with it until I thought the movie ended but kept going.First of the world created in this film is very impressive. The set design, costumes, and the magic-isms (by that I mean CGI), were all well realized. It felt like a Disney animation fairy tale setting and I enjoyed that a lot. Mixing all these fairy tales could have made for a really incoherent story, with plot holes all along the way. Thankfully that was not a problem at all, even with the songs it was nice to see how everyone's story was tying in together. Majority of this movie is told in songs so there better be good singers involved and there are. None of them were breathtakingly beautiful, but they were not horrible either. There was not another Les Misérables, Russel Crowe situation. It was all going pretty well until the words ""Happily ever after"" were about to be uttered and the filmmakers decided to add another act.The single most frustrating thing about the movie is the last 30 mins. I can honestly say that if it weren't for that addition to the movie I would've rated Into the Woods a lot higher. But that's not the reality of the situation and it brought the rest of the movie down with it. In a way the movie is a one and a half story. One story is about the witch and the quest for the four items, the half story is about a giant trying to get revenge. There is a subplot in the main story involving the giants because of Jack and the Beanstalk. However, that wasn't very important to the quest so I did not understand why that subplot needed 30mins of resolving. Perhaps for the film they decided to omit some parts from the musical involving the giants in the first half. If that was the case then the ending should still have been removed because it completely nullifies the character development made in the rest of the movie.It really is a pity about the treatment of the ending. It led me to check the time on couple of instances, that's never a good sign. In the end I cannot recommend paying to see this in cinema, it's just not worth your money. I have never seen the original musical but I can guess that the fans of that will also be really disappointed due to the missing story plots.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Into the Woods

162,ahegde3149,Interesting but felt a bit rushed in the third act,6,1 July 2015,"I had neither heard about Into the Woods before nor I am a big fan of musicals. I found the intertwining of the fairy tales of Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella and Rapunzel quite interesting. But these are not your happy ending fairy tales, it is more dark and depressing for kids. The 4 stories are combined when a baker(James Cordon) and his wife(Emily Blunt) are sent on quest by a Witch(Meryl Streep) so that a spell which made them not have children could be lifted. There are quite many characters here and I feel the film gives enough focus to each one in its apt 2 hours run time. I found the songs quite good and lyrical. Agony, The Last Midnight and Moments in the Woods are my favorites. For the first 2 acts the film is not so dark and depressing, but the last act was kind of complex and not so cheerful. I felt it was a bit rushed towards the end in the way different characters end up at one place. Also I felt Rapunzel's story line was abruptly ended. Anyways I think it tried to say real life is no fairy tale and bad things do happen. The special effect, production design and make-up, hair styling all were great and made it an immersing musical experience. Speaking of the cast, Meryl Streep was awesome as usual, Emily Blunt and James Cordon put up an honest act and Anna Kendrick was good as Cinderella. Johnny Depp didn't shine much in a tiny role as the wolf. Overall, I liked Into The Woods and found it unique plus intriguing. If you are not much into musicals I suggest not to bother about this one, otherwise I feel it was a good enough film.RATING: [3/5]",Into the Woods

164,valen060,The Moral of A Real Happy Ending,8,25 December 2014,"There's so much to describe regarding 'Into the Woods.' Since it's one of the works of Stephen Sondheim that was written back in the 1980s as a stage production, I was already intrigued on what the Disney film adaptation would be like. Director Rob Marshall did a fine job leading this ensemble cast to how we the audience expect them to be seen as on film. It's a musical that isn't sugarcoated with stereotypical, elementary-level Disney music traits (i.e. breaking into both song and dance), instead it had more mature elements that raises the bar in terms of content, including angst that is channeled well into the musical numbers. Not since 2002's Chicago has he ever arranged a musical in the most vibrant of ways. I understood that some changes and omissions had to be done to make it family-friendly and nothing TOO adult, but nevertheless I was focused and willing to see everything play out.Basically, it all begins when a baker and his wife are confronted by a witch to collect certain items for their wish to be granted and having an old family curse lifted. At the same time, other fairy tale characters in the likes of Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, and even Rapunzel have their own stories played out. Eventually, their lives collide through both success and ultimately consequence.The entire cast performed really well with the most interesting of songs as well as some wittiness in a few of them. What captured my attention was young star Daniel Huttlestone as he really stepped up his game following off his success in the 2012 film Les Miserables with both spunk and cleverness. Johnny Depp was a real trickster as the Big Bad Wolf and is very reminiscent of the sly, Zoot suit-wearing, wolf from old 1940s Tex Avery cartoons. Depp's past involvement with Stephen Sondheim in 2007 as Sweeney Todd was a real show-stopper from beginning to end, but I felt that his role in this musical was petty, even if the early previews credit him alongside the main cast. He deserved more credit than that (albeit a short one), but I understand what the Wolf's fate would be like as in the original story.With an abundance of positive buzz going about through various critic reviews, I can see why award season will not ignore it in the least. It had drama, humor, and a hint of suspense that I was left bewildered and in awe. The first and second acts of the entire movie kept me focus since the songs used were rather enchanting, but as the third act started rolling in, I expected much more out of it than what was shown on screen. Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep were incredible, but Anna Kendrick should also have the same amount of recognition for her exceptional performance. Her portrayal as Cinderella was something of a kindred spirit who wants nothing but the best for her own happy ending like the others. I kind of liked how these fairy tale characters crossed over to help each other out, even with all the trouble they've endured in their own lives to begin with. Given its dark nature and adult situations, the movie as a whole remained faithful to the original production. Sure it has its imperfections and content that felt a little too adult for a PG rating (not to mention Rapunzel's story could've expanded further), but my thoughts for a good moral of this entire musical is laid out like this: Although we may find our happy ending, it's how we handle it through both truth and consequence soon afterwards.",Into the Woods
165,moviescoundrel,"Unique, but not Amazing",7,11 January 2015,"As stated above, I didn't really know what to expect with this film. As a family film that seems to be a bit geared for families or theater goers it is definitely a different kind of film. The miscellaneous all-star cast fill various fairy tale roles, some felt legitimate, some quirky, some perfect, some not. The characters have multiple agendas and goals, whether it is Little Red Riding Hood who needs to get to her grandmas house, Cinderella who has her eyes on attending a multiple-night royal ball, or the two princes (Prince Charming and the prince who yearns for Rapunzel), many of the characters are going ""into the woods"" in the beginning of the film. The film starts out witty and interesting. As the film progresses things are less realistic (as typically prevalent in a stage to screen musical) and more plot holes develop. About ¾ through, things are wrapped up rather neatly, too neatly the viewer feels, and things take a turn for the dark and interesting. I didn't particularly care for the way things transpire at this time as they just were not that interesting and a little too dark. There were also some things that made no sense, such as the characters discussing forgiving the giant and not killing them and then simply killing them anyway. I did like the ending overall as a mixed bag of things happen in an unclean way, yet still happiness transpires for the most part, similarly to how things happen in life much of the time.",Into the Woods

This is the first play to film that I have liked. And I think that is mainly because of the sets and the photography. The acting may not be Oscar worthy but this follows the story of the fairy tales gone to reality. Fairy tales are just that and this is more with reality in the endings. The singing is fun, the stories are fun, the presentation of the stories is fun. I went to the movie to be entertained and I was - I knew the songs and they were presented well - not Broadway quality - but fun. My favorite is and was Agony. This is a good ensemble cast - and I feel much better seen on the big screen. I was entertained and that is why I go to movies.",Into the Woods
168,vinsond21,What happens after 'happily ever after',9,15 January 2015,"Into the Woods is a cautionary tale that is not for all tastes. Those who are open to new experiences will enjoy this visual feast that features familiar fairy-tale characters like Cinderella, Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood and Jack who went up the beanstalk. The 'woods' of the title is really a wilderness in which the characters encounter trials, temptations and times of testing. Those who survive this wilderness will come out learning about love and forgiveness.This is a big-screen version of the Broadway musical by Stephen Sondheim. The music will not appeal to all listeners; those who are not familiar with this work will either be turned off or end up as fresh fans. Such audience will likely find that the movie improves with repeated viewing.Speaking as a long-time Sondheim admirer, Into the Woods is not among my favorite works of his (see below for that list). Nevertheless, this musical has its share of songs that I have enjoyed from the first time I heard them. My favorite, Giants in the Sky, is performed with great poise by Daniel Huttlestone, who gives Jack a commanding presence in the film. If Broadway or the West End is looking for the perfect Artful Dodger in a revival of Oliver!, young Dan Huttlestone is the obvious choice right now. Tracey Ullman is also very convincing as Jack's world-weary mother, while long-time Sondheim fan Anna Kendrick gets to strut her stuff as a Cinderella torn between heart and home.Besides Giant, other numbers that i love include Emily Blunt's and James Cordern's It Takes Two (a delightful duet between the Baker and his Wife); Anna's On the Steps of the Palace (wistfully sung by Cinderella); Meryl Streep's Last Midnight (powerfully belted out by the Witch); Anna's and Lilla Crawford's No One Is Alone (a reassuring duet); Meryl's Stay With Me (tender rendition by the Witch); Emily's Moments in the Woods (the Baker's Wife reflecting); Daniel+James+Anna+Lilla's Your Fault (four characters blaming each other); Chris Pine's and Billy Magnussen's Agony (two dashing princes hamming it up in a catchy duet) and Children Will Listen (the haunting final number). Audiences will do well to heed the advice in the lyrics: ""Careful the things you say, children will listen; Careful the things you do, children will see... and learn. Children may not obey, but children will listen; Children will look to you for which way to turn, To learn what to be... Careful before you say 'Listen to me', Children will listen!""The opening montage that introduces the various characters is handled very well. The production design and costumes are marvelous too. Years ago, there was a made-for-TV version of this musical that may be worth checking out for comparison.(Just for the record, my favorite Sondheim musicals are Company, A Little Night Music, Follies, Pacific Overtures and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.)",Into the Woods
169,Mobithailand,Truly awful - it beggars belief how many awards and nominations it garnered.,1,31 March 2016,"Ever since I saw West Side Story at the cinema back in 1961, I have been a glutton for musicals. At that point in my life, the only musicals I had seen were on film.Prior to West side I had seen numerous 20's and 30's black and white musicals with such luminaries as Astaire and Rogers, and then in the 50's there were films like Oklahoma, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, and even the highly rated Singing In The Rain, all of which all left me unimpressed. Okay, they were mildly entertaining, but not in a way that would tear at my heartstrings, or carry songs that may inspire me.Westside Story changed all that, with its gripping story and the sensational Bernstein songs.Then came Andrew Lloyd Webber, with Jesus Christ Super Star and Evita and I was totally hooked on the musical genre. I saw both of these gems on stage in the west End, and then on film, and in both instances the films' directors made a pretty good fist of it. Jesus Christ was clearly made on a very low budget and these days it looks a tad corny, but in its day it was every bit as powerful as the stage show, and very cleverly done.Then, much later, Evita was made into a film starring Madonna, and I still believe that this was the best film adaptation of a stage musical ever made. Madonna pulls off the performance of a lifetime and the Director, Alan Parker, was inspired. This is one of the few movies I can watch again and again – and never tire of it.But Evita and Jesus Christ are the exceptions rather than a rule, and most film adaptations of musicals fail to maintain the magic of the original stage productions.I hated the film versions of Phantom of The Opera, Mama Mia, and Les Miserables, even though the latter two were box office hits.But I am not writing about these old musicals. I am writing about Into The Woods, which is the film adaption of a renowned stage musical by America's Stephen Sondheim.I have not seen the stage version of the musical so I am unable to compare it to the film, but I have to admit upfront that I am not an enormous fan of Sondheim songs. Most of his songs are admittedly tuneful with some very clever lyrics, (such as in Sweeney Todd), but unlike Lloyd-Webber, Schönberg and the Bernstein's' of this world, most of Sondheim's songs are instantly forgettable, with some rare exceptions.(Such as ""Children will Listen"", which happens to be one of the main featured songs in Into The Woods).The film has any number of 'Name Stars': Jonny Depp, Meryl Streep, James Corden, Emily Blunt, Chris Pine, Emma Thompson, and many more.Unfortunately, none of them can sing.I frankly doubt whether I would have enjoyed the stage version of this musical, because Sondheim musicals leave me kind of cold, and the story – which is a mishmash of 4 different Grimms' Fairy Tales – is neither amusing, nor exciting, nor heart wrenching. Nobody really gives two figs who dies and who lives happily ever after. The Daily Telegraph, in their wisdom, have given the film four stars, (out of five), and the reviewer calls it 'Pure Pleasure', going on to say: The film is a whirl of pure pleasure that just keeps whirling. Mind you, I was pleased to see that even this smitten reviewer admits: Sondheim doesn't write show-stoppers.Really? I thought that was the whole point of musicals??The Guardian film critic gives the film three stars and talks about a clutch of very fine performances.But they can't sing!!!! And it's a musical!!!As with several of the Oscar nominated movies that year, there seems to have been a total disconnect between the arty-smarty film reviewers of New York and London, who mainly seem to love it, (Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes in their 'review of reviews' both give it 3 ½ stars out of 5), and the movie-going public, who, by and large, seem to hate it.On the internet Movie Data Base (IMDB), the first 11 user-reviews gives the film a single solitary star out of ten and they carry such headings as: Horrible!, Save your money!, Horrible Mess!, Walked out!! LEAVE the Woods!!and many more. (I didn't check any further.)And yet folks, this very boring, unspectacular, badly sung musical, garnered no less than 3 Golden Globe nominations (including Best Film – comedy or musical, best actress and best supporting actress), two Bafta nominations , and no less than 3 Oscars, including best supporting actress – for guess who? Yeah, you got it, the film Goddess who can do no wrong – Meryl Streep.And yet SELMA, that wonderful, truly inspirational movie that faithfully portrays a crucial part of American 20th Century history, and will undoubtedly become a film classic was totally ignored by BAFTA, and received only two Oscar nominations, of which only one was in the main Oscar categories. (Best song - which it won - deservedly so.)It seems to me like a clear case of giving all the gongs to the luvvie in-crowd.I actually wrote this review long before all the 2016 Oscar hoo-ha over the lack of Oscar nominations for people of colour. Nuff said..",Into the Woods
170,AttyTude0,Horrendous and sick!,1,24 April 2015,"Oh, my goodness, where do I even start. Hubby rented this horror based on Sondheim's fame (inexplicable, if ITW is anything to go by) and because he always wanted to see the musical. I love musicals so I said OK. We both paid dearly for our rashness.IMDb demands that reviews should be at least 10 lines long. I could write ten pages and and that would not be enough to express how much I hate this film. And yes, I completely agree with those who say there are disturbingly sick issues in it. For example, I found the scene in which the evil sisters, who were punished with blindness, are shown stumbling around, wearing dark glasses and carrying white sticks (get it? dark glasses with period costumes? Hah, hah!),revolting offensive and in bad taste. Physical disabilities are nothing to laugh about. Ask anyone who is afflicted by them.The music - if I may so call it - is bombastic, unmelodious, and maddeningly repetitive. I don't care what ""the critics"" say, Sondheim is no Andrew Lloyd Webber, and that's a fact. The characters don't sing. They screech like banshees (granted, that may be more the composer's fault than theirs), and if you close your eyes you can barely tell one from the other. The scene in which Meryl Streep sings The Last Midnight is very probably what a witches' sabbath looks and sounds like. Characters are totally unlikeable and right from the start I didn't give a toss about what happened to them. Cinderella seems to have more teeth than necessary for any practical purpose. Prince ""Charming"" is a common-looking individual with a five day stubble and a 1950s hairdo straight out of West Side Story.

171,JTurner82,Terrific translation of classic crossover musical.,9,1 January 2015,"In 1987, composer Stephen Sondheim and writer James Lapine collaborated to fashion a rather warped but darkly entertaining musical called INTO THE WOODS. It's a sort of ""crossover"" fairy tale which answers the question of ""what if Cinderella, Jack from the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, and Rapunzel all crossed paths?"" Linking this eccentric collage together is an original story thread about a baker and his wife who are cursed by a vengeful witch to never have any children. The witch is willing to reverse their predicament if the couple can retrieve the necessary ingredients to provide a potion. Although the first act deceptively seems to end the show on a ""happily ever after"" note, along comes Act II which twists the conventions of fairy tales upside down. Things begin to fall apart. Characters betray one another. Some even die. Bittersweet though its final resolution may be, INTO THE WOODS nonetheless proves to be a work rich with cautionary messages, flawed characters, and a surprisingly deep amount of intelligence.It is extremely ironic that the long-awaited movie adaptation is a Disney production of all things, especially since the overall tenor of the musical clashes with the Mouse House's usual reputation of toning down much of the darker, violent aspects of the Grimm Fairy Tales. As it turned out, though, the marriage of Disney and Sondheim couldn't have been more ideal. (Amusingly, the lively title tune for ""Into the Woods"" recalls a classic era of Disney long since forgotten.) Considering that the Mouse House has recently been turning its own fairy tale conventions on its head with their recent and massively successful FROZEN, INTO THE WOODS turns out to be a perfect fit just like Cinderella's glass slipper to its rightful owner. Rob Marshall has done an outstanding job of translating the musical to the screen; from the first frame of the film, where we hear a disembodied narration intone the words ""once upon a time"" followed by the two-note clang of Sondheim's overture and a cross-cutting opening between the primary characters, the show exuberantly comes to life. Marshall clearly understands the tone of the story and laudably remains faithful to the mood of the musical.Even having said all this, there are some elements of the show which unfortunately didn't make it into the translation. In the musical there is a narrator who serves as a character to the story; later on in the second act he is bumped off (No, seriously!), which causes the characters and the story to go completely off-rails! (Naturally, this wouldn't work for the medium, so instead it's the baker who does the narrating, which is fitting considering how the show ends.) As mentioned, there is also a high body count, with one of the victims being Rapunzel. In this version, Rapunzel survives instead and rides off with her prince, but even then it is still presented in the film rather ambiguously.Loyalists to the show will probably still find some things to carp about aside from those; two songs are cut (but as a compromise, we hear the melodies as background music instead). These include the jubilant ""Ever After"", which concludes Act I and the somber, reflective ""No More"" from Act II. Frankly, though, even with such ""changes"", there is very little else that INTO THE WOODS loses in its new dress.Helping matters along is the very fine cast of actors, all of which provide fantastic performances, both on an acting and vocal level. (The latter is especially crucial, because Sondheim's songs can be very difficult to sing.) As the witch, Meryl Streep turns in a performance that could easily garner her another Oscar. She is simply marvelous in the part; her bombastic turn in the witch's climactic number ""Last Midnight"" in particular a wickedly glorious highlight. Anna Kendrick has the perfect fairy tale heroine voice for Cinderella, while James Corden and Emily Blunt excel as the Baker and his wife. Johnny Depp growls and snarls in his brief cameo as the Wolf (and his second bigscreen Sondheim musical to date). Both Daniel Huttlestone and Lilla Crawford are outstanding as Jack and Little Red Riding Hood; it is refreshing to see both parts portrayed by actual children for a change. Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen contribute to the film's funniest scene, ""Agony"", in which both lament their seemingly impossible quests for finding their wives, and suit their princely roles quite charmingly. Seriously, I could not find fault with anyone in this cast.Visually, too, INTO THE WOODS looks quite pleasing; rather than adopting a lavish, big, over- the-top style, Marshall and cinematographer Dion Beebe use computer enhanced effects rather sparsely, opting instead for a richly dark and gritty color palette. Nothing about the sets or effects looks fake; even some of the more potentially implausible moments, like birds ""communicating"" with Cinderella, are handled with a simplicity that works well, and the witch's transformation scenes are effectively done without being overly ""showy."" Only a brief, trippy interlude where we see Little Red Riding Hood toppling through an abyss of billowing blankets as she recounts being swallowed by the wolf in her amusing ""I Know Things Now"" may strike some as a bit artificial, but even then it is done quite artfully and in a way that does not come across as distracting.Rich with moral ambiguity and with a twisted, macabre edge, INTO THE WOODS is treated with the respect it deserves for its big screen treatment. With a terrific ensemble cast, fitting cinematography and skillful direction on the part of Marshall, any omissions or changes are more than compensated for by the efforts of everyone involved. Admittingly, your mileage may vary when it comes to enjoying this movie, but for anyone dreading any sort of ""Disneyfication""s of whatever kind can gladly put such fears to rest. Major kudos to everyone involved for doing justice to this much loved musical.",Into the Woods
172,DarthPaul85,"So close to greatness, yet so maddening. (spoilers)",7,27 December 2014,"I saw this movie, and everything was *awesome!*......until Act I ends. Before I get to negatives, let me say the music is very faithfully reproduced here. The singing is good (in some cases great), the acting is good, the costumes and ""sets"" are also often good. Everything was in place to make this the definitive version of Into The Woods......and then they threw Act II out the window. People unfamiliar with the musical might not notice or care about the changes to Act II (or technically Act III), but fans of the musical should be warned that this show is completely drained of all gravitas and pathos. Also, several wonderful songs have been cut- it will tick you off. SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!So if you've seen the musical, you know how Act II goes. More importantly, you know the great songs there. Well for some reason (PG rating, perhaps), Disney has cut everything about Act II that gives the entire show meaning. #1- Rapunzel does not die. This ruins the Witch's arc in Act II. No reprise of Children Don't Listen, and the witch leaves the movie rather abruptly in Last Midnight. And of course, Rapunzel is almost completely pointless to the story now, since nothing bad ever happens to her and her prince stays happily married to her, which brings me to...#2- No second ""Agony."" This was my favorite song in the damn show, and they cut it. Of course, the cut everything building up to this too- We don't get to see the princes and their wives tire of married life, nor do the baker and his wife, which comes to...#3- The Baker and his wife have no troubles in Act II. There's no fall from grace for these two- they never have to deal with a stressful marriage. The wife only kisses the prince (no sex), and the action leading up to that point is far from justified. Her lyrics about ""And/Or/Both"" are groundless here- it's still a fun song, but there's no reason for her to be singing it. #4- No Narrator. He shows up as an apparition, but does not get to sing ""no more,"" which is the other best song in the musical. This also hastens the Baker's journey- while he still hits the main points of his arc, we're denied any real struggle here. #5- Arguably, the entire point of the musical is missing. The stage version breaks down ""happily ever after"" and teaches a real lesson about loss and how gray the world really is. The movie...does not. So I can't really recommend this to fans of the musical, unless you can accept the loss of Act II. People unfamiliar with the musical might still enjoy it.",Into the Woods

So I don't know who to blame about this movie, is it the source material? is it the adaptation?The cast is amazing and the songs are not bad. But the rest is a mess! After the first 20-30 mins the story itself was also lost in the bloody woods. An never ending parade of famous fairy tales characters with no purpose or any interest. Surprisingly for a film of this kind, the art direction and the cinematography were uninspired. Awful really, just a blurry dark feeling that didn't contribute, on the contrary made things even worse.Despite the efforts of the brilliant actors, this movie isn't even bad enough to hate watch.

174,A-Shekhar,Worst movie ever,1,10 January 2015,"72% on Rotten Tomatoes - the critics have always been biased towards a Disney movie with a big budget and powerful cast. I don't get it, Rob Marshall couldn't have made this crap even with a proved story and concept handed to him, a list of powerful cast lined for him, the most powerful movie production and distribution company in the world backing him and this, he comes up with this. A messy, repetitive and down right irritating torture of 2 hours. I have never written a review for a movie and yes there are times when able directors waste our time - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for example but this movie, it wasn't just a waste of time, it was torture. My rating, 1/10",Into the Woods
175,palacerevolution2000,Tried several times,3,28 October 2019,"I am a huge Sondheim fan, and also of many of the actors in the film. But this was a mess. But I also had not realized just how badly Disney had mangled and chopped up the story line and plot.
First off I am a little disappointed in the songs. They were almost inter-changeable; very similar. And as great as Johnny Depp is as actor, he should not sing. Ever. He already ruined ""Sweeney Todd"" for me. Meryl Streep, one of the greatest actresses of our times, is also not the best singer.
But the biggest issue I have is the non sense plot. I was left speechless after Act 2. It makes no sense. The giant, Rapunzel, the princes - why even bother having them in there to begin with? Their story lines fizzle out. The witch, a major player, just kind of disappears. the notion that the baker's wife had sex with the prince came out of nowhere, and went nowhere.
It would not have been a very respectable tale, but ultimately the film version should have just ended with a happy ending during the big celebration and wedding.
But it is supposed to be a completely different moral in the B'way show; and this isn';t dealt with AT ALL in the film.
PS I do find it ridiculous that there are reviewers taking offense with Depp's character, and his actions. I mean - come on: it s a fairy tale. Those stories are grim, wolves eat little girls and then they crawl back out to life That's the way things are done.",Into the Woods

However, the first half of the story is well connected based on its rich materials but the second half shows some pacing issues and the existence of questionable moral etiquette stops it from becoming a classic of the genre as compared to Les Miserables. The great musical elements, the spirited performance of the superior cast, stunning visual effects and a number of heartfelt moments do help the film stands as an enjoyable musical flick, even if it doesn't work entirely as a whole.",Into the Woods
177,GoUSN,Top tier entertainment in every regard,9,2 January 2015,"OK, so after reading some of these reviews by upset theater-goers I'm enacting a new rule: if in reviewing any film you've read the book/seen the play/were there when it happened, you have to issue a warning when reviewing. The warning will be required to disclose your personal hurt if anything about the book/play/your memory is not faithfully, exactly, precisely, reproduced on film.This, as a film, with stars and CGI and brooding scenery and wit, is a triumph. It makes brilliant use of all of its ingredients. The acting. The music. The landscapes. The sounds. The visuals. The playful comedy.First, the acting. In a musical (or light opera, which this is) the acting is presented mostly through music, secondarily through dialogue. The trick for the director is that folks should not remember or be dwelling on the differences between the two - it's a unified presentation of a character through song and speech. Done perfectly here.Second, the music. If a musical is well done, with superb characters and acting, the takeway isn't ""what's with all that singing?"" The music and song become part of single tapestry, each thread carefully woven into the whole. Done perfectly here.Third, the landscapes and visuals. How best to create an other-worldly oddly medieval (but not) land where fairies, witches and giants reign? You do it the way this film did, through a mix of fanciful and real. A-plus.Fourth, Cinderella's line ""I really don't mind cleaning"" is so rollickingly funny, I'm still recalling both the line and the delivery many hours after the film ended. And this was just one such moment. The film was full of laugh out loud lines where you could barely believe that a line of such wit and creativity could be written, then uttered so perfectly by a highly skilled actor.Go! This is visual, cerebral, aural film-making in its highest form. Unless you're the type to insist that an experience in film EXACTLY REPLICATE the book/the play/the whatever, you will thoroughly enjoy this experience. To the production team, the actors and anyone else involved, thanks for a great evening of sublime entertainment.The one sour note: Johnny Depp. Miscast completely.",Into the Woods
178,nitestar95,Song and dance. No story. Not Sondheim's best work.,5,18 September 2018,"Only for those who absolutely adore all musicals no matter how terrible the story. The songs are not memorable. The acting, same. You won't re watch this. The plot; what plot? If you remember the fairy tales of your childhood, you'll be disappointed, because none are here in entirety. This is a mish mash of several childhood stories, all entangled, so nothing makes any sense. Why five stars? My musical loving girlfriend liked it; not loved it, but liked it. Did she ever want to see it again? No. And that's why 5. I was able to watch the whole thing through without feeling like I had to escape the show. While I love some of Sondheim's work, this looks like something created because he owed someone a score. You want to watch great Sondheim, you'll enjoy watching West Side Story the 100th time more than you will watching this.

179,dutchs-1,Just....Plain....Awful,3,30 March 2015,"I'll cut a movie a lot of slack if it entertains me, and I thought Snow White and the Huntsman and Maleficent were actually better than their detractors made them out to be. And the remake of Cinderella is a masterpiece. But this movie was just plain awful. I realize it's an adaptation of a musical by Stephen Sondheim. That doesn't make me respect the movie so much as wonder if Sondheim is badly overrated. The musical numbers are as appealing as cats fighting, and have a Bollywood sort of disconnection with the story. The story itself is a mash-up of Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood and Rapunzel, tied together by the story of a baker and his wife, who is barren because of a curse placed on the baker's father by the wicked witch next door. In order to undo the curse, they have to get a pure white cow (Jack) a red hood (guess who), a glass slipper (also guess who) and some golden hair (Rapunzel). Turns out that Rapunzel's and Cinderella's princes are brothers. Rapunzel and her prince pop in and out but seem mostly to be there to add another story to the mix. Cinderella gets her guy and the birds that loyally adore Cinderella peck out the eyes of the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters. Say this for old time fairy tales, they didn't pussyfoot around. But just then the ground shakes and part of the palace collapses because a second giant is on the way to avenge the first one. So we plunge into a seemingly interminable coda. Cinderella's prince tries to seduce the baker's wife and realizes he can't leave his philandering ways behind. Cinderella realizes she wants a simpler life. The baker's wife, Jack's mother and Red Riding Hood's grandmother all die, so the survivors all agree to live together as one big, weird family. Oh, did I mention that after the curse is lifted, the baker's wife becomes instantly pregnant and has a baby? Meryl Streep is okay as the witch, but hardly Oscar quality, Johnny Depp is smarmy as the Big Bad Wolf, but the rest of the acting is histrionic at best. Jack and Red Riding Hood recite their lines with all the grating stiffness of a grade school class play. A thoroughly amateur piece of work.",Into the Woods
180,Haplo-4,"Not a musical, not really a saga",5,8 January 2017,"Sure there are some positives about this movie. The premise is great and to some extent it all falls together beautifully. But I have some complaints.The biggest problem is the voice/role of the storyteller. It is supposed to tie everything together. But for me it is annoying only. Extend the movie by 30 minutes and make proper bridges in the story. Secondly, there is not enough singing. Compare with Mamma Mia (2008) or Les Misearbles (2012) which is singing only, this is somewhat around 50/50. Not a proper musical. And some of the songs are somewhat bland. I would prefer the non-trained voices of Pierce Brosnan or Rusell Crowe if they come with engaging numbers. Meryl Streep is good, but better in Mamma Mia (2008). Anna Kendrick is perfect by all accounts. So are Emily Blunt, Lilla Crawford and Chris Pine. Johnny Depp is sadly typecast.The ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" story line is not properly developed. Nor is the ""Cinderella""-story line. The mere adding of some dialogue here and there (not the voice over though) would have sufficed. As it stands, the story takes too big leaps occasionally.The voice of the storyteller is not ""saga"" enough. It is too modern and would have benefited from a more mature male or female voice. The voice of Dame Maggie Smith would have been much preferred. Or Ian McKellen or some other classically trained actress/actor. Now, the voice over is provided by James Corden. He is good in his role, but his voice does not suffice for the story teller.I would have been glad to recommend the movie. But sadly, don't prioritize it if you are not a solid fan of Disney movies. The visuals are top notch though!",Into the Woods

182,archiecm,"The ""music"" grated on me. The ""songs"" bit the big one.",5,26 December 2014,"Not sure there are any spoilers this time but I always check that box just to be safe. Here's what I wrote my sister about this film: ""Saw ""Into the Woods"" and hated the singing. It's almost all singing and except for one segment, all the songs aren't songs at all but irritating notes that don't relate, like some disgusting note salad."" Sondheim is famous but he certainly didn't live up to his reputation in this one. It's just a jumble of notes. They don't turn into pretty tunes. Instead the melodies wander up and down the scale like some cat trotting back and forth on a piano. Having the actors give the lines without music would have been preferable, like actors doing soliloquies in Shakespeare. I can visualize them conveying a mood, the content and inflecting their voices to convince us of their roles and their emotions. Singing aimless notes JUST DID NOT WORK. None of these songs will make it onto the radio. None of them. The princes singing at the top of the waterfall might be the only exception. I don't know if their song was a lot better but because it had a pleasant melody, I practically passed out -- I was so relieved. I enjoyed the way the story kept on after the happy-ever-after but at the same time I was so angry at Sondheim by then I couldn't really appreciate it. Someone actually paid him to write that crap? I could have done better . . . . in my sleep.I do want to say something about Streep's character, the witch. Her song about loving her ""daughter"": and not wanting to lose her doesn't wash. She was nothing but Rapunzel's jailer. And the idea of protecting her was baloney. Real love is giving not depriving. Rather than wanting Rapunzel to be enriched by living and by experiencing successes, she wanted to keep her jailed like a pet bird. The sentimental song was just that -- a sentimental song and of course it had a very forgettable melody. The ultimate proof of her selfishness was to throw her into the swamp when it came out that she had a lover. She was truly a witch and got what she deserved. My question is if you're writing a musical, how can you keep a straight face when you give a selfish ugly person sweet loving lines to sing in a supposedly sincere ""I Love You"" type song. I mean wouldn't you realize it would make the audience vomit?",Into the Woods
183,fawn_jane,Don't Bother,4,16 January 2015,"Plot makes no sense. The beginning premise of trying to break a curse is a little silly, but it's something. Halfway through the movie though, the curse becomes irrelevant to the plot but inexplicably, the movie keeps dragging on.The movie tries to be both satirical and serious, but fails at both most of the time.This musical has too many songs that drag on and on with pointless lyrics, scenes that seemed to have been put in just to fill up time. It's like they made it up as they went along.The only saving grace about this movie is some pretty special effects and the actors. We've got a star- studded cast with favorites like Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt. I was surprised to see Johnny Depp in this movie, in what was pretty much the worst role of his career.

184,DragoonKain,Great adaptation of the first act,8,4 January 2015,"I've seen the stage production of this play, and it's one of the most cleverly written musicals of all time. This film adaptation is very true to the source material and has some of the best performances I've ever seen. It is an excellent production definitely worth seeing at least once. Disney adapted the first act of the play pretty much perfectly ... and it's not your standard Disney movie.Sure there were cuts, and they simplified things, in particular they cut out all of the breaking of the fourth wall gags, and narrator's role in the story was almost completely removed, but it's surprising how close they stuck to the original musical, and weren't afraid to shy away from the play's darker elements. Still, this isn't a bad play to take your kids too, there are mature themes, but the lessons are important ones that kids should learn as a part of growing up.That being said, the adaptation started to lose it's way towards the end when it got to the second act of the play, which occurred about an hour and a half into the movie. They were running out of time and they had the whole second half of the play to go so they basically did a hatchet job to the second act and squeezed it into the remaining 30 minutes. This was unfortunate, because the second act of the play is probably the most brilliant part of the musical, but the movie had to cut huge chunks of it out due to time constraints. As a result, a lot of characters just disappear from the story without any explanation and the movie leaves a lot of loose ends unresolved. It all feels quite a bit messy, and I can see people feeling unsatisfied with the ending if they haven't seen the play.It's films like these that make me think we need to bring back the intermission. Back in the day you could see a four hour film like Gone With the Wind because there was a nice 15 minute intermission in the middle. People could get up, go the bathroom, buy some snacks, and then come back to see the second act. This film would have been perfect for that sort of structure, because it was exactly how the original musical was structured. But no, they had to awkwardly compress it to two hours. Oh well. I still enjoyed it.",Into the Woods
185,myspecialparadise,Good And Bad,7,29 March 2015,"I've read a few of the other reviewers views of this production, and though I agree with some points, I also disagree with others. Trashing a production that has such unbelievably wonderful talents that did far better than what was obviously badly written for them to work with. Yes, the problems are numerous ... so numerous that one wonders how this film made it to actually being viewed by an audience?! The answer is quite clear ... the casting director, the writers, and probably even the director, could not destroy the very fine and intricate talents of many of its all-star cast members. Unfortunately, miscasting was evident in a couple of the parts. One major mistake was Johnny Depp accepting the role of the wolf! I would have used Tony Todd in that role, at any age. No one wants to see Johnny Depp in a role where he's drooling over a little girl like some pedophile, and that is the exact image I got from the scenes with Johnny Depp! Tony Todd could get away with this role ... Johnny ... you can't!Frankly, I preferred the movie to the play. The play goes on to ruin Snow White and Sleeping Beauty ... and we discover there aren't four Princes for four stories ... just the same two cads!That said ... lets chat about Little Red Riding Hood ... is Uncle Walt churning in his grave over this one? He sure should be! Turning Red into an obnoxious little thief with no redeeming graces what-so-ever, shame on Disney. These characters have entertained children for a few hundred years, or more, and to take all the hard work of some of our greatest children's' writers and destroy it all in one movie. that sucks pimentos! However, given the part she had to deal with, Lilla Crawford did quite a good job in destroying Little Red Riding Hood's image. Too bad ""Red"" can't sue Disney! Hey, would that make an interesting movie? NOT!Meryl Streep, absolutely wonderful, as usual. She brings the role to life like few others could, if any could! Meryl constantly proves to us that she is an actor/actress to be reckoned with ... to the point of being one of the best actresses in the world today! And so versatile! I love this woman's talent, and wonder if her friendship with Shirley Maclaine might not have helped her improve an already glorious talent. Can't wait to see what she tackles next! I will say this ... if the other reviewers keep you from viewing this production, you will miss a huge amount of talented actors/actresses that kept this film from being shredded for it poor writing and etc.! My favorite line of her's ... ""I was just trying to be a good mother!""Daniel Huttlestone, as Jack, is absolutely precious, and quite lovable in the part. Such a fine talent in one so young ... Patty Duke, eat your heart out! This young man has a wonderful future in films as long as he keeps on the straight and narrow. Daniel is a huge delight in this production, and should be enormously proud of the fantabulous job he did with this part. I should also say the same for Tracey Ullman in the role of Jack's mother ... such a surprising delight to see her in this role. Her part was not huge ... but she made it memorable indeed! I loved her choices of costumes, if they were her choice, and I think they had to be. I'd like to see more of Tracey in films, as well as Daniel Huttlestone.Cinderella ... huge disappointment. She just didn't fit the image of a shabby girl covered in cinders becoming a beautiful Princess that no Prince could possibly let get away ... attractive, yes ... but Anna Kendrick is no iconic Cinderella! However, even with her limitations, she played her part quite well ... I have no criticisms about her acting, for she knows her craft quite well. She just didn't not fit into Cinderella's glass slippers. Which reminds me ... how arrogant of anyone to change the iconic ""Glass Slipper"" into gold fabric. Shame, shame, shame! What's next ... changing Dorothy's Ruby Slippers into burlap? The parts of the two Princes were perfect ... both being a banquet to the eyes of any woman, or gay, to feast upon! To miss their adorable number together at the waterfall would surely be a miss to be regretted! Prince's so seldom ever got the chance to have much of a role in thee fantasies, most of the story is usually about the girl.The two roles that stole the show are those of the Baker and the Baker's wife ... righteously played by James Corden & Emily Blunt. No, they do not outshine Meryl or Daniel ... they match them perfectly! Not an easy task, especially when it comes to the likes of Meryl Streep ... but they were excellent in the roles, even though the writers went overboard and destroyed one of them completely! A very sick thing to do ... which shows the viewer why so many reviewers hated this film! One just must not ever mess with our heroes ... Americans can get quite mean and violent when you start tearing apart our childhood heroes! I once ended 13 year friendship over such a transgression ... and I do not regret it one bit! There are some things people must stand against, and there is plenty of it in this film! However, that does not mean that I will deny the fact that the actors did their jobs with perfection, and if there are people that cannot see that ... then those people are wrong! See the movie ... and make up your own mind.P.S. The musical number ""It's Your Fault!"" is perfection!",Into the Woods
186,MoviesReviews101,Verdict: Too Long,5,8 January 2015,"Story: Into the Woods starts by 'once upon a timing us' we have a small village on the edge of the woods where Cinderella (Kendrick) Jack (Huttlestone) and a childless Baker (Corden) along with his wife (Blunt) all live. Cinderella is left pushed around by her step sisters and mother making her do all the work. Jack is struggling with his mother to make ends meet and has to sale the only cow. The Baker and his wife let little Red Riding Hood (Crawford) head off into the woods to see granny. When the witch (Streep) from next door promises to lift the curse on The Baker's family that she had placed years before where she has taken the baby sister of the Baker. The Baker must go into the woods to retrieve certain items which will lead him to clash with all the characters who possess one of the items. We know all these characters from their fairy tales so we know the paths they should be taking and we follow The Baker as he falls into the stories to collect the items required. The Baker ends up becoming a catalyst to all of the stories to achieve the items as we continue to see the favourite characters and their fairy tale outcomes. Into the Woods really does try to squeeze as many different fairy tale characters into the story and for the first half of the film I will say it works well adding slight twists to the stories we all know and loved as children. Where the film goes in a bad direction is for the second half, where everything just seems to go in a downward spiral. I appreciate this could be a way to show how happy endings don't always happen but it really ended up coming off messy. We do have some terrible miss-casting too that hold the talented singers down. The film does jump between fairy tales too much and if you don't know the basic story you might end up feeling lost to the actual point in certain parts of the film. This ends up being a very messy musical that had potential to be something very good.

The Baker has to become the reluctant hero of the story. How did James Corden get a lead role in a film with such a talented cast? He really looks like a fish out of water here. (2/10)Emily Blunt: Baker's Wife who against her husband's orders follows him into the woods to help him retrieve the items before the deadline. Emily does a good job here showing she can play nearly any role in films now. (7/10)Meryl Streep: Witch who has put the curse on the Baker's family, she sets the couple a list to retrieve while keeping his unknown sister locked away from the world. Meryl gives a good performance but what would you expect from the best in the business.

Anna continues to make a name for herself in these musical performance and does a good job here. (7/10)Chris Pine: Prince Charming who is searching for Cinderella after she runs from the festival.

Daniel follows up his scene stealing performance in Les Miserable with another scene stealing performance here.

187,f-rabit,Will you guys just Shut Up?,3,21 March 2015,"This movie is very painful to the ears. They just don't (won't) shut up for a minute. The scenarios are cool and the characterization too. I kept on waiting to see if some real action happened and also if they would for some minute shut the hell up and start talking. But no, they just kept on singing like there's no tomorrow anymore. Had to switch it off...My ears were crying for help and they just: ""I wish.....I wish.... I wish....Into the woods....Into the woods.....Into the woods...""...bla bla bla.

188,ChristianLeFeuvre,Any Musicals fan will love this,9,27 October 2015,"I think it is true to say that when the name Stephen Sondheim is mentioned most people would think of his musicals 'A Little Night Music' or 'Sweeney Todd', or remember him as the lyricist for 'Gypsy' and the simply outstanding 'West Side Story'. Well, the great man has done many more and in 1987 one of his shows hit Broadway and hit the West End in 1990 (which I was actually lucky enough to work on). Winning multi Tony awards and Oliviers the show was 'Into The Woods'. The story intertwines various characters from fairy tales including, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel and Cinderella. These are all mixed in with an original story of a Baker and his Wife, their quest to start a family and reverse a curse put on them by the Witch. We've all heard the saying 'Be careful what you wish for...' well this show's main theme is wish fulfilment and its consequences. There is a generous mix of hope, heartache and humour in the show and it's certainly one of my personal favourites.Now this brilliant show has been given the big screen treatment, and what a movie.The production is outstanding and the cast superb. Directed by Rob Marshall (who also directed the movie version of the musical 'Chicago' winning it the Oscar for best picture), the film is an excellent adaptation from stage to screen.The whole cast were amazing. Meryl Streep is incredible as 'the Witch', Lilla Crawford plays the bratish 'Red Riding Hood', Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen are fantastic as the vain and egotistial Princes, James Corden as 'The Baker', Emily Blunt as 'The Baker's Wife' and Anna Kendrick as Cinderella play their parts so well with the right balance of emotion and light-heartedness. Daniel Huttlestone as Jack and Tracey Ullman as his mother were both terrific.I think the only 'niggles' I had were that a few of the songs from the show had been cut, which I never like happening anyway, and a couple of the ones they took out were, I think, needed.However, having said that the movie is excellent and well worth seeing.If you are a massive musicals fan like myself you will be definitely adding this movie to your DVD collection",Into the Woods
189,FallsDownz,"""Into the Woods is a fun with interesting message movie but it could be so much better""",6,18 January 2015,"First i have to say i haven't saw the Musical yet , so this is my experience from the film itself entirely.Into the Woods is a Musical movie directed by Rob Marshall the man behind some of great movie like Chicago in 2002 but he also directing some pretty bad movie like Nine in 2009 or The latest Pirates of the Caribbean : On Stranger Tides in 2011 so this movie is pretty much a coin flip between good and bad.And the result is between that , it's not a bad movie but it's not also good movie neither so let's start with the good stuff.First off the casting is really good all of the cast can actually sing which is really really really important in Musical movies and with Meryl Streep and also Emily Blunt stunning performance just makes the movie even better.Second , i liked how Rob Marshall directed the movie with his storytelling is pretty good and he directed the movement of characters really wellThird , i love the screenplay and message of the movie it is really interesting to use the fairy tale that original used to remind children of how dangerous the world is and turn that to the adult them self to tell them they are also affected by this dangerous world they create and they also have lust , greed or wish that sometimes even more dangerous than the kids does.Now come to the bad things , i think the direction of Singing scene can use more Long Take i think that will make the singing scene feels much more life and it will make the movie fells different from the Theater .next is the last 15 minutes of movie is just terrible it's makes the movie unmemorable with they just tell the message of the movie straight in our face and i don't know why they did that , it's like the director Rob Marshall scare so much that the audience wouldn't understand the message of the movie and solve that problem by show us straight in our face which ironically makes the message feels uninteresting instantly.but the thing that probably bother the fans of Theater version and me the most even though i haven't seen the Theater version is why they decided to cut the adult story part out, Into the Woods should be the movie or musical that taught adult not children then why cut the adult story out , my guess is because this movie owned by Disney and they trying so hard to make this movie PG and that adult content probably cannot allow in PG rating movie which is really disappointing consider the potential of this movie can be really really good but have to cut the heart out because they want to make it PG.Overall i still think that the movie itself is bad but it's not good neither if you enjoy the musical movie or even some mediocre fantasy movie you probably doing okay with this movie but if you expecting something more than that you probably end up disappointing.",Into the Woods
190,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Into the Woods Review,5,24 December 2014,"My Thoughts: First and foremost, this is a musical, people. I know there are some people that hate musicals, so I am giving you fair warning. I remember coming out of a screening of Rock of Ages and overhearing someone say ""I didn't know it was a musical!"" I just shook my head and kept walking.Second, if you are going to this movie and are expecting to see period-type garb, do not go–you will be disappointed. You ask me why I bring this up? I have friends that do look at the costumes that are worn by the actors and will critique them. I say this again because there are some costumes that are over-the-top, but this is based on fairy tales.I will come right out and say it: two-thirds of this movie is good, then we go come to the third act. I am serious when I say that there were people that got up and started walking out of the screening because they thought that the movie was over. There is a point in the movie that warps up everything nicely and ""happily ever after,"" and then it keeps going and gets darker, slower, and weaker. And all the time I kept thinking are we done yet?The best part of the movie? No, it wasn't Emily Blunt or Anna Kendrick, and that is very hard for me to say; people that know me will understand. But the best part is the scene with Cinderella's Prince (Chris Pine) and Rapunzel' Prince (Billy Magnussen) they have one song that I swear to god had the theater in stitches (Jen's note: it's ""Agony""); and their acting was just great. I think I could have watched that scene over and over. If you go see the movie you will know what I am talking about, and I hope you come back and let me know if I was right.And let me tell you this movie goes from musical, to fairy tale, to dark tale, to comedy, etc. I don't mind the darkness; many people don't know that the old fairy tales weren't all happily ever after.Also, I don't know what the budget was on this movie, but everyone seemed to be in it, and I mean everyone. I feel sorry for Lucy Punch; she seems to get typed cast as the evil step sister; I swear she was playing the same role in Ella Enchanted. Oh, Meryl Steep did an outstanding job as The Witch; if you need someone to play that evil, corrupted character, then you should cast her.I guess I should talk on the music in this since it is a musical. There are some great pieces in here that had me getting into the music, then there are pieces that just fall flat and you wish they would hurry it up and get over it.So, if I could just pay to go to the first two-thirds of this movie I would love it, but include the last third, and eh!My Recommendation: Catch a matinée.",Into the Woods
191,uroshnor54,It Was Okay,5,3 January 2015,"I went to Into the Woods with pretty low expectations. I've never seen or read the play and all I knew about it was that it had something to do with fairy tales. If the movie had ended with the birth of The Baker and The Baker's Wife's son and Cinderella's marriage, I would have given it a 6 or maybe even a 7 but I didn't like the end. I don't think The Baker's Wife should have died. Actually, no, let me rephrase that. I think it would have been alright for her to die if the film had established a dark tone. But it was quite lighthearted until then so her death really came out of nowhere. I did find most of the movie to be mildly entertaining, though. I did like how the fairy tales were connected and the actors were all good.",Into the Woods
192,Foux_du_Fafa,"Please don't expect a nice, cuddly fairy tale from Disney",8,14 March 2015,"First of all, this is not a Disney film and should not be viewed as such, at least in the traditional sense. Yes, it was released and produced by the Walt Disney Company, but I think people seem to be forgetting or are unaware that this is an adaptation of a late 80s Broadway musical by Sondheim and not something developed in-house at Disney. Comparing it to any of Disney's animated films (or more recently its live-action remakes of animated films) is perhaps a bit unfair. Moreover, the original stage production was not trying to follow the Disney fairy tale formula. The original Grimm tales, while diverse in range and tone given their number, are generally quite sombre stories. In a way, they are reflections of the world we live in, as brutal as it may be at times. Moreover, many tales from the Grimm collection, and other folk traditions (such as ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" and ""Puss in Boots""), have morally ambiguous protagonists. Was simply being poor or potentially being eaten that good an excuse for Jack to steal from a giant? After decades of Disneyfication, the plot of ""Into the Woods"" essentially takes the originals in their rustic, plague-ridden glory and adds a second act, probably intentionally written for this generation, reminding us to be careful of wishes, decadence and ambition getting the better of us. This take on the fairy tale may not be to everyone's liking, just as how some people may not enjoy the classic Disney formula or the practice of turning fairy tales into action movies. What is important is to not confusing the purpose of this film with the purpose of ""Frozen"", ""Maleficent"" or many other recent fairy tale films.As for myself, I really enjoyed ""Into the Woods"". I hadn't been too familiar with the original stage production so I didn't have high expectations in that regard. In any case, I loved the music and the script. The cast was very good, and the costumes and sets were enchanting (for the critics of Johnny Depp's wolf: use your imagination); overall they caught the spirit of enchantment and the hardship of pre-industrial Europe so present in many classic fairy tales so well. Seeing the Grimms' version of ""Cinderella"" on screen as opposed to the Perrault/Disney model was also a refreshing change. The infamous final act is admittedly a bit slow but ends on a poignant note.",Into the Woods

Not even close to ""Sweeney Todd,"" not that that was perfect. I think a high school student--no, an elementary school student--could have written better songs. I hated almost all of the characters.

I've never seen a staged production or read the script. But I left feeling like the director never pulled it all together. It felt scattered and unfocused without a clear concept of what it all meant. Streep and Blunt were great. Depp was, for me, worse than usual. For those of you who have witnessed more focused stage productions, perhaps you benefited from other director's visions. I realize the story itself is busy and tries accomplish a lot with many different classic stories and characters, but the job then is to make it all work.

After seeing the commercials, sneak peeks and behind the scenes shorts I was expecting a movie more in line with the typical Disney fare; a scene providing some information and maybe a story point or two then a song (i.e. Toy Story, High School Musical, etc.). ""Into the woods"" is more in line with a traditional Opera where every line is done in song. The actress playing Red Riding Hood does a terrific job with her part of the song ""Into the woods,"" you can hear a part of it in the commercials. There is only about 10 minutes of spoken dialogue in the entire movie.Bottom line is if you do not like the opera production format wait for this movie to come to Netflix (or however you rent movies) so you don't feel so bad about spending so much money if you can't sit through the entire movie.",Into the Woods
199,agblum,"Charming, Funny and Great Music!",9,30 December 2014,"""Into the Woods"" is the movie adaption by Disney, of the Broadway musical by Stephen Sondheim, that mixes characters from different well- known Grimm Brother's fairy tales including ""Cinderella"", ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and ""Rapunzel"", in a plot where a childless couple, - A Baker, played by James Cordan, and his wife, played by Emily Blunt, want to end a curse, placed by a vengeful witch, played by Meryl Streep . Also Included in the cast are other well know actors and actresses, including Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, Chris Pine as Cinderella's Prince, Johnny Depp as The Wolf, Tracey Ullman as the Mother of Jack, of Jack and the Beanstalk, and Christine Baranksi as Cinderella's Stepmother. For fans of the original play – It was reported ahead of time, and approved by Sondheim - Disney did make some plot changes to make the film more family friendly. As I am not familiar with the original show, and I could not judge it against that, and would try to do it apart from the show anyway. What I did see was a charming, and at times funny movie, with great music. The 2nd half does get a good deal dark, changing the tone of the first half. If you understand the point the story is trying to make, you accept the tone change. The whole cast, known and not well known, can all sing. In the end, I enjoyed it very much, and it's a good movie for taking a whole family to see (It is Rated PG for thematic elements, fantasy action and peril, and some suggestive material.). 3 ½ out of 4 Stars, 9 out of 10.",Into the Woods
200,interestingfunstuff,PG Rating Is A Scam! This Movie Is Not Suitable For Children/Pre-Teens Unless You Want To Destroy Your Children's Innocence!,1,28 December 2014,"Into The Woods is a sick, twisted story that is beyond bad or rotten. It tells that audience that unless you are a newborn baby everyone - no matter what your age or social class - is corrupt and despicable! (If you want to see a fantasy film that is the best I've ever seen in my life then buy Hallmark's & Jim Henson's ""Jack and the Beanstalk - The Real Story."" It is suitable for all ages and you may even cry your brains out while watching it the first time, like I did!)I've never before seen a movie that should have been rated PG-13 or R rated PG. Never in my life - and I have been going to movies for at least 45 YEARS! Let me ask you this: Is three separate acts of thievery of an innocent individual's most valuable possessions - that leads to an act of manslaughter by a child, no less, worthy of only a PG rating? Then add another act of manslaughter, with the assistance of all the adults around him worthy of just a PG rating? Then another act of manslaughter by an adult killing the child's mother worthy of just a PG rating? Then the accidental death of another adult hero worthy of just a PG rating? How about leaving a new born child with a pre-teen with zero babysitting experience, as if that was not a big deal, worthy of just a PG rating. How about a kidnapper isolating her alleged daughter first in a castle with no escape, then in a rather flimsy hut made of twigs - in a swamp in the middle of nowhere - worthy of just a PG rating? How about one of the characters that was murdered looking exactly like an elderly grandmother is that worthy of only a PG rating? Or how about a flock of birds pecking out the eyes of two women is that worthy of only a PG rating? In the world of ""Into the Woods"" blindness is funny! How sick and twisted can you get? How about a totally innocent man having his eyes poked out by thorn bushes, is that worthy of only a PG rating. (Does it really matter if he is innocent or or not, this film was rated PG!) And last, but not least, let's not forget one women having their toe cut off and another having there heel of their foot cut off? Wow! I've never seen acts amputation to be hilarious until now (I'm being sarcastic!) Is that worthy of only a PG rating? This Film Is So Bad It Is Making Me Feel Nauseous! I may even throw-up by the end of the night! Most people have better things to do then write a movie review when they feel this sick to their stomach. But if I help prevent one young person or adult from seeing this film and being deceived and traumatized, like I was, then it's well worth the effort.I want to make it clear there are NO good guys in this film. I could care less about any of the characters except for the newborn child and the two murdered giants. Whoever had anything to do with this film knew exactly what they were doing. If adults want to see sick and twisted be my guest! But to market this as a movie suitable for children and then to have the film's rating gamed in order to maximize profits is an act of evil, plain and simple! Sorry, but I call a spade a spade. What I would like to really say will be censored, so let your imagination run wild! On the subject of maximizing profits: Ticket sales are considerably down from last year and you wonder why? I was looking forward to seeing two other movies. Now I'm not going to see them! Hollywood and movie theater owners you made $11.50 off of me! Now you're going to loose because you would have made $34.50 had you not gamed the rating. I don't care in slightest how good the other films might be. I'll wait till I can buy them for a PENNY on Amazon! Now multiply that by lots of people across the world and I don't care how palatial you build your new movie theaters - I have zero interest in stepping inside! Zero! Zero! Zero! Antagonizing your loyal customers by trying to boost your quarterly statement at the expense of your annual statement is dumb, dumb, dumb! Hasn't anyone in Hollywood taken Accounting 101?

REALLY?""""The opening number is just too repetitive and strange!"":: sigh ::This is what happens when you give an audience something wonderful to think about while they're watching, and all they want is simple-minded fairy tales doled out with a large spoon.OK, note to audience: INTO THE WOODS is a damn sight closer to the original tales than you probably know. In the oriignal Grimm tales, Cinderella's family not only goes through the hacking and cutting and blinding, but also has to dance in red hot iron shoes at her wedding until they're dead. Little Red Riding Hood and her granny are not saved by a passing huntsman. These tales are filled with death and destruction, all as warnings not to steer too far from the path... so if all you know is the Disney versions, then I suggest you go read up a bit on the originals before seeing this.The score is a complex piece of work: if you listen carefully (I know, listening is *hard*, to paraphrase Barbie), you'll hear echoes of songs played against each other throughout the film. They way that it's done is brilliant and wondrous, because it adds another layer of meaning to everything by having characters ""speak"" to each other without actually talking to each other. For all the one-star reviews of this, all I can figure is that all Americans want to see is stuff blowing up and girls with big tits, and sadly for you, you wont find a lot of that in INTO THE WOODS. It's challenging, gorgeous material, beautifully mounted, impeccably scored. Yes, they did some disservice to the original show, especially in the second act, but most of the changes are still well-founded. Rapunzel (SPOILER) running off with her prince echoes back to the central theme of the show: children don't listen. Apparently, neither do adults.",Into the Woods

The plot was garbage, the characters were unlikable, and so much that happened in it was pointless. Really, a sudden disastrous problem would suddenly arise, only to literally be solves less than a minutes later, making it utterly pointless to have been put in the movie at all. Everything that happens simply happens purely out of convenience just to move the plot along. And while it was interesting the way they tried to combine different fairy tales together, it was done very poorly. The only ""redeemable"" thing about this movie were certain somewhat decent songs, though many of which were simply lines that could have easily been spoken but they chose to sing them for some reason. Really, only one moment stood out as good in my eyes, and that was the message about blaming the witch in the song ""The Last Midnight"". Everything else was poorly done, plot convenient garbage.

This is not the quality of what we all have come to expect from a Disney movie. That said, or written, we have known that Disney does dabble in the 'darker' aspects of classics. Reference the recently released, non-animated version of Cinderella. But, still, this musical version of Grimm would make the brothers roll in their collective graves. Absolutely abysmally horrible. Emily Blunt, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" brought her into this abyss with Streep. Anna Kendrick, of ""Pitch Perfect"" fame, Johnny Depp, who is forever betrothed to Disney for the POTC films, and Tracy Ullmann are all collateral damage at this point. Everything is missing from this Disney offering. Gone with the cleverly written dialogue. Absent is the magical Disney Alan Menkin songs. None of it. All that it took was the time it took to view.

205,gjw,Too dark,3,30 April 2015,"I love Broadway musicals in general, but I had avoided this one on stage because I had heard enough about it to know that it twisted well-loved fairy tales in a dark, cynical manner, with a tragic third act, and tragedy simply doesn't appeal to me.For that matter, neither does Steven Sondheim's music, which (with a few notable exceptions) tends to be much too talky for its own good, prancing about like some medieval balladeer trying to be clever, and putting its own pretentiousness ahead of solid melodies.I avoided the movie in theaters for the same reasons, but once it was available on Netflix for rent, I couldn't resist taking a look at it, in case I had made a mistake staying away from it. I hadn't. It is definitely not my cup of tea.But I feel even sorrier for the usual Disney audiences who made the mistake of going to this film unawares.Disney, of all studios, should know better than to take a dark, tragic spin on fairy tales, aimed at ""sophisticated"" adult audiences, full of death and sad misfortune, and serve it up as a musical with a PG rating under the Disney label. It's obvious that would attract the typical Disney audience of parents with children, who would expect the usual Disney sunshine and instead wind up with this dark mix of pedophile wolves, dying princesses and adulterous spouses. A surefire formula for massive disappointment. They should have let some other studio handle it, or at least released it under a different label, with a warning that it wasn't meant for kids.",Into the Woods

An interesting combination and interpretation of certain fairy tail elements and one is never quite sure what comes next. As has been stated in other reviews, Johnny Depp's character could be seen/portrayed in a negative way along with some other dark and unexpected comments. Personally, I like the dark stuff but I would not recommend this film for under 14. Aside from Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep, I did enjoy Emily Blunt's character as well as Anna Kendrick.

I was in a group, and unsure how the rest felt about it, otherwise I would have left long before it was over.I went in with a positive attitude, and was somewhat intrigued with the first 20 minutes or so. But the film just settles into a grinding repetitiveness and lack of depth that quickly sucks the life from the viewer.All the characters are one-dimensional and impossible to sympathize or identify with, the ""story"" is drawn out and boring, and the music all has a certain mediocre sameness that blends together into nothing more than an annoying sort of white noise. Here I sit a few days later, and I cannot remember anything specific...lyrics or melody....from any song in the movie. And I would estimate that 2/3 of this film was singing...which is a lot....even for a ""musical"".And all of the above just goes on and on and on. After about the 75 minute mark I felt myself mildly panicking because I could not see how the story was going to come to an end (and didn't care) but just wanted out! It really, truly, is that bad....and is very long to boot.I hope by now word is out about this film and people are avoiding it in droves.

208,gogarrett,"A musical, a tragedy, a comedy all rolled into one",7,28 December 2014,"I came eagerly to the theater to see this intriguing cast in a movie together and wondered how all these fairy tales would be woven together. I had forgotten this movie is an adapted stage musical, yet I enjoy that style of performance. I thought the music was very good throughout, especially the songs performed by Meryl Streep and the two children who all sang well and appropriately ""over the top"". The two princes singing their duet on the waterfall cracked everybody up. It was so unexpectedly hysterical. It made me wish the whole movie was like that, but it wasn't. Much of the story was very troubled and dark and very uneven in tone. The story had the thread running through of the witch's bargain with the baker and his wife, and it made sense for all of the fairy tale stories to run next to their's, yet something seemed to be missing or not right about it all and the part involving Rapunzel was somewhat boring. After the witch's sudden departure more stories erupted, so the thread was lost and scattered and then brought back to a rather strange end where a sense of extreme loss for every character would be more natural than the tender bonding by a bunch of unrelated characters which took place rather too quickly. Examining the uneven qualities, in part it seemed because of a Cinderella who was so conflicted and serious, and yet had the magic of talking to and commanding birds? The Baker and his wife were mostly serious and nothing bizarre about them other than having a blue-haired witch for a neighbor. The stepmother, step sisters and the princes never seemed very serious as real characters even when horribly blinded or having a toe or heel cut off! I guess fairy tales are bizarre and can be ghastly as well, in which case this fairy tale was no different. Scariest characters for me: The Wolf and Prince Charming (both as lechers in the woods). Funniest characters: The two princes while singing together and chasing their damsels, and Red Riding Hood. Best at emotional pull: The Witch, The Baker, Jack. I wasn't feeling as much as I should have for Cinderella or the Baker's wife, but I really wanted to. Overall this was good entertainment, but it defies my understanding of a tragedy or comedy. I am not used to so much of both elements in one story. Certainly it fared well as a musical, however not with tunes that stuck in my head after leaving the theater.",Into the Woods

Production- wise.....yeah, it's really not that good. But, story-wise...God, so much F@#$%'n SINGING!!!!! And I actually think that the soundtrack did this play more justice than this god-awful movie did. I mean, two hours of absolute nothingness, but our two main leads acting like idiots and and second act that went absolutely nowhere, but just wasted my time.

211,jgeorge4,A random pile of junk,3,28 December 2014,"I gave my family a Christmas gift this year. It is a board game called ""A Winter's Tale."" We haven't even had a chance to take it out of the box yet, but the premise, as I understand it, is each player has the opportunity to ""redirect"" a fairy tale by injecting their own plot twists and character twists.Why am I telling you this? Because if I played the game with a half dozen 1st graders, I strongly suspect the end result wouldn't be any worse than the ""Into the Woods"" screenplay. For example: COMPLETE AND TOTAL SPOILERS AHEAD (OR MAYBE NOT)Ooh ooh....then the evil witch is really Rapunzel's step-mother...but then the prince is really a bad guy who doesn't really love Cinderella...ooh! ooh! then the witch loses all her magic! but first she brings the cow back to life...then little red riding hood dares Jack to steal a golden harp for her...but then the baker's wife dies but he doesn't seem all that upset about it...ooh, but first she cheats on him with Cinderella's prince! ooh! I know I know! Then Cinderella's bird friends blind her evil stepsisters....then the giant's wife comes down and is really mad...."" In the end it is a crying shame this movie is so lousy. Consider: 1. The cast and the acting are terrific 2. The first half of the movie was often clever and engaging. The second half just dragged on and on and on 3. Americans just can't get enough of these ""re-imagined fairy tales"" these days.Ultimately, however, it was just way too long, way too random and just way too uninteresting.If you must go see it, ask if you can leave halfway through and pay half price.",Into the Woods

I'm writing this review as a lay-person and to make sense to the average movie goer.The music is very upbeat - especially the first song - I wish. Its awesome. Very danceable.Its a nice mash up of popular Grimm's Fairy tales - Jack & the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel and Cinderella.The movie is also in part inspired by the animated movies from Pixar and Disney - Tangled (Rapunzel), the Shrek Series and their take on the fairy tales interwoven - especially - the twist in the Prince Charming story - similar to a similar approach in Frozen. Same approach in this movie. Ironically the Prince Charming Character is played by Chris Pine - who plays the Womanizer Captain Kirk character on Star Trek - very similar to his Character in this movie.The only element that is not explained well is the disappearance of the Baker's wife in the end of the movie. Apparently the magic forest is similar to the Jungle in LOST - who has a mind of its own and can generate people to mess with people.The is extremely entertaining. I'd see this movie more than once in the cinemas - even on imax or 3D and would definitely own the Blu Ray and buy the OST.",Into the Woods
213,taylor_king-890-815491,"Mis-Produced, Mis-Cast, Mis-Written, Miss It!",3,25 December 2014,"This is not a movie, it's a musical! I love musicals when they showcase memorable, well- written songs with strong vocal performances by talented singers. The major problem with ""Into the Woods"" is it has neither! I would call the Sondheim score more ""ditties"" than songs, they are long and un-melodic, and they all sound like the same ""ditty"". Most musicals I've seen have a spoken script that breaks up the singing, but this is non-stop singing from start to finish by actors who are not even average singers...not one would make it through auditions for ""The Voice""! My eyes started to close after the first few scenes when I realized what we were in for. Scenes are almost all shot in the same setting - the dark woods - so no matter when I woke up, I was looking at pretty much the same thing. Acting-wise, Chris Pine as the Prince is the only actor who was able to escape from the role constrictions because his was the only truly humorous character. His song ""Agony"" was cute, but not worth the price of admission. James Corden as the Baker gets to show some heart and as Baker's wife, Emily Blunt is sadly miscast and cannot sing. The two kids who play Little Red Ridinghood and Jack (from the ""Beanstalk"") need more vocal coaching, and Meryl Streep as the Witch never finds her voice, despite trying many different ones to perform her vocals. On any day, especially Christmas Day, we deserve better, Hollywood!",Into the Woods
214,LivBrumei,Dark messages dressed as fairy tale,6,29 January 2015,"I can see that there are many hateful reviews regarding this movie. I really didn't like it that much. I guess every time we hear about a movie with a parade of movie stars, and not just movie stars but very talented people for me (Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, Johnny Depp, etc.) we get our expectations very high and the most usual is that the movie doesn't fulfill them. For me that's what happens here. I started hearing about Into the woods about a year ago and several teasers were released during this time. It makes some point, they want to sell their movie good. In the meanwhile too many people wonder about it and start expecting this will be one of ""The"" movies this year. It isn't! Despite this I don't find it the worse movie or even close! It's not amazing. It's not entirely surprising. But there is something really good about it and makes it different from the usual fairy tale stories that I'm used to. The characters and their stories are more similar to the common human beings and there are some really dark messages in some parts of the movie, regarding Little Red Riding Hood, for example. I think if we pay attention we can see how the story that we are so used to since we were kids can have this warning message for little girls. So Into the Woods will be different and will surprise you on those therms. This part I think it's quite worth the movie. Don't set expectations to high and you may even really enjoy the movie. But it certainly wouldn't deserve to have won the Golden Globe for lacking a stronger story.",Into the Woods
215,AkelaLoneWolf,Pointless tale with confusing perspectives,5,22 January 2015,"Disney has overdone it with adult adaptations of familiar fairy tales this time. This was neither fit for children nor adults; the former would have found the immoral and improper behavior of all their favorite main protagonists disconcerting and the latter were too old for morals, even less so when they were sung. Presentation in musical form was not this film's cardinal sin, rather the blurred morality and perspectives. I sat through the witch with mother issues and parenting control problems, the indecisive Cinderella with a severe inferiority complex (who would want to wear a blood-soaked golden slipper after her sisters mangled their feet for the fitting by the way?), the couple of kleptomanic kids, a baker with absent father issues, the narcissistic chest-baring duet by the princes was even a bit funny - all that and still I would have rated this movie higher if it had ended at the ""happily ever after"" spot. But no, the playwright had to ruin it by adding the philandering prince's encounter with the flighty baker's wife (what was that for anyway?!) and the unrealistic concerted efforts in killing a wronged giantess by the ""survivors"". Completely superfluous and dragged on the story way too long. If you ask me, apologies with forgiveness were overdue to the poor giants and that should have been the proper ending - now that's a proper moral for this confusing tale. Well the attempt at interweaving old stories was heroic, though the outcome was disastrous.",Into the Woods

Although, most of the members of the cast did a good job but Meryl Streep stands out as the highlight of this movie. Rob Marshall, no stranger to musicals had done a good directing of this movie too.What i didn't like was that, it was somehow rushed in which it didn't pay some honor to its source material in which the tone is problematic (it somehow light), plus the rape and adultery stuff is making this movie anxious and flabbergasted to viewers.Still, the good thing that Into the Woods has redeemable qualities, such as the costume and production designs as well Stephen Sondheim's musical score. At least it's epic but with muddled flaws.",Into the Woods
217,endymion82,"Disturbing, Unsettling, Subversive, Compassionate, Intelligent, Beautiful",10,25 January 2015,"This movie isn't for everyone. The show isn't either. That's exactly why it's good.One star for Disney having the guts to make a film of the show that challenges and inverts what Disney built its career on- sanitizing the common mythology of folktales and fairy tales. The anger with which people react to Disney having made this film is proof of why we needed it and they needed to do it. One star for the costumes, a hodgepodge of sly references to the various European time periods and settings each of these tales comes from. One star for the woods themselves. Haunting, beautiful, menacing, and so very real. One star for the ensemble- probably the best assembled for a musical film since CHICAGO. Everyone can sing and sings well, more importantly they can all act, and act while they sing, which is essential for Sondheim. One star for Anna Kendrick- she knocks her big song out of the park. Cinderella is the hardest character in the story- indecisive, sad, alienated, but so intelligent, so hopeful, so optimistic in spite of the abandonment, the beatings, the humiliation and ultimately even the betrayal of her fantasies- and Kendrick hits every beat perfectly, moving from girl to woman, from someone who can barely express what she wants to someone who tells her prince its over when she realizes she loves a man she doesn't actually know. One star for Emily Blunt- so smart, so adept at crafting a character in broad and tiny strokes. The Baker's Wife is the jewel in the crown of a play/movie featuring an embarrassment of excellent and complex women's roles and Blunt carries the morally ambiguous but staunchly optimistic message of the movie beautifully. She's simultaneously charming, funny, tragic and human. One star for James Corden- the best Baker I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. He is the heart of the movie. His journey is profound. He's believable at every step and he, of everybody, made this character entirely his own. One star for Stephen Sondheim- one of America's finest songwriters. The early songs are complex sung monologues of lyrical gymnastics, characters explaining their thinking, their motives, their discoveries in the deceptively simple manner of fairy tales, but as the story deepens the simple, sing-song melodies are replaced by richer, deeper, darker music, till we finally get the screaming wail of LAST MIDNIGHT and then the melancholy lullaby of NO ONE IS ALONE. It's brilliant, beautifully constructed, and eschews mainstream sound while still creating one of the richest harmonic pallets in any movie musical ever. And you have to listen to it more than once to truly get it- and that's okay. One star for James Lapine, for finding a way to condense his stage play and reinvent it for a new millennium, for adhering to the moral ambiguity of the world he created and not compromising on that front. One star for Rob Marshall, for opening his film with a shot of the sky, and closing it with the same, before the reprise of the prologue, with the last notes of CHILDREN WILL LISTEN playing themselves out. To have the guts to make a movie that tells the truth- that all of our lives are the space between Giant attacks brought on by the wishes of humans who can't see the long term consequences of their actions- is pretty commendable. We're a country so scared of the truth right now, and the moral of INTO THE WOODS is that fantasy has its place, as a coping mechanism, but the imagination always has been and always will be a double-edged sword. ""I wish"" is a powerful statement, and the spark of life (the Greeks knew this- and that's why the universe begins with the birth of Desire) but it's also the beginning of a long road that leads deeper and deeper into the woods- even when you think it leads out. And sure, you can see this as bleak, or you can see this as a rallying cry to be courageous and recognize life for what it is- brutal and hard, but graced with moments where you win or come to truly understand something, and where you are never alone because we're all going through it together. This movie is absolutely suitable for children. I saw the show- which is much more violent and sexual- when I was 10. Best thing that ever happened to me, taught me how to live in the real world and care about other human beings and be a part of a community. Partly because I had parents who talked to me about the show I saw afterward. So yes, this movie is completely suitable for children- you just have to be the kind of parent who uses film to engage your child's mind, not shut them up for two hours with harmless drivel.",Into the Woods

This is a movie without a point, a wandering post-modern walkabout in the land of dramatic entropy. No, I did not mean irony, I meant entropy. The movie runs downhill and out of energy like the Heat Death of the universe predicted by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, only you don't have to wait eons of time to witness this entropic death, you get to see it after you have wasted about two hours of your time. The singing is awful, to boot. Truly cringe-worthy. Now I can finally sympathize with my kill-joy father.

For all those who are complaining that this is 'not a PG', they have obviously never read the Grimm et al original tales. Fairy tales have a lot of violence in them, there are sexual undertones and massive plot holes. In at least this way, the film was fine (yes, that is what happened to Cinderella's sisters in the original tale!). Even the actors tried their best. The problem with this film is the really badly written music and the fact that there are too many songs and not enough dialogue. Considering it is a musical, I would assume they may have worked more on that aspect. This is the kind of film that should've been great. And would've been great with better songs. What a disappointment. I can see children getting very bored with this as the music is so mundane and all sounds the same.

Since Into the Woods is a singing movie they stated the obvious continuously throughout the movie. The simple story was shoved down my throat in ever singing segment, telling me things I already knew. The story wasn't compelling and most of the characters were underdeveloped so I never felt connected to them. Not to mention there were side stories that ended abruptly,The movie also ran WAY longer than it needed to. A 2 hour runtime for a singing movie. The movie could have been done in an hour and a half. This runtime made things slow and boring in segments waiting for something to happen.There were 2 good singing segments, other than that they aren't good. There was also some cringeworthy singing by some characters (especially Meryl Streep). For a movie that is all singing, this isn't good.There were a couple good shots in the movie, but nothing that really blew me away. It was all pretty generic camera movements with branches being the foreground, and trees being the background in everything.The movie wasn't good. I'm not a fan of singing movies, so that's why it's marking really low. Not being a fan of the genre and all the problems with it added up to a low score. Anna Kendrick was one of the most interesting characters and she wan't even the main one. She sang the best and was more eye catching. Everybody else was just there.

221,NBates1,Meh...,4,11 January 2015,"The film has its positives and negatives. It has a talented cast, a rather interesting premise, some of the songs were enjoyable and it has impressive 'stage-like' visuals. However, the film is at times confusing and quickly shifts from one storyline to the next. Also, it got annoying that actual dialogue was continuously interrupted by a song (even if they were good). It really got tiresome in the end. Also, the characters were not *that* likable, a lot of them were unlikeable, and for me, the best character was Emily Blunt's, who had a certain warmth. I do not think it is recommended for young kids, as it has some disturbing moments (Cinderella's stepsisters having their toes cut and blinded by the crows, many characters dying), and not for adults as it has a lot of cheesy moments. I did not enjoy Meryl Streep's performance as the witch because her singing voice isn't that good and her character was not that interesting. By the end, the film was tedious.

Visually it was interesting and the way the story lines interwove was nice. It was a tad too long, the slaying of the giant a bit drawn out. I never imagined that I would like a story told in song, but why not? This wasn't a purely children's fairy tale and some of the scenes were for oldies.

If you have to ask the question I asked when I left the theater today, ""Just what are you trying to say?"" then you haven't told the story well. For all the fine music and excellent performances in ""Into the Woods"", they failed as storytellers.First, I am not the traveler and sophisticate many of my friends are, sadly. I have never seen ""Into the Woods"" on stage. If I had, maybe my reaction to the movie would have been different.Second, I LOVE Stephen Sondheim. There is something about his music that never fails to transport me. Well, almost never.Third, Meryl Streep is the greatest. One of my favorite jokes ends, ""Are you kidding? If they cast Meryl Streep as Batman it would be perfect casting!"" I agree. So I went to the theater expecting brilliance. I expected to be transported. Anything less was going to be a disappointment.Very quickly I was asking myself if Sondheim hadn't phoned it in musically. Don't get me wrong: when SONDHEIM phones it in, it's still better than 99.9% could do at their very best. But I kept waiting for it to get brilliant. It never did.Maybe I was expecting too much. I saw ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" after seeing ""Driving Miss Daisy"" and left disappointed. Years later when I saw ""Tomatoes"" without having seen ""Miss Daisy"" in such close proximity, I found I loved ""Tomatoes"" on its own.Maybe if I go back and see ""Into the Woods"" a second time, I'll like it better. But this time I left confused.One of the greatest and most important rules about storytelling is ""Never pass up a good opportunity to shut up."" It is one of the most important rules for preaching.""Into the Woods"" tries to weave together ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", ""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""Cinderella"", ""Rapunzel"", and another about a baker and his wife who can have no children. They do this fairly well. And that was when I thought the movie was over.And that was when the movie, I began to suspect, really began, or was supposed to. It became apparent that all the Good Guys had lied, stolen, schemed, and basically done anything they thought they could get away with to get what they wanted. Jack's giant realized he had been robbed, and simply came to reclaim his stolen property. Jack killed him. The giant's wife came to avenge her husband. Red Riding Hood mused that killing people is wrong, and even a giant is a person. Then they killed the giantess, and nobody ever looked back, in regret or any other way.There were hints of moral complexity, deep ethical questions, but only hints. If they were trying to make any point at all, I missed it. There are two possibilities: I am obtuse (not impossible), or they told their story badly.To my friends who trust my opinion, I say to go see the movie. See it for the spectacle, for the amazing performances by an amazing cast. Meryl is, well, Meryl. When has Tracey Ullman ever missed? Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen are hilarious as the princes. James Cordon (the Baker) was a new one for me, one I'll be looking for again! Anna Kendrick is a delight. Emily Blunt sparkled. And they had Christine Baranski! She is the whole package, perfectly capable of doing it all, and she did it magnificently.Sondheim's music and lyrics are delightful, even if they weren't as breathtaking as I expected. Well worth the price of admission.But in the end, I think they storytellers let us all down. I ask them again, ""Just what were you trying to say?"" If your audience leaves still asking that question, how can you have succeeded in telling your story?",Into the Woods

Not so much Cindy - although here my Son loved that they kept the original German version and really gave it to he step sisters, except then the writers had their spin and gave the 'WOODS' an unwanted Las Vegas feel (and song) just to really kill of any men watching this movie. Loved see Tracey Ullman! And the weaving of the 4 tales was nicely done. The wolf was interesting, weird, but well done. (many times movie felt like scenes from the play; which this whole is from, movies flow differently.) I think the children behind me liked this movie - it felt that many would have clapped as sometimes happens but no one started so it was quiet. Not a movie for the weak of musical heart. A great twist for me was that the Princes are brothers. That fit nicely and made for a funny song, sight gag, bit as 2 brothers can provide.So woof stinker, but amazing bits, woven nicely.

The acting is great, not a single member of the cast fails. Meryl Streep is superb as the witch. Anna Kendrick is a bit miscast to be honest. She is just too modern and adult to play cinders really. But she does a magnificent job despite being forced to sing outside her normal register. She's a trouper and pulls it off. Negatives? The direction. The artistic choices. From what I've read, the second act should be much darker and a lot of it was simply cut, including several of the best songs. This explains why the ending feels weird. They tried to sanitize it. Well that's just destroying the whole meaning of the play. Stupid decision. Also, I would have liked to see a little more of the fantasy worlds evoked but never shown. The mysterious 'festival', the giants domain, the giant himself perhaps. Plus I don't see why it has to so dark and gritty. A bit of delightful forest would have counterbalanced the dark scary forest. But I enjoyed it and will see it again, to listen to the music.",Into the Woods
230,AustinOswald,Charming....Prince Charming?,8,26 December 2014,"""Into the Woods"" was an amazing movie with an all-star cast. Beginning the story was Anna Kendrick as the gorgeous Cinderella. Although they never say her name, she is one of the most crucial characters in this movie and whoever casted her was a genius. She was the epitome of talent. Her voice, acting ability, and pure charm brought such life to the movie and made it very enjoyable. That being said, the entire cast was brilliant including the creepy, yet likable, Meryl Streep, Chris Pine, Emily Blunt, James Corden, Daniel Huttlestone, and even Johnny Depp, who has a very minor part. The sets were gorgeous and the CGI was stunning and very believable, even for a fantasy world. However, the main pull of this movie was the music. Beautiful and upbeat, Stephen Sondheim and the cast did an unbelievably great job with the score. The story, to me, was a little flat, but still very well written. I didn't feel the audience received the intended emotions because the story jumped around a lot. It told the stories of many different characters simultaneously which made it a little hard to follow. Other than that, the story was just the right amount of action, romance, and suspense.

232,madpigmadpig,A total waste,1,4 July 2018,"A total waste. No real songs, glossed over/abbreviated stories, more so-so acting than should be in a major production, and unimaginative art direction/costumes. It's supposed to be a musical, but there aren't really any songs. It's almost entirely just sing-songy dialogue that happens to have random bits of music flitting around behind it. The fairytales either need to be ""fractured"" for silliness or delivered faithfully. Not just muddled for convenience-sake like this. Worst of all, no progression. Most of the way through, the husband and wife characters do a whole speech/song about how the husband's character has changed, but it hasn't. There aren't any character arcs at all by that point in the movie. Oh, and the acting. Red Riding Hood is too old, too loud, and really obnoxious. The two princes seemed very hard to believe as heterosexuals, especially during their big duet. The husband/wife seemed like a modern suburban couple (of green actors). The entire set design is dark blue/green. What's the point of having a production design budget if there's nothing to look at? And who designed Depp's Big Bad Wolf costume, or lack thereof? Not only is that lazy, but it also makes the scene seem more like a weird old man hitting on a young girl than like an animal wanting to consume her. Wrong kind of creepy, guys. Finally, I'm generally annoyed at Disney's new self-flagellating trend to appease classic-fairytale-Disneyfying haters. Once Upon a Time and other such TV shows were bad enough as examples of ironically anti-Disney products. The original versions of the fairytales that Disney adapted in the past were horrific, and I was glad to see them cleaned up and made kid-friendly. Heck, civilized-society friendly. This movie is an example of backsliding. Disney needs to stop the self-hate and embrace its tradition as a positive shaper of our modern mythology. In short, skip this movie. It's abject cultural flotsam.",Into the Woods
233,koralrosecancion,They totally missed the moral of the story,6,8 January 2020,"I remember waiting for this movie to come out. I'd grown up listening to Bernadette Peters. Performed lesser characters myself until I finally got to be the Witch. This movie had an all star cast and I was so excited.End credits roll, and I sat there more angry than sad. A musical with so many moral lessons and all the movie can focus on is KILLING the Giant as the big finale. The whole movie ends with Children Will Listen and all I can think of is the kids who just learned that it is ok to kill to get what you want.Yes the Giant dies in the musical but because of the limitations of stage the scene is less about getting that giant but focuses on the people struggling to survive against giant odds. Also, the true finale of the musical has a wonderful lesson that is completely cut out the movie. ...There is one last reprise of the theme ""Into the woods"" One verse says, ""... Into the woods but not to stray or tempt the wolf or steal from the giant."" Because, let's face it, the giant is the most innocent party in the whole play. She was kind to the thieving, murderous boy, Jack.""Into the woods, each time you go There's more to learn of what you know. ..Into the woods to mind the wolf, to Heed the witch, to Honor the giant. .... into the woods. Then out of the woods -- and happily ever after!"" Then Cinderella says, ""I wish..."" and everyone looks at her in horror .... because, let's face it, the one thing humans are good at is forgetting life lessons.None of this is in the movie ...Not to mention the missing characters such as the narrator/father (well, the many funny theater scenes) ... and all the much needed comic relief crafted into the second half of the musical. (Because the body count is no laughing matter. :)The musical has an intermission after they all get their happy ever after ... so when you see them again time has passed & they are all back to wanting more. Then the giantess starts destroying things as she looks for Jack (because he murdered her Husband ... can't stress that jolly tidbit enough) and their petty wants get pushed aside as life completely is changed for everyone.I would like to say that my disappointment is like that of one whose favorite book is made into a movie ... not everything can fit into those 2 hours. However, this movie did a disservice to those who have never seen the real deal. I have see it/been in it. Can spout almost every line ad nauseam and yet I still cry at the end of even High school Productions. This movie left me cold. I still cry at the ""eyes of an angel..."" animal commercials, but the movie just didn't provide me with an emotional connection.Then there is the scene where the baker runs off after finding out his wife has died. In the play the mysterious man (aka his father) says, ""We disappoint, we disappear, we die but we don't. . . "" and the baker sing a short heartbreaking song that ends, ""...No more giants waging! Can't we just pursue our lives w/our children & our wives 'til that happy day arrives, how do you ignore
All the witches, all the curses, the false hopes, the good-byes, the reverses
All the wondering what even worse is still in store
All the children
All the giants .... just, no more ""In theater we are taught that the actor NOT crying is powerful. You sob because his words resignate, not because he is showing us how sad he is. It's the writer's version of show don't tell.Then there are the children. According to the bonus features, the director feels its supposed to be children and not teenagers. I very very much beg to differ. Hello little girl is a seduction song and has many innuendos that worked sort of ok as Lilla looks 13 -14. Jack is a simpleton but not a child. With them as teenagers, there is a growing up they are suddenly forced to do. They truly have no one. The song, No one is alone didn't seem as powerful because these kids are so young that obviously someone will take care of them. And it seems odd that the baker is willing to say no to letting them stay with him when Jack can't be over 10. Now, if they were teens, then his reluctance is more understandable. Red is a bit scarier in the musical, pulling out her knife ... a fact which makes it funnier when the baker is horrified his wife would leave the baby with Red.The baker and his wife do not argue as much as they do in the play. Theirs is NOT a perfect marriage. No marriage is, but the reality in their relationship are what allow her to be seduced by the prince and let us accept it as paet of her character flaw.In the play, Rapunzel blames the witch for her unhappiness and says, ""because of you, I will never be happy again."" The Witch, whose own mother was NOT great example of motherhood (I mean seriously, who puts a curse on their own child?) Truly tries to protect her child by going to the way opposite extreme (there are parents out there like that). Yes, she does some horrible things in the name of love and she is definitely not a nice person. Her mistakes and how they affected her child go with the theme of the play. Later, Rapunzel is stepped on by the giant as she runs away from the Witch who is trying to save her which changes the whole tone of the Stay with me reprise ... they should've just got rid of that reprise if they were going to change that storyline.I rewatched the movie recently thinking maybe I was so disappointed in 2014 because I had too high of expectations. But no, it is because they took a deep, well-crafted musical and morphed it into an odd sort of movie. They should have just done act 1 and ended it there. Oh, wait, that's basically what they did.",Into the Woods

Too long, boring, no melody in any of the songs, too many meaningless songs, expected some good special effects at the top of the bean stock but nothing, marketed for, but not a movie for children, etc, etc. Maybe the play showed the gruesomeness and evil inside each fairy tale, and got some points for ironic humor, but for the movie, it was an orgy of bad taste. Like Johnny Depp the pedophile. The baker's wife and the Prince commit sin, the wife dies but the Prince lives. The traditional double standard: men can stray but woe to the woman who does. There is a Freudian analysis of fairy tales, showing their sexual, violent, the ID of the personality undercurrents. Maybe the play was thinking of this. But the movie just presented a mish mash, pointless mess.",Into the Woods
235,Roadwarrior85846,"Disney bans Song Of The South, yet they show us this mess...",1,27 December 2014,"When I was a child, I loved so many Disney movies. What am I saying? I STILL LOVE Disney movies! Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Mary Poppins, Bambi, all the timeless classics! The films I grew up on like Beauty and The Beast, Hercules, The Lion King, Toy Story, etc. they were great as well. However, this film, Into the Woods left me utterly disappointed and it should be a sin that it's labeled a Disney movie.The plot, I got to admit, got me interested in the film. The most popular Grimm fairy tales are all combined into one big story. You got Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Jack and The Beanstalk all together. Story goes is that a baker and his wife can't bear a child, so a witch tells them they are cursed by herself because what happened in the past between her and the baker's father. When the baker's father stole from her garden, including her magic beans, her appearance made her hideous looking. So to get even, she cursed his family and kidnaps the baker's sister, for he didn't know he had a sister in the first place. The witch demands them to gather up each object from the separate stories in order to break the spell and will rejoin his sister. By the way, IT'S A MUSICAL!Sounds good on paper, but overall, it was pretty messy to me. Let's start off with the music. I shouldn't rant on saying, ""there's too much singing,"" because it is a musical, of course. I do enjoy a few musicals myself. Little Shop of Horrors, Grease, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers. Heck, even a good amount of films in the Disney library are musicals! But how Into the Woods executed in the music pieces, made the film drag and annoying. Not many actors and actresses aren't even harmonizing to the music. It sounds more like them shouting and blaring out words along with the tempo, showing no feeling nor passion within the story of the song they're singing. The ONLY actress that was spot on every time she sung was Meryl Streep. Her performance was excellent. Emily Blunt did have one song that she did very good on, but that was it. TWO actresses out of the several did their job. Chris Pine's singing approach was a HUGE joke. I couldn't tell his singing performance is suppose to be serious or comical, but either way, it didn't work and it was disturbing.But what got me very confused and disappointed on this movie are the plot holes. TOO MANY PLOT HOLES!!! As I can remember in the film, once the curse is broken, the baker's wife gets pregnant, the witch becomes beautiful again, and the baker can rejoin his long lost sister, which you find out later is Rapunzel. But did the baker ever meet Rapunzel? NO! THEY NEVER MEET! It looks like they could care less of each other! After the second giant destroyed the village, Rapunzel and her prince just gallops away into the darkness, not ever hearing from them again. To top it off, the witch lost her power for a brief moment for that scene.....WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?!?! Also, Jack's mother dies off screen. WHEN IN THE HELL DID THAT HAPPEN?! Last time we saw her, she was yelling at the giant and got shoved away from a wimpy, tiny man and fell flat on her back on tall, soft grass. She looked dazed and dizzy, but that's it, no sign of her dying!!! Slaying the giant was very lazy writing. Couple of rocks hits the giant in the face, killing her. The rocks they threw were pebble size compared to the giant's head. Pathetic.Overall, AVOID this movie. Even if you're a hard core Disney fan, AVOID THE MOVIE. Mediocre acting, lame songs, clearly unwatchable. Meryl Streep did her best on this film to make it look presentable, but her awesome talent couldn't save this failure of a film.",Into the Woods
236,Yelitza-screenwriting-student,Twisted and Wickedly Entertaining Musical Cautionary Tale,8,24 December 2014,"I've seen it three times and want to see it more!In Into the Woods, Disney pours its dark magic potions and talents to bring us an interesting and very creative mixture of the traditional fairy tales. This is not just a musical. It's a cautionary tale, a fable. It's beautiful but it also has bits of horror.I love how several story-lines converge into one--making the whole even more complex and exciting. I also love the surprise factor, most of the time I had no idea what was coming next! Good! The first part of the movie is colorful and is headed to a happy ending, hence the fairy tale part. Then suddenly, things fall apart and it turns gray. Hence, the cautionary part. The story begins with our main characters making bad choices, and these bad choices carry out through the entire movie until it unravels into tragedies. But in the end, our characters have grown--they accept the consequences of their bad choices and build themselves a new life. I think it is entertaining, innovative, exciting, and it will take you to another world. Will it inspire you? It depends. It depends how you interpret the message of the story. The special effects are beautiful, the spectacle is enjoyable – the scenery and staging are captivating. The songs and the singing are wonderful. I enjoyed all that. In general the acting was great. The children give great performances. Chris Pine is gorgeous – definitely prince charming but not necessarily prince goodness. Meryl Streep impersonates a fantastic witch— she is super wicked and she manipulates and takes advantage of the desperate couple to get what she wants. Emily Blunt is brilliant, I wish we could have seen her character succeed in some way by the end of the movie. Johnny Depp makes a fantastic man-wolf that feels more like a child-predator. Pretty scary! A man after a little girl Again, here we see the raw cautionary tale in action. The movie has several messages and warnings. The strongest point: beware of your wishes. Don't let your wishing get on the way of common-sense and virtue and good-will. Don't let your wishes throw you into darkness, because darkness will make you lose yourself and drag others with you. Don't be greedy. Don't be desperate. My 10-year old daughter doesn't want to watch it again. Perhaps is a more appropriate movie for older children. Overall, it's definitely a movie that will entertain you and make you dream and make you think. Please watch it!Enjoy.Thanks for reading. Cheers.",Into the Woods
237,limoncella-641-42235,The Cow randomly dropping dead was the perfect visual metaphor for the whole movie.,2,13 January 2015,"Monotonous, Alienating and Shockingly Cheap looking, Into the Woods is a movie that was seriously misguided from its initial inception.As a musical, it's a total disaster, there is not one single memorable song from the whole film and the songs themselves are ugly monstrosities that are badly mixed and lazily written, as soon as one begins you're practically begging for it to stop.It's a hugely irritating film to watch as an audience member because everything that happens in the film is arbitrary, everything that happens in the movie is something that happens because the film needs to get somewhere, there is no natural flow to the story. Characters suddenly die, characters suddenly appear, characters suddenly can do things they couldn't do before just do get the movie to the next scene without affecting the main plot at all.The story itself it a hodge-podge of classic fairytailes cobbled together to form a unique story for the film, which may not have a been a bad idea for a film, but the actual story they went with makes little sense. Emily Blunt and James Corden are bakers who are trying to have a baby together, but the witch who lives next door (Meryl Streep) has cursed their family to never have children because James Cordens father stole vegetables from her garden years ago. She says she can lift the curse if they find her 4 magical objects and return them to her in 3 nights. That's the main story, there's some minor subplots sprinkled throughout with some iconic fantasy characters but none of that matters, they all converge on Emily Blunt and James Cordens' story.The acting is mostly fine, this movie is shockingly well cast. Meryl Streep is Meryl Streep she was great regardless, Emily Blunt, Anna Kendrick they were fine too. Chris Pine stood out, or at least his accent did, he seemed to be having fun at least. I may be alone here but I liked Johnny Depp, he was in it just enough to not be irritating and I liked the design of his character. But why is James Corden in this? he's a soap opera level actor at best. There's a key scene in the third act where he is told his wife is dead, and Corden acts like he just dropped his fork on the floor.But the worst thing is how Cheap the whole film looks, 95% of the film is shot on a very obvious forest set that looks the same, i'm sure they filmed it from as many angles as possible, but there was no fooling. The CGI was awful, the giants looked unfinished and the background Matte work was obvious and murky, ""we don't have the money to finish a visual effect? cover it in Fog!"".The worst element was how they masked not having a budget for certain scenes. There are 3 instances where Cinderella runs out of the ball to escape the Prince, and in none of the 3 instances do we ever see the inside of the ballroom, just the castle stairs. Jack climbs the beanstalk to reach the giants several times, but instead of showing it through visuals the film has a song number for Jack to sing describing the giants home. Emily Blunt falls off a cliff, but we never see her fall, we never even see her trip over, we never even see her body for pity's sake.It's a mess of a musical, plain and simple, I try not to judge films as soon as they start, but when the movie began and it starts with a horrible musical number, the feeling of dread was powerful. I can only recommend this for die hard fans of musicals and for live-action Disney film completionists.",Into the Woods
238,Boromir28,This is a Stephen Sondheim movie - not Disney,8,23 February 2015,"Good. Now we got that cleared up.This isn't as much a review as it is a response to those who are disappointed with Disney about this movie.Well there's a reason for that: It's not a Disney movie. They didn't have anything to with the characters, plot or the songs. If you didn't know it was a movie adaptation of the Broadway play, tough luck. Now into the movie itself. The good news first:The singers: Wow I was very much impressed with everyone involved. Stephen Sondheim's songs are notoriously difficult to sing, but no one, NO one fell through or left me wanting. Unlike other recent musical movies *cough*Les Miserables*cough*. And in a movie that is 80% singing I was very much entertained in that regard. James Cordon and Emily Blunt had a very good on screen chemistry and were very believable as a couple. Anna Kendrick and Merryl Streep had some difficult songs to sing and were wonderful. Everyone shone in their songs and knew what to do with them. Cudos.Now the bad news:The script: The story was of course given, and the movie had to follow that story. However, some of the changes made and the way it was edited took away the fast paced feel of the play. Scenes took too long to get started and made the movie feel made up of individual stories that didn't quite seem to connect. The last third of the movie was problematic especially. A lot of the lines that would have a theater audience laughing fell flat because of too much background noise from bird, brooks, leaves etc. On to of that the camera angles were often too far away from those talking, so it was hard to know exactly who said what, to whom and why.The overall cinematography was nice looking, but the grey tone that seem to be predominant in every movie these days took away the fantastical element that was so vivid in the stage performance. For instance if I didn't know they were looking for a golden slipper it would be hard to see it really was golden. All in all I think it's an OK movie, but largely because of the music and the actors. The direction, editing and cinematography brings it down. This is not a musical movie for the general public but for those interested in music or know the play. I would say a pre-knowledge of the story is a must to fully enjoy it.",Into the Woods

242,pioneerlythere37,Just What the Fiary Tale Movie Business Needed,9,30 September 2015,"Disney produces a fair amount of fairy tale movies; but most of them come in the form of animated children's movies that turn out to be remarkably similar. For instance, Frozen and Tangled appear to be very different movies, but when examined closely, many comparisons can be found. Most of their movies are also musicals, but Into the Woods is a fresh, newer musical; the way the songs are sung in the animated Disney movies is a great example of how they are similar. But Into the Woods provides more clever, entertaining songs with a totally different style. The film is darker, grittier, and all-in-all more awesome than most of the other fairy tale adaptations. Disney's live-action Cinderella was a huge disappointment, another average fairy tale movie. Tangled is probably the most entertaining of Disney's animated movies, unless Puss in Boots counts as a fairy tale. But really, the only film that rivals Into the Woods for best fairy tale movie is Jack the Giant Slayer, an epic re-envisioning of one of the best fairy tales, if not wackiest.Into the Woods provides good acting and singing on all sides. With a wonderful cast that consists of Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, James Cordon, Anna Kendrick, and Johnny Depp, the movie is pervasively exciting, fun, and original. Based on the Broadway play, the movie sometimes almost appears to be a play: Johnny Depp appears as the Wolf--a wonderful performance that is sadly limited to about five minutes--dressed in a stage costume instead of voicing a CGI wolf. The sets also seem like stages sometimes, and the female giant at the end somehow increases that feeling. The lyrics of the songs are clever and intelligent, sung well by talented actors. I agree with practically everyone else that Meryl Streep is by far the most enjoyable presence, singing her lines in a catchy tone that the other actors can't quite achieve. The set is mostly dreary, shot in darkness, and even a certain level of darkness during the day--because they're in the midst of the woods, of course. I was able to read the screenplay, and after reading it I knew it would be a good movie, but the director and the actors and the designers were able to turn the good script into an even better movie. Some of the cinematography is a bit iffy, such as the female giant at the end, for example, but I found myself not caring; the movie was based off a play and made itself look like a play.The Baker (James Corden) and his barren wife (a pregnant Emily Blunt) want a child more than anything. ""I wish...more than anything...."" is probably the most well-executed song in the movie, the song that is sung by all the characters as we switch back and forth from Jack, to his mother, to Cinderella, to Red Riding Hood, to the Baker and his wife. Yes, it has that many fairy tale characters, and later we are introduced to Rapunzel--and I have to admit, this version of Rapunzel isn't quite as entertaining as the one in Tangled. Jack loves his cow and wishes that it would give milk so that he wouldn't have to sell it, his mother wishes he weren't such a fool, the Baker and his wife want a child, and everyone wishes something. Everyone eventually gets their wish (except for maybe Red Riding Hood), but the Baker has to reverse a spell the witch put on him before his wife is able to give birth. He needs four items: the cow as white as milk, the hood as red as blood, the slipper as pure as gold, the hair the color of corn. Good musical scores and humor follow as he and his wife pursue these items.Into the Woods is a wonderful combination of multiple fairy tales, making a very Grimm-like movie with a sort of crazy plot that reflects the Grimm brothers' works. The movie is also dark, the production design fits perfectly with the movie, and the movie is really just another great example of great American cinema.91/100",Into the Woods

But the backdrop music is very repetitive unlike other musicals.I was not sure if this story was meant to be a mellow drama or a comedy as is suggested in the trailers I also want to point out that this film if aimed a children is fairly dark for a Disney film and is very drawn out and children would become to tire of it after hour and a half Its certainly not a bad film but is a very acquired taste",Into the Woods

245,cuthbertjoel,Get Out Of The Woods...Immediately!,2,19 February 2015,"This film is terrible, and as quickly as possible I'll try to explain why.Firstly, regardless of what the trailers depict, this is a full on musical. I'd say 80% of dialogue is song, so if you hate musicals, steer clear. Myself, I don't mind musicals, so finding out it was a musical didn't kill it for me....yet! The spectrum of acting is vast to say the least. Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt obviously stood out as the two that shone. But, stood next to the likes of James Corden, he looked like someone who had just wandered on to set for an acting class. This made the Corden/Blunt relationship totally unbelievable and all credentials to the plot are gone three minutes into the film.The music itself is abysmal. I can deal with songs being forgettable, but these songs are actively offensive to the ears. Literally, High School Musical had better songs than this. The singing is decidedly poor as well, with several off key notes.Johnny Depp seems to have played his part and been stopped by the director to say..""No Johnny, can we go a bit more paedophilic please?"" This scene was horribly uncomfortable. I felt like calling the police, it was just that sleazy and creepy. The obvious sexual undertones weren't something you would normally see Disney put its name to. He is quickly becoming another Nicolas Cage. Used to be a very good advert for a film but is fast becoming a deterrent (The Lone Ranger and Transcendence come to mind).That said, I'm not sure A-list acting all round could have saved this movie. The plot is tedious, the characters are boring. The film would have maybe scraped a 4 or 5 out of 10 from me had it not had another 25 pointless minutes after what I thought was going to be the end.Awful film and a waste of a good cast (except James Corden).",Into the Woods

Jack the boy, who's only pastime is to milk his cow, and insists on thinking the cow is a 'he', gets slapped by his mother after she tells him only females give milk while he gives her a look of 'not true'.

Therefore, the visuals never distracted me from the lyrics of the songs and I was amazed at how well Grimms' Fairy Tales (closer to the real tales the brothers told, not the Disney versions) were thrown together and used as adult metaphors and life lessons. Bad people can be exciting to be around. Nice people are not always good, and good people are not always nice. Looking for solutions to problems is smarter than trying to assign blame. For personal growth, we often have to leave our comfort zones and journey to dark and scary places (into the woods). Ultimately, be careful what you wish for, and if you are going to pursue your wishes at all costs, know there will be consequences and you may not really want what you thought you did.I think the film does a fantastic job of bringing the musical to the big screen.

Think I just got a new least favourite mov-- oh wait. Nope, the original one still stands. *One* of the least favourite movies. At first I thought with Kendrick, Blunt and Pine, and knowing it was Disney, this was gonna be pretty much happy romantic-family-comedy movie, but Nooo! Jesus. With Streep I knew there's less than likely to have chances of romance, and Oh no they seriously did not put idiot Planchet from The Three Musketeers into this! Lots of reasons to have hatred in this movie. For one, this movie is just like a Disney version of Les Mis - and I Really hate the 2012 Les Mis. Honest Trailers got it right on the money - All those things could literally be easily done Just By Talking Normally. I know it's a musical, but man, The Sound of Music was a musical too, and I don't find THAT weird! Next, the colour tone really is anti-Disney. Looked like a regular drama movie from a low-budget or direct-to- DVD film with close-to-zero plot points(and even those have better ones than this!). It already pained me to see the new Disney opening sequence changed/evolved on movies Pirates of the Caribbean, and now this! Wonder how long before they get a ""shattered-and-broken Disney castle on fire with anti-air flak cannon and surface-to-air missile firing as fireworks"" sequence: Disney is truly going dark. Then, from the moment I heard the tune ""I Wish"", I immediately lost interest in the movie. Especially when I heard Red's tune ""I wish~"" Man I just wanted to send an orbital artillery to the baker shop. Seriously? The plot was like any old clichés - someone got some powerful ones furious and their progeny have to undo the aftermath and to achieve that they have to obtain some collectibles/quest items which have to be obtained via certain conditions with will have to be achieved via certain conditions... Jeez. After that it's the dark version of some of the most classic Grimm Fairy Tales(Seriously, Jacob and Wilheim would totally puke up there), and funny enough, they took away all the supposedly happy endings and replaced them with... well... ""boing""s. That one scene I remembered the most - When Prince Pine brings Lady Kendrick her shoe(oddly it's gold and not glass or crystal) and asks her to be his wife, she declined-- Ashputtel, what happened to you? Also, in the end the idiot baker got what he set out for - but at what cost? Disney used to make movies about perfect victories, not pyrrhic ones. This really is a d*ck move. Ashputtel, Beanstalk, Red... Disney took all these Ancient Classics and flushed all of them down the toilet. And that's not all. The hell happened to Disney's old concluding one-liner, ""...and they lived happily ever after""? This is the line which created movies that gave people hope! That's the creed that led to tons of Disney successes! What happened to all that? The old belief and faith all lost? No one believes in ""happily ever after""s anymore? Well, I do, and I'm crazy disappointed with this. All in all, I think my endings would be better - ""After the events occurred, camera pans up, song stops. And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, a cruise missile flew in and detonated on the ground of the Woods, zeroing in on where the main characters were. A blinding flash, a enormous explosion - the kind visible in orbit, and... silence. Fade out. Roll credits."" Boom! Nailed it. Disney, stand aside.",Into the Woods
250,scooterberwyn,The best Sondheim film adaptation EVER!,10,25 December 2014,"When I think ""Sondheim musical"" I do not include ""West Side Story"" or ""Gypsy"" even though he had a hand in them. But when one thinks of those films, it's the choreography (in the former) and the music (in the latter) that come to mind. No, the true ""Sondheim musical"" genre begins with ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" and continues (with a detour for ""Do I Hear a Waltz?"") to the present day.Precious few of Sondheim's shows have made the transition to film. Aside from the previously-mentioned ""Forum"" we have ""A Little Night Music"" and ""Sweeney Todd,"" all of which have major flaws. I don't include filmed stage productions such as ""Passion"" and ""Sweeney Todd"" as these are sui generis. Alas, ""Anyone Can Whistle,"" ""Company,"" ""Follies,"" Merrily We Roll Along,"" ""Pacific Overtures,"" and ""Assassins"" have never been given full film treatments.When I heard that Disney was producing the film ""Into the Woods"" I was very apprehensive, fearing that the studio would sanitize it beyond all recognition. Thankfully, that is not the case. Disney and Rob Marshall have gathered a creditable cast of genuine singing actors. Yes, a few minor changes to the stage show have been made and a couple of songs have been changed or omitted, but considering Hollywood's track record with adaptations of Broadway musicals, the film is very faithful to the source material.Emily Blunt is rapidly becoming my favorite current film actress. Here she is the heart and soul of the story, along with the, to me, hitherto unnoticed James Corden. Meryl Streep is her usual sterling self as the witch. Bernadette Peters set a high standard on stage, but Streep makes the role her own. Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen are marvelous in their ""Agony"" duet, each out-posturing the other in macho bravado. Tracey Ullman was a very pleasant surprise as the mother of Jack, ably played by Daniel Huttlestone. Lilla Crawford is fine, although she's a bit too young to put across the sexual awakening that Little Red Riding Hood experiences after encountering the Big Bad Wolf (an all-too-briefly seen Johnny Depp). Perhaps that may have been part of the Disney-fication of the show.It's truly gratifying to have seen such a magnificent treatment of what may be becoming Sondheim's most popular musical. I loved it!",Into the Woods
251,holloway-sarahjane,"some good moments, but not that great",7,25 December 2014,"There were a few exceptionally good moments, the 2 princes singing together was one of the best, but in the end it got too generic. There were good lines, good acting, and good cgi, but it didn't come across that brilliantly. It got some applause from the audience but some yawns too. A bit too long, and the singing seemed like one long continuous tune after 2 hours. There weren't any tunes that will stick with you just kind of annoying sing song rhymes. Finally the ending was ""meh"". I mostly enjoyed the concept of combining all the fairy tales and some of the black humor (eyes being pecked out by Cindrella's pet birds). It was hard to care much about any of the characters, they were all muddled as very human and flawed. On the whole it was taking fairy tales and making them modern parables about people not being careful for what they wished.",Into the Woods
252,andy-66447,"""Into The Woods"" Is Terrible Adaptation Of Hit Musical",4,24 August 2015,"I love Stephen Sondheim's musical classic Into The Woods, so I was more than excited to see Rob Marshall's new motion picture adaptation. Not only is Into The Woods one of my favorite musicals, but Rob Marshall was the director who brought Kander & Ebb's Chicago to the big screen in 2002 – an effort which resulted in the first musical to win the Best Picture Oscar since 1968! In fact, since Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge update in 2001, several major musicals have been successfully adapted to the big screen – including Chicago, Dreamgirls, and the unfairly criticized Les Miserables just two years ago.I hate to say it, but Into The Woods does not fall into this category. I found the film dreary, draggy, and quite frankly, boring. How can this be? It's the same dialogue, the same music, the same set, and the same costumes as we see on stage. But therein lay the problem. On stage, set designers create ""the woods,"" and the actors move in and out of these woods. We use our imagination to pretend the woods are larger than what we see on stage. Here, the woods are huge. After all, these are the movies. Unfortunately, the woods all look the same. Marshall may as well have filmed a stage performance. Furthermore, the sky is always cloudy, giving the picture a dirty, dingy feel.Into these woods, several classic stories interconnect, including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack & The Beanstalk, and Rapunzel. Tying all the stories together is the story of a baker and his wife, who are unable to conceive a child due to a curse placed on them by the witch who lives next door. On stage, characters from the various fairy tales bump into one another in hilarious fashion, and eventually all the loose ends are wrapped up and most of the characters live happily ever after.But the film has one major flaw, and that is that the loose ends are tied up too soon. The sun finally shines on Cinderella's wedding day, as all the townsfolk join the celebration. I looked at my watch and realized we were only an hour Into The Woods, causing me to wonder what director Rob Marshall was going to do with the rest of the movie. On stage, Cinderella's wedding is merely a formality – a necessary conclusion to the story we all know, but certainly not the end of the musical. Here, Marshall gives the wedding scene such heft – and differentiates it from the previous hour's worth of material – that we feel like it's time to get up and leave.At this point, the film version goes awry. The players begin behaving out of character for reasons never explained. For instance, how could the handsome prince consider Cinderella the love of his life one day, and then cheat on her the next? Why does Jack's mother die? (Her death is one of the funniest scenes on stage. Here, it happens so quickly, I wasn't even sure if she had died or not. And Jack's demeanor doesn't change one iota.) Another problem is Stephen Sondheim himself. You see, Sondheim is a lyricist. When he wrote the lyrics for Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story, the result was one of the best stage and screen musicals of all time. But when Sondheim writes his own melodies, the result is often wordy, tuneless ditties you won't remember two minutes after leaving the theatre. Again, on stage this is no big deal. In fact, it almost accentuates the material to feature the characters speaking and singing in similar speech patterns. But on screen, I had that, ""Not another song!"" feeling all through the third act – the way I did with Barbra Streisand's Yentl back in 1983.I certainly can't knock the performances, although Anna Kendrick's remarkable turn as Cinderella is the only one that stands out from the rest. Her character seems genuine, and she gives Cinderella a few new dimensions, rather than simply fulfilling the role we think we know from the fairy tale. Three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep has been nominated for another Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as the witch. She's fine, but she won't win. I could name at least a dozen Streep performances better than this one.It's a disappointment to me that Into The Woods didn't adapt better to the big screen. That makes three films this season that I really wanted to like, and was disappointed at the outcome – Birdman, Inherent Vice, and now Into The Woods. Throughout the course of motion picture history, it often seems as though the best musicals are those written directly for the screen, such as Singin' In The Rain or Mary Poppins. Adapting material from another source is always risky. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. As I've thought more about Into The Woods, I wonder if this isn't one of those musicals that simply wasn't meant to adapt to the screen. Remember Richard Attenborough's inexcusable A Chorus Line? That's another great, intimate show that simply doesn't work on the large easel of the motion picture screen. I fear that's what we have here with Into The Woods.",Into the Woods
253,klasikvhs,Well Cast!!! (even if a bit too repetitive score),10,26 December 2014,"Sondheim is a modern master... but I've never been able to sit through the stage version of this show because the music is just so repetitive. The title song is reprised way too much as is ""No One Is Alone"" which also sounds far too much like Sweeney Todd's ""Nothing's Gonna Harm You"" at the start.BUT I loved this film, thanks to the cast and I give Mr. Marshall props for casting them all (I would've loved to have seen Joanna Lumley as the step-mother, but meh...) especially after he miscast Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart! and there really was no choreography for Mr. Marshall to screw up, like he did in Chicago. (If you're going to steal from Fosse, you have an obligation not to screw it up).Meryl Streep has positioned herself VERY WELL to take on the role of Norma Desmond should the film adaptation of Sunset Blvd ever make it to screen. Her voice has come a long way and strengthened so much! Just saw it for a 2nd time and like it even better. Mr Sondheim is as Shakespeare. If you relax and listen to the words you will be taken far away from your dreary lives! Also I wanted to add how wonderful little jack is in the film. He was just as perfectly cast as he was in Les Miz as gavroche.",Into the Woods
254,atlastu2,Too much woods is not good,7,8 January 2015,"I am a big fan of musicals. And I was excited to see this movie cause of the interesting cast. but what I didn't like in the film is that even though it had lots of songs none of them were good enough to stick In your head. I don't know why,maybe it's because there's too much words in the songs. what I liked was how they combined more than one fairy tale in one story . that was interesting how they mixed jack and the beanstalk,red Riding Hood,cinderlla and repenzenl all In one. but it's very disappointing how Johnny Depp only appeared in one scene. about the cast,we'll It's not bad,meryl strepp was good as the crazy witch and the Baker and his wife were good as a couple.

255,dmhughes-448-695102,"A Worthy, Though Imperfect Adaptation Of A Classic Musical",7,24 December 2014,"When I heard back in 2013 that an adaptation of Steven Sondheim's classic musical Into the Woods was being made into a film, I felt apprehensive. I've never been the biggest fan of lead actress Meryl Streep or director Rob Marshall; I worried about how Emily Blunt, Anna Kendrick, and Chris Pine would fare in the singing department (I had fears of another Mamma Mia! Pierce Brosnan debacle), and any confidence I had left in Johnny Depp was pretty much wiped out when I viewed his latest cinematic duds The Lone Ranger (2013) and Transcedence (2014). Most of all, I was afraid that Disney would try and omit the dark humor and more adult- oriented themes and songs present in Sondheim's musical in favor of more child-friendly slapstick. Thankfully, Marshall and Co. have managed to keep the spirit of the musical and the Brothers' Grimm fairy tales intact, and despite a few spotty CGI effects and a third act that feels a bit rushed (sort of like the musical), the performances are all well done, many of the songs are well performed and choreographed, and overall, the film is quite enjoyable to watch.The plot of Into the Woods (2014) is actually several different Grimm fairy tales, which include ""Rapunzel"", ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", ""Cinderella"", and ""Little Red Riding Hood"", all interweaving with a central plot about the Baker and the Baker's Wife (James Cordon and Emily Blunt), a couple who seek to end their curse of being childless, which was placed upon them by the Witch (Meryl Streep). The Witch offers them a chance to bear a child if they can collect several items; these items in turn are all related to the other fairy tale characters.Almost all of the actors are excellent in their roles, and surprisingly, their singing is pretty good. Meryl Streep carries the movie, and unlike Mamma Mia! (2008), her singing doesn't feel cheesy or forced. Also, her makeup and prosthetics are top notch, and really proves why ugly witches are still the best in movies. Blunt and Cordon are quite good in their roles, and have a fair share of funny moments. Anna Kendrick and Mackenzie Mauzie are adequate as Cinderella and Rapunzel, but ultimately their characters feel a little underdeveloped. Chris Pine is surprisingly excellent as Cinderella's Prince, and his duet ""Agony"" with Billy Magnussen as Rapunzel's Prince is easily my favorite moment in the film. Surprisingly, Johnny Depp is decent as the Wolf, and his scenes with Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) manage to keep their dark and humorous themes intact. Finally, Daniel Huttlestone does a great job as Jack, reminding me once again why I felt he gave one of the best performances in Les Miserables (2012).As I mentioned in the introduction, I did feel that the last third of the film feels pretty rushed, and like the musical, it feels like a section that was added just to turn what is supposed to be a happy ending, into a bittersweet one. Also, while most of the sets and costumes (yes, even the Wolf) are excellent, some exterior CGI shots like the beanstalk, and the Princes' castle didn't look very good, which is disappointing knowing the rest of the effects and sets are of such a high quality. Overall, Into the Woods is an adaptation, unlike recent films Jersey Boys and Annie (2014), that mostly works. The songs are catchy, the choreography is well done, and the the performances are consistently funny. With the exception of a lackluster final act, this is probably the best adaptation of Sondheim's musical that we could possibly get, and I commend Marshall and Co. for their work.Final Verdict: 7/10",Into the Woods
256,yoitsfears,was this supposed to be a gag movie?,5,14 July 2021,Was this written to make fun of fairy tale stories? Thats the only thing that makes sense as to why this is so bad.

A true return to movies like: Mary Poppins and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, this film really shocked me with the story, acting and Shrek Esq feel. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it and will recommend it to anyone. The songs are so catchy (especialy the title song) and performed so well by all the actors. And lets be honest, you cannot really go wrong when Meryl Streep is involved. For me I was pleasantly surprised at the story. It was not what I was expecting and I think that's the main reason why I enjoyed it so much. My only 2 issues are that the film could have been a bit shorter. It does feel too long. And that there is not really any in-depth character development. But hey, not every film is perfect. In Short I had a lot of fun and feel it's definitely worth a watch.",Into the Woods

I have not walked out of a movie in over a decade but i did about 90% thru it... I just couldn't stomach it anymore. I now know why Disney chose not to highlight the fact that this was a musical.

260,nintendogs03,Wow! Well done everyone!,9,2 January 2015,"I loved it!!! And I am not saying this because I am a HUGE fan of musicals and fairy tales. Into the Woods put me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. The trailer is kind of misleading, since it only presents viewers the first half of the movie, but it does not mean it should be unavoidable altogether. I am so glad that I got to see Daniel Huttlestone in this. He was amazing as Gavorche in Les Mis and he blew me away as Jack in this. Same with Lilia Crawford; she will have a solid career one day. Anna Kenderick was amazing as always: loved her in pitch perfect, also love her in this. Emily Blunt and James Corden played their roles perfectly and of course, Meryl Strep stole the show. Johnny Depp has some moments as the wolf, but he was better in this than in Crybaby. Chris Pine made me realize that I always disliked Prince Charming (the character, not him and his singing) and Billy Magnussen was very charming indeed. Christine Baranski (the stepmother) was a delight to see on the big screen, as she is exciting to watch as Leonard's mother on Big Bang Theory. Props to the casting directors! The set was beautiful! It perfectly captures the tone of the film. I know people hate that there is not enough bright colors, but it is supposed to be dark and the play is even darker, but what am I saying, I'm not exactly an expert on the movie industry. Great, know the songs are stuck in my head, which is not a bad thing at all. Agony was alright and I started cracking up in the middle of it, but everything else was beautiful. What annoyed me was when the credits rolled, me and one other person started clapping in a full theater. Do people actually like it or they just refuse to applaud? Because when I watched Unbroken, the entire theater applauded and cheered once the credits rolled in (another amazing film to check out!). Ignore everything I typed, bravo! bravo!",Into the Woods

262,Muskox53,"Fine movie of this musical, but there are some badly mismatched voices",8,17 June 2017,"Yes, some changes are made in the stage version (surprise! that's what always happens when stage musicals are filmed), and some of those changes work better than others. And the music is wonderful—perhaps not quite Sondheim at his very best, but still creative, inventive, and memorable. The one issue that seriously detracts from the film is the mismatching of voices. The Brits (James Corden, Emily Blunt) sing like well-trained Lieder singers, with a smooth vocal quality that is well supported throughout the vocal range and an even vibrato. Some of the Americans (Anna Kendrick and especially Lilla Crawford) are Broadway belters, complete with flat vowels and intrusive vibrato—voices trained to be sung into mikes—always at the same high level of intensity and no tenderness whatsoever. It's not just a US vs. English thing, since some of the other Americans, notably Meryl Streep and Chris Pine, manage their voices quite well. But the four survivors of the story leave us with a vocal quartet that is wildly uneven. The two males, the Baker and Jack, have smooth well-modulated British voices; the two females, Cinderella and Red Riding Hood, in ensembles with them, are almost unlistenable. Did Marshall plan it like this? He must have, but it's hard to see why.",Into the Woods
263,beeblebrox-2,Phenomenal screen adaptation,8,16 May 2017,"The fact that Sondheim was able to develop music for the stage play and then director Rob Marshall managed to adapt the play so well for the screen is, in and of itself, worth 5 stars out of the gate. But then add pitch perfect performances (another star), phenomenal sets (an additional star), cinematography (another), and wonderful orchestrations and this is an easy 8 out of 10. Reviewers who rate this a 1, are to be blunt, garbage people and need to be ignored. If you want to find a movie to rate a 1 go review a Fast and Furious movie or something. But this is a fantastic work of art and work and, at the very least, haters should appreciate the talent and care that went into this film. Into The Woods is actually not that listenable on stage because it's hard to separate the performances. Sondheim's music is so layered and antiphonal that it's difficult to follow when you see the show. But in the film, Marshall provides the texture the composer had in mind but radically improves the intelligibility of the lyrics and hence, the story-line. Given that the story itself is a little contrived, I can't give it a 10 like I would for a few other classic musicals, but then, I knew what to expect story-wise, going in. To give this a low rating because it was ""boring"" or the ""music wasn't good"" means you're not the target audience. That's all.",Into the Woods
264,sweetboyy_99,"Awkward, but strangely enjoyable",6,17 March 2015,"A few years ago Disney announce that they would be focusing on a lot more live-action retellings of fairy tales. I loved the idea, and some of them do turn out pretty awesome. Into The Woods is originally a Broadway musical, and is indeed, intended to be. As many Broadway to silver screen adaptions of musicals are pretty mediocre I was eager to find out if this was actually any good. After several opinions from friends & family, I decided to check this one out. I walked into the movie with lower expectations; the expectation to have fun, like I do on any Disney film. So the question is; was it? Let's find out.It starts out with a very (VERY) annoying but fun and bright song were they literally sing out the films title a gazillion times(obviously so that movie reviewers can remember the name after.) There's four fairy tales in this: Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk and Rapunzel. So the main plot actually revolves around the baker and his wife who wishes to have kids, but somehow can't manage to have kids. It turns out the bakers dad had done a terrible thing in the past to a witch(played by Meryl Streep). The witch had put a curse on the family and it turns out that is the reason they can't have kids. The baker (and his wife) sets out to get the ingredients that the Witch need in order for her to turn beautiful again, and if they bring the ingredients the Witch would reverse the spell. That's pretty much the plot in short. A lock of golden hair, a cow as white as snow, a red cape and a slipper. You get the fairy tales you all love and know in a different retelling and surprisingly it works very well. Although this type of movie doesn't fall in the taste of all people, it's very enjoyable in it's own way and I thought it had a special charm that made it unique and playful. The first half had bright and beautiful scene while the second half had darker scenes.The casting was well done and I loved the singing, also it had some very fun and enjoyable songs (although they're pretty annoying and not so rememberable). I did not have any difficulties with the casting and acting was more than respectable. Disney has always been good at casting.I feel though as this was not a finished film. They could have been more imaginative and done so much more with the way things happen (if you've seen the Broadway show, you'll know what I mean). Sure, there are some pretty impressive and clever scenes, for example Little Red Riding Hood scene when she was swallowed by the wolf and she meets her grandma, and I thought the way the wolf was portrayed (with the always excellent actor Johnny Depp) was awesome and I wish they had done more in that style. However, the visuals are beautiful and well done, although they could have done more with it. It was a pretty awkward film, but I still thought it was strangely enjoyable. It's not a film I would like to watch again very soon, but it was actually a pretty enjoyable film. It has gotten a lot of criticism and I see why, but this film was not meant to be an Oscar, it's pretty clear already at the start of the film. It's just a fun and interesting twist on fairy tales and I actually thought the way they blended the fairy tales together was cleverly done. I liked it.The music was all right, although not perfect and definitely not the best musical out there. But it's visuals and the casting was really great. I haven't watched the full Broadway musical, and people seem to be mad since Disney apparently changed a lot of the second half. It's nothing new really, Disney has always changed stories both in their classic and modern films to fit their audience which is pretty much children. I liked it anyway and I can't really judge the difference between the film and the Broadway show. But for what it is, I was pretty happy with the movie, although I won't be watching it again very soon. I've watched Les Miserables probably more than 40 times already, but that's nothing I would say I want to do with this particular film.All in all, the cast and the vfx's are the best part of the movie. it's a movie you don't take seriously, not a piece of Oscar work. For what it is, it deserves at least a 6 out of 10.",Into the Woods
265,Philipe14,Lots of Fun,9,3 January 2015,"I had no idea what I was going to see other than what I learned from previews, but Meryl Streep as a Witch was something I just couldn't pass up. I am 63 years old, and nobody ever told me that the Wicked Witch, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Rapunzel apparently all live in the same kingdom where Jack grew his Beanstalk, so I am trying to catch up with my deprived childhood here, OK? I viewed it with an afternoon audience full of kids and parents, and they loved it. Actually applauded and cheered after a couple of the songs. A big unexpected plus for me was that they killed off Johnny Depp (the Big Bad Wolf) in the first part of the show. (If only they'd thought of that in earlier projects, but then, you can't make a Lone Ranger movie without Tonto, can you? But in Depp's case, it would have been worth considering.....) Anyway, the lyrics and score carry much of the story here, particularly to illustrate the emotional twists and turns happening with each character, and there are no weak spots when it comes to the actors carrying their tunes. (Unless somebody was voiced-over and I didn't notice....) The downside is that you wish everybody could live happily ever after, but as in most fairy tales, the tragedy of life is that people you love sometimes die too soon, and so it is here, unless something of their life continues on with you.

Anna Kendrick is my favorite, she does not put a single wrong foot forward, and her character makes sense. Emily Blunt and James Corden as the two main characters are very good. Meryl is also very good; not 100% sure of whether her voice was good enough for some of the songs her character sings.The only character I found upsetting was Chris Pine's Cinderella's Prince. He seemed to mug his way through the film. Also, don't understand why they made Johnny Depp's Wolf a man in a zoot suit instead of a wolf who could sing.Already thinking about seeing the movie again, to appreciate it more. And by the way, I don't understand the harsh criticism towards Rob Marshall. Loved Nine and Chicago.",Into the Woods
267,max-850,"What is the point, really?",6,26 December 2014,"This is an adaptation of a Broadway musical that didn't seem to work so well on Broadway so I'm not sure why they wanted to make it into a movie. That being said, if you're going to go ahead and spend millions of dollars on making it into a movie, why not fix some of the problems that existed in the play? Or adapt it in a very loose way and do something really different with it? It seems somewhat like shooting oneself in the foot. You make a sophisticated musical for adults out of children's stories or fairy tales? Who is the audience? And ultimately, what does it add up to? I'm confused. When all was said and done it was much too long and much too confused about what it was trying to be or say. Is it trying to be a comedy? There are some great funny moments like Christine Baranski's scene stealing bit and Meryl Streep's great it in it but that's not enough to call it a comedy. It needs to be really funny if it's going to be a comedy. If it's not a comedy then it is just not engaging. The mishmash of fairy tales doesn't really add up to anything. I like the music, but the script is merely workmanlike with a few good moments. That's not enough. I loved Meryl Streep and Christine Baranski but the rest of the cast was just okay with an overly expository script that dragged them down. It gets tedious. I went to see it with a group of 6 people. 4 fell asleep. Nuff said.",Into the Woods
268,mowasteph,Very Good Adaptation of the Broadway Musical,6,8 January 2015,"I'm giving the movie such a good review because I've seen and absolutely loved this brilliant Sondheim Broadway musical. It's a genius piece of work. Funny, sad, human.I just have to address a lot of the reviews I'm seeing here. Are you people stupid, or what? First off, there's a lot of ""don't take your kids!"" Well DUH! Whoever said it was a kid's movie? It wasn't a kid's musical on the stage either. Some people here are shocked by some of the themes. The whole point of this work was to address adult themes using fairy tales and dead-clever lyrics. Why don't you people do a little research before you take your kids to a movie? Secondly, there's nothing in here that kids couldn't stand to know about anyway. I didn't grow up watching children's movies. I watched regular movies. Maybe the proliferation of children's movies is what's making each generation just a bit more stupid.Next up: the people who say it's confusing. Again, I weep for this country. What in the world in this story could possibly be confusing? Every single theme is spelled out for you in the lyrics of every song. Or are you just the type of people who don't actually listen to any words? Are you the type of people who won't watch old black and white movies because there is too much dialogue?Anyway, I thought this adaptation was quite faithful and it was very nice visually. Good performances by all with standouts being Streep and Kendrick. My only two complaints? First, there was a reprise of ""Agony"" by the two princes in the play that was cut for the movie. This is a very funny piece in which the two now-married princes sing of their growing boredom and how they are now pining after two new young maidens who sound suspiciously like Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. I wished they'd kept that in.Secondly, I was a tad shocked that they used an ACTUAL little girl to play Red. (although the actress was superb) But it did make the sexual innuendo between her and the wolf a little weird. On the stage this role was always shown as being perhaps-teenaged, but nevertheless a fully-developed young woman. Therefore, on the stage, Red and The Wolf's interactions come off as a real-life situation of young womanhood and not something downright criminal!",Into the Woods

A scene where Johnny Depp is basically singing a song about a ""juicy young girl"" he wants to eat but instead of you imagining him as a wolf you're imagining him as a sick stalker pedophile. Having fun yet? This film has scenes of mutilation of women's feet to fit a shoe, because what we need in a kids story tale movie is ""SAW Part 8"" ... And constant references to women being literally chased around by men like objects , and last but not least a random sudden scene of a married man and woman cheating on their spouses.

However, I like this movie, because it has lesson on life. All characters have difficulties and conflicts, but the root is their desires. And in the woods, things go wrong. This means that desire calls another desire, and we human are always obsessed by those desires. It is sure that the content is obscure, but I was moved by the figures that characters manage to go on their lives. Those are the reflection of our lives, so we can watch this movie along the characters. Also, the songs sung by actors are beautiful, ironic, moving, and so on. There are many kinds of songs that the characters sing their feelings.",Into the Woods
271,violetta1485,Probably best adaptation possible,9,2 January 2015,"I saw this on Broadway in the 80s and did the show in Brooklyn in the 90s, so I am very familiar with the original, and think this was as good an adaptation as could be done, when a show is based on so many theatrical conventions. Without an intermission, the whole point of Act II--that it's what happens AFTER ""happily-ever-after,"" and Act I is designed to set it up--might be lost, and clearly was on people who saw the movie and didn't know the show. And I missed the wonderful moment when the narrator discovers you can't tell a story without risking becoming a part of it! I also missed several numbers: Agony II, the Witch's Act II rap (""Manticore?"" ""Imaginary"" ""Gryphon?"" ""Extinct""), ""No More,"" and lines and verses from the songs included, although I understand they had time-constraints. Most of all, I miss the way the opening of ACT II made it clear that, even before the characters face an unexpected danger, getting their wishes hasn't brought perfect happiness: the longed-for baby strains an already troubled marriage, Jack's mother still treats him like a baby, Little Red hasn't learned that relying on her family and her street smarts won't always be enough, Rapunzel's traumatic upbringing has left her permanently damaged emotionally, and both Rapunzel's prince and Cinderella's only want what they can't have.I think the biggest flaw here is the marketing, not the movie. Disney should have made clear this was a musical (some comments here show viewers were surprised, and not pleasantly), plus that it would return to the dark quality of the original fairy tales (many of which were quite violent, complete with cutting feet and Hitchcockian birds--Grimm can be GRIM--and BTW, the original wolf IS a warning to girls against the other kind of Wolf, in some versions, he tells Little Red to get into bed with him!). Most of all, they should have publicized the fact that the show's focus is AFTER ""happily-ever-after,"" and how the characters discover that their actions have consequences. Act I ends with ""You can't just wish, you have to act!"" Act II ends with ""You can't just act, you have to listen."" Every song involves a character's opportunity to grow from experience, and I'm not sure all viewers got that. They seemed frustrated when the music didn't carry the story forward. Changing the publicity rather than the movie might have set up more accurate expectations.",Into the Woods

274,therocksbarneyreviews,"""Into The Woods"" is a great film that leaves you wondering whether you just walked out of the cinema or the theatre.",8,13 January 2015,"""Into The Woods"" is a musical fantasy film, adapted for the screen from its Broadway equivalent. I know, it didn't sound appealing to me either, but ""Into The Woods"" is instead actually quite enjoyable In fact it's actually given be a bit of a craving to see the other musical film you've probably heard of, ""Les Miserables"". But for ""Into The Woods"" there are some great performances, the songs are actually quite catchy and the way the film is shot meant I was never quite sure whether I was watching ""Into The Woods"" on the screen or stage.In regards to performances, I can't not mention Meryl Streep (playing The Witch), James Corden and Emily Blunt (playing The Baker and The Bakers Wife respectively) for theirs. I'm not normally a fan of Meryl Streep. I've only really liked her previously in ""The Iron Lady"" but here she is great, playing a well-made character, although the script obviously does the majority of this for her. Although she has a lesser role than the films five main characters she stood out to me as its lead. Corden's and Blunt's characters are both good fun too. Corden himself provides a lot of the comedy for the film, but it's great that he does it not in how he self-deprecates himself as he has done to an extent with his previous work, but in a way that is normal for a Disney film and again, although the script does most of the work for him, Corden does well and this could deservedly be a breakthrough role into Hollywood for him. Whilst I'm talking about performances, I can't not mention the quality of the singing too. Surprisingly I didn't think there was a single bad voice. There will be, and quite rightly so, no mocking like there was of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe in ""Les Miserables"". Each voice is good and it adds to how catchy the songs are. I've got to admit, I found myself walking out of the cinema down the escalator quietly singing to myself the film's opening number, ""Prologue: Into The Woods"". I also surprisingly found myself with a bit of a smile on my face when Chris Pine (playing Cinderella's Prince) was singing ""Agony"", although he was pretty poor otherwise.The singing of course makes you feel unsure, as I mentioned earlier, as to whether you are in a cinema or the theatre and what contributes to this is how the film is shot. There are only two sweeping landscape shots, both of the woods, but the rest of the film is shot in a style reminiscent of the National Theatre Live productions, bar a perhaps more energetic camera. A perfect example of this is when Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen (playing Rapunzel's Prince) were singing ""Agony"". They sing whilst making their way down a river, splashing around in the water and onto rocks, and the way the camera catches them made me feel like I was in the theatre, close to the stage looking up at what was going on, and this is consistent throughout the film.What takes the film down a notch is its ending. I of course won't go and spoil anything, but it seems a bit unnecessary. Although there are several lessons to be learnt, there are too many to take in and just when I thought I knew what the film was trying to teach me, in came another lesson. And another. But I suppose this reflects the amount of fairy tales the film packs into it. These morals follow on though from relatively dark events, and it seems that the films ending takes a step back from what we know to be the classic Disney fairy tale and one step closer towards its grimmer roots. (See what I did there?)""Into The Woods"" is a great film, and for those who are not now fans of Disney in general, but perhaps owned every single Disney film on VHS when they were younger, *cough*, this is a fun trip back into childhood for them, but a great film otherwise for anyone else.

275,scurvytoon,Not bad for a toned down version of the original,3,17 January 2015,"Having seen the current Disney version of Into the Woods, I'm impressed how the removal of a few songs,a few key scenes, toning down the sexual tension through editing and more modest costuming(like giving Wolf trousers to hide his cod piece), you can take an edgy adult musical and turn it into an almost but not quite edgy family, slightly scary film. I'm happy musicals are making a comeback but I miss Bernadette Peters in the witch role and surprise, Corden can sing. Jack's mother and the step mother in the film would each have made much better witches than Meryl Streep. Personally I miss the kitsch of a plastic cow throughout as it added more pathos and humour to the piece than the live one. By splitting the roles of Prince and Wolf an undercurrent is lost and the assumption the audience can handle a little analogy is abandoned. As for the wholesale savaging/sanitizing of the original 2nd act, it causes the film to collapse into a series of disconnected vignettes followed by repercussions that seem to be overly harsh and cause us also to wonder what happened to certain characters. If you never see the original I guess it's sort of OK, but guess what? You can see the original cast and hear all the songs if you look for it intact. So save your money and watch it the way it was meant to be, but by all means if you can't wait a few years for your child to be subjected to sexual innuendo,coming of age issues, philosophic discussions about morality etc... then this film will do.",Into the Woods

277,mober1996,Fairly disappointing,5,2 January 2015,"""Into The Woods"" was a film that I didn't really do much research on before I went in to watch. The only knowledge that I possessed about this movie was that there were woods, and that Johnny Depp was dressed up as a wolf (and looked hilariously fabulous doing it). I went it to theater, took my seat, and a few minutes later, music began to play. It turns out that the movie was a musical, which would make sense because I believe the movie was either originally a Broadway musical, or the movie turned into a Broadway musical (either one). Now, it is difficult to produce an interesting and entertaining musical in a movie format. You need to have the same format as a movie, and then you have to throw musical performances on top of it that can relate to the movie/scene taking place, this can create a clash between the two concepts and therefore can make it a tough piece to produce.What ""Into The Woods"" did correctly. ""Into The Woods"" was full of personality and interesting characters that kept me watching throughout its course (even though Little Red Riding Hood's appearance kept reminding me of Wednesday from The Addams Family). As well as being able to actually link all of the characters together in interesting ways. The film had an easy time keeping the mood light and charming, just as well as it did making it dark and dank. The storytelling and how it comes all around together in the end was one of the best points that this movie contained, and left me at the end of the theater saying ""Ooooooooooohhh, that's cool"".Where ""Into The Woods"" fell short. Being the fact that it was a musical, I would expect the music to be more ""Oh man I love this, this is beautiful and well made!"" But as I was watching the movie, I found that a lot of the music and dialogue was actually pretty ""annoying"". Now, I have a severe case of music appreciation. Being one who loves to sing and loves hearing creative music, I had high hopes for the music in this film. But in general, I was fairly disappointed. There were problems with the plot, where it felt rather simplistic or lazy at times. Throwing a dilemma into the fray, then immediately solving the problem within a thirty second window. ""Into The Woods"" had moments where it not only felt simple, it almost felt random. I kept finding myself full of a strange sense that really, stuff was just sort of happening. In general, I kept thinking to myself ""I don't know if I can continue to watch this."" And by the time I stopped thinking this, the movie was over.How ""Into The Woods"" was able to solve some of its problems. The music seemed to, as it went on, get better and felt like it was improving. Also, the music that I found ""annoying"" I noticed I was actually reciting more than anything else as I was exiting the theater. The plot, being ""simplistic and random"" actually did have a really strong concept that I found interesting. I couldn't figure out if the execution was just falling short at moments, or if I was just missing some small piece about the movie that made it hard for me call it ""complex and satisfactory"". All the characters were perfectly well casted and made it that much easier to keep me in the theater. And lastly, there was thing that I did appreciate. And that was the attempted balance between singing and dialogue. Yes, it's a musical, but if you make it into a movie, you need to have at least a small balance between the music and movie. Giving it the movie personality with the dialogue it should use, and giving it the musical feel it needs with the performances (sorry ""Les Misérables"").As a movie, ""Into The Woods"" falls short of what I would've liked to have expected. It's a piece that I don't completely regret seeing the first time, but would most likely not see again. As a musical however, ""Into The Woods"" seems like it would've been performed better on stage, rather than the big screen. ""Into The Woods"" is better in the musical prospective, rather than it is in the movie prospective. Giving it the boost that it truly needs. Final Score: 5/10 (this review score is based on the MOVIE. As a musical, I could give this a 6.5/10).",Into the Woods

282,bschultz_the_pally,Grade: C+,6,6 January 2015,"Into the Woods is easily the biggest musical this year, and with Disney having picked it up, it was certain to have been given a grand treatment. But it faces a paradoxical flaw that doomed it from the get-go; Disney did it. The problem with Disney doing Sondheim's musical is that it's a satire of the fairy tales that Disney has produced time and time again, utilizing all their best characters and using the exact situations to ironically point out a lot of the ridiculousness and unrealistic expectations that come with them. Perhaps Rob Marshall didn't want to upset the mega-corporation providing his paycheck, but there are too many lines to count that don't hit the right notes.Musically, most of the vocals are spot on, though Anna Kendrick and even Meryl Streep go sharp in a few moments. The sound mix underneath is unfortunately less than impressive. Many of the lip-syncs are obvious and the orchestration at times is too quiet. Thankfully, the orchestration doesn't overpower the vocals, and many of the songs actually sound very good. Stand-out songs include ""It Takes Two"", ""Stay With Me"", ""On The Steps of The Palace"", ""Any Moment"", ""No One Is Alone"", and the ""Finale"". ""Agony"" deserves a special mention for capturing the spirit of the play. In the original show, it is a hilarious song for the two princes to boost each other's egos by stroking their own, and Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen nail it. These actors are cast very well, as are Anna Kendrick as Cinderella; Daniel Huttlestone as Jack; and Emily Blunt as The Baker's Wife, who gives a charming and vocally spectacular performance.Unfortunately, it's hard to speak for the rest of the cast. Many have moments, sure; James Corden has good comedic chemistry with Emily Blunt, and really shines in ""It Takes Two"" and ""No One Is Alone"", but that is again, with Emily Blunt. On his own, he is forgettable. Meryl Streep starts off surprisingly weak; her performance of the ""Witch's Rap"" lacks menace and wit, but she redeems herself in key dramatic songs throughout the film. Lilla Crawford is flat in her take on Little Red Riding Hood, and miscast. Lucinda and Florida and Cinderella's stepmother are too stereotypically evil to be fun, and have too little screen time to be memorable at all. Mackenzie Mauzy also gets very little screen time, but does well with her scenes.Last but not least, Johnny Depp gives a great but also restrained performance as The Wolf. ""Hello Little Girl"" is one of the most disappointing numbers of the bunch, but not because of Johnny Depp, whose cool vocals give an interesting take on the song; rather, it is the director's approach to the number that ruins it. The song, simply put, alludes to pedophilia, and clearly, Disney hoped kids would miss all the double-entendres if it weren't sung that way.This is why Disney should have not handled the film. Into the Woods is not just a satire of fairy tales, but a commentary of real and dark things; pedophilia, cannibalism, fertility, loyalty, marriage, abandonment, and death. Disney attempts to weave its way through serious issues by simply watering them down, which is very apparent considering lots of little things are cut, and is perhaps why many of the performances seem bland. It's uncomfortable for older audiences because anything real is presented in a dismissive, kid-friendly manner, and it's a shade too dark and complex for younger audiences.What's most upsetting about Into the Woods is that it suffers most in the areas the count the most; the direction, the story, the sound, and the editing as well. ""Giants In The Sky"" would have benefited from some cut- aways of Jack in the giant's house, a feat that can be easily be achieved on film and not on stage.Where the movie does shine most is in its look. Though there are a few random shaky cam shots, most of the camera movements are smooth, and the lighting is dazzling. The production design is also sharp, particularly in its practicality. I was also fond of the second act, which surprised me because Sondheim completely lets loose here and defeats his own play in the writing. All the nuances and ironies of fairy tales are done away with in favor of cold and direct destruction of characters, yet the film adaptation pulls it off with grace. Perhaps it is because it is lacking the subtext, and Into the Woods instead focuses on themes that Disney prefers: family, friendship, and love, even if it's taught through loss. Giants descend from the heavens to wipe out the kingdom, and the characters come together to bring them down. Though it's much darker in the play, Disney finds the light in the darkness, and it reflects cinematically. Between the camera-work, production design, fairly impressive vocals, and splashes of humor throughout, audiences are most likely to feel engaged until act two. For audiences who don't know the show, it'll feel overlong and darkly deceiving. For fans of the show, it just might be their cup of tea. Still, I believe all audiences will feel underwhelmed by the bigger picture. Into the Woods is one of the funniest, boldest, and most complex musical satires of our time, and perhaps there will one day be a film adaptation that truly captures that, but this isn't it.",Into the Woods
283,jalvarad,"""Children"" movie with disdain for structure",3,27 December 2014,"This is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. It started by intertwining a collection of well known fairy tales, which are characterized by having happy endings. The musical aspect of the movie commands respect; however, its dramatic structure is very loose and incoherent, especially in the last 45 minutes of it.The movie introduces adult themes like infidelity, death, justified killing, which are probably more apt for a different genre, but not for a children movie during the Christmas season (parents watch out). It also difficult to understand why the fairy tale nature of the movie was so distorted near the end of it. The cast members are true professionals, who should have challenged the director and screenwriter every day of production (just like Alec Guinness did when working with David Lean); otherwise, they should have rejected the roles out of respect for the genre.In summary, the movie is a bit hard to follow because it is rather incoherent and badly edited, which should not be expected from Disney.

I had never looked into the story but LOVE Meryl Streep and many of the other actors and am so glad I saw it. The storyline was great, reminded me a little of ""WICKED"" as far as the type of story. I have seen the musicals Wicked,Phantom, Jersey Boys and Mama Mia all on New Yorks Broadway stages and I have to say this movie could hold up against them pretty well which is hard for a movie to do against a live performance. So I would definitely recommend this film,unless you don't like musicals perhaps! It was very well directed and edited, I would say, since I see a TON of movies in the course of a year. Perhaps a bit too intense for smaller children but I loved how the fairy tales were interwoven. There were a LOT of lessons in the story of which we should all pay attention to which is probably why I thought of the Wicked storyline as I was watching it, not that it is the same, but a similar theme.",Into the Woods

At the end of the movie, she said ""that was one weird movie"". Trust me - this movie is not for kids. This is an anti-fairy tale movie .. a nightmare for movie goers.Spoilers: Now if they just cut the movie and ended the wedding of Cinderella, this would have been great. But no, they proceeded to do these horrible things: 1) Cinderella's prince and Cinderella separated after they got married because the Prince is a Playboy. And he had sex with a baker's wife (Emily Blunt). WTF2) Emily Blunt's character underwent hard work to get the witch's spell taken out, so she could have a baby. And after she delivered the baby, she had sex with the Prince of Cinderella in the Woods. And you'd think her character was in love with her husband and they wanted a child so badly, then she has sex thing with the Prince. WTF.3) Then Emily Blunt's character gets lost in the forest and falls and dies, just right after she had her kid. WTF ?4) Myrle Streep's Witch character broke her spell and got her 'youth' back. It was all good. Then, she gets sucked into a quicksand and dies. WTF. 5) The Baker never got to meet her long lost sister Rapunzel. The movie leaves many things hanging. They should just have the Witch get the Baker and her sister together at the end.6) Jack's mother dies (as in Jack and the Beanstalk). She had a stroke. WTF ? 7) Cinderella goes back to being poor. Red Riding Hood becomes an orphan with her grandma dead. And they go with the baker in the end, and that's the stupid ending. They practically killed half the cast. It is the worst movie ever. The writer of this movie is 'anti-fairy-tale' as if to say. There's no fairy tale - Cinderella dumps her prince, the Baker (the protagonist of the story) has his wife killed in the woods looking for Jack, Jack's mother dies, the Witch (who was converted at last to a good looking lady) also got killed off. Really? Worst movie ever.I'm 100% positive that Disney paid several people here to rate it 7 - 10. There are hundreds of paid reviewers here for Disney, saving it's the best movie ever. Do not every trust these people.",Into the Woods
286,isaacglover_05,Warning! This is a musical!,6,19 January 2015,"Half the hate reviews I'm seeing on this website are all saying ""The trailers didn't announce that it was a musical"". 1. The music in the trailer is the character's singing voices! Please pick up on that! 2. Yes, it is a musical. I really don't see how a movie can get so much hate just because they didn't know it was a musical! At least try to appreciate the music in it instead of just hating it because you don't like actual singing. 3. THIS WAS ORIGINALLY BASED ON A STAGE PLAY BACK IN THE 80'S, OF COURSE IT IS GOING TO BE FREAKING LONG! Honestly the people act as if they've never sat through a 2 hour movie before! Schindler's List was over 3 hours and that is a freaking masterpiece, but god forbid a musical being just over two hours. 4. If you came in to just see Johnny Depp: Stop being so stupid and be warned he's only in the movie for 5 minutes. 5. IT'S PG-13! It warns you that some scenes will frighten young children. However if you think that the movie version is disturbing then don't take your kids to the stage play! In my opinion. I loved this version just as much as the stage play. I have high hopes for Lilla Crawford and that she gets more roles in other movies. Her voice was phenomenal and Stephen Sondheim's musicals are a bit of a challenge to play in. So my respects to her. Anna Kendrick's voice was amazing, and she played a brilliant Cinderella. Meryl Streep is brilliant as always. Emily Blunt had a hidden talent I wasn't aware of. The two men (forgot the names sorry) who played the two prince's had great voices too! I could go through the cast and break down on their talent, but I think I'd go over the 1, 000 word count. But please be warned, this is a musical. I believe it is a great musical and I really want others to give it a chance. It sucks that that the rating is 6.6 and I'm afraid it will get lower :( 10/10",Into the Woods
287,Breitschleif,"A good adaptation of a fantastic musical, the rating does not do it justice.",8,3 October 2016,"I enjoyed the movie a lot, it has been many years since i saw ""Into the Woods"" as a live musical and the film was a nice reminder of why i loved the story so much back then and still do.In short: It's DEFINITELY not for everyone and i think that is reflected in the very harsh, partially unjust ratings and comments. The adaptation is very close to the original and executed beautifully though and fans will have a good time watching it.If you enjoyed the original musical or ""dramatic comedy musicals"" in general then i recommend watching it. If you expect some Tim Burton-esque ""Alice through the Looking Glass"" film you will be disappointed because that is NOT what this is despite what the trailer might suggest.8/10 but i understand that it is only enjoyable for a very specific audience (and definitely not for kids or most teens!).",Into the Woods
288,benkarkis,Overwrought Borefest,1,2 December 2018,"Just tried to watch on Showtime. Couldn't make it. This is a classic Hollywood situation where the Director and the Cast believe they are so damn good and talented and a ""great musical"" that how could anything be wrong. My god, we have Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, Chris Pine, annoying child actors, James Corden, Johnny Depp, we have to be great.Bottom line, the movie never ends and every song starts to sound the same.",Into the Woods
289,YoungCriticMovies,Into the Looong Woods: A Film that is Ruined By An Elongated Ending,7,13 January 2015,"There is a difference between an opera and a musical. A musical has intermittent songs, and an opera has intermittent dialogue. Into the Woods seemed to not know the difference, it called itself a musical, but it had scarce dialogue. While this could have easily been ignored, the identical songs and music caused for the ""musical"" to be droning. I only managed to distinguish two songs from the rest. As for the story, it was all fine and enjoyable until the final act, which seemed as if the studio had forced Stephen Sondheim, writer of the original musical for Broadway, to add a final act to his ""musical"" causing the ending to seem forced, lazy, and rushed.Into the Woods mixes many of the classic fairy tales such as Little Red Riding Hood (first timer Lilla Crawford) and the wolf (Johnny Depp), Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) and her prince (Chris Pine), Jack (Les Miserables' Daniel Huttlestone) and the beanstalk, and Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy). All the fairy tales are stringed together when a baker (Begin Again's James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) are tasked to get an item from each of these famous characters in order to lift a curse on them that a witch (Meryl Streep) created, preventing them from having children.All the technical aspects are thrilling, from the set and costumes to the makeup and even the CGI. In fact the editing was incredibly astounding in the first 20 minutes with fast, fluid, and dizzying cuts that made one admire the freedom in cinema. However, as time went on the creativity faded and the editing ended up being much more straightforward and conventional, something that disappointed me a little.The acting is notable too. James Corden is finally given his big break after he bursts in his role in Begin Again. He is pushed to his limits acting and singing, but even so he is able to excel in both. Meanwhile Meryl Streep surprises us again, you'd think we'd be used to it after 18 Oscar nominations (including three wins). Streep actually plays her first witch in Into the Woods, and her singing capabilities shown in Mama Mia! are elevated as she showers us with an outstanding voice and performance. As for Emily Blunt, she also shines by being one of the few that takes her role seriously, unlike Chris Pine who sought to survive his role through humor. Anna Kendrick and Johnny Depp have roles a little too small to properly analyze them, but even so they seemed to be having fun.The problem with the film was its conclusion. About three fourths of the way into the film it seems to all be wrapping up perfectly and enjoyably, but the film seeks to overly exert its originality and in doing so it bores and drags its audience to the finish line. The film's last quarter ends up being eternal and with uninteresting twists. Such a shame that such an original idea could be marred with a simple 25% of the film.The film starts off with much energy and promise, but as time goes by one can almost see that the actors, editors, and even director wanted to just get the film over with and get on with something else. Too similar to what the audience feels like watching the film.",Into the Woods
290,hounds_star,Way too Much singing - and too often to the same melody!,4,13 January 2015,"This film has a great cast who all play their parts well. The storyline is a bold attempt to intermix several fairy tales together and develop them further. Although this can be interesting at times, there are also moments when things jar a bit - like there being 6 magic beans that grow into bean stalks.I don't mind musical films, especially with good songs that are sung well. Sadly, although the cast did sing well, most of the songs were very boring because they frequently used the same melody (were you being lazy Stephen Sondheim?), and eventually became extremely aggravating. The lyrics were tight and sometimes clever - although the odd word or two did make me wince. This was because Mr Sondheim's lyrics were written in doggerel style, so occasionally a jarring word would be used just to make it fit the rhythm and rhyme and the frequent use of this couplet rhyming device just added to the tedium. It may be that Mr Sondheim thought it would be clever to imitate the way Rupert the Bear stories were told - I don't know - but for me it grated, especially when new lyrics were persistently sung (often by another character) to the same tune yet again as the story progressed! There eventually came a point in he film which seemed to be a much sought after and natural end but alas it was not to be and the whole thing carried on ... and on ... and on. The film was much too long.On the positive side I will say that the colours, costumes and sets were pleasing. As was the use of some of the original parts of fairy stories that have often been removed so as not to upset little ones e.g. cutting the ugly sisters feet to make them fit the slipper. Johnny Depp also made a very convincing wolf who was both sleazy and threatening.Overall the whole film was quite dark but for me the very best part - and really the only enjoyable part - was the song battle between the two princes which was performed precariously in amongst the rocks on a shallow waterfall. Now that scene will stay in my mind and make me smile for some time to come - but it was not worth me sitting through all the rest for.Would children enjoy it? I am not convinced any children of any age will. My experience of children is that they like familiarity, so that this film's reinvention of their favourite tales might annoy or disappoint,rather than please. The persistent, monotonous singing certainly annoyed me - and it bored the hell out of me too!",Into the Woods
291,chilichilipepper,An Honest Review,5,18 January 2015,"Having not seen the musical, maybe I am missing something. However I think that it is hilarious that the first 3 pages are all one star reviews and of course use the most overused phrase ""WORST MOVIE EVER"". According to IMDb Reviewers, there sure are a lot of worst movies ever.Is this the worst movie ever? Of course not. That's a term that comes with no information and is about as strong as a statement as I really didn't like it. Thankfully, IMDb's rating system weeds out these types of reviews when trying to get a more accurate score of the movie. For me, It was a so / so movie. (Hence the 5 rating, not good, not bad, just there.The main gripe I had with the movie is I really did not care at all about the characters. Considering I've read that the play is a huge hit and has won awards, I'm guessing they cut a lot of the character development out of the film. Really, even the Baker and Wife didn't feel like the central characters. They felt like the Macguffin to drive the rest of the film along.Second, the songs were well written, and in most cases the singing was good enough for the performances, however some of the songs just didn't make sense in context with the movie (again, I'm guessing that this is due to cuts to the musical, probably so Disney could get the PG rating). I am guessing that the musical is much darker and violent than the movie before it was Disneyfied.Finally, it appeared that they were looking for big name actors and a star studded cast instead of looking for actors that could pull off the roles more effectively. It was obvious which actors had stage experience and which didn't, and it was kind of distracting to watch the two different forms collide. One scene would have someone that obviously performs on Broadway followed up by a scene with Chris Pine trying to pretend that he's done a Broadway musical. In general, the casting was just a mess.Again, I can't compare it to the actual musical because I haven't seen it. But overall, this movie had some moments that were entertaining, some scenes that made no sense, mediocre to decent acting, no character development, and in general, feels like a LOT of the original play was cut so Disney would publish it and get their sweet spot PG rating to grab those ""fairytale dollars"" from children and parents. This feels more like ""The Phantom of the Opera"" with Gerald Butler (IE barely like the stage version that I have seen), but no where close to Mamma Mia!(another that i've seen).So my recommendation, wait until it's on Netflix or Hulu or whatever. Or just rent it at home for the 3.99$ when it comes out streaming. Wasn't a horrible movie, but is NOT worth the price that movie theaters charge nowadays. Honestly, it probably would have been cheaper to go watch the real musical, which I suspect is MUCH better.",Into the Woods
292,flowertimezones,A Disney film gone bad,4,6 January 2015,"The first half of this film was wonderful. The storyline, singing, and integrated stories made for easy viewing. The story moves quickly and is easy to understand. All looks happy in this developing forest wonderland. Then for some inexplicable reason, the movie takes a really wrong turn. It slips into adult territories of murder, adultery, and abandonment (with adultery being the most noticeable and egregious. The prince declares himself ""Charming"" but not ""Sincere"" as makes his moves on another woman.) The hunt to kill the giant seems too premeditated and the songs at the end are annoyingly long and boring. It was like torture watching the last 1/2 hour. My kids of 14 and 10 weren't sure what to make of it, but I know they enjoyed the first half as I did. This would never be a movie that I would recommend and certainly not one that I would buy on DVD.",Into the Woods

It's quite long for children, a bit creepy (I know kids cope with more than you think!) and contains very mixed moral messages. For example, they talk about not getting revenge on a character, have a whole song about it, and then carry on with plans to kill another character after a comment that ""it doesn't feel right"", which is brushed aside, saying that mothers don't know everything! For adults, there are some very funny bits but then some dull bits where a song has just been stuffed in to try and make a moral point (we're better together, no one is alone). I've never seen the show it's based on so can't comment on whether this is just the original script. Johnny Depp as the wolf was very creepy and I can't believe the wolf's song is allowed!

Les Miserable was amazing and I still enjoy The Sound of Music --- but this was horrible. I was bored stiff ten minutes into the show. The music and singing is monotonous. The melody may change from song to song, but the cadence never does! It's like listening to a metronome for two hours. My wife and I rented it and I refused to shut it off because I'm proud of the fact that I've only ever walked out of one movie in my life --- but this tested my fortitude. About 45 minutes left in the show my wife started fast-forwarding past the monotonous singing and stopped only when it appeared plot development was occurring. The movie was, in the end, a complete waste of 2 hours of our lives, second only to the 1978 Star Wars Christmas Special. I gave it two stars instead of one for only two reasons: it was a surprise that Meryl Streep could sing (and reasonably well) and Anna Kendrick is beautiful.

This is so close to the origins. I favorite a red riding hood, because she is brave and funny. If you like a fairy tale, maybe you will have fun while watching this film.

Streep is in excellent voice. There are some things lost in the move to film (the more comic elements get toned down too much, for example - thankfully there's still ""Agony""), and some things brought into sharper focus.What I cannot believe about this movie is the number of people taking young children to it. Seriously, people? The trailers were not that misleading, creating a sense of foreboding that telegraphs the darkness of this musical.

I was very much looking forward to going to Pizza Hut with my other half and our 3 year old daughter, and then to the cinema to watch this massive celluloid mistake. It's kind of ruined my birthday.Firstly, I don't really need to write much because everything I wanted to write has already been written in other reviews on here. I love films, enough to of done a degree in Film studies, and I haven't got any issues with musicals - my favourite film of all time is Little Shop of Horrors. But, quite simply, Into the Woods does not contain any good songs and the film makes no sense whatsoever.My daughter has been brought up to respect, concentrate and discuss films. The last film she saw at the cinema was 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and she was mesmerised the whole way through and has not stopped talking about it ever since.

I read the cinematic reviews beforehand which were less than complimentary - but decided to go to the film with an unbiased view.What I assumed would be the first half of the play - i.e. the set up of the various stories of 'into the woods' was entertaining. Merryl Streep was entertaining in her role as witch, and the story developed reasonably well. Ten minutes into the what I assumed would be the second half of the play i.e. after the intermission, I was looking for the exit door. It was painful, slow, and tedious. Far too long dealing with polite conversation across actors passing a baby from one actor to another with an irritating interplay between an Americanized perception of a London accent delivered by Jack supplemented by an irritating American twang by little red riding hood. The combination didn't work in Mary Poppins - so there was no reason to suppose that the combination would still work some 50 years later.The scene in which Jonny Depp played cameo as the wolf in the first half with little red riding hood - implied a great deal of sexual innuendo - which may be the origins of the fairy tale - but in 2015 we have laws against 'coming on' to minors - and so this aspect was uncomfortable and looked out of place. Little Red Riding Hood should have been played by a somewhat older individual to move with the current times.Hence 2/10 - not one of Disney's shining performances.",Into the Woods
303,talentgirl,Took me in! In a good way!,7,17 December 2016,"When I first saw that it was on at the cinema, I thought it was going to be a horror movie, or something like the Blair Witch Project: the title picture with Meryl Streep (who I didn't even recognise at the time) looked a bit too scary for me (I don't watch horrors).It was only some time later that I realised that it was Meryl Streep and I decided I would one day watch it. When some kids who I knew asked me if I had seen it (though they themselves were really too young to have done so), I decided it was time. I, too, did not know it was a musical. It became clear straight away, though, and I was okay with that, but agreed that if my hubby was not, then we would turn it off after ten minutes and watch something else.I loved it, though he fell asleep (not necessarily because of the movie, possibly in spite of it - he was just tired, I think.) Anyway, the movie was good. Musicals have more of a battle to sell themselves. Are the songs good? Is the singing good? Is the cast engaging and charismatic? I found the songs to be complex and interesting - well-crafted word play with narrative relevant to the plot. My only negative comment: it felt a bit over-long. I would have been okay with it finishing before the final act but I realised there was a plot twist and another story to be told. After watching the film, I read the reviews and saw it was based on a successful Broadway show and I give the film credit for being so well done that it could stand alone like it did.Some reviewers said the singing was bad. Not so. All the cast sang well. Not all sung dialogue in a musical is meant to sound like a pop song. I enjoyed this movie. Give it a watch now you know that it is a musical, if you didn't before. If you like a good plot performed by a committed, skilled cast, you should like this. 7/10.",Into the Woods

While I understand the moral fiber of the USA is changing dramatically, we (or should I say 'I') still expect a certain wholesome quality from Disney.

Every character is at least good, several are deeply moving, the spare CGI works, and the source material survives. Stephen Sondheim can rest assured. Legit theater fanatics can stick with the imagination of the stage; this movie version shares the concept with a much bigger audience.

307,anchor-9,Just don't go into the woods looking for Disney,9,10 October 2015,"Into The Woods suffers from a misconception that it is a Disney fairytale. What it is, is a film adaptation of a Sondheim stage musical.Modern, dark and ironic would be more accurate descriptors. But it stands up on its own. Its tale is hectic; an interwoven musical performance with each character from separate fairy tales venturing into the woods ready to clash. While they see their wishes come true,the adage ""be careful what you wish for"" holds true as well.The adaptation fails to set the same tone between light granting of wishes and dark dystopia achieved by the musical's break between acts - my only real complaint.The cast is excellent; some of the musical numbers probably wear thin for Disney trained ears but the more mainstream ones are great. Kudos to Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen (Prince Charming and Rapunzel's Prince) for a very satirical rendition of 'Agony' that sees the brothers beating on their chests trying to one-up each other repeatedly. And of course to Meryl Streep is THE the witch of all ages. Definitely to be enjoyed if you have any idea of what you are looking for in the woods.",Into the Woods
308,Icecreambenjaminelliott,One of the Greatest Musicals of All Time Massacred,1,6 July 2019,"It's absolutely tragic to me to see so many reviews say that the score is boring or unmemorable. This is one of the greatest musical theatre scores of all time. The music is beautiful, fun, and odd and the lyrics are complex, poetic, and beautiful. Stephen Sondheim is the greatest musical theatre composer and this is one of his best works. James Lapine's original musical book is also phenomenal. It's hysterical, dark, scary, emotional, and tragic.The casting here is good, for the most part. Meryl Streep is perfect as The Witch, a role created by the great Bernadette Peters. Emily Blunt is lovely, but occasionally misses the comedic nature of her role. The kids who play Jack and Little Red are wonderful. Anna Kendrick is positively awful. She doesn't capture the neurotic and manic demeanor that this version of Cinderella requires. She also doesn't have the pretty operatic soprano that the role is written as. James Corden just doesn't work for me. He's just not right for the role. Most of the rest of the cast is pretty take it or leave it.The direction and design here is atrocious. The film is ugly, garish, filled with plastic looking CGI. It also tries it's hardest to be as Disney as possible. The musical is scary and violent. The violence is skipped over here which hurts the story. The darkness comes off as false and the whole second act is destroyed. The entire heart of the film has been ripped out and stomped on. The musical makes me weep at the end. This film made me feel absolutely nothing. It's some of the worst adapting of material that I have ever seen.This needed an artsy team that would embrace the black comedy, darkness, and beauty of the musical. Disney could not have been a worse pick to produce this.Hopefully we'll get a remake in 10 years or so.",Into the Woods

I'm short on the history, but some reviews fault the movie for its morality. The film makers have their own views on morality. The truest review should comment on how the film makers transferred their morality, regardless of what it is, to the screen.Others say they hate the score. That's hardly an indictment of the film. The score exists independently and prior to the film. The film was amazing. Rob Marshall did a great job with CHICAGO. But this was so much better. The pace is absolutely perfect. I've been watching it over and over trying to figure out how he did it. He magically leads the viewer from scene to scene flawlessly. And there are so many plots he's weaving together.What about the cinematography. If you don't like the score or the morality, turn the sound off and look at it as pure beauty.And is this not the best adaptation of a Sondheim work? The creators of SWEENEY TODD didn't have enough faith in the piece to be true to the original. A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC of course was a disaster. Is there anyone who thinks this deserves only one star who wouldn't upgrade it after taking in consideration -- as part of the whole -- Meryl Streep's performance?This film takes the content and amplifies it. That makes it great. I must caution viewers not to read the reviews of those who take exception to the content. The content has been vetted on Broadway.

And these are just about all good things I can mention about this movie. Then you begin to notice that the catchy tune is annoyingly repetitive and could be heard all thorough the movie in every song. A good musical should have at least three or two good songs. But this one hasn't got any that you'd like to whistle after you leave the theater. As soon as characters' paths in the film start to intersect, lots of pointless stories begin to develop and none makes any sense, no character gets any anticipation. Film gets weirder and weirder. Plot line doesn't have certain direction, it goes all over the place, in this case all over the woods. Then you get fed up with all this nonsense going on, stop caring what happens to whoever on the screen. There are also disturbing moments. When Mr. Wolf meets Red Riding Hood. I don't know how to put that politely, but at one point, Johnny Depp's character seems like, he's trying to make pass at Red. Excuse me but this is repulsive. It seems like this scene is designed especially for satisfying some pedophile's dream. And believe me this is not the worst moment, gets worse. Some following scene, Baker takes of Red's hood, and as leaving her alone in the woods he kisses her on the cheeks. Creepy. If you hadn't seen it yet, I recommend staying away.",Into the Woods
313,Franco_Strydom,Culturally confused with an overly complicated narrative.,5,5 January 2015,"I believe some of the best narratives are complicated in its story but simple in its telling. If an audience needs to start looking for reasons as to why a film was produced then the narrative has failed and in this sense ""Into the Woods"" (Marshall 2014) fails. The difference in the accents of the cast is incredibly distracting; American, Standard English, and British all in the mix making it an effort to immerse yourself in the fantastical location of the film.The narrative starts out easy to watch and standard with regards to expectations for a fairy-tale themed musical. The way the different traditional stories flow into one another is enticing and some of the characters have unexpected personalities, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The hand costuming/prosthetics for the Wolf and the Witch are disappointing though. Hands are important, especially when you're working with music; people gesture and strike poses, and spotting something like prosthetics in those moments spoil them. It did however remind me of theater and I would love to see the stage production as it does feel like it belongs to theater more than to film – being based on a theater text that's understandable but as this comes across in the acting it becomes a weakness to the film.What makes you realize that the film is just over two hours long is how the musical changes pace. The first third of the film is all but constant singing intertwining scenes and stories with music and melodies, the second third is lots of singing but less lased from scene to scene and more short aria style pieces and the last third of the film actually has minimal singing and songs seem reserved for all the pinnacle moments. Besides the change in pace and disconnected feeling this gives the narrative, the final third of the film still has the actors acting out in a theatrical and musical styled movement which is over the top and communicative but not at all believable. When people are singing everything the overly theatrical movements hardly bothers you but when everything becomes more dramatic and lines are delivered as dialog it starts feeling awkward and un-cinematic.The darker twist to the story comes out of nowhere and is very suburban for a fairy tale. Around the same time the already complicated narrative is made even more complicated by taking what the audience knows of the different fairy tales and what they've been setup to expect (by the story itself) and completely changing direction with it; quite ineffectively. It could have reached much of the same results by sticking to its guns and riding out the fairy tale story it was shaping up to be.The sound – beyond the accents – constantly draws your ear's attention as it sounds like you're listening to an album and not a film. The quality is great and the vocalists are, for the most part, quite pleasing but it sounds flat stereo when characters are singing and the soundscape takes a definite back seat to the music and singing. On one or two occasions the ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement – recording the sound after the fact) didn't synch up quite too well with the studio recording; so you can hear the characters and how they're singing in a studio while watching them travel through a forest at a distance.Scene for scene the film is effective and the production value is well worth spending the ticket money on. The cast is well picked and very enjoyable even with some of the theater acting. Overall, the narrative pulls the film down to a slight disappointment.",Into the Woods
314,cartoonheart45,Strangely Enjoyable!,6,20 March 2015,"The first thing I've ever watched that was totally ruined by expectations, people waited for a plane Disney story with perfect adorable characters expressing themselves through singing. Everyone thought that they will be narrating the same historical stories but with a refreshing, modern way keeping the ""Happy ending"" stamp. It was a quiet disappointment for most of the viewers since it was ironically send to children when having content totally unacceptable for most of children like the charming prince that wasn't taught to be sincere and had the reputation of a charmer. The ""into the woods"" theme was presented as a chaotic place where logic and reason don't rule and leave an open space for wild emotions and spontaneity and that was exactly proved in the story. When I was watching the movie, I found myself attached more to the Cinderella scenes since it was the story that gets me most. I was waiting for details, small details that I liked in every Cinderella movie like the dancing scene. I was looking for more from Johnny Depp. But I was pleased by the baker and his wife and how they made a strong bond between the whole characters. Those two were quiet full of pleasant surprises and bad ones too. The movie was unusual, surprising, and breath-taking at some parts, made me very curious about the end. I don't see that it was very rough for children comparing it to fellow Disney movies of this generation. I might even go farther by saying that this movie was less painful that most of Today Disney's movies. Most people were slapped by the reality, cruelty built inside some characters that are maybe hard to process but eventually, the story had good lessons and enjoyable moments. It was kind of weird to see such an attempt from a Disney movie. Otherwise it was a pleasure.",Into the Woods

Sometimes she's nice, comic and even vulnerable and in other moments philosophical and terrible. This mark that both the heroes and villains alike have their own problems and daydreams highlights the universality inherent in this work and therefore makes it special. ""I was raised to be charming, not sincere."" said by the prince is the best note.Despite being only 5min Johnny Depp doesn't cease to deserve our congrats on his wolf role. As for the soundtrack, I think ""Agony"" is the most excels. A good duet and a waterfall in the background. However, the last part is a disappointment. The dark present throughout the work simply disappears. One feels that something is missing, that is incomplete, lost.In this world, where a happy ending is a utopia, I think ""Into the Woods"" is a pleasant sight.",Into the Woods
316,rich-66,This was supposed to be a PG-rated musical?,1,1 January 2015,"I was always of the impression that in a film in the musical category, most, if not all of the singers would be fairly decent singers. ""Into the Woods"" is certainly the exception to this expectation. In this film we have some famous stars whose acting ability is unquestionable but whose vocal talents are severely challenged.Furthermore, the PG rating was a gratuitous bow to Disney. Cinderella's stepmother cuts a toe off of one daughter's foot and the heel off the other's so that they can attempt to squeeze into the shoe presented by the prince. That sound a lot like child abuse to me. Alas, there where few adults present to offer guidance to their children and their friends anyway whom had most likely been dropped at the theater to get them out of the parents way.Granted, fairy tales were (are) a means of teaching life lessons to children. Under the surface, quite a few are violent and scary especially for young children. But what is the lesson one can take home from this film? Disney is a large corporation whose sole purpose is to make money anyway it can.I suggest parents should not send their children to see this film.",Into the Woods

318,mounthebron,Forgettable Music & Inane Lyrics,2,23 January 2021,"I have no idea why anyone thinks either the original play and by extension this movie adaptation is good. Literally every song is completely vanilla & forgettable before you even walk out of the theater. Seriously, there's no danger any of these songs will ever get stuck in your head. Accompanying the lifeless ""melodies"" are the most vapid lyrics you ever heard where the characters I guess are supposed to utter every single uninteresting thought that comes into their head, something like, ""So I'll bake some bread, then sweep the floor, and do some more mundane things, but suddenly now I need to go into the woooooooods"". No, those aren't actual lyrics, I just made them up, but they easily could be, especially because I made absolutely certain none of them rhymed as that might run the risk of being a little bit catchy.
Lastly, be sure to have every character unnecessarily repeat their lyrics 15 times, because this mashup of a half-dozen, one-dimensional fairytales you spend 5 minutes reading to children as bedtime stories needs SOMETHING to stretch it into 2 hours.If you really want to enjoy this movie I heartily recommend the ""Avatar"" method, which is to say visually it's really well done, so just turn the sound off while you play some music that is ACTUALLY good and time period relevant, for example the ""Princess Bride"" soundtrack, and then you can sit through this film and not feel like you wasted the last 2 hours.",Into the Woods
319,enekaith,Good acting... average story... acceptable music...not for children,4,8 January 2015,"This was a barely OK movie. What ruined it though were the too obvious lyrics and the struggle of the story. This is not a movie for kids but rather one that tries (horribly) to show and point out the loopholes of wishes and fairy tales and the fact that children always listen... even when you think they don't. One loophole was that the FarAway Prince was Charming, but dishonest. Other loopholes were stressing, with bad taste, the differences between being good and being nice, playing the blame game, etc. The fact i was able to deduct all that from the movie was truly a feat because it's not what children would expect. Were they trying to lecture children or adults? Was adultery supposed to be bad or good? Whatever the case may be, the cast was awesome, the story needed more clarity in the message they tried to get across, albeit haphazardly. The only saving grace of the movie was the Rapunzel story.",Into the Woods

In fact the announce of ""Into the woods"" made me happy and I just couldn't wait to watch it! In addiction I knew that Meryl Streep got her 19th nominations for the Academy Awards. I was out of my mind about watching this film! And yesterday I did First thought: It starts singing, I love it. Anna Kendrick. Oh she is really cool. I like her. Even Little red riding hood is a type. Meryl terrific like ever. Second thought: Let see how all of the stories fit together. The song are not very good but maybe they'll get better but Meryl Meryl is always perfect! Third thought: All seems to have a too much fast end. The character (Meryl a part) are not very well characterized. Still bad songs. Forth thought: I really like the metaphor of wood as life and witch as unexpected but this cannot be a reason to a chaotic development of stories and characters. In the end this is a cute story with a good cast. The main theme of the wood is fascinating and the witch is great but it seems to not bear all the other choices and characters of the movie. The whole picture is fragmented and in the musical part there isn't nothing noteworthy but the song ""The last midnight"".",Into the Woods
322,flarepunk,Excellent,10,21 January 2015,"I'm not entirely sure what people are thinking, but that's okay.For me, I had absolutely no expectations going into this film other than that it looked whimsical, and less like the gritty live-action fairy tales, such as Maleficent (which I hated, mostly). DURING the film, it took Little Red Riding Hood to stuff bread in her mouth and insist it was all for her granny for me to realize the tone this was going to set - and I was definitely on board.I enjoy an odd tone to films - and this one definitely had it. Whimsical, interesting, fun and playful, but not ignoring darker, more adult themes.These fairy tales WERE meant for children in the original form, their original, foreign-culture form. What we seem to have lost in our current society is any indication that children could HANDLE mature themes when put into the right context.Any adult themes were merely hinted at - the ONE exception perhaps being the Johnny Depp's Wolf character, which was still emphasizing flowers and candy, and not, well... 'flowers and candy' of another sort. I think the key factor is what you choose to emphasize in a film. If a director shows a bird darting for two women's eyes, and shows the up-close eyeball being plucked from the socket, blood spewing form the wound - okay, that some Final Destination crap that doesn't need to be in ANY film (not even in Final Destination), let alone a Disney film. The narration helps by telling us that the birds plucked out the eyes, and the daughters' feet were mutilated - which are things that happen in the original stories.This film was lovely, great fun, and has many great messages. I am somewhat saddened by Rapunzel not dying in this version, and I believe something was lost when the Baker never MEETS her, because they are siblings - but I see no reason to not show this movie to your children. Let them ask questions - explain things to them if they need it.This film proves to me Disney can be a little darker, more true to the original stories, and still be fun.",Into the Woods

My daughter was looking forward to this for months and to watch the happiness in her eyes turn to complete pain, boredom and sadness was such a shame. My two boys were in absolute agony twenty minutes in. As another reviewer has said, they only musical bit to stick with us was the two princes, i am sure it was meant to be comical, but just couldn't tell. Meryl was her usual blistering self, Depp, truly underused, the rest looked lost and frantic.

Imagine my surprise, then, when after a few minutes, the entire cast burst into some of the most uninspired, terrible lyrics I have ever heard, sung to some of the most melodically deficient and clashing tunes ever composed.The most enjoyable aspect of the movie was seeing Meryl Streep, Tracey Ullman and Christine Baranski in their roles, even if they occasionally also were forced to launch into completely forgettable song. Another writer has exuberantly praised the performance of Lilla Crawford; I must disagree, I think she has a very brassy, obnoxious voice which was more disconcerting than enjoyable. I found the intermingling of accents also completely absurd; the plot of this amalgam of fairy tales we all know is chronologically set in the Middle Ages, mostly in Europe. A British accent seems appropriate, but many of the actors were unable to affect anything beyond North American nasal twang, with Lilla Crawford being one of the worst offenders.Bottom line: If you are looking for a really awful musical based on throwing every fairy tale you can remember into the plot, then this is your movie. If you were expecting something more along the lines of Maleficent, stay away from this horrible offering.",Into the Woods

The songs are catchy, albeit, some seem to drag on, but it's a wonderful family movie, one that the kids will love and want to watch again and again.Many people didn't like the movie, however, I did quite enjoy it, even finding time to learn the lyrics after watching my first time to sing along for the next time I do watch. I do wish actors such as Johnny Depp and Chris Pine were in it more than they were, being a fan of both actors, but they did their characters justice. With promising acting from child stars Daniel Huttlestone (Jack) and Lilla Crawford (Red Riding Hood), one can only hope to see more from them in the future.Scoring a 7/10, I do recommend this movie, but only if you like original twists and musicals - otherwise it may be quite torturous.",Into the Woods

If I wasn't there with my girlfriend (who has sat through plenty of movies that she didn't enjoy), I would have walked out after the first scene. Instead, I got to witness the entirety of how bad this movie is.First of all, all of the characters were horrible, selfish, people. I didn't like one character. I wasn't pulling for anyone. There was no plot development. I was not wondering what would happen next and I didn't care. The plot was not interesting and it didn't pull me in. The costumes were done very poorly. Check the wolf's gloves. Speaking of the wolf, Johnny Depp was super-creepy and had even creepier lines toward Red Riding Hood. Yeah Yeah, I know everyone loves Meryl Streep. That's all I ever hear about W.R.T. this movie. OK, I'm sure she's a great actress and she may even have a great voice. Admittedly, I wouldn't know a good voice if it was right in front of me.The only reason I didn't give this one star, is because I'm sure the singing was great. Personally... whoop-de-do.... I heard so many people snoring during this movie. All I could think, was ""Ugh... Lucky!"" I wish I could have fallen asleep! Then, my time could have been used productively.This movie was clearly aimed at lonely house wives who grew up on Disney and are now hooked on Once Upon a Time. I'd rather watch the latter.

I do understand that this is a movie based on a Broadway musical play and to be honest that is where it should have stayed, on Broadway.Now, don't get me wrong, I don't hate all musicals/singing movies. I didn't mind the Pitch Perfect movies, but the songs in this movie were annoying. I just wanted to damage my eardrums to make it stop.Regardless, I persisted and was determined to make it to the end of the movie. I found that the only way to do that was to play online quizzes and have the movie as background noise (especially during the singing). It worked a treat, I made it to the end.Was very disappointed at the small role played by Mr Depp.One user on the message boards wrote, ""In case you missed the first three hours of this disaster.... Its called Into the wood into the wood into the wood into the wood.... If you can get beyond that tiresome opening song you'll probably love it...... "". That is rather accurate for the musical lovers out there.All in all, if you like musicals, this movie will probably float your boat immensely. If musicals are not your bag, it would be best to avoid it at all costs, your sanity will thank you for it.Considering the great cast and the sets, this movie probably would have been awesome if Tim Burton had made it, removed the singing, and then given it a dark sinister twist!!!",Into the Woods

Then the Prince ended up being a cheating Prince, it just went from bad to worse. I'm kind of shocked that Meryl Streep would be associated, although I have to say she did a great job. The acting wasn't a problem in the movie as it was great, but the story line was absolutely awful.

Fortunately, the witch, played by Meryl Streep, turns up and says that in order to have a child they'll have to get four things: the glass slipper from Cinderella; the red cape from Little Red Riding Hood; Rapunzel's hair and a cow from Jack and the Beanstalk. I thought this was a fun idea and had always wondered what it'd be like if fairy tales were to cross over each other. The songs were great and catchy, some of the characters fun and likable, and there were plenty of humorous moments that honestly had almost the whole cinema laughing and an ending I was not expecting at all which I won't spoil. I loved the casting: Meryl Streep is perfect as the witch, to be honest, I can't imagine anyone else as the witch; I loved James Corden and Emily Blunt as the baker and his wife, they had great chemistry together and Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, I've always thought she'd do well at playing a princess and I wasn't wrong.

By the halfway point, I thought the movie was over. It certainly felt like it had lasted an eternity. But no, it was only halfway done! I stopped paying attention after that, except for during Meryl Streep's last performance, which probably was the best part of the whole movie. At least she sang with feeling and conviction. By the end of the movie, I hardly cared what happened to the characters. The only reason I watched it to the end is because I hate leaving a movie unfinished.I've read some reviews and I think perhaps the Broadway version is better. At least I get the feeling that it handles the themes with more subtlety and nuance, which are two things you're unlikely to find in a Disney live action movie, and true to form you won't find them here.I really got my hopes up for this one because I saw some good reviews, but it wasn't for me.

What was Disney thinking by putting its name on this catastrophe? I also wonder about the parents who inadvertently brought their children to see this movie. What must they have thought? Were the children frightened, or more likely, confused? The beginning of the film seemed interesting. As each new character was introduced, each fairy tale thrown away in a poorly developed or more precisely undeveloped careless fashion, I couldn't keep watching it.

First of all, I did not even know ""Into the Woods"" was based on a Musical. I had no idea what the story was about, besides fairy tales. One of the main reasons I went to see it in the first place is because the trailer showed really cool special effects and costumes. It seemed overall that it would be an enjoyable film. I was really wrong. I knew there was some singing in it, but it turns out the film is basically ALL SINGING! There are a few lines here and there where the actors talk, and I thought I was in the clear,and then they start again and I just sat their rolling my eyes. The thing that made it even worse was that the songs were not even catchy! Most of the time, the actors were either shouting or complaining through the songs. All you can think is ""shut up already and get to the point!"" I do not think Disney should have attached themselves to this film. When I think of Disney, I think of amazing magical stories that I can actually enjoy, with some singing where the songs actually make sense with the story,and that you can listen to over and over again! Not what seemed like three hours of idiots walking around in the woods, only to have the most random, non satisfying ending. Not to mention the inappropriate/weird moments between characters that where not suitable for young children. There were two in particular that I could not believe where even included in the film. The interaction between little red riding hood and the PERVY wolf! I don't care what anyone says, the way he was singing, combined with lyrics and body language made him look like a pedophile...and it was really uncomfortable to watch.I kept thinking ""this is a joke, any minute they will end this torture and put on the really film"". Another scene that was so ridiculous and not needed was the sexual interaction between the bakers wife and Cinderella's Prince. I was looking forward to seeing Chris Pines, but his character in this is a sexual, stalking weirdo! Then to go and have them making out in the woods, with a song to accompany it was beyond ridiculous!!! There where families in the theater with kids under the age of 10 watching! I could go on forever but I will stop here. Bottom line is do not be fooled by the trailer. Do not go see this movie, save your money!

And I guess the movie was fine so long as you've never seen the 1991 video of the Broadway production of it which had far superior singers and actors. Meryl Streep is fine but she just wasn't anywhere near as good as Bernadette Peters.AND they cut out two of my favorite songs, ""No More"" and ""The Witch's Lament."" At first I could kind of understand cutting out ""No More"" because it's a fairly long song and they'd already cut out the character of the old man/his father. But the stuff they replaced the song with was almost as long as the song but not as good. And they sorta put the Witch's lament in there but since they cut out the whole part with Rapunzel dying and only put in part of the song, it pretty much lost all impact. They also cut out the narrator character, the reprise of ""Agony"", and my favorite scene wherein the characters violate the fourth wall and feed the narrator to the giantess to save themselves. So the producers and director of this movie took a really good musical and turned it into a mediocre film. Go find the 1991 video by American Playhouse and see how it is done right. There's very good reasons it has a rating of 8+ on IMDb while this movie barely manages an average of 6.",Into the Woods

It's trying to pass itself off as a musical but, really, just belting out lines at random notes does not a musical make. This isn't music, it's highly aggravating, ear-splitting CACOPHONY ... IT'S A FREAKING HEADACHE!! There isn't a single actual song ... it's all just, oh, let me take these (very badly written) lines and ""sing"" them ... and, believe me, the lines are CRINGE-WORTHY!!!! I can't comprehend how anyone could think this ""musical"" with its lack of actual music and its extremely juvenile dialogue (oh, yeah, and plot) was a good idea ... and then random cheating just out of nowhere, haha ... take that, little children ... life sucks, even in fairy tales, and now you know it ... by the way, you know Santa?? HE'S NOT REAL!! :D :D :D :D And the casting, ho ho ho, this is Cinderella like you've never seen her before. If it ever occurred to you that Anna Kendrick would make a TERRIBLE Cinderella, YOU WERE RIGHT, because she looks like a 12-year-old playing dress-up and it's very, very sad. And disturbing. Oh, and Rapunzel? Well, apparently she can control when to grow her lengthy tresses back, haha, because her hair returns IMMEDIATELY after the baker's wife cuts it off (to the point where the witch doesn't notice anything anything out of the ordinary) ... and then remains short when, later in the movie, the witch cuts it off!!!!!!

343,chinny-1982,"Terrible, just terrible.",2,6 April 2015,"Well, where to start..... The line-up had me really excited, a film with this many big names can't be bad. Or so I thought. The sets looked great and a few easily recognizable Grimm tales were set out early on, Little red Riding Hood, Cinderella and Rapunzel's handsome prince, among others, all head off as they do in their traditional stories and all encounter each other in a cartoon-like wood, along with a desperate childless baker couple played by Cordon and Blunt. All the characters appear together but their stories don't really seem to combine or intertwine (unless they did later on in the movie and I was just too bored to notice), the only real common ground they share is singing along to the same repetitive tune for the majority of the movie. After their stories had played out and the movie seemed to be coming to its natural and somewhat drawn out end an attempt at a twist occurs and the film drags on - at what point in time this happens I am not sure, frankly I am now starting to wonder if my local cinema is actually a TARDIS as I refuse to believe that this film was only two hours long, with not being able to check my phone and having no watch I was convinced that it was three hours plus. I give this film 2/10, 1 point for the cast and one for the set, but that is it. It's repetitive, boring, extremely long winded and rather pointless. I'm quite amazed that so many big names would sign up to do something so dull.",Into the Woods

It's a pity that i couldn't ask for my money back. Even the action movies made for a video release in Asia contains better material, music and story. The singing was from worse to worst, the scene where the prince took off his shirt...reminded me about David Coverdale, but not in that positive light. What about the Rapunzel...I suppose, even the Cuban(or North korean for example) movie industry can make something better.

It cut lots of the songs and made the ones they kept worse either by the horrible singing or the way they set it. The only songs I would consider okay are, on the steps of the palace and agony. They did one of the characters deaths horribly. The ending was genuinely the worst ending I have ever seen. The cgi was bad. I wouldn't show it to you're kids if they are young as it contains a bit of stuff about rape. I was expecting something as amazing as the musical but I was completely disappointed, seriously not even the acting is that good. It genuinely makes me angry at how bad it is.

346,alixj248,"Okay, Okay. Let me Try and Clear this Film's Name.",5,22 May 2015,"Right. First off, let me just say that Disney should never have considered this as a theatrical film under their banner. I'm still marveling at how The Hunchback of Notre Dame managed to get a Disney green-light. The truth is, the on stage 1980s musical which this movie is based on, is in fact meant to be dark and twisted. It's Grimm's fairy tales. In the original Cinderella, she didn't have a fairy godmother, she prayed at her mother's grave. The sisters DID cut their toes off to fit the slipper, and the birds DID peck out their eyes. Little Red Riding Hood as a whole is an allegory for staying away from strangers. In the story the wolf is supposed to be portrayed as a pedophile or a man of ill-intent. Therefore, Johnny Depp's portrayal was accurate-it's MEANT to make you feel uncomfortable. In the stage play, the wolf has a penis on his costume. Jack did kill the giant but it was to prevent it from slaying the other villagers. An act of Utilitarianism. The Baker's wife is NOT shown being ""banged against the tree by Cinderella's prince,"" as one reviewer here put it. There is kissing on the neck, however in the original her being ""banged"" against a tree is EXACTLY what happens. It's a a metaphor for adulterous behavior. In fact it's not even metaphorical, they straight up say it in the play. Act 1 of the play pulls out all these fairy tale characters bumping into each other and helping each other out, so each can get a happy ending. The Bakers get their child, The Witch gets her youth, Red gets all the bread she wants, Rapunzel sees the outside world, Cinderella gets married to the Prince and Jack and his mother become rich. Everyone gets what they want. Except they don't. In Act 2, everything goes to S**t. The bean that Cinders threw away grows into another stalk to which the wife of the giant climbs down swearing vengeance on Jack, the giant destroys everything, leaving Red homeless and killing her mother and Granny and leaving the whole kingdom in ruins. Not to mention Rapunzel's fear of the outside world grows stronger as everything is too new. In the play she is crushed to death by Giant but in the film she just says bye to her mother The Witch and rides away with her prince. This messes up The Witch's story arc in Act 2. Oh! And Jack's mother is also supposed to be clobbered to death by a guard. But in the movie the guard shoves her lightly and she hits her head on log-kind of lazy don't you think? It's such a dark film too, not just the subject matter but the lighting, so you sometimes have to strain to see what's really going on. However the redeeming features are the actors as they all bring something to their characters and the singing. My God! Meryl Streep is phenomenal in this! As is James Corden, Emily Blunt, as well as young Lila and Jamie who both did a terrific job. But as far as adaptations go, I admire them for trying to pull it off but it just DOES NOT work as a Disney family film. Into the Woods should have been rated PG-13 or an R. It has symbolic meanings and scenes of Child Abuse, Rape, Pedophilia, Adultery, Murder, Treason, Death as well as the world's most bittersweet ending. I'll admit I hated this film at first- but on a second viewing, it's really good! Not great, but the songs and acting are fantastic. It doesn't deserve too much crap, however it doesn't deserve a Disney logo underneath. Tim Burton or maybe even Steven Spielberg could have been able to pull this off, but as for a Disney film, I don't think it works. Just say the title, ""Into the Woods,"" it instantly fills you with fear and dread and this unsafe feeling. It's worth a watch once or twice maybe and the actors need awards for their efforts but it shouldn't have been advertised as a family flick.",Into the Woods
347,xfactor-78139,too much freaking singing!,1,5 April 2015,"I absolutely despised this movie. first of all, every other sentence was some form of song. I enjoy musicals as much as the next person, but who can tolerate that much verse? second of all, the plot was too confusing. Who's plot was the main plot? who is the main character? why is there so much singing? First it jumps to jack and the beanstalk, then Cinderella, then to some random baker's family, then to little red riding hood, who I assumed was who this movie was about, as the title song is her song (I know because I had to sing that song as a group for theater class). third of all, near the end things just get weird. an unnamed prince who married Cinderella has, shall we say, an ""interesting"" encounter with the Baker's wife. that was where I left the room, but the rest of the people who were watching it say that everyone important died.In conclusion, don't do drugs, stay in school, and don't watch this movie! it is to preserve your sanity.",Into the Woods
348,LedyMissy,Musical in Its Own Style,6,25 November 2015,"***This Review May Contain Spoilers***Looking at the trailers, I already predicted how the story will end. I was right about that, so I was preparing myself to be disappointed. This is one of those boring movies about fantasy and magic.But hey, was I wrong.Story-wise, even though I love how dynamic the story has progressed, they still jumped from one scene to another scene (heartbreakingly) with a rush.I lamented the sound effects where the witch just came from nowhere attempting to be frightening, they shouldn't make it so sudden. They failed at making her looked frightening. Instead, she was just annoying, almost boring. It's too shocking and not funny nor engaging. That was such a bad move. I almost cried.Character-wise, I was genuinely amused by the portrayal of some characters. I love Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) in this movie.Anyone who loves musical will find that this movie has lots of catchy songs. There's a lot of my favourites, including ""On the Steps of The Palace"", ""Giant in the Sky"", and ultimately, the most iconic song of this movie, is ""Agony"" sung by Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen a.k.a. The Princes.I think ""Into the Woods"" is a grim comedic movie. A musical in its own style. With an extraordinary moral lesson. If only you could bear to watch it until the very last end.(I hate that Rapunzel's story become pointless, I prefer to see her to have her own twisted sad tale, too. That would make the whole movie ""meat"". I basically believe that was the reason of why this movie has become overlooked by most. They're inconsistent in the moral story-line. I would gladly give this movie a ten out of ten if only they gave Rapunzel her own twisted sad tale, too.)Wicked, cunning, original. Heartwarming. I cried and I laughed along with this movie.

Other reviewers are correct, in that it isn't a movie for young children, and yes, it is a musical (duh). We thought all of the actors were great, with good singing voices, with the exception of Johnny Depp, who portrayed his part in a very creepy way. Meryl Streep is her usual fantastic self, and has a great voice. The costumes and sets were superb, and the storyline is very clever, as it weaves so many fairy tales together into the plot.We are surprised at all the one-star bad reviews.

352,ruthfromoz,Not as bad as I expected,6,7 April 2016,"As a long time fan of the stage show I was very cautious about watching the movie version. In fact, to a degree, I was pleasantly surprised. Compared with the movie versions of Les Miserables, Phantom and other stage musicals, it wasn't all that bad.An understandable disappointment was the omission of the narrator (and all the fun associated with this)- but the virtual non appearance of the Baker's father must have been very confusing for anyone not familiar with the show.Casting, with the exception of Anna Kendrick was good. Miss Kendrick is not a bad actress, but she is an awful singer, whereas the lovely Emily Blunt as the Baker's wife was a delight, both to the eyes and the ears. The inclusion of Johnny Depp, dressed in a very unwolflike outfit was fortunately short and his delivery focused more on the salacious side of the character and missed entirely the humour of the original. The Wolf has always been a rather contentious character, made more obvious by the fact that Red Riding Hood was played by a young person, whereas, in the stage versions I've seen an adult was cast in the role. Daniel Huttlestone was great as Jack - he sings and performs to perfection - the rest of the cast were adequate into which category surprisingly James Corden unfortunately falls.Meryl Streep (an actress I usually do not like) was excellent - maybe not as amusing and camp as Bernadette Peter's witch was - but she looked and sounded really good and was (to me) one of the surprises of the movie.Why I rated it overall fairly low is due to the fact that although the film adheres to most of the original, it somehow missed out on the humour in the stage show. Essentially a dark story, the original was lifted by the frequent laughs. Most of the lines that brought these laughs were either missing, or poorly delivered.And why was it overall so dark? Here I refer to the lack of colour in the scenery and clothing...dark story yes,but it has an uplifting message, so why not a bit of brightness here and there. It would have added dramatically to the overall effect.",Into the Woods

I watched the film with my four children aged 8,10,12 and 14 and without exception they all shared the pain. The story had potential and there was a reasonable job of knitting together several fairy-tales into a single narrative.

The whole concept is done nicely but there was some stuff that didn't fit like Disney's attempt at sexual innuendo and Rapunzel singing talents. The Prince duet/bromance actually gave the audience a second wind because some were falling asleep midway which was funny in itself. The songs are catchy and memorable so I can imagine kids eating this up and there's enough content for adults to enjoy but I don't find this being a Disney classic. I have no clue about some of the cast members, they're decent. Special effects are mediocre since the attention is on music and costumes.

No. Not for little children,8,10 January 2015,"It would seem to be from a HUGE number of reviews on this board that people have no idea that this film is an adaptation of the award winning stage musical by Sondheim.ALL the songs and the plot are as they are on the stage with some cuts to bring the running time down and to make it work on the big screen.So before you dismiss it OR watch it then you should be aware that this is NOT a fairy story for kids. It's dark and brooding in places and also has some adult themes (including infidelity).The basic plot in the first Act is that all the characters go into the woods to fulfil their wishes, which is what eventually happens. However in Act II the story explores the CONSEQUENCES of getting what you wish for.In the play, by the end of the show, nearly half the characters are killed off, including some of the princesses.Without putting spoilers in, I would say that if you are unfamiliar with the stage show and are considering taking your children to see this film, take a good read of the plot synopsis on Wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_WoodsIt's shame that so many people are giving this film a 1-star because it shocked them and upset the kids.

364,jpx400,"Good songs, strong cast, crappy adaptation",6,26 September 2015,"Just so it's said: I had no idea that Into The Woods was a stage musical before I watched the film and I still haven't seen the stage version. It still became pretty obvious that it was an adaptation less than half an hour in.Int The Woods is a a hodgepodge of classic fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk and Rapunzel, all united into one single, oddly written story. It begins when a witch, played by Meryl Streep, comes to a baker and his wife and tells them that she once cast a curse on his family to keep him from having any children and that it can be reversed by combining a collection of items within a few days. As the baker and his wife gather the items, their paths intersect with the other fairytale characters.As a film, Into The Woods is probably one of the most awkward stage-to-screen adaptations I've ever seen - and that is obvious even if you haven't seen the stage show. Most of the dialogue is filmed in very wide and sometimes distant shots, just like they were shot on an actual stage. The fact hat the film chooses not to show a lot of events that could NOT have been done on Broadway, but COULD have been done on film feels like a missed opportunity. And while Johnny Depp, playing the Big Bad Wolf, looks more like a character from Cats, an actor of his skill deserved a bigger role than this. But the biggest flaw in the screenplay is the narrative itself. The second half feels more like the start of a whole new story than a continuation of the first half. Some major plot points (can't say which without spoiling) are simply glossed over while more minor events are highlighted.That being said, the film has some strengths. The pacing has an intensity many writers can only dream about creating. The Cinderella portion of the story, starring Anna Kendrick, is a more interesting take on Cinderella than the last actual Cinderella movie. And while the cast is full of talented actors and singers alike, Meryl Streep stands out in pretty much every scene she's in.In conclusion, Into The Woods offers a lot of great songs performed by a well-chosen ensemble. It's worth watching for that and for the good acting performances. And as long as you can sit back and enjoy that without trying too hard to apply logic to the story, it's enjoyable enough.",Into the Woods

368,jtdb,"If you're expecting a ""happy Disney musical"" this is not for you",9,11 May 2017,"It is genuinely amazing how many people out there don't read anymore, as based on the huge number of negative reviews, many users 1) didn't know it was a musical; 2) didn't know it was on Broadway 30 years ago (and numerous times since); 3) got their knickers in a twist over the more ""adult"" material (faithful to the play and often right out of Grimm) and the more somber tone in Act II, and 4) hate the score. Going down the list: Yes, ""Into the Woods"" is a musical, but it was written by Stephen Sondheim (""Sweeney Todd"" ""Company"" ""Follies""), not Alan Mencken and co. It's supposed to be challenging music with lyrics that ask tough, hard questions about life, happiness, ambiguity, and ""happily ever after."" If you want simpler versions of these stories with more ""hummable"" songs, rent the other Disney versions. And yes, as it goes along, ""Into the Woods"" basically deconstructs fairy tale conventions by asking real-world queries: why is there suffering? Why does a ""good person"" die, but a ""bad"" person gets away with their behavior? Can you love someone and still be tempted by others? Etc. As far as the other more ""adult"" material: any Children's Lit course worth its salt references Bruno Bettelheim and his seminal work ""The Uses of Enchantment""--the interplay between Red and the Wolf is apiece with that. (And really, squawking about the ""violence"" in the Cinderella story? Again, go to the source material.) As a lover of the show, I could carp about a couple things (losing the princes' reprise of ""Agony""), but this is about as faithful and honorable an adaptation as one could ask of such a challenging, thorny show.

Family, No No. What was that? I guess it was a too-long-cut movie version of Once-Upon-a- Time TV series WANNABE. Don't go. Don't waste your time and money. Into the wooooood la la la la...

371,LogLady25,Horrible doesn't cover it.,1,4 January 2015,"Even Meryl Streep couldn't save this movie. Johnny Depp was in about two minutes of it before they killed him off. The whole plot was lost and went nowhere. The prince was looking for Cinderella for most of the movie and then decides he doesn't want Cinderella after all. The songs were bad. They tried to make every line rhyme and they all seemed forced. It was apparently supposed to be funny and it wasn't. I was laughing, but not because it was funny. I wanted to leave 20 minutes into the movie. I would pay another $25 dollars to let me un-see this. I don't know why this is nominated for anything. Sad that Meryl and Johnny were in it. They could have used Johnny much more than they did. I wanted the giant to come and squash me. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The only thing fun about this was all of the sarcastic comments that I got to make and thinking about all of the awful things that I would still pick over watching this movie.",Into the Woods
372,potablepictureshow,"Songs about wishes, don't need to wish for more songs",7,2 January 2015,"I approached ""Into the Woods"" with mild apprehension. As a heterosexual male I love musicals, but have often felt burned by the screen adaptations. The flatness of a non-live performance really takes the magic and encompassing feeling I get from seeing a show in person. One thing going for me is that I was not too familiar with the play, so no real first person expectations were set, although I had heard that the Disney movie failed to deliver on many of the themes and content of the stage version. It was only after having seen the movie that I put myself through a crash course of the Sondheim play via YouTube clips and online reviews.This review won't strive to reconcile the differences found between the stage and the screen version, but mainly to focus on the film only. In a nutshell the catalyst of the story is as follows: a baker and his wife are tasked by a witch to collect four items (Cinderella's shoe, Red's riding hood, Rapunzel's hair, and Jack's cow) in order to lift a curse that keeps the couple from having a baby. There are some good performances, topped by Meryl Streep's witch, some interesting and slightly surprising performances as I wasn't sure what I was going to get out of Chris Pine, and some performances that were over-hyped and under satisfying in the guise of Johnny Depp. Although Disney did lighten up and rewrite some elements, there was still plenty of dark elements- stepsisters mutilating their feet so that the fabled slipper would fit, Prince Charming successfully seducing the Baker's wife (although he only kissed her and didn't outright hump her as in the play), and there was also death relatively devoid of romanticism.The film made the protagonist narrator (the baker) and the male roles as a whole difficult to identify or sympathize with. The baker was a near incompetent without a generous heart and only slight parental instincts. Jack was an idiot boy. The Wolf was a voracious pedophile. Prince Charming was a dim light bulb and adulterer. Even the prince's steward and the Baker's father got into the act as an arrogant (accidental) murderer and a family deserter respectively. The female roles on the other hand were either that of nurturing mother or of a smothering, destructive nature, or sometimes as in the case of the witch, a Shiva-esque combination of creator and destroyer.Just as the film seems to be wrapping up, we have another 30 minutes or so of a third act that feels like an hour and a half. Maybe I just had reached full song saturation by that point.In my opinion it was fortunate to have seen the movie first in much the same way as having read the book after is less disappointing than the other way around. It was harder to feel let down, frustrated or dissatisfied. The film had well thought out, engaging musical numbers. It did seem to fail on following through entirely on its ""be careful what you wish for bit"" but was more successful on its ""you are nice not good"" theme. The overall theme of child-parent relationships and parental failings (regardless of intention) was well covered across various characters.If you like musicals, then give this a shot, especially if you are not very familiar with the play. If you like twists on fairy tales, give this a try. If you are not game for either one of those, then not sure what else this movie has to offer.Blarv Score: 7 out of 10.",Into the Woods

The cast is horrible (with notable exception of Emily Blunt, by far the best in this movie). The musical themes are unappealing, boring and repetitive. Besides, will Disney never grow out the fairy tales? It's kinda repetitive. I really hate to say this, specially about these stories about fantasy that I love so much, but come on... merge them all in one crappy musical? And don't give that nonsense about being original: the gritty side about these fairy tales has been explored time and time again.Don't touch it. Stay away from it.

I myself have mixed emotions because every positive attribute has a negative along side it. With brilliant casting choices like Meryl Streep alongside the less brilliant James Corden this was guaranteed to have mixed responses. I think the music was as amazing as on stage and the set designs and outfits were spectacular, but the plot was a bit in your face about the shared tale among the characters. The plot itself was rather enthralling and I loved the faux happy ending element.

The songs throughout don't get any better either. Not sure if the soundtrack was a big seller usually a good indication of a good movie musical. Story line is a big jumble and perhaps tries to be a bit clever. This films lacks humor and should have had some comic relief. At least films like Shrek have some nice songs and it's extremely funny. Anna Kendrick is a poor choice as Cinderella had much more fun with Drew Barrymore in Ever After years ago. I'm thankful Meryl Streep didn't win an Oscar. Kids won't be running back for this again and again. It's really the God awful songs that ruin everything.

Surely the special effects were lacking, but the story also diverged somewhat from the play. And the play special effects are not good for a movie. If you must see, then wait for the video. On TV, where it will be free. The message was bad, particularly Jack and the Beanstalk, but it did make fun of Prince Charming, and fairytale princes in general.

Better to just machete the final part of the film and jump to the credits.Mind you, I get that this is consistent with the source material, but the tone of the first part is just the wrong set-up for the dark second part.

The only reason I didn't step out was for the funny scenes between the princes. It is not even a movie for all public.

383,docweaselband,Stereotypical Sondheim,3,4 August 2021,"Sondheim is a contrarian known for twisting genres and going against the grain and he did so in his Broadway version, which is subversive and slightly perverse. This is the cleaned up, disneyfied version. Even though some cast members, like Depp, seem shoe-horned in (someone more sinister like the late Alan Rickman would have been better and set a tone) I only had problems with 2: first and foremost I DETEST stage-managed precocious kid belters of the type who usually play Annie and Lilla Crawford is no exception. She grates. Her entire ""schooled at the Broadway singing style since she was 2 years old"" with its nasal overtones really gets on the nerves. Condon should have left her in the wolf's gullet. Speaking of Condon, for a seemingly pleasant, bland guy, he also grates. They needed stronger actors for some of these roles to give them weight. Streep is past being a 'great actress'- in her last 10 films she's played a caricature of herself and her over-the-top hamming it up here when sinister and evil would serve better again ruins the tone. Finally, princesses and female leads should be beautiful. The princes are prettier than Kendricks and whoever Repunzel is. Keira Knightley (or thinking of Pride/Bride and Prejudice, Aishwarya Rai) and Natalie Portman or Holiday Granger types are called for here. Joanna Riding as Cinderella's mother is prettier than any of the lead actresses. I was also glad to see Tracey Ullman (who inadvertently gave the world the Simpsons) is still alive and working, accidently caught her vid for ""They Don't Know"" recently and remembered how witty ahd funny she used to be. In short, except for Condon I enjoyed the male actors (even the kid, who doesn't seem too stage-mothered, unlike RRH) and either hated (Crawford) or disliked (Streep,I would have liked to have seen Cher, who did a table reading for a proposed version on the '90s take a shot at it) most of the females and thought them miscast. Emily Blunt is her usual serviceable self and loved seeing Joanna Riding working. The songs are merely THERE, they don't have any lasting effect and I can't remember the melody to a single one but you can't do a farce like this unless it's a musical so it is what it is, but the musical interludes are forgettable and unnecessary. Sondheim used to write songs that scanned beautifully and had flowing melodies, these are herky-jerky and remind me of songs where the composer writes the words first in nearly free-verse and then grafts on un-melodic, rambling, bombastic, scattered accompaniment. The song between Blunt and Condon in the woods is a perfect example. No 2 phrases of the song seem to fit together. It's 20 parts of 20 songs stitched together with no natural flow. To refresh my palate I had to watch West Side Story where Sondheim was a brilliant lyricist and a vastly superior and original composer wrote iconic melodies that have been covered hundreds of times by popular singers. Can you imagine anyone covering ANY of these stinkers? The ballad Streep croaks out is an attempt at a standard but it's weak and repetitive and ful of vocal gymnastics but lacks the spark of A L Weber's set pieces or even Sondheims other ballads. It meanders all over the place, like all the music in this piece. What's missing the most is the menace and violence and evil of the play. Repunzel should have died.",Into the Woods

The cast was absolutely brilliant so I had no doubt that this will be a movie to watch multiple times. Oh man, was I wrong.. I usually love movie musicals because the story is much more powerful with the singing and the emotions are overwhelming, so I thought this would be the same. Well, it wasn't. The acting was perfect, the effects were awesome, the costumes were brilliant. What could be so bad you ask?The story. The story is completely, and I mean completely, ridiculous. I am still amazed at how they managed to mess it up this much. Throughout the movie I was laughing like a lunatic, because it was completely stupid. I thought that maybe in the end the movie will turn out to be brilliant, so I watched and watched, waiting for some twist that will improve the movie. And when I thought that the movie is finally going to end, whoops, there comes a giant, and the story continues even more horrible than before. Yes, that was possible and I didn't even believe in that. It ended absurdly and left many loose ends. I usually love long movies, but the 2 hours I was in the cinema watching this movie, felt like an eternity.

The casting was great, I didn't disagree with any of their choices. I was slightly skeptical of Chris Pine beforehand--I love the man, but I was afraid they put him in just because he's a popular hot-guy actor right now. But once I truly remembered the character he portrays, I realized that it was a perfect choice. No acting issues, even the kids acted wonderfully. And I was very grateful that this didn't get modernized with a bunch of ""inside jokes"" or modern pop culture references like some things can.The singing was nearly perfect, in my opinion. There were a few weird parts, but I believe it was mostly from the children, so that's excusable. I already adored Sondheim's music, so I fully expected to love the songs. They kept all the songs I knew, and I don't know if anything was added or a song I didn't remember was taken out. Basically, all the ""big"" ones are there as far as I know.I walked out already waiting to see it again.

If you can't understand a Disney musical, then what are you doing in the cinema? If you found this boring then you don't deserve to watch movies at all. What a BRILLIANT introduction to the whole story and what a WONDERFUL ending!! I enjoyed every song throughout the act and every word had a meaning and a strong message behind. I don't usually write reviews but all the reviews and people pretending to know a good musical is just angered me so much!Conclusion is - If you want to go and watch a nice, relaxing, funny and very well made musical by Disney - please go and enjoy!

As a fairy tail lover I love how they merged a few fairy tales together but when the Baker's task was done everything started to go downhill and it became really, really strange. I wouldn't even call it a family movie because it's way too extreme in my opinion. I don't know what I should call it - a fantasy? a horror film? or just a bad one... There are too, and so many random deaths. Jack's mother, Baker's wife, THE WITCH... and other character were not seem to care at all. What happened between the prince and the baker's wife by the way? very random, again. The ending was one of the strangest endings I've ever seen. Everything had a little to no detail on it - Why and how did the witch died? She needed her beans to remain young but when she got them back she didn't turn young again, how does it make sense? The girl who played Red Hood was so annoying, when everyone else were starting to die I wished she would get smashed by the giant or fall off a cliff as well.

Then I found out it was delivering exactly what I could expect from it, and well done also. Who can ask for anything more these days? I see all the really bad ratings were expecting something different. Either is too Sondheim for them, or too Disney. Well, it is a Sondheim musical adapted for Disney. They didn't hide any of that, did they? it's a compromised job,short of in between of nowhere, but that's what they sold. I mean, you know what McDonald's is, if you want a great prime rib meat you wouldn't go there, and if you despise meat you wouldn't either. But if you know what you are looking for and it's what they sell, it's perfectly all right to go.I knew it couldn't be really true to Sondheim, because Disney wouldn't have produced it, and probably not any big budget studio. So I expected a lot of losses. I would have paid for a truer version, but millions wouldn't. So it couldn't be made in this world.I knew it wasn't a family movie, because why bother adapting this play into a family movie? it would be like trying to adapt the novel 1984 into a family movie.So it could only be what it is. And being that, I think it's a bold effort and a passionate work from the director and the actors, I hope they were prepared for the insulting reviews and the disappointment of the public, because I think they don't deserve it, but they would know it could happen. I feel grateful that they did this movie, It left me wanting to watch the play which I think it's a great thing, doing some homage to an original work and carrying people to the original. The first act is really enjoyable, I was thrilled to see it was done with flawless performances and real emotions. It is true that the second act loses interest. But even so, they made a great job considering they had to cut most of the play's strongest ""punches"". For me, the music was perfectly performed and produced, it really gave me the multiple emotions that a Sondheim musical delivers. It is also true that since I was expecting the worst movie ever, it easily surpassed my expectations. Some great movies you love them without knowing anything in advance, this isn't one of those movies.Please, keep doing these movies, keep taking risks and bring us works that many of us won't understand. There are already too many works that won't make anyone uncomfortable. And if you know a couple of Sondheim pays, and you enjoy them, but you understand the compromises cinema has to make to please producers (and sell). Watch this, it's worth it.

I think many watched it thinking it would be a happily ever after story but it's not and that's the point. I first heard about/watched the play version in a college drama class. The characters start out struggling but still idealistic. They believe they can achieve their wishes and set out to do that. Then, after they've each gotten what they thought they wanted they realized they didn't want it or in some cases they didn't want it yet. And while they're struggling to come to grips with the idea that maybe they didn't want their wishes granted after all, the giant attacks and knocks them for a loop. Characters die, marriages fail and they see that maybe happily ever after isn't an idealistic fairy tale dream but instead it's the reality of their acceptance of and for themselves as they are.

I loved the first half of the film but the second half I just wanted the movie to be over(and not in a good way). I personally think the film should have ended when James Gordon was saying happily ever after. If you haven't seen the film right before James could finish his sentence a giant attacks. Everything after this point in the movie was boring. Except for the song where the characters where they are trying to figure out who's fault it was for the giant attacking. I was really confused when James Gordon started to tell his baby about what happened over those few days. I think everyone did an amazing job with their roles except the person who played Repunzel. I think they could have had Kira Knightly play her. This is all just my opinion if you loved the movie that is great if you didn't that is great as well. I am not saying you shouldn't watch the movie but in my opinion just stop when James Gordon starts to say happily ever after. You can Google the song where the characters are blaming everything on each other on YouTube if you want. Again this is all my opinion I am fine if yours is different.,Into the Woods

There's simply too much going on, not enough character development and too many subplots that don't go anywhere and make the film innecesarily long. Lots of songs, which are fine, but not memorable, no wonder any of the songs is remembered 6 years after this movie was released.The photography and costumes are also very nice with beautiful landscapes and well done costumes, but does it really matter if the movie it's not worth watching?

I loved the original and I wanted to love this. And love it I did! It was true to the musical. So much of the dialog and songs were verbatim from the play. The movie seemed to flesh out the scenes perfectly and give them more emotional oomph. I'll probably be going to see it again and definitely look forward to adding it to my Blu-Ray collection.

The first half - about a mission to fulfill the wishes of a witch- is loyal to the fairy tales narrative. But the second half of the movie bares almost no relation to the first half (other than having the same characters), the music feels terribly repetitive by then, and the movie is almost blue all the time, lacking the typical colorful aspect of musicals (even a musical as dark as ""Sweeney Todd"" keeps bright colors) and, worst of all, the plot is uninteresting and the characters actions are unbelievable (giving no details to avoid spoilers).

It works remarkably well. Don't think they dropped any songs and all my favourite lines were there.

400,catherinetaormina,Great visuals,6,26 December 2014,"I don't like Sondheim, never have ever since I was a kid...why? because there is nothing melodic about his music...can you sing to it? is anything catchy - I do still find myself screeching from time to time ""into the woods to grandmother's house"" after I saw the play when I was in my teens. I also remember thinking the play was over after act 1 and making my way out of the theater not understanding why audience members were dilly dallying in their seats. Then an announcement was made to please return to your seats for Act 2. I found this same spot in the movie: when all things are resolved halfway through. OK, all children (and adults) want to see the top of the beanstalk, you will not get this in this movie. Why? I ask, when all technology now in cinema can make this possible. And what's with cutting off the giant wife's face for almost her total screen time? The cast is good...I liked little Jack the best. Anna Kendrick is just the same now too me...after 50/50, Up In The Air I don't think she has done a different character - though she can sing, like Little Red whose voice is more pleasing to the eye. I think Meryl Streep became Johnny Depp, and he is hardly in the movie - another guy who plays Ed Wood in most of his movies - but it only really worked in Ed Wood. Christine Baranski, always great, step sisters fun too. Rapunzel lady too modern looking...whatever that means. Best word in movie: ""breasts"". I think it could be up for Best Picture for cinematography as I was impressed by all things visual.",Into the Woods
401,t-mclean1,Really really bad,1,31 January 2015,"I won't go into any great depth, so, other than a few general complaints, the ins and outs of the story line will remain completely out of this review. The songs are awful, none of them are memorable. Instead of catchy choruses they have horrible, repetitive melodies (which aren't even pleasing to the ear). The acting never really gets off the ground, mainly due to almost the entire script being songs... I know it's a musical but so is Beauty and the Beast and that manages to use songs in a much better way than Into the Woods.I really tried to think of a redeeming quality, honestly I did, but I just can't. It really is a surprise that so many known actors agreed to be in this, the fees must have been enormous to convince them.

402,mtl429,Walked out!!,1,31 December 2014,"OK...so first of all I ""did"" know this was a musical, and ""do"" like musicals. I don't always go out of my way to watch them, but this one looked fun for the family and I to watch. Waste of my money, waste of my time, waste of acting talent, etc etc etc. The music was weird and didn't make any sense. Basically rhymes for the sake of making a rhyme. Johnny Depp seemed like he was trying to seduce Little Red Riding Hood by getting awkwardly close to her, the strange lyrics, and weird dancing. Plus the odd re-telling of how the girl got out of his stomach when the baker cut her open made it seem like they were on drugs when they wrote that scene. The only scene that was slightly enjoyable was the Agony song, mainly because it was hilarious whether it was meant to be or not. When the supposed ending came where everyone seemed pretty satisfied and then everything went down hill, my wife and I looked at each other with a ""are you kidding me?"" face. Things just got weirder and weirder, and once the prince started making out with the bakers wife we pretty much threw in the towel on the movie as a whole. My 7 year old daughter even recognized how odd things were getting and told her Mom how weird this movie was. We just left with the disgusted feeling that this movie actually exists in this world, and the fact that people rate a PG movie so high when it involves so many immoral things in one.

It has Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep, and a few other great people. It has a very talented, all start cast... We went and saw it yesterday... AND? It was HORRIBLE. I fell asleep eventually and just kept waiting for the worst musical i've ever seen to end... it wasn't even a musical! They weren't even singing! They were talk singing.. It was just BAD. Very very poorly written movie. I honestly feel bad for the cast because they are all so talented but the storyline was horrible. The little boy was a very good singer (he actually sang in a couple short parts)..Johnny Depp's role? Very small and if you watch it, i'm positive his character is a pedophile... The way he follows red riding hood around. He's talking about her succulent flesh and how she doesn't even have any lumps.. (what lumps is he referring to?? Just me?).. He goes on to pull his coat open like someone who's going to flash someone and it turns out he has a coat full of candy he's trying to lure her with.. (Not something a pedo would do at all...).. I'm not making fun of Johnny Depp at all but you just have to watch it, i'm convinced whoever wrote this movie was a loon, a pedophile, and a downright pervert!

404,adelecdw,Judge it for yourself.,8,26 December 2014,Don't listen to these mindless reviewers. This was my first Musical movie. At first it was weird seeing characters sing instead of speak but it slowly grew on me. Listen to the lyrics of the songs carefully. And honestly I loved it. Going in I thought it would be just another kids movie with slightly dark undertones like Maleficent. But 20 minutes into the movie I realized that this is more mature than anything Disney has produced. Don't expect mindless fairy tale action. Look for instances that mirror the real life. Its a very touching story. Though it has its flaws it was produced really well. The ending was pretty dark but satisfying. I feel sad for anyone who doesn't understand the movie. Just shows how dumb and mindless people can be.,Into the Woods
405,teerabhat9,Like preaching adolescents with children's book that aim to entertain adults.,6,18 January 2015,"The most imperative question for every filmmaker is quite simple. Who is my intended audience? This is not solely because of monetary reasons. Of course, profit is important for any business, but even art for art's sake needs to attract certain audience. Into The Wood utterly fails in this aspect. The morality of the wood seems to be appropriate for adolescents, however, the storytelling is too obvious for anyone older than 10 years old. The violence and certain themes make me think of a film for mature audience though. To clarify, it's perfectly legitimate to make a film that can attract the whole family and Disney tends to be quite good at that. Nonetheless, this is not a film for the whole family. It has bits and pieces for this and that audience, but the film as a whole is nothing more than a mess.Last but not least, I believe that a good musical should consist of songs that are meaningful out of context but are even more meaningful within context. I'm afraid that no one will sing Into the Wood's songs in the same way people sing 'Music of the Night,' 'I dreamed a dream,' 'Defying gravity,' or 'Impossible Dream' soon.On the plus side, the techniques are alright. Meryl Streep is incredible. If you're her fan, I see no reason not to go see this film...",Into the Woods

407,pattypattydang,"Good, BUT...not for kids...NOTHING like the trailers...think stage presentation",6,2 May 2015,"I'm leaving my original review below to illustrate how a mind set, at least for me, can sway an opinion. I hated this movie the first time I started to watch it. I viewed it with my daughter and we had both been looking forward to this film from watching the trailers. It was so unlike the trailers that we just turned it off. I was angry and disappointed that my daughter had been disappointed. I hoped to save others from wasting their time as we had so I wrote a very negative review. Even though I didn't like the film the first time around, the cast and production was so top notch that I decided to give the movie another shot, but this time with no expectations induced by trailers...just watch and absorb. Woah...a completely different experience! I still can't say that this was a brilliant film, but I am changing my one star to a six or maybe even a seven star rating.It's a good, well done musical. If looked at as a movie rendition of a stage production, it comes across wonderfully. Yes, I know that that is exactly what it is, but the trailers DO NOT portray it that way and there in lies the big disconnect. I think most people that rate this so low were sucked in by the trailers and a Disney stereotype...or assume it is a movie for kids.Watch this movie with no preconceived ideas other than maybe pretending that you are in the audience of a stage production. The music that was horrid is suddenly interesting and well executed and it's complexities are easier to appreciate. The acting is wonderful for the stage but too over the top and somewhat stilted for normal Hollywood/Disney...so again, view it as a stage presentation. The story set-up is a bit tedious and the real meat of the play doesn't come across until about an hour into the movie, so relax and give it a chance to build up. It is well worth watching, but it is not really for children and the gist of the play has little to do with fairy tales. The plot is still a bit disjointed and borders on being ragged but the seemingly disconnectedness of the set-up mostly gels towards the end. It is has a satisfying conclusion. After my second viewing, I can recommend watching this film.My previous take on this film:""The first 26 minutes were awful...just garbage""The first 26 minutes were more than enough to tell me it wasn't going to get much better. I turned it off. I don't think I have ever just turned off a movie before. ...I even like bad B movies, but this was close to criminal with it's waste of budget and talent.I find it hard to believe that this dismal film is rated 6.1 on IMDb. In the first ten pages of reviews (all I went through), I could find only two positive reviews; the first reviewer found the film tepid; the second reviewer loved the film. Who are all the lovers of this film in the sea of one star ratings?With such a budget and such talented actors how could such a piece of garbage result...it's an absolute mystery. This is, at best, fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3K.Give me half the budget and I will make a better movie...guaranteed.",Into the Woods

Good choices considering how difficult it is to bring something from the stage to the screen. Notice that everything flows - there is no break between the spoken dialog and the songs.The acting? Jeez. Meryl Steep. When is she not terrific? Really. Here she gives a nuanced witch that would have been a cardboard caricature in the hands of a hack like Jennifer Lawrence. I wouldn't have changed anyone in the cast - even though the timbre of Little Red Riding Hood's voice was like nails on a blackboard (but at least she was on pitch).A 1 star movie?

It looked cool, we knew it was a musical and an adaptation of Grimms Fairy Tales. Instead we were treated to a really bad story line, bad singing and over acting (yes Meryl Streep, You!). It was so bad we left the theatre and I demanded and received a refund. Unless you're a snooty art critic, movie critic or a die hard Manhattan Broadway regular, do not go to see this garbage. This is coming from normal people who thoroughly enjoy Disney films, the Grimm Brothers movie, Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, etc. I'm not a fan of musicals but I have an open mind and yes, I can take seeing something like ""Mama Mia"", or ""Hairspray"", but I've got to draw the line when they sing the entire script from beginning to end.

410,rickfoley247,It's a musical try casting actors who can carry a tune.,1,13 February 2019,First of let me say I enjoy musicals. I saw the orginal play both on Broadway and in London and enjoyed it very much both times. This movie is the adaptation of as Broadway musical so of course it's going to be a musical. I understand not everyone enjoys musicals so this movie is not going to be for everyone. However grading a musical down just because you do not enjoy musicals is simple not fair. What ruined the movie for me was most of the main cast could not carry a tune or sing better than an amateurish level. I have seen high school performances of this show with better singing voices. Even Meryl Streep who is a wonderful actor was a pale imitation of Pia Zadora orginal performance. Why cant Hollywood hire people who can actually sing for musica instead of the usual stunt casting. If the rest if cast is good a musical can get buy with one bong singer if there performance is good enough. The King and I and Camalot are two good examples of this. However in this horrible adaptation none of the cast had great singing voices. Why Streep would be involved with this production is mind boggling. If your a fan of the orginal musical or just a fan of good music stay far away from this.,Into the Woods

The little lack of entertainment is more than compensated by the up and downs and the many drifts of well known stories of some fairy tails. In other words I liked it very much!

And watch it till the end.There is no action, and the movie is not always entertaining, but this little movie/musical maybe can show you some more important things. Find your love, find your luck.

I do understand that most of the 'reviews' on IMDb are written by extraordinarily ignorant Americans with a mental age of about 12 and virtually no experience of films or the world going back more than two or three years but how completely incompetent are these people? (and isn't it interesting that they can neither spell nor apply the simplest rules of grammar in their writing?!?) Into the Woods is a brilliant musical by the most intelligent librettist of the C20th. The very idea of plaiting the stories of Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella and Rapunzel into a single scenario involving a small community is a stroke of genius. The music is entirely appropriate to the situations: you can't have a little girl skipping into the woods to grandmother's house to a Beethovenian symphony. The critics of Johnny Depp's portrayal of the wolf seem to have completely missed the fact that he is playing the wolf as a very creepy paedophile.

How wrong was I in every way. The movie is almost flawless; the performances, production design, costumes, hair & make up, singing. Streep's voice rivals all the stage greats and is standout. (Gotta be honest found her transformation a bit cheesy in a Death Comes Her way.)

415,LeighEllis,If you enjoy unpolished and unedited movies,3,17 January 2015,"What a disappointment! Even after reading so many negative reviews about Into the Woods, I let myself get talked into going anyway. My first clue that the low star reviews were accurate came when we walked into a nearly empty theater, even though the parking lots were jam packed with cars. Some of the performances were worth watching and the only thing that kept me from walking out on several occasions. Meryl Streep always strikes me as born to portray whatever character she is playing and the witch was no exception. It's like she was channeling theessence of what makes someone a witch. I jumped every time she made one of her powerful, explosive entrances, and her singing was superb. Butcasting her in this seemed like throwing a pearl to the swine. What a waste! Daniel Huttlestone as the engaging Jack was an unexpected highlight. I hope we see a lot more of him in the future. That boy can sing! Johnny Depp's portrayal of the wolf as a slimy character with admittedly ""carnal"" urges seemed to imply that pedophilia was the carnality of the day. The ""come here little girl"" song and the way he was touching her made we want to call family services. Although the movie tried to stay true to it's stage roots, the occasional special effects crept in which were far more enjoyable than the endless singing of less than mediocre songs. To be perfectly honest, I found the singing interminable and insufferable. The songs sounded like they were made up as the characters went along. Words cannot express how unenjoyable I found the lyrics and tunes. After almost 1 1/2 hours I thought the end was in sight but then the ""earthquake"" hit. After that, it seemed like the movie was starting over or decided to throw in a sequel. They should have made a graceful exit at that point and saved the rest for another time. I was more than ready to go home to bed because the never ending songs were putting me to sleep. In the end I cannot recommend anyone spending their hard earned money on this movie. I might recommend the movie as a rental though, so the songs can be forwarded through, but that would eliminate the movie's only saving graces which can best be experienced to their fullest at a theater. Someone needs to make an edited version of this movie that might actually be fun to watch.",Into the Woods

And as it progressed, I was happily taken along, for the most part. But then it happened...that seemingly prerequisite twist that all modern fairy tales demand. Not as revisionist as in Wicked, and Maleficent. So at least it wasn't that ""bad guy's really the good guy"" ploy this time. No, this time it was ""everyone's a schmuck!"" But what was the point? The witch was eaten by her garden? The prince ""kisses"" the baker's wife, and she dies? And what was with all the sub-text with the wolf and Red Riding Hood? I thought that was borderline, at least. I felt the last act was what should have been scrapped for something a little more...I don't know, redemptive? I had the feeling that everyone in the final scene was, at best, a refugee.

Second, I did not know this was a Broadway production made into a movie-musical. So I went in with high hopes. I wanted to walk out after 10 minutes. But I stayed. And fidgeted. And tried to find something good about this show. The whole time I kept thinking to myself, 'this would be better on Broadway.' The songs are not memorable. It isn't that they are bad songs. It's that the music doesn't fit the movie. You've got fairy tales with music more suitable to Les Miserable. Sure, there were some funny/poignant/memorable lines in the songs, but definitely not enough to make up for an otherwise unremarkable soundtrack. As for the acting, I though Streep was superb, as was her singing in some parts. I thought Depp's song while ogling Little Red Riding Hood was sick! I had a tough time watching that scene. It was like watching a pedophile stalk his prey. It made my stomach turn. Aside from that one song, Depp, as always, was terrific. Some of the characters did not mesh with what I was brought up on from Disney. The actresses playing Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood weren't what I would have envisioned for those characters.

Which they can do by gathering different ingredients from different characters. Of course nothing will go to plan and they'll need to work all together to stop the witch.The singing in this movie is what you'll expect it to be, as in any other musical.

This has always been my least favorite of the Sondheim musicals I am familiar with and he has always been my favorite Broadway composer. This film changed my opinion. I now rank Sondheim in the range of genius and this musical among my favorites. The film translated ""Into the Woods"" beautifully from stage to screen and even managed to make more sense on screen than on stage!!! Meryl Streep is so amazing, I lack adequate adverbs. Having recently lost my mother ""No One is Alone"" had me in tears. Chris Pine is hilarious and gorgeous as Prince Charming. Johnny Depp is a creepy, slimy Big Bad Wolf. Emily Blunt is beautiful and touching. I could go on and on, but I won't reveal anything to spoil the good times. Just be aware, this IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE!! It IS NOT A Disney FAIRYTALE!!

I am a fan of the Grimm Brothers' Fairy Tales, and they kept with the original story, it being darker. However, I didn't understand the purpose of the witch's character, and felt Meryl Streep could have picked a better project. All of the characters were flat and never truly developed. Also, why did Prince Charming still go and search for Cinderella knowing that the Baker's wife had the other slipper? Any person with a brain would have mistaken her for the mystery girl. Also why would a girl just hand over her cloak so willingly when her grandmother gave that to her? He saved her life, so what? You don't give a stranger your own personal treasure. Also she would no longer be Red Riding Hood, but Wolf Hoodie Girl from Hot Topic. This musical butchered each of the fairy tales, and didn't work as a whole unit. I'd rather watch Shrek which made each fairy tale character interesting. Even Hoodwinked is better than this movie. I cannot believe this movie won awards. Even magic beans cannot save this movie.

427,violon-fou,Disney redeems itself for once,10,4 January 2015,"When I took my seat last week at the local CineMegaTron5000, which played a series of previews for pure, regurgitated, 3d-animated garbage, I couldn't help but fear utter disappointment looming on the big screen. Instead, the seamless integration of Sondheim's fabulous music with beautiful camera work (the kind that doesn't switch angles every half-second!), an excellent cast, and tasteful special effects held me to my seat well into the closing credits.Although I noticed some significant changes to the plot compared to Broadway, the core emotional journey of the characters (and the audience) stayed true to the original. Where some details were lost, other creative possibilities opened up (the use of the Baker himself as narrator instead of his father, for instance).The negative reviews here focus on their writers' frustrations with the material substance of the film (difficult music, unchanging scenery, complex web of characters). How unfortunate that these reviewers left their Dr.-Dolittle-2 comfort zone to soil this film's reputation. Maybe they were offended that a Hollywood movie demanded more brain cells than they currently have available? That music, contrary to their deeply held beliefs, does not consist solely of four chords? Or maybe it was the outrageous thought that a story could revolve around characters discovering life's beauty and difficulties instead of explosions, murders, spies, and special effects?But at least these reviewers have no reason to be distraught. If biologically they can only tolerate the lowest common denominator, I can recommend more than a few vacuous, saccharine pieces of screen-cesspool with the artistic courage of a used baby diaper. I, meanwhile, would gladly cross a forest to see Into the Woods again.",Into the Woods
428,info-4733,Loved it,8,19 January 2015,"I am glad that I didn't head all the 1 star dire reviews of Into the Woods and went along and made up my own mind. And I thought it was great. Not perfect - as someone else points out the second half is rushed, losing a number of plot lines and sadly ""No More"". But overall it is an intelligent and beautiful looking movie version of Sondheim's stage work. In truth I enjoyed it better than the stage version (which I have seen twice, including the London production) and can only assume that many of the terrible reviews were from people who didn't realise that they were going to spend 2 hours with Sondheim, perhaps having been weaned on a diet of Hairspray and Jersey Boys and the like. Despite the absence of ""No More"", the score is still wonderful - how anyone can condemn a score that includes the likes of ""Children Will Listen"", ""Agony"", ""Into The Woods"", ""On The Steps of the Palace"", plus of course the ravishing ""No One Is Alone"", is beyond me. It is also beautifully sung - to my mind Meryl Streep sings the witch's songs far better than Bernadette Peters on the Broadway cast recording - and she is ably supported by the likes of Emily Blunt and Anna Kendricks. And that doesn't even take account of the joy of hearing Sondheim's glorious melodies performed by a huge symphonic orchestra. So if you are Sondheim fan don't be put off my all the negativity floating about. This is no ""Nine"" but a quality adaption of a stage work.",Into the Woods

431,kerrychesterpalmbeach,"Honestly, Sondheim better on stage",6,3 January 2015,"I love Stephen Sondheim. I'm a bit of a Stephen Sondheim loving geek. I was disappointed in the movie version of ""Into The Woods"" which, in my mind, diminishes one of Sondheim's most genius piece of writing. His lyrics, especially, are incomparably witty and yet poignant and truthful all at once. Problem with the film is that the visual becomes so distracting that you can't possibly concentrate on the music and lyrics. I think the cast was wonderful, especially Meryl Streep, but really, if you compare it to the staged version, all the characters and scenes are so much more delicious and fun on stage. I'm extremely thrilled that this musical is introduced to the world and that Sondheim's genius can go mainstream in such a big way. It's thrilling that the movie has done so well, but folks, if you can see a reputable staged company do ""Into The Woods"", you should see this on stage, as written, with no cuts. It's truly magical. I give the film version a 6 because it doesn't compare to the few staged versions I've seen.",Into the Woods
432,GrantWilli,Stunningly....awful,3,10 January 2015,"OK, OK, I didn't do my homework, I saw it was based on Grimm fairy tales which my teenage kids love and I enjoy. I didn't have high expectations but perhaps something with a darker twist, say Van Helsing for example (not great but passable) I paid my $45, got the popcorn, watched the opening titles and then they began to sing! Oh no, a musical, I'm not a fan of musicals in the first place although Rocky Horror and Grease have their place. I'm not familiar with the stage show of Into the Woods and neither am I ever likely to become. The singing of some of the characters (although true to note) was like chalk on a blackboard to me.Rapunzel disappears half way through with her prince. Cinderella's mother and sisters disappear in the forest with a warning from the witch but nothing occurs. There seems to be some parable in here about stoning old women to death being perhaps not a good thing (as the giants wife is a person too) but then they do it anyway with an us and them mentality. Not sure why Jacks mother had to die except to give the impression that the Baker and Cinderella may shack up at the end with all the orphans and the Bakers son. The Bakers wife dies after kissing the married Prince but he does not (is this a lesson in morality for children?). At least in the waterfall singing prince scene someone woke up to the ridiculousness of the situation and even they couldn't take themselves seriously. There was some semblance of Grimm provided by Johnny Depp who plays a suitably pedophile like wolf but I suspect he was happy his exit was very quick. Streep was good no doubt but how hard is it to play a villain anyway. There is something inherently simple about playing the bad guy and I think there was an opportunity to flesh out more complexity than just a bad witch. Her love for Rapunzel for example. I really don't know why Jacks cow was resurrected and not the Bakers wife?Really my votes are for costumes and sets as well as some clever lyrics that I did pick up on throughout the show.2 hours lost, one of my daughters was mildly amused by it and the other hated it more than I. We did laugh a lot on the way home about how bad it was.",Into the Woods
433,muellercraft,Put down the popcorn and back away slowly,1,20 January 2015,"This film is a standard by which to judge all other bad films. For me personally from now on when I see a bad movie I will have to qualify it with ""yes, it was a terrible offense against taste and good judgment, but at least it wasn't as bad as 'Into the Woods.'"" My internal crapometer red-lined about thirty seconds into this movie. The first song was so bad that I winced and closed my eyes. But the joke was on me, because that first song runs at least four hundred years. I couldn't keep my eyes closed that long, but I wish I had.I am a fan of good Broadway musicals. Note my usage of the word 'good.' 'Good' would include things like 'Guys and Dolls', 'Music Man', 'Oklahoma' 'Phantom of the Opera' and the like. There are plenty of bad Broadway musicals, too. I have never seen 'Into the Woods' on stage; maybe it is better there. I doubt it, though, because the first presenting problem with 'Into the Woods' is the fact that the songs are terrible. Not just the first song -- no, that would be forgivable. EVERY SINGLE SONG in the film is painful to experience.Why are the songs so bad? Well, the lyrics are stupid and trite. To call the simple-minded rhyming scheme and gimmicky wordplay 'doggerel' is to render grievous insult to all self-respecting doggerel. I am now thoroughly convinced that Sondheim had experienced a stroke or something before he sat down to write these lyrics.What complements dismally bad lyrics? Putrid music, and in this film we have it served up in large, heaping portions. The amazing thing is, the music isn't even memorably bad. It's just sonic drivel. Imagine your least inspired high school notebook doodling rendered as music. This was worse.This is a musical, mind you. Not that you're likely to forget, as the characters almost never stop singing. But in a musical, the songs should be a strong point. We can forgive weak plot devices and even some throwaway characters if we love the music. The music in this film is just painful. That judgment extends to the performances, as well. The singing was dubbed in (no crime in that -- it is a movie after all.) But if you're going to dub the songs, why not attempt to get good performances from your actors? Or hire specialists with listenable voices to do the singing. I would pay money to be assured of not ever having to listen to any of those performers sing ever again. Not that they were off key -- it was just the timbre and stylistic awfulness that put me off. Chris Pine -- really? We've got young Captain Kirk standing there, tearing his clothes in a waterfall singing a song that's supposed to be funny and all I can think of is: ""My god, I'd rather see Shatner sing that song!"" I'm not even going to go into plot (stupid) script (pointless and amateurish) sets (boring) costumes (uninspired) and general acting (underwhelming to pitiful.) No, I reserve my final comments for the director and producers: Have you no shame, sirs? In the immortal words of Sméagol: ""Go away, and never come back!""",Into the Woods
434,petersjared41,Nice adaptation,8,9 February 2015,"The cast in this is brilliant, their performances make this film delightful. There isn't much more to say other than ""Meryl Streep"" who brings her talent, amazing level of authenticity and perfectionism as the Witch in this film. I loved Chris Pine who's arrogant portrayal of the prince is quite humorous and engaging. He does a much better job in this than in his previous films. There are a lot of amusing moments and unexpected humanity that shines through in the script without being overdone. This really is a great adaptation and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is not your typical Disney fairy tale film and I think it is all the more for it.",Into the Woods

I love dark kids movies, like Studio Ghibli, Alice in Wonderland and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I hate this movie because it's a boring, stupid, bloated excuse of a movie with awful songs and flat out random events. The only reason this isn't 1 out of 10 is because the cast redeems it somewhat and it has some nice visuals. Act 2 in its entirety is stupid and unnecessary, and what makes it worse is it could have been great had this been for an older audience. They could have truly played around with the really messed-up parts of fairy tales. Instead, we get a movie that is tantalisingly close to how we want it, but falls short. Very. Very. Short.EXCEPT IT ENDS UP BEING TOO BLOODY LONG!!! Anyway, to conclude, Into the Woods is a confusing, idiotic mess that pretends to be this dark, gritty kids movie but just becomes another cringeworthy musical with some sexual overtones.",Into the Woods

437,atravelingman,Could've been great... should've been great!,5,18 August 2016,"First things first. The film Into the Woods is based on a musical play of the same name with the same writers, so it obviously is a musical film. Having said that, I can understand where the people are coming from that did not know that, or didn't know about the play, going into the film. It is foolish and dumb to call them ignorant, they obviously would have checked the movie genre on IMDb as well and strangely it does not say musical there either, so why should they be expected to know it when there is no clue pointing them to it.Now, Into the Woods movie is fun, beautifully acted and gripping, that is until about after half way through. The play is divided into acts, and the movie was carrying its own and then some till the first one. I'm not going to compare the movie and the play as some others have done and say well this can't be different than that because it is ""the law"". Nope. My quip with it is not that, but instead it is that suddenly the movie shifted, but not quite. After delivering so much promise, it suddenly and quickly became a bit cringe worthy. I'll leave it at that, as I'm definitely not telling people not to watch it. In fact quite the opposite, I encourage you to watch it and experience the music, the acting, the situations etc. all by yourself. You'll perhaps love it even more than I did, and believe me, I did love it hence the 6 in rating.The acting was great, as it should've been with the stellar cast on hand. Meryl Streep was, well, Meryl Streep; simply brilliant. You might by now know that Anna Kendrick has a beautiful singing voice as well, she really does. But out of all of the actors, I found the sweetest voice and the best delivery of emotions came from Emily Blunt. She shines in this, brightly as ever.All in all, a decent experience.

441,GazDutlow,An exquisitely crafted musical,9,5 January 2015,"http://whatdidgazthinkof.blogspot.com.au/2015/01/into-woods.html For the third night in a row, Cinderella is fleeing the King's festival. But what's this? Her Prince has spread tar on the steps of the palace, in an attempt to stop her leaving his side. With her slippers getting stuck more by the second, she is faced with a dilemma: Is she ready to leave all that she's ever known? And if she does leave her dreary life for one of royalty, would it be everything she anticipated? While watching 'Into the Woods', you may feel like Cinderella. Scene after scene will roll, and you'll have to decide whether you're ready to leave the sugar coated fairy-tales you know behind. If you have never gone 'Into the Woods' before, you may not be getting everything you wished for. What you'll get is an exquisitely crafted musical, that forces you to think about the moral complexities of seemingly simple tales.The movie follows a Baker and his Wife (James Corden and Emily Blunt) as they gather four magical items from famous fairy-tales. They wish to reverse the curse a Witch (Meryl Streep) had placed on their family tree so they can have a child. Their adventure will see them collide with characters who also have wishes; Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) who wishes to go the ball; Jack who wishes to save his cow; and Little Red Riding Hood off to see her grandmother.All of this is in the capable hands of director Rob Marshall, coming close to the heights of his superb 'Chicago'. His nuance for handling musical material is put to the test, and he juggles a superb cast and beloved Broadway material better than the he did with his clumsy 'Nine'. He draws out some remarkable performances; from Meryl Streep, in a role that fits like a glove; and from Emily Blunt, who finds the perfect balance of humour and emotion the story calls for.The supporting cast is strong for the most part; Chris Pine rakes in the laughs with his less-than-sincere Prince Charming. It is only Johnny Depp as the Wolf who fails to dig his teeth deep into a role that calls for seduction. The metaphor for sexual awakening is lost to one of pedophilia, partly due to the too young Lilla Crawford (as Little Red who has ""strayed from the path"").Parents of young children may have read that last sentence and scratched their heads. As the Witch notes, many people nowadays are looking for a nice film; not good, not bad... just nice. Perhaps look elsewhere. Isn't this Disney? In terms of its excellent production, indeed it is. But all credit for this twisted tale must go to Stephen Sondheim, the man behind musicals such as 'Sweeney Todd'. His original Broadway production has found a new life and an audience in a new generation. Yes, the 'Woods' may be a little too dark for its PG rating, but it's a film that has separate lessons for it's adult and adolescent audiences.So be careful what you wish for - although this tale begins with ""Once upon a time..."", the happily ever after may not be sweet enough to satisfy your wish. But if you're wishing for a great movie, consider your wish granted! 'Into the Woods' is in Australian cinemas January 8.",Into the Woods

443,lorenzogary,I Know Things Now (That This Movie is Pretty Good),8,30 December 2014,"When I first heard that there was going to be a musical that intertwines the Brothers Grimm fairy tales and follows into the consequences of their wishes, I was intrigued. Coming out of the theater after the credits rolled, I have to admit that I wish, more than ever, that I didn't leave the woods...The one thing that stands out to me the most was the casting; Emily Blunt did a phenomenal job as the Baker's Wife (who knew she could have such a voice!), Meryl Streep never fails in her acting and singing, and Chris Pine did a so-bad-it's-good performance of Prince Charming (he was a jerk in moments, but that was all in good play as I felt that it was a tip of the hat to all princes in fairy tales).Now, I didn't expect this movie to have so much music; the movie begins with a fourteen minute song of a prologue. There was about 65% singing and 35% talking lines, but the songs were somewhat catchy. Songs that stuck to me were ""No One is Alone"" (as the remaining characters sing in grief of those they have lost) and just about anything Meryl Streep sang (""Last Midnight"" was honestly my favorite tune from her!).From a subtle Act I to the tremendously tragic Act II, 'Into the Woods' was an enjoyable movie.

Disney has always found its way into our hearts and rooted there, with its beautifully told stories and stunning visuals.Last year, I thought 'Frozen' was an exceptionally exhilarating experience in terms of musical genre movies. I don't quite fancy this genre really, but the filmmakers and the whole music department have done a great job showing how appealing a good musical movie can be. The Oscar winning 'Let it go' by Idina Menzel was nothing less than a masterpiece.Now speaking of 'Into the woods', it was the exact opposite. The music was lame, the characters as well. Not even a single character delivered a genuine performance. The word 'poor' is too generous to describe the script and the acting, though there are many fairy tales in this movie that we grew up loving. It was so bad that I couldn't stop fidgeting the whole time.Maybe the only reason I give it 3 stars is because of Meryl Streep. It is always good to see her. Unfortunately, this could be the only movie that I watched for her and she did not excel in.One last advice, if you really want to spend a good time with your kids, take them to the park or just do anything else entertaining.

I was particularly enchanted by Anna Kendricks' Cinderella and Chris Pine's Prince. Emily Blunt was also very good in the pivotal role of the Baker's Wife, as was Meryl Streep as the Witch (of course).The musical numbers were beautifully staged and performed, too, from the sparkling ""Into the Woods"", ""Agony"", ""Giants in the Sky"", and ""On the Steps of the Palace"" right through to the end.Faithful to the original material (both the historical fairy tales and the stage show), there are dark moments in the woods, as well. Besides the (largely off-screen) killings of a couple key characters, there are the Stepmother's Procrustean solution for fitting the Stepsisters' big feet to the slipper (not gory, but certainly true to the original fairy tale) and the Baker's Wife's indiscretion with Cinderella's Prince - but, come on, it's Chris Pine . . .Side note: I definitely thought the film deserved its PG rating, and I was surprised to see parents bringing pre-teens (some pre-school!) to the show. When I was a kid, ""PG"" meant I would see the movie over my parents' dead bodies (!), not ""fun for the whole family, let's take the kiddies"" :/All in all, ""Into the Woods"" is a delightful adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical, and I can't wait to add it to my Blu-Ray collection :)",Into the Woods
448,JuicedIn,"Paved With Good Intentions, But So Is The Road To...",3,3 January 2015,"I avoided reading any reviews before seeing this film, so I'd have no expectations or prejudices. And in the opening moments, I thought I'd been rewarded. This was clearly nothing typical from Hollywood. The characters in period dress, singing their dialog, and the surprise of seeing Tracey Uhlman! I was delighted to see her attached to this project. It bode well! The camera focused on the actors, and not the CGI. Since I knew nothing of the story, I wondered if it would be another LES MISERABLES. But as it unfolded, the ""sing-song"" lyrics that I hoped would evolve into grand musical numbers got a bit tiresome, and a slow leak began to hiss from my enthusiasm. It needed more...something. OK, so we've been introduced to childhood fairy tale themes, and maybe they're going to weave them together somehow. Well they attempted to, but not in an imaginative way. Merle Streep as the witch. I thought there might have been a dash of Margaret Hamilton in her initial appearance, but no...Streep was taking it elsewhere. The first glimmer of genuine music came with Johnny Depp as The Big Bad Wolf. Cheesy makeup, but I can overlook that, the scene still works. I thought Chris Pine as the Prince was the stand-out performance. My guess is that this characterization is what the screenwriters had in mind for the entire project...funny, hammy, over the top, but enjoyable. And consistent. But the other characters, with their occasional surprisingly bad dialog, never attained it. Streep's performance became irritating. The other characters bounced between light comedy and out-of-place drama. I gave up any hope of this being an actual musical, and over half-way through, the sing-songy dialog ceased all together, for no apparent reason. It was like the assistant director took over while the big guy went to lunch. Eventually, we the audience stumbled out of a forest of confusion, and see what looks like the end of the story. I resisted looking at my watch the whole time, and thought, well that wasn't bad, but...wrong. The story plunged back into an irritating forest of heavy-handed seriousness, with thorns of what again attempted to be musical dialog. I had had enough. This could have been spin on the PRINCESS BRIDE, but it got LOST (somewhere) IN TRANSLATION. On the plus side, I was impressed that this thing got the green light from an industry that loves formulaic stories that at least promise to get production costs back. I hope they will with this one.

Sorry, but in Germany the original musical is not very well known. I am not particularly fond of musicals and I really have a hard time with the type of musicals that have no spoken dialogue. Although I really liked Les Miserables. But here the constant singing was super annoying. I almost left the theater. Maybe I would have hated it less if at least the songs were any good.

If you look at the publicity Disney did, they released clips of Meryl Streep performing Stay with me. And the trailer features the Into The Woods song. Second: for those complaining about the content not being for kids: is a Sondheim musical. Yes its dark and its meant to be that way. But its toned down from the Broadway play and its rated PG (parental guidance suggested) so if your taking your kid to a PG, look into it first. Thats why its not rated A. And yes get that the cut the stepsister toes and there's adultery, but in Sleepijg beauty a man kisses a woman without her having any means of defense, in Lion King a lion kills his brother and if you look into any Disney film there's something not appropriate for children. Now as far as the movie: Loved the performances. Specially Meryl Streep and Anna Kendrick. Daniel was awesome too. It is quite enjoyable but its a little too long for me. I wanted it to end about 30 minutes before the ending. It wants to be funny as the original Broadway production but doesn't get it right and the agony song is painful to watch. The voices are great tho. The problem i saw with it is that while toning down Act II, they missed its plot and therefore it was a little too long.

The result was UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT.It is a rare phenomenon that a movie could be so mediocre with so many good actors working in it. Dragging a musical movie for almost 2 hours and that too without a strong story line made it apparent that this movie was made just for the sake of making a movie.As far as acting is concerned, it was good.

454,aaronbenwell,Brilliant film! Funny story filled with morals.,9,14 January 2015,"I have come to see this is either a love it or hate it film. I'm unsure why but it just seems to be the way it is (maybe it was die to the MASS amount of songs... more of an opera type affair than a musical). I personally, along with my partner, loved it. It has a great cast, is funny and follows the tales and fables we have all grown to love.The first hour or so of the film links together fairy tales such as Cinderella and Jack and the Bean Stalk etc and brings the characters to their happy endings. However the rest of the film carries on and shows us that really our dreams aren't really what we want, or need, but instead the in between. We don't need to be in the 'woods' all the time, but wander in and out, taking the exciting with the mundane. It also uses lots of metaphors to tell a tale of how children need to be taught not right from wrong, but to understand different views of others; what is right for one person may be wrong for another; learn from mistakes and hope the next generation takes on what you learnt.However, I would say I personally would take my child to see it; the fairy tales follow the rather dark side of the stories (especially Red Riding Hood's Wolfs part, although brilliantly acted) but mostly due to the film being a little long. The songs are catchy, the princes are over the top and over all it is great fun, heart felt and brilliantly and lovingly made.",Into the Woods

A lot of terrible things happen to many deserving people and it wasn't fun. I hope everyone realizes that there were two honest people who didn't suffer in the end. The other murdering and thieving people got their comeuppance. The moral of the story gets somewhat lost. This should not be rated PG and is not for kids (especially under 9) as they would not understand all the wrongdoings and there is quite a bit of mild violence. It was, however, well acted. We considered leaving part of the way through; we wish we had.",Into the Woods

What I liked the most was towards the ending; Everybody blamed at each other for why things went wrong, but at the end they all realized that it's not just someone's fault and that nobody is innocent. I think it was a beautiful meaning and how even a witch and a giant (who are presented as evil in children's books/animated movies) are not worse than we ""normal"" people are.

457,DeathOnHoliday,"too much kiddie fluff, not enough of the dark stuff. a Broadway classic neutered by Disney.",5,11 January 2015,"I've always loved this musical, but to me, the real story always began with Act 2. Act 1 was the familiar fairy tales wrapped around the baker and his wife. Act 2 is when the characters, and audience, are set adrift. That to me has always been the real story, with the first act mainly an enjoyable, well-crafted prelude. It's no wonder so much attention and time was devoted to the more family-friendly fairy tales of Act 1 for the film, this being a Disney production after all, but by doing so they ruined the actual story. Maybe 'ruined' is a strong word, let's go with 'hampered.' On stage at the start of Act Two, time has passed, and the main characters are happy having gotten their wishes, but still not quite content. Then Mrs. Giant comes down, shatters their sense of security, and sends the characters back into the woods. Nobody has any idea what they should do, the royal family is useless, the witch has no powers, they kill the narrator, and then they start dying off one by one. To me, the best part, story-wise, is the beginning of Act 2 up until the end of Last Midnight. All of this was either skipped over, condensed, neutered, or rushed through in the film, which is a shame because it's what made the stage musical so good. Not having a narrator is understandable, but on stage his death really drove the point home that no one knows what'll happen next. Instead of the narrator getting killed off, this film just turns depressing real quick. There's no real sense that these characters are now on their own. They just go through the required motions so they can sing the songs they need to sing. There's hardly any confusion, argument, death, and fear among the characters after the giant arrives in the film, and so much great dialog, especially for the witch, is just gone. With the omission of the 'Agony reprise,' where the princes sing about their new loves, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, it isn't made clear that the princes still chase women even though they'd just been married. So when the prince and the bakers wife get together in the film, it's no longer a serial womanizer seducing a naive housewife, instead it's a new mom who had a baby hours ago and a newlywed prince hooking up, and it made them both look like idiots. Rapunzel and her prince just riding off and never returning was absolutely ridiculous for a movie. Sure, she didn't have to die in the movie like she did on stage, but to introduce her as the bakers long-lost sister and then not fix the plot to have them interact at all is strange on film. On stage, by Rapunzel going nuts and getting stepped on, the witch was pushed to the end of her rope. This drives her anger during 'Last Midnight,' which ultimately costs her her own life. In the movie, the witch could have found a way to find Rapunzel since she'd only taken off on horseback, and was not crushed to death. In the film, 'Last Midnight' comes off as the witch being annoyed by the baker + friends, instead of the witch angrily giving up on everything. Giving Johnny Depp so little to do in the movie must have seemed strange to people who'd never heard of the stage play. What if the filmmakers had figured out a way to keep him around for more well into the second act? I also always thought it would be interesting to see one of Cinderella's family redeem themselves somehow. A problem with the stage version is that too many characters are introduced in Act 1 who have no real purpose in Act 2. The wolf, granny, Cinderella's dad, the stepmother, the stepsisters, Jack's mom, Milky White, Rapunzel and her prince could have been utilized better on stage, instead of shunted off until the finale number. The film could have fixed these plot problems to give the story a more satisfying cinematic rhythm. On film a story can breathe in a way it cannot on stage. But instead of expanding the story to take advantage of the cinematic medium, they managed to reduce it and make it far less engaging. At least all the songs were good.",Into the Woods

459,comsatteur,It's good but it's better left onstage,10,18 December 2014,"I was a huge fan of the original Broadway musical and when I found out that they were making a film version of this beloved Sondheim/Lapine-musical, I was crazy excited. I'm not going to critically analyze this film because I know you already know that with this A-team cast and creative team, the film is going to be spectacular. I'll just clear up some confusions and mild criticisms. First of all, I agree with most reviews that the latter half of the film felt off, especially for those who aren't familiar with the source material. This is most likely due to their decision of cutting The Narrator character from the stage musical. The death of the narrator was an essential turning point in the musical; he's supposed to be the one guiding the characters in their story, but after he died, things went wrong (like the Prince's affair with Baker's Wife and the Giantess thing). Also, I was disappointed that the show's act finale/opener, Ever After and So Happy were cut, although I get it due to cinematic restrictions. Ever After and So Happy juxtaposes the two acts, whilst expressing the characters' perception and doubts of a happy ending. I was also saddened that many viewers (and reviewers) didn't found Sondheim's songs as astounding, lacking the ""catchy"" factor, which they also found in the film version of Sweeney Todd. While it's understood that Sondheim's labyrinthine score isn't for the general film audience, the genius of his music and lyrics is incomparable and deserves more commendations that it will never get from film adaptations of his films. That being said, Into the Woods is an overall fun and spectacular film (clearly a contender for the upcoming awards season), but like I said. It's better left onstage.",Into the Woods

The film is static, moribund and turgid. All of the irony and wit of the Broadway show is gone. The direction is stilted and boring. Rob Marshall is no Arthur Freed (the producer of the glorious MGM golden era of musicals, a composer and in the pantheon of the Great America Song Book and behind the scene director the films he produced). Whose smart idea was it to cast actors with no Broadway or West End Musical experience save Crawford. Emily Blunt, Chris Pine Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp instead of those capable of performing in a Broadway Musical! Ridiculous.

My mistake. I will never hear the end of this.. I loved Meryl Streep and Johnny Depp but I plan write him a letter about his portrayal of a pedophile. Which as it turns out was the least of the movies problems. The song between the two hero men was the most ridiculously funny thing I have seen in years and would be OK, had it not been a cheap sexual battle between two men who were meant to appeal to young girls, by Disney.I did get the message of the movie and the deep contradictions, however, they were portrayed in such a way they were offensive, even to those wanting to like the movie or hoping for more. Even though I love musicals, I was put off by the songs which weren't needed every 15 minutes. IT is a dark fairy tale which could have had a much better story line and far different ending which was somewhat twisted.

The music is forgettable throughout and not single tune stays with you. Although it claims to be 124 minutes it feels much MUCH longer. THis is a dreadful, dreadful movie and whoever at Disney put their stamp of approval on the script, the director and the soundtrack should really be working somewhere else, perhaps driving a Disney resorts bus.

Apart from the one song which is a little bit annoying after a while, the beginning and middle were OK but the end was awful. Don't take the children if you want them to keep the feel good factor they get from fairy tales.

I was pleased to find that despite Disney putting it's name on the film, the musical was not censored too greatly - which I think is what some people who disliked the film didn't expect. Really, as with all movies, KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.The acting and singing is overall very good for all of the characters and I have absolutely no issues in that regard. For fans of the original musical Into the Woods, the first act is very faithful to the original. The second act makes some notable changes, and is a little clumsy, but I've always considered the second half much worse than the first.

Initially I liked the idea of a dark take on fairy-tales, and was enticed by the star cast! but don't be fooled by the trailer!! As soon as I sat in my seat and the opening song begun I wanted to dieThe singing was appalling. Screeching, overly loud, yet boring non memorable songs that rhymed for the sake of rhyming and had no meaning to them whatsoever. Literally it was like 'talk singing' they just sung every single line of the whole film in the same monotone or, in Anna Kendrick's case painfully SCREETCHY tone. Little red riding hoods character was the most annoying I have ever come across in my whole life and her singing was appalling and went right through you, I was wincing when she sung it was that bad. The plot made NO SENSE. It was ridiculous. The baker and wife had to find these random items to feed to a cow?? so they went off on a search, yet this search takes place in the same set, a amateurish looking 'woods', and they coincidentally run into each other all the time? the dialogue and scenery, everything taking place in the same stretch of woods- it really really reminded me of rushed and badly acted primary school playoh lord I cant even describe to you how terrible this film was! I ended up enjoying it because it was funny, funny because it was so painfully bad! I went on a toilet break after about 15 minutes and just sat in the toilet on my phone for 30 minutes or so listening to the radio because that was genuinely more enjoyable than the film.When I came back they'd found their items and fed it to the cow? but they didn't have the right hair to feed to a cow so instead they fed it hair off of a piece of corn? corn has hair? I mean WHAT? so bizarre?! then things got progressively worse.. just as I thought it was over, a badly made CGI giant starts walking around, jacks mother randomly gets pushed over onto the floor and dies? OK? very believable...! Emily blunt, who is married and has just lifted the curse and had a baby, then randomly decides to have sex with a stranger, the newly married prince, up against a tree behind Cinderella's back? then she just without warning falls off an imaginary cliff that the audience can't see and dies... Jack takes the scarf off dead Emily blunt then runs to the baker with the scarf and says to him that he stole it off his dead wife's body?! and nobody cares or grieves? the acting is terrible and the plot does not flow and is random and ridiculous and makes no sense.Oh and don't forget about the scenes with Johnny Depp as a disturbing pedophile wolf and birds pecking out peoples eyes and slicing off girls toes and heels. Oh and Meryl Streep's character has enough half way through and randomly starts screaming and turns herself into a pile of mud. AGHHHHHHH bearing in mind this is all happening THROUGH SONG! THERE IS NO TALKING ITS ALL SINGING AND NOT EVEN SINGING ITS JUST MAKING A SELECTION OF WORDS THAT DON'T LINK TOGETHER AND AREN'T RELEVANT RANDOMLY RHYME AND TRYING TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A SONGPlease trust me and don't watch this film. Its not worth your money! listen to all the 1* reviews posted on here and don't waste your time - it is truly awful the worst film I have EVER had the misfortune of watching in my 20 years of life.

How many kids do you know that would sit through a full opera?The second point I would like to make is that this is not a classic Disney tale. It is a concocted tale which tries (unsuccessfully in my opinion) to merge elements from an number of true classics into a new tale.While the idea may have some merit, it is not really big screen material, nor is it particularly entertaining.I have given 3 stars for effort, but unless you are into opera (not sung by professional opera performers), or basically the artistic side of it and not concerned with entertainment (for your or your children) then I would give this a miss.Another reviewer wrote ""this is no Frozen"", and he/she could not be more correct.

471,caitlinberrill,Not as bad as everyone says!,7,30 August 2018,"Right, I usually don't write reviews but someone needs to set the record straight here! Yes, this film is a musical, yes, it has adult themes but what were you expecting? I honestly am surprised at the amount of people that don't do a little research before going to see a film to see what it's roughly about. Although maybe Disney shouldn't have been the company to take on a musical like this as they're a company that primarily caters for a younger audience, they did their best to tone it down and still say truthful to the original story. It isn't as if Disney has never dealt with mature themes before. Whilst there is an instance where Johnny Depp's character, the Wolf, sings mildly suggestive lyrics (which are likely to go over most children's head's anyway) about eating Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandmother and some kissing between the Prince and the Baker's Wife (they are not married to each other but married to other partners so it is technically adultery), it really isn't that extreme. But moving on from that, the acting and the singing can't be faulted. Meryl Streep puts on an incredible singing performance and so does Johnny Depp which I was surprised about. Chris Pine puts on a very funny performance as the Prince. Other than him though, the comedy is lacking a little. The original production is a lot funnier.

We don't need pessimistic films that try terrible plot twists to be ""different"" and ""unique"". There is no such thing as 50 shades of grey. There's a right and wrong, we can know this both from God and from scientific study. From a studio that promotes the sanctity of families as the cornerstone of society and something to be cherished, this film is hypocritical. We see the Baker's wife unfaithfulness, and it's all played for laughs. It's sickening. Cinderella sings to Jack ""You decide what's right, you decide what's good."" This is a lie. We do not decide what is right.Witch: You're so nice. You're not good, You're not bad, You're just nice.Anything that promotes moral relativism is poison to society, corrupting our minds to the point of brutes and animals, driven by passions and desires, running wild with ""what feels good"" and ""what I like"".

None of the other characters were memorable at all. And when one of those characters is played by Tracey Ullman, there's a problem.

If you've never seen the play, I can see why you might think so... but she did horrible.By far the most underwhelming performance of the baker's wife.. ever. So many moments in the play where Joanna Gleason would deliver a line that would just make you laugh. Then along comes Emily, who just plainly blurts out the script with no attempt of retaining the original humor and the moment (no pun intended) is lost.Overall I enjoyed the movie, but the play is much better. While the movie had some standout singing performances (Giants in the Sky/Your Fault/Last Midnight were done so well)... there was just far too much was cut out of Act II. Most importantly Rapunzel's entire story arc... and one of the best songs in the entire play: Agony Reprise.I think Disney tried sooo hard to make it family friendly to fit their brand, that they completely whiffed on some of the more important points.This play was originally based off of the Brothers Grimm tales... not the children stories Disney interpreted them into.They should have created the film without censorship or worry about time restraints, and this could have been amazing.

Plot holes and unresolved threads everywhere.The johnny depp part....How?? Why???

I blame the director for choosing such lousy camera angles (is the director 10 yrs old or something?) and allowing such thoughtless line deliveries (the actors sound like they're just reading through the script for the first time and haven't rehearsed at all), the casting director for picking people who can't sing (I don't like to say mean things about children but I never want to hear anyone bellowing like that Red Riding Hood character ever again - yelling is NOT singing!!! - and what's with all the rrrrrrrrrrrrr's?!! Her singing teacher should be taken out and shot!), and the composer (more like decomposer!) who wrote the dreary tuneless repetitive crap that passes for music in this production.

It shows you sometimes people do the wrong things for the right reasons. Good movie to take your kids to so they come out with maybe learning something like right from wrong and everyone makes mistakes. Do not stray away from the right thing because it can take you into bad places. Its sort of a musical and play format yet its a movie. Too many negative reviews about this movie in my opinion.

How could you not know that it was...this musical's been around for nearly THIRTY YEARS NOW! Ahem. Okay, yes, it has dark elements, including references to pedophilia. THIS WAS IN THE ORIGINAL MUSICAL! In fact, Disney toned it down severely! Horrible score? Tell that to Sondheim - he wrote the pieces (and won awards for them)...sigh. Some people just don't ""get it"".This is the first film adaptation of ""Into the Woods"". Several others had been contemplated, worked out, even started casting for, but this is the only one that was ever completed...NOT because it was ""horrible"" ""awful"", or whatever, but because it was such a daunting task! I thought that this movie was a wonderful work of art that addresses a lot of life issues (after all, Sondheim is also a noted psychologist). Others were upset that it was a musical. Oh, boo-hoo. People are singing their lines. How un-Disney-like.Okay, I will agree with one point: It is NOT your typical Disney fairy tale. Nope. Not at all. Instead, it's more true to the original Brothers Grimm stories...let me repeat that...true to the original Brothers Grimm...if you don't know what I'm speaking of, if you think Snow White was about dancing dwarfs and tweeting birds, then you really need to visit a library.People are screaming up and down that this is most definitely NOT a family film. Um...hello? Do you even know what ""PG"" stands for? It means ""Parental Guidance suggested""...this means that you, as a parent, should decide if it's right for your child to view. In other words, BE A PARENT! Sheesh...Okay, enough of that.""Into the Woods"" is a musical.

You just need to be in the proper frame of mind. I knew what I was getting into, and I loved it.

After 20 minutes she was beginning to look annoyed at the god awful singing, by this point I wanted to destroy the screen if only to get rid of the little red riding hood character.After roughly an hour we found other things to do (each-other), this lasted for roughly 40 minutes or so. Usually when this happens we will wind a film back to where we'd left off in order to pick up the plot from where we'd become distracted. This wasn't necessary in this case as no plot was there to be lost.I only gave this film 1 star as it's not possible to go for a -10/10.Don't waste your time on this one, paint a wall, watch it dry, it'll be more fun!",Into the Woods

Those expecting the 'Disneyfied' versions are, obviously, not familiar with the often dark subject matter of the original Grimm fairy tales. Don't get me wrong; I love conventional Disney...however ""Into The Woods"" predates the Disney do-overs and covers all the original 'raw' bases and I applaud that. If you take the time to read the original Cinderella, Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood, etc., you will appreciate ""Into The Woods"" authenticity. I quite enjoyed the film and its music.

As well as unengaging, poorly paced, ugly, needlessly theatrical (this stage musical is unconvincingly transferred to screen) especially in its 2nd half. It's 'dark humour' is woefully misjudged and leaves a sour taste. Maybe Tim Burton could have handled the source material more successfully?Plusses?

493,benzalkionium,Never been so happy to see credits,1,15 September 2016,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I think it is probably because I went in expecting to like it. There are worse movies, such as Battlefield Earth, or maybe I should say equally bad movies, but I like dark fairy tales, I like musicals, I love most of the members of the cast, and I was expecting to enjoy the movie. I didn't, at all! The singing is awful. That is the worst part of it. It is droning and relies so much on rhyme that it doesn't try to make sense or have an impact, and every song sounds the same so it's emotionally like hearing the same line over and over for hours and by the time it is done you feel like you just survive a form of torture, like water dropping on your forehead for days or something that doesn't really damage you... but does. Deep inside. The background is OK, the forest is OK, but everyone's clothes look like very cheap live theatre costumes. It didn't fit well with the ultra realistic CGI. That wasn't that big a deal, except one costume with Johnny Depp was so cheesy I could not forgive it. The PLOT, or ""plot"" is also so very very bad. You have all this stuff going on and it's resolved, mostly, and you think the movie is over... and then you find out it is only halfway over, and wait what just happened why what why did that person die but that person just killed them self and now we are looking for crop circles because Johnny needs more Zyrtec? That's NOT exactly what happened, but it is may make more sense. So I see the higher starred reviewers saying, 'well it is a musical, so its supposed to have singing' - it is supposed to have GOOD singing, and 'well the original play has this plot' - OK then the original play also sucks to an unimaginable level???? Good point? I was standing and slowly walking to the door for the last 1/4 of the movie because I was curious how it would end, like watching a bus of children sink in a lake - so terrible but also weirdly fascinating - but I felt trapped by this fascination and wanted to run out of the theatre and climb a tree, breathe fresh air, just LIVE and not hear ""I wonder whyyyyyyyyyyy, I wonder hoowwwwwwww, I wonder whyyyyyy and howwwwwwwww and wheeeeennnnnnnnnnnnn,"" (everything is constantly repeated in the lyrics just to add to the dramatic effect).",Into the Woods

Some of you had all of the time in the world to write a lengthy review on how adult this movie was and how your children shouldn't have seen it or how you didn't know it was a musical (even though the trailers I saw all had singing), but yet you didn't have the 30 seconds it takes to Google the movie and see that it might not be quite a kids film and that it is a musical? This is not Disney's fault. It is not Meryl Streeps fault. It is yours.

The first half was a charming, family movie. The second half felt like a different movie altogether. After reading up some on the play it seems that what Disney did was take an adult play with very adult themes and try to mush it into a family movie mold so that they could release it for the holidays. The play actually sound likes it would be a better watch as they cut and tweaked so much to give this movie a family rating that they drained all of the life and purpose from it. They should have either committed to an adult fairy tale and stayed more true to the play or they should have just came up with an original, live action fairy tale for the kiddos but they tried to walk a middle line and they failed. There was set-up to events in the second half that were left out entirely, so when the events happen you are left, like the bakers wife, asking yourself ""what just happened""? I read in the trivia that this play had twice before been in the works to be a movie with 2 other studios, besides Disney and I really, really wish that one of those other movies had come through because maybe one of those other studios wouldn't have felt so much pressure to water it down.",Into the Woods

Acting, Meryl Streep did a great job, but even she couldn't save the soundtrack or make sense of the jumbled story, Emily Blunt does a great job as the comedic relief, Johnny Depp, in his very short and minimal role on screen reminds me of a child rapist/predator who was just released from prison and spent what little money he had on candy. Miscast plagues the film. Special Effects.. None... Plays out like a play/opera..nothing, absolutely zero special effects worth mentioning which made it hard to get lost or enveloped in the world.

The directing was exciting, and the CGI was fine and this whole world/forest had its feeling.
There were only two things that made me disappointed. One of them are the songs. They weren't that bad just nothing special, nothing that stayed with me after the movie.
The other thing was the plot. After an hour I thought the movie was finishing. And then the whole second part of the movie was like a sequel. And this story is a fairytale, so there is no suprises which made me disappointed.

499,cindysym,extremely disappointing all around,1,18 April 2015,"The trailers and promo for Into the Woods did not come near to forewarning the public of the content. A conglomeration of fairy tales? A new take on an old one? Since I did not know what to expect, I was hoping for a unique uplifting experience, and in fact, the original premise of the storyline COULD have delivered.I expected the acting to be first-rate in this film (and it was with a few notable exceptions), but I did NOT expect such a dreary, depressing, poorly executed storyline, set design (filmed largely in the dark making it very difficult to make out much), costume design, flip-flop directorial moves (Chris Pine's satirical take on Prince Charming was anathema to the rest of the characters, didn't fit at all, but surprisingly was the best part as far as I'm concerned.) Perhaps the whole thing would have been better promoted as ""dark satire on the fairy tale phenomena.""Aside from all that, my biggest problem with the film is the story itself ... it's hard enough for today's kids to get exposure to traditional fairy tales, but to have these old stories dissected, destroyed, and transformed from hopeful (in most cases) teaching opportunities to a completely sour, hapless, depressing interpretation of what used to be a revered part of our collective childhood seems criminal.

Then comes the twist which made me hope that something's interesting is coming but it didn't. While I see what the screenwriter wanted to say - it was done in a terrible way. It's basically 2 hours of singing slogans with no depth. This movie is also very disturbing and not at all what I would expect from Disney.

The music is so lilting, with basic melodies rearranged and reordered to create a dynamic, moving score that crawls into your head and lodges there like one of Jack's magic beans. There is almost nothing about this movie that is typical Disney fare: the good guys do bad things, the bad guys have sympathetic motives, and nothing is happily-ever-after. That's not to say it doesn't have a happy ending... just an unorthodox one. The film's running time of over two hours is long by Disney standards, but slightly compressed for a Broadway production. Each musical number is carefully, beautifully staged; every set piece and choreographed move is great fun to watch. Most of all, besides the technical aspects, the movie is incredibly honest. So honest it almost makes up for five decades of saccharine, unrealistic, decidedly un-feminist Disney tropes. In this movie, Prince Charming is unfaithful. The wicked witch has a more-or-less decent heart. The ""heroes"" are all flawed, and all make mistakes for which they have to atone. To quote Red Riding Hood, ""Nice isn't good"" and sometimes people are ""neither good nor bad, but nice"". Some parents (OK, a lot of parents) were concerned about the moral gray areas in the film. On the contrary, I absolutely loved showing this movie to my kids. They got to see humans making human mistakes, and handling the consequences of those mistakes. They got to see something of truth, honesty, redemption, and not-happy-not-sad endings that are so much of what life is all about.

The story bounced back and forth a lot with some stories not making much sense. Save your time & money!!This movie had a ton of great actors in it, it's just a shame they put their efforts into such a horrible movie. Roughly 85% of this movie consists of songs and every song in the movie pretty much involved the same repetitive ""into the woods"" line with the exception of one or two songs. About 80% of these songs weren't even singing, they were spoken in dialog with a sing-song tone.Judging by the trailer I thought Johnny Depp would be in this movie more than three minutes and I also thought the movie would have some humor in it. He wasn't and it didn't. I suppose the directors didn't want to waste time on a costume that was only being worn for three minutes so it looked like they sent Johnny Depp to the dollar store to find some fur to tape to this hands, gray paint for all over, and some cat ears.I felt as if the directions changed up the stories a bit too much. This is supposedly a family movie but it has several scenes not suitable for children. Some scenes probably made Walt Disney roll over in his grave; scenes involving mutilation of women's feet so that they could fit inside Cinderella's glass slipper, Prince Charming being a cheating jerk, Johnny Depp looking and singing like a complete pedophile, using the phrase ""he raped me"", etc.For the TL;DR people: Don't waste your time or money because you'll be asking for both back if you make it to the end.",Into the Woods

But it really wasn't what I expected and I was unfortunately disappointed after such a promising trailer.I have to say, visually it was superb. I would not be surprised if it was nominated and won several Oscars for costume, design and visual effects because everyone looked fascinating and the whole set was generally amazing to look at. I also thought the idea of different classics entwining was a really good idea but it wasn't done right in my opinion. It started off okay, the singing was alright and it was pretty fun. The story became clear and it was all going alright, not great but it was fun to watch. However, one story line seemed to end with an hour left and from there it got worse and worse.On the last hour there seemed to be no proper story line or direction of the film, it seemed to just be a filler in as they had spare time. I also thought (and this may be because I was getting bored) that the songs seemed to be getting longer and a little more pointless and in the end the singing became to much. It got to the point where you were just waiting for it to end but it never came, it went on and on and on.Overall, this film was not terrible but could have been a lot better. Again, visually amazing and the cast were good and humorous but it went on much to long with a story line that was not relevant and I think the songs were too long.

The story was interesting at first but soon degenerated into a big mess that made little to no sense. Random poor lip sinking followed by a pitiful meandering story line. It's so bad it could be mistaken for a parody of other bad films. Casting the least attractive actress as Cinderella had to be a joke, right? I don't get any of the good reviews except I'm sure everyone in the film has relatives and parents who like to write reviews. I would not even recommend renting this film. Very disappointing. I took my 11 and 13 year old daughters and they really hated this film. Someone owes me fifty bucks.",Into the Woods
510,aldrin_o21,Into the Woods (2015) - A movie not well suited for everyone,4,28 January 2015,"(INTRO) The movie surrounds many trials with a much unexpected events to which even I, have a hard time guessing what will happen next. The story actually revolves with the baker (James Corden) and his barren wife (Emily Blunt) to complete a mission which will reverse a curse that his father put through during the past year of the story. The movie is very fascinating and at the same time, a very slow one which create a dull feeling before reaching its climax. Into the Woods could have shown more bursting story lines in which will not leave viewers with unsolved cases like is Rapunzel (Mackenzy Mauzy) the baker's sister? Well, as far as the movie goes, I only find the thrill of excitement when the movie is about the end. Although it's not that hard to guess what will happen next, some storyline are well handle to viewers imagination and I must say that the movie is not well suited for those who does not expect a more action like events.The movie also shows a relatively fast events that I might say, has nothing to do with the story although the mission was to collect four (4) items which could only be accomplish if the characters such as Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) and Jack (Daniel Huttlestone). The movie could be a little disappointing for in which it follows a facile happenings that connected on how the main character (for me is the baker and his wife, of course) could accomplished the task. Also, I noticed on how the witch (Meryl Streep) easily avoided clashes by turning into some quicksand or anything, I don't really know. Although the movie could go below my actual standards and expectation for the great veteran actor and actresses Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep was in the movie, I have expected more juicy story lines, extravagant issues and very repulsive scene that only the well chosen cast could give. I could have only wish that the story could be well-written just like how well was the music produced.I could finally conclude that Into the Woods (2015) is well devise for children and not for those who will expect greatly because of the casting and the catchy trailer they have released. For now, I will not say it's a bad movie but thinking positively it targets viewers such as kids. With an honest opinion, base on the movie, my reactions & other possible environment that the movie could have targeted, I give this movie 4/10.",Into the Woods
511,laughinggiraffe0,I hate musicals after seeing this,1,31 December 2014,"I didn't know this was a musical. I just saw the Disney logo and the movie poster looked interesting so decided to give it a shot ... Wow. The first 20 mins they sing the same melody over and over. I guess I don't like musicals, so I'm trying to be fair, but this movie's still awful. I'd have a different opinion if the lyrics were clever or funny. But they're not. They're just boring, 99% of the time pointing out the obvious, over and over. Worse, the plot is just a rehash of well known fairy tales. Nothing fresh or original until the toward the end, which is actually the worst part of the movie. Really. It was like the writer just pulled random events from a hat and decided to use them for a plot. And worst of all, the few characters that are interesting are killed off, leaving weak secondary characters that the viewer doesn't care about, but that doesn't stop them from singing unfortunately.",Into the Woods
512,brighidhegarty,Awesome,8,29 March 2015,"Great movie, great cast, and fun music. Great comedy and content for ages 14+. The plot is fun because it's something different than what we usually see from Disney. There is comedy for children AND adults. The ""Agony"" scene between the princes was hilarious. The plot gets a little confusing, but not too bad. For those who didn't know it was a Musical, maybe you should have done a little research. Also, those of you complaining about all of the innuendos, small children don't understand it. Disney even cut out a bunch of scenes and songs that were too inappropriate. Also, cutting heels and toes off is how the original Grimm fairytale went. It's a little shocking for a Disney movie rated PG, I'll admit, but we don't see anything, and the movie isn't rated G for an obvious reason. Finally, those complaining about how Johnny Depp was killed of, Johnny Depp was not meant to be a major character. In the previews they say ""WITH Johnny Depp"". He is not listed as a major actor. The one star rating is more than ridiculous, and this movie deserves at least 6.",Into the Woods
513,sarahm-21121,Don't understand the hate,10,23 April 2015,"I'm going to start off by saying that I don't understand why I'm one of few reviews higher than a 1. I saw the movie with my family, and I loved it! Many people are saying that they didn't know it was a musical; well the movie is based off an actual musical that has been on stage for decades now. If you saw Disney was making a 'Wicked' movie, would you be enraged if they didn't tell you it was a musical? But on to the movie. I found very few flaws that I can name. The acting was superb, and the singers were all wonderfully talented. Anna Kendrick is a personal favorite of mine, but all the others I found had wonderful voices. The songs were catchy, and the plot was enticing. All the reviews are griping about that it deserved a stronger rating than PG, and Disney made this one too dark, but I think that was the purpose (also when has Disney ever shied from dark themes? Look at ANY Disney villains death). PG doesn't necessarily mean your kid might be able to handle it. It just means it wasn't strong enough for PG-13. Know your kids, and do some research. Again, this musical has been out for decades. The violence was pretty toned down in my opinion. I didn't see a drop of blood, and most of the violence was off screen. (SPOILER) For instance, with the stepsisters' feet mutilation, and eye loss, all of it was handled without a drop of blood, and treated in a comical manner. I'm sure your kids (if you have any) have seen how to train your dragon, it's the same concept. Now, I'm not saying that every kid might he able to understand/handle it. It's based on the brother Grimm stories, not the fluffy Disney versions. It's actually handled spectacularly well considering the stories they were based off of. However, if you still think its too heavy, then don't take your kids. Overall, I thought it was done spectacularly well, and I've been singing the songs all day. Don't be daunted by the other reviews, I'd recommend it. If you have kids, be the judge of what they can handle and decide from there. 10/10",Into the Woods
514,theamazingzady,this is sick!,1,24 April 2015,"My Goodness what is Disney thinking. When I think of how far they have degraded from what good Walt Disney was trying to do. What ever happened to Snow White and Sleeping Beauty?? The movies they put out today are sick, demented and disturbingly sexualized.So first Disney pumps out Frozen, a movie with many hidden perversions (some really not fit for children). Obviously, the movie has a lesbian character in it. What kind of Disney princess fairy tale is that? They also bash on men in the movie horribly.Now we have this piece of garbage. What is up with this movie. Disney has literally praised every kind of sexual practice possible in this movie: pedophilia, LGBT and premarital sex and husbands and wives cheating on each other.What freaking kind of hope does that give a little girl to dream someday that her husband will cheat on her!!!!! Really freaking Disney? Prince charming was charming because he was decent and innocent. Hello people! Girls and women do not ""dream"" of being cheated on. Is Disney really hurting so bad that they have to appeal to sick adults and pedophiles.DO NOT let your child see this movie. It is sick, dark and disturbing along with the awful language.I know it's just going to get worse from here because Disney is obviously pushing an agenda. They are trying to appeal to every kind of sexual pervert out there.This movie also treats women like dirt and ""sexual objects."" Literally. It's violent, dark and very, very disturbing. Literally, some scenes will make your heart quiver. I can't imagine what it will do to your child.If you are trying to raise your child decently and keep their innocence in tact do not let them see this movie.Forget Disney. Let them watch some of Dream Works newer movies like Home or the older Disney movies. This movie is just awful.",Into the Woods

Boy were we disappointed. The music, though ostensibly Broadway, was discordant and thoroughly uni-dimensional. The acting was sufficient, if somewhat stilted. The storyline was chaotic and suffering from what appears to be a bad case of 'Too many cooks spoil the soup."" The cinematography is the only positive thing I can comment on - it was visually quite pleasant. Worst of all, however, was the heavy handed moralizing which, barring giving out too many details, tried to normalize serious ethical breaches such as theft, murder, abuse and infidelity.",Into the Woods

517,mikejb-26397,The problem is the music and songs,3,13 March 2021,"The fundamental problem with this movie is the music score. It is just very poor, has pathetic songs and melodies, and is completely uninspiring. There are many movie musicals with very second rate music scores, both regular and animated (are you listening Disney?!), and this is one of them. The composer tries hard to please the listener with an original emotionally moving score, but fails miserably. It is just very poor composition. They needed someone like Rogers and Hammerstein or John Williams. (And Johnny Depp is a marvellous actor but he can't sing!) It's a great shame because this movie, its theme, acting, storyline and beautiful set held great promise.",Into the Woods
518,jaymeelinellis,Beautiful Film Adaption of a Beautiful Stage Play,10,26 September 2016,"Casting is amazing. Singing is gorgeous. Story even better. Okay, first of all, this movie is based on a stage play by Stephen Sondheim. Yes, it has been adapted for the screen by Disney, but that doesn't make it a children's movie. Also, it's a musical, because the stage play was also a musical. If you don't enjoy musicals, don't bother with this movie. It's like going to see Les Miserables and complaining about all of the singing. Seriously. The storyline is based loosely on a number of characters from popular fairy tales - Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk. Plot below. A baker and his wife have been cursed by a witch, as a result of the Baker's father robbing the Witch's garden (original Rapunzel story). To break the curse, they are tasked with finding four items. The search for these items causes them to cross paths with other fairytale characters. They gather the items and part 1 ends with all of the characters appearing to receive their ""happy endings"" as per the usual story. Part 2 takes a darker turn as the path through the woods (and the character's ""expected"" behaviours and stories) is destroyed, and the characters have to live with the consequences of their actions. All in all an interesting story that makes you think about what could have happened after the princess married the prince, and teaches a valuable lesson: ""Careful the tale you tell, that is the spell. Children will listen.""",Into the Woods

It is very disjointed with tragedies to characters whom you do not care about. Why do you not care about them you ask? Because they are flipped and tossed around in a script that provides very little development...not to mention, no one else in the movie cares about them either (except in one instance).The stories that are intertwined are done so in a very lazy way. It is difficult to keep up and you will likely find yourself trying to figure out one story just to make sense of the next. In short, it is jumbled together poorly.In closing, you really never find out what is going on until the end but by that time you have been waiting for the movie to end, it is too late to care.

523,heikeduerr,I knew what to expect and wasn't disappointed,9,13 March 2015,"I'm a big Disney fan and was excited they were making a real life fairytale movie, that seemed to be really magical. But when I saw the first clips and trailers of this movie I thought *WHAT????* - a fairy tale musical? I'm glad I had this *WHAT???* moment before I actually went into the movie, as it took me a while to 'accept' this and adapt my expectations. If I had gone into this movie unprepared, my disappointed expectations would have spoiled a wonderful movie experience, as it did for many of the reviewers who gave negative reviews here.I watched the ""making of"" featurettes, and in that Anna Kendrick (I think) said, that the first part of the movie shows the fairy tales pretty much as we know them, but then the story turns and the characters are faced with the consequences of their actions. So I knew this was different from a regular Disney fairytale.I didn't know any of the songs, so I bought the soundtrack first, to get myself familiar with it - and that was a good move. After listening to the songs a few times, I already had a good idea of the story, I knew it wasn't for little children, and I couldn't wait to see the pictures that went with the songs.So with my expectations adapted I had a great time.***SPOILERS START HERE**** I loved the settings – the old houses, the mysterious fairytale forest that looked real and unreal at the same time.All of the actors did a great job. Meryl Streep – brilliant as usual. With a great singing voice, better as in Mamma Mia. Johnny Depp – a wonderfully creepy wolf singing with an insinuating voice. The dashing princes belting out ""AGONY!"" – everyone in the theater was giggling. A fantastic parody of all the charming princes you have ever seen in fairytale movies or soaps and a great performance – enough over the top to be funny, but not too much to be ridiculous. The children were wonderful and also had fantastic voices. Tracey Ullman and Christine Baranski in small roles as the grumpy mother of Jack and Cinderella's stepmother. Anna Kendrick, who played the indecisive Cinderella, who wasn't sure if she wanted to live a fairy tale. And James Corden and Emily Blunt as the Baker and his wife, who were quite chaotic in their approach to get the things, the witch wanted from them. All of them really memorable characters.I loved the humour, the witty lines and scenes: ""especially the beans"" ""I really hate to ask it, but could I have a basket"" (after Little Red Riding Hood just helped herself to so many free sweets at the baker's shop, that she couldn't carry them all), the belting princes, the scene at the stairs – a split second decision when everything goes wrong drawn out to a 5 minute song. This humour was the spoonful of sugar that made the heavy messages go down without making the whole movie too gloomy or serious.I liked the twist in the second half of the story. Even in a fairytale life isn't always like a fairytale Like in real life, everybody's blaming everybody else. Unlike in the first part, all was very unpredictable. But in the end we do get that happy ending – sort of. However I only give 9 out of 10 points, because I also thought that this ending dragged along for a little too long. One or 2 introspective songs less and it would have done the movie a lot of good. There were more than enough messages in that part. On the other hand, it gave me the chance to sneak out to the bathroom without missing any of the plot. ;-) Altogether, I had 2 very enjoyable hours and still have the songs in my head. And I will definitely buy the DVD or BluRay.",Into the Woods

Probably the live musical was very good, but I haven't seen it and the movie can get really really boring in some parts. Visually, it has very interesting parts and the cast is good, but the singing looks artificial as most movie musicals do (it need to be very good to distract from that). Furthermore, a few parts of the story make us loose interest because they don't make sense.I did not find the songs interesting at all either, they are boring and repetitive. It sounded like the characters were singing the same thing during the whole movie.

Finally I decided to and I can now say I am understanding of the poor reviews, but also can see parts that were actually worthy of praise.The big let down was the missing parts left out from the original musical's story. That leaves the movie in a state of absent scenes which would have completed the plot. A lot of people complained in their reviews the movie made no sense, that is because of the missing pivotal scenes. It also stops the movie from flowing correctly and you find yourself in a place where it's hard to relate to what the characters are going through.This musical movie is no more for a child to watch than Les Miserables is. It is emotional and dramatic in ways only an adult can appreciate. I personally wouldn't let a child watch it. Because it's Disney does not mean it's for children. There's even cartoons Disney has produced in its beginnings that I wouldn't let my child see.Johnny Depp's wolf was not a pedophile, he was a carnivore. A sadistic, animalistic carnivore. He was indeed creepy, but the lyrics included the eating of the grandmother too, which was also creepy. The character is meant to be creepy. No different than the witch who tricked Hansel and Gretel into getting fat and plump so she could eat them.The music is unfortunately a tad forgetful as there wasn't much catchiness or memorable melodies. But it was sung very well and the acting was really good. Streep and Kendrick were phenomenal and Cordon was a believable baker. Pine made a very handsome Prince Charming also and all of this was achieved despite the missing scenes, which is impressive.It's sad that it felt so incomplete as it could have been a masterpiece that I would have loved to watch again.

The story line is confusing at best, and just goes on rambling along like they were making it up as they went along. Don't get me started on the fact that its a musical. I'm pretty sure the songs were added because the story line and script were not long enough to make this a full length movie.

Emily Blunt was also wasted. The Jack and the Beanstalk portion complete with Giant made no sense. Little Red Riding Hood absolutely did not have anything to do with the story. It was just a giant hodge podge of crap. This would have been a decent made for TV movie, but to sit through 2 hours and spend the money I did, I was highly disappointed.

531,thesupervillain-1,Into the Woods is a musical!,9,30 December 2014,"These reviews are hilarious. First of all, yes, Into the Woods is a musical. There is ample enough singing in the trailer for that to be evident and if you still don't realize that then you deserve what you get for going to this movie with that much ignorance. Second of all you also deserve what you get if you took your family to this movie because it's from Disney and you thought it would be suitable for children because of that alone. Disney IS the evil empire after all. They just disguise it well. But yes, this movie is a musical and it's dark and twisted.Here is the crux of the situation. Into the Woods is a metaphor for Stephen Sondheim's lover dying of AIDS. It's about how fairy tales are bullshit and just when everything in your life seems to be perfectly on track, some kind of giant will enter and rip it all down. That's the giant that comes down the beanstalk. It's a metaphor for AIDS. Into the Woods was created in the late 80's in the wake of the AIDS epidemic blowing up. Everyone has giants, life is harsh, and fairy tales are just that...baloney. If you take things for granted, it won't be long until your perfect little world gets trampled by giants.When the original version of this came out on stage audiences were widely upset that it didn't end at the middle when everything was tied up in a little bow and everyone lived happily ever after. They were upset that there was a another act, technically there are two acts, I'm not sure why some people seem to think there are three. They were upset that there was another act that sees the destruction of everything that seems perfect, but that's the point. Everything is not perfect, nothing lasts, it's not a fairytale, and there are always giants that will rip it all down.So pile the kids in the car and go have a good time watching this dark and twisted tale of sadness from Disney, where nothing works out and no one lives happily ever after...oh yeah, and where they will be singing from beginning to end. Maybe you will find some of your own giants.And for those of you who were disappointed that Johnny Depp's role isn't bigger, traditionally Cinderella's prince and the Wolf are played by the same actor. They just cast Johnny Depp as The Wolf to get you in the seats. And actually it's more interesting to have one actor dedicated to The Wolf. So if you're just there to see Johnny, you might have made the wrong choice. Although, The Wolf can steal the show.",Into the Woods

Nor did I expect to see a cheating butchers wife, a suicidal witch both with odd deaths, and the completely unnecessary prolonging of the story with the entire ""she"" giants portion of the extended plot.

533,romtang-2,Get the facts first,6,7 June 2015,"First of all this is a motion picture remake of a musical. For some reason it seems most people are completely unaware of that and have never even heard of musical. . Second, the music is by Stephen Sondheim. If you don't know who he is you must live under a rock. He is a composer and lyricist known for things like Sweeny Todd and West Side Story. It seems like most people think Disney came up with the music for this. Third, these are the original Grimm Brothers versions of the tales, not the edited for children Disney versions. It also seems that a lot of people only know the ""kid"" versions and were appalled that the step sisters get their feet cut and eyes poked out. Read the original stories, that's how they go. The good: I thought it was very well cast. If you've seen the play I think you'd agree. (except Bernadette Peters made a much better witch on Broadway) The vocals were moderately good to great. I really don't understand why people are complaining about the vocals. The scenery and costumes were good. As for turning this into a movie, well... they tried. A for Effort. The bad: This is supposed to be funny!! There is a ton of humor in it which is completely lost in the movie. All the funny lines were delivered seriously which made most of it creepy and weird and most of the movie, boring. Also, they cut out the whole middle of the play! Including some of the best songs. What were they thinking? One major role was completely missing. The ending was changed in several places. Also, if Broadway musicals were rated it would be PG 13. So why in the world did they try to make this look like something for children? Although they toned down a few things to make it more child friendly but it is still not a story for young kids. Overall I didn't think it was as horrible as most reviewers did but I still like the 1988 Original Broadway Cast version (which you can get on DVD) much better.",Into the Woods
534,jellybean_16-1,Extremely Disappointing,3,12 January 2015,"As an avid Disney fan, I was very excited to see this film and was anticipating my usual reaction to Disney's greats. However, this was not the case at all. This film contained some of the greatest fairy tales ever told, yet felt utterly incompletely, unsatisfying and lacking in plot. The acting was fortunately up to standard, with especially James Cordon, Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt giving great performances and, on the plus side, the aesthetics were good, although bordering on a Tim Burton-esque style. Now I have finished all the good things about the film, I can move on to the many things that were wrong with it. The first 20 minutes or so of the film was the longest 20 minutes of my life, sitting through a collage-show of characters all of which showing no distinct personality to cling on to or care about, singing the same four chords over and over again: ""Into the Woods!"" - yes, we get it, that's the name of the film. The songs continued in the same lacklustre musical format, with little or no meaning in when they were sung, what they were sung about or to (they really should have got Alan Menken to do the music... or anyone else in fact). Johnny Depp made an appearance as the Wolf in Little Red Riding Hood, which wasn't surprising given his usual repertoire. However, unlike other performances of his, I was left feeling disturbed and uncomfortable, with the very unsubtle rape undertones in his brief appearance. This is not a film I would show my child; it didn't hit the usual target audience goal as it was inappropriate and dark for children, but just terrible and also slightly disturbing for adults. There were points in the film which seemed strangely comical, and others which really were not. I had difficulty deciphering whether it was meant to be funny or not, but decided it was a serious film when James Cordon failed to make any witty comments about the weird stuff that was happening, and people's feet were cut apart and eyes pecked out in a sadistic, not comical way. All in all, as another user on here has said, don't waste your money. Stay at home, watch the Disney classics and don't bother seeing this one unless you want to be painfully disappointed and creeped out.",Into the Woods

I know this is a bit ruthless, but then again neither Rob Marshall nor James Lapine showed any consideration for my eyes or ears while creating this mess of a movie and it hurts even more as I am a fan of the genre; as I was saying is a bit ruthless but Kym Karath in The Sound of music delivered a better performance in the role of Gretl von Trapp (the youngest one) at that time than Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Johnny Depp tried all together and this comes from a Depp 'follower'. I don't know where all went wrong while making this movie but to end this briefly: Not only it is terrible, it is a terrible waste of time. 1 star from me and 1 from my wife.",Into the Woods

If I hadn't been there with my daughter and her friend, I would have walked out after 10 minutes. It is tedious beyond description from the first minute to the last. The plot is ridiculous and the direction is abysmal. There is no sense of peril. There is no humour. Nobody cares about the characters but above all, there is absolutely no melody to the music. Characters burst into song at every possible opportunity but it just sounds like they are singing random notes. Johnny Depp's character bizarrely plays the wolf as a paedophile which strikes a really jarring note. The whole thing is such a waste of acting talent.",Into the Woods

It seemed like it was 100% singing, and while I do like some musicals, I like dialog mixed in. My wife and I both agreed that it also felt like the movie was about 30 minutes too long. Both of us were hoping it would end soon, during the last bit. I would have also rather them choose a different actress for Cinderella. Anna Kendrick is not very attractive, and I didn't find it believable with her in that role.

As has been said, it's just a meandering two hours and nine minutes of dark fairy tales, muddled and annoying musical numbers, and boring plot development (what there is of it). I can't even come up with a better word than bland. I know it was a 'dark' interpretation of the Grimm Fairy tales, but in reality, it was so boring.

Imagine that!If you are having a problem especially with the last half of this film then you clearly do not understand what the film is trying to say at all. It's a disintegration of fairy tales and a psychological analysis of morality and moral grey areas. It's f'ing brilliant!If you're complaining there are too many songs, then that means you are seeing the songs as just that. ""Songs."" The lyrics are existential and human and carry the plot forward!Johnny Depp came off like a pedophile to you? Well, CORRECT that is absolutely the intention and has always been part of the message of Little Red Riding Hood. Also, how can you argue with these wonderful electric performances, especially from Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt? And everyone has a lovely singing voice, the cinematography, the humor,the music is all so wonderful.This deserves to be rated much much higher than a 6!!This is for people who enjoy and appreciate intelligent, thought provoking films and not your summer popcorn movie escapist crowd.Know that going in, and challenge yourself in the best way with one of the best films of the last several years",Into the Woods

Meryl Streep's character was interesting, as were some others. The forest set did appear like it was on a very small sound stage.The plot?

I think this mix of tales is innovative and interesting, in my opinion is one of the hallmarks of this fabulous story.In my view the forest symbolizes life, as in our life we have ups and downs in the forest was the same. In life there is death, betrayal and pain and that we were shown in the film.""Into the Woods"" has some, but few, failures.

The film thereafter seemed to repeat the exact same tune for the next 2 hours in which seemed like torture. By the end of the film I had concluded that if you watched it muted but with subtitles it would have been a much more enjoyable experience, if slightly not confusing due to the repeated lines in songs. The only song in which I found much pleasure was the song between the two princes, simply because it was so awful and over the top it actually worked!It was hard to discover the story lines behind the music and seemed as though many were irrelevant or unfinished. There were so many opportunities to make the story line better however they seemed to have chosen to ignore them.

However, I enjoyed Into The Woods except for the length. It dragged on slightly. For ppl saying it should be rated PG, EVERY SINGLE FAIRY TALE comes from a horrendous story. All of them contain abuse, murder etc. Into The Woods was a play first and MUCH worse. The Big Bad Wolf is a child molester in the actual play. Saying the movie should be rated R is absolutely ridiculous.. If thats the case EVERY Disney PRINCESS MOVIE SHOULD BE RATED R...

Well, you might for he was hardly in the story but nevertheless the star power was great and the names were huge. The story is sweet and edgy also a big plus that it took more from the original Grimm stories than the previous Disney versions ever dared to do. However at times it did feel like you were trapped in a vast forest without an end. The songs were repetitive, I personally rather have 3 or 4 great songs than 8 of the same, and nearing the end I caught myself praying it was the end and not just another plot twist. I loved the big twist but I felt like they could have left it there and concentrate more on the story of the witch than that of the baker couple. It was an abundance of story lines and not all of them were properly worked out.To Summarize, the movie is like the witches garden: It's vast, it has beautiful scenery and is full of prize winners also like the witches garden the plot was overgrown, stuffed and felt like it needed to be weeded out to give the individual stories some more room to blossom.

But the morals of the story apply to all ages. And ""Children Will Listen"". Yes, there are some hokey bits, but that's part of its charm. Meryl is fantastic! Daniel Huttlestone (also memorable from Les Miserables on screen) has a show-stopper with ""Giants In The Sky"" and ""Agony"" with Chris Pine is a must see for Star Trek fans if for no other reason than to giggle at his affectations of a misunderstood prince. He's fabulous!

I personally like a good fantasy movie, with a prince or two, a princess, a villain, a story and some songs... I've been served well. The only catch is that the songs have the same melody, or at least that is the impression I had!

557,jakerocks-543-217424,As enjoyable as it is flawed.,10,11 February 2015,"Into the Woods is film adaptation of the brilliant Broadway musical of the same name. The story follows an all-star cast as they go into the woods to fetch some trinkets for the Witch from next door. The stage show is by far the most difficult musical to adapt into a film. I actually went to see this movie to watch it crash and burn. Much to my surprise this isn't the train wreck I expected. Turning Into the Woods into a family film is like turning A Clockwork Orange into a puppet show, and for what we got...I kind of liked it. So, what worked? First off, Daniel Huttlestone as Jack. I was VERY impressed with him in Les Miz and was exited to see him get such a large role in such a big movie and he delivered more than anyone else in the cast. His ""Giants in the Sky"" is the only track in the movie that I actually like better than the Broadway version. The rest of there cast pulls their weight and they all sing well enough. Anna Kendrick is perfect in real life as well as in this movie, Streep amazed me, Crawford killed it, Corden and Blunt were awesome, and the music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim were absolutely incredible as always. The problems are in the adaptation. Removing an hour of material and changing character fates really messed up motivation in the second half and created for a pretty sloppy finale that left story arcs uncompleted, characters ignored, and confused the entire message it tried to convey. However, I still loved this movie for the good moments it gave me. If you don't like musicals and/or fairy tales you should stay away from this movie; but if you have any interest or curiosity I'd say it's worth checking out. Into the Woods gets 10/10, solely on the fact that this is as good as an Into the Woods movie could possibly be.",Into the Woods

559,peweller,Not as good as the stage show but it has its moments,6,19 March 2015,"I had to jump on here to clear up so much of the confusion surrounding the 1star reviews. People complaining about the suggestive undertones (adultery, rape, pedophilia). Yes, those are dark thematic elements, but they are not made up for the sake of this movie. Disney has cornered the market on fairy tales with a ""happily ever after"", but the originals were not always so. When James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim set out to write this musical, they mined the original tales from the Brothers Grimm, which are far more dark than the Disney tales we have all be raised on. Fairy tales were originally meant to be a morality tale (don't talk to strangers, obey your parents, avoid illicit relationships, etc.) Little Red Riding Hood WAS a tale about pedophilia, as uncomfortable as that makes us as a modern audience. This was never meant to be a ""happily ever after"" story.Now, to the actual merits of this film. The film was exceptionally well cast (well, except for Chris Pine. I normally love him, but I feel he was a weak link. Cinderella's Prince is one of my favorite characters from the show and I just do not feel he was strong enough). Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt were truly standouts from a very solid cast. Where I take issue with the film is in the transition between Act 1 and Act 2. The first half should end with the loose ends being tied up and the brilliant ""Ever After"" bringing the act to a close. All that is left is the main theme of ""Ever After"" played for a few moments before the giant comes down the beanstalk. There are so many plot holes that are left with the elimination of this song. The second act feels like a muddled mess because we don't really know what happened to everyone. There are too many omissions and the second act feels hurried to get to the end. The whole point of ""children will listen"" is just totally lost. I could go on, but there is no need to rehash the entire stage play. In the original, the second act is supposed to take on a much darker tone from the first; I just feel that the movie missed the mark with this. The film had its moments, but it is far from perfect. However, the 1 star reviews lobbed at this film are not justified. They tried to justice to the source material, but just cut a few too many things to make the story consistent and coherent.",Into the Woods

When I was watching it at the theater I saw many people get up and leave towards the final 20-30 minutes of it from being fed up with the movie because it seems to drag on so long...the end never seems in sight. The concept of the movie is brilliant to entwine so many different stories but the execution was faulty..I know that a musical is supposed to be a slower pace and be about the singing and acting but this had something off about it for sure..definitely off. I'll list some of the things I liked about this movie. *Potential Spoilers ahead*Pros: Visuals are very striking and well done The beginning of each of the characters stories were well done and flowed nicely. The singing was exquisite, the cast is very talented.Cons: Songs were dragged on for too long and lacked a bigger purpose other than to repeat an event or message and slow the plot of the movie.

561,ekaneco,An entertaining musical,8,11 February 2015,"""Into The Woods"" happens to be a very good movie. It could probably be excellent, but it is not.Directed by Rob Marshall, from ""Chicago"", it is a musical full of characters from the fairy tales by Brothers Grimm.Though it is a musical, ""Into The Woods"" sound surprisingly fluent, most for its brilliant songs, and also for its outstanding cast. As always, Meryl Streep has a larger than life presence as the witch, despite all the makeup on her. Irish James Corden again fits perfectly in a film that is supported by music – he is undoubtedly a rising star in his all sympathetic figure. He plays the Baker, who we might say is the main character beside his wife, performed by a highly expressive Emily Blunt. Anna Kendrick can perfectly match her girl next door's beauty as Cinderella, both as maid and as a princess. And Johnny Depp seems to be born to play this irresistibly funny Wolf. Among all these recognizable stars the boy Daniel Huttlestone Daniel Huttlestone calls the spotlight as Jack (the one with the magic beans). Besides the cast, the film also delivers that special feeling of being somewhere out of this world, in this case, the mysterious, thick, humid and deep woods.Nevertheless, ""Into The Woods"" fails when interrupts its fast pacing rhythm after Cinderella's marriage. Though intelligently avoiding to show the adventures of Jack in the land of the Giant and Cinderella's ball in the Prince's palace, from this point it slows the pace. The betrayal act of the Baker's wife is uncomfortable for the viewers, who were sympathetic to her until that moment. The fight against the woman giant seems out of place and its solution is unsatisfying. Moreover, there are two cases of miscasting. First, and most notorious, is Lilla Crawford as the Little Red Riding Hoot – she comes from the Broadway stage play ""Annie"", sings beautifully, but looks very annoying and she can't give a single nice look when on camera. The other case is Chris Pine as Cinderella's Prince, for his exaggerated performance.Therefore, ""Into The Woods"" is a good film. Which is fine and moviegoers will not feel disappointed in watching it. That's a musical far more entertaining than ""Les Misérables"".",Into the Woods
562,DirectorRE,Walt Disney would be ashamed of this!,4,22 March 2015,"My 15 yo daughter and I were mostly enjoying this movie, even with a few cringe worthy moments until well into the second half. The premise of mixing a number of fairy tales into one story with the Baker and his wife forming the central thread was a good one. The Baker was a reasonable bloke with a few bumbling moments along the way who worked out that it's best to work in co-operation with his loving and smart wife, both desperate to break the witches curse and to have a child of their own. There were a number of funny moments as well as drama thrown in. PG it is not. If my daughter were any younger I would have left the theatre in disgust. SPOILER: The recently married handsome Prince meets the Bakers wife in the woods' searching for a young boy. He wants to kiss her as she is brave. She does not resist. CRAP, her character up to this moment does not match with this ridiculous set-up. In 'real life' yes, some people stray. This character would not have done so and would have resoundly slapped the Cad of a Prince. But, Why did he kiss her, this was not part of his characters make up either. The woods did not suddenly become anything different than they had up to that moment. Pathetic writing, save it for an adults movie, but do not dare to mix it into a children's story.

I'm surprised Disney wasted money on this, it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, the singing was mediocre at best, there were actors who could not sing acting was worse and was just a very bad movie all over. Out of 10 I would give it a minus twenty if I could. First of all, it was not advertised as a musical per say, I read there was a song between events, the events ran one after another unfortunately. Secondly, the so called humour was greatly lacking. If I could write a spoiler I would, but then I would have had to suffer to the end of this flick.",Into the Woods
564,jpkelem,"Uh, yeah, it's a musical...",10,30 December 2014,"I'm almost laughing at these reviews...yes, it's a musical(although I suppose the first trailer didn't really show it). Having 'Disney' tacked onto it doesn't make it fun and happy(though, Disney still managed to give almost everyone a happy ending). Don't bring your kids if they don't like these types of movies. My younger cousin, five years old, loved it, my friend's younger sibling hated it. It's not kids in general that hate it; but I hope you know what your own kids like.Anna Kendrick was amazing(as always), she and James Corden in No One Is Alone made me cry. I'll admit, I only knew James Corden from his episodes in Doctor Who...and I got a kick out of realizing in both he struggled with accepting himself as a father, but in the end figured out he could be great. Meryl Streep could literally play any part and be perfect. That is all. Stop comparing her to Bernadette Peters; like most roles, everybody plays them differently, and that doesn't mean one is better than the other. Lilla Crawford was much better than I expected, and I don't know how old she is; but I'm sure she's younger than Daniel Huttlestone(Jack).Moving on to Dan, he was really really good and showcased his talent much better than he did as Gavroche(in the movie--onstage he was brilliant). I think he makes a really good Jack and he still has a wonderful range, despite the fact that he's fifteen--he has the range of a boy soprano. His vibrato hasn't been developed much, but he's only fifteen, and with the vocal coaching I'm sure he's getting, he has a really promising future in musicals and acting in general; the scene where he finds out his mother has been murdered is heartbreaking...and then it leads into a heartbreaking song. One thing, is that I don't think people who saw him in Les Mis realized that he has a natural cockney accent, and at times it's a little hard to understand him. Still, he's amazing.Johnny Depp was sounded like they edited his voice a lot...and he wasn't a very good singer anyway. Emily Blunt, Christ Pine, etc. All the other mains were amazing. I still don't understand why Dan wasn't credited as a ""star"" in the trailer, when he had about five times as much screen time and singing time AND character development as Mr. Wolf, Johnny Depp's character. Ah, well, I suppose they just needed the publicity of a big name...They also cut out a lot of songs and changed it a bit, but even if you've been a fan before the movie, just pretend that you've forgotten the story and are seeing it for the first time. I loved it still.",Into the Woods
565,tiktokofoz,Horrible Mess!,1,28 December 2014,"It's a musical, based on a Broadway play (no really, it's a musical). A misrepresented boring film, how the movie could have received a green light, just shows how little fresh ideas Hollywood has. Okay, am I being too harsh, I'm sure there will be some enjoyable tunes, interesting sets, adorable characters or some interesting twists on stories that really is en vogue at this time. No, No, No, and No! Not one memorable song, how is that possible Stephen Sondheim! Okay maybe it's not his fault, apparently Disney took a PG-13 to R rated play and tried to recreate the movie as a family picture. Where is the millions of dollars in production values? drab, dark sets with deficiency of most color. I wouldn't want to say that the movie has horrible special effects, more an absence of them. A majority of the actors are miscast, it is literally impossible to care about any character. The philandering prince and baker's wife are certainly people, I would want my kids too aspire to be. By the end of the movie, where you have dedicated over two hours of your time, you start imagining how, if all of the characters die, maybe the movie would make sense. Just stick with televisions, ""Once Upon a Time"", for interesting twists on your favorite fairy tales.",Into the Woods

The costumes, the make-up, the scenery is good, but the plot is awful. This movie will corrupt the small kids who were impatiently waiting for another marvelous story for Disney!

This musical was such a disappointment that I had to write a review so you don't fall into the ""This-is-a- Disney-movie-it-should-be-fine"" trap. You would expect a set of catchy songs from a Disney movie...Well, instead of being creative and giving different tunes to each character, the so-called songwriters use the same melody over and over again. You will end up with an ear worm, stuck in your head for at least a week! The lyrics have not wit at all, but I guess they were the same in the original musical. Here is an extract from the Stay with me song: ""stay a child while you can be a child"".... Right. :( The story? It's an utter bore, that's all. After an initial happy ending where one hopes the movie is finally over, it goes on with a disappointing reversal that will make disappear some of the most interesting characters. To make it worse, the plot is slightly misogynistic... The baker's wife is told to stay at home. Rapunzel is clearly clueless. Cinderella even claims ""I actually like to clean sometimes!"". Disney, is that how we want to teach girls they can be brave, powerful leaders? Go on your way....and please stay away from the woods!",Into the Woods
568,clarew_301182,Mishandled Disneyification weakens what could have been an amazing adult musical,6,9 January 2015,"Two things to start firstly spoilers (of both play and film) you have been warned, and secondly please stop talking about this as a kids' film (more on that soon).This film had big shoes to fill as the play is my favourite musical and also it was being produced by Disney which meant there would be an attempt to make it kid friendly which the play is not. When I arrived at the cinema I was a little horrified that the number of small children in the audience, please parents of children research this film before you assume it is fun kid friendly holiday fare...Disney has removed some of the bits that aren't as suitable for children but this musical is beloved by many so they can't remove them all without starting a riot amongst the people who are most wanting to see this film.I have nothing but praise for the cast who were all outstanding (especially Emily Blunt, James Corden, Anna Kendrick, and Chris Pine) and there were massive standout musical moments- namely Agony and A Moment in the Woods. I felt sorry for Meryl Streep who did a solid job but could in no way compete with Bernadette Peters for whom Sondheim wrote the part- for all fans of the musical, Streep was never going to get near Peters.The minor changes of plot, lyrics and script wigged me slightly but were in the first half bearable...my biggest quibble with what was Act 1 of the play is the removal of a standalone narrator, the fact Woods weren't scary enough, and the casting of children in the roles of Red Riding Hood and Jack. There has been some rage by people of pedophilia overtones in Hello Little Girl and I agree this is how it comes across to a degree but that was a misstep on casting department's part not the song writers- the children in the film did a great job (especially the boy who played Jack) but both of these roles are traditionally played by young adults- Jack is a young adult in the play and Red Riding Hood at least around 16 or so....this means Hello Little Girl is creepy yes and does have a rape overtone but it more about an adult male tempting a teenage girl to stray from what society says is acceptable than it is about any kind of sexual suggestiveness towards children.From towards of the end of the traditional Act 1, my issues with the film emerge. The speeding up of the time between the three nights and the resolution of that section mean speed magical pregnancy for the Baker and his Wife, and that lines like Cindrella's 'My father house was a prison and yours was a dream' ring strange because she doesn't actually live in the Prince's house for any time at all, as opposed to the about a year or more in the play...three babies (twins (more on them later) and the Baker's son) are born in that window.The original Act 2 of the play is to some extent gutted, and it is my favourite Act. Multiple songs are lost (the biggest loses to my mind are the reprise of Children Will Listen, the reprise of (my favourite song) Agony, and No More), Rapunzel's mental breakdown and death is lost, and the Witch loses much of her more sympathetic redemptive journey (due to the Rapunzel plot changes). In Act 2, Disney/the production team seem to not understand what to lose and what to keep and in parts they seem to be driven by an attempt keep the rating down (it is a PG in Australia which indicates it is child friendly when it should be an M)...after the misstep of child casting they seem to be on a race in the second act (the darker and at times racier act) to keep the moral standards high whilst also seeking to maintain the very popular song Moment in the Woods which implies bigamy or multiple lovers might be OK (the Baker's Wife wants 'A Baker for bread and a prince for...whatever' don't forget). It starts in late Act 1 with the time line shortening, during that window in the original Rapunzel is banished to the desert (swamp in the film) where she bears twins out of wedlock to her prince (before he hunts her down and she cures him of his blindness), something was going on in that tower that clearly was not deemed appropriate for the film. Then we have the mass reduction of infidelity...the film maintains the kiss between the Baker's Wife and Cinderella's Prince but in the play the staging (normally) implies that they have sex (the original production has them roll interlocked across the stage), and also the Princes reprise Agony and neither of them is singing about their wife (Cinderella's Prince sings about Sleeping Beauty and Rapunzel's about Snow White), as the Baker says the Princes are off wooing damsels and the song ends in the play with concession, 'Oh well, back to my wife'. This editing of the original makes the film seem half fulfilled in the end and that is very unfortunate for the strong performances and strong staging of some pieces (esp. Agony and The Steps of the Palace)...Disney has worked too hard to make a musical for adults into a marketable Disney film and whilst the final product is good, it is by no means great and considering the length of the film, they had time to include what they lost (the original musical is less than 3 hours) and to market it to adults and thereby to have a considerably better film. 6.5 stars from me!",Into the Woods
569,user-997-148463,Why people love and hate,10,17 January 2015,"I think the reason there is so much conflict about 'Into the Woods' is because this kind of movie requires a selective audience.For people who have seen the play before this film adaptation, most say that it is wonderful and almost an exact storyline, which is a great achievement for Rob Marshall and the cast and crew. I think to appreciate this film/play, a viewer has to be very good at seeing the deeper side of the film or someone who can understand how difficult and amazing these songs are, (though not always). The cast the the production crew did a fantastic job, proved by the total of 19 award nominations for this film. For those who didn't enjoy it as much, or at all, I believe that it is because they don't know the deeper storyline behind this tale (not to offend anyone). They might have not appreciated the work because it didn't make sense or the lyrics were 'dumb and cliché'. To those people, I respect your opinion but i just don't think you quite understand the whole concept of this film/play and I encourage you to find out. Please don't say this film 'sucks', 'was a waste' and 'you wish that it was never made', because although you don't like it, some people do and a lot of the creators put their heart and soul into this project, even if it wasn't satisfactory to you. I, myself after the movie thought that it wasn't nearly as great as i had hoped but as i was intrigued, i did some more research and discovered the true story and ideas, which for me revealed it's brilliance. It has one of the deepest and most powerful storyline's of a film as well as amazing soundtrack, so if you haven't already please try find the real meaning and if you still don't like it, then i respect your opinion of what i consider a masterpiece.",Into the Woods
570,ryanrafuse,People,10,31 January 2015,"I am a 13 year old movie/musical/Broadway lover and I went to the film on boxing day knowing what happens, and thought it was a very good adaption of the stage play! I have been very familiar with the stage production seeing a local production twice and the Broadway Original Production on Blu-Ray. The movie itself is fabulous for musical theater lovers. Stephen Sondheim, the composer, has made some of the most iconic musical's ever and this is one of them. With the twists and turns, the beautiful score and the tongue twisting lyrics like the witches ""rap"" Why, I think, people are giving the film bad reviews is partly Disney's fault (It's your fault) (If you have seen the movie you would have got that) and the people who just don't understand. On Disney's part, the first item (I think) is the poster. It's a beautiful poster but what it should have said was ""Walt Disney Productions Presents, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's Into the Woods"" almost making it that it is not a Disney original idea but an adaption. As most people don't now the play. Item 2, in the original production, Rapunzel dies, she gets squished by the giant. In the film, Rapunzel goes off with her prince. But when she dies in the play, the witch watches as she dies, the only thing that she loved. So the witch would have more motivation to get Jack and feed him to the giant and go into two of the best songs in the whole film (Lament and Last Midnight). Item 3, I think they could have found a way to have the narrator as a real person and the mysterious man because in the play when he dies, that is the turning point of the play where it gets darker and you say to yourself OK this is not Happily Ever After also, if they had made the movie PG-13 they could have been more so like play with the Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf and the Agony Reprise. But other than that, the movie is a classic, and if you have not seen the movie I would recommend watching the play on DVD than watch the movie. (Also, Meryl Streep is astonishing!)",Into the Woods

572,skylerp99,Everyone missed the point!!!!!!,10,12 February 2015,"Everyone missed the point of the movie! People have been saying it isn't appropriate for young children and I agree. Disney should have rated it PG-13, but that doesn't take away from the quality of the movie. This movie was a combination of different fairy tales such as Cinderella and Red Riding Hood. It combines them in a way that is very clever and innovative. It has a lot of musical numbers. A good 90% or so of the movie is SINGING, but it holds true to the original Broadway musical. This movie doesn't sugarcoat the fairy tales as much as usual. Most fairy tales were originally gruesome and they have been watered down over the course of many years. This showed some of the real world aspects of the fairy tales that were taken out without making it unsuitable for children. (ex. The baker cutting Red and Granny out of the Wolf's stomach off screen). Basically, this movie is a bundle of life lessons masked in a fairy tale. Overall, it shows that what you wish for isn't always the best in the end (i.e. the whole second act of the movie with the giant that everyone hated!!!!). It also shows avoiding certain temptations is best. For example, the Wolf in this movie, represents a pedophile targeting Red. It also emphasizes the importance of responsibility and commitment, when the Baker and his wife are finding the four items to have a baby. But it also shows that consequences come from actions, like when the with became ugly after losing her beans and the Baker's wife getting killed by the giant after cheating on her husband with Prince Charming. Lastly, it also shows an importance for perseverance and teamwork when they work together to kill the lady giant. In the end, this movie is great. The acting and singing is spot on with interweaving performances which keeps you interested. IT has so many life lessons that are important and necessary for growing children to know. So many parents want to shield their kids from the harshness of the world, but why do that? It just makes in worse in the long run when they are on their own. And, even better, it teaches these lessons while still being suitable for children. Children with thinks its fun and teenagers will start to realize the underlying messages as they mature. My eight year old sister loved it for the singing and plot. I liked it for the singing, plot, and messages that younger ones, such as my sister, wouldn't pick up on. My mom also liked it even though it wasn't what she expected. SO this movie is great and if you can't handle it, then maybe you should try the the Junior version; all the happy endings with no consequences whatsoever. It is what people have come to expect. Adult movies can have the harshness and kids movies can have the happy endings. But when you mix the together, everyone trashes them for being inappropriate. If you are truly prepared for a half-n-half, then I think you will love this movie too.",Into the Woods

This is the second worst movie I have ever seen in my life behind ""Napoleon Dynamite."" It seemed like a great idea for a Broadway musical, which I understand it once was, however the concept did not transfer well to film. Several of the songs made me extremely uncomfortable with all the children sitting in the theater, especially my own. I admit that I'm not a huge fan of musical films in general. I just have a hard time getting around the fact that people are having a conversation in song.

575,shannonfaith7,A Masterpiece,9,8 January 2015,"Does everyone understand that this movie is based off a MUSICAL? I think that's the first problem. The first complaint I saw about this movie is that they didn't know it was a movie musical and need to warn viewers of that in the ads. ...Do they not sing in the commercials? This isn't something Disney pulled out of no where. I thought that this movie was brilliant. Yes, it is a long musical, very long. We did this show when I was in high school (Baker's Wife right here) and it was 3 hours long. The movie was kind enough to cut things out so it wouldn't be a 3 hour movie. Another common complaint is that the characters were bland. I thought the characters were spot on with the musical. Little Red Riding Hood was a joy to watch and Jack (Gavroche!) was spewing with talent. The Baker and the Baker's Wife were adorable together. Though I was wary of Meryl Streep as the Witch I was impressed with her performance! The Princes' ""Agony"" was fantastic, I loved the Prince. The end was satisfying for me, staying true to the musical. I guess if you don't like the movie you won't like the musical.Spoilers (?) ahead:Now we do have a few negatives to point out. There is no sex between the Prince and the Baker's Wife. What a disappointment. At one point they talked about cutting that scene out completely so to have at least something there was good. The entire second act was pretty condensed and I had no problem with that. As the Baker's Wife dies early in the second act I honestly have no idea what happens through the rest of the second act but I thought it was done well! One other negative was that all of the Baker's solos were cut out, including ""No More"" where he mourns the loss of his wife and processes everything he is dealing with (I'm sure you wouldn't know this if you didn't know this was a musical).All in all, I was impressed with this show and thought it stayed absolutely true the the musical.",Into the Woods

I didn't either, I mean come on Cinderella set her birds on her stepsisters and they pecked their eyes out. It was clear to me that little red Riding Hood was being played in the same manner.

The wolf is a pervert and the baker has to cut the girl and grandma out of the wolfs stomach. The stepsisters are blinded by birds and so is the prince.

579,topcat1708,Won't rush to buy the DVD,2,24 January 2015,"Well, what have we here, a Disney movie. OK, I generally love them, especially Disney/Pixar collaborations. My 17 year old daughter dragged me along to see this, she reckoned I had seen a trailer, but I don't remember it, Jeez, I would have remembered THIS movie, but for all the wrong reasons.Anyhow, we go along and she suddenly says 'I have told you it's a musical, yeah?' I didn't remember that and anyway on the whole I don't have a problem with them, however, this is so much a musical that probably 99.5% of the film is sung, every ruddy line!After 20 mins in, I am thinking ha, not sure I'm gonna like this. I perked up a bit by the arrival of Johnny Depp, although this was short lived. I thought his lines seemed a bit peado-ish and I said this to my daughter after the film and I thought maybe it was just me, but she said it seemed a bit strange and reading through a lot of the reviews on here it wasn't just me, thank goodness. I thought at one point (the wedding) every one was going to live happily ever after, hurrah, I thought, finally, the end! Sadly, the giant then appeared and the movie carried laboriously on with the wretched singing and the stupid plot and the morals of right and wrong.With James Cordon as the baker with the strange outfit and being in the woods, all I could think of was Shrek (oh now there is a great movie, if you haven't seen any of them, you MUST).At one point the baker's wife suddenly sang out 'I must leave the woods' where upon I muttered oh, yes, please do!A couple of hours of my life wasted which I will never get back again, on the plus side, my daughter and I had bought a big bag of pick and mix which I scoffed throughout the movie to relieve the boredom.",Into the Woods
580,Booksnbroadway-165-267053,Great adaption!,10,2 January 2015,"I, being a HUGE fan of Steven Sondheim, and musicals in general, loved this movie. I had seen the original stage musical on netflix (they recorded it on stage and released it as a film) and I LOVE it. I was always less then enthusiastic about fairy tales because I didn't like the 'happy ever after' message. A few years ago, my mother suggested we watch Into the Woods, describing it as a fairy tale mash up that doesn't end in happy ever after. We saw it and I loved it! It made me appreciate fairy tales.I've read a lot of reviews where people are saying: ""I didn't know it was a musical!"" And ""Where's the happy ever after!"" Or ""It's so dark!"" A lot of those ones amuse me. The trailers made it perfectly clear that it was a musical, and the whole point of this show is that it DOESN'T end happily. Really, I thought it should have been PG13. It's not a show for kids. It has dark themes, the wolf is a pedophile, and there is adultery. It is nothing that cultured youths like my ten year old sister and I can't handle, but I've read a review where a poor eight year old girl was distraught at Prince Charming kissing the bakers wife. I was just thinking: poor kid! Such innocence! It's intended as an adult show, and the people who came in expecting 'disney magic' got the awesome, Sondheim musical. I was proud of Disney for not, well, Disneyafying it.It was different from the original musical. Songs and characters were cut, story lines were changed, lyrics were changed, lines were dropped, and although I really did not like the change, I understand. Like when a child wants a candy bar, but understands why his or her parents won't let him have it. Some things had to be cut. 'Agony' had the audience in stitches, and I was really hoping for the reprise. I did enjoy the two nods towards 'A Little Night Music,' another awesome Sondheim musical that I LOVE. You can hear the 'Last Waltz' when Cinderella arrived at the palace. I later caught Jack's harp playing 'You Must Meet My Wife.' I really and truly like the overall, 'there are no happy ending' message, but to the people who don't: That's not the only message. You can't forget that No One Is Alone, or It Takes Two, or any of the other great messages this show has to offer. The acting was great, and No One Is Alone melted my heart as usual.

581,kota-lewis-green,"Trsut me, it's worth the watch.",8,26 December 2014,"As a fan of musical theatre, Into the Woods was a movie I had to see the second I heard that was being made. My expectations, as a fan of Sondheim, were very high. And Disney did not disappoint. Not one role in this film was miscast. Corden and Blunt were the perfect people to play the Baker and his wife. Lilla Crawford and Daniel Huttlestone were risky casting choices by Rob Marshall, but they both paid off. Anna Kendrick brought the heart of Cinderella to life and his singing was perfect. But my top 3 performances of the film are Meryl Streep, Chris Pine, and Johnny Depp. Though his role is more of a cameo than anything, Depp takes his short amount of screen time and puts it to good use. He plays it up as the Wolf to a point where I was laughing, even though I knew I shouldn't have been. He stalks, sings, eats, and dies all within 5 minutes of screen time and does it perfectly. Meryl Streep can put a golden touch on any movie she's in and this role was perfect for her. She was funny, dramatic and goes to the limit as the Witch. Her Oscar nomination for this movie is almost guaranteed. Chris Pine is one of the best performers in the movie. He hams it up as the Prince and it leaves you laughing at his ""Agony"" with Billy Magnussen. The second he and Billy Magnussen started taking off their shirts in the middle of the song, myself and the rest of the people at the screening I was at were in stitches from the hilarity of the two princes. The dark themes that were present in the musical are still there and they work. I know that a lot of people are leaving Into the Woods out of the race for Best Picture, but now that it's out, I think it's safe to say that there is a pretty good chance. Everyone in the cast plays there role perfectly and not one person is miscast. Rob Marshall's direction, while not as perfect as his direction of ""Chicago"", is great for the film. James Lapine's screenplay keeps the dark and adult themes of the Broadway show while also slightly sanitizing it for Disney. The make-up work is so impressive, it's a wonder how it got snubbed for the Oscar. The set and costume design are also perfect. There was serious effort in bringing the classic characters and the woods to life. If this films doesn't get any Oscar nods, I will lose all faith in the Academy.Altogether, after seeing the disappointing remake of Annie, it's good to see a musical adaptation without a single miscast actor, a group of amazing actors who can sing, and set and costume designs that are absolutely perfect. Congrats to Disney for giving us a fairy tale that doesn't end with ""happily ever after"" and was a fantastic motion picture as well.

This sort of psychological punishment should only be inflicted on serial killers.HOWEVER, I want to share something that no one else mentioned, as far as I can see. What if ""The Woods"" is a simile**for life? All these characters enter into the woods naive in a way, even the witch, as to what will happen ""in the woods"", like a home schooled child entering into the mainstream of life. Like Telemachus, a figure in Greek mythology, the son of Odysseus and Penelope, and a central character in Homer's Odyssey. In the beginning of the book the boy enters into adulthood symbloically, as he sees the rosy red fingers of dawn, after a sleepless night of thought, so he becomes a man...I could explain this view, but that truly would be a spoiler, so if you think you can endure the musical aspect enter into the movie with this view in mind and you will be surprised to see ample evidence of what I'm saying...

Everyone is saying how dark it was, and yes it's dark because that's how the musical actually is!!! And some are even saying there is too much music. That's because it's a musical for goodness sakes.

It was done very well and I was very happy with the outcome! If you enjoy musicals, or simply just a good movie, this is a great choice.",Into the Woods
585,blackriverrt3,Deceptive trailer and 8 year old point of view included,1,28 December 2014,"My daughters opinion of this first........Daddy can we leave after about 40 minutes into it and her twisting and turning in the seat for 20 minutes at least. Daddy's opinion about 20 minutes into it, same thing. The trailer is clearly deceptive by leaving out the singing while the witch talks...........enough of it really, A movie with a few songs like Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty bang bang etc...and it's okay. The whole movie makes this not a movie! This is NOT Disney material and NOT worth wasting my time. If I had not been using free passes, I would have demanded my money back! I mean Johnny Depp showing off his skills for a singing pedophile? This is some sick stuff and for someone brainwashed into thinking this sort of thing is good. Bottom line, this movie was portrayed in the trailers to be for a child with the Disney branding and trailer, which left out the singing likely to garner more views. Big mistake Disney! I think folks will be a little more wary of your trickery now. There is a difference between a movie and a musical. Bad judgement call to deceive the consumer and not make this abundantly clear it was a musical. Someones job should be on the cutting block for this one without a doubt!",Into the Woods
586,rachaelm4404,Worst film I've seen this year.,1,28 December 2014,"This was the most stupid, sexually inappropriate (like, pedophilia, not South Park), unnecessarily long movie I have seen this year. It's like an awful mash up of Brothers Grimm and Les Miserables. The plot made no sense, the characters lacked depth, and the songs were completely unnecessary half of the time and added nothing to the movie. I think it was a great idea to make a musical that combined fairy tales, but the way they did it was plain awful. Meryl Streep was the only good part about this movie. I feel like Johnny Depp was only cast to be able to have his name on it, as he was in less than five minutes of the movie. The sheer stupidity portrayed by the actors (save Streep... most of the time...) made me want to hurl things at the screen and walk out of the theater. Then, there's a part where you're thinking ""Oh, good! This is the end!"" and you would be happy. But no, they added on an extra almost 45 minutes of worthless, plot-ruining story that added nothing to the movie. Do. Not. Go. See.",Into the Woods
587,filmfanfrog21,Creepy and disturbing. This is not a standard Disney movie.,1,29 December 2014,"I don't usually make it a point to review movies, but since this is one that you might take your little kids to see, I think it's important to know that this is not a standard Disney movie in the least. I've read that the original play was darker and strange (as most are), but Disney has always been known for changing things to be their own unique interpretations of old stories to have better moral lessons and happy endings that are almost always meant for young audiences, so I expected the same for this one. It was totally the opposite. All I managed to get out of it was ""woods are creepy"" and ""do whatever you want... It will all be okay in the end"".I'm a huge Disney fan and love musicals, but there were so many bad things in this movie. The creepily graphic wolf song about eating the little girl particularly made me very uncomfortable. Some people are even identifying it as having pedophilia references. After I did more research on it and read some of the comments from the producer in an interview, that is astoundingly horrible if it is true. Then there's also the stepmother cutting off part of her daughters' feet to fit the slipper, the lighthearted references to it maybe/sort of being ""okay"" to cheat on your spouse, and much, MUCH more. It was incredibly disappointing and disturbing, and not a kids movie at all.And on a side note - I thought it was really boring. I couldn't wait for it to be over not long after it started (and that's coming from a super Disney/musical fan). Actually, the whole theater full of people walked out like they felt the same way - no excited talk or applause after this one, just getting out of the theater as fast as they could. The scenery and costumes were neat, and I thought the cast did a good job, but there were tons of plot holes and pointless moments throughout. There was a lot of potential for Disney to make it good, but they fell way short.Overall, I have to say... maybe Disney should take their own advice on this one as given in one of the last songs of the film - ""Careful the things you say, children will listen"". I've always loved Disney, and while there have been things in the past that they have done that I didn't personally agree with or like, I felt like I could pretty much trust them to not produce such relatively pointless, morally questionable stories.... but this one makes me question that now. I'm really disappointed with Disney's decision to produce this movie and make it seem like another child's fairytale.",Into the Woods

I am not saying that the actors were awful, it was just the whole production, story and songs. I would have been better i they could have kept it short.

589,captkcrane,For one who saw the musical: Very good,10,2 January 2015,"I think people who have not seen the musical will not like this movie as much as those who have. I've been seeing that with reviews online at least. For one who has seen the musical, I thought it was spectacular! Great casting all around! I could see Meryl Streep winning an award for the witch. Johnny Depp kills it as the wolf, even with a smaller role. Chris Pine was a nice surprise! I didn't know he could sing. Though I will admit he did seem to be trying very hard in places. I still applaud the effort.If you haven't seen the musical, I suggest you go find it on youtube or wherever and watch that first. You will probably appreciate the movie more if you do. I give the movie high scores.",Into the Woods
590,uncreativeperson7,"If you're prepared, you'll love it",8,11 January 2015,"Many reviews I've seen have complained about the plot of the film, which is an entirely unfair argument. This is simply a production of a preexisting musical; you cannot legitimately criticize THIS production for the MUSICAL'S plot. If a local theater is putting on a musical, will you blame that theater if you don't like the musical? Of course not; they had no control over that. This is just another production done on a larger scale, and as such HONEST reviews can only judge it based on its interpretation of the show, rather than people's misguided expectations of what that show should be.If you're not familiar with ""Into the Woods,"" know this: it may be a Disney film, but this is a far cry from the classic animated fairy tales. Instead, it much more closely resembles the original Brothers Grimm tales. As such, it's a bit dark in spots, from Cinderella's stepsisters having parts of their feet sliced off, to Rapunzel's prince being blinded (both off camera). Furthermore, the second part of the movie (which is Act II in the original musical) deals with repercussions and consequences; what happens after ""happily ever after?"" As such, we see a much more fully developed story, though it may not be as happy-go-lucky as parents may expect. Again, this is a darker tale, and people can't complain because it's not all ""bippity boppity boo."" If it's too much, just don't take younger kids to the film.As a production of the musical, the film for the most part is brilliantly done. A fair portion of the original script has been cut, both to make it more family-friendly and also to reduce time. Some of these cuts include Rapunzel giving birth to twins (and then being killed by the giant), as well as some songs (""No More,"" for example, becomes a beautiful instrumental cue rather than a full song). None of these changes impact the story greatly, and in fact I found that many of these cuts made the film more enjoyable while still keeping with its darker integrity.Truly, the greatest part of the film is the performances. Meryl Streep (the Witch) and Emily Blunt (the Baker's Wife) of course act brilliantly, but I was also surprised at how good their voices are. I hadn't heard of James Corden before, but he also did a very good job in the role as the Baker. Anna Kendrick is a goddess as Cinderella, and in my opinion has the best voice of the bunch. Chris Pine is hilarious as the Prince, and Lilla Crawford (Red Riding Hood) and Daniel Huttlestone (Jack) both hold their own among the adults in terms of their acting and singing.The set was also a joy to see. The woods looked very realistic, and the lighting (through the tree branches) was absolutely beautiful. The CGI effects were good overall, although some things (the beanstalk at times, and the witch's thorns) did look a bit unfinished.Really, the only part where the film loses some points is with the Wolf. Johnny Depp did a good job with the seductive and devious nature of the character, but the modernist design surrounding him felt out of place. Everything else - from the costumes to the sets - was designed to give the production a realistic feel, which is good, as that could never be completely done on stage. For the wolf's costume however, Depp basically wears a gray suit with gloves and a mustache. When we see Red being swallowed by the Wolf later, the set is essentially a series of sheets literally being jostled by the cast. These design concepts could work in an entirely modernist production, but again, they felt misplaced here. Red probably should have just told her story, rather than showing it.Aside from the Wolf's designs, this is a brilliant production of an acclaimed musical, one that beautifully showcases the cast's incredible talent and visualizes this world in a new way. If you're looking to show it to young kids, you may want to pass, and if you're hoping for a standard fairly tale along the lines of ""Cinderella"" or even ""Frozen,"" prepared to be disappointed. If, however, you know what ""Into the Woods"" is - if you understand the the whole point of the show is a darker tale that also explores the consequences of our decisions - then you'll enjoy this wonderful film.",Into the Woods

Chris Pine's bit was admirable, as was Meryl Streep's. In fact, all of the actors were excellent, which reveals just how bad this film is. For me, it's the first musical that has ever inspired the thought, ""please, please, don't start singing"". The environment sets where good.

The musical, really more of an operetta at times, did not whitewash the tales as recent American versions have done. So parents, be prepared for the violence that comes with the original versions. This is 3/4 of the movie time and most conflict is resolved. Like the traditional tales, a happy ending is in sight. Act II: GO HOME. If you decide to stay, you will see new age ethics graying this tale. Mothers and families are destroyed and ""community"" is portrayed as the rightful primary caregiver. Relativism replaces morality, ""the village"" takes over after parents fall apart and/or are destroyed, confusion dominates over a logical and thoughtful understanding of the transpiring events.

Also a shout out to Christine Baranski as the wicked stepmother, a great role! Chirs Pine as prince charming is a very welcome surprise. He's very funny. Rob Marshall did an amazing directing job!

Firstly I was unaware that it was a musical, nevertheless I was hopeful that I would enjoy it. Within minutes I was confused, the storyline has no structure to it at all, it was thrown together with no real thought into it, it felt completely amateur. As for the rating of PG, considering the contents of this film I am glad I did not take my small children to see it, Johnny Depps scene with red riding hood was clearly a reference to pedophilia and actually make me squirm In my seat, and I am still deeply confused about Prince Charming practically having sex with the bakers wife while married to Cinderella....

This ""turn"" was not welcomed by me as I thought it just dragged the movie on and and completely altered the fun and bubbly mood of the movie.

Weak story line, no character development, absolutely nothing to get you involved with this film.

He runs into the bakers wife, who finally gets the baby that she has always longed for (one of the main so called story-lines), anyways they proceed to make out with each other. Why you may ask. Only the director knows. Because I sure don't. Don't get me wrong, the actors did good jobs, they just didn't have much to work with. It was absolutely one of the hardest films to sit through. The only reason I stuck it out was I kept waiting for it to get better. It had good actors, The previews looked great. I just couldn't believe this was 'it'. Unfortunately for me, it was 'it'.

I cannot remember one pleasant tune or melody. The initial ""song"" (if it might be called that) of ""Into the Woods"" sets the tone for the suffering to come. All 2 hours (feels like 5) of it. None of the characters are interesting, likable or engaging. The movie is rife with content inappropriate for its presumed target, children, but perhaps this point is secondary, as it is really appropriate for nobody. The plot is a twisted, convoluted mess. When the moviegoer realizes that the film is not, in fact, over, when all seems to have been set right, it is like having escaped from a sadistic torturer ... who returns to the auditorium, rearmed with an entirely new set of diabolical instruments.

605,mitchell_clayton,What a surprise and a delight.,10,23 April 2015,"I didn't see this at the cinema, I watched it at home. Which is to say, I payed for the $2 rental, for two hours of something I had no reason to trust, not $15+. When I say I didn't have a reason to trust the film, I mean that: 1. I (sincerely) don't like Merryl Streep's acting. 2. I thought that it would be an empty script that made for a gratuitous money-grab. 3. Star-power does not immediately make for an amazing film. However 1. This is the first film (since Lemony Sniket's: ASOUE) in which I enjoyed watching Ms. Streep on screen. 2. The script was clever, and well balanced between the dark, warning, original Brothers Grimm tales and modern storytelling vernacular, providing a sense of moral fiber that the original animated Disney films skipped over (for bright lights and happy endings), though never leaving a story unfulfilled and two dimensional. 3. The big (and little) names delivered heartfelt performances as well as both deliberate satire and tactful cliché in doses that (I believe) would amuse and frighten children for all the right reasons.In the end, other reviewers who naysay on this movie are doing it for one of three reasons 1 They have never read or understood the point of the original tales (seriously, go look at what happens in the end to the ""Little Mermaid"" in the original tale by Hans Christian Anderson). 2. They didn't believe 2 hours was the correct amount of time for this movie to run. 3. They struggled with the delivery of the story. Musical or acting. Theme or genre.Western fantasy and fairy-tale fables were created to scare children into ""keeping their head down"" and ""staying on the path"". They were created in a different world than the one we live in today. It was larger world, full of danger and mystery and terrible potential (for either good or evil). Today, story-telling is mostly used for escapism, and comedy is used to tell truths we find uncomfortable, distasteful or difficult to explain. In that sense (that not everyone can appreciate this film), I should probably have given it only 9/10. But, I have given it the highest rating, because it shocked me how much I enjoyed this film and how exactly TO-THE-POINT the writing was, and how unexpected the high quality of script and technical delivery was.",Into the Woods
606,jmechelle,not what I expected...,2,25 May 2015,"I don't normally research movies before I rent them so I guess my tip for anyone who hasn't seen it is to research what it's TRULY about not just the description given at redbox. The cast is what first caught my attention which is why I picked it out and probably why i was so disappointed. I like some musicals so I wasn't disappointed that it was a musical, I was disappointed with the music that was used. It was not typical of Disney by any means and frankly it just seemed like poorly written music in that half of the time it didn't rhyme and was dialogue that could have been spoken and gotten the point across better. I didn't feel like the music was catchy or kept my attention at all. I got extremely bored half way through and started reading reviews and that's when I discovered the movie is actually based off a play and kept the same music. So if you are into those types of musicals then this might be something you like. Overall I wasn't a huge fan of the movie. Maybe if I had researched it instead of picking it out of redbox on a whim I could have appreciated it more but for your average movie watcher this movie isn't for you.

607,faimusic,Judge for yourself - you'd be surprised,6,13 June 2015,"I'm kinda of surprised to see the only reviews that are receiving attention on this film are the negative ones. That doesn't seem fair to the film. I wouldn't say it's a great movie but it's certainly worth paying attention to. I feel like a lot of viewers either had never seen a play production of ""Into the Woods"" or expected the movie to be a perfect transcription of the play. I am a huge fan of the play - written originally in the 1980s, it was avant-garde and was very clever in the way it twists classic fairy tales before it was done everywhere. The music is reminiscent of a sing-song style that captures a childlike innocence. Stephen Sondheim is a musical and lyrical genius - he's widely acclaimed as one of the greatest lyricist to have ever lived. So any criticisms of the music astonish me as Into the Woods is among some of his best works. The clever lyrics and syncopation are wonderful. The play and film (at its heart) is about different fairy tale characters all trying to get their wish to come true. But once they all get their wish, they realize that what they got isn't what it's cracked up to be. So now they have to correct the mistakes of their past actions and discover what it is they truly want in order to get their happy ever afters. I am a huge fan of the play and was excited to see it adapted as a movie. I was also aware that this is one of the most difficult adaptations to possibly pull off. The play version constantly breaks the fourth wall and a lot of its humor comes from the interaction and connection is has with its audience. The film could never pull that off. And I knew that. For what we got, I thought it was okay. It won't live up to the play, but I think it's the best we could hope for. There are some stand out performances, such as Streep and Pines. The kid actors do surprisingly well and every does their part okay. I realized how complicated and confusing this story was to a new audience when watching this film. It doesn't help that we don't have intermissions in movies, which this film really needed. My biggest issue with this film is that it can't capture the changing moods of the play. The play has a lot of subtle changes in mood and atmosphere as it covers so many gray areas in these characters' lives while still maintaining a collective message of relying on those around you to get you through life's greater troubles and to not let the past prevent you from acting in the future. There are many messages, but those always come clear through in the play. The film does not do justice to this. It tries, but the subtle messages on parenting, abandonment, lust, greed, regret, obedience, trust... there's just too much to cram and the film has no idea on how to balance out these messages. What comes out is a cluttered mess, with the moods being... I don't even know.So I wouldn't say this is a good film. But I don't think it's horrible. The original play itself is genius. I disagree with opinions that say the play is horrible and badly written with bad music. It's won numerous awards for its music and script. I can completely understand if it's not your cup of tea though - it's a weird play that can be hard to get a grip on. The music may not be to your liking, but by no means does it make it bad music. If you're a fan of the musical, give the film a watch - it's worth checking out. And to be honest, it's probably the best we will get since it's a difficult adaptation to pull off. Personally, I'm glad to have seen. Don't let the bad review prevent you from checking this film out for yourself.",Into the Woods

My point: kudos to the director to keep Depp in the talk/sing role instead of breaking out in chorus. Kendrick, on the other hand, holy crap, that girl can sing! I loved the intertwined fairy tales and the costumes, scenes & sets were very well crafted and thought out....maybe a little more fantastical-Harry-Potterness would have helped those non-musical lovers become more engaged but all in all, a wonderful film/musical.It's very hard to take something from the stage and put it on big screen so I'm pleased to see the care in doing so...I mean, it's no Sound of Music or My Fair Lady but it sure kicks Mama Mia's ass :) ha ha",Into the Woods
609,daemonwhitey,Basically This Movie Is Way Better Than People Give It Credit For,10,13 September 2015,"To start off, I'm sure you've noticed the large amount of negative reviews and low ratings by other users. I read through many of them to notice that there is a similar undertone to all of them: either they didn't know that it was going to be a musical, the don't like that it wasn't 100% like the Broadway version, or the content was much less child appropriate than they were expecting. I found most of the accusations quite the fault of the viewers and much less the fault of the movie it's self. If you didn't know this was going to be a musical than it is your fault for not doing your research (I check out every movie on IMDb before going to see it as it only makes sense to know what your getting yourself into). I relate more to the viewers who were unhappy of how different the movie was from the play, but Disney was trying to make it more child appropriate and in fact did quite a bit. Which leads to the next point that this movie in fact does have very good and important messages if you are willing to dig deeper than what you saw on the surface. For example, Red learns not stray from the path she knows is right for something that seems appealing in the moment. The material point of this review is to say that too many people had predetermined what they thought the movie would be without looking into it first causing all the disappointment and bad reviews. I personally loved the movie and appreciated greatly how Disney mellowed it out for the sake of a younger audience. I am always listening to the wonderful soundtrack as well. One last thing: Disney did not write the story to this movie. If you are unsatisfied with the sudden change in tone half way through blame the storyline issues on James Lapine who did write the original story and transition from light to dark.",Into the Woods

Leaving a lot of questions and unfulfilled stories unless there is a second movie to explore this.1) The baker and Rapunzel were siblings separated at a very young age. In the movie they never had any interaction nor did they ever seem to want to find each other.2) After Charming and the baker's wife had it going in the woods, Cinderella breaks up with him and in the end agrees to stay with the baker. Did they fall in love? There was nothing that seemed like a love connection between the baker and Cinderella. But she did wish for a life somewhere ""in between""- referencing to the life she used to have (with the evil step-mom and sisters) and her dream life (as a princess). I'm so confused.3) Why the heck did the witch disappear into the ground...4) Mr. Wolf seemed to be more of a paedophile than an actual wolf unless of course the story refers to the original (17th century) version of the tale in which Mr. wolf was an actual person who raped LRRH.I would listen to the soundtrack!",Into the Woods

Camelot, West side Story, Sound of Music, Oklahoma, Paint your Wagon and so forth. This was just bad. My lady suggested that if the reviews mentioned that this was a Musical, perhaps no one would want to see it. Perhaps so.

Instead of a movie I got a poorly cast musical and not a very good one at that. It is disjointed and lacks any real depth. I must admit I don't really care for musicals and this one is certainly no exception. I wanted to walk out of the movie several times it was that bad. Only sat through it to make my wife happy. She ended up being disappointed in it as well so it is not just me. It throws around a bunch of fairy tale characters Willy nilly that are not really connected and shouldn't really be mixed into the same story. Nothing really links in the magical woods which should be the central theme of the movie with the poorly debacle. The few good scenes would be hard pressed to fill a 5 min commercial. The scene with Johnny Depp was so short that if you blinked you would have missed the whole thing and the wolf kind of reminded me of a pervert. I found myself disliking all of the characters. The main characters were selfish stealing left and right to get their own selfish desires fulfilled leaving destruction in their wake. I expected something much more original from Burton the director than a few reworked old tired fairy tales. I just didn't find anything to like about it at all. I just don't know what more there is to say about it. Don't waste your time or your money on this one.,Into the Woods

I've read that the story was hard to follow and there's complaints of the dark nature of the whole movie. I didn't do much digging but after reading a few articles I found that the original play was much darker than the movie was. I knew this going into it. I appreciated watching a musical that wasn't sunshine and rainbows at every turn. I've also read complaints about character development. There was definitely growth but what most people don't seem to realize is so many of the main characters died rather than simply ""disappeared"". But, to keep the movie from being too dark, the deaths were just moved off screen. I loved the songs, the acting was great, but above everything I loved how the story was told. Separate stories, becoming intertwined, or else affecting one another in some way and I love how you think everyone has their happily ever after when the giant comes and everything is turned around. Then comes betrayal, death and finally a true resolution of conflict. If you like the predictable, spoon feeding stories that tie up every loose end with a pretty bow, this movie is not for you. If you like complex, thought provoking, fantasy rooted in reality, dark and spontaneous, watch into the woods.",Into the Woods
623,BanditXander,Better On Stage,6,13 July 2018,"As a longtime fan of the original Broadway recording with Bernadette Peters, I was excited to see this as a large scale production. The sets are amazing and costuming is great and even the cast is well full of good talent. One of the things that makes a good musical great is all the work that goes into the harmonies and vocal work, especially in such a music heavy piece like this Sondheim creation. There is none of that here, voices are mostly electronically mixed and where there should be a swell of harmony, you find it seems 'lifeless' to put not to fine a point on it. The film is entertaining and fun even with the deviations to the original plot and themes, but lacks the emotional work and true emsemble work that really sets this particular musical experience apart from other stage and film pieces. See the original with Chip Zein, Bernadette, Joanna Gleeson etc. and then this version, and you may find yourself feeling the same way. Fun flick, better on stage with live talent.",Into the Woods

Here is a brief summary of my thoughtsActing = atrocious even by musical theatre standards. Meryl Streep, ugh....... I understand all the characters are supposed to be fleshed out versions of pretty one dimensional tropes. But holy lord...... It was enough to make me pity the actors in the film. Embarrassing and vapid portrayals lacking any sense of depth. This could very well be symptomatic of the poor choices made by the director. Story = obnoxiously heavy handed with the blended family, fairy tale of previous generations is over, lets take all of the fairy tales a step too far motif. Utter nonsense. Not one character compelled me to care for them. Not one big decision made by the characters made any kind of sense based on previous behavior or common sense. Case in point: a main character goes from focused and loyal, to seduced, to guilty, to ...... well I won't spoil it.... in a matter of 4 minutes. Maybe it was actually penned by a child. Enormous pacing problems. The film just wouldn't end. And talk about an anti-climactic end. The big ""baddie"" isn't even introduced until there is 40 minutes left in the film. and Oh, how those 40 minutes drag and drag and drag by. Music = the first 30 minutes of the film was enough to cause a brain tumor. All the characters are introduced in one song without any hook or melody, just talking to music. Throughout the score, no discernible melodies, memorable songs, nothing. Maybe the only film adaptation of a musical where I didn't leave the theater humming one of the tunes. Humor = Yikes... There were obvious moments where characters were supposed to be funny. Small asides or jokes or tongue in cheek quips. Completely fell flat. Not one person laughed in an almost full theater during the entirety of the film.I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea.A moment that really summed up the film, was upon leaving the theater, my girlfriend (Who absolutely adores musicals and especially film versions) looked at me and said. ""What the hell was that?""Rob Marshall, how far you have fallen. Maybe next time choose a musical with good source material instead of.......well........ whatever that was!",Into the Woods

And I am still not quite sure what I just watched. I do actually really enjoy musicals, so that aspect of it was fine with me. I liked the effects and setting and costumes and really everything about the appearance of the film. And even the idea of it. Although I haven't seen the original musical, so I guess I can't compare to that. But in terms of the story and writing itself, it's like the movie just couldn't decide exactly what it was trying to be. At one point, it's a mashup of different fairy tales, and for the most part, it does still present a more traditional and straightforward version of the stories. But then it tries to throw some twists in there, except those don't really go anywhere. At other points it's trying to parody the different fairy tales, except it doesn't do that consistently either. And with random humor thrown in, but not enough to actually make the movie a comedy. And then you have a bunch of characters acting completely contrary to their character without any real reason as to why. And I think the ending is supposed to be some sort of emotional life lesson, but I'm not sure it ever came across clearly enough to tell exactly what it is. I dunno. I think it probably did have potential. But it just felt like they tried to do a little bit of everything with it, and wound up not doing much of anything at all.",Into the Woods

It is rated PG for a reason, probably should have been rated PG 13. For one thing, the fairy tales within this story are more along the line of the true Grimm Fairy tales not the sanitized versions many of us grew up with. I personally think Disney should have used their TouchStone label instead of their Disney label as many families who do not know of this Broadway HIT will expect something entirely different just because it's Disney.That said, the screen adaptation of this play is excellent. It is well cast, the timing is great and the visual is awesome. So much more depth then you can get on stage.

Bewitching as a fairy tale, sharp as a cautionary tale, and catchy as a Sondheim score. So much of the cast seemed perfect for their role, and each voice a pleasant surprise in song. There was a little too much Tim Curry in Johnny Depp (with Mr. Curry as the incomparable of the two), but after this film I'm devoted to whatever role Emily Blunt chooses in the future. I also understand why my daughter likes Anna Kendrick so much. And while most expect perfection from Meryl Streep because she's Meryl Streep, I found her voice to be far stronger and more convincing than her turn in ""Mamma Mia!"" several years ago.""Into the Woods"" is like a love letter to the original source material.

However once it got to Johnny Depp's scene I started to feel a little uncomfortable. The scene is awkward and although children might not understand the underlying message, i certainly did and felt quite awkward about it. The film in general is almost too full of music and I found myself hoping another song would not begin. Agony was hilarious and I thought Emily Blunt did a really fantastic job. The other actors I would say were average. 2/3rds of the way through I found myself hoping the movie would just end. Several people walked out and many of the children in the audience were clearly bored. Which brings me to my final point: this movie should not be PG rated. It should have at least carried a PG12 rating. The movie has several very adult themes such as pedophilia, adultery, murder and rape which were not handled in a sensitive way. I understand that Grimm Brother fairy tales weren't exactly all fun and games but if Disney wished to make a movie like this they should have raised the viewing age. Overall it was too complicated, too long and too mature for a younger audience to view. I won't be watching this movie again and I would recommend to skip it.",Into the Woods

640,bilginpayze,"Never saw that coming, but it should have been R rated.",8,16 July 2015,"Spoilers ahead! Disney shocked me and apparently everyone else. The movie contains two parts. First part (75 minutes) looks like a classical Disney movie, which has some hints in it, that it won't be. Most of youtube reviewers insist that it should have ended there, like a classical childish boring Disney stuff. Well I'm glad that it did not. There comes the second part (40 minutes) which has a much darker tone. It's like Disney saying: ""Fairytales are told but here comes the reality."" We had the hints for this like the vicious Wolf showing Red riding hood ""Many things beautiful things!"" (not only some flowers) and Baker's wife (magnificient Emily Blunt) charmed by Charming Prince #1. This part people die a lot, for no reason to fill the plot. They just die because a giant stepped over them. Just like reality! People die in a car crush . Why? There is no behind reason to develop their family's character. They just die. Also in this part we see/imagine baker's wife adultery with prince charming. Why did she do that? It was Prince Charming, handsome, rich, in perfect shape, romantic, poetic. That's exactly what happens in real life with Prince or Princess Charmings. Talking about the princess, we see she already broke up with the Prince! Yes! Yes! Yes! By far the most stupid thing in the tales and Disney movies. is the Happily lived after forever bullshit!!! I cheered when I saw that scene, even it meant two lovers broke up (sorry for that). Also two major characters, baker's wife and the witch died for no reason. Maybe a reason (tar pond) for the witch but the wife. That' realistic. I also liked heroes blaming each other, that's also what is happening in the real world, between humans. But why this movie didn't get high notes and good critics? Because it is PG rated. It should been R rated with scenes like Wolf's child abuse, baker's wife's cheat, the villages and the castle's demolition, deaths of red riding hood's mom and grandma shown, the horror and desperation of all characters shown.

It doesn't help that they made the 2 princes into pure caricatures of the characters they represented.In all, this is an enjoyable romp which doesn't take itself too seriously... until it took itself too seriously. Then it got really annoying as you cringe before the characters break into another unnecessary song which could have been conveyed via regular dialogue.",Into the Woods

644,cito485,Amazing...with some little flaw,9,23 January 2015,First think I like to say is that the 12 pages of negative 1 star votes didn't do any research before seeing this movie and just saw it as a good trailer. Thats how you waste your money. The only people who this doesn't apply to is anyone who compares it to the play.Things to know before seeing this movie...1. This is a musical.....Based off the Broadway musical (that i never saw so not judging by the play but by the movie)2. The musical is not about the Disney tales you all know and love but about the grim brother's fairy tales that came before the Disney ones. They are all dark and sick.Now on to my review...Music: loved the music...Meryl Streep was amazing..loved her voice ever since Mamma Mia. Everyone was amazing in this film singing. I didn't care much for the singing voice of jack.Storyline: Loved the storyline. Seeing what the other characters would do to get their wish was a great idea as well as keeping to there grim tales. I do have to say they did cast red and jack very young when both of there story lines were a little sexual being that jack discovers his like for big women and red experiencing her first sexual encounter. I read that they were both played but older people in the musical. I would say that this movie isn't really for the younger kids. So do expect disappointment for kids under 15.Disney role: Disney did change a lot in the film from what i read that Cinderella was suppose to die but Disney didn't want to kill her major part. The play rules about 3 hours and Disney managed to do well while cutting out an hour of important things.Overview: I enjoyed this movie a lot and I know people are gonna continue to write hate reviews and you know what..You shouldn't let negative reviews let you from seeing a movie that you might actually like.,Into the Woods
645,Brummagem123,Excellent Film version of a PLAY,9,7 November 2015,"I've read some of the negative reviews of this film and have come to the conclusion that those who disliked the movie didn't quite grasp that it was originally a play. The film, unlike most movie adaptations of theatre, was very true to the play and was essentially a filmed version of the play, with little changes made. I had actually seen (and loved) the play the summer before this movie came out and was pleasantly surprised at how accurately it was portrayed here. Yes, the soundtrack and characters were cheesy, but delightfully so. Yes, Johnny Depp's character, the Wolf, was creepy and weird, as he was supposed to be. All of the actors all did wondrous jobs portraying the characters. The film (like the play) is musical, magical, funny and deep all at once. To those who love imaginative musical theatre, this one's for you. To those who don't, don't see the film - simple as that!

If musicals are your genre, then go. And, with all this money poured into the movie, why is it dark lighting? Two hours long and singing some forgettable songs.

The dark themes and existential question it confronts are great and things I typically relish. The common retort, I hear, is, ""what did you expect?...it's a 'dark' musical ""not meant for kids!"" Agreed! But mind you, not everybody has had the cultural privileges of being acquainted with every musical, and this is no small group. To this majority demographic, one must rely on the traditional avenues for judgement on the content of a film: 1) Trailer 2) Rating 3) The studio making the film.In this case, we have a trailer that does not expose the adult nature of the film; we have rating of PG, and under the banner of Disney. Furthermore, every preview of the film was targeted at children.*spoiler alert*So what about the film was so egregious in its inappropriateness to children? How about the themes of sexual lust? (Prince Charming seduces one of the main protagonists' wife, and she willingly obliged) Pedophilia? (Johnny Depps 'Fox' character has ""White Van no windows"" undertones) Meaningless death? (many are killed for no apparent reason other than to say the world is cruel.) Mind you, I am no prude, I can critically sit through Gaspar Noé Irreversible and not even flinch.

649,aeri_sardonic,Don't Put That Much Streep on the Posters if You Can't Deliver,6,13 January 2015,"The most publicized and successful posters for the movie have a strong focus on Meryl Streep's character. And while the character is a very vital to the tale, if you think this movie is about a witch granting wishes with twists instead of an indecisive princess played by Anna Kendrick, a sideplot mish-mash of other fairy tales, and quite a bit of James Corden acting flustered, then you are going to be sadly disappointed.Put simply, Into The Woods had less Meryl Streep than I needed.I can only give this movie a 6.5 / 10, proportional to the amount of Meryl Streep provided / amount of Meryl Streep expected. Any movie with Meryl Streep that has less than 10 units of Meryl Streep is not a Meryl Streep movie, but just a movie that coincidentally was lucky enough to be graced by Meryl Streep, and thus an inferior movie for not maximizing their potential. They were obviously aware of this potential given the content of most of the posters for the film. They cannot claim ignorance about the power of Streep, much like everyone in the movie claimed ignorance about the magical power of beans. Beans are normally not magical. Meryl Streep is.Frankly, I could have gone without the two fancy men flailing around in the river like lovestruck beavers if I had gotten just a minute more of Meryl's precious time.

It was partially my fault for not doing research into this movie ahead of time. Didn't realize it was a musical. And didn't realize the whole movie/musical is so messed up. Now self- doubt is starting to set in and I wonder if I'm just not artsy fartsy enough to appreciate this kind of masterpiece. Hmmmm. Nah. It was definitely a bad movie. At first I wanted to give it a negative score, like negative 10, but that does not seem to be an option. Then my spouse tried to get me to focus on the positives. I thought of some of my favorite things, like raindrops on roses, whiskers on kittens, bright copper kettles, warm woolen mittens, that type of stuff, and realized the actors and special effects people did a decent job.

To my disappointment, the movie didn't really turn out as I had hoped. The first half of the film was okay but this was only due to the fact that an intriguing story line was produced. The second half just fell to pieces. The effort that was put in to the writing declined suddenly which left maximum disappointment with the film just suddenly coming to a pointless end.The acting was standard with the only star standing out from the crowd being Meryl Streep but even then it was not great. Overall, the film was basically a disappointment in my eyes. I guess it was worth a watch but, in my opinion, I will probably never watch this film again.",Into the Woods
653,eddieboyfshn,The best behavior analysis,10,10 May 2015,"First of all I came there to read other opinions of how great this film is. I was very disappointed to find out that most of you did not enjoy it. I knew nothing about the storyline or the original musical show until the film ended and I stayed a few more minutes to see who the director and the writer were.About the film: I really enjoyed it, I think is one of the best movies ever made and it will become one of my favorites. But, after reading some reviews here, I decided to not recommend it to all the people, but only to them who are able to see beyond the screen and enter the mind of the characters.This film is about the life, literally. Almost all the most important aspects of everyday life are included in this story, and the writer gives them an explanation that inly a psychologist could give.All the old fairy tales (my grand mother did not knew the Grim Brothers, yet she had told me all these stories, in a different version of course, long before I read them on the books. As I was saying, all those tales are not casual stories, but actually they have a far deep meaning and they are not for he kids, they are for the adults, how to teach their kids.The references to pedophilia, young age sexual desires, middle age sexual desires, etc.. are actual, but they are not a deviance of the authors, but a warning, a lesson to us, and a way for us to understand.I give to it 10 stars, even I found it maybe to long, but worth the time.I myself like to write and I was thinking to rewrite some of those old stories, with a different point of view, but now I don't think I need to do it anymore, I just can return and watch this movie again.",Into the Woods
654,Morphumax27,"An entertaining musical that isn't for everyone, but is fun nonetheless",7,20 September 2015,"++SPOILERS AHEAD++I'll say this now – this film isn't for everyone. It depicts a style of fairy-tale closer to The Brothers Grimm, in parts, than the normal family fantasy sold by Disney. This becomes clear just over half way through the film, so the transition can be quite jarring for some, but ultimately it serves the film well. 'Into The Woods' is a film adaptation of a Sondheim stage musical, so naturally some of the spirit will be lost in translation, but it stands up on its own. The story begins with a hectic, interwoven musical performance which introduces each character succinctly and without really missing anything, and then sees each of them venture into the woods as part of their 'wish'. All of the characters face obstacles and encounter other characters in the woods (including Johnny Depp as a very dapper Wolf for all of 7 or 8 minutes). They see their wishes come true, but unlike most other fantasy films of this sort the consequences become very dark and a happy ending seems too much to hope for. The cast is mostly well-assembled; James Corden and Emily Blunt (The Baker and his Wife) who have had some singing experience, are surprisingly competent singers and hold their own well against other musical heavy-hitters like Anna Kendrick (Cinderella), Tracy Ullman (Jack's Mother), Christine Baranski (Cinderella's Stepmother) and Meryl Streep (The Witch), who quite rightly owns every scene she's in. The wild cards of the film are the younger actors Lilla Crawford (Riding Hood) and Daniel Huttlestone (Jack), who despite their age act well enough for this - at times hammy - production and have the vocals to back it up. Some of the musical numbers fall flat but the good ones are great.Because of the ensemble it can be difficult to focus on one character to follow or like, but this won't necessarily hurt the viewing experience. Special mentions to Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen (Prince Charming and Rapunzel's Prince, respectively) for a very humorous rendition of 'Agony' that sees the brothers trying to one-up each other repeatedly. On the whole I found 'Into the Wood's thoroughly enjoyable. I'm not the biggest fan of musicals or musical films but I appreciated this one; solid acting, mostly decent songs and a charming, whimsical plot which takes a sinister turn when the actions of the main characters come back to haunt them. Meryl Streep is the highlight of this film, and her singing 'The Last Midnight' offers a dramatic and chilling perspective from the 'villain' point of view.I'd recommend the film, just not to everyone.",Into the Woods
655,lanipator123,"This movie is fantastic, SO MUCH NEGATIVITY FOR NO REASON",6,25 January 2015,"This film was so close to masterpiece level, so close. It is superb not only as a musical, but also as a piece of film. Many people critique the movie for having too many songs with no flow, but the thing is this film CANNOT be viewed as a regular musical. If you go into this film and treat it like a run of the mill musical, you will be disappointed because in reality it is something greater. The entire film is like one big musical number that keeps changing pace and tone to fit the story. Not only is this the most interesting way to incorporate music into a films story, but it was thoroughly enjoyable. The cast can sing very well, and the songs made the story and dialogue far more interesting to watch. I hate musicals, but quite honestly I found myself more bored with the regular dialogue than with the singing. Mostly in a musical I'll be begging for them to just stop singing and talk like normal, in this film however it was quite the opposite. The cast was phenomenal, each portraying their characters true and well. It is good to note however that this film follows the fairy tales as seen in their ORIGINAL format, not the Disney re-tellings of them. So this does include all the gruesome and less child friendly bits of the stories which may scare younger kids, but to the older viewers this should very much be a good thing because the original bits cut out of the Disney re-tellings are gruesomely awesome. This film very much is not your typical family Disney film and should NOT be taken as such. This film deals with issues of infertility, being unfaithful, death and grief, and other very mature matters. And all the better. It's a mature film with the child like exterior of fairy tales and musical numbers, very much making this a more unconventional family film. This movie does not deserve all the negativity it's been receiving by other users, this film is absolutely fantastic and definitely worth a watch.",Into the Woods

When journeying into the woods, they are confronted with giants, princes, wolves, challenges and disappointment. The dialog/cadence of the libretto is quick and intelligent.

As for the people who are complaining about the pedophile undertones, um, yes, that is the point. In the original Broadway musical the wolf costume included an anatomically correct penis, just waving around on stage. The story of red riding hood is a metaphor to warn children about predators. All of the terrible things that happen to these characters are actually true to the plots of the original fairy tales. However, this was a terrible adaptation. I expected new actors to make the songs their own and have slightly different inflection, etc. The meaning of most songs was just totally lost. For example, the Baker and his wife in ""It Takes Two"": they have no chemistry. This is supposed to be a very deep and moving song about a couple evolving to a cooperative partnership, instead they are doing somersaults and just singing at each other. The whole moral of the story is lost as they cut out critical parts of the plot. Also, the set reminded me of the swamp in the Princess Bride.

The worst thing about this awful film is just when you think it is coming to an end and your agony will be taken away it continues for another 30 minutes. Why did this film get made? Really really really awful film. My wife who I went with loves musicals but also found this film excruciatingly bad.

663,joannertiz,Don't complain about this being a musical!!!,8,28 December 2014,"It really makes me angry when people complain about a movie being a MUSICAL after they go see it. Look it up before you pay money to see it!!! It's a popular Broadway production! It's honestly your fault if you go pay money for it without even finding out what it is about and whether it's appropriate for children. That's on you. It's not the film preview's job to tell you if your 6 year old can see it; they're trying to sell a movie. If I worked at that theater that you were ""demanding a refund"" from, I would tell you where to stick your ticket.Now that we've established that, let me say a few words about the film. Only people who have seen the actual Broadway production should be reviewing this film. If you have a problem with the music, take it up with Stephen Sondheim because it comes from the musical as I have said before. A film adaptation is obviously not going to compare to a live production so get over that, there is just not enough time and it's a different format. But, as far as adaptations go, they did change quite a bit and I'll attribute that to Disney being behind this film and trying to market it to that audience. Believe it or not they had to cut a lot to make it more family friendly and people are still complaining about it. The original production is obviously not owned by Disney and is much darker therefore I was surprised that Disney even wanted to make this film and market it to their brainwashed Frozen-loving happily ever after followers.So if you are thinking about watching this film, get this in your head: This is not a happy fairytale and not a family-centric film. It's always been for adults. It's ironic and has dark humor in it and that's what it's known for (and why I love it), but at the end of the day there's a beautiful message in it that no life is perfect like the fairy tales we're used to. The music is clever and beautiful, the acting is very well done (Emily Blunt was my favorite), there's humor, and it's a tribute to the much darker Grimm Brothers version of these fairy tales and of course the musical.

And I am really surprised that not everyone gets the meaning of it. Well, I can agree that it shouldn't be PG-rated. But for adults, if you actually see what is portrayed in the songs , instead of only trying to get a tune in your head you will see it talks about major subjects like - the duality of good/evil; the fact that no one is satisfied with what they have. Like Cinderella - she has her dream fulfilled and even so it's not enough for her. These characters are humans that make mistakes , that learn lessons but make mistakes again...And some things are actually more accurate than you think - in the original story of Rapunzel the Prince loses his sight as well... The true meaning of Little Red Ridinghood is actually sexual... The Stepmother also cuts the feet of the sisters in the original story for them to fit in the shoe...So please - try to think about what you saw. I think there are too many mainstream plots in the cinema and i don't like to be fed with Hollywood-fastfood kind of fairy tales like ""Maleficient""It's a 10/10 because the original play is wonderful, the cast is wonderful portraying it, because i love musicals and they don't have to have Pop-tunes for everyone to sing-along.",Into the Woods

It seems unless something explodes, or someone flashes their breasts, no one wants to see it, let alone a movie that reaches for psychological heights and closeted skeletons that no ""entertain me"" American wants to deal with at the movies. This film is simply about wishes that come true, and that wishes don't always turn out to be what we thought they would be...what they could be. The fact that the movie is unclear to most evidences that they missed even the meaning of the title. Sondhiem takes us all into the woods but graciously does not pull every branch back or clearly mark the path to walk, as a modern parable, leaving the interpretation to his audience.

Nonetheless, the prince didn't seem right, even in the beginning, which threw off the movie quite a bit(great actor/ beautiful voice/not a the right part for him).This was not a scary movie, just a very corny musical based on fairy tales.",Into the Woods
671,skhvball,A waste of talent,1,27 December 2014,"OMG - this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First, despite an excellent cast including the amazing Meryl Streep, the characters were wholly unlikable. Even in movies with despicable characters, someone is likable. Hannibal Lector is more endearing than the characters in this offering. Secondly, you may be surprised to learn that this was a musical; a fact mysteriously missing from the array of TV promos for the film. That said, I do enjoy some musicals and own DVD's of West Side Story and Les Mis. The music in this film was neither inspirational nor emotionally moving despite the talented performers. Lastly, the plot meandered aimlessly to the point where a swift demise of the entire cast would have been preferable to the the protracted ending. Buyer beware - do not see this movie.",Into the Woods

The score by Peter Frampton is particularly enjoyable as it is straight off his album ""Frampton comes alive!""Without Jerry Dipp's lackluster, mind boggling horrid performance this abhorrent, offensive, ghastly bit of tripe could easily be considered amongst the greats such as 'Goodfellas', 'The Godfather' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean 4'.However, Dipp's performance did happen.Polar opposite to Dipp was the beautiful and talented Meryl Streeps who gave a state of the art performance that was bust personified. Her Tour de Force display elevates this sludge from 'abhorrent' to merely 'vomit-inducing'.When Virgo Mortensen pulled out of the role of the shy odd fox in favour of ""A History of Violence"" (2005) the project was doomed. But, as the captain she is, Merlyn Streep went down with the ship tragically sunk by Gerry Dipp's blitheringly bad performance.Amongst the other more minor roles, piercing songstress Emily Blunt appeared with a performance that would do her acting coach Helen Keller proud.More strange casting choices also plagued this cesspool of a film, with Chris Pratt circa 2013 being cast as the Jolly Candlestick Maker whilst Present day Chris Pratt also played the handsome and well-endowed Prince.Unfortunately Pratt's on screen chemistry with himself fell wildly short of the mark.I'd love to call Jerry Dipp a 'has-been' but the fact of the matter is that he never was!! Here's a little rule of thumb for all you budding young Mark Ruffalos out there: DO NOT PUT JEREMY DIPP IN YOUR MOVING PICTURE!!!!The grotesque presence of Dipp lingered long after his one misguided scene catastrophically imploded.Vehemently Unlikeable tripe.Abhorrent.5 STARS – WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMENDDisclaimer: Harry and Lew would like it to be made known that they usually write positive reviews (See 'Dennis Hopper shines a light in his new TV series 'The Shining""').

673,sagfalcons501,Loved the movie,9,30 December 2014,"I love the movie. I have seen the stage production and loved it. It was well made for jumping from stage. All the actors were well casted. Meryl Streep, Anna Kendrick, James Corden, and Emily Blunt were all great in the movie. There I one thing that I missed from the musical that was not in the movie was the ""No More "" song. That song is a really great song it helps the baker change his thoughts at being a father. I heard the tune where he was alone in the woods after he left his child with Cinderella. That song would have brought James Corden's character to where the point where it is in the musical. Emily and Meryl had their big songs. ""No more"" was his. I will buy this movie when it comes out and watch it over and over again!!!!!!",Into the Woods
674,sdbg,Way too dark for a Disney movie. Children won't enjoy it and parents/adults will feel highly disappointing,5,15 July 2015,"Before starting with my review I want to mention that I didn't know that this movie was based on a play until I read it on WikiPedia, so right here I'm just sticking to what the movie experience was to me.First of all, I have to say that I really liked to see characters and stories from tales that had never made it into a Disney movie before like ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", ""Little Red Riding Hood"" while I also enjoyed the Grimm brothers' original storytelling of Cinderella and Rapunzel being used. And the idea of mixing all those stories in one single universe was fantastic. However, as the movie went on it just didn't pay off.I do like musicals, Disney or not, and Meryl did an amazing job in Mamma Mia, so I was very excited about this. However, I just think there were TOO many songs. The trailers do not actually tell you the whole thing is a musical and the characters barely speak throughout the movie. Also, the pace of the movie is pretty fast, I would say (with all the characters' stories taking place simultaneously), which is really enjoyable but the singing sometimes makes the course of the story stop, which may be a little bit frustrating and the movie starts feeling too long during the last hour. I have no critics towards the composition, the lyrics or the performances, everyone did a great job regarding that point.But my major critic regards some really awful character development, and this is when the spoilers being so if you haven't watched it yet, just skip this whole paragraph. The baker and his wife, for example, seem to have a very happy life at the beginning but then she meets with the prince a couple times and starts feeling things for him. This seemed so forced to me, especially because all this subplot takes place just after seeing the lovely couple struggling during more than an hour to break the Witch's course and have a baby, with her constantly telling her husband that they must do it together. So it was very frustrating too see her forget about her baby and husband in a second and surrender to the Prince's charm. Also, the Prince seems to be in love with Cinderella but then we discover that he's just an asshole who wants to hook up with every available woman in the kingdom. So there you have the two magic couple who ran most of the movie you were watching, destroyed within seconds. And I don't even want to mention the stupid deaths that come afterwards. Inexplicably, you just see the characters disappear from one scene to another, and some silly dialogue mentions that they died follows. So, paraphrasing my last paragraph in case you didn't want my review to screw up your whole movie experience, I will just say that any the stories that make you fall in love with make it to a happy ending. But this is not wrong because Disney is not supposed to be this, but before you can't help but feel frustrated. Sometimes characters are killed off (The Lion King, Bambi) for the sake of the story and sometimes some others just leave, and its fine because the departure is surrounded by a well-developed script that doesn't make you feel insanely frustrated at the end, but this is not the case. Not at all. I would strongly advise you to stop watching this movie after Cinderella gets married, for that is the ending you would want for every character you get to care about. Then it just gets too dark, unconvincing, silly, and also the movie gets too long because of that. But the worst part is that you really get to like the movie so you will want to get to the end but, trust me, it's just not worth it.PS: If you got to read this entirely, thanks, I didn't thought it would be that long. Greetings ;)",Into the Woods

You just find yourself lost trying to make sense of it but it doesn't.. Why do yo make someone sing a song about cheating, excitement and so on and then kill her? What was the use of that? Why red hood is saved, if she is going to live without her grandmother? Whole Cindrella story felt unreasonable...I won't say anything about acting and performances.

This was like some sort of jumble of everyone's ideas all put into one. It was in fact like two scripts one after the other. It made no sense what so ever, with many of the characters seemingly playing no role in the actual outcome of the story?! There are too many sidelines going on that don't materialise to anything, and it sorts of makes it pointless to have watched it in the first place. Why isn't the main character the main character throughout? There is a total shift half way through and suddenly, we are now focused on a different story all together?!",Into the Woods
677,tammyjrizzo,Thoroughly enjoyable ... IF you know what you're going in to see.,9,25 January 2015,"I saw this movie just yesterday, with my mother and sister. We all enjoyed it a great deal. Of course, we all were very familiar with the play, as we have the DVD with Bernadette Peters as The Witch, and have seen it often, and we've seen it more than once at local community theaters or local college theaters. We were eager to see the film adaptation and see how it was changed to fit on the big screen.For one thing, we were curious how they would cut the nearly three-hours running time of the play (not counting intermission) and still fit everything into only two hours on screen. This is a valid question, because the play INTO THE WOODS has music and song through almost every single minute. It's something like two bars short of an opera, with one song blending into the next, and then the next, and nary a break in between. The question of what to cut, therefore, is vital. As it turns out, what they cut, they cut well - the missing songs weren't really missed, and any missing information that the story needed was added into dialog. And whadayakno, the story still flowed well, the music still flowed well, and the plot still flowed, as well.As for the acting, Meryl Streep was fantastic as The Witch, doing as wonderful a job with the role as Ms. Peters did on Broadway. Chris Pine, who played Cinderella's Prince, was suitably charming in the role, while also giving his character a hint of creepy and shallow on the side. James Corden was just great as The Baker, with a good blend of humor and pathos. And Daniel Huttlestone, the boy who played Jack, was a real eye-opener! You want to watch him as his career progresses.In the play, the character of The Narrator is central to the whole story; he's the only one who knows what's supposed to happen, after all. There was no Narrator in the movie, and, again, we wondered how that was going to work. As it turns out, it worked pretty well. The Narrator is only missed by people who knew he was integral to the play; the movie is adapted to not need him.The music is, of course, pure Sondheim, with minor chords, artful disharmony, overlapping lyrics, and a meter that is occasionally a little bit bizarre. It's not pop music that you can hum along with, tap your toes, and dance to in your seat; that doesn't mean it's not good music, though. Good music does more than just stick to you; good music gets in your head and pries it open to new experiences, new ideas, new feelings, and Sondheim's music and lyrics do just that.I've read other reviews of this movie, and from what I've read, most of the people who loved the movie were already familiar with the play, and most of the people who disliked the movie had no experience with the play. Many of them had not done any homework before going to see the movie. They went in expecting a Disney Musical, with a Disney Ending, and felt terribly upset and cheated by what they actually saw. This movie, while made by Disney, is definitely NOT a ""Disney Movie""; it is, however, a brilliant adaptation of a Sondheim masterpiece.",Into the Woods
678,justicelemme,into the woods? i would rather get the hell out of the woods,1,1 March 2015,"OK I'm a huge huge HUGE movie fan and it is super rare for me to not like movies but this movie is just a disaster. First off its PG? really Disney? You show the evil stepmother cutting off a heel off one of her daughters and cutting off a big toe off the other all for a stupid shoe sure nothing was shown but implying it was just as gross and weird. Second off it is as boring as watching paint dry maybe a little more boring than that. I would rather listen to the annoying kids behind me comments on the movie than the movie itself. The movie is so boring in fact that I would rather read war and peace than watch it. It was so bad i liked the side story of Rapunzel more at least that didn't kill off pretty much the whole cast talk about a big cop down then there's the part where I thought it was the end when I heard happily ever... I was so excited I almost got off my seat until that so called freaking ""earthquake"" happened and made it drag on for 40 more minutes to an hour I mean I'm still surprised I was able to sit through it. The music annoyed me and so did the characters to I know you're going into the freaking woods stop repeating it. Its sad I like Noah a little more because at least they had a semihappy ending instead of making Prince charming a condescending non loyal prick and killing off half of main characters. I really expected more especially from johnny depp they just wasted his talent in this by making him look cartoonish and all that.

The songs were boring and irrelevant, the storyline all over the place and was just simply uninteresting. How disappointing. Finally, when I thought (hoped) the movie was actually over, another 50 minutes of utter crap was added on. I actually would have left but I was with friends and didn't want to be rude.

680,lemondrizzle123,A disappointment for Disney,2,21 January 2015,"As a massive Disney fan I had pretty high expectations for Into The Woods, with such a broad cast and an interesting spin on the classic fairy tale era (judging by the trailers and featurettes) however I left the cinema disappointed because of how repetitive and bland the film was. Unlike a surprising amount of people, yes I knew that it was a musical but the film felt more like one long, boring musical number rather than memorable songs to define each scene. The well-known characters turned out to be pretty dull which wasn't the cast's fault - more the basic script, and although the film was visually impressive it didn't have an interesting enough plot to justify a film of that length. Wish I could say that it was better but overall it dragged and I wouldn't go and see it again - higher hopes for the new Cinderella film being released later this year.",Into the Woods
681,Sicilienne,Fantastic representation of the original musical,8,10 January 2015,"As someone who's played in the pit orchestra of a university production of this, and as a consequence know the music for Into the Woods like the back of my hand, this review will likely be a bit music-centred, but for a good reason: it thoroughly deserves the praise. Disney's version was absolutely everything I wanted, and nothing I expected. I didn't think Disney likely to be at all faithful to what I (like many other original Broadway fans) consider to be an exceptional stage musical. I didn't expect the music to be up to scratch, or anywhere near the original in its 'sound world'. I expected them to have done something wrong with it, maybe changed the story around, left out important musical motifs... anything. But working with original composer Stephen Sondheim and writer James Lapine themselves has no doubt been the driving force behind what is, in my opinion, a triumph of an adaptation from Disney. The plot of Lapine's book is adhered to like glue in his screenplay, with only the tiniest of deviations which are overall inconsequential. The music is flawlessly re-orchestrated for a film orchestra by its original composer, and it shows, with extra incidental music composed in exactly the same vein as its source material. It must have been an absolute dream for Sondheim, being able to re-write his musical for a production of this scale: his orchestrations scale up wonderfully, proving the quality of the original score. Words cannot describe how well the music has been treated, offering a beautifully fresh version of a beloved musical from the composer himself. As a musician I was smiling throughout. All of this supports unexpectedly fantastic casting and acting against an authentic, CGI-lacking backdrop. Into the Woods will never please everyone: and, though I wasn't around when the original was on stage, I would guess that that has always been the case. It's meant to be dark and unsettling, with each character slightly 'off' from the usual stereotype, and a very long way from your average Disney story, where everything is glossy and everyone is happy in the end. That is the point of Into the Woods: it's critiquing the idea of happy endings, or more accurately, living without consequence. For fans of the stage show, or those who want something a little different from their cinema experience, it is perfect. My advice is give it a chance, and see if you like it. You might not, but it's most definitely worth that chance.",Into the Woods
682,jxleung,NOT a film Disney should have produced...,4,7 January 2015,"Disney advertised this film as a film for families with young kids and this film was anything but for young kids...the theater was filled with kids ranging from the ages 3 to 9. Kids these ages have only heard the ""Disney: versions of these classic Grimm Brother classic tales. Therefore what was Disney doing with a film that differed so much from their own stories? I can assume many kids were probably shocked to see Cinderella's step sisters cut off parts of their toe to fit the slipper and when Cinderella's prince somewhat cheats on Cinderella with the Baker's wife and she ends up dumping him. That just gives Disney's Prince Charming a bad name...this wasn't like Snow White & The Huntsman because that was not a Disney film but this was...so what is Disney trying to say??? The whole film and original play tries to show you that ""life is not a fairytale"" but because of Disney's involvement and their need for this to be a ""family friendly"" film, when in reality this should've been intended for adults, many original plot elements were either changed or unfocused on. Examples would be: Jack's mother is basically clubbed to death in the play but in the movie she's accidentally pushed and hits her head on a log. Also when the Baker's wife dies, all we see is a hand slip from the branch and a slight scream...you couldn't be sure if she fell off a cliff or just slipped because Disney wanted to make sure they got their PG rating. Also in the play the Baker's Wife and Price Charming don't just kiss...they actually commit adultery. Lastly Disney completely took out the part (for good reason) when Rapunzel's Prince and Prince Charming start lusting over Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. I prefer the Disney versions but if they were to make a movie out of this play they should've made it at least a PG-13 movie because it shies away from important plot elements that help enforce the moral of the story. I still don't understand why Disney would think this is a film for families...it just ruins the reputation that they've built for their own characters. So since this is a Disney endorsed film can I ask Prince Charming about this next time I see him at Disneyland?",Into the Woods
683,hanson_chris_D,Broadway vs Theatrical version,8,13 May 2015,"To start off, I grew up watching the original Broadway version, along with preforming Into the Woods off Broadway. This musical is not, never has been and never will be meant for children. Please do not expect to go into this review/movie thinking this is all fairy tales, because it's not. If you read the true Grimm Fairy tales they are much less 'happily ever after'. Into The Woods (both Broadway and Theatrical) shows this quite vividly. Disney did very well by maintaining the soul of this musical, and not making it their own. I applaud them for this.I have heard many people talk about the beginning being done well, yet the ending not so much. Please keep in mind that the Broadway version has an intermission after the wedding. This Does not solve the issue that it confuses most people, but it does through a clear cut line in there which makes things easier to follow. On the side of the vocals, I was very happy with the songs. They followed the same design as those from the Broadway version. I know some people would like to have seen Disney do their own twist; but i am very happy they kept it as close to the original. This also stands true for the script itself. There are a few Disney ad libs, but they work with the movie. No complaints. The cast choice I thought was done very well. I am not one for 'all star casts' in well founded musicals (Les Miserable being a prime example) but the casting for this movie was done very well.I do however, disapprove of the removal of the old man/bakers father. Granted, he was purely a supporting character, he was still comedic relief. Now i need to make a disclaimer here before I go on. I am in no way condoning pedophilia, rape, or murder. That being said I will continue. This movie toned down those factors from the Broadway version. On stage, the world costume is Anatomically correct. ie, it has a giant penis uncovered and open to the world. All in all, the movie is done very well. It follows the Broadway version better than I thought it would. If you are looking for a dark/twisted musical which catchy melody's, i highly recommend this movie.",Into the Woods
684,brittanykeller1985,Into the Mediocrity..,1,9 January 2015,"This movie was a joke pretty much from the first half hour. I can break down where it all went wrong in a few reasons: lack of character development as well as motives, songs that used the same four or so notes as well as did nothing to progress the movie, creepy sexual and adult innuendos in a supposed children's movie, and just plain bad acting.The main characters in this movie were shallow, one dimensional, and just boring. The baker was a goof who ran away from his one and only child, his wife was a promiscuous bimbo in the end who randomly stepped off a cliff and, not surprisingly, no one cared. Little Red Riding Hood was the most obnoxious little brat that I kept hoping would trip over an uplifted tree root and break her neck. Johnny Depp as the Wolf was, in a word, horrifying. In fact, he deserves his own paragraph here.From the moment he stepped out from behind a tree clad in what looked like parts of his Jack Sparrow costume with fur glued to them and a pedophile mustache I was disturbed. Then it only got worse.. he preceded to dance provocatively around the 12 or so year old girl portraying Red Riding Hood, even throwing his leg up in her face and tearing his jacket open to reveal.candy. Yeah. Not a cliché move for a pedophile at all.. Not to mention the lyrics to his song were suggestive of wanting more from the little girl than to eat her as he went on about how succulent she was and ""without lumps"" and whatnot.. When Riding Hood comes across him a little further in the movie in her grandmother's bed I half expected him to be naked under the covers waiting for her. I have lost what very little respect I once had for him as an actor and well, anything. He was also only in the movie for maybe five minutes total showing that all he wanted was to stamp his name on this..though god only knows why anyone would want to.And oh wowCinderella..where do I even start? First of all, I'm not sure who chose Anna Kendrick for this role but I think the cow had better acting skills. While she could carry a decent tune, her acting never brought Cinderella to life and left me caring not if she would also end up randomly plunging to her death which there was a very good chance of happening apparently.Now..the princesoh yes. This movie actually makes me dislike Chris Pine a little now. He was absolutely ridiculous in this role. And, while I'm not sure if this was on purpose, it really doesn't matter. There was no place for his over the top take on Prince Charming. I guess his take on it was to make the prince a straight up douche.. which just left me confused. His acting this entire movie just gave off a ""rapey"" sort of vibe as he continuously hunted after a woman who ran from him on three separate occasions and went out of her way to hide and avoid him. The song between him and the other prince just had me cringing in my seat.. at one point they actually both tear open their shirts dramatically and I didn't even know what to make of it. It was like watching the over dramatic John Travolta performing ""Grease Lightening"" and believe me, I find that just as equally hard to watch.This leads me to the other two ""characters"", Rapunzel and her prince. These characters could have easily been clipped from this movie entirely and nothing would be missed. They were the most useless addition to the movie right next to the many ""songs"". Again, they blow in paper thin and underdeveloped and blow out just as easily. Zero character development leading to zero caring on my part about any scene involving the two of them.The motives of each and every character was forced and failed to make sense as well. The baker and his wife originally had the motive to retrieve the items that the witch asked for in order to reverse the curse of ""impotence"", essentially, placed on their house. That made sense at firstalthough stealing someones child as well as cursing their household on top of that all for taking a couple lentils and greens from a neighboring garden hardly seems like a fair punishment to me. But that's just me. Anyway, this made some sense at first. But right from the start the baker kept being a forgetful moron and splitting up with his wife who was clearly the smart one. And THEN actually retrieving Riding Hood's cloak only to GIVE IT RIGHT BACK to her when she simply screamed in an empty wood. Really?? I have now stopped rooting for you sir.Other strange behavior? The prince suddenly being an adulterous wretch and making out with the baker's wiferandomly.. not hours after wedding Cinderella. What is this teaching children? Especially when the baker's wife herself sings about having a man to provide the bread, and the prince for ""whatever else.."" wtf?? And this is a Disney movie?The music was unbearable. I can't tell you one memorable song from this movie. They all sounded the same and blended into one giant abysmal joke.I could go on and on about everything wrong with this movie..but honestly it could fill a novel. In a nutshell, it is the most disturbing piece of garbage I have seen in a while and the first time I have honestly considered walking out of a theater since ""Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End"".",Into the Woods
685,Ilo1214,Not a movie for kids,3,1 January 2015,"While I was watching this movie I was thinking this is by far the most disappointing movie I've seen in a long while. My husband was falling asleep next to me. First, it is a musical, so if you don't like musicals, you'll be disappointed from the very beginning, and it drags on for two hours. Second, if you went to see this movie hoping to see a fairy tale, that's not going to happen. The movie is dark,grey, black and dark blue colors and cloudy sky dominate the screen. Here is what I found, after I thought about what I've seen: this movie is using fairy tale characters to convey a message about real life, the obstacles we face, love, trust and cooperation, deceit, cheating and greediness, survival and kill or be killed. It also tries to make you see the light at the end of the tunnel, in the end, although most of the things have gone wrong and violence could not be avoided, there is still redemption and hope. Of course, this doesn't happen through the fairy tale happy ending, but through a more real-life imitating sequence of events. I gave this movie 3 stars because it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, because there were virtually no surprises, it was too long for the very simple plot and it contained a mature message delivered through a format I didn't enjoy. The actors themselves gave a good performance, but the story itself was boring. Also, too many characters didn't allow space for enough character development.

The scenery is also impressive. If you're looking for something that actually has character you can get behind, than I encourage you to view this film. If you're looking for a singing dog or something...this isn't the movie for you. This isn't frozen or lion king. Just because Disney is in connection with it doesn't mean it's something you bring your 3 year old to. They would get bored. It's more of an adult thing and has a good view fr each character.

688,matheus_f88,Should never have left the stage,5,17 December 2015,"This film failed in so many places I'm surprised I'm giving it 5/10 stars.Let's start with the incredibly inconsistent size of the woods. It might work on the stage, but it's really hard to swallow in film, because you can clearly see that the woods are supposed to be massive, yet the characters keep bumping into one another whenever the plot wills it so.And then the characters seem to lose sight of one another, and suddenly they're too big, so it's hard to find anything in them. That is extremely poor writing, it's as though the director didn't really care about making sense (which you cannot dismiss saying it's a fantasy, you don't expect space travel in Spider Man, and you don't expect guns in Lord of the Rings, nor do you expect the characters in Lord of the Rings to suddenly treat the journey from the shire to Mordor as walk in the park).There's also a LOT of exposition through songs in this film. It's not narrating past events through song, which would have been fine, but simple, pure, uncut exposition.What do I mean by that? I mean that every character *tells* us what they did and what happened and we, the audience who paid to see a film, can't see it. Jack sings about his trip to the clouds, Cinderella sings about the party, the witch tells us she found Jack is going to bring him to the giant woman. I cannot stress enough how much of a sin this is for a film.It's OK on stage, because you have limited budget, and sets, but cinema requires showing, not telling. They could have done what Little Red Riding Hood did and told the story through singing-flashback. Except, while that's the only point in the story that tries to adapt itself to a different medium, it's also a flashback to something the happened TWO MINUTES BEFORE. And we saw it. And we know what happened before and after. There was literally no need for a flashback or song-exposition at all.Another big problem with this film, which I suppose is a symptom of telling, not showing, is that many of the characters vocally express their emotions, but don't actually appear to feel any. One example I can think of is when Little Red Riding Hood approaches her grandmother's house she says something to the lines of ""how uneasy I feel"" with a completely blank expression. That's not just poor writing, that's a combo of bad writing, bad direction AND bad acting.The film itself is way too long, and could have been cut very differently. The story did not in any way shape or form need a song with the two princes trying to compete with each other to see who suffers more for love. We didn't need the scene where the baker's wife suddenly cheats on him - I say suddenly because it's never even hinted she might do that, or that the prince was a real womanizer. We didn't need a flashback-to-two-minutes-ago. We didn't need a scene where the baker brings a cow with flour on it because the white cow died, so the witch can revive it (that's an extremely short and unnecessary predicament, as it's solved in seconds). We DID need a scene where the witch finds Jack. We did need a scene that explained better why the witch commits suicide (it comes out of nowhere and has a really rushed explanation).Actually, I don't think we needed this film at all.",Into the Woods
689,bfrodine,Not as bad as expected,5,30 May 2015,"After seeing continuous horrible reviews from everyone, I decided to watch this anyways because I enjoy musicals and let's be honest, Chris Pine. I found it to be decent. I feel that if you look at each musical number alone, they're all good, but overall they were all very similar. However, most of the singing was very good, and I feel that Daniel Huttlestone (who you may recognize as gavroche from les mis), who played Jack, carried the film for me. Some of the transitions between scenes didn't make much sense. I was certainly not expecting to find adultery in a children's movie, but there was a scene where the baker's wife and Cinderella's Prince shared a few kisses, which (spoilers) led to the baker's wife's death and Cinderella dumping the prince. There were some graphic scenes that were a bit surprising for a PG rating. Overall, I don't think it was quite as bad as everyone kept insisting, and if you like musicals or fairy tales, it's a decent watch.",Into the Woods

I did enjoy two princes singing - that was funny, but otherwise terrible movie. Save your money!! Cast was great but unused talent. What were folks thinking. Tried to nap during the movie but woken up by the the notes off key. Movie was confusing and just wandered from song to song without an much of a connection to a story.

I consider myself highly invested in the musical having been at the world premiere at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego. After that, having watched the video of the Broadway show dozens of times and viewing local productions. This is one of my favorite musicals. I love what Rob Marshall did with the story and I was so pleased that he stayed true to the musical. The cast is stellar!!!!! Meryl is amazing (of course) and Chris Pine's portrayal of Prince Charming was hysterical. Johnny Depp was fabulous as the Wolf. I love, love, LOVED it! I plan to see it as many times as I can and of course purchase the DVD when it is released. Go see it!!! You will love it!!!!!!!!!!",Into the Woods
695,Weez_Cheese,"A brilliant, niche film which has been mis-sold to the general public",8,9 January 2015,"I admit that sitting the in the cinema waiting for this to start, I was a little nervous. I am a die-hard fan of the musical and looking round it became apparent that there was an odd mix of people here. I started guessing who would walk out first. Would it be the family of three small children, who may find the themes too adult? Or would it be the gaggle of middle-aged women who may only be here because of Johnny Depp's star power?Herein lies the problem, and the reason why there are a lot of 1 star review on IMDb - this is an inventive transformation of the original musical but it's really not for everyone. The first issue is that anything associated with Disney is viewed as ""fluffy"" by the general public, and that's not their fault, as the majority of Disney films endorse this. Secondly, on the back of reworked fairy tale films like Enchanted and Shrek, people can be forgiven for thinking this is the same. Thirdly, the advertising deliberately played down that this is a musical (not least an unusual one) so people bought their tickets thinking that this was a mainstream, A List celebrity rehash of some the best-known fairy tales. How wrong they are. The music isn't for everyone, and I accept that. These are not songs which can be taken out of context and sung on Britain's Got Talent. However, if you can get into Sondheim's style and Lapine's lyrics, you'll find that the songs are clever, heart-felt and often tell the story better than the dialogue does. The opening number (which is 15 minutes long) sets up the premise of the film better and more expediently than most films do. Like in the best musicals, the songs are integral for understanding character motivations, driving the narrative forward and bringing some of the real emotion to the piece. I was very worried about some of the casting in this respect, but I shouldn't have been. Streep adds a raw quality to the Witch with her singing which makes her seem vulnerable, and this interpretation really works. Anna Kendrick is perfect as Cinderella and whilst some of the other actors ""get by"" (Blunt wouldn't be able to play the character on stage) it does work. The children, Jack and Little Red Riding Hood, are fantastic, but this is no surprise given their musical background. The most pleasant surprise here was Chris Pine. His rendition of Agony is the best I've seen. It's a shame that some of the song cuts have been made. Agony Reprise would have provided some much-needed comic relief in the 2nd half and the omission of No More, whilst improving the pacing of the final 20 minutes, means that we don't feel quite as much empathy for the Baker's situation. Some people have complained that the setting is drab. I couldn't disagree more. Unlike most modern fantasy films, minimal use was made of CGI, with the director preferring (or was it a budget issue?) to film in real castles, barns and woods. This gives the piece an authentic quality which is now sadly lacking in a lot of films. The changing nature of the woods, from enticing to dangerous, enhances and helps to create the shift in mood. It also helps to convey some of the film's key themes and what the woods represent. The acting is virtually faultless. On the whole these are much more complex characters than in the original fairy tales, and film explores the (sometimes questionable) choices that these characters make with real success. The only exception here to these complex characters is Chris Pine's Prince; he is deliberately so two-dimensional that he works as a foil against the others. This is played for comic effect and makes the audience realise that ""happy ever afters"" are impossible when princes are charming but not sincere. I admit that I was worried about it being a Disney film, and a PG one at that. However, the material has been creatively used to make some of the darker elements more palatable for younger viewers. I'm sure that they would find the wolf scene a bit odd rather than disturbing, and the deaths are portrayed sensitively. Some parents will no doubt have an issue with what's shown, but one of the key themes rings true here: you really can't hide children away from the horrors of the world forever. The narrative by and large translates well to the big screen. Cinderella's ""Steps of the Palace"" works brilliantly in present tense and things which are hard to portray on stage (the giant, Cinderella's transformation, the magic, etc) work better here. Yes, it feels a little long but I don't think more could be cut without damaging the piece as a whole. Some characters have been cut altogether but these seem sensible choices given the format. The Narrator wouldn't have easily worked on screen and whilst it was a brave decision to cut him, I think it was the right one. Overall, it's certainly not going to be the blockbuster that Disney perhaps hoped it was going to be, but then it was never going to be that anyway. Fans of the musical will not be disappointed. However, it has a wider appeal than that; I went with a friend who likes musicals but didn't know the show and she loved it. It is complex and it is dark but I would much rather watch something with a bit of an edge rather than something saccharine like Frozen. If you do choose to see it, go with an open mind, a big bag of popcorn (it is rather long!) and give it the chance it deserves.",Into the Woods

With that said, I had no clue this was a musical. And, although I enjoy musicals on Broadway, never been a big fan on the big screen. So, to be fair, maybe that's part of the negative review. I went in with great expectations, and truly disappointed. Okay, on the plus side of things - - the music, scenery, and overall character appeal - - were beautiful at times. On the downside, the story line twisted the original fairy tales, making them dark and gloomy. It was painfully boring for the most part, and in addition to dark, words like ""silly"" and ""daft"" come to mind. It's very dark, with a lot of negative ideas for children. They even had the Prince attempting to solicit adultery. When I go to a movie, I want to leave feeling I was taken away. You don't get this feeling at all. I want to see the good in this movie.

Of course it helps to know and love the music. I recorded the PBS TV broadcast on my Betamax decades ago, and helped in a local high school musical production of Into the Woods. Perhaps negative reviews are because the viewer is not ready for it. That happens to me, sometimes. For example, I loved the Samuel Barber music ""Adagio for Strings"" so I bought a recording of his ""Knoxville: Summer 1915"". I HATED the music and almost threw away the LP. But I hanged on to it and a few months later listened to it again. Still didn't like it but I no longer hated it. Many years later it is one of my all time favorite musical compositions. I can't listen to it too often since I break down crying at the end but it is that good. So, if you are among those who did not like the film, for what ever reason, wait awhile and try it again.

I've heard the all of the music on it was really good.It was enjoyable especially in the first act. The only thing that wasn't amazing was parts in the second act.

Although the movie and the sound and everything was beautiful and breathtaking, it just lacked the 'movie feel'. There were some scenes where I kind of was like, 'Am I watching a high budget all-star cast movie or a stage production?' They stayed really true to the original musical and that's cool and all but I was really hoping they adapted it so we got to see a little bit more talking scenes and more of a movie-flow.

703,regal-photography,"Sondheim, Sondheim",6,1 June 2015,"First let me say I am a fan of musicals. (That seems to be an issue with some reviewers.) I also am well aware of who Stephen Sondheim is and of the controversy that surrounds him.That said, let me first speak of the positives. The cast is great. One may never see a movie that has been casted so perfectly. Each shines in his/her own way and are quite memorable and enjoyable. Everything else concerning the making of the movie is equally top-notch from the production to directing to makeup, etc. So considering this, why do I rate it a 6? The story and the music.The story is at times clever, attempting to meld so many fairy tales and doing so rather well. I liked the ongoing metaphor of ""Into the Woods"" and there were some very nice moments along the way but the problem arises with all of the twists as the stories wind down. Simply put, there are just too many and some are absolutely unnecessary.And then there is the music. Ah, Stephen Sondheim. As I said before, I am fully aware of Mr. Sondheim. I know that he was taken under the wing of Oscar Hammerstein II and was deemed heir-apparent to the Broadway throne. But something went awry.Don't get me wrong, Sondheim is obviously a very talented man, but his greatest talent seems to be lyric writing. Unfortunately, his lyrics are usually overshadowed (or should I say overwhelmed) by his music which is ultimately unsatisfying.Sondheim has been a polarizing figure for 5 decades and the controversy usually concerns his music. He is in good company, though, as orchestral music and the general public divorced some time ago. This divide appears to be unbridgeable. Those in the know claim that they ""get it"" and lament about the decline of civilization and the ignorance that has overtaken the public. Hollywood also projects this intellectual superiority so they gladly become the useful idiots of the cause. When the inevitable flop occurs then, tsk...tsk... we just don't ""get it."" Let me speak, if I may, for the uneducated masses. GIVE US SOMETHING TO REMEMBER! The problem with Sondheim, and modern music generally, is the total lack of tuneful melody. Think about it - you don't leave the theater singing a single tune from ""Into The Woods."" The only memorable moment for me was the two princes singing ""Agony!"" and that due mostly to their performance of it. The last song was okay but the rest sounded like the same song or even a two hour recitative. There was a time when great theater and tuneful music walked hand-in-hand. Oh for those days! It IS possible for the intellectuals and the masses both to be satiated. Until that day occurs, if ever, let the elite have Sondheim. For the rest of us, is there anyone out there from the school of Jerome Kern, George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Richard Rodgers, Frederick Loewe - people who can write brilliant, memorable melodies that are sung on the way out the exits of the theaters, and will still be sung a hundred years later?We are desperately waiting.",Into the Woods

I enjoyed most of the songs but others are right, I am a Disney fan that wanted some more dancing and a few happy endings wouldn't have killed anyone (literally). It was a beautiful movie visually but a little too long and a little too sad for my liking. It's Christmas! I wanted to leave the theater feeling happy and whimsical and light.

The plot was a complete mishmash of fairy tales which, to be honest, stuck more closely to the original than your usual Disney film, but just stumbled from one scene to another. And just when I thought it had mercifully finished, it started all over again. And when the ending did arrive, it was completely unexpected.

Sondheim is my favourite composer and I think the film did justice to his lyrics and music. Those of you who could not understand it or follow it, cannot be a big lover on psychology and human behaviour. Sondheim is a psychologist! The woods represent the paths we choose in life, and how wishes cannot always lead to wonderful happy endings (true to life!) You go on your journey, and experience joys and pain and heartache, which you learn from. You finally discover yourself and your true purpose in life. Those of you who said their are no memorable songs in it are not listening to the deeper meaning of those lyrics.

707,nate-dahl,"It may have worked on Broadway, but that's an entirely different audience...",1,6 May 2015,"One of Broadway's favorite pastimes is to take something innocent, uplifting, or moral and make it dirty or dark and cynical. Take Cinderella's prince and have him abandon her and make love to a married woman instead, set it to music, and you will have backing from the so-called ""progressive minded"" social elite. Throw in some pedophilia and sexualized youth for good measure and your show will be hailed by the critics as ""fresh"", ""original"", and ""edgy"". The only thing I find surprising about ""Into the Woods"" is the omission of homosexual themes (although I was waiting for it during the duet of the two princes). On Broadway, same-sex sells!Don't get me wrong, sometimes material like that, when artfully done, can be creative and entertaining, and, anyway, far be it from me to criticize other people's tastes. It's everyone's choice whether or not to buy a ticket.However, this film adaptation of the stage musical is not artfully done. In fact, it stinks. Moreover, it's PG rating, the subject matter (popular fairy tales), and the Disney brand gave me the idea that this was a family-oriented movie, suitable for children. Not so.These things happen - not every successful stage production translates well to the screen, and in many cases it's at least partly due to the difference in audience: what gets a standing ovation in New York City might leave middle-America in their seats, or worse (again, that's no criticism of either New York City or middle-America), heading for the exit before the end of Act 1.Steven Sondheim has a large following and is somewhat of a Broadway legend. Nevertheless, I found the music in ""Into the Woods"" very uninteresting. I felt the same way when I saw Rogers and Hammerstein's ""Flower Drum Song"" (1961 film). It lacked the polish and elegance of their earlier works (such as, ""Oklahoma!"", ""The King and I"", and ""South Pacific"") and seemed kind of a botched effort with glaring flaws that perhaps the people around them at the time were too embarrassed to point out to those two great and aged men of the Theatre. Sondheim, by the time he wrote the music for, ""Into the Woods"" in 1987, had reached nearly the same stature. One key element missing in this show is the lack of a signature tune. Every musical should have one, IMHO - and most do. For example, ""Somewhere (There's a Place for Us)"" from ""West Side Story"" (lyrics by Sondheim), ""Some Enchanted Evening"", from ""South Pacific"" (Rodgers and Hammerstein), ""Getting to Know You"", from ""The King and I"" (ditto), and, more recently, ""Memory"" from ""Cats"", (Andrew Lloyd Webber), etc... In fact, almost every Andrew Lloyd Webber show has its signature tune that has been recorded by some major artist and gained popularity outside of the show itself (I'm thinking of Streisand's rendition of ""Memory"" and Yvonne Elliman's, ""I Don't Know How To Love Him"" (""Jesus Christ Superstar"") as just two examples - there are many more, of course. In short, I think this film production should have kept the dark immoral snarkiness of the stage version - maybe it would have received an ""R"" rating, but that would, in turn, have kept the families with children (thinking this was a ""family"" movie) away.As for the shortcomings of the score, I think live recording would have helped (it tends to keep you interested, even when the tune lags).",Into the Woods

I try to avoid him (he's on TV wherever you look) but this time I had to PAY to see him....In truth, it was OK for an hour... some bits were great, I was reminded of the Sweeney Tood Musical in places (which I enjoyed), and some jokes were good (one song involving 2 Princes was good, poking fun at the genre)...The film had potential to be awesome... everything that is good in the film is more or less in the trailer.... James Corden put in some good performances actually.After an hour I was waiting for a divine piece of pulling the story lines together top mean something, have a common revolutionary truth, just aching for that moment where you go ""ohhhhh, I get it.... genius!"" but that never came. I was trying to work out why my daughters were laughing / enjoying themselves so much, but it turned out they were taking the mick out of the film every time a new song started.... Iwonder actually if the plan is to ""pull a Mama Mia""... i.e. be so rubbish, so bad, that it's good... If that was the Disney plan, it didn't work....

Well, where do I begin with this?! If I could give this film a -10 I most definitely would! Lets start with the trailer - Completely & utterly avoids any aspect of this film being a musical! I was dragged to this film by my wife as she was dying to see it. She didn't decide to tell me it was a musical so you can imagine my surprise after agreeing to go and see it based on the trailer being...okay..ish! Now lets dive into the film (if you could call it that) - The opening song felt like everyone just talking over each other over and over which instantly drove me insane. I didn't know who I was trying to listen out to! Little Red Riding Hood was the most annoying little girl I think I have ever seen. Her voice was so monotone it drove me crazy! The thing I find most RIDICULOUS about this whole movie are the messages that are embedded within. Now after discussing the film with many people, I understand that the play/musical isn't aimed at children. So why on earth Disney decided to take this and put their twist on it I will never know! I usually get on with Disney adaptations being a HUGE Disney fan myself. They completely dropped the ball with this one! A peadophillic fox chasing a girl and singing about her being juicy. The fact that Prince Charming commits adultery and is just brushed off because he is 'charming'. Are these really things that you would want your children to watch and think are okay? I don't even have kids and I was still concerned about this! I also don't understand how a giant falling over is enough to kill it? Im still struggling with that one! I get the one that fell off the beanstalk but the last one doesn't make sense. Seems like the ran out of ideas in ways to ruin your children minds and just decided to end it.There is only 1 good thing about this film and it is the part when the 2 princes are singing. I don't know if it was supposed to serious or just making fun but either way it made me giggle.Overall summary - Never watch it!

710,Jordan-Howell,A Perfect Misunderstood Gem,10,14 January 2015,"Into The Woods is a stunning musical by Stephen Sondheim that has been very well adapted into its film form. It brings to life beautifully different music which deviates from the usual bubble gum pop that appears in most other musical movies. The music is intricate and lyrically clever adding greatly the the story being told.Unfortunately it seems that every reviewer on IMDb does not have the brain capacity to grasp the point of this film. The point is to deviate form the well known fairy tales and tell a new version of the truth in which the happy ever after is questioned. Not hard to grasp, and interesting as it pushes all of us to consider what happens after the ending.I also cannot understand peoples problem with the rating. Nothing in this film is overtly offensive. Yes there are some underlining sinister themes, but that is an example of good film/theatre making. No child is going to sit there and even notice or care about these moments. They are there for the adults with half a brain to see and be impressed by. So that we will question what we think we already know as truth. Death also plays a part in this film but nothing is shown in graphic detail. Come on people, lets face facts that death is a part of life and also part of most films. I'm sure you and your children had no problem with the death of the parents at the start of Frozen? And yet the death of a giant attacking the land has caused uproar!This film is wonderful! The cast is wonderful! Emily Blunt shines in a role she was born to play. Meryl Streep as usual creates a well rounded and fundamentally delicious character. The comic turns of both Chris Pine and James Corden are wonderful, and as usual Anna Kendrick show she is born to be in musicals.Everyone needs to go out and watch this film again. Appreciate the intricacy of the music. The daring to be different plot. The wonderful acting and vocals. A two hour roller-coaster of adventure and intrigue. Instead of moaning about not knowing when the ending is coming or whats going to happen, maybe enjoy the fact that for once you're not sitting down to a completely predictable children s film.This film is a classic before its even begun.And i only ""wish"" that you can all give this movie the congratulations it deserves.",Into the Woods
711,ben-strang-6-109497,I have fallen in love with this musical,10,25 March 2015,"I think that it is really offensive that people have given this film a 1 out of 10. It may not be suited to everyone's taste but it is certainly not deserving of a 1. Stephen Sondheim is by far the most amazing musical composer. His lyrics are clever, interesting and when sang by such great vocalists, they are thoroughly enjoyable to listen to. All the actors perform with accuracy and they are all very well suited to their characters. When I heard that James Corden was going to feature in this film as The Baker, I was unsure whether he was going to play the role accurately. After watching this film at the cinema, I was extremely impressed with Corden for his wonderful portrayal of The Baker. All of the actors perform with naturalism, enthusiasm and they all sing pitch perfect. The thing I love the most about this film is the fact that it is very genre bending. The haters of this film need to realise that the story behind this film is incredibly clever and that a lot of time and effort must of been given to create this witty, lyrical heavy musical. The only criticism of this film which I have is that I feel that it shouldn't of been a Disney film. It's as if they've just added a label. If it wasn't Disney then it could of been more graphic. For example: The Baker's Wife death could be more clear and also Jack's mother's death could of been more believable instead of her just falling back onto the ground and dying. If it wasn't Disney then more explicit detail could of been added which would of probably made the film a 12 instead of a PG. I believe that this film is suitable for any age although it may be too complex for younger children even though the story is about fairy tales coming together. The modern twists add a very interesting affect to the story and I love how many of the songs are showing the inner decisions that the character is trying to make. This film has the best cast that a film has ever had, the best music, exciting story-lines and excellent humour. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves happiness and who wants to be taken on an emotional journey.",Into the Woods

713,CarotToppe,Worst movie in YEARS!!!,1,29 March 2015,"I am BEYOND disappointed with this movie!!! I have actually performed in this show on theater and loved the show...After seeing the release of the trailer was afraid to watch it in theaters because the trailer already seemed awful...Even with a cast of names that include Meryl Streep, Chris Pine and Johnny Depp who I love, I was still put off by the trailer.Thank fully I did not see it in the theater, did not purchase the DVD and only forked over $4.99 to watch on Demand. I don;t think this movie is worth paying $0.01 for.They basically tried to use well know names to make the movie a profitable production, instead of casting less know actors/actresses that can carry the tune and reach the range of notes that the original score was written in.If you are not familiar with the theater show there are high Soprano notes for the female cast and Bass to Tenor tones for the male cast..These songs were unbearable and I actually had to fast forward through a few of them to actually get through the entire movie.The scene with Cinderella's Prince (Chris Pine) and Rapunzel's Prince (Billy Magnussen) was the MOST excruciation and painful things I have dealt with in years!!! They even went to the extent of having Billy Magnussen open his shirt to show his abs in a desperate plea to get viewers attention, that was NEVER done in the theater show. On top of that they made scenes more perverse than they ever where in the theater show.I would not even suggest ordering this on pay-per-view, video on demand and don't even wast a DVD shipment getting it through Netflix. AND DON'T LET YOUR KIDS WATCH IT!!!! They will be questioning the song that Johnny Depp does about singing of a young girl and what he wants to do to here and they will be questioning what Meryl Streep means when she mentions rape.I had to gave this movie a 1 out of 10 as a vote because they don't allow numbers below that, I personally would give this movie a -10. I personally feel embarrassed for the cast myself.",Into the Woods
714,ingrid-grongstad,Truly amazing! Loved every moment of it <3,10,7 April 2015,"I was so appalled by reading some of these negative reviews that I just had to write one of my own! I am a musical fan, and I have always been one. When seeing this movie, I was not aware that it was an ADAPTION of a BRODWAY musical. I was pleasantly surprised, and fell in love with this movie. It is so complex, so refined and beautifully made, you could not hate it. And if you do, you are clearly not a musical fan, and then the movie is not for you. I am not saying that the other reviewers are not entitled to their opinions, but I would ask them, do you really care for musicals, because reading them, it sounds like you do not. And that is okay. But if you do, you should give this movie a chance! You'll be better of for it. Stephen Sondheim beautifully fits music from the musical into this movie, and is doing so with style. Rob Marchall directs a focused but energetic cast that all(oh well I do not love Chris Pine as a singer but..) sings with glints in there eyes, enthusiasm and clear love for their craft. Meryl Streep does a horrifically thought at times endearing role as the witch, ugly but with her one true wish is to not embarrass her daughter Rapunzel with her looks any more, and in her pursuit of her earlier youth and beauty rallies the Baker and his wife to break her curse, and her mothers curse. I was really impressed with how modernly the plots are woven together, and how the movie is not scared to delve on serious issues or break with Disney tradition. This is a big step for Disney, making a movie based on the fairy tales they have developed from the Grimm brothers versions, and changing small things about them, and looking at darker aspects of them. I love a lot of Disney's work, don't get me wrong, but it is refreshing to see that they can make a movie for an older audience and still keep some innocence within the characters. For me, watching this did not shatter my childhood perceptions, and I do think that we coddle children too much in protecting them and making the fairy tales so black and white. No, Cinderella does not have to end up with the prince, and a witch can be both cruel and have a human side. Red Riding Hood is not perfect and innocent, and Jack, thought a little slow sometimes, can cry and love a cow. The need for happy endings and silver linings and believing in them is fine, but not every Disney movie has a moral obligation to do so! And life is not like that, so why not prepare children for a glimpse of a fairytale-land with a sense of how real life is? I would show this to my niece aged 9 because I think she is intelligent and complex enough herself to understand this. Give the children some more credit ;) The best song for me has to be No One Is Alone, but Gigants In The Sky, Hello Little Girl and Moments In The Woods are all really good songs, not to mention Meryls amazing Stay With Me. I got such chills when she sang it, and for a moment I was reminded of Mamma Mia and the moment she and Amanda Seyfried shares when she is preparing her for the wedding. It teared me up, and thought I did look back to another movie, Meryl really owns this role in all of its ugliness with pride and no fear. The Bakers wife as Emily Blunt was a genius choice. I haven't been this impressed with an actress for a long long time. I did not know she could sing so marvelously! Anna Kendrick is, as always, amazing in her effortless role as Cinderella, and James Corden was a nice surprise. I know I have seen him somewhere before other than his talk show, but I can not remember where.. Also Daniel Huttlestone as Jack does an incredible job. Thought Lilla Crawford does a good job both singing and acting, she disappeared a bit for me in the mist of all these amazing actors. Anyway, I will stop rambling now. Just know that in terms of story, music and not to mention effects and sets, this movie is truly amazing, and if you are a musical fan, and a fan of musicals being made into films, you will love Into The Woods, and it is definitely worth a watch!",Into the Woods
715,neelumhassan,Confusing,3,26 March 2015,"Am I honestly the only person who is going nuts as to how Rapunzel's hair being cut TWICE was so easily neglected by everyone on earth?

What started out so well ended up having no emotional connection with the audience whatsoever. Poor!

""Anything can happen in the woods,"" goes one lyric, and the same might be said of Hollywood musicals. Get me the hell out of the freaking woods. It is an overrated musical. It last like forever. Despite Meryl who is amazing as always, nothing much to see there. Anna K. is pretty muck boring. The first two-thirds of the film, which are like the Brothers Grimm's Greatest Hits on laughing gas, have a fizzy, fairy-dust energy. But as soon as the baker couple's scavenger hunt is over and a rampaging giant appears, Woods loses its magic and momentum and sags like an airless balloon. For a movie so hip to the conventions of fairy tales, it sure doesn't know when to cut to happily ever after. Enjoy good movies.",Into the Woods

I went to watch this with a group of friends and the movie starts off pretty well. The music is wonderful, the acting is great and the story line is creative. Act 1 finished off with a neat and nice ending. HOWEVER, there's an Act 2. I've only seen one other musical so I didn't expect this 2nd Act. It takes quite a sharp turn in the story line. It's still entertaining but it's not necessary to have in the film. I understand it's meant to be a new twist of the classic fairy tales but it just wasn't has refreshing as Act 1. It was a re-make though. What can you do...Should you watch this movie? If you're the type of person who likes these play/musicals then go ahead!! If you're like me who knows a brief amount about it..maybe not? Personally it was good but it was kinda 'meh'. I immediately forgot about it once I exited the cinemas.",Into the Woods

I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

719,paulkelly402,Split the Difference,8,28 March 2015,"Yes, I gave it a largely positive rating. I have heard most of Sondheim's musicals, including the stage version of ITW. This one, like Follies, is emphatically not a kid's fairy tale. It is, in fact, nearly a nihilistic assault on the very idea that morality exists and if any attempt to be moral emerges, the person will almost certainly get it wrong.That's Stephen for you, actually. And Disney has a problem: the original Act 2 is simply beyond endurance for anyone who believes in providence (as I do). I know that bad things happen to good people (my own son spent a year on military duty in Korea, then came home and was killed in a car crash going home from morning PT, how's THAT for unjust death?) but the point of art is to make sense of the universe and ITW, as staged, undermines this entirely. Now, that is part of Stephen's original point, but it is entirely contrary to the very definition of Disney. It is said by others that perhaps Disney should have let this one go to, say, Tim Burton. Maybe so, but I don't think so.Burton made quite an adequate Sweeney Todd. ITW would not have advanced his art at all and might well have been a retardant. To cut as Disney has done has not softened the original point, it has generated a moral point in what is otherwise a Godless nihilistic universe and that's a plus to me. Life without hope is not worth living, it is only existing. As ITW stood originally, I left it with no hope. Some survived. Some should have. Some shouldn't have and did. Perhaps that's the AIDS metaphor. But life needs hope, so even if some injustice carries through to the film version, less than the stage version does and that permits the world of ITW to be at least a little bit rightly ordered. And that's the plus. We learn that making mistakes can be dangerous and can be deadly. We learn that families can be built with those who need a family. This is the right lesson. And Disney teaches it. Eight stars of 10.",Into the Woods
720,diogodacostaferreira,Worst film ever,1,5 January 2015,"First the film in the IMDb is not classified as a Musical which is an error. Second the film has nothing to do with a Musical all music sound the same the actors must be furious after being a part of something not even the performance of great actors like Merryl or Emely Blunt could disguise this horrifying movie. the only thing good about this film are the moments when they don't sing, music production was one of the worst I've ever heard I'm still thinking how it's possible for someone to do such a bad job, do they don't have ears?! It's not even funny how bad it is just outrageous that someone has to pay to see this horror. This director it's on my blacklist now, just like all the cast, actors who do this kind of work are not great actors there just ""speakers"" who throw up the argument.

721,queeneden-lw,overall view of the movie,5,1 April 2015,It was a good movie and also a very good story line although i had felt there had been way to much singing. I know it was a musical but i feel as though the movie in general could have been a much high rated movie if it hadn't been purposely made into a musical. It would also be OK if there was a song every here and there but not through the entire thing! The chosen actors that had played each part had done really well in portraying their character really well. Also i was quite happy to see that they had shown the Grimm version of these fairy tales - the original version of fairy tales. I thought that the movie had been really good overall and i would very much enjoy watching it again if there is less singing. I intended no offense at all to this movie or to the amazing actors in this really good movie. But these are my personal opinions.,Into the Woods

The characters are simply maddening, from the drawling, whining Red Riding Hood to Streep's simpering witch who surely misses the point entirely. I'm not even going near the wolf on here...The logical end to the film is only halfway through, with the baker and his wife now with a child, Cinderella married to the Prince and Jack and his mother having a bit of cash, (albeit stolen,) where everyone could live happily ever after. But no, from thereon in the storyline descends into complete misery. The witch disappears down a hole in the ground, the prince starts an affair with the bakers wife while her husband and Jack murderously plot against the giant's wife who is quite rightly on the warpath due to Jack's earlier house invasion and killing of her spouse. A few more durges later and we're finally done thank goodness. A rotten ending to a rotten film.",Into the Woods

I'm disgusted that they tempted me with big names in the cast then completely let me down. I;m also disappointed that the big names actually took this job. I'll be wary of those names in future movies because this was so very mind-numbingly boring and senseless.

Despite the frantic efforts of a very talented cast, no matter how loud they sang, no matter how much vibrato, it was all just a sonic catastrophe that actually made the dogs, for the first time in memory, actually LEAVE THE LIVING room. The melodic asymmetry pervasive in all of the songs -- I think it is actually a lone concerto-length apocalyptic tune -- is so unimaginably bad that I was initially riveted, thinking I was missing the joke.

Pretty much everything you see in this film is visually stunning and all of the acting is terrific and everyone in the movie does a terrific job with the part they play. But, everything about the story-line is disjointed and chaotic. There is no main character. And 90 minutes into the film, what plot there is shifts and goes into a completely different direction. The worst thing about this movie is that there is not a good story as the foundation, or maybe something was lost in translation. I definitely love the the visual aspects of the film.

I liked that the movie didn't end in the first 75mins but it kept going because for once i didn't want a happy ending to come that easy.

Great casting, it was as campy and wonderful as I hoped it would be. There were some complaints over the number Agony, being off key but it is supposed to be a cheesy number. Meryl gives once again a perfect performance, and the reveal of her younger self is fantastic.

728,icyslayergirl,Interesting musical,3,29 December 2014,"This was an interesting musical but it tended to really drag on. The film lacks a sense of wit and adventure. There was entirely too much singing and it brought the story to a complete halt. The comedic high point was when audience actually busted out laughing during the Princes duet - Chris Pine is absolutely hilarious as Charming, especially in his performance of ""Agony""! It is unfortunate that, due to time and too many plots to contend with, Rapunzel's story line seems to have been sacrificed, so it is both underdeveloped and ends abruptly; but because of the way characters are woven in and out of the film, it would have been impossible to cut her entirely, and both Magnussen and Mauzy are very good in their limited screen time.The actress that played Red Riding Hood was annoying - you actually hoped she would die off. I will say Meryl Streep was amazing and there was not enough of Johnny Depp. All of the singing was great as they all could actually sing. I wouldn't recommend this for children. I wanted to take my niece and am actually glad i viewed it first.

Sondheim's music sparkles with his use of repeated motifs and clever lyrics. The melodies are still careening around in my head a week after I saw this film with my wife and sister. For those who have given this film negative reviews, it is a musical for Pete's sake, and the actors will sing their lines!

A horrendoma is a medical term for a tumor that is unable to be cut out or destroyed in any other fashion, or a fatal disease or syndrome that cannot be cured. It is just absolutely horrible.

Even my little 9 year old cousin thought the movie was; and i quote ""kinda boring"". There are lots of parts that don't fit the original stories, and not in a good way. I will say the witch was played very well. But i just can't get over being tricked into watching a 2 hour musical. When, in none of the commercials was it indicated or implyed that it was a musical.",Into the Woods
740,debcohen2,Brilliant Broadway Musical Wonderfully Realized on Film,8,26 December 2014,"I can't help but wonder if all the haters had ever seen a Sondheim musical, let alone Into the Woods, before. Sondheim isn't for everyone. I'd seen two touring Broadway productions as well as the televised Broadway cast production starring Bernadette Peters years ago, and have always loved this show. In fact, it's my favorite Sondheim musical. The movie wasn't flawless, but I still found it truly wonderful, and intend to see it again.Having fallen in love with Bernadette Peter's portrayal of the witch, I felt very strongly that she owned that role and could not (and still don't) understand her exclusion from the movie. That said, Meryl Streep did not disappoint in either her acting or singing. Not less than Bernadette, but different, so I was able to really enjoy her personification of the witch free from resentment. On the other hand, while Johnny Depp's performance as the wolf captured his lechery, he just doesn't have the pipes to do the song justice. Casting actors who can't sing, or who can't sing well, in movie adaptations of great Broadway musicals is a long standing pet-peeve of mine (It was all I could do to not walk out of the Sweeney Todd movie). I give him 2 out of 3 for his look and his acting, but his singing failed to make the wolf all that he should have been.I loved all the rest of the cast. The kids were annoying how? Lilla Crawford has a wonderful voice and was well cast. Jack was younger than I was used to from the Broadway productions, and had a strong voice, albeit lacking in vibrato. ""Agony"" was a real comedic high point. I wonder if the ""Agony"" reprise was shot and not used, ditto the ""No More"" song that didn't make it into the film. I wish both had been included. The movie was visually stunning. I went to an 10:30 AM showing on Christmas day. The theater was almost completely full, and the laughter during the movie and the applause at the end indicated my enjoyment was shared.",Into the Woods
741,Kolomiyetsigor,Worst movie I've ever seen in my life,1,26 December 2014,"I wanted to fall asleep within seconds, no pardon me, milliseconds. The constant singeing was a drowning death, one that causes the greatest pain I've ever felt in my life. I will pray for all victims that watched this movie.At first there was potential, the wolf was very entertaining, but when he didn't kill anyone I was displeased. Every character except the wolf or witch was boring and mundane, this movie is for children. I felt like drowning myself lower and lower into the seat as I watched the most boring movie of all time. I wanted to throw up, fall asleep, and leave all at the same time. Warning: if you don't like wasting your time, don't wades your time and see this movie. My only hope was that life moves on, time continues and eventually this movie will end. My horror will not last a lifetime: except it dragged on and on....and I am sober and must drive, yet I feel this movie is a poisonous drug which has made my soul unconscious. I pray for all who have endured this terrible movie.",Into the Woods
742,elliebizot,"Very talented cast, but plot and pacing were lacking.",7,26 December 2014,"The first half was wonderful, fulfilling, and left me satisfied. All plot lines had been resolved, it was a bit cliché and cheesy, but nothing atypical of a Disney movie. Then, disaster strikes. The plot takes on a rather dark tone and becomes very hurried. All comedic and lighthearted aspects are kicked to the curb. Not to mention two of the main characters are promptly cut from the movie in a very unsettling way. All seemingly happy endings are completely dissolved in pursuit of an ending that more so reflects the harsh realities of the world. This did not take away from the talent of the cast, however, and all the musical numbers were fantastically written. All in all, the movie was great, until the downturn of events that went a bit too far and left you feeling confused, upset, and unsatisfied. The amazing first half and extremely talented cast is enough to make this movie one that is engaging and memorable.",Into the Woods
743,Scott-Hoppe,"""Just Because""",2,27 December 2014,"I don't know what movie all the other reviewers watched, but it most certainly wasn't Disney's newest musical ""Into the Woods"".The movie was a discombobulated mess, with multiple plots shoehorning each into the other (and even literally says so in a part of the movie). The songs were also forced in many cases that only seemed to be placed there to distract from the stagnant and sputtering pacing of all the plots.What really made the movie awkward was lack luster tropes they put the characters into. The Princess running from the Prince because she feels he is too good for her. The Witch that wanted her beauty back, because well, she wanted to be pretty again. The child the Witch kidnapped, hide away, then banished to a snake infested swamp, because (and i quote) ""I was trying to be a good mother."" literally no other explanation or reason for doing so. Also, Cinderella can talk to birds, let me repeat that, SHE CAN TALK TO BIRDS **AND** have them do things for her, like spy on people and have them PLUCK OUT her enemies' EYES, and with this GD super power she is a lowly chamber maid having the birds pick up lentils, F-ing LENTILS. The 2 princes have a duet where they are trying to out sexy each other, most likely as a type of fan-service to their 12-16 year old female audience. This movie heavily played off of Grimm's Fairy Tales. If you have not read them, you aren't missing anything special. The stories might have been revolutionary when they were written, but now-a- days, they would garner maybe a B- on an 8th grade writing assignment.Just like my title says, this movie's plot seems to be driven by the phrase ""Just because we can."" They don't give any reasoning for the characters motives, their role in the story, or any of their actions. The whole movie was made for shoehorning in songs. Just because they can.In all honesty, there was so SO much potential for the movie to be great, but along the way, it turned into a cheap knock off movie version of ""Once Upon a Time"" with music.",Into the Woods
744,yetemlion,LEAVE the Woods,1,27 December 2014,"This movie was absolutely, positively HORRIBLE in every sense of the word. I generally don't write reviews but I was so incensed by the stupidity of this absolutely ridiculous crock o' s*** that I had to spread the word. I don't see how this movie got any positive reviews at all. I had high hopes because of the cast and I generally like what Disney makes, but this was horrendous. From the first song on, it was a disaster filled with repetitive, pointless songs that attempt to provide moral guidance but definitely DOES NOT. This movie instead has hints of rape, pedophilia, adultery, shitty parenting and basically half the cast is killed off with the remaining cast not seeming to really give a damn as it ends with the Baker starting to re- tell the same shitty story that just happened to all of them (in which his wife died, little red riding hood's grandma and mother died, and Jack's mother died)... This movie actually got me to dislike Meryl Streep a bit, which I thought was almost impossible. Johnny Depp was really not in it, he was in it for maybe 5 minutes top. Chris Pines was the ONLY good thing about this movie, and that was basically just for one of his songs which was amusing. The actress who played the little red riding hood was incredibly annoying and emotionless - if she had been killed off the movie might have been decent. I almost walked out of this movie but stayed hoping for some kind of salvation of the film towards the end -but NOPE! All in all, this was ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN, and I don't say that lightly. Please don't waste your time and money, or at least consider yourself warned.",Into the Woods

The trailer and previews are miss leading with shots that did not made it to the final product. Most boring film ever since Pitch Black. These type off movie its not appropriate for children and modern generations. There is a very small percentage of people that like musicals. That's why they made promotional videos very limited hiding the truth cause if they would tell the truth they knew this movie would not sell well.

They'll be begging to tell everything they know. The two stars are for (1) casting Chris Pine and (2) the musical number ""Agony"", which was delightful. Even Meryl Streep and Johnny Depp were awful in this tedious, direction-less mess of a musical that is completely lacking in continuity. The songs are overburdened with lyrics that the writer must have thought were terribly clever... but with not a single memorable melody. DO NOT take young kids to this film unless you want to explore a dark mash-up of beloved childhood tales that explore themes like pedophilia, murder, mutilation, adultery. I cannot believe studio executives sullied the Disney name by releasing this stinking turd of a movie - the antithesis of everything that was good about ""Frozen"". If I hadn't been with extended family, I would have walked out. Unless you are an ardent fan of the original Broadway musical, stay away!",Into the Woods
747,lczaplys,Some brilliant moments but overall not rewarding,3,28 December 2014,"There is some great singing and a number of fantastic scenes in Into the Woods. However, overall, this movie is a real downer. Not a movie for kids or romantics.Into the Woods takes a number of fairy tales, mixes them up, and spits out a very muddled and confusing film. Unlike most fairy tales, there is no happy ending for any of the characters.For example, the baker's wife (played by Emily Brunt) and childless because of a magic spell, learns the lesson that she can have a husband, a child, and make out with Cinderella's prince before she falls off a cliff.At some point, Into the Woods began to seem endless. I found myself wondering if the movie would provide any kind of emotional reward for watching it. It didn't. Don't say you weren't warned.",Into the Woods
748,Logan_cole,It is Beautiful and Spectacular,10,28 December 2014,"First i want to just say this movie surprised me in many ways, I actually didn't expect this movie to be so good. The music was incredible, the story was great due to that they stuck with the Grimm stories core. All the actors were perfect, some actors were known but then to take a D roll hand full of of actors and make them shine like that is amazing.Now I read some of the other reviews on here I keep seeing just the worst reasons not to enjoy this movie. Some are saying the stories are ""not right and too dark"". Well it is spot on the Grimm fairy tales and they actually lighted them up a bit, taking away the actual blood and not showing any gore. Then people are complaining about the actors.(like always) All I have to say is that they did a great job with picking actors. They took Chris Pine a actor mainly known for action and showed us what he can really do. Just from watching the song Agony by him was jaw dropping, I'm glad i know what he can really do and I hope he does more movies like this. Also taking a young actress only know for Broadway and putting her in this was also great to see, Lilla Crawford was amazing.I highly suggest this movie to those who enjoy musicals and fairy tales. I do think it shouldn't be PG, due to the darker aspect of the fairy tales. But overall you will be blown away with outstanding music that keeps the story moving in a nice pace. The actors and their performances will have you in awe with there singing and acting. Then the creative beauty of the scenery and colors is just amazing, truly is beautiful.

This storyline is rich with moral teaching on contentment and discontentment. Listen to the lyrics and you will hear and learn about life. Stay with Me and Children Will Listen are from parents perspectives. Into the Woods in a metaphor for going out into the subjective unknown. It's about life between where one Is and where one strives to be. It is about acting on your feelings and intuition but it is a tale of caution. It reminds that life without object morals and rules is chaos. I could go on but I won't. It was well done.",Into the Woods
750,andewright,Worse than Butterfly Morning and Toke,1,28 December 2014,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I can't believe I sat through the whole thing. I knew that ""Into the Woods"" was a musical, but I never dreamed the singing would continue, almost nonstop, throughout the movie; singing the same tune on and on, but with different words. Anna Kendrick's screeching voice is understood by crows. Two princes rolled around on rocks singing ""Agony,"" and I thought, ""This movie is agony and painful."" Some other character later sang about a nightmare, and I couldn't have said it any better. Before seeing the movie, I read reviews that this was a movie for children and adults of all ages. I have to disagree. What was inappropriate were the sexual connotations, violence (e.g. cutting off toes and a heel of two girls, then blinding the two characters), and the death of some beloved characters. (If the cow could be resurrected, why not the decent dead characters?) Rapunzel and her prince could have been cut out of the movie. They were of no importance to the story. Johnny Depp played the same creepy role like he did in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" and Anna Kendrick as Cinderella was confusing.And now for the length of the movie: ""Into the Woods"" goes on and on and on . . . Right when you think it is over and everyone lives happily ever after - WAIT! you're only half way through; there is still another hour of agony to go.I don't want to give away any of the ""good"" parts, so I will leave it at this suggestion: Don't waste your money or two hours of your life seeing this, and please don't take your children!",Into the Woods
751,snyderpa-198-217501,wretched,1,28 December 2014,"A wretched musical with rotten musical score, plot befitting a porno, and only one scene with character development. Maybe the special effects were OK if you go to movies just for special effects. The all-star cast were given roles without sufficient emotional depth to allow them to be authentic. From the start, the musical phrases are trite and awkward, no doubt partly because there is not much to sing about other than 'going into the woods' which apparently is supposed to have some metaphorical significance that doesn't really develop. The whole thing reminds me a lot of the old Wizard of Oz yellow brick road trip. This was a waste of money and 2 hours of life.p.s. If you knew me, you would know just how awful a movie would have to be to move me to register for IMDb to write a review -- and this movie crossed that line very early on in the two hour ordeal. It's badness is epic. It fails to entertain. The trailers should have just shown people singing boring music, because that's all this show is about. If you see good reviews on here, trust me they are not from general movie-going public, probably they are shills with some interest in this movie's success. And don't fall for the Emperor's New Clothes line of how ignorant the bad reviews are -- this movie is unforgettable, and that is a bad thing.",Into the Woods
752,alexs-198-456931,Horrible/ Misleading/ Boring,1,29 December 2014,"First off- this movie is a MUSICAL which Disney so cleverly seemed to forget to point out during the trailer, Im not a Broadway fan so I was quite surprised when the first 20 minutes was one long mindless song in which the characters would sing about anything that came to mind. After that settled, the ENTIRE movie barring maybe 15 minutes is all one giant uninteresting song that had no charm or zest to make it memorable. The few big things I will point out to discourage you from watching this mess is the singing was dreadful and unmemorable, confusing and thin storyline that seemed it was made through a game of pin the donkey, the cast choice was weird especially Anna Kendrick who did not fit the role of Cinderalla at all. Also how the movie dragged on for another 45 minutes after seemingly ending nicely after which many people decided to leave the theatre.My main conclusion- lots of potential- falls completely short through the slowness and utter chaotic storyline, dreadful and boring songs that engulf the movie into a mindless musical about utter nonsense, and a cast that you wish would disappear 20 minutes into the movie. Disney tricked me into seeing this knowing that it being a musical would not attract many people, but movies like grease put this disaster to shame. 1/10- (one positive- I had a fantastic sleep during the last 20 minutes)",Into the Woods

754,bstewart2954,"Yes, It's Dark.",8,29 December 2014,"Overall, the stage-to-screen adaptation of ""Into The Woods"" is, in my opinion, a success. Yes, it's dark. No, it's not really for kids. But this is not a ""Disney movie."" It's a Stephen Sondheim musical. Sondheim musicals often that way. It just so happened to be produced by Disney, that's all. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1987, so please, don't bash the film for being ""too dark"" or not following the ""Disney formula."" You've had plenty of time to look it up and see what you were getting yourself into. That being said, the film is not without fault. The film does stay fairly true to the plot of the original script, with the exception of a few key changes––some successful, or at least passable, while others prove more problematic. However, many of these issues are overshadowed by the terrifically-cast ensemble. Chris Pine is a delight, in a welcome departure from ""Star Trek"" and ""Jack Ryan"" that allows us to see a nice range. Billy Magnussen, too, shines here with a more chivalrous take on Rapunzel's Prince. Opposite Magnussen is Mackenzie Mauzy, who delivers a great Rapunzel, despite the character losing some of her character development to the adaptation process. James Corden is good, too, bringing with him a nice dose of comedy, though perhaps at the expense of occasionally sounding as though is just reading words off a script. Though Meryl Streep perhaps struggles a bit with the Witch's Rap, ""Stay With Me"" and a very impressive ""Last Midnight"" more than compensate, putting her more or less on par with Bernadette Peters in the role. Emily Blunt, of course, delivers a dazzling performance as the Baker's Wife, but her choices with the character do make ""Any Moment"" a little more out-of- nowhere. The actor's job is first and foremost to justify the text, and, during ""Moments in the Woods"", the Baker's Wife, though starstruck, does not seem willing to cheat with the Prince. However, a strong performance in ""Moments in the Woods"" seems to almost acknowledge this, and justifies it. Lilla Crawford is perfectly suitable for Little Red, and Johnny Depp, too, delivers a good job as the Wolf. Anna Kendrick does a better job than expected, as well, proving a higher level or ability than ""Pitch Perfect"" would suggest. The only issue in the cast is Daniel Huttlestone. Understandably, after a solid performance in ""Les Misérables"" as Gavroche, he was commandeered for the part of another young boy in the next major movie musical. It shows––he seems to essentially play Jack as Gavroche II. Unfortunately, something about his performance robs Jack of the sympathy the character usually garners. This is quite disastrous for Jack––for the first time, I saw just how guilty he was during ""Your Fault"", and realized I wouldn't mind if the Witch succeeded in resolving the plot by just feeding him to the Giantess.Leading up to the film's release, the announcement of several changes to the plot managed to cause quite a stir. The biggest changes in this version are, of course, found in Rapunzel's storyline. Instead of meeting her end with an unceremonious stomp by the Giantess, she is saved from her banishment to a swamp by her Prince and, after spurning the Witch one final time, the two ride off and are not seen again. Though this change made quite a stir when it was first announced, it's understandable: firstly, as Rob Marshall explains, Rapunzel's death in the musical is treated as something of a joke, and as director, he felt her subplot could be handled with a little more respect. Secondly, it is likely that, due to the recent release of ""Tangled"", Disney did not want to meet one of their new princesses to be met with such a grim fate. This also accounts for the changes in the character of Rapunzel's Prince, who now, unlike Cinderella's Prince, remains faithful throughout the film (as the reprise of ""Agony"" was cut) and adheres to the Disney standard of hero.In all honesty, having gone into the movie knowing Rapunzel would be spared (and perhaps having had some time to wrap my head around this change) I took very little issue with the scene. I did not mind Rapunzel living through the end, and I did not think that this change did any damage to the impact of the Witch's Lament. ""Children can only grow from something you love to something you lose"" seems to make more sense in response to being abandoned by one's daughter due to one's own actions rather than to losing one's daughter to a giant's foot.Additionally, I did not mind the changes to Rapunzel's Prince's character. I am always interested to see a new take on a character, and given the changes to the script, it works perfectly. Billy Magnussen is also fantastic, and I am very glad to see him make such a successful transition to the screen after seeing him in ""Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike"". However, this change does create some problems as far as pacing. As the reprise of ""Agony"" was cut (for this as well as for time), Cinderella's Prince goes straight from marrying Cinderella to cheating on her with the Baker's Wife. Cutting the reprise does not let us see that the Prince is beginning to tire of his marriage and look for new pursuits. Also, Cinderella's Prince's absence between the wedding and ""Any Moment"" seems rather conspicuous (though perhaps this is not so for those unfamiliar with the stage version).Overall, despite some problems with the script and casting, Rob Marshall proves that he can make a movie musical that can replicate the success of ""Chicago"". Changes, darkness, and all, I think ""Into the Woods"" has been a success.",Into the Woods
755,zedlinz,One of the worst films I have ever seen,1,29 December 2014,"After reading the reviews posted, I'm wondering if I saw the wrong film. To me, ""Into the Woods"" was a confusing mashup of fairy tales, with random music interspersed between the tenuously linked story lines. Now for the record, I am a regular subscriber to musical theatre, so I am not a redneck genre hater. Hell, I even liked Xanadu (the movie). I love most of Sondheim's musicals, but this one got away from me almost from the start. The concept of darkening everything up did appeal to me, but I was so confused by mid film, that I stopped caring. And what was the message of the film? That cheating on your spouse is OK if you're a powerful man, but not if you're a woman. That terror is a tool to reach your end goal. The end justifies the means, so its OK to lie, steal and cheat to achieve your goal.I hope the cash that you laid out for the star power in this one gets the tax break you were looking for. On a positive note, Johnny Depp was delightfully creepy as the wolf.As the great philosopher Bart Simpson once said ""This movie sucks and blows at the same time"".

But after 45 minutes I just couldn't take any more and yes, I had to walk out of the Theatre.The only thing I would say is there was an all star cast.

Seems like the ending was more about indoctrinating kids that wrong and right don't exist. I enjoyed the beginning and how multiple stories are integrated logically. But, around the middle it seems like all the steam is lost and as if they just did whatever to finish it by ming the songs longer and they just loosing all creativity.

At around 90 minutes it looked like the movie was going to end and my misery was going to finish. But to my surprise there was still another 45 minutes of the movie. I did not know what else could they fit into it.

759,beckinah,Very Disturbing,1,30 December 2014,This movie was very disappointing. I could not believe that Disney would attach its name to this garbage. This should not have been rated PG13. Things such as Johnny Depp as a pedophile wolf and Meryl Streep's psychotic relationship with Aurora might suggest that it was sexual. Emily Blunt's scene of adultery with Cinderella's husband banging her against a tree definitely made this inappropriate for me. This is definitely not a movie for your kids. I could not believe my eyes or my ears. The songs were not as cleverly written or composed as one would expect from a Disney film. Even more difficult to understand was that the movie continued even after the curse of the witch was broken. It seemed in-cohesive somehow. Why bring in another giant? This made the movie feel like it was 3 hours long instead of 2. What is worse is that Disney has made most of these stories like Cinderella and sleeping beauty iconic. Why would Disney turn their most beloved storybook depictions into a creepy nightmare? Very contradicting. And a big mistake on their part.,Into the Woods

Other than the fact that this movie occludes some key songs (First Midnight, Second Midnight, Agony Reprise, etc.) originally in the production; I think it is a WONDERFUL representation of what the story is supposed to represent and portray.

She then dies falling off a cliff leaving the baby behind. Cinderella is an indecisive girl running from a prince three times and pausing on the steps of the palace to see if she should run or not. For the baker couple to have a baby they have to steal four things. The mean stepmother just brutally cuts off the parts of her daughters' feet to fit the slipper... Do I have to continue?

And the writing, one of the most creative twists and melding of fairy tales I've ever seen. A creative and inspiring job.So, why only a 6? Here are the jeers, I'll try not to reveal much. First of all it's a musical on known fairy tales. Half way through the movie, all seems well and is apparently coming to some hokey live happily ever after ending, but it doesn't. The plot completely twists and movie is prolonged another hour. This extension made it hard for the 4 and 5 year old grand kids to sit through. And then, in this extension, all sorts of characters meet their fate. I realize it's a PG film, but come on. You're basing your whole skit off of fairy tales. In the words of my 5 year old grandson (as he was getting obviously impatient with the length of this movie), ""this movie has a lot of sadness."" And there were various points that left unanswered questions in the end. The ending left the viewer with so many questions as to the fate and connections of the various characters that actually survived to the end. Bad writing on that part.I realize it's important not to make a plot too hokey, the audience will end up feeling disconnected and gypped in the end. But this took it to the far extreme and consequently, I ended up feeling rather disconnected and gypped. Don't take the kids, and don't fooled in to some fairy tale ending, and you might just actually enjoy the movie more than I did.",Into the Woods
765,jlockwood30,Save your money,1,1 January 2015,"For those who liked the play save your money and go see the play. This film was a poor adaptation with maddening unsympathetic characters. The extreme efforts and great acting of individuals could not make up for the horrible script, pedophilia and rape undertones, and horrible moral guidance. The songs are all sung in the near same tone and were poorly integrated with the action. This is the first film in 30 years I've wanted to throw my drink at, yell boo, and leave. I gutted out the last of the film to give an honest review. The film was so horrible it motivated me to open an account and review it. The premise was interesting and brought me in. The cast kept me sitting, hoping it got better. I can't get that time back. A very poor film for children, annoying and maddening for adults. With plot holes and inexplicable insertions. The cast tried their hardest and individually acted well but the film direction, production, script, and song lyrics made for a horrible product. The visuals were the only redeeming value. And not to spoil but the moral lessons are questionable at best.",Into the Woods

So when you can't get in to see one movie and need to pick another, you are caught completely unaware. This movie was beyond terrible. It was so bad, I almost walked out half-way through and asked for a refund. I want 2.5 hours of my life back. The trailer made it look like it would be like Maleficient or maybe Neverending Story, which were both dark and amazing. But this was pure garbage. Very questionable tones of pedophilia, blatant infidelity, they break out into pointless singing just when you think a scene is mercifully finally over, and it's far too long. Worst movie I have seen in a really long time.",Into the Woods

I was expecting something more like a fantasy type movie with an occasional song in it, but pretty much the whole movie was like an opera with the actors singing every line. I slept off and on after the first 30 minutes of the movie.. a couple funny parts, but definitely not worth dishing out the bucks at the theater even if you like this type of movie.. no special effects for the big screen. Enjoy it at home on Netflix or something cheaper. Six of us went to the movie today and only two of the six mildly enjoyed the movie. 4 kids, 2 adults. 2 young children found it most amusing.",Into the Woods
768,MissRhyse19,Beautiful film adaptation of a most-loved stage musical!,9,12 February 2015,"This is not like any Disney film you would expect. The first half of the film is really fun and exciting where everyone gets their wish granted. The film follows the Baker and his Wife breaking the curse of infertility put by the Witch next door. The Witch promised to undo the curse if they would fetch her four items from the woods: the cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn and the slipper as pure as gold. Into the woods they went, they will cross path with four fairy-tale characters we know and love (maybe some of you) from the original Brothers Grimm - Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Jack (and the beanstalk) and Rapunzel. Each character will go to great lengths to get their wishes and they will live happily ever after. But not for a long time. As the film continues the story took a dark turn at the end where fairy-tale meets reality with each character has to deal with their consequences for their wishes. Remember, 'Wishes come true, not free'.I would recommend to parents to check on the MPAA ratings if this film maybe dark for their little kids. But Disney made a great effort in toning the film less darker than the stage musical. So I'm sure kids will enjoy the film as well. There are quite a lot of changes made in the film especially the last half where the dark twist happened. Well, Into the Woods is really a difficult musical to adapt to film but I still loved it as it is. The songs in the film are important as it is part of telling the audience about each characters' feelings and their motivations. Without it the film is useless. It would be about characters roaming the woods for nothing. This film is an almost sung-through musical with some dialogue. Don't think it is like Les Miserables where it is all sung- through.Overall, it is an enjoyable and exciting film to watch for the whole family and for lovers of musicals. Those who are not familiar with the stage musical of Into the Woods but loved the film, watch the 1991 stage musical version. you'll love it as well!",Into the Woods
769,babyrnliz,"Play or not, the movie isn't good",3,1 January 2015,"I have never seen the play (and seeing the movie has not given me a desire to). There are some lovers of the play on here- some very snooty (one said you shouldn't review the movie unless you see the play, REALLY? They are 2 different things, get over it) I expected a musical- a Disney movie based on fairy tales, you should expect music, BUT 95% of the whole movie is sung in the same melody over and over, with a few specific numbers breaking that up. None of the songs were particularly memorable, with the exception of ""Agony"", which was the best thing about the whole movie. They say ""into the woods"" so many times that if you wanted to make a drinking game of it by taking a shot every time they say it, you will need a case per person, and will still run out before an hour is over. The little red riding hood and big bad wolf scene made me uncomfortable. I felt like he was going to rape her or something, it was very sexual and she looks about 10 years old. My boyfriend didn't get the subtext because he couldn't understand everything that was said. This was true through a lot of the movie. Ever listened to a song on the radio and couldn't understand the singer so you had to look up the lyrics? It's like that... but for 2 hours. At one point had the movie ended, I would have had a totally different feeling about it, but instead they decide to continue for another hour to be the anti-fairy tale, something they could have done by more satire through the first half. Again, the song with the 2 princes on the waterfall trying to out macho the other (Agony) achieved that, but the joke didn't come across that well because the rest wasn't a comedy (if it was it wasn't funny). There were several plot holes- examples are spoilers Rapunzel's hair is cut off my the Baker's wife, but suddenly it is long again when the Prince comes in the next scene. But when the witch cuts it, it is short forever. The Baker never finds out Rapunzel is his sister. The witch has no magic when she is beautiful, did she have it before when she was beautiful? Cinderella's Prince wants to cheat on her although he had already been alone with the Baker's Wife and didn't want her then. Here's the truth---- I don't care if this was a great play. Movies and plays are different and that's why most movies made from a play or vice versa make concessions for those differences. A play that is sung from start to finish is enjoyable, but rarely is this true in movies which is why there are so few of them. I wouldn't see it again. That is for sure.",Into the Woods

But if you enjoy the wry wit, wicked satire, and quicksilver musical brilliance of a Sondheim musical, then by all means go. And remember, it's an ADAPTATION of a stage musical. Theater and film are two different experiences and mechanisms, so expect some stage-friendly content not to be present. Also, I guarantee there will be audience members who came expecting the full 'Disney fantasy' experience who will be as clueless as a balletomane at a tractor pull.

If you value your time enough, and still watch the movie - you will probably create an IMDb account and try and save as many people as possible from committing the same mistake (like me).All of this happens because of a curious mixture of a musical, in a fairy tale, that is targeted at adults (and has child inappropriate themes) about abstract notions communicated in a really poor manner.Ps: If you enjoy philosophical good/evil questions in a random context and have seen the eponymous play and like it - you may like the movie (but really confirm you are that person)",Into the Woods
772,erservis,A very bad musical,2,3 January 2015,"When reviewing about a musical (yes it's a musical although the trailer is misleading) there are two parts to focus on: Music and lyrics. Music was poor, lacking variety and had repetitive tones that made the overall experience so tiring, causing annoyance even from the first 20 minutes. None of the songs were memorable (except one which was audible) because your brain just wants to forget them. Lyrics, well, most written just to make a rhyme. As for the script, it mixes up some of the most loved childhood fairy tales into something pointless and confusing. There were unethical acts introducing adultery and violence (which make the film unsuitable for kids) and huge plot holes ruining the coherence. Also none of the characters manage to fascinate you, to feel compassion or trigger your interest to what will happen to them. Along with the average constant singing, in the end, you just pray when it will be over because your head starts to ache. I created an IMDb user account for the first time because i was so disturbed from this movie that i had to to warn other people ASAP. I give two stars only for the actors worthy casting effort.",Into the Woods
773,ladybutterflyyuko,Well done Disney!,10,3 January 2015,"I went today with my sister to see this movie, ever since I saw the preview I knew I had to see this film. Sondheim has written some of the best musicals including Sweeny Todd and West Side Story and Into the Woods is right up there in that classification. Now into the movie, this movie is a musical through and through, it takes the fairy tales and turns them on their heads; when thinking of the Disney versions of the stories everyone lives happily ever after the end. This however is not the case in this version of the tales.Spoilers!!!!:With Cinderella and her Prince yes they dance together and she runs away and he tries to trap her by use of pitch on the stairs and she chooses to run but leaves a shoe, they end up together but he strays and makes out with the baker's wife in the original version they do more but for Disney they clean it up and I personally am grateful for that I don't need the other stuff to enjoy the story. So in the end things are not happily ever after.The Baker and his wife cannot have a child, so desperate they ""steal"" items or con their way into getting the items so they can have a child. In the end their wish is granted but things are never perfect and she dies because she runs from a giant and falls off a cliff.Jack and his mother have issues but so do every parent and child, he trades the cow for magic beans (true to story) and winds up with the beanstalk and giants and in the end happily ever after till the final act.Little Red Ridinghood learns a valuable lesson after dealing with the wolf while headed to grandmother's house and in the end looses her home. Finally the wolf oh the wolf yes for those in other reviews saying he is like a creepy old guy in a van that is the point and frankly they cleaned him up A lot for the movie, the original styling for the character on the stage was a lot more intense and from what I remember he is practically naked. End Spoilers!!:This movie is great, Disney did an amazing job bringing this musical to the big screen, this is not a movie I would bring little kids to; since these are not the fairy tales they are used too they might become confused and bored. To those saying that Disney mislead you and fibbed with their trailer they most certainly did not, it was clear from the get go that this was a musical based movie and it was going to be a musical film! Rob Marshall was the right man for the job and he certainly did this musical justice. Granted the end is a little wonky but that is just because they cleaned a lot of the story up to make it appropriate for a wider range of ages.Spoilers!!:The original story has characters dying such as the Baker's wife, has the two princes and their brides grow bored of each other and sleep around and the Baker and his wife grow bored of each other and fight and sleep around i.e. the Baker's wife and the prince in the forest. You want happy endings and clean stories stick with the cartoon versions of these stories then.End Spoilers!!:The original concept behind fairy tales was to teach a lesson and that is what these did. Not everything ends happily and that was what the Grimm brothers were trying to teach, along with any other fairytale writers :) So enough of my ramblings but if you love a musical and love a satire then this movie is for you. Disney hit the nail on the head and certainly did not disappoint and the casting was spot on. Chris Pine certainly made the movie for me and I will be listening to him sing over and over and over again.",Into the Woods

I have to admit that the first part of this movie was passable and even at times enjoyable. Second half of the movie however, seem to be about how the screenwriters could completely ruin these classic stories. It was so incredibly inappropriate for Disney to allow the production of the story. I nearly got up and left the theater. Commentary about life lessons set in the films second Half would have been better left to other stories and other characters. I base this on my personal opinion that the creators of these stories did not intend for their characters and their stories to be used in such a vile way. Additionally these timeless Classis stories with lessons about life all of their own, these stories provide hope for people struggling in life and yet with the twist on the last half of this film that hope is severely mangled and the original lessons in those stories become obscured. The one shred of joy I was able to take out of this stupid movie was that the bakers going to get him some Cindarella and a couple extra hands to put to work in his bakeshop LOL.",Into the Woods

James Corden and Emily Blunt are warm and lovely as the Baker and his wife. I was amazed at Blunt's tuneful voice and good comic timing - an excellent casting. Streep is much better here than she was in Mamma Mia and full of pathos before her transformation. A terrific performance.I'm not sure the little girls in princess dresses who were part of the audience at my showing knew what they were in for - this is an adult show in my view. With that (and Disney) in mind I was happy to accept the fabulous voice of the little girl playing Red Riding Hood, although the clear sexual allusions in Sondheim's libretto were a little lost in translation but I'll live with it.My favourite scene was the stunning interpretation of the two princes outdoing each other in their singing of Agony. Chris Pine was a revelation here. Do go and see it - perhaps several times - but leave the kiddies at home!!",Into the Woods

However the movie was disjointed trying to pull together too many story lines and leaving many actions incomplete. Also the theme takes a major turnabout at the end which makes no sense. Is the director really trying to examine our morals and beliefs about fairy tales? Also the movie was too long, having many should be ending points but was dragged out. A final note is that the movie is not for young children. We took our 8 and 11 year old's with us but would think again about taking them again. There is no foul language or directly visualized violence in the movie but there is plenty of it occurs in this ""fairy tale"" and the attempted moral concepts the director gives us may not be understood by younger minds.",Into the Woods
777,mnms8868,Not for younger viewers,3,4 January 2015,"Let me begin by stating I love musicals.I had no idea what this movie was about. My kids wanted to see it since it was Disney & based on fairy tales. Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack & the Beanstalk, Rapunzel.All the stories intersect & everyone meets up in the woods at some point.Music/singing was good, not great.It wasn't a bad movie however I think it should be marketed toward older kids (13 & up) since this is based on a play for adults. This movie destroys all the happiness & joy of fairy tales & leaves you with a bitter pill to swallow. Mean spirited, nasty, thoroughly unlikable people. At least Meryl Streep (the witch) is honest, mostly. Fine give a moral, there's no happy ever after, whatever. At least do it with class. I imagine Walt Disney rolling over in his grave over this.My kids (boys, 10 & 11) liked the movie for the most part. Were disgusted by the kissing, confused by the wolf's desire (see spoilers)& happy for it to end. Way to long.This movie could have/should have been 10 stars but: *SPOILER* Johnny Depp as the wolf-A pedophile's wet dream. I have lost all respect for him. And he's only on screen for a few minutes. Blink & you will miss him.Prince Charming cheating on Cinderella 5 minutes into the marriage. Nice.The Baker's Wife is punished for entertaining the thought of another life (with Prince Charming) by falling off a cliff. Of course, blame the woman when it was the Prince who kissed her. Actually, in retrospect it seemed more an attempted rape. More like Luke & Laura from General Hospital back in the early 80's.So in the end the Baker, Cinderella, Jack & Red form a commune? Rapunzel & her prince just ride off? Okay at least we have 1 fairy tale not ruined.",Into the Woods
778,patricklh2014,Confusing AND Disturbing,1,5 January 2015,"Spoilers, you've been warned.OK, so I've never been a Broadway/musical fan BUT, I do appreciate a good story when I see one. Into The Woods was not one of those good stories. First off, the story starts off with an incredibly repetitive and rather annoying song which is supposed to introduce the major characters but instead turns into a montage of all the major characters spouting the same lines with slight variations over and over again for 15 minutes too long. In reality, pretty much every song is the same repetitive nonsense with the exception of one song sung by the two princes which is refreshing in it provides just a little bit of humor which is utterly lacking throughout the rest of the film. Next problem is the lack of character development. All the characters feel shallow and you have a hard time finding a character to be interested in and honestly I was more interested in the damn cow for the majority of the movie than any of the main characters. Third problem I had was pacing, things go from 0 to 100 real fast and then it likes to hit a wall in the form of another repetitive 15 minute song in order to completely throw you off. Fourth problem is the really disturbing and graphic material that somehow slipped into a PG rated film i.e., Johnny Depp's character and the rather obvious allusion to pedophiles using candy to lure unsuspecting children or Cinderella carelessly sicking her bird friends on her step sisters to peck their eyes blind in some twisted sense of revenge, the list goes on and on. And last and probably the biggest problem I had with this film was the overall confusing plot. My girlfriend and I spent the majority of the movie trying to figure out exactly what was happening and just when we thought we were getting a grip on the plot the whole movie would make a U turn and head in a totally different direction. Characters' thoughts and actions are void of all logic. I may just be ignorant for never having read the play but I was utterly confused when the witch just decided she had enough of everyone and TURNED HERSELF INTO MUD. In addition, the story makes many really interesting connections between the characters but then simply fails to explore those connections, the biggest for me being that Rapunzel and the Baker are actually brother and sister. Instead of exploring this connection the two never even come into contact with one other nor do they actively pursue one another. What's worse is that Rapunzel seems to play no significant role in the movie whatsoever which is apparent when she just disappears part way through the movie with her prince never to be seen or heard from again.Overall, the film is incredibly boring, confusing, and at times, disturbing, and will leave you looking for any excuse you can think of to shuffle out of the theater in search of a movie actually worth watching.",Into the Woods
779,marie-kalm92,A big hope missed,1,5 January 2015,"I felt this movie held a lot of potential but definitely fell short of what I consider Disney's magic. I would not recommend and I wouldn't see it twice. The plot twisted so many times I'm not sure what they were going for. I didn't feel like the characters resonated with their audience. I also think it was disappointing to see such big name actors to such a shabby what seemed like half ass-ed job. I have always felt like prince charming is charming in every sense of the word (in that he is brave, kind, honest, and just charming) and to watch him become this jerk in the film was a little bit of a dream killer for all us Cinderellas out here I the real world.",Into the Woods

All of the voices are crisp and beautiful, as well as the instrumentals. The plot of the film, however, takes away from the fantastic music. In the beginning or other wise known as Act I if you knew this was originally a musical, the storyline is clear and makes you aware of each character and their story in the film. After the wedding scene however, the movie goes downhill from there. I don't think each film re made about a fairy tale should be perfect and completely happy but there was a tragic downfall for every single character. After the wedding it is about taking down the giant, and how each character works with or against one another to save the kingdom but the way it was done seemed to be a little messy and confusing.

I agree with reviewers that warn to not take young children. DO NOT TAKE YOUNG CHILDREN TO THIS MOVIE!!! This movie has hidden sexual references and dark themes. I believe that children ages 13+ are better suited for this movie. Kudos to Disney for attempting to recreate a PG-13 (possibly R) rated MUSICAL (Into the Woods is based off of a musical written in the 80's) and trying to make into a family-oriented film. I am familiar with this musical and understand the changes that Disney has made (because, you know, Disney can't have a PG-13 movie and has a standard that all movies must have happy endings). I actually personally ENJOYED this musical. It has humor, and while may be somewhat dark, shows that not everything in life can have a happy ending. Many things have been changed for rating purposes, however. To name a few: some songs were added and taken out, Rapunzel was supposed to die along with many other characters, and the baker's wife was supposed to do ""you know what"" with Cinderella's prince instead of just kissing. Parents complaining about taking their children to see this movie have obviously never done their research or just made the assumption that because it is Disney oriented, it's like all other typical Disney movies. I DO RESPECT EVERYONE'S OPINIONS!!! I am just pointing out the things I have seen people complain about while reading reviews. Musicals are not for everyone, I get that!

It was like they wanted to use humour but then switched to seriousness without a lead up. It felt like it wanted to tug at the heartstrings at times but then changed its mind at the last minute to try shrug whatever was happening off. Its very hard to explain in particular as I do not want to give a spoiler.All I can say is that I walked out of the cinema not really sure whether I was impressed, disliked it, enjoyed it, was disappointed. I cant pinpoint it to any one feeling, just a mixture.Don't get me wrong, its worth a watch! But I just don't know whether they had an underlying feel they wanted to achieve or whether they just didn't know themselves what sort of feeling they wanted and so threw them all in at once (Note: Feelings such as love or hate, happy ever after or not so happy ever after, focused for kids or focus for adults...maybe its just a depiction of what real life is like??)",Into the Woods
786,bruphils,"It's an uneasy trip ""Into the Woods""",7,8 January 2015,"Stephen Sondheim. James Lapine. Walt Disney. Rob Marshall. Meryl Streep. Emily Blunt. And Johnny Depp, Tracey Ullman, Chris Pine and Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel and Jack and the Beanstalk.Sounds like a combination for a sure-fire blockbuster, and Into the Woods almost makes it, in more ways than one (according to the IMDb, Woods has grossed $92M as of January 5). Woods is not your Disney fairy-tale so I'm quite pleased that the company took a risk and produced it. It might tip over into the magic $100M (it probably will, counting overseas receipts) so Disney's risk is paying off but the film itself is less than a blockbuster.It's not the fault of director Rob Marshall. He juggles the disparate story lines masterfully, preventing them from collapsing into sheer chaos. I especially liked his dark, gloomy production design, a cross between Tim Burton and Clint Eastwood.But this is a dark musical with no jaw-dropping, explosive production numbers like 'Cell Block Tango' from his ""Chicago."" It's even darker, more intimate and introspective.Summarized, a baker and his wife learn they are under a curse of infertility by a forest witch. She gives them a chance to reverse the spell within three days. They undertake the quest, which brings them into conflict with Cinderella, Rapunzel, Little Red Riding Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk, who are also in and about the woods doing their own things. But there are no bright, sparkling moments of Disney-like magic. Deadly danger lurks everywhere.Sondheim's intent was to show that reality trumps fairy tales every time, and if we really want a fairy-tale ending then we need to be careful what we wish for, especially when it comes to spouses and children.He also brings a nuanced vision to the story. The man who wrote musicals about Sweeney Todd, the serial killer, and Assassins also gives depth and complexity to these characters. Cinderella flees the ball because she's afraid the Prince won't want her if he discovers her true identity. She's almost right, because she's married to a prince (Chris Pine) who was raised to be charming (played by Chris Pine's blue eyes) but nothing else (by his own admission). But, even though Sondheim was at his peak when he wrote this musical, and he always gets respect for his intelligence and integrity, the story feels overburdened and overly ambitious. There's too much going on, especially in the last act and the story feels a bit too long (running time is 125 minutes).The cast, though, is first-rate, and they're allowed their own singing voices. Meryl Streep is the unforgettable glue holding the stories together, delivering another top-notch performance. Johnny Depp, as the Big Bad Wolf, makes the most of his short scene. James Corden and Emily Blunt, Baker and Baker's Wife, get the most screen time. Their chemistry is real, and they deliver the best rapid-fire songs in the show. Anna Kendrick even makes the wishy-washy Cinderella believable and sympathetic. Of special note are juvenile actors Daniel Huttlestone as Jack and Lilla Crawford as Little Red Riding Hood, who hold their own against considerable adult talent.The movie--the story--trips but the stumbles are minor and all the talent involved keeps the story from falling on its face. It's not your parent's Disney, but its story, of human resilience and connection in a dark forest of a world, is very much with us in 2014. Not bad for a musical from 1987.",Into the Woods
787,dnvr-grl,Great!!!,10,8 January 2015,"I was so excited when the great play I love was being made into a movie with such great actors! And I was not disappointed!I can't believe so many people didn't like it, i guess it is partially because this movie is less sugar coated than the fairy tales they are used to.This movie makes the message of the classic fairy tales painfully clear as shown with Johnny Depp's great performance of the wolf in such a way that it is obvious that the message of the tale is Don't GO ANYWHERE WITH STRANGERS BECAUSD THEY COULD RAPE YOU. That's what the story is. Okay, rant over. Please see this amazing movie.",Into the Woods
788,tim_burton_fan-208-502962,Horrendous,1,9 January 2015,"**WARNING - SPOILERS**I wish I could rate this film 0 because there are quite literally zero positive comments I could make on it. Quite simply an awful, AWFUL film. I would even go as far to say that it is the worst film I have ever seen!!From the very start this film begins badly, with an incredibly irritating opening song which just seems endless. However I tried to remain positive, see it as bumpy start which would hopefully improve. How wrong I was. The film just got worse and worse!The storyline starts out promising, a mix of classic fairy tales we're all familiar with, but with a twist. However the plot quickly becomes very confused and makes little sense! Whilst I personally thought it was good to emphasise the darker elements of these Grimm classics, and I think younger children can enjoy & understand it, this film was over ambitious and included one too many fairy tales. What I do not agree with or appreciate is the depiction of the Big Bad Wolf. I am a massive Johnny Depp fan, but I am shocked that he went along with this particular character. His portrayal of the wolf was extremely uncomfortable to watch, it's almost as if he's attempting to seduce Red Riding Hood. Depp's performance is extremely creepy and sexualised. In the short space of time that he is on the screen I, and many of the audience in the cinema, were left cringing and uneasy!The film is just a downward spiral from start to finish, with increasingly confused scenes and plot lines. The whole story just felt very rushed, as if they had tried to cram too many fairy tales into one film and couldn't really tie them all together e.g the super speedy explanations of jack climbing the beanstalk, the eventual disappearance of Rapunzel completely from the film and a failure to link the Baker and Rapunzel together despite them being brother and sister!!The film ends up being a long, arduous journey for the audience as well as the characters on the screen! A few people in the cinema left halfway through, and I wish now that I had joined them!! A complete waste of time, and whilst I thought it was great to have a few unhappy endings the ones in the film were just beyond ridiculous and, again, rushed!",Into the Woods
789,maikeru-208-12133,Awful. Hopefully not a sign of things to come from Disney,1,10 January 2015,"I found this one really hard going and am finding it hard to say anything nice about except that I liked the concept of finding a common thread to bring together a number of fairy tales. However, at times this felt like forcing square pegs into round holes- for example changing Cinderella's ball into a festival and having her run from the Prince three nights. It is a musical and I love music, however I found the soundtrack amelodic, predictable, and painful. AIt actually made me sad to think that the days of the beautiful melodies of earlier Disney films may be a thing of the past. The ploy was not engaging and pressured and the script was trite and glib, the props (particularly those from up the beanstalk) were tacky an unconvincing).I love musical, I like a lot of Disney movies, I also enjoyed movies like Jack the Giant Killer and Snow White and The Huntsman.I didn't like this. I couldn't make it to the end and so am not sure how it turned out-that seems like a much lesser evil than having to sit though the remainder of the film.",Into the Woods
790,sniffle24,A mix of different stories from the Brothers Grimm turned into a musical.,1,10 January 2015,"I couldn't finish the movie, it was that awful. The storyline wasn't so bad, in fact, I found their different take on some of the stories I read as a child quite entertaining and interesting. However, the awful awful awful songs, which all had one tune, was just too much. Furthermore, some of the characters' voices were so shrill, that didn't help matters any.I don't know what the musical director of this film was thinking using one tune for the entire movie. Maybe it was for artistic purposes, I don't know, all I know is that I hated it. This could have gone really well because as a I earlier mentioned, the concept was quite amusing, but I can't imagine how anyone can get past the music, the songs, the shrill voices of Anna Kendrick and that kid in the red cloak.",Into the Woods
791,japanesecheeze,You should be familiar with the Musical,7,10 January 2015,"It seems that most people are unfamiliar with the material, which is NOT a Disney story. It is dark and not particularly family friendly. The film is pretty close to the musical, though they do tone down some of the sexual aspects, like the wolf (a metaphor for pedophilia) and the princes' infidelities. If you've seen the musical or are familiar with it, I think you'd enjoy the film. As for people expecting a family-friendly musical, you should look elsewhere, unless you're ready to explain some hard concepts to your kids. This movie is a prime example of why you should look at more than just the previews - other reviewers who think poorly of this film obviously had no idea what it was actually about.OVERALL: Pretty loyal to Sondheim's original version, though they cut the reprise to Agony and the role of the narrator. NOT a kid's movie - parents, do your research next time!",Into the Woods
792,frankenmess,"Horrible, Horrible Movie",2,10 January 2015,"I will admit up front that I don't particularly care for musicals, but that being said I have seen many and even enjoyed a few. First, I feel the score was horrible; it was like they were singing the same song through half the movie. The other half was just as horrible. I found Little Red Riding Hood's voice to be grating and harsh as well as others although not as bad as Ms Crawford's. Every time she sang I wanted to plug my ears. Secondly, the story line was not much better than the score. At the halfway mark I could not believe I still had to endure another hour of this mess. That is two hours I will never get back. I cannot believe this has already won some awards.",Into the Woods
793,kirlia759,"Classic Musical, Good Adaptation and Presence of Good Morals",8,16 January 2015,"Sondheim does an incredible job of intertwining all of these mundane fairy tales in order to create an engaging, contemporary storyline. And, of course, with a beautiful score and brilliant visuals come amazing actors who really capture the essence of their characters. Rob Marshall did a great job in casting, as many of the actors sang very well and in-tune (for those who thought that the songs were made worse by notes sung 'off key', I watched the movie twice, the second time having read the reviews and doing a comparison of the movie to a musical score and script. Everything was quite accurate other than two or three words in a song being spoken rather than sung). Now, many people might not be satisfied with the storyline, but the movie is made for just that. Nothing ends happily ever after. Also, several audiences have pointed out that the thought of Johnny Depp's character to a pedophile-like creature was too inappropriate. Though I will admit that this movie is not for young children, the presence of this predator in the movie, as well as (spoiler) Chris Pine cheating on his princess, has related the film to more typical, real world situations. Now, what I was quite annoyed with is that, unlike the Broadway show, Rapunzel does not die. Because of this, the Witch wasn't able to express her hatred for the dark, cruel world that she only wanted to shield from her daughter. But in the film, Rapunzel's story proves to be the only true happy ending. I was also irritated by the omission of ""No More"", one of the better songs in the musical. However, I was very pleased with the way the plot's themes were introduced. In spite of the many misinterpretations, here are some of the morals present throughout the movie. 1. Children will listen, though they may not obey. So, be careful before you say, ""Listen to me,"" because children will listen. 2. Nice is different than good; someone could have the most evil of intentions but conceal them with charm and charisma. 3. You don't always have to get what you wish for. Wishes come true, not free. 4. Placing the blame should never be the aim; rather, taking action should. 5. If you only think for yourself, you become blind to the future, or those around you. 6. You are not alone; no one is alone. Though it may not be physical, there is always someone at your side. 7. Before making big decisions, it is always best to consider both sides of the argument (also pertaining to the idea that 'no one is alone'.) 8. Happy endings aren't always guaranteed. I highly recommend this film to audiences over the age of 9 or 10. Even though some people have fallen asleep, apparent from the reviews, one should at least stay awake for the second half, as this brings new interpretations of traditional fairy tales and their post-'happy ending'.",Into the Woods

797,bravetoastblanky,Wow! Didn't Expect a Fairy Tale Psychological Masterpiece,10,11 January 2015,"I had never heard of Into the Woods before. Honestly the trailers looked like another Disney cliché kid friendly cash grab. And I had heard of Sondheim, but seeing how I don't really often watch musical theatre this was my first REAL introduction to him and wow.This isn't just run of the mill song and dance showtuney musical songs.These are incredible thought provoking songs. The lyrics are so witty and poignant and driving story and character forward. The song where Cinderella talks herself through her predicament when she's running from the prince was like an incredible Shakespearean monologue, as was Emily Blunt's song in the later part. She has a line I looked up where she says ""If life were made of moments, even now and then a bad one but if life were only moments then you'd never know you had one"" that's genius! Sondheim clearly is deft at writing funny songs too cause ""Agony"" had me crying laughing, me as well as an enormous audience.This is one of those movies that should be brought into colleges and discussed as film artistry. And even discussed from a psychological level! What reviewers on here seemed to have such a problem with is what made such a lasting effect on me with this film. The fairy tale element progressively becomes more real and honest as the film plays on and subverts your expectation of what it is in the beginning. I don't think I've ever seen a film like it. It's genre bending with an enticing unpredictability and heart while being incredibly funny and brilliantly acted and sang by every single person.Hands down best movie I saw this year, certainly Oscar worthy and absolutely the best movie musical I've seen. I walked away from this wanting to learn more of Sondheim's catalogueI wish. I wish Disney would make more films with this level of intelligence, maturity and depth.",Into the Woods

There was a point near the end where the movie should have ended and I might have been able to leave the theater with a better impression of the movie.

Into the Woods is so dull that I could not finish watching it in its entirety, for fear of falling asleep. The star-studded cast falls flat, not because they lack talent, but because the characters are underdeveloped and unlikeable. Little Red Riding Hood is irritating enough to make you want to leave the theater. I have never seen the Sondheim version of the tale, but I really hope that the storyline and characters are better developed than the Disney adaptation.

800,kblashle,bad,2,11 January 2015,After reading some of these reviews it is clear that some people have not read or seen the play. I was weary of this adaptation to begin with when I saw the pg rating. The original show while hilarious and amazing is more on the vulgar side with sex and scandal meant to teach life lessons. Any way you look at this this musical is not meant for young kids more of a teenager adult show. While I thought some of the acting was OK the overall feel was way to rushed as some of the major scenes which make the show make since were left out for some reason. Also the vulgar scenes or scenes that built tension to the plot were left out leaving the viewer confused. Oh well leave it to another great musical butchered by Hollywood.,Into the Woods
801,josh_is_kool92,People who reviewed this badly just don't understand!,10,22 January 2015,"I don't understand people that said this movie was awful... they clearly did not get it. You have to go into this movie with an open mind and knowing it's a musical otherwise u wont enjoy it. Into The Woods is about morals of what is right and wrong, the results of our choices and it's about how things don't always go perfectly in life... unlike, fairy tales. If you don't like musicals you wont like it. And if u expect a Disney happily-ever-after sweet and innocent fairytale this is not for you. It is more darker and is more closely based on the original Grimm brother fairy tales. Although this musical has been toned down somewhat from it's original Broadway story to become more family friendly. The acting in this movie is brilliant and the singing by all actors is excellent! The songs are not super catchy at first listen, but give them a few tries and you will love them. ""Agony"", ""Stay With Me"", ""No One Is Alone"" and ""Children Will Listen"" are the standouts. The sets and special effects are also great.... I liked it enough to go back for a 2nd time!",Into the Woods
802,kerrydeal-dma,Decent representation of the musical... not Disney!,8,12 January 2015,"Overheard after watching the movie: ""I thought it was going to end when Cinderella got married."" Uh oh. It seems people are going into this movie not expecting a Sondheim musical but rather a Disney experience.Reviews seem to fall into two categories, either hating the changes the movie made, or expecting a happy Disney film. I agree more with former group, and offer the following for the latter. (Full disclosure: I teach voice at a large conservatory and know this work quite well.) 1.Objections to the Wolf being a ""pedophile."" Little Red Riding Hood is a symbol for female sexuality. What else is red and has a hood? Don't make me spell it out. One of the themes of this work is loss of innocence, which is demonstrated in her song ""I know things now."" I do think they should have cast her more adolescent than child-like.2. Objections to the ""gross"" stuff like the birds pecking out the eyes, the feet being cut off to fit in the shoe, and Rapunzel's Prince being blinded by thorns. This all comes from the original source material of the fairy tales. Most fairy tales are dark. If you only know the Disney versions, I suggest you read the originals. Spoiler alert: the Mermaid dies.3. Objections to Baker's Wife kissing the Prince. (My own objection being that it was only a kiss in the movie.) This was the invention of Sondheim and Lapine. Sondheim is very interested in exploring people's capacity to not be happy with what they have; again, this is a major theme of this work (the Princes, the Wife, the Witch). I personally find the ""After-Happy Ever After"" part of the brilliance of this work. Sondheim investigates similar themes in shows like Follies, A Little Night Music, Company, and Merrily We Roll Along; it's who he is. Oh, I also object that the woman gets punished with death because she cheated, which is a very operatic construct, but that's another issue.I took my two kids, age 13 and 10, to see it, and they enjoyed it. I previously took the 13 year old to see a live performance at my school when she was 5 or 6. I don't think they are traumatized. I have also taken my kids to Europe. If you are one of those people who thinks you are ""seeing Europe"" at Disney's Epcot, I am guessing this movie is not for you. I personally enjoyed most of the direction, singing, and the visuals of the movie adaptation.",Into the Woods
803,kenziehymas,Quite Excellent!,9,12 January 2015,"OK, I am little confuzzled at the negative reviews this movie has been getting (come on, it's great!). The acting was superb by all of the actors. Johnny Depp's portrayal of the wolf was quite creepy (which is a good thing, since, ya know....wolf). Chris Pine was hilarious. Lilla Crawford was spunky. On top of that, Stephen Sondheim's catchy and wordy songs set the perfect for the mood. The mood....it was awesome. This was a fun movie, yet it was also heartfelt/heartbreaking, thought-provoking, witty, and clever. The second act can tear at your heartstrings. It gave a subtle twist to the fairy tales that we are used to. Seeing these characters interact with each other was golden. The only thing I would complain about is the pace. Various parts/songs have been cut out from the original musical, yet you still wish there was an intermission. Nevertheless, I still deem this a masterpiece, the first good Disney live-action film in a long time.",Into the Woods
804,Heyyitsamber,What just happened?,4,12 January 2015,"*Spoilers! Do not read if you intend on seeing this film!* Wow I expected a decent musical but I was pretty disappointed that I had spent valuable money on this concoction. It was basically a bunch of Grimm fairy tales slapped together in a mixture of singing and hole filled plot. At first, it was somewhat good tho I do admit. The whole baker and witch storyline was exciting and It got me craving for a good fairy tale. I had my hopes a little too high when Johnny Depp was introduced and began singing. (despite his ridiculously cheap costume) though my expectations were too high as he was killed off too quickly and that weird stomach scene made me think twice about the movie. After that everything was pretty basic and alright with a little bad acting (though not a bad cast) as well as that funny prince scene that made me smile a little and kept me from leaving the theatre. But then it got horrid. *MAJOR SPOILERS* So after the female giant came down from the sky I had to keep myself from laughing at the ridiculous plot. It was like they ran out of time to film so they frantically tried to kill off every secondary character or make them disappear. Like Rapunzel. I understand she ran away with her love but where did she go? No epilogue? Or what about Cinderellas Prince? He went to find the giant but the giant was already on her way to jack when he set off to slay it. Where did he go? Don't even get me started on Jacks mother. Did she literally die because that guy pushed her?? That sounds like a death straight out of 1000 ways to die! That can't pull that over your eyes and expect you to accept she was killed by a mere shove! As well I hated how the witch melted it was pretty pathetic for such an outstanding character. This movie should NOT have received such high praise as it did. I honestly thinked it sucked! (The icing on the cake was how the bakers wife died. I didn't even know she fell off the cliff until my friend told me I mean it was horribly blurry and low budget!) I give this movie 4/10 and I do NOT recommend spending money on.",Into the Woods

Then ""Into the Woods"" is the movie for you. Not my cup of tea and due to the fact I was in a group, I stayed because I thought it would be impolite to leave before the end. The monotony was only relieved by the arrival of Chris Pine @ Prince Charming who had a bit of a princely sing-off with Rapunzel's Prince (did he have a name?) which was actually amusing for a couple of minutes. Coincidentally, the name of the song was Agony and that summed up my feelings about this movie. I was in agony. Annoyingly, one of my friends actually went to sleep several times despite the S h r i l l n e s S of some of the ""singing"" (I was so jealous).

It is such a pity, I really like Emily Blunt, Meryl Streep and Jonney Depp but even with 3 of my favourite actors and with a genuinely positive attitude before I went in, I came away really really disappointed. The truth about Sondheim is that he should have let Leonard Bernstien write the music, all the time. He was also rather too cleaver for his own good (he was into writing crossword puzzles and the like I gather). I got entirely lost as to what was supposed to be happening now and then. If a primary school teacher was told to write a play for their class that had to include, such and such songs, and must have parts for every child in the class, they would probably come up with stuff like this!

It felt like I was watching one giant music video, because practically the whole movie was in song. (I love musicals for the record, but this was overkill) They kept it as too much like a theater performance, and not like a movie. All the music is sure to stick in your head whether you want it to or not, that I guaranty. However, the MOST APPALLING thing about this production was that it was rated PG. THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!! It is an adult film, it contains far too many immoral things. The worst was from Johnny Deeps performance of the Wolf, and when Cinderella's stepmother cut off parts of her own daughters feet to make the slipper fit, and there were many other things that were loosely veiled metaphors that do not belong in any shows designed for children.

The performances - The cast was very promising, but the performances were mediocre at best, even Meryl Streep couldn't save this film. Jonny Depp, for the brief time he was in the film was one of the stand out performers which says everything you need to know. James Corden was decent but the fact he narrated as well took something away from the overall atmosphere. The music - Once you'd heard one song you heard them all.

I don't get the negatives - get into the parody - the two princes on the waterfall was paramount - I don't really know anything like it anywhere (ok, maybe Neo, Trinity and Morpheus breaking in to see the Merovingian...).I was not expecting a musical - but it was a very fun musical - because none of it was serious - or expected to be taken seriously - but the professionalism was accomplishing just that most of the time.The young Jack was a great guy but did not have the voice that the others did (not that we had Robert Halford et al at bat but certainly close enough). Of course Johnny Depp played the wolf - I knew that as soon as I realized there was a wolf but before he was shown on screen!!",Into the Woods

I was shocked that Meryl Streep was in something like this!I'm gutted that I didn't actually walk out of the cinema.

816,joelspicer2001,What have i watched,1,17 January 2015,"oh my good god this film is absolute madness I have never seen anything like it, for starters I saw the trailer and it looked good (in the trailer it didn't say it was a musical) I was really excited to see this film, so the first bit started and lots of people were singing so I thought that they only sang for the first bit but NO! it went on and on and on and on I have never seen anything like it, and I don't have a clue how this film is a PG because for start Johnny Depp was in it and I was excited for that but he was only in it for 5 minutes and they were the most terrifying 5 minutes of my life he was looking at red riding hood in a very disturbing way and when he was singing that song that was really weird to sum him up he was a pedophile cannibal.Also the film was extremely boring due to all the singing and not understanding it this was because there was way too much going on in each scene.over all this film was Crap with a capital C do not waste your money and time watching this. Shame on you Disney!!!!",Into the Woods
817,melgibwal,Lost the essence of the musical,4,18 January 2015,"I shall start off by saying I am a huge fan of the musical on stage. It is clever and witty and thought provoking with fabulous songs. The movie adaptation lost a lot of this and it ended up being a mediocre mess. Thinking about it I believe is the loss of lot of the linking songs and certainly a major mistake was to cut the song that ends Act 1 and the prologue that begins Act 2 which set the scene for everything that follows. Without these the final 45 mins or so of the movie become a tedious add on.To my mind a movie adaptation should bring something extra to a stage musical, something that cannot be seen on stage but can only be implied, for example a grand scene depicting the Ball that Cinderella attends. Without this perhaps a filmed version of a stage production would have more value, something my non-musical going partner pointed out.I also had a problem with the casting age of Red Riding Hood and Jack. With older teenagers playing the roles their songs become analogies for the sexual awakening of young adults, played by 12 year olds (?) the implications are distasteful. This is not a children's movie and being produced by Disney is inappropriate. There were children in the cinema who were clearly too young for the adult themes. It's is a great missed opportunity to take a wonderful show to another level and I can only assume that the producers did not trust their audiences enough to cope with the subtle nuances of the original. Shame.",Into the Woods
818,yanikaflynn,Let me sum it up for you... *MAJOR SPOILERS*,1,18 January 2015,"Let me sum it all up for you;Opening scene sets the stage for every one needing to go into the woods - this is repeated about twenty times until they finally go into the woods. You may not know going in but it's a musical - every sentence is sung. And I love a good musical - this gets old reeeeally quickly. Within the first scene of the witch she is singing about the bakers dad stealing & ""raping"" her gardenJacks mother repeatedly hits him & tells him he's an idiot childFirst major scene of the wolf & the"" little girl"" /red riding hood is a scene that is both disturbing & cringe worthy leaving everyone in the cinema feeling uneasy & sick. As he sings to her about wanting to eat her ""plump & pink limbs"" and can't wait to have her grandma too all the time you feel this has become the national anthem for pedophiles everywhere The baker then attacks the little girl to strip her coat off her before she lets out & blood curdling scream and he gives it backoh by the way Rapunzel is the bakers sister but that's all you ever hear about that and they never meet Cinderella runs away from the prince three times and he keeps hunting her downThere's a homo erotic scene between the two princes singing about their objects of desire /the princess' probably the best part of the film (kind of not really)The wolf eats the little girl but then the baker cuts the wolf open to get them out to which another horrible song is sung about how she felt ""excited"" about how the wolf devoured her leaning heavily towards the same uneasy feeling of a girl describing her first sexual experience ""scared but excited""Oh also the cow dies but gets risen from the dead but then the humans feed it shoes, clothes & hair That hair is Rapunzel's by the way which the bakers wife literally pulls off (almost a scalping scene but thankfully Disney toned that down)There's a song in which jack sings of giant women holding him to her ""giant breast"" then it gets even more disturbing with the prince getting blinded by thorns Repunzels hair is brutally cut by the witch after she sings to her that she cant be trusted & that the world is a horrible place But it's OK cos her tears fix his scars & blindness and they ride off on a horse never to be seen again Then there's Cinderella's slipper - and of course the trying on of the slipper between the ugly step sisters And I know I know you think you know how this bit goes but you don't. The step mum again quite graphically (sounds and all) cuts the toes off her first daughter ""you don't need to walk when you're a princess!"" Then the cuts the heel off her other daughter who literally faints when she tries to walk in the shoeThen Cinderella sends her bird friends to stab out their eyes as revenge The witch drinks some milk & turns into a ""pretty"" witch again and the bakers wife has an emasculate conception in front of your eyesOh & Jack kills a giant 👍Finally you think it's almost over - Cinderella is happily married there's the happily ever after ending scene where they're all waving at each other & happy Joy oh joy this horrible nightmare is over!!No. It's not.45 mins later you are left with the remains of even more heinous story telling There's a giant wanting to kill jack and it's apparently EVERYONES fault (there's an anxiety giving song about that too!) The prince meets the bakers wife in the woods literally says""your brave - can I kiss you"" and they make out and have sex on a treeHe leaves - she sings about her want to continue to cheat on her husband And then falls off a cliff and apparently dies So does jacks mother but she get pushed to the ground by some guy ""she didn't make it""The witch sings I'm sick of this and turns to mud Then it's suddenly a bible story about David & Goliath (jack kills the giant woman with a sling shot to the head) And when you think yes it's almost over the baker decides to adopt all the left over kids & tell them about the story that we had just witnessed as that horrible song starts again & you just want to cry & run out of the cinema and demand your money back, tell every parent DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO THIS!!!

Meryl Streep is astounding. I hadn't seen her do this in many years, and she IS the living treasure we all thought she was. Emily Blunt surprises too, in every frame with her remarkable and subtle choices. Stephen Sondheim's music and lyrics are presented with the full effect of their brilliance.

820,Asimonyan2014,Don't WATCH,1,18 January 2015,SPOILERS WARNING SPOILERS Okay so I walked out of the movie theater thinking wt to myself. First of all now realizing this was NOT a PG movie or a Disney movie what so ever. Wolf trying to eat little red ridding hood or a rapist seducing a little girl? The scene in the woods with the bakers wife and the prince was WAY too much for kids and so was Rapunzel and her prince. And Cinderellas sisters feet getting cut and then them getting blind was a little to much. Honestly they were pretty disturbing scenes. The singing was WAY to much for me I didn't expect it to be that much I would say 70% of the time it was singing rather than talking. Very repetitive we get the freaking point the same line was repeated 15 times over and over again. The point where you think everything is okay is when things get bad and you just completely getting your mind screwed what were these people thinking? So the prince spent all this time trying to find his Cinderella and Cinderella spent all that time trying to get to the festival when they end up screwing each other over?! And throwing pebbles at a huge giant and the giant dieing where is the common scene? What was the point of Rapunzel in this movie? And so the bakers wife was a cheater and a fake but and he never finds out?! And why did EVERYONE die in the end? Was that really needed? There are more things wrong with this movie but I could go on forever.,Into the Woods

I just don't understand how this movie is nominated for any awards. There was little bit of humor however, the movie was just too long. If you like musical, then go see Annie.

Is something wrong with Disney's staffs? Are they gone crazy? It didn't seem like a low budget movie, or maybe it was. All of the musical songs were horrible. Twisted story line bothered me so much, I almost felt like I was insulted, I wished I could have gone back to the time I was about to swipe my credit card at the box. No sense at all from beginning to the end. I wanted my money back for the first time.

824,lyubozar79,Refreshing and Amusing,8,21 January 2015,"I went to the theater attracted by the cast and the visual style of the trailer. I didn't expect it to be a musical - but it turned out a nice surprise. Maybe I'd wish music were more varied in theme and tempo, and some songs - shorter, yet it managed to create a fairy tale atmosphere and blended well with the plot and the characters. Singing was good, indeed.So, 5 minutes after the movie started - I was already surprised, amused and delighted to find myself in the beginning of a unique experience. It was immediately clear this was not going to be the next superficial classics remake that sells nicely polished and easy to swallow clichés. It was not going to be a movie for kids, either! (I guess most of all these negative reviews are based on parents' nightmarish experience - witnessing the terror of their kids watching their favorite fairy tale pals disintegrate into other complex and evolving characters, burdened with real-feel, real-world problems. Dear parents, this is not the Sunday-afternoon-family- movie to take your kids to!)Certainly, there is some substance in those criticism aimed at the fluency of the script and the plot evolution. Though, at the same time - I find this movie's patchwork structure with the numerous surprise-swings quite refreshing. There is also this characteristic sense of humor that adds the feeling of lightheartedness and sets the movie free of the classics frame. Some of the characters - like Rapunzel, and regretfully - the Lady Giant - feel less convincing and the movie would have benefited greatly if they were dealt with more care. Still, the Witch and the Little Red Riding Hood perform brilliantly.At the end, I left the theater quite refreshed, feeling challenged with an experience quite different than expected, with a big smile on my face :)",Into the Woods

There was NO indication in the trailer that this was a musical. The story was awful, the songs were worse and the singing was even more horrendous. I went with my 3 children (10, 12 & 14) and they hated it. My son's quote ""I tried to sleep but the awful singing kept waking me up"". And it kept going on and on an on. I thought that a movie with Jonny Depp in couldn't be so bad. I wasn't sure whether it was trying to be a parody of fairy tale movies (which The Princess Bride achieved stunningly) or whether it was just plain awful in the way that daytime soapies are.

I find it hard to believe that they could have thought it was any good. My take on this is that the studio probably spent too much money on the production, found out from the test audience that it was genuine poop and decided to bribe as many people as they could to get this picture 'liked'by the critics.

The movie just plain sucks. That's all there is to it. I was dragged into this movie not knowing what to expect by my cousin and to be completely honest I was open minded, but I wanted to walk out right when the singing started. The story didn't make sense and you'd think that at least the singing and acting would be good. Nope. Truth of the matter is, Jack Sparrow plays a pedo-wolf stalking a ""delicious, juicy little girl"" and towards the end, which made absolutely no sense, the baker's wife and prince cheat on each others spouse/husband for no known reason. Which I found to be unnecessary and random. Not to mention the poorly made CGI giant lady who gets killed by a pebble slung from some little twerp. I could go on and on. Probably the worst film I was ever forced to see. I'd rather watch Dora the Explorer on a loop than this crap again.

The princes not good enough,disappointing. How realistic though, for the Cinderella part, totally bursts the bubble of any fairy tales. And the baker's wife is hotter than Cinderella. But kissing the prices? Outrageous. Overall it is all good except for the songs. The pitch and repetition give you headache. Yes, I like the witch.

Disney must be paying people to give it 10/10 to counteract the real people giving 1/10!If id taken my kids to see this I would be hammering Disney with emails of complaint and demanding an apology. Firstly the trailer is deceptive as it doesn't make it clear its a musical. And it is singing 95% of the time, it just goes on and on and on... And I swear to god it was the same damn song over and over, just some generic song that's totally unmemorable. How is that even possible?!The worst thing is the lack of morals, truly unbelievable, and from Disney! I kept thinking wtf is going on?!The wolf is clearly a paedo and made my skin crawl, what were they thinking?! Cinderella rather than being the lovely (insipid) girl she seems to be decides to get birds to peck her stepsisters eyes out. The prince tries to rape the bakers wife. The bakers wife falls to her death leaving a newborn baby behind. Rape is mentioned in a song near the beginning, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The young princes are only interested in shagging the princesses ""I've got to have her"" they keep singing. Jacks mum dies completely randomly even though I'm sure it wasn't clear what happened to her.Yes there is some good acting in here, Meryl Streep was amazing, the bakers wife was good, James was alright, Jonny was in it for 3 minutes.

Before you see it esp with kids do your research into its background and make an informed choice.Some keep slating it because it is attached to Disney but it is true to the stage musical which wasn't written by Disney! The way in which the musical is written in terms of story lines of Cinderella (and step family), Red Riding Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk are very true to the original brothers Grimm stories so if you do not like the at times gory aspects (the gore is implied, not seen at all and is for comedic effect)such as spoiler alert-the step sisters come-uppance then don't go to see it. It isn't a Disney take on fairy tales it is true to the original stories, I am a massive Disney fan but Disney have sugar coated the original stories within their animations when in fact the true tales are very dark. Spoiler alert-in addition to this people keep going on about Rapunzel's tears healing her Prince-this once again happens in the original brothers Grimm tale, as does the pitch left on the stairs by the prince to stop Cinderella escaping the Ball for the third time running-read up on your fairy tales people!The songs and singing ability of the cast has come under scrutiny but I haven't been able to get them out of my head-they are gorgeous and integral to the story telling-no one bursts out singing randomly it makes sense when they sing and what they sing about.People don't seem to understand act 2 and want it to have a happy ending like at the end of Act 1-the point this musical is making is to be careful what you wish for and that once you get what you wish for you aren't always as happy as you think you will be; are you certain what you wish is what you want? Its about the 2 dimensional fairytale characters we are familiar with becoming real people and the song No One Is Alone is stunning. Yes this may not be suitable for the very young but it is showing all of us that even the 'perfect princess' has flaws and insecurities and that its OK for them to have flaws. Spoiler alert-with regards to the Bakers Wife and Prince kiss again this is life-affairs happen! I don't get why everyone is outraged by this! I do however agree that the Wolf scene is strange and uncomfortable which is a shame as Red Riding Hood is very well cast and plays an excellent part.Don't let the poor reviews put you off, ultimately everyone has different preferences and opinions and not everyone is going to like it but I am one of the ones who loves it and I wanted to share my thoughts; I found it humorous, emotional and inspiring.",Into the Woods

This musical shows that life is not always a fairytale, bad things do happen and ""people make mistakes"". What is important is to remember that ""no one is alone"". This musical teaches children to be careful what they wish for and that ""nice is different than good"".Johnny Depp's character is supposed to be slightly sleazy and predatory, but surely it is a good message to teach that not everyone can be trusted?The music is perfectly placed throughout the musical, and though the film has many differences, you can still understand the story if you actually listen to what the characters are saying.Fantastic film.

832,ilovemyblackshoes,"Kids, don't go into the woods",2,24 January 2015,"I don't know where to start. This film is not suitable for kids: they'll be bored and confused. At the cinema, one grandfather sitting next to me told her granddaughter after the film ended: 'Well, if you behave badly I'll bring you to see it again'. That's harsh punishment.Apart from this, I, as an adult, was bored and irritated. Not one single character could decide where to go. This ambiguity (are you bad? are you good? are you implying a legally punishable behaviour?) and the nonexistent plot was like watching an insane person digressing. (I feel the kid friendly adaptation is to blame for this, but I'll say when I watch the play) I felt like the songs could be reduced to one. The lyrics changed, but not the melody. It reminded me of a six year old singing a teasing tune. Also, the only colours you'll see is black and grayish blue. The acting was decent, considering the characters where flat and explainable by one adjective.Actually, I was excited to see the film and my reaction after went to the complete opposite. After reading my review, you'll probably think more positively if you see the movie. I've seen it happen, the leveling of the common impression. But don't feel bad for not liking it, not even for the princesses.

835,nedriley89,"Definitely worth watching for the fans, and others may like it too",9,26 January 2015,"Before I begin, let me get something out of the way. Many of the negative reviews I've seen here tend to be from those who...a) Saw it was a PG-rated Disney fairytale, and assumed it was a kids' movie b) Came in with no idea that it was a musicalIf you fall under category A, this is not the first time Disney has done a movie with more adult/mature themes and still only got a PG rating at most. For instance, when I was a kid, I thought the movie Tron was boring, and really it's only as an adult that I get a lot of the more subtle nuances. Let's not also forget stuff like Watcher in the Woods, Hunchback of Notre Dame, or even Pinocchio...If you fall under category B, I'll say this much - if you're not into musicals, fine. But remember that there is a big difference between a bad movie and a film that doesn't appeal to your tastes. I myself admittedly don't care for the Shawshank Redemption, which, as of this posting, is number one on IMDb's top 250. It's not that I think it's a bad movie, it's just that period dramas about prison life don't really interest me all that much.It's not always their job to tell you what you're in for. Sometimes, it pays to do some research before seeing a movie, about what it is. And with all that said, I will give my two cents on this film...Into the Woods is probably the only stage musical I've ever really gotten into, having listened to a recording of the 1990 London cast, watched a production with the original Broadway cast, as well as bearing witness to a high school production that my dad helped put on. When it was announced that Disney was doing a film version, I was cautiously optimistic, excited and scared, you might say. I was worried that it would either be watered down, or too serious for its own good like a lot of recent ""adult"" fairytale movies of the last ten years (Snow White and the Huntsman, Maleficent, Red Riding Hood, Brothers Grimm).So, when I did see it, it very much exceeded my expectations. All the actors, even the minor ones, did very well in their roles. Even casting children in the roles of Jack and Red Riding Hood, which I thought would potentially be a failing of the film, turned out to be a nuance that worked in its favour.The style and look of the film was also a huge plus. I think it's best described as a mixture of the animated Disney fairytale, Stardust, and Pan's Labyrinth. It does have lighthearted and comedic elements that don't feel out of place, but there's also a dark undercurrent. In addition, the movie really takes advantage of the fact that it can get away with a lot more in the visual department.The music is excellent, though, again, I was already familiar with the songs to begin with. But man, the orchestrations give them real grandeur, and many of the actors surprised me with their vocal talents - I didn't know Emily Blunt or Chris Pine could sing, and I never pegged Anna Kendrick as the one to pull off Cinderella's soprano, but she nailed it. What's more, the songs seem to fit the visuals, since the musical genre and the fantasy genre tend to go together like peanut butter and chocolate.If I did have an issue with it, it would probably be the transition from Act 1 to Act 2. In the stage version, the fairytale characters all have their happily ever after, then there's an intermission, then act 2 takes place sometime later, and opens with the characters reflecting on their happy endings, before the Giant's wife comes down the beanstalk to seek revenge on Jack. In the movie, it's pretty abrupt and interrupts a happy moment. However, the movie picks itself back up a little bit after the clunky transition. Some might say the movie should have ended with the characters' initial happily ever after, but the original play is a bit of a deconstruction of the fairytale, and shows that morality is not always black and white.In the end, Into the Woods is a very good film, and makes a case for the revisionist fairytale, as well as the film musical. If you're a fan of the original show, definitely check this out. For those who aren't familiar, but enjoy a good musical, you might like this.",Into the Woods

The reality, the unfortunate and unsettling reality, is that the film fails to deliver..I would strongly advise parents not to take their young children to see this movie- seeing the evil stepmother cut off her daughter's toe so that the shoe fits isn't very pleasant.But Disney, the epitome of positivity and gaiety, simple cannot do justice while mimicking such dark undertones.",Into the Woods

The storyline was non existent, the songs (I use that term of phrase very loosely) had the same melody consistently, they just dragged on and on and on! The sigh of relief when the happy ending appeared signalling, or so I thought, the finish to this lengthy film but oh no! low and behold it carried on. I eventually gave up and ended up walking out along with several others. Not only was the film itself boring but the atmosphere in theatre was dull and lifeless as no one else was enjoying this supposed hit!

What I expect to see from a film supposedly for children is an up building item that will add to their appearance of the world. This film, Into the Woods, comes across as a rather nasty attempt to change basic ideals of right and wrong, excuse malfeasance, excuse all known moral rectitude and put a new set of very poor values in front of children as something which is a ""new norm"".Singing and acting are poor at best and Meryl Streep should have known better than turn out for this sort of rubbish.Bottom line............Don't waste your money.

Its a shame as i cannot understand this sort of thing from high end film makers. I lost interest early on, but still gave it a go. It didn't get any better. This film is a little like, it was someones good idea for a very short story, that they had two weeks to make it into a film with an unlimited budget.

At least, I would expect Disney can make the story line more interesting, with more clarity, rather than mixed with a confusing moral standard. My teen daughter is a huge Disney fan but left confused. She said, this was the first Disney movie that didn't ""wow"" her. Well, talking about the real world, maybe this is the one, Disney does not always make the amazing movie!!?? The story line is just too much mess, dragged too long, the forest is too dark and boring, and I was falling asleep in final 1/3. What on earth the prince kisses the baker's wife?

The good side to the millions of dollars rolling in from 'Frozen': Disney taking risks on an even more unusual musical adventure. Our broad range of ages, five years old and upwards, all enjoyed this thoroughly. It's ironic and mischievous and the music is glorious.

Brilliant Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep. We all fell for the two bombastic Princes, undoing machismo to a tee.

I realized visually and the performances were great but The overlaying of lyrics was distracting and unsettling to me within the first 15 minutes. (I had heard it was a musical but this was operatic and not to my taste) And then songs later would have such an intense patter to them I couldn't keep up with and ultimately I just started feeling alienated from the movie. At a certain point there is this bizarre dark tonal shift for the last third after you think it ends and by then my brain and patience had just thrown in the towel and I wanted out. I was ready to write it off as a movie I would never want to see again. Until all of my friends wanted to see it and I held my tongue and went again and well...I had a completely different experience. For one, this time I realized the patter songs fit the characters and their dilemmas. Cinderella had a song that during my first viewing I thought ""Why can't she just sing a pretty simple melody"" but seeing it the second time I noticed Cinderella in this version is much more complex and neurotic and her song felt human and relatable. All of the songs to me suddenly seemed that way. Wheras ""Let it Go"" is a song that could really be sung by anybody, this music was written specifically for the characters and I just had to marvel at the deftness of that. And as for the darker last half, knowing it was coming now made me feel braced to try to understand ""Why does this story take this turn?"" I realized Into the Woods is not a wacky fairy tale that just loses its way, it brilliantly lulls the viewer to a false sense of security and gets pointed and asks the audience to delve deeper showing action and consequence, There isn't always a black and white solution (a chilling line in the film, a character says ""a giant is a person. Aren't we to show forgiveness?) and that happily ever after is something you can't realistically strive for.Even though I've read the source material is older this film feels ahead of its time in some way. It asked the Disney movie going audience to not escape into summer movie fantasy entertainment but instead point an arrow back at themselves; look at their lives and parenting. It is a masterful film that deserves that second chance I never would have given it to reap the richness that you can't obtain from a first viewing. I hope in time I'm not the only one who realizes there is so much more here and this is embraced as a once misunderstood classic.",Into the Woods
851,edmonstoneg,It was brilliant!,10,18 February 2015,"I thought this movie was amazing and I was so shocked when I saw pages and pages of 1-star reviews! I loved it, my friends and siblings loved it! And at the end a lot of people in our cinema started clapping!! So I was really surprised at all the hate it has received. I have never watched the original state production and I didn't really know what to expect when I walked in (I had watched the trailer and knew it was a musical) but as soon as it started i loved it!!Firstly I loved the storyline. I loved the idea of all the fairy tales being intertwined! I also thought it was very well put together with the original plot line of the Baker and his Wife. The happily ever after in the middle of the story really interested me and I really liked it because it is so realistic! Not everyone has a happy ending and I like how we got to find out what happened to our fairytale characters after happily ever after.I loved the songs!! Although they might not have been the catchiest songs ever I really liked them. Agony was hilarious thought my favourite song would have to be No one is Alone. I might be a bit biased towards liking this movie though as I'm a huge sucker for musicals ;) Anyway I thought the singing was amazing! I thought the best singer was Anna Kendrick as Cinerella, closely followed by Emily Blunt but they were all brilliant! I also thought the acting was brilliant and the best acting in my opinion was from Emily Blunt and James Corden. Musicals are not for everyone though... So I expected some people wouldn't like it. Though if you don't like musicals, don't watch them!A lot of people say that this film is not suitable for children and that's why the didn't like it but I disagree, my eight year-old sister came with me to watch it and she loved it! She didn't find it not suitable at all! There is some violence but not much and some hints of pedophilia but I don't think young children will get those hints. I myself am only 13 years old.Overall this was a brilliant movie with great acting and singing and a brilliant plot line! I loved every minute of it! It's quite funny (the lady next to me in the cinema couldn't stop laughing at some points, it was actually quite annoying really...) there's romance and action. And I loved it!",Into the Woods

I am quite surprised because I think many members of the audience felt the same way. About half an hour before the movie ended, many people in the theatre started complaining loudly about the movie and other people walked out. I would have thought that if this movie had gone through a viewing before release this should have been evident.

853,kamo-twitterpated,I am not sure where all the hate is coming from...,8,22 February 2015,"Possible spoilers ahead - It has been about a year since I last watched the play Into the Woods, so perhaps I am forgetting something but I don't understand the negativity towards this movie. I feel like the negatives can be (mostly) divided into the following categories:-Those who had no idea what they were going to be watching- This reminds me of Les Mis when it came out. How many people did not know going into that movie on their date night that EVERY. SINGLE. LINE. was going to actually be sung out? This is a musical play. I have seen many complaints as to the lyrics being provincial or underdeveloped. As someone who has seen this play many times, I can't disagree more. This was never an overly refined script to begin with. But it was humorous and entertaining and provided a spin on the stereotypical fairy tale that has not been done before or since. -Those who loved the play and expected this to be JUST LIKE it- Can anyone please point me in the direction where a movie has been made and kept perfectly to the source material? For those out there who have seen this play and are disappointed with the movie adaptation, I can only disagree. I was impressed with the talent of the actors involved. Their mannerisms and delivery reminded me VERY much of the original cast of the play. The one I was the most nervous about was Jack and he performed ""Giants in the Sky"" beautifully, even if he could not do the song the way the more adult stage performer had done it. The Baker was the only one I was not highly impressed with, but I honestly didn't care for him in the play either so that's that. The things they left out of this adaptation were not really parts that meant a whole lot to me and did not take away from the overall story arch...Although I would've loved to have heard the second ""Agony"" in Act ll.For those of you who just think the story sucks -Well, part of me agrees with you. This play makes the point that you should be careful what you wish for. That happy endings are not what life will sometimes give you. In fact, the movie (and play) could very well have ended after the first act and everyone could be in a good mood from another feel good movie. I still debate on that myself, but that is not the point of the play and the film got this right. The ending will most likely leave those not in the know a little unsatisfied and maybe even a little sad. But even with all that, I recommend this movie.",Into the Woods

The shallow lyrics signifies nothing, and the plot unfolds itself in a sloppy way. The characters are flat and their supposed development through the story is embarrassingly disgusting.

Everyone is upset by the films ""adult material"" and ""underlying sexual content"" but Pirates of the Caribbean is a Disney film and its content is much, much darker. Into the Woods is an amazing adaptation of a Broadway Musical and parents need to understand that.

I had only seen a few previews on TV for it, so I didn't realize until I got to the theater that it actually was a musical. I think what I liked most about it was the unexpectedness and unpredictability of the characters and the situations they were in. It definitely didn't follow a typical fairy tale story line, and instead was more of a representation of what classic fairy tales would be like in real life. The interconnectedness of the characters and plot really brought the film to life, and the songs only added to the film.

This movie was pretty close to to recreating the feelings you're supposed to get from the original stories. I agree that maybe they should've put a higher rating on this movie but if you think Disney made all of this up, then you are sorrily mistaken.

Walt Disney would fire every person associated with this movie. What the heck is wrong with Hollywood. I was actually upset when I left the movie theater. Let me see, I think we can take the hero's and make them into adulterers!!! Very intelligent Disney. I rate this as the worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen some that were atrocious. I had to take a shower after being assaulted by Disney. To add too the stupidity, the ""singing"" (more appropriately ranting) ALL was sung to the same very strange beat (not music) and sometimes would not end. At one point I leaned over to my wife and said I might have to commit suicide, joking of course. This was I believe to be some philosophical look at the ""human"" condition in life and the obstacles we supposedly encounter, there in lies, ""Into The Woods"".

I thought each character generally have their own melody in musicals/musical based films. However in this film, there was just one main melody. Each character just repeat that same melody throughout, from the prologue song to later ones.2. whether it is OK to combine two types of singing together? I remember one song where the little red riding hood and Jack are singing to each other. I recognised Jack's voice from Les Mis, I also like the little red riding hood's voice, she's probably a really good musical singer too. But Jack sings in a very West End style and little red riding hood sings in a very Broadway style...it was a nice song but the combination just didn't work for me...did it work for anyone else?3. I really didn't like the plain and high pitch singing style of Cinderella...there was one song where the baker's wife was asking about the prince after Cinderella just got out of the castle...omg...that was a horrible song for me...will write more when I have more time...",Into the Woods

863,JackItOut,Different Disney Approach,7,14 March 2015,"* No spoilers in this post, because who want's spoilers anyway! *I really don't get the bad reviews on the film. It's a good movie - definitely not the best Disney movie but still a have to see movie! First of all, i got to admit that i'm a huge Disney fan, but I still hope that my review is objective enough: I think with the movie Disney is trying to do something new - and it didn't quite work out as expected. It's not a movie for the whole family with a ""Happy Ending"", like we all are used to know from Disney movies. The movie tries to be a more realistic way to tell the story about the old fairy tales we all learned to love in our childhood. But it tries to hard to differ from the tales, that it just puts way too much adult/sexual references in the movie.When the movie reaches it's usual (everyone is happy) ending it has just reached its half time. After that, there comes the new part where the movie changes every fairy tale mentioned in the movie (Little Red, Jack and the Beanstalk, Rapunzel and Cinderella). And the reason for that just seems to be: We got to do something new! In all fairness I have to say that the acting, the costumes and the singing parts are really very good. The whole movies is a lot of fun and entertaining! The only thing I'm trying to say/criticizes is that Disney is trying to hard to reach a more adult audience with this movie. I don't need the sexual references to justify that I'm an adult watching a Disney movie. I like Diseny movies and that's okay - no need to change the perfect happily ever after movies! Maybe it's not too bad to stick to where you're good at.So give it a try! It's a good movie, a great musical and yet again a good moral lesson from Disney. And we all know, that we're never to old to learn.Btw. exceptional work by Anna Kendrick (acting/singing) and for her information: I'm 23 male and a handsome single.

But on to the highlights and misses... The film played out beautifully with blending CGI to enhance that magical world of the woods. Things, such as the cow and the witch's entrances/exits, were transformed into beautiful reality. Much of the cast was flawlessly chosen, especially Cinderella, the Wolf, and the Baker & his Wife. Streep's vocals are exquisite! Yet a lot of the comedic aspect was lost, most notably Rapunzel's character. The time lapse between acts was shortened. In the play, as expressed in the 2nd ""Agony"" (left out of the movie), she has well gone off her rocker in a hilariously delivered form. The film simply has her ride off with her prince, and then she's forgotten... No wandering the woods screaming randomly, after years of being a tower shut in have left her loony bin worthy. Oh, but that was the character at her funny finest! And while Streep has the pipes, she forgot the grand, blunt sarcasm that made Peters' performance so enjoyable. So when she did deliver a line like ""I was only trying to be a good mother"" is seemed out of place. All in all it was enjoyable though. Those who whine about the inappropriateness of the Wolf, or the Stepsisters trying on the shoe, clearly have no idea what the original play was like. Hey, at least Johnny Depp didn't don a large, furry prosthetic penis!!! Now THAT would have made for some really funny parent reviews...",Into the Woods

Instead he was just a really creepy guy singing awful lyrics and touching a little girl in all the wrong ways. Gross! While there was some humorous parts of the movie, they were not enough to make the movie the least bit enjoyable. It should have ended when the peasant married the prince, and the baker and his wife had the baby. The movie was already bad at that point, and really just took an even harder turn for the worse.

The first act is mediocre. However, the second act is absolutely dreadful. The writers simply scribbled on a sheet of paper in puke green crayon and then called that a story. It appears that nobody looked at it, either, to determine if it was ready to be used. They obviously were trying to make the film dramatic, but there are much better ways of doing this than having one of the lead characters cheat on her husband, before killing off nearly ALL of your characters. The special effects are abysmal, and are almost nonexistent. The only redeeming factor is Meryl Streep's acting.

I too was unaware the thing was a musical however, I would normally give a movie one chance at redemption, maybe another 15 minutes. This movie however, I walked in, I walked out in under a minute. Why? Can't say other than, it's like meeting someone for the first time and you immediately dislike them, they don't even have to open their mouths, you just don't like 'em.

My favorite character was Little Red Riding Hood (see my user name) played by Lilla Crawford because she was brave and outgoing, and not afraid to stick up for her friends, even if it meant getting herself in trouble. Cinderella was also great because she didn't want to make the wrong decision with the prince, or with anything. That's why she kind of reminded me of me.

It should have just ended after Cinderella and the prince got married. Everything got confusing after that. When the prince started kissing the baker's wife, I had no idea what was going on. Did he just suddenly forget that he married someone not even hours before? I would probably give this a higher rating when it ended when the prince got married and everyone was happy. And why did the baker and his wife leave their baby alone with a little girl? Any bad thing could have happen. This is the only Disney movie (plus Frozen) that I disliked.

875,josephlampe-40248,Overall Decent,7,1 April 2015,"Overall, I'm fairly pleased with how this came out. Rob Marshal being presented with the difficult task of taking ""Into the Woods"" on screen, Id say he did a pretty good job.The strong point for acting in the movie has to be Meryl Streep (Witch). Her performance really did deserve an Oscar nomination. The weaker side of acting for me is a tie between Anna Kendrick (Cinderella) and Daniel Huttlestone (Jack). Some points they both looked like they were just reciting lines.I am however GREATLY disappointed in the fact that this movie was made under the Disney logo. They had to change so many things to make it more ""kid-friendly"" and I was just discouraged. A couple of examples are when Rapunzel rides off with the prince instead of getting crushed by the giant, when the bakers wife falls off of the cliff instead of being crushed by the giant, and when the Steward accidentally kills Jacks mother instead of hitting her on the head with his staff. I feel some of these adaptations took away some of, if not most of the allegory behind the show. And if the Mysterious Man was as big as he was on stage, I think it might have helped other people follow the story better.But don't get me wrong! Its a fantastic story accompanied with a beautiful score written by Sondheim. Some of the allegory is left in the movie. You may have to see it more than once to find it, but its there. 7/10",Into the Woods

I doubt I will see the end of the movie.I like musical movies. But most of them have a team of writers and composers behind them; I'm thinking of classics like Mary Poppins or even Johnny's earlier venture into the genre: Sweeney Todd, which I found quite brilliant. This thing here is the total opposite of Sweeney Todd. The music sounds uninspired, stereotypical. I would not be surprised if this was a first attempt at 100% Artificial Intelligence composed music and lyrics.Speaking of which, perhaps the actors are also not as real as Disney likes us to believe. I would not even lift an eyebrow if they would turn out to be exquisite computer animations. This film also makes me wonder: Has Johnny Depp gone overdue, accepting roles like this, in scripts like this? Does he need the money or something?As you see now, a lot of thoughts come up, none of them actually about the movie itself. In one line, it is a mess of fairy tales, bad acting, irritating lyrics and a horrible storyline.As a father I can only say to all the mothers and fathers out there: By all means, put this movie on when you want a quiet evening to read your book while your kids watch telly.But if you want to see a proper movie, this is not it.",Into the Woods

From a purely technical standpoint, the character development was awful, I can't understand how the story was ever sold on the plot in the first place, and the lyrics to the songs?? Are you seriously the same corporation that Walt Disney founded? Red singing about a loss of innocence, a very sexual and perverted Mr. Wolf, a pointless Giantess and her slaying (seriously, what was the plot tie in?!!), infidelity and the climactic ending song...""be careful what you wish for, wishes are like children, you might just get what you wish for..."" Did any above the line producer even read this script? From an entertainment standpoint, this movie is garbage. The storyline is not appropriate for the Disney audiences it was marketed to, much less children period. The lack of morals and the incongruity of the stories theme and plot is lost on me as to why this was picked up by Disney. The slippery slope of Disney's moral compass has turned into a sheer cliff of ice with this and the continuity of daytime programming that celebrates the off-color humor and anti-family values that dominate.

Just because the name Disney is on the cover and every where else does not mean its a movie for children. Any ways the reason I really enjoyed this movie is because its not loaded with bull crap to make you feel happy. If you wanna whine about how the movie is do your RESEARCH. The book was to teach housewives and children hence the original title: Kinder- und Hausmarchen. All Disney movies are actually gruesome stories. Real life isn't about being put under a spell for eternal sleep until a handsome prince comes by to kiss you and your magically awake ""happy ever after"".

885,kugarand-35838,You are all ignorant,10,3 May 2015,"Everyone who is complaining about this musical is completely ignorant to its nature and premise.... Disney had no hand in the storyline or music. Into The Woods was written by Stephen Sondheim, one of the greatest and most complex musical theater composers ever whose other works include Sweeney Todd and West Side Story, so I really don't think any of you are in the place to say that the lyrics or composition was inadequate. Yes, the movie is mostly singing, but if you knew or cared to research anything about the show you would have known that. And yes, they do repeat songs, this is something in a musical called a ""reprise."" Singing is equivalent to dialogue if you would just listen to the words. There are some bizarre moments, such as the wolf's seduction of Little Red, but let me assure you this is intentional.... Sondheim takes the traditional fairytale and turns it on its head, seeking to show a more realistic version because life isn't all daisies and heroes. Perhaps the flaw here was that Disney produced it and therefore drew an audience expecting something different entirely. Not sure what ""wrong notes"" people are talking about because I find it hard to believe that in over a year of post-production they wouldn't have fixed that using pitch technologies. You're probably just hearing Sondheim's tendency for minors and dissonance. I was so enraged by the awful reviews of this movie that I've come on my mother's account to give this movie the support it needs. The casting may not have been perfectly ideal, and maybe the storyline got a little chopped in Disney's rendition, but this film really does not deserve the sh*tstorm that it is receiving. I personally am a huge fan of Sondheim and have performed Into The Woods before, I was not wholly disappointed by the film and found myself entertained and enlightened by it.

I saw the trailer for this movie and although it was a musical (no, I'm not the biggest fan of them) I saw the cast and thought I would give it a go. One of the main draws was that it looked like it would be a bit of a twisted fairy tale, like the Grimm stories, which hasn't really been done much.I wasn't really aware of the original production, but from looking at the reviews it appears that this should have been, as I had suspected, a bit of a dark humour twist on classic tales. I think that in Disney's attempt to make this more PG, they have kind of missed the point and have taken out all of the plot points that make the story make sense.A few people have been a bit appalled by the lack or morality and slight hint at paedophilia, but I think that they took out too much of what could have made this a great movie by trying to turn it into something it is not- kid friendly.You cannot fault the actors' performance, they were all very good, just wasted! This could have been something quite entertaining but instead was a dragging waste of two hours (I'm really sorry Meryl but it was).

Boring, annoying, borderline pedophilia in some song lyrics, and a story line that makes you want to rip your (and Rapunzel's) hair out. DO NOT RENT. Waste of time and money. The few brief moments of comedy are not worth the hours of pain and torture. I am someone who enjoys musicals, as are my parents who watched with me.

I have never seen a musical film as boring as this. I have never scrolled any movies forward, just to get to see how it ends and at this point, when. 2 hours of repetitive, flat, annoying and very boring music. It seemed that the musical author just dragged the music out of something but never really got in to it. I think that good musical film deserves real composer. Also the script was actually pointless... And the Rapunzel hair? I have never ever seen wig so ugly and unnatural. I'm glad i saw it for free and i'm glad i didn't go to the movies with my children.

""I know musicals and they were out of tune"" then saying that it's all on the same tune. It's worth every minute guys! Don't listen to these buffoons. I'm a grown man, who tends to dislike a lot of musicals and at times have turned my head at Disney for what they can sometimes stand for. But, this is a fantastic adaptation of our favorite fairy tales from the brothers Grimm all balled up into one.They say there is no story line! These critics probably read bad reviews, watched it with a closed mind and then obnoxiously talked whilst the introduction played out. The story line is VERY clear and it's maintained throughout the film. It is long, but if I was having as much fun as they were I'd have to do more too! The music is simply moving, Meryl Streep is once more mind-blowingly talented, expressing raw emotion in her acting and her singing. Do you have no ears?? (Speaking to these negative 1* ratings) My advise, stop reading these reviews until you've watch the film, on your own, with no other influences around you! It's truly magical. Hopefully, you come back to this page and realise these stuck-up 'buffs' get paid to write bad reviews and most likely don't have a career in films, the world of critic and/or music!Enjoy the film guys, it's uplifting, refreshing, scary, magical, creepy, tearful, joyful and above all memorable!",Into the Woods

The only major change is with one aspect of Rapunzel's storyline.There are 3 types of people who hated the movie: 1. Parents who thought this isn't suitable for kids. Well, this doesn't say anything about how good the movie actually is. Yes, not all the content is for kids; heck the original isn't meant for kids at all. Even then, I don't think its that worrisome. If you think it is, just don't let your kids watch it; but you can enjoy the story. 2. Fans of the original who are complaining about every little change. People, its an adaptation; certain things need to be changed when transitioning to a different medium of storytelling. And some of the small changes are actual improvements to the original. 3. Those who weren't expecting a musical. I don't get this one. If you don't like musicals, fine! But you can't rate it 1 star just because its a musical!If you are looking for a typical Disney movie, look away. But if you care about originality and want to witness familiar stories in a different light, this is it. It has Disney characters but uses them to deliver a more realistic and mature point of view about the world. The story as a whole has some really good messages, but people seem to be stuck up on the fact that it defied their expectations.

907,mhaines-84029,it was an awful movie,1,13 January 2016,"Stagewise, the 1987 musical has been done twice on Broadway and yet again in 2012, this time with Amy Adams at Shakespeare in the Park. All three productions were flawed, to say the least — and a lot of that has to do with ""Into the Woods"" being incredibly boring.Basically the show is Sondheim and book writer James Lapine's attempt to reveal the dark side of classic fairy tales. Here, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, a wolf, assorted princes, irksome step-relatives and others are on a collision course with each other — and with the grim consequences of getting what you wish for.All this wrapped up in a convoluted, repetitive story line.As Broadway's famously irascible Jackie Hoffman recently tweeted: ""Into the woods; I'm not following this plot and its frigging fairy tales.""Sondheim and Lapine seem to believe they're the only ones who've figured out the great cosmic joke the Brothers Grimm et al. have been playing on us for centuries: Happily ever after is a sham.This message is repeated ad nauseam since this joyless musical doesn't like anything as much as saying the same thing 10 times over: It's dangerous out there in the woods! Don't go into the woods! Oh you went into the woods and something bad happened?

That club was the only reason I graduated. I challenge any who give a negative rating to a movie/musical to step into the role they are dragging down. Put on a costume, assume the role of someone who is drastically different from yourself and act. Get up on stage and sing your heart out. Get your butt out on stage and perform.

911,alecpestov,"Boring, incoherent mess without any redeeming qualities.",1,2 July 2016,"An army of A-list actors and decent visuals only magnify the disappointment that this movie brings.Right from the beginning, the movie develops as a typical garden-variety musical - dull and unimaginative songs with instantly forgettable tunes that come across as transition from one melody to another, but never as a complete song. Safe ""tried-and-tested"" jokes and lyrics that was written in bulk at discount match the music.But it is easy to overlook all of the above because there is a sense of anticipation. For the first hour this helps to see abrupt, disjointed and unnecessary plot lines, inconsistent character development (or lack of thereof) and general mess as something ""artistic"" that is going to come together in an unexpected twist that would make the whole thing great. And at some point it almost does. But instead, it falls apart in such a grandiose wreck that is bound to empty theaters and force people to change channels.If it wasn't for the names behind this disaster, it would have been a ""straight-to-DVD"" movie.

It could have been so much better done as a regular film. Some singing would have even been appropriate and they could have written some nice songs for it but none of the performances in this film we're particularly remarkable.There was a point where everything was resolved and everyone was happy and the movie could have ended and I would have been thrilled if it was over then, but then it just kept going and the plot got worse. If they had just ended with a happy Disney ending, I would have been less annoyed by the film.

914,sarahlicsko,Waste of time and money,1,12 October 2016,"OK, so I thought this movie was going to be some sort of an adventure, not a musical. I saw the trailer for it and I was so excited to see it. I saw that it had Johnny Depp in it so then I got really excited! What I didn't know was that he was going to be in it for a good 30 seconds and never show up again but that's beside the point. I don't particularly like musicals so that's not why I went. The trailer did have a song or two in it, that's to be expected for a Disney film, but that never screamed to me musical. Not once in the trailer did it say it was a musical. For example, the movie trailer for Les Miserables it clearly says, ""based on the original stage musical."" The trailer for Into The Woods is extremely misleading. After the movie was over I had to look up how this movie came to be and saw that it was a Broadway musical. I had no idea before that because the trailer never mentioned it. They shouldn't assume everyone knows what this movie is going to be about. That's the first thing I have a problem with in this movie. I realized that the movie had occasionally singing in it but that's to be expected from a Disney movie. What I didn't realize was that the whole movie was going to be a blur of so many songs you cannot keep up with the story. That's my next problem. The first scene comes on and they start singing, and singing, and don't stop singing for about ten minutes. The next scene comes on and does the same thing. I just told myself to get over it because it might end up being a really good movie. I was so wrong; all the songs were so boring I almost fell asleep a couple times. They all sounded the same to me too, there was no variation in their tone whatsoever. I do like the cast they chose for the movie though, they all have amazing voices, it's just a shame their voices had to be heard in this movie. I also don't have a problem with the dark fairy tales, I think that is a really good idea but definitely not for a musical. On stage they might have pulled it off but on the big screen is was just tacky and weird. The whole movie got increasing weird as it went on. I wanted to walk out but like I said earlier I had hope.

The genius of Sondheim is the way he weaves complicated lyrics and music into a brilliant score. The casting was outstanding in this production. Meryl Streep, Anna Kendrick, Emily Blunt, and Tracy Ullman all give fine performances. The two young singers playing Red Riding Hood and Jack are very talented. It's a musical. That is not a spoiler.

916,jasoncarlson,amazing let down,4,7 December 2016,"This is a hard review to give. I'm a huge fan of Into The Woods ever since I saw it on PBS with Bernadette Peters almost 30 years ago. I've made it a point to see it whenever a nearby theatre puts it on as well, even if just a high school play.First of all the visuals are amazing...the cinematography brought this to life. The actors were also well cast and for the most part did an excellent job. But the director failed in my opinion to capture the essence of the story and the movie lost almost all the humor although he did capture a bit of it in the Agony song between the two princes. The music was mostly dark which took away from many of the comedic lines.My biggest complaint is they cut out the wrong parts. I've seen this shortened before and a high school drama teacher did a better job keeping the essence of the story. Part of what made this great was how they tied in so many fairy tales yet there was no Sleeping Beauty or Snow White (as there was no second Agony song by the princes). What about the slotted spoon, which really captures the story behind the story of how we often miss what is amazing right in front of us because we have this constant desire for more.People who I've watched it with didn't see hardly any humor that I saw...but I was seeing it with a bigger picture of the entire story. It just had gaps and it had a depressing ending rather than an inspiring ending. And what was with the David vs Goliath bit at the end there... it just seemed really out of place.I bought the original 1990 PBS version where the visual quality is seriously lacking in comparison but it is just so much more enjoyable to watch. It is a shame the 2014 version didn't do honor to the talented actors that were cast for this nor to the writers of the story.",Into the Woods
917,HowlingCommando,A promising concept that falls apart in the third act,4,16 December 2014,"I'm going to preface this by stating that I am completely unfamiliar with the source material. I've never seen the stage version of James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim's musical, never heard the songs before, and I had no idea what the story was about. I do, however, enjoy movie musicals. In fact, Rob Marshall's adaptation of ""Chicago"" is one of my all time favorites. Now to this film...The songs, cast, direction, cinematography, and production design are all top-notch. Obviously, you want good music in a musical, and Mr. Sondheim doesn't disappoint. Rob Marshall clearly knows what he's doing by now, as he expertly captures the actors performances, with camera work that sweeps you off your feet. I'm no expert on singing, but everyone in the cast seemed to be bringing their A game. The only performance I didn't really care for was Johnny Depp's, but thankfully he's only around for about one song.For the first two-thirds of this movie, I was having a great time. The intersecting stories were interesting, the characters were fun, the (often dark) comedy was hilarious. Then came the third act.This is where, I assume, the second act in the stage version begins. But what would probably make sense for the second half of a live musical, is instead jammed into the last 30 minutes of the film version. Usually in films, the third act is where all of the conflicts, character motivations - everything that has been building up over the first two acts, comes to a head. Instead, Into the Woods resolves all of the conflicts by the end of act two, and then starts over with new ones in act three. We're now effectively watching a new movie.This might not be as big an issue if the pacing didn't come to a crawl in the final act. There seem to be less songs, and the few there are end up slowing down the story, instead of driving it. Characters that were stomping through the woods with purpose, now seem to be wandering aimlessly, bumping into other characters for more contrived conflict. Nothing feels organic or fresh anymore, and by the end I was just thankful the damn movie was over.I realize that fans of the stage version will probably like this film a lot more than I did. They'll probably ""get"" the story's unusual ending, because they are aware of the original creator's intentions. But I can only judge this film based on its own merits. And on its own, it is not very good.",Into the Woods

The movie is full of famous actors, but their acting in this movie was very half-assed and amateurish. None of them did a convincing job.The Story:
I know it's a fantasy/fairytale, it doesn't supposed to make sense. But the story was weird just for the sake of being weird, it was not entertaining at all to watch, both for kids and adults alike.The Costume & Makeup:
With Disney's budget, the costume and makeup were very amateurish and cheap looking. None of them were innovative nor impressive.

OK so someone said tat the witch turned herself into mud? No! If yo were listening to the song lyrics you would know that the witch did not turn herself into mud, her mother dragged her to hell through some acid pool.
