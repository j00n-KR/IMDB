0,Leofwine_draca,Silly thriller,4,26 July 2014,"THE GLASS HOUSE is another over-plotted, overwritten and entirely overblown Hollywood thriller that goes over age-old ground without ever finding its own original standing. It's a sanitised, teen-friendly movie with a teen lead and a narrative that hints at plenty but never once approaches anything remotely dark.The story goes that the youthful protagonist (played by the utterly cold Leelee Sobieski) and her younger brother are sent to live with some family friends after they're orphaned in a car accident. The girl soon realises that something's seriously wrong in their new home, a sinister situation embodied by an overacting Stellan Skarsgard (a guy who seems to be typecast as the bad guy in Hollywood).That's a halfway decent premise, but THE GLASS HOUSE wastes its potential as it goes on, ending up mired in a muddled middle and uninspiring climax. You can literally work out everything that's going to happen in the first half hour, and there are no surprises or genuine shocks. There's no decent acting, either; bringing in Bruce Dern as the family lawyer doesn't do much, while Daniel Sackheim's direction is staid and uninspiring. It's best to give this one a miss.",The Glass House
1,SnoopyStyle,Leelee too calm for scary movie,5,10 November 2013,"Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski) is orphaned when her parents die in a car crash. She and her brother moves in with family friends Terry (Stellan Skarsgård) and Erin Glass (Diane Lane). When she starts wondering about their substantial trust fund, the Glasses turn on them.Leelee Sobieski is too damn calm. That's a big no no in a horror movie if she wants to be the frightened little girl. There is some great potential for super creepiness. Stellan Skarsgård is able to project that creepy old guy. But it never elevates to the level of a scary movie. It ends up being a weak scare and perfunctory action. And the start seems to have been negated by the move. The whole thing seems simplified and shallow.",The Glass House

And while I usually am more forgiving and leniant ... that's what others tell me ... well in this case, it is just too much. The way the characters act and react ... suspension of disbelief, I know. I just couldn't .. there is just too much of it.Good actors are involved in this, but even they can't save it really. Predictable to say the least ...

3,lee_eisenberg,Glass-ical film or not?,6,27 June 2006,"The seemingly-good-people-turn-out-to-be-something-else plot has been used so many times that another one hardly registers. Don't get me wrong. ""The Glass House"" isn't a bad movie by any stretch, but the plot seems pretty routine. Still, the movie itself manages to be pretty intense, building things up in such a way that usually only would happen in an Ira Levin novel. As it is, you just may never trust anyone again after watching this movie.So, all in all, it's an OK movie. But I do usually expect just a little bit better from Leelee Sobieski, Diane Lane, Stellan Skarsgard and Bruce Dern.So should people in glass houses throw stones?",The Glass House
4,rmax304823,Teen-aged Orphan Girl in Jeopardy.,2,16 December 2009,"An egregious piece of commercial trash, uninspired and soulless.Leelee Sobieski is a 16-year-old whose wealthy parents were just killed in a traffic ""accident."" She and her younger brother are handed over to the only guardians available -- Stellan Skarsgard and his wife Diane Lane. But mischief is afoot. The guardians owe an enormous amount of money to the mob and intend to cheat Sobieksi and her brother out of the four million bucks in the trust fund. They'll kill the kids if necessary. After all, it turns out, they engineered the parents' car so as to disable it, disposing of the parents and leaving the two kids as helpless orphans. Something like that.Leelee Sobieski, I kind of like. Her acting talents may be modest but at least they exist. And her features are memorable -- those plump cheeks, that tiny mouth whose upper lip is chevron shaped, and those startling blue Tartar eyes. She reminds me of Dee Dee Myers, the former adviser to President Clinton. Dee Dee, Leelee. Might they not be one and the same person? True, I am nervous. Very, very nervous, but why WILL you call me mad? Let me put it this way. Have you ever seen the two of them in the same room at the same time? I thought not. Stellan Skarsgard is always dependable, and sometimes more than that. The other performers fade into the woodwork.It's the plot that sinks this attempt at a chiller. There isn't a single instant that doesn't make a viewer feel that, somewhere, some time, he's seen this before. (And he has.) It incorporates every cliché in the formula.I'll give just one example. Skarsgard is making a private, incriminating phone call late at night in his Malibu mansion. Sobieski is downstairs in the kitchen. She picks up the second phone and pushes ""Listen."" She accidentally makes a slight noise. Skarsgard hears it and begins to creep suspiciously toward the kitchen, but Sobieski doesn't know he's heard. Closer and closer. Cross-cutting between the scowling Skarsgard with the phone to his ear and the unsuspecting wide-eyed Sobieski behind the kitchen door. Skarsgard reaches the door. Sobieski yanks her head around. Skarsgard flings the door open. No Sobieski. She's darted away just in time.This sort of thing goes on and on. In the climactic auto chase, Skarsgard rams through a wall and his Jaguar rolls down a cliff and smashes to pieces.I glanced gratefully heavenward -- at least they'd managed to avoid the ritual of the corpse leaping back to life. But, no. While Sobieski and her brother sit alone in their silent car on the highway, the shockingly bloodied Skarsgard staggers through the hole in the wall with the intent of killing the two children. You know what I want to be when I grow up? One of the heavies in a horror movie. They never die. They take a beating but keep on ticking.If you've never seen a movie before -- if you've never HEARD of movies -- you'll probably find this one engaging.",The Glass House
5,BA_Harrison,Sobieski just about makes it worthwhile...,5,27 August 2013,"As much as I like me some Sobieski, especially when wearing a bikini as she does here, I cannot recommend The Glass House as anything other than a mildly entertaining yet instantly forgettable piece of trash; it certainly doesn't work as a taut psychological thriller as intended, the far-fetched nature of the scenario draining any tension from proceedings.Lovely Leelee plays Ruby, the oldest of two siblings who go to live with new guardians, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgård and Diane Lane), after their parents die in a car crash. As time passes, Ruby begins to suspect that her parents' wreck was not an accident, but that they were actually murdered by Terry in order to get his hands on the children's $4m trust fund.A hackneyed plot loaded with implausible situations and predictable outcomes ensures that The Glass House never achieves the edge-of-the-seat atmosphere it aims for. As the film approaches its final act, the level of preposterousness goes off the chart, Terry becoming an indestructible killing machine who survives certain death to return for one more attempt at killing meddling teenager Ruby.Still, Sobieski does look mighty fine in that swimsuit...",The Glass House
6,moonspinner55,"Ridiculous, illogical, overwrought",4,27 January 2006,"Teen melodrama posing as a thriller has mopey 16-year-old girl (Leelee Sobieski, taking 'sullen' to a new plateau) and her pre-teen brother suddenly orphaned when their parents are mysteriously killed in a car wreck; wealthy friends of the family take the kids in, but Sobieski immediately smells a rat in the ritzy woodwork and starts playing sleuth. On a non-think level, the film is watchable, maybe even dopey fun (it's certainly well-cast, although I don't know what the hell Diane Lane is doing playing second fiddle to Leelee Sobieski). However, the plot threads completely unravel in the final stretch, leading to a series of events which are so outlandish, they'd be a real hoot if the picture didn't take itself so seriously. Sobieski, looking like Helen Hunt's little sister (but with the same impenetrable expression throughout), gets stuck portraying an inconsistently-developed character, but she does have her moments (particularly in a well-written dinner scene with Stellan Skarsgård). Daniel Sackheim's heavy-handed direction forces the overripe style of the piece, while poor Bruce Dern (as the family lawyer, who keeps switching sides) and Kathy Baker (as an agent with Child Protective Services, so easily bamboozled she makes all such agents look bad) come off looking like incompetents. ""The Glass House"" had a fair amount of promise which goes sadly unrealized. Followed by a video sequel in 2006. *1/2 from ****",The Glass House
7,Quinoa1984,"Knew the plot from the start, with or without the trailer's help",4,14 September 2001,"The Glass House, a new suspense thriller from the guy who brought you the drek known as I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, Soul Survivors, what have you.  Anyway, it is so routine with the shots, performances and even in just the design alone that if the actors were playing themselves they'd probably get impatient and I'd be outta the theater in 15 minutes.Well, if you wanna know the plot, here goes.  A teen girl (like the sound of that, especially with Sobieski in the role) and her kid brother have a sadness in they're life when they're parents die in a car accident.  The new guardians, old friends the Glasses (Skarsgard and Lane) who take them into they're home, however not everything is as it seems, and, well you know how the number goes.  Hardly even worth the rental when it comes out on video, only miniscule perks are seeing Sobieski, and Lane acting like a Junkie. D+",The Glass House
8,michaelRokeefe,It is not easy to hide in a house of glass.,5,31 December 2002,"This thriller has the chances of being a real chiller...but falls apart. The script leaves a lot to be desired in a story that has too many holes in it. Two orphaned kids(Leelee Sobieski and Trevor Morgan) go to live with a wealthy couple(Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane) who are not as benevolent as they seem. The couple is cash strapped and intend to swindle the youngsters out of their inheritance. Some pretty wicked behavior keeps interest alive. Sobieski and Lane do their best with the characters they have to work with, but both barely unleash their talent. Sobieski's sexpot appearance is wasted. Also in the cast are Bruce Dern, Chris Noth, Kathy Baker and Michael O'Keefe.",The Glass House
9,Theo Robertson,Kill That Glass Scumbag,5,15 December 2003,"If THE GLASS HOUSE had concentrated on the angst of Ruby Baker a sixteen year old girl orphaned in a car crash this might have been a better film , but the themes of parental loss and being an outsider aren`t as intensively explored as they could have been , instead we`re treated to a ludicurous thriller that feels extremely retro and would have possibly worked better if it was produced ten years earlier when "" The person from hell "" type movies were all the rage . Having said that THE GLASS HOUSE  wasn`t the worst movie I`d seen all week and it would have a poorer movie if it wasn`t for Stellan Skarsgard as scumbag Terry Glass . It would have been easy for Skarsgard to overplay his role but he gives a subdued performance which is very effective",The Glass House

12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Not the best, but an OK thriller",6,20 May 2004,"Having seen many thrillers, most of them being formulaic, I was somewhat excited to see this one, since it has a pretty good cast; Stellan Skarsgård, Leelee Sobieski & Diane Lane. The plot does, admittedly have some holes, but these newer thrillers are rarely(read: never) perfect. All things considered, it wasn't a disappointment, as I didn't have that high expectations. The plot is OK, fairly see-through and obvious though, but it does have some twists that I(even though I may be alone on this) wasn't expecting. The acting isn't anything special, but at least Skarsgård and Sobieski both pull of decent performances. The characters are reasonably well-written, none of them come off as one-dimensional stereotypes, even though some of them, in all honesty, more or less are. The script is fairly well-written, though it does have its share of cliches, but most films do, anyway. All in all, a fair addition to the thriller genre, nothing that will stay in your mind for a long while after seeing it. It will, however, most likely keep your interest for the duration of the film, and keep you entertained, too. I recommend it to fans of thrillers, it would help to be a fan of at least one of the actors, and it doesn't hurt to have reasonably low standards or expectations. 6/10",The Glass House
13,anaconda-40658,Throw Rocks At It.,3,5 November 2015,"The Glass House (2001): Dir: Daniel Sackheim / Cast: Leelee Sobieski, Stellan Skarsgard, Diane Lane, Bruce Dern, Chris Noth: Typical thriller that shatters into formula. Title refers to a family that owns a big house, the Glass couple. It is also made of glass as well. One could also interpret the title as a relationship to fragility. Leelee Sobieski plays a rebellious teenager who arrives home one evening to the news that her parents were killed in a car accident. She and her brother are secure in terms of money yet they are put under custody of the Glasses. From there Sobieski feels threatened over sexual hints by Mr. Glass, and Mrs. Glass is found with a needle in her arm. This all arrives at a pointlessly violent conclusion when Sobieski and her brother plot escape. Director Daniel Sackheim does a fair job, and the house gives off a nice ominous appeal, but the screenplay is a joke. Sobieski holds her own in a struggle to find escape and refuge before the laughable climax. Stellan Skarsgard as Mr. Glass is an idiot from the first reel. Diane Lane plays his fragile wife who perhaps could have taken measures than she did. Bruce Dern plays a crooked lawyer in what amounts to one of his dumbest roles. Chris Noth plays an uncle who is one of a long list of people not able to communicate with these kids. Pointless bore that shatters to bits within its first thirty minutes. Score: 3 ½ / 10",The Glass House
14,Wuchakk,Sad drama with Leelee Sobieski and Stellan Skarsgård switches to thriller,6,7 August 2019,"A suddenly orphaned teen girl (Leelee Sobieski) & her little brother start a new life in Malibu with their guardians (Stellan Skarsgård & Diane Lane), who might not be the caring friends of their parents they seem to be. Bruce Dern is on hand as a lawyer.""The Glass House"" (2001) starts as a melancholic drama with the general plot, setting and tone of ""Poison Ivy"" (1992), but without the lethal Lolita angle. It eventually morphs into a suspense/thriller à la ""Enough"" (2002), just don't expect Leelee to change into Rambo, like J-Lo.Sobieski as protagonist Ruby is one-dimensionally sullen, which fits the situation, but it gives a lifeless vibe to the proceedings. Things pick up in the second half though. Some critics claim the last act is predictable, but it's really not, excepting the fact that two people ultimately square off (which is obvious from the beginning). I'd cite examples but don't want to give away spoilers.The film runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, and was shot in Malibu & that general area of Los Angeles.GRADE: B-",The Glass House
15,zetes,Maybe the least thrilling thriller ever made,4,13 January 2002,"The major mistake of the filmmakers here was to make this film a thriller at all. It would have been better as just a drama. Still, it wouldn't have worked well at all. The film is paper thin in every way, and, as they did set out to make a thriller, it has no suspense whatsoever. I had great hopes for Leelee Sobieski. I've only seen her once elsewhere, in Eyes Wide Shut, but I was completely knocked over by her beauty. Now, two or three years after she made that film, she seems to have gotten uglier. Well, she was shorter than Tom Cruise in EWS, but now she's taller than Stellan Skarsgard. I don't know. Her character is poorly written, so she has no real chance to give a decent performance. The only character given some meat is that of Skarsgard, but he delivers what can only be his worst performance in this film. I didn't despise this film, really. I was just bored. It's not at all worth watching, but the climactic sequence is pretty amusing, although in the wrong way. 4/10.",The Glass House
16,whpratt1,Leelee Sobieski was Outstanding,10,14 August 2005,"Thought at first this film was going to be a slow boring film about a sister and her brother having problems. However, this film took me by surprise and I could hardly believe what Leelee Sobieski (Ruby Baker), ""Max"",'02 had to go through in her godfather's Glass House, who was 16 years of age and had to share a bedroom with her younger brother. Bruce Dern,(Begleiter),""Madison"",'01, played a foxy old man who offered Ruby Baker a helping hand and got himself into a big mess he never dreamed would happen to him in the House of Glass. The story has many twists and turns and does keep you on the edge of your seats, watching fancy cars going crazy on narrow mountain roads with plenty of sharp turns. Ruby even gets hit on by her godfather and even tries to avoid injections with a needle. Sit back and enjoy this very entertaining film with a great new Hot Star Leelee Sobieski.",The Glass House
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,I hated this movie,1,3 February 2004,"Ah, The Glass House, this is the movie I've tried to forget, I got dragged to the movie theater with my friends to see this, I just knew that I wasn't going to get into it. I feel bad because I always say to people even if you have a gut feeling that a movie is going to be bad, just try to have an open mind and enjoy the film. My main problem though? I can't stand Leelee Sobieski, seriously, ever since I saw Heaven on Earth, her face just, I can't describe it, she annoys the heck out of me. But I did decide rather than just complain through the whole movie, I would just try to sit and see maybe if the film could have been worth the watch at least, well, I was wrong.After losing their parents, Grace and Dave, in a car accident, Ruby and Rhett Baker are placed under the guardianship of Erin and Terry Glass, former neighbors/parents' best friends and childless couple who live in a large glass house in Malibu. Life is great for both siblings at first. However, Ruby soon discovers that her new foster parents are after the siblings' $4 million trust fund. Ruby discovers that the car her parents died in was a BMW loaned from the Glass' company and suspects that Mr. Glass was responsible for their deaths. Mrs. Glass watches an old home video of her and Ruby on a beach, happy and healthy. Then, overwhelmed with guilt, she overdoses and dies. Ruby wakes up the next morning with Mrs. Glass' dead body lying next to her. Shocked to find his wife dead, Mr. Glass traps Ruby and Rhett in the basement. Eventually, the two escape. After a brutal car accident due to Mr. Glass tampering with his own car in the same fashion as he did with the kids' parents.Honestly, this movie is just a waste of time, it's a very mediocre thriller that is, well for me at least, is just very predictable. The acting is lame as well as the story; but I will compliment the set, if you want me to give this movie a positive comment, there ya go. It's just a weak script, bad cast, and I can't wait to get this bad taste out of my mouth from this stupid movie, just writing this comment is making my health deteriorate. I have to stop, I'm sorry, just stay away from this movie, plant a tree, watch paint dry, that's much more useful then watching this movie.1/10",The Glass House

Wealthy foster daddy has his own agenda; to rip off the kid's $4 million trust while Sobieski counters armed only with her wits. A slick noirish  shoot with more talent in front of the lens than behind it, ""TGH"" is obvious, predictable, and full of hackneyed and contrived suspenseful situations with plotholes aplenty.

21,sddavis63,Generally Predictable Stuff,5,30 July 2011,"On the whole, this is a fairly predictable suspense/thriller with the expected twists and turns thrown in to try to throw the viewer off and keep us guessing, but in reality there was really only one plot point that I was really guessing about (revolving around the estate lawyer and where and to whom his loyalties really were) and that particular plot point wasn't really at the heart of the story. The movie introduces Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) as a bit of a troubled kid, whose troubles become much more complicated when her parents are killed in a car accident, and she and her brother are sent to live with the Glass family - friends of their parents (played by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane.) And, yes, the Glasses live in a house that seems to have a lot of glass - too cute by a longshot.The suspense is around the Glasses. What are they up to? They haven't been especially close to Ruby's parents in recent years, and there's a certain creepiness to them (and especially to Skarsgard's Terry) right from the start. That builds to the point where the Glasses become downright dangerous to the kids. However, there really isn't much mystery about what the Glasses want. (It's revealed fairly quickly that the kids have a large trust fund and that Terry needs money to pay off a loanshark he's in trouble with.) So there's no real suspense around motive, and you pretty much know that although it's going to be a rough ride the kids are going to end up OK (because they always do in this kind of movie.) So the story isn't really that compelling. The performances (mostly from Sobieski, Skarsgard and Lane) are decent, but I didn't think anyone in the cast was truly outstanding.Two things worked really well in the movie. Director Daniel Sackheim did a good job of gradually turning the Glasses from just a creepy couple into a dangerous couple. (At first, Terry's interest in the 16 year old Ruby was truly creepy - it seemed physical more than financial, a suggestion that was let go of fairly quickly in favour of the financial motive.) The other thing that worked well was the setting in the house. Yes, the play on words was a bit too cute, but the big house with its somewhat confusing design and all sorts of windows both inside and outside so that the characters (and the viewer) could often catch a glimpse of what was going on was effective. But, still, a suspense/thriller that's almost entirely predictable and that therefore has no real ""edge of your seat"" moments can't be considered truly good. (5/10)",The Glass House

Super-glossy image, decent acting (though I find Sobieski pretty boring as a lead) and a good, minimalist music score can't do much when the clumsy screenplay has so many conveniences (the heroine seems to have a mysterious knack for being in the right place at the right time to see/hear/find everything she needs to piece the truth together). The only well-handled aspect of the film is the subtle sexual tension between Sobieski and Skarsgard, but this sub-plot is soon dropped.     (*1/2)",The Glass House

With everything that Ruby and Rhett went through they never bothered to call Uncle Jack for help! The next and last time we see Uncle jack is at the end of the movie at the graveyard like we were first introduced to him; this shows just how disjointed the movie is. With their parents gone Ruby & Rhett are given, by the courts, into custody of the Glass' Terry & Erin, Stellan Skarsgard & Diane Lane. At first life could never be better for the kids but then strange things start to happen that made them at first feel uncomfortable and then terrorized by the couple. The nightly fights and the shooting up by Erin where she's left in a comatose state as well as Terry's involvement with the mob, he borrowed one million dollars from it, has put their lives in danger and they, or at least Ruby, want to leave the ""Glass House"" as fast as possible but where could they go and who could they trust? The Baker's estate lawyer Mr. Begleher, Bruce Dern,who according to the Baker's wishes had the Glass' take over the parenting of their underage children but he seems to also be involved in this scheme for the Glass' to defraud both Ruby & Rhett of the four million dollar inheritance that were left to them. What Mr. Begleher doesn't know is how much trouble his partner in crime, Terry Glass, is in with the mob wanting their cash that they loaned him, with interest, and how he's in the same situation that Terry is in by being his, unknowing, silent partner in the business that he has with the mobsters.""The Glass House"" would be a so/so made for TV movie if it weren't for the breathtaking photography of the California Pacific Coast highway and the beautiful Malibu coastline, there's also the stunning 18 year-old Leelee Sobeski to gaze at, Leelee's midnight dip in the Glass' indoor swimming pool was by far the best scene in the movie. The story never really made that much sense in the fact why the two kids were so helpless in getting help since there were the police the school the social workers and last but not least the very willing and able Uncle Jack to turn to.With Erin Glass dead of a drug overdose and Terry dead drunk from guzzling down a fifth of Vodka Mr. Begleher come over to house to see him about the money that he can't seem to get his hands on from the Baker children thrust. It then becomes obvious that they, the Glass' & Begleher, had something to do with the Baker's death. Just then the two mob collectors Don & Whitey, Vyto Ruginis & Gavin O'Connor, drop over to get the cash that Terry owes their boss which he of course he doesn't have and you can just guess what happens after that.",The Glass House
24,slightlymad22,Despite The Presence Of Lane & Stansgard It Is Sobieski Who Carries The Movie,7,9 October 2014,"Unfortunate to be released 3 days after the 9/11 attacks, this movie sank without a trace. The fact it's taken me thirteen years to watch a movie staring my childhood crush Diane Lane, the always usually reliable Stellan Skarsgard and one of my favourite young actress's of the era Leelee Sobieski says how badly this movie did and was reviewed upon release. When Ruby (Sobieski) and Rhett Baker's parents are killed in a car accident, they must travel to Malibu, to live with Terrence and Erin Glass, their former neighbours. But they are not the friendly couple the claim to be. The movie is massively flawed in several areas, I have never seen Lane put in a performance this bad before, and likewise Skarsgard puts in a career low performance. Only Sobieski puts in a good performance, and she certainly fills out a bikini nicely. Both talented and attractive in equal measure, it's because of her the movie succeeds where it does. I'm amazed her career never hit higher heights. Bruce Dern pops up in a role as a lawyer and he is also OK. A lot of my problems with this movie are more to do with the script and it's direction.It is lazily shot with just the actors seemingly placed in front of the camera. As for the script it does not have a natural flow with lots of things going on all at once and lots of things unexplained as characters come and go.Outside of Sobieski, there is little to enjoy, but another asset to this movie is the score. It hits all the rights spots, at all the right times. Despite everything I think the premise of the movie is a good one, and with Sobieski at the lead it's more than watchable. I think released a month earlier, this would have done very differently. A 7/10 is a generous score, but since the movie was carried solely by Sobieski it's a worthy one.",The Glass House

And little by little things are going down but all is well that ends well and I can't reveal the details, except that the uncle will get the kids he should have gotten from the very start since he was the only family.

27,zkonedog,Makes A Great First Impression (Even More So If You Are A Teen!),6,2 March 2017,"I initially watched ""The Glass House"" when it first came out on DVD and remembered it being a solid thriller. I recently watched the film with a more critical eye and, though I now realize it isn't a ""classic"" in any sense of the word, I was still entertained by it.For a basic plot summary, ""The Glass House"" sees siblings Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) and Rhett (Trevor Morgan) Baker orphaned when their parents die in a car wreck. As such, their new custodians (friends of the family) Terry (Stellan Skarsgard) and Erin (Diane Lane) Glass take them into their Malibu mansion. Though life seems to go okay for the youngsters at first, they soon discover that living with Mr. and Mrs. Glass may not be quite as innocent as it seems.""The Glass House"" is a movie that probably should be directed at teenagers. The themes are quite transparent and predictable, so adult viewers will likely see right through it (not unlike the Glass house itself!). However, teenagers will be much more willing to put aside their disbelief and just ""enjoy the ride"". If you can do that, this movie can suck you in.I wish I could say the acting in this movie is great, because at some parts it truly is, but the characters are so stereotypical for the thriller genre that it is tough to see them as anything but. Sobieski probably shines brightest in the piece, as she combines patented teenage sex appeal with some solid acting chops. Skarsgard & Lane are great actors in their own right, but (like I said) their characters are somewhat spoiled by predictability.I saw ""The Glass House"" as a teen, so it made an impact on me (hence the 4-star rating). It probably is more of a 3-star flick, truth be told. Yet, show it to the right audience and it can provide some decent entertainment as a thriller.",The Glass House
28,Anonymous_Maxine,What was all that nonsense about thrills and chills around every corner?,4,4 August 2003,"I read another reviewer who recommended The Glass House because of the satisfactory performance from Leelee Sobiesky despite the fact that there is little to nothing original in the movie. With all due respect, this doesn't strike me as a very relevant statement, because it's clear that Leelee Sobiesky is a massively talented actor, but The Glass House is simply a thriller that covers no new ground, and it doesn't even put any effort into being repetitive.The main problem that I had with The Glass House is that it's one of those thrillers that builds up and builds up and builds up and then just stops, like it forgot the climax. It is a creepy movie in that it contains characters, namely Terrance Glass, the parental guardian with serious money problems, who are so creepy as people that they are almost cartoonish. This is a man the likes of which exists nowhere on the face of the earth but in cheesy thrillers like The Glass House.Leelee Sobieski plays a teenage girl named Ruby whose parents are tragically killed in a car accident. When she and her younger brother are placed with foster parents, friends of the family, it becomes increasingly suspicious that they are the very people that killed them or had them killed. So this is where I get confused.The movie struck remarkably little interest with me, but from what I got, Terrance had the parents killed because he needed money, although we never really find out why. His living accommodations certainly do not suggest a lack of income. There were scenes where he was thrown against walls and whatnot by lowlifes who were demanding money, but my understanding was that they were demanding payment for pulling off the murder of the two parents.
So here's my question, and I would appreciate anyone who can set me straight on the matter. Since Terrance and his wife can afford a house as massive as the one in which they live (as well as a variety of badass sports cars, which include a flashy Jaguar and a freaking Ferrari Testarossa), why are they in need of money, if not to pay off the killers? If the money is NOT to pay off the killers, why did they need money in the first place? Were they in debt? Was Terrance so in love with his Testarossa that he would rather have a close friend killed than sell it to help pay off his debt?I'm sure I'm just missing something there, so it doesn't really bother me too much, but Terrance's cheesy creepiness (consider, for example, the scene where he swerves recklessly into oncoming traffic and then skids onto the side of the road, only to reach over and buckle Ruby's seat belt as though everything's normal) by itself reduces the film the b-movie obscurity. Oh, and never mind the way he talks. Can't they create a bad guy without making him talk like Darth friggin' Vader?I can't say that The Glass House is not entertaining, because it is, but even that ends up counting against it in the end. The movie most certainly is intriguing, because it piques your curiosity as to why there is so much deception and murder in it, and we want to know the real motives and who the real killers are and all that (or if the parents were really killed at all), but like I said before, the movie builds up literally until the point where it ends, leaving us with the feeling that we just watched an entire movie waiting for a revelation that was never revealed. If you're in the mood for a thriller, watch Clay Pigeons or something. The Glass House plays like the script had a lot of stones thrown at it.",The Glass House
29,GOWBTW,"Throw rocks and other projectiles at the critics, not the movie!",8,3 June 2006,"Suspense is what drives a good movie. ""The Glass House"" is a very intriguing and suspenseful movie. I don't why the critics put down on it. I thought it's very entertaining. I don't know about the script, but the plot is very good. Being orphaned is a painful process to go through. An accident is an accident right? For some people it's hard to accept, for Ruby(Leelee Sobieski) and Rhett(Trevor Morgan) their parents death was NO accident! It was total sabotage. The Baker siblings suspect their guardians The Glasses(Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane) of their murder. The Bakers live in their house, but the living conditions makes the slums look like a better place to live. Ruby has no privacy, when she changes clothes, she knows it's not her brother watching. When they found out that The Glasses are after the money, it's up to themselves to stop these greedy guardians. This movie is kinda of like most other movies I've seen, somehow, the sex appeal, and the mind-games are always there to make it look good. Fine movie, fine cast, I probably ambush the The Glass House in a gauntlet and made sure the kids are safe. Better yet, sell everything the Glasses own! Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",The Glass House
30,ebiros2,Pretty Awful !!,2,27 April 2011,"I couldn't get into this one. The chief reason being the wooden acting done by Leelee Sobieski.I couldn't get to like the expression on her (or expressionless) face and her low mumbling voice. You need to put in at least some character into the part you're playing, but this is high school stage play level of acting. I couldn't feel any life out of her at all. I have other things I'd like to say about her but I wouldn't get into it.With the star so out of it, the story had no chance of survival, and the supporting actor's weren't anything to mention about either.

31,drownnnsoda,Standard But Entertaining Teenage Thriller.,6,11 March 2007,"""The Glass House"" is another standard but fairly entertaining thriller. The story revolves around Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski, ""Joy Ride""), whose parents die in a horrible car accident. Scarred from the incident, Ruby and her brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan), move in with their previous long-time neighbors and friends, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgaard and Diane Lane), in their luxurious glass home located in the hills on the California coast. Things seem normal enough at first, although Ruby isn't used to their kind of lifestyle - the Glasses can buy them literally anything they want. Rhett has a new Playstation and plenty of games, and Ruby is given a brand new Mac laptop, just to name a few of the items they've received. But the more time she spends at the house, she begins to realize that things aren't all cop-acetic, and that Terry and Erin aren't quite as friendly as they may appear, and that they might be holding a dark secret related to Ruby.While it is an admittedly predictable teenage thriller, ""The Glass House"" still manages to be consistently entertaining despite it's clichés and shortcomings. The storyline isn't anything too original - teen moves in with seemingly-friendly adoptive parents who may have ulterior motives. The same type of thing has been done before, so in that respect this film doesn't offer much of anything new. Is it clichéd? Yes, it surely is. Despite that though, it does have some nice touches to it and is never uninteresting at all. The way the story begins to unfold is predictable, and I knew what was going to happen next before it even happened, but I was still interested and entertained with it. But a large majority of films are predictable - doesn't mean they can't be enjoyable though.There is some nice cinematography in the movie, and the glass house itself is really an amazing set piece. Reflections, lightness, and darkness are all used in conjunction with the glass walls, and create an eerie atmosphere for the movie at appropriate times. The movie does lack real scares, but it's more of a thriller than anything so I suppose that's irrelevant. Just don't go in expecting it to be a full-blown horror movie, because it's not at all. The cast is led by Leelee Sobieski, and she is good enough to carry the film. Stellan Skarsgaard and Diane Lane play the two-sided foster parents, who are both friendly and menacing, as their characters should be. There are a few other familiar faces in the cast as well, including Trevor Morgan as Rhett, and Kathy Baker as a counselor/social worker. The acting in the film is overall pretty good. The movie's conclusion, as is a lot of other things in this film, is predictable, but it's satisfying as well so I can't really complain too much about it.The bottom line is, if you're tired of the typical ""teen thrillers"" out there, then you'll probably want to skip ""The Glass House"". But if you don't mind movies of this type (or if you enjoy them), it's a very entertaining one and is worth a look. I'll rate it just one point above average because I personally enjoyed it despite it's predictability. 6/10.",The Glass House

First of all, I did like the casting decisions and I thought the actors did a pretty good job with their roles. The plot was intriguing to me, the whole idea of them taking in orphaned teens for the WRONG reason really interested me, and there were scenes where I think they succeeded at creating creepiness and tension in the atmosphere, like the undressing in the hallway scene, or the pool scene for example. The writing is average, not laughably bad, but not all that great either. I think personally, my favorite part of the film was Diane Lane, Leelee, and the tense scenes, including the ending.

The same went for actresses Katie Holmes, Michelle Williams, Rachel Miner, and many others. But in the end, many celebrities have had to show more than there acting skills. It is hard to be a sex symbol in the movie industry and continue to have a good career without showing all of your goods. Only a handful of actresses have gotten away from this stereotype that usually falls upon many of the quote ""sexy"" female celebrities. If a pole was taken on the reason why most viewers went to see or rented this movie, I am sure the high majority of viewers will admit they went to get a glimpse of Leelee's leelees! If not for the ""pool scene"" where we get to see Ms. Sobieski in a two piece swimsuit, the film has very little else to show for.

Meaning, the universal story is not only a drama but a story that deals with the human experience or a historical event like a world war (Gone With the Wind, Dances with Wolves, etc.) The Glass House is far from anything serious or anything timeless. The movie's plot is about 3 minutes long with a story that most of the audience knew what was going to happen within the first 30 minutes. The pool scene is pure eye candy. The scene has nothing to do with the movie except for maybe some character development. Getting to see Leelee Sobieski in a 2 piece swim suit is one of the very few reasons to watch this move.

38,vertigo_14,"Come out, come out, wherever you are. (spoilers)",7,10 March 2005,"You might initially be reluctant to give 'The Glass House' a try if you've been turned off by many recent ""thrillers"" as they often have been disappointingly by the book. This is your eerie psychotic chase thriller similar to movies like 'Pacific Heights' and 'Unlawful Entry.' And, though it does play by the rules (unforutnately), there is something about it that makes it more entertaining than the recent dismal fare (not that Pacific Heights wasn't highly entertaining).Leelee Sobieski plays Ruby Baker, a kid going through the terrible teens. When she and her brother's parents die in a car accident, they move in with ultra-modern family friends, Terry and Erin Glass. You know right from the start that there is something dreadfully suspicious and exceedingly bizarre about the Glass couple, but you can never be too sure exactly what at first (that's the purpose of a thriller, to throw you a few hints and let your quick assumptions guide you into all the wrong paths so that you're--hopefully--pleasantly surprised when the real perpetrator and his motives are revealed). But, Ruby Baker is a smart kid who's ever-present skepticism about the intentions of her new surrogate parents, and starts trying to figure out what's wrong. Unfortunately, this movie does terribly follow the book when it comes to the main character being disbelieved by other well-meaning characters (social workers, lawyers, teachers, etc.) who consequently pay with their lives for their doubts and unwillingness to really investigate, and in turn, making things worse for poor Ruby. It also follows the book when it comes to the deranged finale and the he's-not-really dead ending.But, there is something that makes this better than most of its kind. On the one hand, you're never sure whether you can always trust Ruby because even she, too, arrogant most of the time, seems like trouble. It's hard to sympathize for a character like that at first. And, not only does Stellan Skarsgård make an appropriate villain as Terry Glass, his wife (played by Diane Lane) is not entirely an innocent creature herself as most women are often written to be in the role of the creep's wife/girlfriend/mother, etc. A good mix of characters and a creepy setting, combined with a decent finale, make it just the perfect mix of suspenseful elements. And one that I would recommend seeing.",The Glass House
39,Samiam3,Glass is cold,6,27 December 2010,"The title of this motion picture has a double meaning a) it's about a house made of glass. b) it is a house that belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Glass. These two have become the appointed legal guardians of Ruby Baker and her younger brother. They have just lost their parents to a car accident and are now moving in with the Glass'. The house is roomy and impressive, Ruby Baker doesn't feel much at home yet, but as least she is being provided for. Or is she? Slowly she starts to suspect that the Glass' are keeping something hidden, and the more she tries to find out, the more danger she is putting herself in along with her brother. She wants out, but she's got nowhere to go.With Hitchcock on its mind, The Glass House is stepped mostly in suspense and psychological camera-work. That and a well played rivalry between Leelee Sobieski and Stellen Skarsgaard make for a reasonably entertaining scary thriller, but sometimes it feels questionable. The plot uses contrived devices, the biggest of which you don't really notice till the very ending, at which point you realize that the whole scenario needs a rethinking. Another problem I have is that Skargard and Diane Lane don't go well together. Mrs. Glass is poorly characterized, and as a result, Lane has too little to work with, and she's not a good actress. Despite being in Sunny California, the obvious intention is to make you feel cold. this is sold to us in the style of lighting accompanied by an increase in rain, and a major lack of sunlight. The house itself is quite a piece of architecture. Again with all the glass and the lack of carpeting, this would be a cold place to live, and it spaciousness means that there arn't a lot of places to hide...not a good case scenario. The Glass House is strictly for fans of the genre, but even at that, it may only appeal to a small number of viewers. I'm not convinced it does a good job of suspending disbelief, but it does a good enough job of being chilling to make it watchable, maybe a good film for a rainy night (when it might be scarier to watch)",The Glass House

But there were way to many Hollywood horror clichés and the movie , which was never exactly fun to watch became brittle by the end.

43,aimless-46,Two Very Nice Performances,6,19 June 2007,"""The Glass House"" (2001) is one of those films that you enjoy during the viewing thanks to good directing, good technical film-making (production design-nicely staged action sequences-odd camera angles), and convincing dialogue; but look back at feeling generally dissatisfied. In part this is due to the moronic final ten minutes but then you realize that the premise itself is the real problem. You don't mind suspending disbelief during the viewing but afterward you resent the fact that a less elaborate script would have made your efforts unnecessary. The film is yet another example of Hollywood's ability, given a relatively large budget $20-30 Million, to put together a good-looking and visually believable suspense movie. It brings skilled technique to a plot that's a foregone conclusion, so the viewer must wait patiently for the characters to catch up. For film buffs (those who like to read a film) there is a fairly ambitious subtext inside ""The Glass House""; working on both conscious and sub-conscious levels. Warm (orange tones) lighting for the safe/secure scenes and cold (blue tones) lighting for the places where things are off-kilter. The Glasses (Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard) literally live in a ""glass"" house above the Malibu beach. The theme, that nothing is what it appears to be, is supported by a production design of reflective surfaces; mirrors, glass, and water (its always raining) that distort the images. Mrs. Glass is a physician in a pain center who is secretly addicted to her own medications. Mr. Glass runs a seemingly thriving limo service transporting famous clients behind smoked glass windows. There are several references to ""Hamlet"" with Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski) essentially in the role of the Melancholy Dane. The writer must have had this linked together much better in the screenplay but apparently several key elements of this dynamic never made it into production. This story is told entirely from Hamlet's point of view, a Hamlet who is frustratingly slow on the uptake and unable to make up her mind. And the viewer is supposed to be wondering what is real, what is wrongly perceived, and what is paranoid illusion. They even try to fool you with a dream sequence involving the return of Ruby's mother. Fortunately Sobieski (who looks like a young Helen Hunt) is an excellent actress and up to the challenge. Her performance (she is in every scene) keeps you focused on her story. The many scenes between her and Skarsgard are the film's real strength; they must carry the film since no one else in the cast is much of a factor. The film opens with a ""film with a film"" device, which turns out to be a horror film, late- night viewing for Ruby and her rave-loving high school friends. This is an early clue to the ""nothing is what it seems to be"" theme. It turns out that Ruby is quite a party animal and has been successfully deceiving her parents about her nocturnal activities. This night she returns home to find police cars parked outside her house. Believing herself finally busted she enters the house only to be told that her parent's were both killed in a car accident earlier that evening. This sets the stage for life with the Glass family, a childless couple who were friends with her parents. You instantly sense that they are odd, even those the director works so hard to make them appear normal that they come off as too nice. Ruby and her little brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan) leave the San Fernando Valley to live with them in their hilltop house. Can you say: ""Hansel and Gretel in a Gingerbread cottage""? Things are weird from the start as the two children must share a room. Whatever the original rationale for this idea might have been, is lost in the deleted scenes of the screenplay and it just seems silly and illogical (given the Glasses long-term plans). I assume that it is included to reinforce the idea that living in a glass house offers no privacy but who knows. From this point a lot of stuff happens which can be taken in several different ways with the director constantly laying misdirection. Wesley Strick's screenplay gets way too elaborate and cute with this stuff and the film must rely on many convenient coincidences to advance the storyline. But since this starts at about the midway point its too late to stop viewing now. Listening to the Strick's commentary track on the DVD it is clear that there was considerable meddling with the original story by producers, dumbing down the more intellectually compelling elements. Still little would have been lost and the overall credulity would have benefited by a less ambitious conspiracy, there was no reason for the parent's deaths to have been anything but an accident; it would have raised the film's IQ if the Glasses had been opportunists rather than conspirators. And the attempt at irony with the brake fluid would have worked better if Mr. Glass had been knocked out and put in his car; only to wake up as it is speeding down the road. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",The Glass House

OK, the story is quite good, but not extremely impressive and the acting made it feel like a mediocre TV-movie.It's the story about a young boy and his older sister who lose their wealthy parents in a tragic car accident. Because they don't really have any relatives to look after them and because the neighbors have always been such good friends of the family, they are placed under the neighbors' custody. But these friendly people aren't as good, friendly and nice as they have always believed. The wife is a drug addict and the man has a lot of debts. In fact, the only reason why they took the children in their own house is because they want to steal their inheritance.I really can't help it, but I always have the feeling that Leelee Sobieski only gets a part in some movies because of her looks. It's certainly not because of her great acting skills, because all I ever saw of her was far from convincing. I'm not saying it is awful, it's just not impressive. About all the other actors I can be brief as well, they did their job and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.

48,rivertam26,Entertaining guilty pleasure,7,20 April 2020,"I always been a fan of this film although if I being honest I don't think it's very good. It feels a little cliched and TV moviesh with sometimes overly dramatic performances from a normally solid cast. That being said the performances aren't bad and the movie is entertaining as a guilty pleasure. The film stars Leelee Sobieski (My First Mister). Remember she was hot for like fifteen minutes and kind of looked like Helen Hunt and mumbled a lot (I loved her of course). Well she is a moody teen who looses her parents to a car accident and goes to live with her younger brother to the Glasses, family friends. Played by a creepy Stellan Skarsgård (Thor) and a layered Diane Lane(Under the Tuscan Sun). Once arriving at their cold, stylish house things start to take a weird turn from the father seemingly hitting on her to drug abuse, hit men and her questioning whether her parents death was an accident. It's gorgeously filmed and quite suspenseful even though it all feels a bit familiar. Although overly entertaining the films pacing and focus feel off at times. It jumps between genres and plot points. Ultimately it's mostly successful because it indulges in the trashiest of its concept.BUDGET: $22M

50,mattymatt4ever,"Not the most solid thriller, but it delivers",7,18 January 2002,"""The Glass House"" is an exciting, fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping thrill ride that has its faults, but delivers the goods.  The credible performances help keep it running.  Stellan Skarsgard gives another truly great, and very creepy, performance.  Leelee Sobieski is great as well, proving again to be one of our young talents with incredible potential.  Diane Lane is good, though I wish her character could've been developed better--especially the subplot about her drug habit, which I think might've been tempered to keep the PG-13 rating.  The music, I felt, was overdone.  It seems like the director depended too much on the creepy music to help set the tone.  The score is well-done, but at some times didn't seem appropriate.  Partially because whenever you hear the music you know something eerie is about to happen, and it just made the sequences all the more predictable.The film has some of the usual cliches in the genre.  People popping out of dark corners, people hiding in obvious locations (i.e.:  under the bed) and not getting caught, people coming back to life after getting mutilated a couple thousand times.  But for some reason I really got into the film, and was able to look over those cliches and I actually didn't think much of them.  I guess there was a certain savviness to it, unlike a movie like ""What Lies Beneath"" where I burst out laughing during some scenes. 
This is not the smartest, most solid thriller ever made, but I had a real good time and I couldn't even hit the ""Pause"" button so I can go in the kitchen to grab a glass of water.  I was at the edge of my seat, anticipating what would happen next, so you can say this movie did its job...for the most part.  My score:  7 (out of 10)",The Glass House
51,jhclues,Memorable Performance by Leelee Sobieski,7,10 February 2002,"That there is nothing new under the sun is aptly demonstrated by this suspense/thriller which, though not too original, has some good moments and boasts a terrific performance by Leelee Sobieski.  All of which makes `The Glass House,' directed by Daniel Sackheim, worth a look.  It's a road you've no doubt been down before, and pretty early on you have a good idea of where it's going to wind up; but it's well crafted and delivered, and serves as a showcase for Sobieski, who is one of the finest young actors in the business today.	When their parents are killed in a car wreck, sixteen-year-old Ruby Baker (Sobieski) and her eleven-year-old brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan), find themselves under the guardianship of Terrence and Dr. Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), who are apparently well off financially, and have a rather nice house that sits on a cliff in Malibu, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  It's seemingly an idyll setting, but from the moment the children move in the climate within the household seems uncomfortable to all but Rhett.  Ruby senses something disconcerting with the arrangement, but there's not much she can do about it.  The executor of the Baker's will, Alvin Begleiter (Bruce Dern), advises Ruby that if it doesn't work out with Mr. and Mrs. Glass, she and Rhett would become wards of the court; not a happy prospect.  It quickly becomes apparent to Ruby, however, that there's more than meets the eye at play here, but to whom can she turn?  And therein lies the conundrum, because the answer is a resounding `no one.'  And especially in the wake of her parent's death, that's a tough thing for a sixteen-year-old to have to face.  What she doesn't know, as well, is that it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.	Director Sackheim does a good job of keeping up the tension in his film, but it could have been more effective had he employed a bit more subtlety and nuance.  And he has a troublesome affinity for camera shots through doors that are open just a crack, which allows one character (as well as the audience) to get a glimpse of another, as well as whatever is going on in the next room.  Initially, it works; but by the end of the film the impact it affords is diluted by overkill.  Things can only go bump in the night so many times, and you can only hold your breath so many times waiting for the eavesdropper to be discovered before it becomes second nature and ceases to be effective.  Even so, these are elements that can be overlooked, however, as Sackheim does keep it all moving along at a pace that sustains interest. But the unimaginative ending is something of a letdown, and just too pat to ultimately have much of an impact.	The saving grace of the film is clearly Sobieski, who as she matures is emerging as a cross between Helen Hunt and Jodie Foster, but with a talent and style uniquely her own.  In Ruby, she delivers a well rounded, three dimensional character which, in lesser hands, could easily have fallen into stereotype.  Ruby, however, is anything but.  This is a girl who comes from privilege (money, private school), and like any normal teenager has a certain disdain for her parents.  She knows her way around and is not beneath sneaking out into uncharted territory occasionally.  Sobieski makes her extremely believable, especially in her reactions to all that happens to and around her.  The scene in which she learns of her parent's death is played very well, very real, as are the scenes in which her suspicions become increasingly aroused.  And it's that level of realism she attains and brings to the character that carries the film.	Diane Lane, on the other hand, does not fare as well.  Her performance as Erin is passable, but fairly weak.  She fails to bring anything to the role to make her character unique; it's as if she never quite got a handle on who this person really is that she's trying to portray.  To be fair, she does have her moments, but overall, her work here is average, at best.	In Terry, Stellan Skarsgard creates a character who is not so much sinister as down right creepy.  He lacks the menace that would've made Ruby's situation scarier, but in retrospect, his character is more real because of it.  And he has a slimy leer that is so very telling in regards to who Terry is.  Some of his actions at times seem too `staged,' like when he reaches across Ruby in the car to buckle her seat belt, but that falls on Sackheim, and is certainly not a reflection on Skarsgard's performance, which is quite convincing.	The supporting cast includes Kathy Baker (Nancy Ryan), Michael O'Keefe (David Baker), Rita Wilson (Grace Baker), Chris Noth (Uncle Jack), Rachel Wilson (Hannah), Michael Paul Chan (Mr. Kim) and Carly Pope (Tasha).  Though not the greatest movie ever made, this one still has something to offer by way of atmosphere, some suspense, a few thrills and a decent (if not highly original) story.  But the main thing `The Glass House' has to offer is the memorable performance by Leelee Sobieski, who takes this film to a higher level single-handedly.  In the final analysis, it's pretty straightforward storytelling, and it is entertaining; for a thriller, you could do much worse.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.",The Glass House
52,TOMASBBloodhound,Worth a look on a slow night.,6,12 April 2003,"I just happened to catch this one on HBO tonight. I don't think it played in the theaters around here.Our story concerns the plight of a teenage girl and her little brother who are taken in by an up-scale couple after their parents are killed in a car accident. It doesn't take but a few minutes of screen time for our heroine (Sobieski) to come to the conclusion that their new guardians the Glass's are swine. Mr. Glass is a hot-shot car dealer who seems to owe a lot of cash to some underworld figures we never really learn that much about. Mrs. Glass is a drug addicted doctor played (in a fitfully distant manner) by Diane Lane. These two see the multi-million dollar trust funds of the kids to be a gold mine with which to keep their swanky Malibu house and a good supply of drugs in the medicine cabinet.No sooner do the kids move in then Sobieski starts formulating ideas on how to get herself and her brother the heck out of that house. She finds out time and time again that it's not always easy to outsmart the grown-ups. It's sometimes better to just sit back and let them destroy themselves.The film suffers from predictability and lack of credibility in the resolution of the conflict. That said, this is fiction so it shouldn't come as a big surprise if the film's creators were trying to keep the audience interested. There are a few tense and down right creepy moments sprinkled in, but the story as a whole never seems compelling.If nothing else, us guys can just sit back and enjoy seeing Leelee Sobieski for 106 uninterrupted minutes. I could probably think of a million worse ways to spend the time. That gal is so hot, she SMOKES!",The Glass House

54,MattyGibbs,Predictable but entertaining,7,1 June 2013,This is a fairly predictable but enjoyable thriller about 2 children who lose their parents and are adopted by their old neighbours who aren't all the initially seem. Whilst the plot is predictable there is enough intrigue and tense moments to keep your interest alive to the end. What really makes the film is the performances of the cast. Leelee Sobieski is excellent as the teenage girl in peril and there is excellent support from Stellan Starsgaard as the creepy neighbour. Bruce Dern also puts in a pleasing cameo appearance. The Glass House is nothing we haven't seen before a million times but if you are looking for a straightforward thriller to watch then this fits the bill.,The Glass House
55,Movie-12,"Involving story, smart performances, and effective atmosphere overcome a hole-laden script. *** (out of four)",7,9 October 2001,"THE GLASS HOUSE / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:	""The Glass House"" takes place in a beautiful, luxurious glass mansion complete with swimming pools, expensive artwork, high-tech security systems, and just about everything else. The wealthy occupants, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), become legal guardians of sixteen-year old Rudy (Leelee Sobieski) and eleven-year old Rhett (Trevor Morgan), when the kids' parents die in an automobile accident.	Terry and Erin were the best friends of the children's parents. They welcome their new guests into a world of wealth, glamour, and fun. Soon enough, however, Rudy notices strange quirks about these seemingly friendly folks. Is Terry secretly watching Rudy change her clothes? Is Erin addicted to prescription drugs, or is she a diabetic? Was her parents' death an accident, or a diabolical act of murder? Trust becomes as transparent as the glass surrounding this family. 	""The Glass House"" opened to mostly negative reviews, and not without probable cause. The setup provides an intriguing, imaginative situation, but everything happens so quickly the film forgets character introduction. First time-feature director Daniel Sackheim helms a hole-laden script by Wesley Strick that creates more plot holes than Swiss cheese. The film derives into involving material, but lacks the focus to play out these plot points.
	While Daniel Sackheim and Wesley Strick create a movie that lacks the timeliness and intelligence of a first-rate, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, ""The Glass House"" does offer good suspense and a plot that reveals itself with tantalizing sinister hints and increasing tension. It keeps us guessing, even if this diabolical fairy tale is anything but surprising.
	Leelee Sobieski has been in a lot of movies lately, and that's not a coincidence. She is a very talented actress, and she carries ""The Glass House"" through many plot miscalculations. Trevor Morgan, seen in ""Jurassic Park 3,"" adequately supports Sobieski's thorough, convincing performance. The very gifted Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard cover their sinister motives with pretentious personalities, but inject a mysterious, menacing undercurrent.	""The Glass House"" also provides a fresh, unique outlook on villains. Instead of causing trouble, these characters get themselves into trouble, which eventually makes them dangerous. Innovative, original twists like these are what make this movie worth a look. They say those who live in glass houses should not throw stones, but the villains in ""The Glass House"" do, and it's only a matter of time before everything shatters and breaks apart. It's quite involving watching these events come about, especially through a character driven story.",The Glass House
56,movieguy1021,The Glass House: 5/10,5,15 May 2003,"Are you tired of the already-clichéd genre of teen `horror-thriller' movies? Then skip The Glass House, yet another entry into this overgrowing yet popular series of movies that appeal to few, as the average critic's rating can show.Leelee Sobieski is Ruby Baker, a rebellious 16-year-old. Her brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) is a typical 11-year-old who loves video games. One day, however, their parents die in a car accident and they are sent to live with family friends, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgård and Diane Lane). They have a huge Beverly Hills house made out of-you guessed it-glass. However, Ruby and Rhett's parents left over $4 million in inheritance, and could the Glasses be after that money, or is it Ruby's overacting teenage imagination? You get three guesses and the first two don't count.One or two tense scenes and good acting by one person does not a good movie make. The predictability of it all is just stunning, and, in case you couldn't tell some things, director Daniel Sackheim (TV's Kingpin) decided to show every single detail so we could understand what was happening. It's to my understanding that most movies are supposed to have a little air of mystery, a little cliffhanger, something to keep you guessing, to keep you enthralled. No such luck here, since everything here was so thudding obvious, it wasn't any fun to watch.One of the only good parts of an otherwise degrading film was Skarsgård. He is a powerful leading man (incidentally, his performance in The Glass House is similar to his performance in the subpar, 1997 Norwegian Insomnia), and it showed here, except he wasn't the lead. One of those supposed up-and-coming stars that fade out after their one `hit' when they're praised for their acting when actually they overact is Sobieski. She seemed excited to play a lead, and tried hard, but it just didn't work. Lane has almost no screen time, making her subplot about being addicted to insulin worthless.There were one or two tense scenes, but unsuspenseful scenes of mediocrity surrounded them. I think that since all of it was so predictable, that really killed the suspense. If you want to see a worse teen horror-thriller, see Swimfan. But if you want a mediocre one, then see The Glass House.My rating: 5/10Rated PG-13 for sinister thematic elements, violence, drug content and language.",The Glass House

What woman would change her bra (or even consider it) in the middle of the hallway? So you share a room with your little brother. So what? First, any normal older sister would just kick her brother out of the room while she is changing and second, are we supposed to believe there's no bathroom in this place? It's just a small example but it's the same thing in many scenes. They took it a little too far, it's over the top and imho it's hurting the movie, not helping it.

The girls can identify with the protagonist, while the boys can ogle the her, as she has several exploitative scenes. It's a bit of a clichéd, predictable thriller, but I doubt that teens will be very critical of it.Most of the movie is a cat-and-mouse game between the protagonist and her guardians. Throughout the movie, all the adult authority figures are shown to be useless. It's a cheesy tactic used in most teen thrillers so that the teen protagonists actually have something to do besides wait for an adult to save them. For adults, it often ends up seeming a bit forced and difficult to believe.Several of the characters are introduced and never appear again, like they were completely forgotten. It makes you wonder why they were even introduced. Most perplexing is the uncle, who I would have thought would have custody of his niece and nephew -- but, no, the parents decided to give custody to their next door neighbors! Bizarre. And, when things start to get weird with the next door neighbors, not a single person suggests living with the uncle. It's like everyone forgot that there's even any relatives still alive.If you're a kid, this movie probably works a lot better.

It's got mature dialogues, nice sets, suspenseful atmospheres and good cast as well. Leelee Sobeski shines bright as the lead in this venture. Her portrayal of Ruby is just as reserved as it had to be. Stellan Skarsgard (Good Will Hunting) is an efficient actor. And this role is no exception.

This film was recommended to me by a friend, and I had never heard of it, so I could not really say what I was expecting. What I received though was a smart, intense, fun, excellently executed thriller with wonderful performances that entertains from beginning to end.Leelee Sobieski brings to her character, Ruby Baker, depth and likablity without even having to apply much effort to it. Stellan Skarsgård and Diane Lane are great as the Terrence and Erin Glass, and even Trevor Morgan gives a nice performances as Ruby's younger brother, Rhett Baker. The performances are part of what is effective with this movie. Everyone delivered their lines and completed scenes with finesse, even if they weren't Oscar worthy presentations and they created the atmosphere that the director was trying to set perfectly.The film is not boring at all and it's not mediocre as a lot of reviews suggest. It has a nice, suspenseful build up and the material, while the gist is a bit overused, is fresh in it's own way. Who says an unoriginal plot has to bad? Is that a written rule? The plot is simply marvelous in this film, if you ask me. I enjoyed so much seeing how the twist in the film starts to slowly unravel piece by piece, because I liked the characters and was interested in the story from the get go. The movie almost trips on it's own feet a couple of times, but nothing seriously major that is worth noting keeps you from enjoying the fun and satisfaction the film brings. I even was extremely fond of the setting, and for those of you who say it's an overrated pun with the Glasses living in a house mostly made of glass, there are horror classics throughout history that work off puns much cornier, and The Glass House does it very well, stop complaining.In any matter, as I have said, The Glass House is non-stop fun and excitement from beginning to end with delightful and even memorable performances (i.e.: Leelee Sobieski, who indeed gives the finest performance of all, and probably the finest of her career in general), an intense and realistic atmosphere, relentless build up and a twist that I honestly could not see coming.

Okay, near the ending it was getting a little bit interesting but then the very end was so stupid...*** SPOILER: JUST ABOUT THE ENDING *** (for those of you who saw it, i'm sure you'll agree with me)okay, Terry Glass comes back alive after falling off the cliff and takes the police's gun, when Ruby steps on the gas and tries to run over Terry, he shoots his gun right before he gets run over and you even see the bullet mark on the front glass of the car but after you see Terry die you see Ruby and her brother come out of the car fine, not even a single drop of blood! Now what is up with that!? A bunch of people in the theater was laughing at the ending it was so fake... and we laughed even more when the another cop shows up again and takes the kids...*** END OF SPOILING ***This movie could of been better, the parents were weak! not that interesting, average movieOverall Rating: 5.5/10",The Glass House

It was the same-old, ho-hum, stuff that we have all seen a million times before, just retreaded with the ""new, hot actress of the moment (Leelee Sobieski.)""There is only, as near as I can tell, one reason to see this movie: Leelee shows off more of her body. That's it.Don't get me wrong, she's a great actress, with potential and an already impressive resume, but this film is really, really, beneath her. A few more roles like Joan of Arc and she'll be at the tops of her craft; a few more like this, and she'll be a Helen Hunt lookalike--and utterly forgettable.Leelee, do yourself a favor, don't make more films like this one, trust me.So, if you want to see Leelee cleavage, then line up and watch; but if you want a story that is compelling and worth your money, then go watch something else.",The Glass House

I generally agree with the other ratings here, but I think the movie isn't that bad again. It has its thrilling sequences, the story is okay, a bit suspense, and the end is also okay. The acting is a point of criticism, right. Trevor Morgan was shallow as a character, which wasn't his fault but due to a bleak script. There could have been much more accomplished by a better director, as the story itself has some quality. The vicious couple could have been portrayed more credible as well. The tension and the level of suspense could have been higher too. Generally not too good and hardly agreeable.",The Glass House

In fact, that's pretty much what I thought while watching this movie. Leelee Sobieski is the best part of the cast, though she isn't very good. Diane Lane gives a forgettable performance as one of Sobieski's guardians who as usual has something to hide, as does her husband Terry (Stellan Skarsgard, ""Ronin"" and ""Deep Blue Sea""). The plot is fairly, wait make that, very predictable, there are no surprises and a lot of the cast seems to be just going through the motions, without giving much effort. ""The Glass House"" isn't the worst film this year, that title belongs to movies like, ""Freddy Got Fingered,"" ""Monkeybone,"" ""Rat Race,"" ""Ghosts of Mars"" and the almighty stinker in 2001, ""Tomb Raider.""

81,Juni78ukr,Above average thriller/drama,6,19 September 2003,"I watched Glass House tonight and found it reasonably good and better than I expected. The story is about two young kids who after tragic death of their parents live with family friends. All looks good for Ruby and Rhett but after some time the elder sister begin to notice some strange things about their careful adoptive parents, while her younger brother notices nothing. Such new discoveries scared her and she begins to realize that something is wrong in their relations. The movie is dark and become even frightened at parts though as well as most of modern thrillers it suffered from predictability of the story. Despite that the movie provides some suspense to keep your attention to the screen and be worried about characters, which development is very good for such a movie, all characters look quite real and impressive. Also it's worth to mention pretty nice performances of Leelee Sobieski and Stellan Sarsgaard, who is very good in his dark character.My grade 6.8 out of 10",The Glass House

84,SamRag,Watched it because my wife demanded it!,7,12 August 2002,"I was surprised by this one, after having read some of the comments about it.  My wife had insisted on several occasions to rent it, but I had managed to avoid it until now.  The reason being that I'm not a great fan of startle-you-scenes' movies, where story line comes second to all possible means to startle the audience out of their shoes (which I believe is a the wrong way in creating good horror/thriller action movies).  The Glass House is however not one of these, and I suspect that is one of the reason some people have given it slack reviews.  Here they seem to keep to more realistic theme, with characters re-acting in intelligent manner, instead of some idiots you often see in horror/thriller films.  The interesting thing was that the girl in the movie suspected from the start that something was wrong, and tried to solve the situation.  The authorities became part of the picture from the start, instead of the usual stupidity that someone evil' resides in position of authority, denying the victim any help.  The Glass couple were a bit unusual, though not overdoing it, and we can follow how they slip into their own nightmarish madness.  Especially good was the scene were Mr. Glass is asking for a loan at a bank, displaying how, in fact, he was just a regular man.  So all in all, this was just enough tension, in rather realistic environment, with surprisingly good acting all around. 7/10",The Glass House
85,Brian B-2,Deserves a look,7,15 September 2002,"I am not as harsh on this movie as most. LeiLee Sobieski establishs herself as a top young actress. That alone ought to be worth the watching, just so when she wins her Oscar you can say you saw her first great role. Stellan Skarsgård is exquisite as the creepy Mr. Glass, humanizing what could be a cardboard character. Diane Lane is convincing playing against type- proof that she too can really act. too bad she isn't given more character to work with.My emotional response was anger at the abuse, not fear or terror - the obviousness of the outcome was apparent early, the few ""twists"" minor and uninteresting. The suspense never built. It got intense ( but not terribly so) too fast, and then actually let the tension dissipate several notches. A good thriller has maximum tension at the climax. This movie fails there.The plot is swiss cheese ( full of holes).Almost totally incoherent, and totally unrealistic. Bruce Dern, Kathy Baker and Chris Noth sleepwalk through supporting parts. Don't they have better ways to make money than serving as plot devices?",The Glass House

87,Nocgirl72,Another BIG stinker from LeeLee,3,12 January 2002,"I don't know why I bother with any films by LeeLee Sobieski. Why does this supposedly talented up and coming actress continue to act in bombs? ""Deep Impact"" was horrible and nothing but an overhyped advertising campaign. ""Here on Earth"" was a poorly written pathetic piece of garbage. Now ""The Glass House""-a wanna-be thriller full of lackluster writing, cliches, and more plot holes than I can count. The house this movie was filmed in was beautiful but the story line was nothing more than lame. So predictable too.
LeeLee plays Ruby Baker, a 16 year old who's parents were killed in a car accident. Her and her 11 year old brother Rhett move in with friends of the family, Mr and Mrs. Glass, who own a glass company, and hence, live in a Glass house. Ruby becomes suspicious of the Glass's involvement in her parents death and tries to play superhero and rescue herself and her little brother from the twisted couple that is now their guardians. Don't expect much excitement or any innovative plot twists-there aren't any.

88,bhattrell,"(8/10) ""Great thriller if slightly longer. Not a horror though"".",8,7 January 2018,"The Glass house movie review (8/10) ""Great thriller if slightly longer. Not a horror though"".The Glass house challenges the idea that individuals always want to assist those in need of help. It comes with multiple surprises and settings, and an action packed storyline.
The constant theme throughout is almost like dark action. It is certainly not a horror, but does earn it's reputation well as a thriller.The characters are well played with the multitude of emotions, actions and health states they experience. It takes some real skill to act with this level of diversity.Clearly, the casting team did a good job. As for the movie itself, not bad at all. Being in the haunted house genre, I was expecting a horror though, which I didn't get. If horror was to emerge in the already action packed house, it would have made the interesting storyline great, and enhance the sinister vibes already present.The music worked well throughout, with dramatic sounds used to emphasise particularly shocking events. These crescendo cues, were not worn out however, so the film worked well to raise tension.Aswell as the darkness, the initial expectation of forthcoming positivity, helps the contrast. The setting is far from what you'd expect and darkness is not only restricted to the night. This is quite rare in horror films.With themes of broken relationships, attraction, abuse, bereavement, empathy and sibling love, the film provides enough emotional variety to really get, and keep the viewer engaged. No short change is present in the movie. With some better special effects and fright techniques though, this could be raised to a truly chilling level.As it stands currently it is still a striking, varied and engaging thriller, with darker undertones throughout. The storyline is not idiotproofed, yet isn't rocket science either, so suits me well.I am tempted to watch again and would recommend as a thriller. I give it 8.5/10 as a thriller since it's a little long for a truly outstanding movie. Unfortunately though, I can only give it a 7/10 as a horror, since the effects and tension weren't sufficient.",The Glass House
89,unbend_5440,Better than most Thrillers,6,16 September 2001,"The Glass House is in no way a ground breaking or innovative movie. And even though it has the plot of a cheesy TV movie, it's surprisingly good. A very decent thriller. The director, Daniel Sackheim, really pulls off the tension factor for the film. It makes you nervous watching it, even though any person in the world knows how movies like this end. And the good thing is that the tension is well balance through the whole 2 hours. This movie is made by great performances, well directed action, a cool Darth Maul poster on a wall, and a one line reference to Jurassic Park III.

93,femaleanimefan,Not What I Expected,6,17 July 2007,"The Glass House is not what I expected it to be. I thought it would be a horror film about a family who moves into a glass house and then a killer watches them through a window and goes on a killing spree for no reason. That idea is very stereotypical. But I rented it anyways because I thought it would be like any other horror film: cheesy, stupid, and fun! But my plot guess was completely off. The real plot is totally different. The plot focuses on 16 year old Ruby Baker(Leelee Sobieski), whose parents, Dave and Grace, just recently died in a car accident. So her and her game obsessed brother, Rhett move in with their neighbors, Erin(Diane Lane) and Terry Glass(Stellan Skarsgård). They are all happy and everything is fine. But as things change, Ruby gets suspicious that Erin and Terry aren't all sweet and kind. She talks to a guidance counselor, Alvin Begleiter(Bruce Dem) and finds out that their parents left them 4 million dollars. Things get very strange in the house. Erin is seen injecting herself, Ruby thinks Terry was trying to rape her, and there are a lot of suspicious phone calls.ReviewActing: 7/10. The acting was all right throughout the film. Leelee Sobieski was a nice fit for the part of Ruby. Her acting was pretty good seeing this movie was more of a drama film than a thriller. Other cast members, Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgård were pretty good but they weren't at their best. The one performance that stands out was Trevor Morgan's character. He played Rhett and he played him well. Overall the acting was decent.Story: 6/10. The story wasn't bad. But the whole car accident scenario has been used before. But I think it is an interesting twist on it and the story won't be what you think.Entertaining: 7/10. This movie wasn't the most entertaining thriller I have ever seen. It was more of a drama than a thriller because it let more dramatic than thrilling scenes in the film. Some of it could be boring while some of it was suspenseful.Humor: 3/10. Well, it wasn't funny. But that's okay. It wasn't supposed to be funny. It was meant to be about Ruby and Rhett's time with Glasses and all their problems. So humor wasn't really necessary.Pros of The Film -It was interesting. -It showed Ruby's troubles and grief after her parent's deaths very well. -Rhett was awesome. -The acting was above averageCons of the Film -A bit too long -Boring sometimesOverall I thought the film was enjoyable and a little corny, but fun none the less. And a message for guys, if you want your girlfriend to hug your arm in fright while watching a horror film, I don't recommend the Glass House because it is more of a drama then a horror. I would recommend the new horror flick, 1408. That one is scary. But watch this film for a little fun. This film is one of those ""it's so bad it's good"" movies.6/10",The Glass House

Leelee Sobieski and her younger brother are orphaned and are taken in by their neighbors, friends of their late parents.  Best of all is Stellan Skarsgard playing Sobieki's shady new guardian.  Diane Lane adds a humanistic (though tragic) touch, while solid character actors Chris Noth and Kathy Baker pop up and help move this along. Only Bruce Dern is wasted, in a role that is written so heavy-handedly you are practically relieved when his character dies near the end.  Overall you could do a lot worse at the video store.

Simply put, `The Glass House' is awful, and a complete waste of time.  1 STAR OUT OF 5.",The Glass House

The gangsters stab the lawyer, take off with Mr Glass and the kids again don't call 911, they just wander off down the road in their PJ's until a cop pulls over to see if they need any help, and some how Mr Glass has survived the car being flattened and they then have to run him over.

DIANE LANE (The Perfect Storm, Judge Dredd) is undoubtedly one of the most talented and beautiful actresses in Hollywood and her performance, in a supporting role here, is sheer class. STELLAN SKARSGAARD (Deep Blue Sea, Ronin) is a little O.T.T. but he conveys creepiness really well, and LEELEE SOBIESKI (Eyes Wide Shut, Deep Impact) makes a fine and appealing heroine. I loved the stylistic cool blue tint that the film had as well. A very slick and enthralling piece of escapist entertainment. 8/10.",The Glass House

First of all, it is PG-13, and I knew that it was probably aiming at teenage girls. To my surprise it wasn't bad at all.  It had really good acting, and the guy who played Terry Glass was awesome.  The scenery and house were both awesome, yet sort of creepy.  See it if your girlfriend or date drags you to it, and put up a fight, so that you can pick the next movie.

Leelee Sobieski and Stellan Skarsgard's best performances to date. It is a some-what normal story (it's not like aliens are invading Earth or there's a haunted mental ward or something).I guess I do have a couple of complaints, though. I couldn't figure out why they wouldn't run away from school or call somebody from a safe phone. But if they did that there wouldn't be much of film. But in several scenes, even though I know what's going to happen I jump every time! The perfect thriller! 9/10",The Glass House

Leelee Sobieski gave an excellent performance as the cynical teenager - Ruby Baker, not only that but the rest of the supporting actors were good in their roles. Though that's where the good stuff ends. For a thriller, there were very few thrills. The story was messy and some could argue that it was rather hole-ridden. If it wasn't for the outstanding performances by the cast, this movie could have been truly awful. Instead it gets a ""below average""4/10",The Glass House

123,dan_in_denver,I have seen worse.. AND better!,7,10 September 2002,"I happened to catch this movie on cable the other day, and my favorite part of the movie was that I never paid theater prices to see it. The story does suffer from too many holes in the plot, but somehow those holes don't completely sink the boat. There are more convolutions in the plot than twists at contortionist's convention, and sometimes these twists strained the suspension of belief that is required to get through the rest of the movie. The story centers two children who are sent to live with the Glasses who were friends of thier parents after those parents are killed in an automobile accident. Turns out the parents had quite a nest egg stored away, and soon the motivations of everyone involved begin to smother the rest of the story. Its a typical suspense movie that lacks many of the essential elements that would other wise make it truly suspenseful. The best thing in the movie is 20 year old Leelee Sobieski who I am sure will be gracing the screen for sometime to come. This is an ok movie for a rainy Saturday afternoon, but if its not raining, take a walk instead.. you will enjoy it more!! :O)",The Glass House

""The Glass House"" has the air of something that has been sitting on the shelf for a while and is now being ""snuck"" into theatres.  The script has so many holes in it, it could pass for Swiss cheese.  The dialogue is pretty cheesy as well. Unfortunately, some very talented people get wasted here.  Leelee Sobieski, normally an impressive young talent, plays one note here -- no, not even one note, one-half.  Stellan Skarsgaard's American accent impresses, if not his acting, and Diane Lane seems to be in despair. Kathy Baker looks unrecognizable from the leading lady of ""Picket Fences,"" but Trevor Morgan has some nice moments as Sobieski's younger sibling. I'd say ""wait for the video"" but it won't even be worth it then.",The Glass House
125,xgros,Average thriller movie for an average audience.,4,26 January 2002,An interesting idea and well played movie but the plot can be discovered by any non-Sherlock Holmes viewer 20 minutes after the movie starts. We wait desperately during the remaining part of the movie to see how the baddy will be killed. Not many surprises just a box-standard American movie where the teenagers orphans avenge their parents' death in a more or less expected manner.Filming and directing are fine but the credibility of the actors varies quite a lot and there is nothing really exceptional in the scenario.If you have nothing to do and have some time to kill this movie may be worth watching. Otherwise grab a book !,The Glass House

127,LoveHurts01,"I don't know why, but...",10,11 October 2001,"I don't know why, but The Glass House was one of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen! There were certain parts where I was about to scream! It was very intense and the atmosphere and quick pace really kept it up. The best features of this movie are:1) The Actors: Leelee Sobieski gives a great performance as a girl who realizes that her new guardians are not what they initially appeared to be. The rest of the stellar cast really did an awesome job.2) The Production Design: The setting of the glass house is so menacing, it is basically a character on its own.AND3) The Music Score: Christopher Young produced the most creepy score I've ever heard in my entire life! I was impressed with his work on Urban Legend, but this music is so creepy, that it can scare you without seeing the movie!All in all, The Glass House is well-worth the money. I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to get thrilled beyond belief!",The Glass House
128,mashadsk,Just a usual thriller,6,28 January 2007,"I have to confess, that I watched this movie only because of Diane Lane, who I recently admire. And I didn't regret. I think everybody who's interested can read the plot, so I won't stop telling what's the movie about.From the very beginning it's clear, that The Glass (especially Diane Lane, probably it's because of make-up or probably it's her play) are not good people, and it's really surprising that Rudy - an orphaned girl doesn't come to Chicago with her uncle Jack (Mr. Big from Sex and the City), but instead goes with the Glass to their glass house in Malibu.The house is what scares you in this movie most. It seems to be big and light and friendly from the first glance (it's made mainly of glass and similar material), but at night it becomes grave and dangerous. I think it's worth looking, and very unusual. It doesn't scare you with things like strange and scary noises, or sudden appearances etc. There's only lighting.Anyway being a quite interesting and suspicious thriller till the third quarter, when you try to guess the motives of The Glass' behavior, this movie just goes to the clichéd Hollywood lame, with maniacs arising from dead for the fourth time in a row and trying to kill you the main characters... It spoiled everything.I still say it's 6 of 10 because of Diane Lane's play, the house and quite interesting plot for the first 3 quarters of the movie.",The Glass House

It looked really good in the commercials and plus it has lelee sobieski in it. The movie ended up being entertaining,but not the movie I expected. It has its moments of suspense,but not enough to say it was an excellent thriller. Everyone in the movie had a good performance, which is a plus to keep you entertained for an hour and 45 minutes. The one thing I did like a lot was that lelee sobieski's character (ruby)was really a strong person and didn't take crap from anyone. She knew how to stand up for herself and care for her younger brother. My advice is wait for video.",The Glass House
130,Natsu21,Had potential but fell flat,3,9 August 2013,"I started off watching this movie with generally high hopes of it being a decent film. Very quickly though it became apparent it wasn't. It was just so clichéd and boring. Also a lot of stuff happening in the film didn't make sense. For starters when Ruby goes and sees the lawyer and tells him about all the problems she is having at the Glass home, he goes on about how if she doesn't stay with them she and her brother become wards of the state. This does not make sense since Ruby and her brother have an uncle who would be more than happy to take them in they set this up right at the start of the movie. the lawyer does send a social worker to check out the house though, but at the end of the movie you find out he had warned Mr Glass about her coming. Last time I checked isn't breaking attorney client privilege illegal? or at least will get you disbarred? Also in the movie you find out Mr Glass killed the parents of the children, so he could get guardianship of the kids and have access to their 4 million dollar trust fund. This really doesn't make sense when you consider that the parents moved away the Glass's 10 years ago, so we are meant to believe that in 10 years time the Bakers (the parents) never updated their will? Mr Glass plan all rested on him and his wife still being the legal guardians of the kids when their parents died. In the end it was just a boring movie with lots of plot holes and a lot of moments that didn't make sense.",The Glass House

I felt like the movie really put me in the characters' shoes, and I found myself getting very involved in the film. I found the story interesting, Leelee Sobieski to be intriguingly fantastic, and the ""guardians"" to be absolutely intimidating and frightening. I simply loved how the plot slowly developed, revealing just how terrible a plan the Glasses were creating. Maybe I'm just easily pleased, but I thought this film was a real winner in my opinion.

All the time I was watching this, I was on the edge of my seat --- waiting to get out of the movie theater. The Glass House was so dull and painfully boring to watch, especially with Leelee Sobieski sleepwalking through her lines. Out of the entire hour and forty minutes of film, I think I may have seen her change her facial expression TWICE. The rest of the cast didn't factor much into my enjoyment of the film, either. Perhaps the director forgot the importance of plot twists in a suspense thriller, as well. If you expected something to happen, there was a nine out of eleven chance that it would.

135,stargirl42792,"""Glass House"" Might Shatter",6,18 June 2005,"Just like Jello, this movie is enjoyable, bouncy, entertainment, with no real nutritional value or taste.The plot isn't exactly original. It starts when a couple, the Bakers, die, leaving behind a decent-sized fortune to their kids, Ruby and Rhett. After their death, the kids are adopted by another couple. (They don't exactly live in a glass house. Just a nice mansion with lots of windows.) At first, the couple seem like they're trying to make the kids comfortable at home. However, after awile, the kids start to suspect that their new parents are after their inheritance.The script is great, as well as the acting. Leelee Sobieski, playing Ruby, steals every scene, expressing strength and vulnerability. And Trevor Morgan (Rhett) displays some sparks of talent. But it all feels so clichéd'. The plot has been used a million times before, and there are too many dramatic action scenes. It also leaves you wondering something: Why would two adults that rich want to kill two teenagers just for some extra cash?The creators of this film weren't too creative, but the cast covers it up decent enough.

There is the music; always tinkling along with a pretty ominous piano sound. Then it's the long looks from the actors, always suspecting something from the first moment. I bet if the music was more cheerful and light, i would think this was a really funny comedy. In fact, in the beginning of the movie i was so affected by nothing except sneaky mood music, that i actually thought this could come up to something good. And even if this movie not consistently was a screwup, there sure wasn't much to look forward to. There more the movie advanced, the more stupid it looked.

It's about a girl, Ruby, whose parents mysteriously die one night while her and her girlfriends are out partying. She goes to stay with her parents best friends and neighbors during her childhood, the Glasses, in a huge house in the country. They are filthy rich, and so is Ruby and her brother, Rhett. They inherited $4 Million dollars in life insurance money.But things start to get strange in the Glass house...Mr. Glass appears to be making moves on her, Mrs. Glass is found one night laying on the floor with a needle stuck in her arm - the housekeeper is fired simply for driving Ruby to talk to a childwelfare inspector. The plot keeps on building and building, until finally it reaches a huge climax that makes you realize there are no good or bad guys in this movie - everyone's a victim.
And that also includes the audience. A tragic victim to some very horrible acting. Leelee Sobieski pulls a mediore performance of Ruby. Diane Lane's portrayal of Mrs. Glass is so fake it isn't even funny - she makes Intro to Drama students look like superstars. And Trevor Morgan.....the one that played Ruby's little brother....lets just say his young acting career is off to a very, very bad start.The plot is extraoridnary, but they could have used some BETTER ACTORS.",The Glass House

While I enjoy films that have more of a plot or a more surprising ending than this one, I found myself on the edge of the couch several times. I added this film to my collection because of the following reasons. The beauty of the house itself was enjoyable and I found it be a nice little thriller with exciting scenes that made me jump. While the acting wasn't anything to write home about, it wasn't bad. I found the film to have a little of the Alfred Hickcock type of suspense.

160,grounder-1,wait five years til it is on WTBS in the middle of a Saturday afternoon,1,15 September 2001,"This is one of those movies that 5 years from now you will see on WTBS in the middle of a rainy Saturday afternoon and you will think, ""hum, I don't remember that one"".  Leelee was good.  Not many strong female parts out in the movie world for young women.  She made the most of a predictable script and a bad back from the presumed dead villain scene.  Her little brother, Rhett, was played by the same kid that played Scott Anspaugh for 5 episodes of ER.  They basically had the only two good parts in the movie.  It is a good diversion from the worlds events and served its purpose to kill 2 hours during tropical storm Gabrielle.Leelee will likely win awards in the next 5 years but not for this one.",The Glass House
161,quietlain64,"it was a good idea, but plot seemed stretched",3,16 September 2001,"the glass house is a suspense thriller that seemed like a good idea. the plot was stretched out so far you could see what was going to happen. the movie didn't hold my attention as much as i thought it would, it seemed like it should have been shorter but was filled with a lot of unneeded scenes. you could see through this movie almost as much as the glass house. all in all, i rate it a 3. i mostly laughed at the absurdness of some of the scenes.",The Glass House
162,leep1553,Predictable but good,7,17 September 2001,"I was taken by the trailer whilst visiting my parents who live in the US so I headed down to take a look.I found the film enjoyable although most of the plot twists were predictable.  It made me think about what anyone could do faced with a similar situation and the lack of belief in kids when faced with an opposing adult view.For the guys though, the scene where Leelee Sobrieski (needlessly) goes swimming at night in the smallest bikini I've seen, is well worth the visit.Shallow, but true.",The Glass House
163,shumacher,Crayola job on fine-tip concept.,3,22 February 2002,"I had very high hopes for this movie. Great trailers, great people, why not? Sadly, most of the film's excitement is shown on the trailer. What little is left out of the trailer would have given the movie away. About 70% of the film's length is spent on awkwardness. I think it was supposed to be something besides awkward, like suspenseful, but sadly, the strongest emotion the film could stir in me was mild annoyance. So much so, I had to stop the film three times to go do something else. I came back because I /wanted/ it to be good. I'd skip this one, unless it appears on TV.",The Glass House

I loved the movie and I didn't even get bored at all throughtout the whole movie! I hope everyone gets to see this movie, you won't be dissapointed! The movie is thrilling, creepy, and a has great action stunts at the end!IGNORE THEM BAD COMMENTS!!!!",The Glass House
165,packerbuzz99,"The movie itself is almost awful, but any red-blooded male that",6,17 February 2002,"wants to see more of Leelee has got to check it out.  She is awesome to the nth degree.  No nudity, but enough low-cut and swimsuit to make it worthwhile.  Truly a sight for sore eyes and makes you yearning for more. One thing for sure, the setting of the house is superb.  If it hadn't been raining for almost the length of the movie it would have been nicer.",The Glass House
166,mddock58,Perception is a matter of the point of view,7,18 April 2002,"This movie will not be a classic, although it works the plot through Ruby's eyes well. The cinematography is generally worked well, though questions of continuity are evident. I enjoyed the movie and had no problem getting into the characters. The writer and director did a fairly good job in playing the good/bad question with the cast. As an outsider (Movie Watcher) we tend to expect what the possibilities of the plot will be and when it hits us we say it was no surprise. This is because so many movies show our basic instincts and responses. I found the movie to be frighteningly real to what is possible by the twisted mind.",The Glass House
167,mothman14,"Good, could have been great.",7,11 September 2002,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. I think that people are right when they say that this movie isn't all that it could be. The acting is great, the plot is pretty good but this doesn't feel like a complete movie. Most of it comes from the fact that this movie first ran near 3 hours. Then they cut it down to a small hour and forty minutes. I think that a lot of substance was lost due to the fact that the audience would get bored. I'd rather sit through a slow movie that is good than a slow movie that is okay. They should have turned it into a mini-series on TV then release it on DVD to get the budget back. So in the end it's a good movie that I enjoy watching over and over again. 7/10",The Glass House
