0,MartinHafer,"I just didn't care one bit about the characters...not one teeny, tiny bit.",4,4 August 2012,"The title character is a nasty and self-absorbed guy who is magically transported from the American Southwest in 1881 to Mars...yes Mars. Once there, he meets lots of strange creatures and is caught up in a huge war--a war orchestrated by some very odd bald guys (the Therns) who seem to get off on manipulating planets--though exactly why is rather vague. Can a mere human somehow change the tide of an entire planet...especially when it isn't his own? ""John Carter"" made $170,000,000....yet lost SIGNIFICANT money. This alone should give you some idea why the movie just isn't very good. Despite having mostly unknown actors who probably cost very little to cast, the film cost a staggering $250,000,000! Why? Because it's ALL special effects...ALL. There apparently was no room for interesting characters, a coherent back story or fun. Rarely has a piece of entertainment been so non-entertaining! It appears as if the film is trying to be another Avatar..but without the substance or decent characters. All it had going for it was a nice ending but overall, a misguided and dull film from start to nearly finish. How could they have made it better? Not push so many characters into the film and stretch it out to more than one film--and allowing the characters to develop and have some substance. As it was, they came and went quickly and I just didn't care. Oh well,...at least I liked Woola the 'dog' and the Therns...now they were interesting characters! But they along with nice special effects aren't enough reason to see this movie.",John Carter
1,TheLittleSongbird,Nowhere near the disaster that it has been reputed to be,7,10 August 2014,"Of course John Carter is a long way from flawless, but it is also not that bad but you wouldn't think so looking at its box office failure, its reputation and also how terribly marketed it was. Sure the plot is thin as ice in places with scenes that go on for far longer than they needed to, and it is also predictable and with the odd convoluted part, with the many logical lapses not helping in its favour. Particularly at the end, which gave off a sense that the film didn't know how to end itself. The script is uneven too, a fair bit of it is actually quite intelligently handled with some entertainment and suspense but there are other points where the dialogue does make one cringe and you do wish you learnt more about the characters and that the romance wasn't so disjointed and forced. John Carter however does look incredible, the backdrops and scenery are bursting with colour and detail and don't look fake at all and the special effects are equally impressive and not cartoony at all, they are at least well modelled and move easily. Michael Giaccino's music score is outstanding being full of bombastic energy and sweeping intensity, doing all that while fitting with the action and not swamping it. There is plenty of action and it is action that is a feast for the eyes and choreographically is very well-executed, the best of them dazzlingly so. Of the characters, the most enjoyable one was Woola, a very cute and very funny dog creature- the CGI for the character is very well done and some of the best of the film actually- that children and adults alike will take a shine to. Andrew Stanton, considering that his field is more in animation and that the crew for John Carter is so huge, had a very daunting task and does so bravely, though with the odd understandable occasion where he seemed out of sorts with the live actors. While the story may not be the greatest, John Carter shouldn't be taken too seriously, it was intended to be harmless family fun and is so and it has an earnest, old-fashioned approach that works and in keeping with the source material. The performances are not bad at all, Taylor Kitsch does start off for a while ill at ease and over-serious but once he relaxes he does make for a likable hero. Lynn Collins is both feisty and human, and the supporting cast all make an effort to make much of little with Willem Dafoe, Mark Strong(in a role that suits him to a tee) and Ciaron Hinds being the most successful. In conclusion, not flawless by any stretch of the imagination but far from a disaster either. 7/10 Bethany Cox",John Carter
2,bkoganbing,When a Barsoom girl meets a Jasoom boy,8,15 June 2012,"Edgar Rice Burroughs best known as the creator of Tarzan did a whole lot of work that stirred the imagination of readers for generation. I'm glad it took 100 years for this story to make it the big screen. The age of computer graphics was the right one for this story to be filmed.In fact Edgar as a young man is a peripheral character in the film if not the book. He's summoned to his uncle John Carter's home and arrives on time for his demise. As per Carter's instructions he's given a journal to read and it's the account of an amazing adventure where Carter as a disillusioned Confederate veteran is teleported to Mars where he gets involved in the local feuding between humanoids and other beings.Taylor Kitsch plays the title role and is the perfect conception of a pulp fiction hero of the novels written circa 1912. I have to congratulate Burroughs if for no other reasons than he realized that aliens on a different planet would not be calling their world by a deity's name from one of the Earth's ancient culture. They are called Barsoom and they refer to our planet as Jasoom.And as a representative from Jasoom, Kitsch gets involved in what could be the first interplanetary romance with a Barsoom girl. A princess even. But some supernatural beings called Thurns seem to be pulling strings and these Thurns are not like angels from our Christian religion, they're not benign beings at all. They exact a price for Kitch upsetting some plans they had. I did so love the Woola, a giant Marsworm who has a lovable quality and attaches himself to Kitsch.The film did not really do that good for the size of its budget. That's sad because it's a fine piece of work of the imagination and a credit to the man who had a limitless imagination, Edgar Rice Burroughs.",John Carter
3,Leofwine_draca,Too reliant on CGI,5,7 January 2015,"I consider myself a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs, being interested in the whole early 20th century pulp fiction scene as a whole, so I admit my interest was piqued when I heard about this adaptation of one of the author's less well-known tales. The resultant film was a massive flop for Disney, so how would it hold up once all the fuss had died down?The truth is that, like so many Hollywood blockbusters today, JOHN CARTER is too reliant on CGI effects for its own good. Barely a scene goes by without huge crowds of aliens, or CGI supporting creations, or CGI city scapes, or CGI spaceships. It's all very George Lucas and it saps the spectacle from the production so that after 10 minutes you're no longer impressed; instead, it feels monotonous.It's a shame, because there's a good story in here waiting to get out, and the cast can't be bettered (except for in one crucial place). One of the producers must have been a fan of TV's ROME because we get Ciaran Hinds and James Purefoy teaming up once more, along with a Polly Walker voice-over. Elsewhere there's the dependable Dominic West and Mark Strong as villains, so it's mainly British talent and the performances are surprisingly decent considering the genre.A shame, then, that the wooden and entirely charisma-free Taylor Kitsch nabbed the leading role; this guy is one of the most soulless in the whole of Hollywood and, to be blunt, I hated him throughout. It's a shame, because his presence really dragged my enjoyment of the film down, along with all the excess, post-STAR WARS baggage of the effects work. It's not entirely without merit - here and there are some great set-pieces and an engaging storyline - but you have to work hard to spot them.",John Carter
4,SnoopyStyle,"OK watch, big time $ flop",6,28 August 2013,"John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is a Civil War veteran. It's 1868. He's trying to live a normal life. While escaping capture, he runs into some Indians. There's a gunfight and he seeks refuge in a cave. While there, he encounters someone who is holding some kind of medallion. When Carter touches it, he is transported to Mars. There he encounters Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) who is in need of a savior.This is the big $$$ flop of 2012. Not quite 'Heaven's Gate' but it still hurt. It's not that terrible. There are some big action. The start is too slow and it seem to be more of a serial rather than a three act story. Taylor is passable as a lead. This is a solid sci-fi action adventure but nothing especially compelling.",John Carter
5,claudio_carvalho,Underrated Sci-Fi Film,9,3 June 2012,"Edgar Rice Burroughs, who is the nephew of the rebel widower veteran of the Civil War and gold hunter John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), has to attend the funeral of his uncle after his sudden death. He receives from John Carter's attorney his diary and weird instructions to be followed, and Edgar immediately starts reading the journal.In 1868, the Colonel Powell tries to force John Carter to join the army to fight against the Apache and arrests him. However, John Carter escapes and Powell (Bryan Cranston) chases him. They are attacked by the Apache and they hide in a cave. They are surprised by a Thern and John Carter kills him, and the alien's medallion transports John Carter to Mars. John has the ability to jump high and has his strength increased due to the gravity of Mars. However, he is captured by the Tharks and becomes their prisoner. He learns that Mars, called Barsoon, has been in war for thousand of years between the Helium and Zodanga, and this war is destructing the planet. The evil leader of Zodanga, Sab Than (Dominic West), has received a powerful weapon from the Thern Matai Shang (Mark Strong). However, Sab Than proposes peace if he marries the Helium Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). However, John Carter and Dejah Thoris fall in love with each other, and he decides to help the Helium people against the Zodanga people. But Matai Shang sends John Carter back to Earth and his last chance to return to Mars depends on his dear nephew attitude. ""John Carter"" is an excellent sci-fi film and absolutely underrated in IMDb. The complex story is engaging and highly entertaining and among my favorite movies of 2012. The visual concept is fantastic and the story has action, romance and comedy perfectly balanced and a lead couple - Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins – showing a perfect chemistry. The most impressive is that the Edgar Rice Burrough's character John Carter is celebrating one century since his first appearance in 1912. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""John Carter - Entre Dois Mundos"" (""John Carter – Between Two Worlds"")",John Carter
6,nogodnomasters,WHITE MEN CAN JUMP,10,12 May 2019,"The blockbuster ""Avatar"" was loosely based on this book as was ""The Princess of Mars."" Edgar Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara), the author of the book, plays a part in the film in order to give credence to the tale. The tale is patterned on the common early 20th century belief that Mars was inhabited by a dying race with technology greater than our own.The character of John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is nicely introduced through a series of events that take place in Arizona. Carter, a soldier of the lost cause is suddenly transported to Mars and finds himself part of a different war. Because of the low gravity of Mars, John Carter finds that he can run faster and jump higher than the natives. There are two warring factions of humans and giant green creatures just to add to the mix.Lynn Collins plays the warrior princess who wants John Carter to help her defend her city of Helium. Carter, wants only to return to Earth.This movie is finally a fitting tribute to the works of Burroughs. When you watch it, you think, ""Oh, this has been done before,"" or ""that was taken from Star Wars..."" But really this wasn't taken from them, they borrowed from Burroughs. Modern movie goers might find this film a bit cliche and trite. As a sci-fi fan who loves 50's sci-fi stuff, this was 10 stars.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Tween safe.",John Carter
7,kosmasp,More fun that you might think it is,7,31 May 2012,"I actually have no idea why it didn't make any money in America. You can't predict those things. But the studio made up for that with the international Box Office results. Plus when the DVDs and Blu Rays hit the stores, I imagine there will be a win margin for the studio, so all will be good (in time).I won't get into any 3D discussion. You actually don't really need it in any movie. Do I still watch them? Yes, I do. But kudos to directors who stand their ground and say no to it (as does Zack Snyder). But a movie is not better or worse because of the 3D (Clash of the Titans may be an exception to that rule, because it might have been quite watchable, if not for that awful 3D conversion). This movie too, is silly family fun, that has some nice aliens, some bad aliens and a hero you can root for. If you don't take it too seriously then, you might have fun watching it",John Carter
8,classicsoncall,"""This place sure ain't Apache.""",7,24 March 2012,"I wasn't impressed when I saw the trailer for this picture prior to watching ""Act of Valor"" a few weeks ago, in fact I didn't even know there was a film in the works adapting this Edgar Rice Burroughs creation of a century ago. I might have passed on the movie, but was influenced by the glowing reviews of a number of posters here on the IMDb. Just got back from seeing the picture, and this is where you'd probably expect to see me join the chorus of folks dazzled by the brilliance of the picture. Sorry, it just didn't do it for me. Now I'm not going to slam it as a terrible movie, waste of time, wasted two hours of my life business like a lot of haters do when they don't like a picture. There are things I liked and things I didn't, and the negatives tip the scale for me.That's primarily because the film seemed to rely too much on the big battle scenes and over the top action sequences that apparently appeal to a movie going public that's considerably younger than myself. It seems to me that pictures today try to outdo every one that went before in the visuals department, and I don't think that should be the standard for effective story telling. Burroughs himself proved that by the longevity of his books, the first of which in the Barsoom series was called ""A Princess of Mars"", the basis for this story.Additionally, there were aspects of the story that were hard to follow, particularly when the shape shifting character was involved. Interestingly, this aspect of the movie (the hard to follow part) doesn't bother a lot of movie-goers on this board who give the picture high praise, but I REALLY want to know what's going on in a story. Repeat viewings may clear up some of my confusion, but that shouldn't be a requirement to totally enjoy a picture.Giving credit where it's due though, I liked the way the picture brought the Tharks to life, excellent characterizations and CGI work there. The battling sky-ships were also handled exceptionally well, along with all the other special effects. It's just that special effects aren't all that necessary for me. Probably the most interesting aspect of the movie was the way the story book-ended Edgar Rice Burroughs himself as a character in the story.Interestingly, this very morning I watched the 1951 movie ""Quo Vadis"", and in one of many odd occurrences I seem to experience lately, that movie which takes place in the year 68 AD in Imperial Rome, offers a number of scenes involving gladiator combat against wild animals in an arena for the entertainment of the masses. Back then, the opponents were real, lions and wild bulls, and the spectators clamored for blood. ""John Carter"" reinforces the idea that everything old is new again, and replacing ancient Romans with Tharks as Carter (Taylor Kitsch) and Sola battle those big white eyeless apes is an updated appeal to fans who expect something new and different every time out. For younger fans, I can see how this would be exciting stuff, and I don't mean any disrespect when I say it's all been said and done before. At least in the case of Burroughs' novels, they were said and done a hundred years ago.",John Carter
9,jboothmillard,John Carter,3,28 August 2012,"This was marketed like it was going to the new Star Wars, but it failed to deliver at the box office, becoming Walt Disney Studios biggest box office flop, costing up to $250,000,00 to produce and making less than half of the profit back, so I had to see if the reputation matched with the film itself, from director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, WALLE). Basically Basically Edgar 'Ned' Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara) is the nephew of former American Civil War Confederate Army captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), who has died and his body, with his instructions, is put in a tomb that can only be opened from the inside, and Ned has been given Carter's journal, documenting his experiences before his apparent death, Ned hopes it will explain more about what happened to him. In flashback we see the Arizona Territory where John is arrested, but left off by Colonel Powell (Bryan Cranston) as long as he helps in the fight against the Apache, but he escapes with the Colonel and they end up in a cave where John had been digging for gold, and killing a Thern in the cave is unintentionally transported to a desert. Carter eventually finds out he is on the planet Barsoom, known to Earth as the planet Mars, and due to the planet's low gravity and the difference of his bone density he finds the ability to jump high feats and have great strength. There has been a war on the red planet for thousands of years between the cities of Helium and Zodanga, and Carter is caught right in the middle, he is captured by Jeddak (emperor) Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) leader of the Green Martian Tharks. Sab Than (Dominic West), Jeddak of Zodanga, hopes to end the war by marrying Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins), the Princess of Helium, but she escapes with the help of Carter who saves her, and together with Tarkas' daughter Sola (Samantha Morton) start a quest down a sacred river to find a way for the human to go home. They find out the medallion Carter obtained can be activated as a transporter, like before, with the ninth ray, a means of utilising infinite energy, but Thern leader Matai Shang (Mark Strong) and his minions, the Green Men of Warhoon, they attack them, while Sola escapes Carter and Dejah are taken back with them. Dejah is forced into agreeing to marry Sab Than, who gives Carter the medallion and power it holds to go back to Earth, but he stays and is told by Shang, who captures him, how his race the Therns manipulate civilisation on other planets. Carter escapes and with Sola they get the help of the Tharks, but Tarkas has been overthrown by Tal Hajus (Thomas Haden Church), and he forces Tarkas, Carter and Sola into a gladiatorial battle with two vicious ape-like creatures. Carter becomes the leader of the Tharks after killing Hajus, and the Zodangan army are defeated when Sab Than is killed, and after marrying Dejah the princess Carter becomes prince of Helium, and he has decided to stay on Mars forever, throwing away his medallion that could transport him back to Earth. Shang takes this opportunity to transport Carter back to Earth, and without the medallion he cannot get back, and the last few pages of the journal Edgar is reading detail his search to find a medallion on Earth, since the Thern were on Earth thousands of years ago, and after years searching he was killed before he could finish. Ned returns to the tomb where Carter was buried, and Shang disguised as a butler was going to kill him, but Carter rises from the dead to seemingly kill him, he had drunk a coma liquid, but Shang had one so he takes it and whispers the code to return to Barsoom (Mars). Also starring Ciarán Hinds as Tardos Mors, James Purefoy as Kantos Kan, Polly Walker as Sarkoja, Rupert Frazer as Thompson, Nicholas Woodeson as Dalton, David Schwimmer as Young Thark Warrior, Jon Favreau as Thark Bookie and Art Malik as Zodangan General. Kitsch doesn't quite cut it as the leading character with the silly long hair, Collins does better as the feisty and attractive princess, Strong is a bit pantomime villain, West is okay with his time on screen, and the other stars whether on screen or voicing are alright as well. I can't really agree with the critics giving this film three out of five stars, the story wasn't the most original and interesting experience, and overall it was just boring, the only good thing I can say really is that the special effects and computer generated characters and action is good, apart from that a pretty dull science-fiction action. Adequate, in my opinion!",John Carter
10,BA_Harrison,Not as bad as its box-office takings would have you believe.,6,19 October 2013,"It's pretty easy to understand how John Carter flopped at the box office: it's a bloated and often confusing film that demands way too much suspension of disbelief from the viewer, particularly where John Carter's amazing yet inconsistent physical abilities on Mars are concerned.That said, I surprisingly still found myself having a lot of fun, the film delivering excellent effects, stunning scenery, impressive creature designs, and lots of breath-taking pulp sci-fi action set-pieces that prove entertaining despite their blatant silliness.Taylor Kitsch acquits himself well in the title role, making for a dashing, likable hero and giving women a good reason to watch the film; meanwhile, male viewers get to drool over the gorgeous Lynn Collins as Martian princess Dejah Thoris (and yes, all of the alien's names are as silly as this). Kids, on the other hand, will love super fast alien 'hound' Woola, the cute critter designed to detract younger viewers from the fact that they won't have a clue what is going on.",John Carter
11,paul_haakonsen,"Not seventy-two, but only one Virginian for Mars...",6,17 May 2012,"""John Carter"" is one amazing Sci-Fi thrill ride, taking place from the American Civil War period to the red planet Mars.I haven't read the story upon which the movie is based, so I have no vision of how I envision it to be, nor do I have any predetermined hopes or expectations to the movie. So whether or not the movie stays true to the story I have no idea.Now, the story is about John Carter who is a Civil War veteran who stumbles upon a cave of gold and its guardian. Upon a struggle with the guardian, Carter happens to lay hand upon a strange medallion and finds himself in another place. Here he can jump like none ever have, far and high, and he finds himself in the midst of another war, but on a distant planet. John Carter have to come to terms with whom he is before he can take sides in this war and his past and his emotions are weighing heavily on him.There is a lot of action is ""John Carter"", and the action scenes were really nicely executed, making it seem like the action is right up in your face, putting you in the action yourself. And that worked, because the movie takes a hold of you and doesn't let go before the end credits start rolling.The effects and CGIs in the movie were top notch. Lots of really flashy, nice-looking effects and ideas. And the creatures on Mars were really life-like and believable. And I just loved the fact that they didn't make the 'Martians' into little green beings - quite the opposite actually, tall green beings. Anyway, the movements, the appearance, the textures, the details on all these creatures were really great and helped the CGI beings stand out as real-life creatures on the screen.They had a rather impressive ensemble of cast members together for this movie, both the real actors and the voice actors. The lead role of John Carter was played by Taylor Kitsch, who really did a great job. But also noteworthy on the cast list was Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church and Mark Strong.I enjoyed the time and effort they had put into making the various cultures come to life, with various rituals, costumes, decorations, colors, lifestyles, etc. It really helped flesh out the variety in life on Mars.Despite it being a great story and a great action/Sci-Fi movie, then it was a little bit difficult for me to buy into it taking place on Mars. So there was oxygen on Mars? And humans? And they were speaking English? Nah, that part about the movie was somewhat difficult for me to believe in.""John Carter"" is a movie that will thoroughly entertain you for an evening's worth. And it was indeed one massive production for a Disney movie, nice to see they expand out from the usual family movie productions they do. ""John Carter"" delivers lots of action, adventure, CGI effects, and even a love story, so it has almost everything you need in a movie.As for the ending to the movie, well that was somewhat of a nice touch. I liked it, and hadn't anticipated it to turn out like that.",John Carter
12,tavm,John Carter was a mostly wonderful ride to the imagination of Edgar Rice Burroughs,8,12 April 2012,"Okay, after weeks of watching other movies, I finally got to see John Carter today in the first of only two showings for the day. I really enjoyed it despite lots of exposition that almost threatened to make things boring since there was also plenty of exciting action scenes and a wonderful score (by Michael Giacchino) that reminded me of the best of John Williams. It takes a while but once everything is explained, one should just enjoy the ride. Oh, and having a character have the same name as that of the creator of these tales-Edgar Rice Burroughs-was a nice touch. So on that note, I highly recommend John Carter (of Mars). P.S. If you're familiar with my reviews, I'd always like noting when someone came from my birthtown of Chicago, Ill., as was the case of the aforementioned Burroughs.",John Carter
13,BandSAboutMovies,What a mess,2,19 July 2021,"Sure, everyone knows Tarzan, but how many people were clamouring for a movie all about Edgar Rice Burroughs' other hero, the Earthman gone to Mars John Carter? Well, me. But I'm also the same guy who went nuts when Valerian came out.The first book in the adventures of this character - A Princess of Mars - came out in 1917 and was followed by a total of eleven novels. As early as 1931, Looney Tunes director Bob Clampett got Burroughs' approval to make a John Carter movie and worked with teh writer's son John Coleman Burroughs to create rotoscoped animation that was quite realistic. After showing the test footage to film exhibitors in 1936, the movie was cancelled as they believed that the idea of men on Mars was too outlandish for small town audiences. Keep in mind that the very next year saw Flash Gordon play theaters and become a huge success. If Clampett had succeeded, he would have beat Snow White and become the first full-length animated film.Ray Harryhausen wanted to make this film in the 50s and John McTiernan and Tom Cruise tried in the 80s, but technology was never at the right level to make a movie that could capture the look and feel that the novels promised. There was an attempt to make the movie with Robert Rodriguez and John Favreau as well; when the latter fell apart, Favreau moved on to start the MCU with Iron Man. He did voice a Tharg bookie in this film, as he was excited that it was getting made.Andrew Stanton, who directed the Pixar films Finding Nemo and WALL-E was able to convince Disney to get the right back from Paramount and that he could make John Carter into a franchise. Stanton then went on to pretty much shoot the movie twice, consulted animation experts instead of those who made live action movies and ignored marketing advice. There was no way he could have won, however. The movie needed to make $600 million worldwide to just break even, an amazing number that only sixty-three movies have been able to achieve.The movie lost Disney more than $200 million and cost the studio's head Rich Ross his job. He'd already cancelled a 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea remake and cut the budget on The Lone Ranger, yet gave this movie all the money it wanted and a $100 million budget on top of that.How could a movie like this fail? Was it because using Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"" in the trailers made it seem old fashioned? Did the original Star Wars like ads not reach moviegoers? Did fans of Burroughs even know this was in theaters? Or are properties like The Shadow, Green Hornet and The Phantom - and John Carter - no longer well-known?The actual movie is, charitably, a mess. It's a gorgeous looking one, though, with fully realized Tharks and the world of Barsoom. It also strangely has Burroughs himself in the film as a character and starts with the bad guy getting a superweapon instead of introducing us to its hero.We'll never get to see Gods of Mars and Warlord of Mars, sadly. This film bombed on such a nuclear level that probably no studio will ever make another John Carter film. Don't tell the Burroughs estate, who got the rights back and want to make another go of it. Hey - it took 79 years of development to make the first one.",John Carter

15,studioAT,John Carter,3,1 July 2021,"This is certainly an ambitious film.It had an awful lot to do in terms of setting up the world, the characters etc, and probably needed a sequel to really push on and tell stories, rather than set up.Unfortunately it never got one.",John Carter
16,LeonLouisRicci,A Multi-Layred Mess...A Magnifcant Malfunction,4,29 July 2012,"So much has been said about the mega-budget, the animation Director turned live-action Director, the bomb at the box office, the wrong-headed publicity campaign, the ridiculous title and the cloning of other very popular movies. One wonders how long these CGI saturated films can continue to be offered to audiences before they become as interesting to the public as wallpaper or elevator music. Maybe this one is an indication of the inevitable.Movies of this type are like fast-food. They are essentially everywhere and are void of any substance worthy of human consumption except to satisfy a primal urge...temporarily. Not really fulfilling in any sort of rich, stimulating sustenance that enables us to grow in a healthy kind of kindred-ship.Seeing hundreds and thousands of quickly moving pixel participants flailing about engaging in battles of maiming and killing without a wisp of reality or involvement of intent is just paralyzing and it plays like video game vice. So here we have another one that may or may not be entertaining depending on your tolerance. It is visually vibrant, with indulgences of an unrealized complex concept. A multi-layered mess. A movie of magnificent malfunction. A Sci-Fi, Fantasy story borrowed from a wonderful writer with imagination. Written in 1917 when there still were things to imagine that were original and organic.",John Carter
17,CinemaSerf,"The title doesn't really help sell this, but it is good!",7,29 March 2020,"This is a good fun adventure movie that's been subsumed by others of this genre and got lost in the ether, somewhere... Taylor Kitsch starts off as a veteran of the American Civil War who is locked up after refusing to join the US Army. He escapes and seeks safety in a remote desert cave. In the cave he touches a medallion and is transported to another planet (Mars, we later discover) where he can leap tremendous heights and distances and is soon caught up in a colourful, action-packed power struggle between tribes there too. It is a slow-burn at the start; the dialogue can be, I accept, ponderous and the film goes on for way too long; but it is still very well put together. The SFX are superb and the characterisation of the Tharks (horned bipeds who live a tribal existence in caves) presents us with a pre-historic culture in an at times violent, but ultimately quite humane way so we can empathise a little with them in the end. Naturally, there is a romance which does drag it down somewhat as an action film, but I still enjoyed this every bit as much as ""Avatar"" from only 3 years earlier. The ending tees it up for a sequel which I guess will never come... Barsoom!",John Carter
18,zardoz-13,Tarzan on Planet Mars,7,20 March 2012,"Oscar winning ""Finding Nemo"" director Andrew Stanton struggles to make Edgar Rice Burroughs' vintage cowboys and aliens epic ""John Carter"" into a spontaneous, larger-than-life, saga about tyranny and rebellion on the Red Planet. Mind you, Asylum Entertainment beat Disney Studios to the punch with its own abysmal adaptation of the Burroughs' novel ""A Princess of Mars"" that recycled just about every genre cliché. Essentially, Disney and Stanton have delivered what looks like a synthesis of ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and ""Star Wars."" This is one of those sci-fi actioneers with a universe populated by anthropomorphic animals and mythological ""Clash of the Titans"" intermediaries. Burroughs penned his colorful pulp escapism about a century ago in 1912 before stories like it became commonplace. Since Hollywood lacked the computer generated technology to make the world of fantasy appear believable on celluloid, the filmmakers preoccupied themselves with Burroughs' less challenging Tarzan novels. By the time Tinsel town conjured up the technology to produce movies about similar escapades on other worlds, the studios had gone off on their own tangents. In other words, the John Carter novels languished in obscurity, while later epics like ""Star Wars,"" ""Dune,"" and ""Avatar"" emerged and appropriated similar themes. What had been groundbreaking when Burroughs wrote it now looks hackneyed, even though Burroughs forged the formula that others imitated. The cinematic ""John Carter"" gives new meaning to the adage about the first being last. Sadly, too, despite its imaginative special effects, this yarn amounts to another cookie cutter, sci-fi/fantasy melodrama that suffers from a sense of déjà vu.Disillusioned Confederate cavalry officer John Carter (Taylor Kitsch of ""The Covenant"") is prospecting for gold in Arizona when the U.S. Seventh Cavalry tries to recruit him to combat hostile Apaches. Carter refuses not only because this isn't his fight, but also because he has already the Civil War claimed the lives of his wife and daughter. Carter escapes from the guardhouse, purloins a horse, and absconds into wilds. Our hero doesn't get far before he finds himself caught between the Apaches and the trigger-happy cavalry. Gunfire erupts and Carter struggles to escape from the predatory redskins. Scrambling for the sanctuary of a cave that the superstitious savages refuse to enter, he surprises an ethereal alien with a supernatural medallion. Carter blasts this extraterrestrial, confiscates the pendant, and then suddenly finds himself sprawled on distant Mars. Mars resembles the rugged American southwest with its inhospitable terrain and inhabitants. He encounters tall, light-green warriors. These fellows boast an additional pair of arms, heads that resemble the Mutant Ninja Turtles, and large three-toed feet. These four-armed creatures with small tusks protruding from their jaws behave like barbarous African tribesmen and have domesticated animals to serve as their beasts of burden. When Carter isn't tangling with their garrulous giants, he contends with striking humanoid natives covered with tattoos who fly extraordinary mechanical airships which resemble Leonardo da Vinci's designs. The barbarians reside in the outlands, while the humanoids live in metropolitan cities of Helium and Zodanga. Basically, a civil war has been raging for a thousand years between these rivals when John Carter arrives. The treacherous Sab Than (Dominic West), Jeddak of Zodanga wants to slaughter the citizens of Helium. A mysterious society of Therns, led by the villainous Matai Shang (Mark Strong), who serve the goddess Issus, intervenes and arms the Zodangans with a powerful weapon called the Ninth Ray. Helium has nothing to match this devastating blue laser technology. The Therns, however, refuse to let the Zodangans annihilate Helium. They advise Sab Than to marry the Princess of Helium, Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins), to create a stronger society. The defiant Princess flees, and Sab Than pursues her. He destroys her ship, buts she falls into John Carter's arms. On Mars, our eponymous protagonist isn't the same fellow as he was in Virginia. He can leap vast distances and packs a haymaker of a punch that drops his adversaries as if they were straw. Predictably, Carter falls in love with the princess, and she reciprocates. Stanton, ""Samurai Jack"" scenarist Mark Andrews, and ""Spider-Man 2"" scribe Michael Chabon do a fair to middling job with their adaptation. Happily, this franchise inducing nonsense isn't too Disneyesque, but they have taken considerable liberties with Burroughs' book. Anybody who has seen enough sci-fi fantasies will spot the elements that inspired those who came after Burroughs to use them in their movies. Essentially, ""John Carter"" constitutes a ""Stranger in a Strange Land."" Like the quintessential adventurer, our hero embarks on a long journey and blunders into a civil war of sorts between two antagonistic factions. You don't need a Cliff Notes guide to distinguish the heroes from the villains on Mars. Incidentally, Mars isn't really Mars. Instead, the natives refer to it as Barsoom. One of the problems with any movie about an alien world is the environment as well as the natives. Everything might as well be happening on Earth for all of the difference that it makes. Since our hero is a foreigner on Mars, he learns rather painfully that his human powers enable him to do things in their atmosphere that he couldn't accomplish at home. The action often bogs down in complications, and it appears that some of the plot doesn't reach the screen. Further, the leads lack charisma. Taylor Kitsch supplies sufficient brawn, but he acts like a wooden Johnny Depp, while Lynn Collins looks like she has spent more time in the gym than a science laboratory. Dominic West fares best with his arrogant portrayal of an enemy bent on destruction, but you never really hate him with any passion. He is more of a pawn of the Therns. The enigmatic Therns are an irritating bunch of opportunists with a nasty habit of shape-shifting into other characters. Altogether, despite it picturesque settings, ""John Carter"" emerges as a predictable yarn that delivers few revelations.",John Carter
19,grantss,Style over substance,4,31 December 2019,"Great visual spectacle, and that's it. Plot starts well, but runs out of ideas and momentum pretty quickly.

20,Boba_Fett1138,Not getting told in the right required epic and entertaining way.,6,12 March 2012,"This movie seemed like it would be some decent entertainment but I must say I was overall disappointed, with the entire movie.Problem I mostly had with this movie, was that everything was getting presented in a very epic way but the movie itself was still far from one. It's probably because the story never flows well enough and all of the events and characters within this movie seem to be very random.There is never really a sense of excitement or adventure in this movie, even while it obviously was featuring an exciting and adventurous concept. It's just because the story never really seems to get off the ground and none of the characters get handled and developed properly enough. This especially goes for the villains and the movie its sidekicks. They just never seem to have a big enough impact on its story and actually come across as redundant, even though they were not of course.Perhaps it's also true that the story and the movie itself was lacking some true originality. Sure, it's based on a 100-year old story, so perhaps you can't really blame the source material but we have seen similar sort of stories already getting told so many times already, throughout the years. This movie offers far too little new and only remains visually a still interesting enough movie.I wasn't always too fond- or impressed with its special effects but I still liked the movie its look and designs. The character design for all of the aliens was pretty good, as were all of its weaponry and vehicles. It's obvious that a lot of time and effort got put into this movie but it still didn't always paid off all, due to its formulaic story and not adventurous and daring enough approach to its storytelling.Who knows, maybe future John Carter movies will be still way better ones but at this moment in time, I won't be very interested in seeing any more of them.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",John Carter
21,neil-476,Big glossy exciting fun,8,16 March 2012,"US Civil War veteran John Carter is accidentally transported to Mars, where he finds himself in the middle of Mars' own civil war. Fortunately, on Mars he has acquired great strength and the ability to leap vast distances. Even more fortunately, there is a hot princess who fancies him...I have never read any of the Burroughs Barsoom series - during my 50-odd years of enthusiastic sci-fi reading, i have never seen them on the shelves of a book shop or I surely would have tested them. But I know enough about them to know that they are the absolute source of much of the areas of science fiction which I love. And that is why the primary criticism levelled at this film - that it is not original - is unfair. Everything else flowed from these books, but the technology has not existed to put them on screen until now, beaten to the punch by their successors.Looking at the film on its own merits, it is spectacular, it is action packed, the effects are great and, most importantly, it has heart. The characters are drawn strongly and played well. Taylor Kirsch does OK as Carter, but Lynn Collins is great as Dejah Thoris: not only is she terrific to look at, but she convinces totally as a Princess, regal in bearing, aware of her responsibilities, not prepared to be pushed around, and the forerunner of spunky heroines everywhere. Dominic West is a good up-front villain, and Mark Strong adds another quietly malevolent portrayal to his roster. The mo-cap and vocal work on the Thargs (tall 4-armed chappies) is all first rate.The story flows well and is always interesting, complex without being too difficult to follow, and is well told.The big flaw here - maybe the only one of any significance - is the title. ""John Carter"" tells us nothing about the film, and is hardly calculated to get bums on seats. Which is a shame, because I would dearly love to see a sequel.",John Carter
22,anaconda-40658,John Carted Out of Theatres.,3,13 May 2015,"John Carter (2012): Dir: Andrew Stanton / Cast: Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, Samantha Morton, Willem Dafoe, Mark Strong: Although not as big a joke as Battlefield Earth, it certainly camps within the same boundary lines of stupidity. It begins in the old west with John Carter pursued by the Calvary. He enters a cave to claim his gold but is attacked by some appearing stranger whom he kills, although the medallion he was holding transports him to Mars. Now the film has entered Cowboys and Aliens territory. He ends up a prisoner for an army of four armed green people who are fighting against something called Helium. Whatever the case may be, director Andrew Stanton might have scored with animations such as Finding Nemo and Wall*E, but this contraption contains all the suspense of an episode of Care Bears. The screenplay hurls numerous creative visuals our way but the screenplay is a mess. Taylor Kitsch tries to hold a straight face as Carter, and to be fair he seems to have fun with the character's new self discoveries and challenges. Lynn Collins as the Princess of Helium is perhaps the film's biggest joke. She of course, has the ability to fight thus blessing us with her grunts, growls and snarls in a pathetic attempt to make her appear equal to Carter. Apparently Carter must prevent her from getting married, but who cares? Willem Dafoe steals moments as a mutant warrior, and Samantha Morton as his daughter. Mark Strong also makes an appearance as the leader of some clan. They deal out more humanity within a script bent on visuals and complete nonsense. Score: 3 ½ / 10",John Carter
23,FlashCallahan,About as bland as the films title....,2,3 July 2016,"Civil War vet John Carter is transported to Mars, where he discovers a lush, wildly diverse planet whose main inhabitants are 12-foot tall green barbarians. Finding himself a prisoner of these creatures, he escapes, only to encounter the Princess of Helium, who is in desperate need of a saviour........Science Fiction movies are a strange beast. When you have serious ones, they sometimes take a few years to become appreciated and are them regarded as masterpieces, much like BladerunnerThen you have the other side of the spectrum, where science fiction movies are so camp, and so over the top, they are genuinely brilliant films, much like Flash Gordon.Then you have the odd ones that are famous just for sake of their legacy/notoriety, much like The Matrix, and in many respects Battlefield Earth.But JC fails to fall in any of these categories, because it's just so bland, and to have a film that has cost so much, look so awful, and feature one hell of an awful script, you'd be hard pressed to find something else that is so underwhelming, especially since we have such an eclectic cast.So it's basically a film about a miserable runaway who can jump really high, and gets himself into all types of mischief.It's the intergalactic The Last Samurai, everybody is against him a the beginning, and come the end, everyone loves him.Kitsch has proved that he is this decades Josh Lucas, every summer blockbuster he's in is a failure, see Battleship for proof.Deserved of its criticism, JC is probably one of the most slow moving, joyless blockbusters I've ever seen.At least The Phantom Menace had a Pod Race.",John Carter
24,phd_travel,You get a lot of movie in one - a good solid adventure,8,9 March 2012,"This is a grand epic adventure story with historical, cowboy, science fiction and gladiator elements all rolled into one. Production is extravagant with epic battles and sweeping desert scenes for Mars. It's adventure without gore since Disney did it - the family can watch it. The CGI is there but it's not too overdone. The good points are: the story. There is a proper story which is something recent movies are lacking. Whether some of it makes total sense or not doesn't matter. It's old fashioned in a good way - an adventure story and a proper ending - in a Star Wars, HG Wells - Time Machine way. Although the martians looked a bit Avatar they are less irritating. There are some moments of humor though there could have been more. The jumping around is quite fun. The actors are well chosen. I like Lynn Collins for this role. While not the most beautiful actress out there, she is convincing and the right blend of statuesque princess and action heroine. She has a slightly ethnically ambiguous look which suits the science fiction genre. Taylor Kitsch is good. He isn't too overbuilt so he remains realistic for the story which isn't a superhero story. They made him a bit too scruffy and tired looking in parts. Minus Points: The battle between the various Martian factions is a bit heavy and tedious. Don't really care about who is fighting who. It could have lost about 20 minutes - some scenes are repetitive but at least you get your money's worth.Overall catch it on the big screen - it's worth a watch.",John Carter
25,Wuchakk,Overstuffed story is entertaining Sci-Fi/adventure with good cast and spectacular visuals,7,22 May 2016,"Released in 2012, ""John Carter"" chronicles the adventures of the eponymous 19th century character (Taylor Kitsch) after he's mysteriously projected to Mars, where he encounters a tribe of 12' tall green creatures with four arms called Tharks and a beautiful princess, Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). He's subsequently caught in a war between left and right factions of the planet. Dominic West plays Sab Than, the leader of the red faction who wants to marry the princess while Mark Strong plays the head Thern, a mysterious race of immortal shapeshifters who manipulate the races of planets to feed off the chaos. This is a dense and entertaining adventure/fantasy based on Edgar Rice Borroughs' book ""A Princess of Mars,"" sometimes spectacularly so as far as the visuals, sets, props, costuming, cast, locations, etc. go. Kitsch and Collins, for example, are stunning examples of masculinity and beauty respectively. What's more, there's some quality mindfood to mine, like Matai Shang's comment to Carter that every world they're involved with has the same conflict of extremes (red vs. blue, right vs. left) and the Therns ""manage"" it. They tend to stay in the shadows cultivating controlled chaos through manipulating the indigenous populace. They somehow feed off of this and have done so for eons – prolonging the eventual destruction as long as possible, like rationing food.For those who nitpick the film for supposed plot holes, these can mostly be explained. For instance, the complaint that the 9th ray can't stop a bullet. But why would we presume that an energy field could stop a physical projectile? Obviously the 9th ray force-field only blocks the same type of energy it's comprised of; that is, 9th ray energy. There's no inconsistency in the film. At no time do we observe the 9th ray portrayed as an omnipotent weapon. It's powerful and versatile, obviously, based on how it's employed in technology, but it's not all-powerful. If the Therns or anyone else using the 9th ray could use it to stop a sword or bullet, they would. But allowing it to be that all-powerful would make it TOO powerful. The movie wisely doesn't do this for the same reason Superman has kryptonite.Then there's the complaint that Carter appears super strong when it comes to fighting Tharks and twirling a huge boulder, but he can't break a simple chain. Believe it or not, this actually isn't a problem and is scientifically viable. Carter's not any stronger on Mars than he is on Earth. If he can't break a thick iron chain on Earth, he can't do it on Mars either. However, because Mars has lower gravity he seems super-strong when it comes to ANY ACTION INVOLVING WEIGHT. Although this is ridiculously exaggerated in the movie (like his absurd leaps), it fits the pulp fantasy tone. So it's actually logical that he can lift heavy things but not break an iron chain. One has nothing to do with the other. Lower gravity would simply have no influence on whether or not Carter can break an iron chain.One last supposed plot hole is how the Therns are immortal, but then one or two get shot to death. This is easy: Being immortal in this case doesn't mean they can't be wounded or die; it just means they can't die of aging. While the Therns claim to be immortal Carter proves they can be mortally wounded at the beginning of the film, which is why he later points out: ""Immortal ain't bulletproof. I shot one of you back on Earth."" If the Therns present themselves as eternal in the sense of being impossible to kill, it's obviously to create and perpetuate a superstitious belief in their subjects.Then there's the criticism that the movie screeches to a halt when the head Thern, Matai Shang (Strong), has a walking conversation with Carter. Wow, I can't believe this complaint because I found this sequence the most intriguing one in the film and it morphed the movie from mindless fantasy-adventure-on-another-planet to something deeper. The sequence simultaneously reveals the mystery of the Therns while being ambiguous enough to keep the viewer scratching his/her head and searching for more concrete answers (which, I'm sure, would've been answered in sequels). At this point in the movie it becomes clear that Mars is a stage and the Therns work behind the scenes to (try to) manipulate the players for their own ends. But they're not omnipotent or immortal in the sense that they cannot be killed. They can be resisted and thwarted, even defeated. Their existence is dependent upon their deceiving people into believing lies, myths and half-truths; or just keeping them ignorant. When you relate this to our lives on earth it becomes even more profound. We're being manipulated by ""Therns,"" whether political, commercial, religious or spiritual, but most people don't even realize it. Worse, many deny it despite the evidence. The movie runs 132 minutes and was shot in Arizona, Utah and New Mexico with studio work done in England.GRADE: B+",John Carter
26,trashgang,great effects but a typical Disney script,7,29 July 2012,"So much is said about this flick. Some say it's amazing others hate it. Some critics say it was a box office flop, others say it was a big success. Of course all that bragging only gave free promotion to this flick. Also here it was the talk of the town, you had to see it to believe it. Well, I agree on some points. On part of the effects it is indeed amazing and on part of the story it did work too if you are a bit open-minded. It also starts with cowboys and Indians which suddenly turns into cowboys and ...you guessed it, aliens. Once John Carter (Taylor Kitsch)is meeting one from outer space this flick turns into a pure science-fiction. It's all beautifully done and directed but of course I have a but. The one thing that bothered me while seeing promo's and trailers was the distributor, Disney.For me Disney is most of the time a bit dull. No nudity, no gore and heroes do what they do best, survive and falling in love. And let that just be the part that shows again in a Disney release. It's all great until we have the first fight with swords. By this time we are used to see a bloody mess '300' (2006) or even some gory parts 'Immortals' (2011). No blood to see in John Carter even as they have a slaughtering in an arena. Naturally being a difficult kind of guy John becomes weak when he sees Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) and agrees to save the planet. If you want brutality or bloody gore shots like it is done nowadays in science-fiction flicks then keep your hands off it but if you like heroes like Indiana Jones or the first Star Wars then this is surely one for you. You can see the influence of Disney even as rumors say that Disney took a distance from it due the trailers/posters and unknown cast, even as for buffs Collins had a role in True Blood (2008) and in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) as did Taylor. Be honest, it's just a love story on mars with a hero falling in love for a princess. And what about the last 10 minutes. Still, a must see for the special effects.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",John Carter

However, the movie has and exciting story, but the alternative world with different creatures etc is too science fiction for me. The story is easy to follow and enjoyable, but it is for the Star Wars crowd. The story has John Carter as a stranger in a strange land. There is a war, and a bride which needs to be married. The movie has great special effects, well directed and acted. I did not mind the movie but it is no Star Wars either. I give John Carter six out of ten.

28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: John Carter,4,28 February 2012,"John Carter is about 100 years old. The creation of writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, he predates even Tarzan, another Burroughs' creation, and is set in the planet of Mars, or Barsoom in Burroughs-speak in what would feature an early planetary romance, complete with fantasy, swords and sorcery. At least that's what's on the plate in the series of books that helped inspire countless of other writers and other sci-fi fantasy stories both in print, and film. So in essence there isn't much that would surprise you in the original source material that featured Burrough's fictional self as well (played by Daryl Sabara), and Andrew Stanton's adaptation is fairly lacklustre from plot to action sequence, that a wave of familiarity will sweep your consciousness as you try to tune into the strange civilizations thrust upon you.Predominantly based on the book ""A Princess of Mars"", the narrative adapted by Andrew Stanton, Mark Andrews and even Michael Chabon failed to ignite that sense of swashbuckling adventure involving a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War, our titular hero John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), who found himself inexplicably transported to Mars when out and about his second career of gold prospecting in Virginia. Throw in what you will from Dances with Wolves to Avatar involving being that proverbial fish out of water, and you get what the first hour is all about. Picked up by green skinned Martians with six limbs known as the Tharks, John is enslaved to fight for the Tharks given his super-human abilities scientifically blessed upon him due to Mar's lesser gravity, and soon rises to become one of their folk heroes, christened Dotar Sojat.But that's not before getting himself tripped up in the civil war between the red skinned humanoid Martians from Helium and Zodanga, and falling in love with the scantily clad princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) who's forced into marriage by her father to their enemies in order to see a truce. With their flying machines and intra-planetary chase, you'd wonder where George Lucas would have gotten his inspiration for the opening of A New Hope, or vice versa in how these characters got introduced. And when one gets embroiled in someone else's war, what more developing the hots for a princess who holds the key to one's return home, you know for a fact that trouble will come knocking in less time the planet orbits around the sun.Andrew Stanton, whose previous films were the Pixar animated features Finding Nemo and Wall.E, may be inspired by fellow colleague Brad Bird's successful live action venture with Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, and embarked on his own franchise-potential with this live action effort. However, it's a whole new different ball game that Stanton got himself into, and will find that pacing is so key to a film, given the huge sag in the middle, unable to keep consistent pace to what had already been set up. John Carter gets everywhere and couldn't decide many times whether to play it straight, or comical. It couldn't decide whether to focus on the drama, or become that special effects extravaganza, resulting in an effects film that didn't have anything to wow, and at best was derivative. Worse of all, John Carter didn't have direction. Objectives were scattered - one minute he's dead set on wanting to go home, while the next got persuaded in less than convincing terms to stay and interfere with the inhabitants livelihood. Here the story goes all The Adjustment Bureau in having what could be their predecessor Watchmen type headed by Matai Shang played by Mark Strong (surely his contract must have stated he must be in all blockbuster franchise potential as the key villain; he's so overused that he's getting stereotypically boring already) being that almighty Deux Ex Machina ensuring Fate gets played out like it should. And to try and force in a little romantic interlude with a backstory from Earth, didn't make the story any more emotionally appealing.The action sequences also couldn't have been any more less interesting. Sure, John Carter exhibits space age Tarzan capabilities without the need of a vine, and has the charisma to charm all native inhabitants to be king of the Mars jungle, but alas there's nothing that will put you at the edge of your seat. Perhaps it's that century old tale that got ripped by many others already, that the filmmakers fell into the been-there-done-that pit trap and failed to ignite the big screen with originality. From space battles to Prince of Persia type battles, this film could have benefited from more creativity, especially with an ensemble cast assembled with the likes of Willem Dafoe, Samantha Morton, Thomas Haden Church, Ciaran Hinds, Domic West, Bryan Cranston, and the list goes on.What saved the movie instead was Edgar Rice Burroughs the writer and creator himself, given the literary device that he had used to tell the story. This device of having the novelized Burroughs possessing the manuscript passed onto him by John Carter, was the only saving grace of the film, giving it a thrilling finale that thankfully the filmmakers decided to keep, without which it will lack a crescendo and fall flat on its face. It's certainly primed for a franchise given the wealth of stories from the source material, but unless it promises a much better effort put in for subsequent films, John Carter will join the ranks of many literary fantasy translations for the big screens and fail to lift off.",John Carter
29,siderite,A well done sci-fi classic,8,20 June 2012,"Taking into account that this is based on A Princess of Mars, a pulp fiction book from 1917, the film was awesome. The special effects are great and used all throughout the film (not just for the scenes in the trailer), the acting is good and the story is not some half-assed attempt to make it science proof or to sync it up with the 21th century.Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote the book when people still believed Mars could be just another life supporting planet, only red. Instead of attempting to make it more plausible, the writers decided on revamping only the style of the action and keeping the story intact. For that alone and the fact they didn't fill the movie with useless ""improvements"" I give John Carter a top mark.Of course, not everything is so great. One cannot watch the movie and not think of Avatar. Basically, it is the same story, only with green and red people instead of blue. The same impatient father ready to marry his daughter with whoever comes and asks for her. There are also some evil alien dudes around that pull the strings, reminiscent of old Arabian stories with evil sorcerer viziers and lovely princesses. The thing is that, even if there is a lot of pulp in the film, most of it came from the original material.Take in mind that the Barsoom series spanned 11 books, with three of them (yet another trilogy?) directly related to John Carter. The material is rich, can they continue to keep the quality high? I hope so.",John Carter

31,KineticSeoul,imaginative and well crafted sci-fi movie,8,4 June 2012,"I personally think some critics are being way too harsh with this movie and some even claiming that it's a really crappy movie. It's not one of the best sci-fi movie I have ever seen but it's still pretty darn good. Sure it does have it's slow parts but those parts are necessarily for the build up. Maybe it's because a lot of the viewers had very very high expectations or something. Personally I didn't because of the constant negative reviews, maybe that was it. But I found myself actually really enjoying this movie, sure it gets slightly boring at times but the movie also picks up pretty quickly. I never read any of the books this movie is based on but it seems like a pretty good adaptation. Even if it may not be completely faithful to the books it's based on it goes in a entertaining and yet fast paced direction. The story however might seem a bit convoluted and might be difficult to understand for younger viewers. The way it gives little bit of hints to what is going on and finishes the puzzle by the end of this movie was done ins a very well crafted manner. Sure there are few obvious plot holes but it doesn't make it all that distracting either when the overall plot comes together. The plot involves these 2 human looking groups at war with each other and they are sort of like the futuristic roman armies and there is a group of green alien beings that look like a mix between ninja turtles and Goro from Mortal Kombat. So in another words it's sort of like the civil war except it takes place on mars with magical and sort of futurist elements. But the main 2 characters are of course John Carter(Taylor Kitsch) and the Princess of Mars Dejah Thoris(Lynn Collins) who is hot and very attractive in this especially with her charismatic voice and British accent. Even when the plot seemed to be tad bit boring her presence in this is close enough to make those scenes very watchable. Maybe it's because of her skimpy attires she wears all the time. For the girls there is Tylor Kitsch. The design and environment is just dazzling and very creative. The artists that worked on the design of the world and environment, including the costume design did a amazing job. Just about every aspect of this movie when it comes to Mars in this was just vivid and fascinating to watch. This movie overall is far from being a bad movie, but what it lacked was the snappy and wittiness of it all, even if the story itself is fast paced. It's a movie that takes sometime to get used to and enjoy. The cinematography, CGI and special effects are topnotch in this which isn't a shock considering the large amount of money that went into this movie. Despite few flaws I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and glad I decided to watch this flick. In fact I wouldn't mind seeing it again. It's unfortunate that this movie didn't make the hit that the creators were expecting. But I am still really hoping for a sequel, especially since I don't like to see things that are unfinished. And I really want to watch what happens next in this creative and imaginative world that takes place on mars.8/10",John Carter
32,sddavis63,Maybe Sci Fi And Disney Don't Mix Very Well,2,5 November 2012,"This movie isn't a complete waste of time, since it does at least teach you something: namely, that Disney is capable of doing many things well, but putting out decent science fiction is certainly not one of them. ""John Carter"" isn't a complete disaster. It's got beautiful sets, beautiful costumes and some superb special effects. Surprisingly, in my opinion, its animation isn't quite top-notch. It's not bad; it's better than most, but it isn't quite to the standard I would have expected from Disney. So, yes, this does do some things right, but what it does right can't even come close to compensating for its major weakness.Basically, the story here is incomprehensible. It lost me in the opening minutes and it never really got me back. The story (which is based on an Edgar Rice Burroughs story from 1917) revolves around the title character, a Confederate officer in the Civil War who finds himself mysteriously transported to Mars and placed into the middle of an interplanetary civil war as various races and factions vie for power on the Red Planet.The whole thing comes across to me as a muddle. It manages to throw in some subtle humour every now and then, which is something of a relief from the tedium it inspires within the viewer, but it's overall a terrible example of science fiction.

33,Hellmant,"People are idiots, despite it's weak showing 'JOHN CARTER' should go down in cinematic history as classic Sci-Fi cinema!",10,1 May 2012,"'JOHN CARTER': Five Stars (Out of Five) $250 million big screen adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's classic science fiction adventure 'A Princess of Mars', the first novel in an 11-volume series about the adventures of John Carter on Mars. The film comes a hundred years after the character first appeared in pulp magazines. The story revolves around a Civil War vet who finds himself on Mars as the prisoner of 12-foot barbarian creatures and later a princess's unwitting hero. Despite being high quality epic Sci-Fi entertainment the movie disappointed at the domestic box-office (due to misfire marketing) but has done well overseas and should eventually make a small profit. Still it's performance doesn't look good for planned sequels. Despite it's weak showing it should go down in cinematic history as classic Sci-Fi cinema! Taylor Kitsch stars as the title character, a Civil War vet who is locked up in 1868 for refusing to join the Army. He escapes and flees to a cave where he finds a mysterious medallion which transfers him to Mars (unknowingly). There he has special powers which allow him to defy gravity and leap huge distances and heights. He is discovered by 12-foot creatures, which take him prisoner, and later meets a human princess (the gorgeous Lynn Collins, who also co-starred with Kitsch in 'X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE') who makes him aware to the fact that he's on Mars and also asks for his help in defending her people in an ongoing war there.The film was directed and co-written (along with Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon) by Andrew Stanton in his first live-action feature effort (Stanton previously directed the popular Pixar films 'WALL-E' and 'FINDING NEMO'). Stanton has been severely publicly blamed for the movie's domestic failings. I think he did an admirable job bringing the classic character to life and how he chose to market the film worked for me. People are idiots (a large amount at-least), the fact that they'd rather pay to see something like 'THE VOW' in theaters than 'JOHN CARTER' isn't Stanton's fault. The movie is a great action spectacle that should please any true fans of the genre and cinema (and everyone I know that's seen the movie has loved it). It will still go down in history as a great action adventure film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rHRJKrR2Lk",John Carter
34,thesar-2,Total Recall and Should've Been,2,8 December 2012,"During the screening of John Carter, the guy to my right kept laughing when the movie was supposed to be intentionally funny. I only laughed when the movie was unintentionally funny. Needless to say, I laughed a lot more.That's not to say I had a good time. I certainly didn't. I was more concerned with which plot we were on to even attempt to keep up with the so-called ""fun."" This isn't even a ""leave-your-brain-at-the-door"" feature because you'll sure to need one to even attempt to keep up with the 150 ideas presented from beginning to end.You see, if a friend were to ask me what this film was about, it would be incredibly hard to pinpoint it. This would probably be my response, following the recommendation of seeing any other film: ""Well, it's about a marriage, a warring traveling city, babies who are both hatched and killed, shift-changers, two deserts – one here and one out there, the old frontier, the new frontier, the old west with a bit of the old New York, an inheritance, an arena fight, a parentless race, a waterless place, a lost and found soul, one giant and continuous leap for one kind of man, immortals, redemption, love, hate, deceit, and so on and so onI guess to sum it up: take all six episodes of Star Wars, throw in both The Wizard of OZ and Gladiator with a splash of The Matrix and mix with Avatar, narrow them ALL down to one film and show each sub-film/genre simultaneously, and you'll have John Carter.""As you can tell, the movie's all over the place, and if that weren't bad enough, 90% of the dialogue is the odd names chosen over a hundred years ago for Mars-Lingo. So, try and follow who's who, when every other name sounds un-coincidentally like ""Jed-I"" and the alien voices sound even less surprisingly like Jabba the Hut. Try your best to decipher who hates who, why they do and which race we're supposed to root for. And see if you can tell the difference between the desert planet of Mars and Arizona. (In AZ's defense, and I'm not normally on this 100-year-old state's side, I would live here over Mars – there is NO WAY I would ever visit the barron lands of Mars, if given the chance. In the great words of C-3PO – who all-but showed up here: ""What a desolate place this is."")In addition to the over-confusion of plot and themes, there's not much more going for it: the score sucked back, the acting: eh, the costumes were god-awful and unimaginative, the cinematography was terrible, the clichés rampant, the dialogue boring and old, the themes stale and below all else, the $250 million spent to make this will turn Disney over in his grave. Instead of the obvious comparisons to ""WaterWorld"" it should've been called ""DesertWorld.""I've been told this was from a 100-year-old idea/book (well, duh) and others, namely George Lucas, borrowed from this for their stories previously referenced in this review. Fine, but that doesn't mean going back to the original material and making it into a feature length film is a good idea. Or fresh. Because it was neither. It was an over-long two-hour bloated and boring experience that I hope not to wish upon anyone. Heck, even when there's supposed to be a moral, the plot switches gears again and you can't even grasp onto the ""good feeling"" you knew was there in one of the original re-writes.This movie was pathetic and even the sometimes good special effects does not equate a recommendation. In fact, I cannot come up with ONE valid reason to see this. Even if you were a fan of Sci-Fi-Action-Out-of-World films, the ""fight/battle"" scenes were random and never pinpointed on who we were supposed to root for, if any. Stay away from Mars, and visit Arizona instead.Make that: Visit AZ between December and February, you know, when the weather's decent.",John Carter
35,cherold,"starts slow, but it does pick up",6,12 June 2012,"I was curious to see how the writer/director of WALL-E and Finding Nemo would fare with a live action picture, and the answer is, sorta okay.Initially the movie is pretty underwhelming. There's an introductory action scene reminiscent of cheesy 50s/60s action-adventure movies. Then there's a bland framing sequence followed by way too much of John Carter on earth. I was so bored after probably less than a half hour that I considered giving up on the movie altogether, but then I thought I might as well fast forward to the mars part.The first bright spot in the movie is, perhaps predictably, heavily animated, as we are introduced to four-armed martians. They turn out to be far more interesting than the humanoids. Then there are more humanoids and I got bored and fast forwarded some more until I got back to the four-armers, and then I watched the rest.At this point the movie gets pretty interesting. There are some nifty action scenes and the story picks up. There is even one really nice battle scene intercut with flashback's of a tragedy on earth that is genuinely moving. At its best, John Carter is mindless, Saturday afternoon action, although far inferior to great examples of that like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars. But the director should probably stick with robots and fish, because he makes those much more human than John Carter's humans",John Carter
36,bowmanblue,Don't believe (all) the negativity,7,17 October 2014,"John Carter bombed when it was in the cinema. It lay in production hell for decades (since the 1930s if you can actually believe that) then, when it was released, it suffered from weird rebranding based on the fact that the title should have been 'John Carter of Mars' but studio executives don't think films with the word 'Mars' in the title do well at the Box Office.Anyway, I watched it with low expectations and was actually pleasantly surprised. It's about a soldier in 1800s America, being transported to Mars (you don't need to know how, he just does, okay?) and helping a Princess and her people fight an evil lot of assorted baddies.And that's that. Granted the film doesn't require an awful lot of brainpower to understand, but then it is only rated 12, meaning it's mainly aimed at kids. Perhaps critics should remember that? I actually find the 12 rating a little strange. It basically means children (or rather boys, as I'm sure they're the audience who would enjoy it most - oh, an me of course) under the age of twelve aren't supposed to watch the film. Yes, there's a certain amount of 'fantasy violence,' but effectively only 'Tom and Jerry-style' violence, only done with real people and computer generated characters. I'd have thought boys as young as about six could happily watch, understand and not get disturbed by this film.For adults, you might not like this film. It's a bit silly, cliché and offers nothing much that you haven't seen before. However, if you watch it with a view to it being a useful tool to keep 'Little Johnny' quiet for a couple of hours on a Saturday morning, you may find it's what he's been waiting for - cool action scenes, plenty of spaceships and monsters, plus a Princess who wears such little clothing that it makes Kate Middleton look quite covered up when she's on holiday in France on a private balcony.",John Carter
37,MLDinTN,better adventure than I was expecting,7,20 November 2012,"I thought this movie was pretty good. The main part I didn't like was Mars. Why Mars because it didn't look anything like Mars. Mars is shown as being a hot desert; he should have just been sent to another galaxy and a new planet. But if you can get past that, I did think the story was good.John is a soldier and finds himself in a cave surprised by a Thern, which is from another planet. He kills the guy, but is transported to another planet. There he can jump really high and has great strength. He gets involved with a war between 3 groups, one of which are aliens. I liked the aliens in this; they looked cool. He joins up a princess to save her people. So the rest of the movie is about the war between them all and how John plays into it.And I really liked the end when John goes back to Earth and how that played out. Plus it's set up for the perfect sequel.FINAL VERDICT: A fun adventure, I recommend it.",John Carter
38,g-bodyl,Visually Stunning and Very Entertaining!,9,14 November 2013,"John Carter is a much better film than what you have been led to believe. We all know about the box office troubles of this movie and people should not believe the marketing of the movie. I admit the marketing was terrible, but the actual product is practically a thing of beauty that ranks among sci-fi classics such as Star Wars and Avatar. This is an example of what a fun, action-adventure film should be. The story is easy to follow and is well-written and the film is visually stunning hence the $250 million dollar price tag.Andrew Stanton's film is about a cavalry man named John Carter who is summoned to Mars from Earth where he meets a warring tribe, the Thorks. He also gets mixed up with a warrior princess named Dejah and they gang up to stop Mars from being taken over by these space wizards.This film has an impressive cast. Taylor Kitsch is really good as John Carter and he has the looks and stamina for Carter. Lynn Collins is very good as Dejah. Of course, we see some other high profile actors here like Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church, Mark Strong, and even Bryan Cranston.Overall, this is a fantastic and entertaining film that reminds me of Star Wars mainly Attack of the Clones and Gladiator as well as the other films I previously mentioned. This film has plenty of action and adventure, but it does provide some in-depth characterization. I also like the creature designs and the score too. I'm sorry this failed because I would have liked to see more. Don't listen to what other people have to say, because this is nothing but a fun, visually-filled, and entertaining film. I rate this film 9/10.",John Carter
39,cricketbat,This film deserved to flop.,2,23 November 2018,"John Carter is a cluttered mess. This movie throws so many characters, visual effects and plotlines at you that it becomes incomprehensible. Perhaps I would have enjoyed this movie more if I had read the novel, because then I would have a better understanding of the backstory that it glosses over. However, on the other hand, if I had read the book, I might have been angry about what the filmmakers did to the story. This film deserved to flop.",John Carter

However, its cornball acting is indefensible.Besides, interplanetary travel in the 1800s was only obtainable through opium inhalation. (Red Light)",John Carter
41,The-Sarkologist,"Great Movie, but something was missing",7,17 March 2012,"It looks like this movie flopped, which is a shame because it wasn't really a bad movie. It wasn't a great movie either, but it really did not deserve to flop the way it did (it cost $250mill to make and made only $30mill on the opening weekend). The funny thing was that throughout the movie I just felt that there was something missing and that it seemed somewhat familiar. It was not until I got to the end of the movie that I almost screamed out 'Flash Gordon'. Okay, it is not Flash Gordon, and Flash Gordon probably borrowed ideas from the original novel, but it did not seem to be all that original.This film is based on the book by Edgar Rice Burroughs called 'Princess of Mars'. Now some have suggested that pretty much all science-fiction since has been based upon these series of books, but I would suggest otherwise. Burroughs was not the first to write Science-fiction, and while I consider Jules Verne to be the father of science-fiction, it is really Mary Shelley (in collaboration with her husband Percy Shelley) that really set the foundations of modern science-fiction. Even them, numerous authors before them (Lucian of Samotosa for instance) have written stories about journeys to the moon.It beginning of the movie confused me a bit, and I got a little bored waiting for John Carter to get to Mars. However it turns out that the events at the beginning (despite me dozing off and having to try and work out what is going on) is important to the end. However it was quite unnecessary. As it turns out, the bookends of the movie seem to have been rushed and forced through, as a lot of other parts of the movie. I found the method of Carter getting to Mars a little odd (though it is explained a bit later, but not fully) and was confused as to why Burroughs appears. I actually found the appearance of Burroughs to be somewhat contrived, as if his stories are based on the autobiography of John Carter. It also seemed that after all is said and done, and we can sit back and say that he has succeeded (and got the girl) the movie suddenly throws us into a further plot. As I said previously, it was simply not necessary.However, please don't let these gripes put you off what is a really good movie. This movie is for anybody that loves science-fiction and loves alien civilisation. It was the civilisation that I simply loved. The setting is late 19th century with John Carter a former Civil War officer who has walked away from the corps having been disgusted with its attitudes. At one point he is staring down a group of apaches and the cavalry, not wanting to provoke either side, but the trigger happy cavalry do the job for him. However when we get to Mars we see a wasted landscape full of ruined cities inhabited by aliens, some human, others not. We have flying ships, but designed to look closer to a science-fantasy setting of the late 19th century. I had heard of these books, and these flying ships, but had never seen anything close to this outside of Doctor Who and Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. This is a good movie, and those who like science-fiction, should really give it a go.",John Carter
42,poe426,Computer-generated-motion picture...,1,17 December 2012,"Edgar Rice Burroughs is said to have taken a look around at all the bad science fiction and fantasy being written at the time and decided that he could write something just as bad. He was right. The John Carter books are among some of the worst-written stories I've ever tried to read; this computer-generated-motion picture is a faithful translation of the comic books based on those books. Cha-cha-cha. Now, I have nothing against Space Opera, per se: Alex Raymond's FLASH GORDON happens to be one of my all-time favorite comic strips; and the very first STAR WARS movie (the ORIGINAL version, the one where Han Solo AIN'T faster than a speeding bullet), while ostensibly just a reworking of the BUCK ROGERS and FLASH GORDON serials, was fun (before it became a bloated Monstrosity worthy of Ming the Merciless)- but we've seen enough Sigh Phi over the years to be more than a little jaded when something like this comes lumbering at us.

44,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Will satisfy sci-fi fans with great scope and vision, but others won't likely care",7,21 April 2012,"When we think of science fiction, we so often think about the future. We expect it to stretch our imaginations in ways we never thought possible with groundbreaking concepts beyond our current understanding. ""John Carter"" appears to aspire to that level. Yet in spite of the film's hefty price tag, use of latest in motion-capture technology, 3D conversion and all the other tell-tale signs of an ambitious blockbuster, ""John Carter"" is classic, old-school sci fi/fantasy at heart.And that's the way it should be. After all, the source material comes from Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""A Princess of Mars,"" a pulp story nearly 100 years old. Rather than give us a ""John Carter"" for the 21st Century, director Andrew Stanton gives us ""John Carter"" as made possible by the technological advancements of the 21st Century.It starts with a vision, and that's what Stanton (and all Pixar disciples) brings to the table. One can imagine the concept art he used to sell this movie to Disney didn't change much from inception to the film canister. Anyone with unadulterated love for science fiction will be captivated by the ""John Carter's"" production design. Especially in terms of costume and the big set pieces, the film has that Roman-inspired sci-fi look reminiscent of ""Flash Gordon"" and in some cases ""Star Wars.""As with most classical science fiction, the story deals almost exclusively in archetypes. Captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is a Civil War veteran who at the story's beginning is dead. He has willed and entrusted his journal to his nephew, a fictionalized version of Burroughs (Sabara), the contents of which explain all that's happened to him over the years, including how he ended up on Mars. Transported there mysteriously while prospecting for gold in Arizona, Carter becomes a near-prophetic hero to the planet's race of green creatures called Tharks, but also saves a ""red"" woman named Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins), who is a princess that begs of his help to end a brutal war.The story and script maintains its composure throughout, something at which science-fiction films often fail. It starts like pulp and ends like pulp rather than aspiring to be above the material. Consequently, ""John Carter"" does little to appeal to anyone but a true sci-fi nerd; it asks us to embrace this fantastical world on Mars (or I should say Barsoom), just as Carter the character works his way through his interplanetary transplant rather than freaking out about it. Stanton and co-writers Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon (the novelist) spare us all the inane dialogue about how weird everything is on this planet. Carter just accepts it, and fans of this film will be the ones who follow his example.The scope and scale of the film feels quite close to ""Avatar,"" as both were about visual wonder and stuck to basic storytelling. ""John Carter"" only loses points in terms of the quantity and intensity of the action sequences and the depth of character. Kitsch and Collins make for likable leads and you believe the emotions they feel, but they're undeniably cookie-cutter.Some of the side characters, including Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and Sola (Samantha Morton) show potential for some emotional pull, but it's all short-lived as the story is constantly on the move to the next locale or sequence. The personal moments between characters are reserved for exposition and expanding the lore of Barsoom. Again, great for geeks, but I can't imagine it will please much of anyone else.Simply, ""John Carter"" is for nostalgists. Instead of being your modern science-based science fiction, this is the kind steeped in fantasy. It will make many recall the first time they experienced ""Star Wars"" or any similar film or television show that crafted its own world or universe. Stanton provides no shortage of things to marvel at, a variety of people, places and vehicles bound to capture the imaginations of younger moviegoers and gratify those who used to be those younger moviegoers.There was a time when ""John Carter"" would have been a major hit and blown the minds of everyone who saw it. Science fiction has just evolved to the point that this kind of a story captures a specific time in our storytelling history rather than opening our eyes to the possibility of the future. That's the difference between ""John Carter"" and ""Avatar,"" for one thing. So as much as Stanton and Disney have used the advances in special effects to tell this story in a way that it never could before and does so quite well, ""John Carter"" offers a very specific type of entertainment best for a niche audience.~Steven CThanks for reading!

45,Vartiainen,"Reaches for the stars, but doesn't get there",6,14 November 2019,"John Carter, based on a novel called A Princess of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs, is the story of a 19th century Confederate soldier, who gets transported by a mysterious medallion to Mars, or Barsoom as the locals call it. Given great powers by the planet's lower gravity, he gets caught up in the infighting between different Martian factions. He rescues princesses, battles in arenas, searches for mysterious caves, gets caught up in court intrigue, reveals hidden alien super beings. All that good stuff.The original novel is now over a century old. Yet it's still an enjoyable read. It suffers from the Mighty Whitey trope, but then again it was written in the first years of the 20th century. It might even be somewhat subdued for its time, I can't really say one way or another. But what it has in spades is imagination. The Tarzan books, also by Burrougs, have nothing on this book, and even they get pretty outlandish the further you read them.And this film showcases that pretty well. It is quite unlike anything else to have come out in recent years, full of new concepts, new characters ideas, exotic locations and whole cultures spun from nothing. The CGI is also topnotch, at least for its time, and you easily believe that these fantastically weird creatures walk the face of Mars.Unfortunately, that some complexity also works against the film. It gets lost in the details and weirdness of its very premise. A lot of the time you're too busy wondering what these new creatures are all about to have time to follow the plot. In the book you have time to get to know them - and even then you sometimes feel like it's a bit much - but in a movie you simply don't have time for it. Too many sides, too many players working against one another. There's at least four different sides to this war and none of them are explained that well.Still, it looks pretty, has that good old fashioned pulp adventure feel to it, the action scenes work nicely and overall it's a perfectly watchable film. Nothing major or groundbreaking, but I don't think you'll regret seeing it if you're looking for a solid adventure film.",John Carter

49,freemantle_uk,A Lukewarm Sci-fi Adventure,5,3 August 2013,"Edgar Rice Burroughs of John Carter of Mars novels are often considered one of the fathers of modern sci-fi, influencing the likes of Star Wars and Flash Gordon. It was a project that was in development hell for years before Disney made it into a big budget action adventure film. Unfortunately for Disney John Carter is considered one of the biggest big office bombs in history and it has earned that distinction for good reason.In 1868 John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is a grief stricken former Captain in the Confederate Army and mining for gold in Arizona. When fleeing from some anger Apaches John Carter stumbles into a cave and ends up being teleported to Mars. He finds out Mars is called Barsoom by the locals and that the two human civilisations, Helium and Zodanga are at war with each other are at war with each other and the brutal leader of Zodanga, Sab Than (Dominic West) is on the verge of winning, forcing a marriage with Helium's heir, Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). John Carter ends up with a third race, the Tharks, a brutal strong race of green aliens with four arms and trucks. John Carter wants to return to Earth but he is a wanted man because of his abilities of super strength and jumping on the planet.It is clear director Andrew Stanton wanted to make a fun light hearted swashbuckling adventure with the occasion moment of darkness. But the despite the cast of respected actors and millions of dollars spend on the film John Carter is a surprisingly dull and outdated film. The effects of John Carter jumping around on Mars looked cheesy and more like an early attempt of someone trying to do Superman and whilst the airship battles do look impressive and the animators do a good attempt at giving the Tharks individual looks the CGI is still ropey. The action itself is bland and lacks invention: the best parts were the ship battles and superheroics, but it nothing that you haven't seen before. The film even has a dog like creature that follows John Carter and can run as flash as the flash which feels like a throwback.The film cost an estimated $250 Million, plus advertising, but it is hard to see where they spend the money. This is a film lacking any real star power (this is hardly a film with a Tom Cruise or Will Smith). John Carter was for the mostly filmed in Utah and it shows. The film just looks like it was filmed in the desert and just looked like Earth. Somewhere like Ayers Rock in Australia would have looked liked the Martian landscape and the film could have done something basic, like make the sky red. The film is most visually engaging when we are on historical Earth and the air ships.There are some positives to the film. The first is that Tharks do look alien and their culture is very brutal, it makes the Spartans from 300 look like they could win parenting of the year award. It was a real clash of cultures, though John Carter was a 19th Century man, so the radically different aliens should be even more of a shock when he sees the Tharks. Michael Giacchino also supplies another excellent score and add to his filmography.Kitsch does offer an almost Clint Eastwood element to his delivery when we meet him in 1868 and his performance was better to his roles in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Battleship. Collins (another X-Men Origins: Wolverine alumni) supplies a surprisingly decent English accent and most of the cast is solid.Despite the source material being so influential the adaptation ends up being a fairly weak adventure and space opera. It is not as much fun as it wanted to be and it makes more appreciate films like Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean a little more.",John Carter

They probably could have made another 100 million dollars if they left in the ""of Mars"" on the title. Anyways, this movie is one of the greatest spectacle to be made for a movie, and dare I say that it's the movie that most closely captured the excitement of the original Star Wars trilogy ? There's nothing that even comes close to it made in the past 10 years.I truly hope that Disney will make a trilogy out of it.",John Carter
51,JoeB131,Mediocre and Disney are becoming interchangeable words,4,5 August 2012,"I watched this film and felt nearly no emotional investment in it. I simply didn't care if John Carter prevailed or not.So what you had here was two hours of fantastic special effects with characters which were written in such a flat way that you were not invested in them at all.The plot was faithful to the books, I guess, but there's simply a lot of stuff going on, and you don't care. Things were kind of predictable. For instance, when they told you that leadership of the Tharks is determined by trial by combat, you knew that was going to happen eventually.The Tharks looked nice, but the rest was a bit over the top on the CGI.",John Carter
52,XweAponX,NO ROOM for Purism,10,1 June 2012,"If you are a purist you will despise this movie: But you hated Lord of the Rings and I, Robot which were faithful adaptations of those works. I've determined that when it comes to film adaptations of these classic books, there is no room for Purism. There always has to be a compromise. Nevertheless, the filmmaker got all of the basic tenets of ""A Princess of Mars"" covered in this incredibly visual and textile film.The MARS in this film is NOT the Mars that the landers had filmed - It is not the Mars that exists today. This is Percival Lowell's Mars, it is Edgar Rice Burrough's Mars. It is the Mars of Dejah Thoris and John Carter.A Sub-Plot regarding the ""Therns"" works for me as an explanation of how and why Mars is a lifeless chunk of rock, in the year 2012 but had at least 3 races of people living on it in the years when Burroughs came up with the base story. It also shows how Carter came to ""be"" on Mars in the first place. There needs to be no scientific explanations: Especially when as a general rule, advanced sciences will appear to be ""magic"" until the processes are understood.Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Helium, has discovered such a science: The 9th Ray, which can be used as a Power source and even help recover the wasteland areas of the planet.And this film does transport you from the wastelands of ""Arizona"" (Which were actually Utah-Probably Monument Valley) to the wastelands of Barsoom.BARSOOM! In a way this has nothing to do with that little speck of light we see in our night sky: This is the planet Barsoom.And the film begins with a battle involving the fliers Burroughs thought up - Visually, they are just how Burroughs described them, and in detail when Larry Niven used them in his book ""Rainbow Mars""Taylor Kitsch, ""Gambit"" of ""Wolverine"" is John Carter - Who has had enough of War and fighting on a losing side. He does not wish to be dragged into a fight that is not his. Lynn Collins, also from ""Wolverine"" is Dejah Thoris, she IS Dejah Thoris, she is a princess, absolutely majestic in this portrayal. Mark Strong, ""Sinestro"" from ""Green lantern"" is the main Thern and perennial bad guy, And Samantha Morton and William Dafoe are Solas and Tars Tarkas respectively. How the animators got those actors' characteristics onto Tharks is beyond me.This is a beautiful, epic picture, full of wonder and imagination, on a Mars landscape that is wholly believable and real. We really believe we were transported to the 4th Planet.I watched this with mouth agape, and savored every moment of it. I highly anticipate its release on DVD/Blu ray, so I can enjoy it again. And again, and again.High Praise to Andrew Stanton for tackling this huge scale and scoring a win, in my opinion.From 19th century London, to Arizona, to Barsoom and back, each ""location"" is believable as how it would have appeared in the years depicted.It is my high hope that Disney will make the OK for the planned sequels - This is a story that MUST be continued.",John Carter
53,MBunge,"Lynn Collins is wearing far too much clothing, but it's a really good film anyway!",7,12 March 2012,"It's a long, long, loooong time in coming, but fans of Edgar Rich Burroughs' other great creation finally have a movie to call their own and it's one of which they can be proud. John Carter is a fun, funny, exciting and visually spectacular journey into the world of Barsoom. If it's not quite as perfect as the first big screen adaptation of Robert E. Howard's great barbarian, this thing stands head and shoulders above the horde of other classic characters that have been brought to cinematic life only to bitterly disappoint fans and the general public.For the uninitiated, John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is a Virginia gentleman-soldier who heads west after the Civil War and finds himself transported to the planet Mars, known to its inhabitants as Barsoom. Once there, he finds himself capable of astounding leaps thanks to the lower gravity and air pressure, joins in with the savage, six-limbed Tharks, befriends their honorable leader Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe), falls in love with the incomparable Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) and helps her defend her city-state of Helium from the conquering general Sab Than (Dominic West) and the mysterious priesthood of Therns who support him. With the help of a female Thark named Sola (Samantha Morton) and a faithful Martian hound named Woola, John Carter discovers the secrets of Barsoom and raises his sword arm in the defense of his princess of Mars.For ERB fans, this is a great telling of the first John Carter novel with a few elements mixed in from the later books. Everybody isn't naked and there are a few other Disneyfied touches, but a love of the original material shines through the whole movie. Taylor Kitsch is a fine Carter and Lynn Collins is very good as Dejah Thoris, bringing just the right blend of exotic beauty, intelligence and regal command to the role. Ciaran Hinds is suitably noble as the Jeddak of Helium, Tardos Mors, and James Purefoy completely steals the only big scene he has as Helium general Kantos Kan. Dominic West give a good bit of depth to Sab Than, only to have the script undercut his performance in the end, and Willem Dafoe and Samantha Morton give great voice to their computer generated characters. In fact, I don't think there was a single bad performance in the whole film.As for the story, maybe they could have dispensed with the scenes on Earth involving Edgar Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara). I liked them, but it would have gotten the movie off to a faster start and provided for a less convoluted ending. They also might have made the whole plot of the Therns a little more explicable and made sure all the elements of the plot tied together a bit tighter. But these filmmakers mostly did a nice job of establishing the motives pushing their main characters forward and provided plenty of action, humor and a touch of romance, all well balanced and with a real sense of dramatic pacing and rhythm. This is a quality bit of adventure cinema that fans of the original books will love and everyone else can sit back and enjoy.The special effects are, of course, amazing and achieve a distinct look and feel that is often the hardest thing with CGI technology. I feel sorry for people who saw the advertising for John Carter and decided to pass on it because they felt they'd seen this same movie so many times before. True, there have now been so many of these CGI bonanzas that they've all started to blend together. However, director Andrew Stanton effectively draws on the singular imagination of ERB to create a world and characters that aren't just another version of previous special effects.This is a film that people should go see, though as I write this it doesn't appear they are. The undiscriminating multitude who tromped to the theater to watch the Transformer flicks, which are nothing but 2+ hours of Michael Bay slapping the audience in the face with his penis, appear to have taken a pass on John Carter. Well, 50 years from now, no one will remember those Transformer movies for anything except what awful pieces of excrement they were. 50 years from now, people will still be watching this film and they'll love it. Congratulations to Stanton, Kitsch, Collins and everyone involved.",John Carter
54,estebangonzalez10,Better than what the trailer makes you believe it is,6,30 May 2012,"¨Did I not tell you he could jump!¨John Carter was one of the biggest box office disappointments of the last decade, and it's too bad because it actually isn't that terrible. I actually enjoyed most of it thanks to the spectacular visuals and the interesting science fiction story. I had the same reaction with John Carter as I did with Avatar, I didn't find them to be great movies, but I didn't hate them either. This film was directed by the creator of Finding Nemo and Wall-E, two hugely successful films, so I guess they can forgive Andrew Stanton for the loss. Stanton proves he can manage the artistic side of his films, but I think what John Carter lacked was a little more comedy to loosen the tension. Sometimes it's good in these type of fictional films to lighten up the mood by not taking itself too seriously. That was the biggest error I found in John Carter, it took itself way too seriously when the premise actually is a little ridiculous. I did have a lot of fun however with the action scenes and the spectacular visuals. John Carter is actually based on the stories written by Edgar Rice Burroughs over a century ago, ¨A Princess of Mars¨. These stories had a great impact and influenced other writers' imaginations for such works as Superman, Flash Gordon, and Avatar. John Carter should have been better distributed as most people had never heard of it before and probably thought it was just a copy of all these past science fiction films. It wasn't a great film, but it deserved a lot more recognition than what it received.The story takes place during the late 1860's while America was facing a Civil War. Captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) had withdrawn from the war and was searching for gold in a hidden cave. When an Officer named Powell (Bryan Cranston) comes searching for him to join his cavalry, Carter flees once again only to be caught in the middle between Powell's men and some Apache Indians. Carter ends up hiding in a cave and discovers the gold he had been looking for, but out of nowhere a mysterious man shows up with some sort of device that transports him to another planet. Carter finds himself in Mars (or as the natives call it Barsoom) with no idea as to where he is, but he discovers that he can jump extremely high and long distances. A group of natives known as the Jeddaks led by Tars Tarkas (Willem Defoe) find John Carter and take him prisoner. Mars is in the middle of a civil war as the people from Zodanga are trying to conquer the entire planet. The only resistance is put up by the people of Helium, but the leader of Zodanga, Sab Thon (Dominic West), has recently been given a powerful weapon that can easily destroy the city. The weapon came from Matai (Mark Strong), who seems to be from the same species as the person Carter found in the cave. Sab promises not to destroy Helium if Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) agrees to marry her, but Matai has other intentions with the planet. Dejah runs into Carter and realizes he can be their only hope for salvation.The action scenes in this film are pretty interesting, but the movie suffers from not having some sort of comedic relief. At times the movie seems to move too slowly and it begins to drag, but the great visuals make up for it. Taylor Kitsch gives a believable performance, but we can't help but feel something is missing in this new world (perhaps a better supporting character). I still think John Carter is much better than what the trailer makes you believe it is. Edgar Rice Burroughs was a great writer and he had some interesting ideas, the problem is that this movie isn't a novelty as his stories were over a century ago. The sad thing is we now have seen and grown to love films that actually were inspired by John Carter. Burroughs also created the Tarzan stories and in a way John Carter resembles him in some aspects of the story. John Carter is worth a watch for what the story has meant and for the great visuals that Stanton has created, but there is not much more to it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",John Carter
55,sauravjoshi85,Had a potential but wasted,5,15 August 2020,"John Carter is a science fiction movie directed by Andrew Stanton and stars Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, Dominic West, Mark Strong, Willem Dafoe and Samantha Morton.Great and beautiful visuals, convincing star cast and superb opportunity but wasted and the reasons are poor execution and tedious length.Acting is good in the movie and as mentioned earlier has a stunning visuals. The visuals are probably the strongest part of the movie. Screenplay of the movie is poorly written and executed. It seems that the movie looses it's steam hence gets derailed from it's plot and never came back.The start of the movie is good and gives a hope of another interesting SCI Fi movie but as soon as the movie progresses it becomes more and more boring rather predictable and the hope vanishes. Climax is good but didn't excites too much as viewers might have already exhausted till the movie reaches it's climax.Taylor Kitsch was good in his performance. Lynn Collins looks stunning but didn't convinces. Dominic West and Mark Strong were also good.Overall this movie has a great opportunity to made a great movie but with predictable plot and poor execution I must say that this is an opportunity lost.",John Carter
56,r96sk,Unfulfilled potential,7,12 November 2020,"Unfulfilled potential, still narrowly liked it.'John Carter' can feel underdeveloped and underwhelming, you could even argue it aimed to replicate 'Avatar', but there's enough there that allowed me to find a fair amount of enjoyment.Taylor Kitsch is alright, I rate him, but a more convincing lead performance was necessary in my opinion. The rest of the cast, despite some well known names, fail to deliver anything noteworthy. Willem Dafoe works as Tars Tarkas, though only due to his distinctive voice; none of his dialogue etc. stand outs. The likes Samantha Morton, Mark Strong and Bryan Cranston give forgettable performances; arguably not their fault.The premise has all the possibilities to be great, sadly the film fails to make their mark with it. The ending is extremely rushed, even for a 132 minute production. Visually it's good, but that's one of very few plus points - I haven't got many truth be told, but anything less than a 3* feels harsh.",John Carter
57,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Fun, underrated Disney outing",8,7 October 2015,"Disney's John Carter was admittedly a dismal financial flop when you consider it's two hundred million dollar budget, and brings to mind the fiasco of Waterworld (don't any you talk schit about Waterworld, it's amazing). Poor marketing was a big factor in it; the film should have retained it's original title 'John Carter Of Mars', and spent a bit more on publicity. No matter. It's still an awesome entry in Disney's canon, getting to the root of what makes their formula so special. It's almost like an animated one that they just off handedly decided to make as a live action entry, and all the better for the story. It's based on old novels by Edgar Rice Burrows detailing adventures of the 'princess of mars', and Daryl Sabara plays a young Burrows here, slyly observing the fantastical story for future scribing. Kelowna's own Taylor Kitsch plays John Carter, a civil war dissident who finds himself transported to Mars after hiding out in a mystical cave. There he finds multiple civilizations at war, a beautiful princess (Lily Collins), an energetic race of many limbed aliens led by a cheerful Willem Dafoe, and a strange, hyperactive little frog/dog hybrid that's an adorable highlight of the film. The princess, named Dejah Thoris (everyone on Mars, or 'Barsoom' as they call it, has delightfully exotic names) and her nation are at risk from treacherous usurper Sab Than (Dominic West in full theatrical mode), and on the brink of war. John gains the trust of Dafoe's race, known as Tharks, and gets thrown headlong into the intrigue, involving all factions of life on Mars, and eventually, as is of course tradition, falls in love with Dejah. The plot trips over itself a bit at times, in a convoluted subplot involving all knowing, manipulative beings behind the scenes, led by Matai Shang (Mark Strong). Dejah's people look reminiscent to ancient Romans, so it seems appropriate that Ciaran Hinds and James Purefoy show up, as her father and lead general. There's also fine work from Polly Walker, Samantha Morton, Thomas Haden Church (bet you won't recognize them though;), and a crusty cameo from Bryan Cranston as a cavalry general. There's a sense of good old fashioned fun to the whole show, and a detailed effort that clearly went into the extensive anthropological world building (a huge chunk of the budget no doubt) which shows in the key set pieces. In a Kratos inspired sequence, John spectacularly fights gigantic 'white apes' in a Martian gladiatorial arena, and you can't help but get giddy when he discovers his earthly body allows him to leap hundreds of feet in one bound due to the planet's gravity. Great fun indeed. It sure as hell didn't deserve the travesty of a reception it got, and should have gone down as a shining, glorious success for Disney. Maybe my review will prompt someone to fund a sequel;) lol I wish. Check it out.",John Carter

59,kluseba,Highly entertaining popcorn science-fiction cinema for the whole family,8,17 March 2012,"John Carter is a solid and entertaining science-fiction movie. It convinces with a good dose of visually stunning special effects for the movie theatres without being too visual and overwhelming as other recent blockbusters such as ""Avatar"".Another strong point is the humour in this movie when John Carter first meets the Tharks or when he is strolling around with the giant alien dog that follows him everywhere. As these humorous parts are very strong, the movie should have even focused more on them.A good point is the acting in the movie that fits well to this movie genre and creates some credible characters as the mysterious Therns, the courageous and suffering Sola or John Carter himself whose struggles are explained in the beginning of the movie and several well done flashbacks. In fact, the first and last moments of the movie perfectly close the circle and are very addicting as they don't play on Barsoom but in the late nineteenth century in the United States of America.The movie also has some weaker parts. First of all, the story is overall rather predictable including the usual stranger in a strange land becoming a hero scenario. Of course, this movie is an adaption of parts of the three first Barsoom novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs that have been written almost one hundred years ago and have surely been quite original at their time. In fact, this movie makes me want to read these old classics one day. But the scenarists of the movie should have changed a couple and given these story a more modern, surprising and twisted touch. In fact, we have a weird letdown between a top notch production and an old school story. There are more negative things to say about the story. There are some plot holes of course but what I miss the most are some background informations. Why exactly was Sab Than chosen to be the most powerful person on the planet and obtains the special weapon of almost total destruction? Where do the Therns exactly come from and what are their purposes? What's the point of the ninth ray that Dejah Toris is about to discover? Many mysteries are left unexplained.Another rather weak point are the fighting scenes that are only based on special effects and not truly impressing. The choreography of the battles is rather ordinary and not always logically elaborated. On one side, John Carter kills giant white Martian apes as well as the powerful and vicious Tal Hajus or a whole company of Therns and the Green Men of Warhoon by the sword, on the other side he heavily struggles in some battles and must be helped by a princess or some associates in the beginning and end of the movie.In the end, the weaker points are not excessive and maybe more explanations will follow in the upcoming sequels if this movie is successful enough. What we have here are more than two hours of great entertainment with strong visual effects, sympathetic characters and a lot of action, passion and tension. Of course, this is the kind of movie that is produced by Disney and created for the whole family and might not please to those who expect a more brutal, complex or emotional story line but it's nevertheless a very enjoyable ride and I would definitely watch this movie again. Imagine a mixture of ""Avatar"", ""Dune"" and ""Prince Of Persia"" and you should quite know what you get delivered in here.",John Carter
60,davispittman,Disney does it again!!,9,22 April 2017,"I can't imagine why the reviews for Disney's John Carter were mixed at the time of it's release. It really is a great science fiction movie with great characters. Taylor Kitsch does a wonderful job playing the role of the civil war commander who accidentally gets transported to Mars and becomes enthralled in a war on the planet. The princess of Mars, played very well by Lynn Collins, is the princess of helium who is being forced to marry Dominic West (a man who has been given immense power by mark strong, a holy man, to overtake the entire planet of Mars). John Carter really is a great, very layered/detailed character and so are all the rest of the characters involved in the film. I love the chemistry between all the characters, especially the romantic chemistry between John Carter and Dejah Thoris. The action sequences are also very well done and I loved the special effects, I didn't think they had an overload on CGI either. I didn't get to see it in IMAX, but I wish I would have because the action and effects would've been great to see in that format. I thought the movie might would be a cookie cutter action movie, I especially thought that with the mixed reviews. But once I got into it I realized that this was not going to be that, but that Disney had outdone themselves once again. The ending is especially touching and you can feel that ""Disney feeling"", anyone who's seen Disney films knows what I'm talking about. 9/10. Great film!",John Carter
61,3xHCCH,Too Bad the Exciting Stuff Needed An Hour to Take Off,6,15 March 2012,"By this time ""John Carter"" had already received so much bad press, with people already calling it a massive flop at the box office. I went to watch this with the whole family yesterday despite all that. At least I am not expecting too much out of this movie already.""John Carter"" is based on a 100-year novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs called ""Princess of Mars."" ""Tarzan"" aside, I did not know that Mr. Burroughs had any other books, sci-fi at that, so ahead of his time, so I was interested. Here, a Civil War captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) was transported by a mysterious blue medallion to a foreign planet inhabited by tall lizard-like beings with four arms, where he could ""leap tall buildings in a single bound"". This planet turns out to be Mars, and he gets involved in its political turmoil as he rescues Dejah, the plucky and scientific-genius princess of the Helium tribe.The set-up for me took a little bit too long, and I felt the whole movie go by so very slowly. So I felt that was a really stuffy screenplay by Director Andrew Stanton (who also wrote and directed a number of Pixar classics like ""Nemo"" and ""Wall-E""). However, the visuals and the action were all excellently executed. You can see where the $200+M production went. The sets, props, costumes and CGI were top-notch. So my final verdict is that ""John Carter"" is not really a bad film. It was very good when it is good. It is just unfortunate that the good parts would have to come after the first hour.",John Carter
62,drystyx,"Hastily put together, should have been better",7,6 April 2015,"There is a lot going for this classic science fiction story.Maybe too much.There is a lot of risk taking and breaking of art and movie taboos, and that's good. A lot of credible characters, and that's good.However, what isn't good is that it spent so much money on effects, and a good story is often better when told a bit simply.It's also muddled by poor editing of sound, which makes it look like it was hastily put together. One has to adjust the sound up and down throughout, and one misses half of what is spoken, unless one has closed captioning, which I didn't have when I watched it.Still, one gets the gist of the story. However, there looked to be too much of a desire to make this a grand spectacle, and too much a desire to make the evil creatures completely unbeatable. Their powers make them invincible, quite honestly, and yet with their superiority, their motivations are not credibly given. There are people who are evil, and whose only motives are evil, and perhaps that is the case, but it is not clearly shown.Perhaps this should have been done more Tarzan style, even if the story is quite different. Tarzan would be in an isolated area, with an isolated group, and we would get great scenery, but not popping too far from place to place with armies of this and armies of that. Sure, there were armies, but not delivered in huge spectacle which took over the story.The story should have stayed more basic, with the characters interacting more, and less abuse of special effects. But that's the trouble with most film making today. Special effect geeks think they own the movie, and dictate too much, instead of vice versa.Also, the movie begins poorly. We almost don't even care about the characters in the beginning. This is a common Hollywood ploy, to start with characters we can't like at all, and then control freak directors try to manipulate us into changing our minds. I never liked being manipulated, so I don't rate such movies too high.Still, there is a lot of good to the movie, and it can be saved with better editing and if someday they cut some of the special effects out and let the story be bigger than the geeks, and if they coordinate the sound better.",John Carter
63,slokes,Better Than The Buzz,6,14 October 2013,"As famous cinematic turkeys go, ""John Carter"" is an odd duck. It's actually entertaining, even rousing in spots, visually attractive, and well-stocked with fun performances. It's not even that long.The problem is just that it plays long.John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is a disillusioned veteran of the American Civil War who goes to Arizona in search of gold. He finds instead a portal that transports (or ""telegraphs"", as he puts it) him to Mars, a desert planet nevertheless full of sentient life. On Mars, Carter has the power to alter the outcome of another civil war; can he be persuaded to overcome his bitter reluctance to help?The main problem with the movie is labored exposition. After a brief taste of Martian battle, it's ten minutes before you begin to hear John Carter's Earthly backstory, and ten more before you get to the part about him coming to Mars. Ten minutes after that, he's captured by a warlike alien race called Tharks; ten minutes after that, he overcomes the language barrier and starts to adapt to his new world's culture, although it's another ten minutes before he actually inserts himself in Martian affairs, literally by leaping on a flying ship in mid-battle.After that, ""John Carter"" is rather fun. It just takes too long getting to the starting gate.Director Andrew Stanton, a fan of John Carter since it was a Marvel comic-book series in the 1970s, works hard at getting the world-building right. The spaceships here work like sailing ships on Earth, except they sail on light, and the fighters use guns and swords rather than lasers. Burroughs originally wrote the John Carter stories nearly a century ago, when lasers weren't part of the equation. After some adjustment by the viewer, this rather different take on sci-fi/fantasy begins making sense, but like everything else with ""John Carter,"" it takes time.About the only thing in the movie that has any kind of immediate impact is Lynn Collins' performance as the Martian princess Dejah Thoris. More than just being attractive and underdressed, Collins makes her character the gateway for the viewer to begin caring.The other human performances are mostly lost in the mix. Kitsch struggles with a gruff lead role, but has his moments. Willem Dafoe does a fine job as the voice of Thark leader Tars Tarkus. I would have liked to have seen James Purefoy more in the role of Kantos Kan, one of Dejah's allies, but his character only registers on screen for a couple of scenes. Mark Strong is more memorable as a mysterious Tharn, a race of immortal beings who enjoy making Martians and humans suffer toward his own inscrutable ends.""John Carter"" kicks into gear in its second half, with a couple of big battle scenes as well as a fight in a Thark arena which is a terrific stand-alone setpiece, with Carter chained to a rock and fighting two giant, blind white apes. By the time you get to the end, the film becomes a lot of fun, to the point where you get an itch to see more of this after the credits finish rolling.This may not happen, since ""John Carter"" flopped in the U. S. and only just made up the difference overseas. It's a shame; ""John Carter"" did a lot of the work toward building a diverting franchise for fantasy film fans, and it's a shame to leave that on the table. Perhaps ""John Carter"" will build up enough of a home-video fanbase to get a second chance, and a somewhat leaner, quicker-paced sequel?",John Carter
64,pensman,Burroughs would have enjoyed this,9,10 June 2012,"The failure of this movie is due to marketing. Back in the 60's Ace books began the release of some of Edgar Rice Burroughs works (Tarzan, Barsoom series, Pellucidar, Moon series) with many of the covers featuring the work of Frank Frazetta. No doubt those initial covers helped fuel a sudden popularity of Burroughs. Enough so that another rival company released official versions of Tarzan and the Barsoom novels. Even a contemporary of Burroughs, Otis Adelbert Kline, found a new popularity. But by the time I had entered college interest had peaked and Burroughs faded away again but for Tarzan. But slowly comic books featuring the Marvel universe gained popularity and fortunate Stan Lee lived to see his characters come to life in some spectacular films.If Disney had commissioned and released some graphic novels based on Barsoom a year or two in advance of the film, they might have built an audience for John Carter but for some strange reason they believed the character was out there in the collective unconscious but he wasn't. Well, he was in mine but an audience of one does not justify spending 250 million dollars no matter how much I appreciate the effort. And I did.The movie itself is beautiful to watch and the special effects are excellent and the acting is actually quite good overall but for an audience that embraces the familiar and eschews the unfamiliar, John Carter can be a confusing ride. Who and what are the Tharks, what is a calot, Thoat, etc. This isn't Star Wars which while unfamiliar was yet very familiar. Burroughs created a complex world populated with interesting creatures and while reading the books with a flashlight at night that world slowly came alive. On the big screen without any context, it came alive too quickly. I believe in time the popularity of the film will increase as some decide to watch the DVD and decide, Hey, this was pretty good."" At least I hope so. John Carter is a film that should be watched.",John Carter
65,Enchorde,Action packed Sci-fi,7,11 March 2012,"John Carter is just a entertaining movie throughout. Basically it is an action packed, effects based adventure story that brings treasure hunter John Carter to Mars, or Barsoom as it is really called among its natives, and thrown in the middle of a civil war. The cities of Zodanga and Helium are all that remain, with Zodanga on the verge to conquer Helium because of a new mystical, almost magical, weapon.Sab Than, the leader of Zodanga, offers peace in exchange for Dejah Thoris, the princess of Helium, hand in marriage. It is a surprising development, but Sab Than is only doing the bidding of the thern Matai Shang, who provided the mystical weapon. Dejah is less than thrilled about the plan and runs away.However, Carter is also in the midst of a power struggle amongst the thraks, a native people living in the deserts of Mars. He has his own problems surviving, not mentioning getting back to Earth. But his and Dejah's fates seem intertwined. It seems only Carter can help Dejah stop Sab Than and Matai Shang.As I said, this was an entertaining movie. Not fair to the movie, since its story predates both Star Wars and Conan, it can be described as a combination of the two. Apart from the action, which was really good, it also has a good story. Spiced up with some twists and not a little dose of humor and good one-liners, it is a movie I can recommend. 7/10",John Carter

This is the kind of film that comes very close to being one of my guilty pleasure movies. It has a silly but kind of cool premise; it has some ridiculous worldbuilding that feels akin to sword and sorcery b-movies (like ""Conan the Barbarian"" or ""Solomon Kane""); and it's a genuinely fun film even though the lead actor is stiff as a board and the plot is rushed and filled with holes.

68,Spondonman,Out of this world cartoon,7,26 May 2012,"What on Jasoom to make of this? As someone who voraciously read Edgar Rice Burroughs' fantasies when young and had probably devoured the complete Martian - and Venusan - series more than a couple of times by age 11 was this film worth watching? All I know is I will hopefully read the books again but probably will not sit through any part of the film ever again.John Carter, Confederate Army cavalry officer on Earth is wondrously transported to Mars where he befriends skinny green giant Tars Tarkas, falls in love with red Princess Dejah Thoris and swashbuckles his way through to saving the entire planet. So many liberties were taken with the story right from the start that I didn't think I'd make it to the liberty-taking end, but as the film wended its way I had to admit that it was made by people who knew their Barsoom saga very well and had tried to present it fairly faithfully; we get the gist. But why spend so much money on such a personal project and then veer away from the original stories? Just a couple of examples of important differences: John Carter declared his well bred allegiance to Helium straightaway without the wavering in here; well bred Dejah Thoris was incomparable, here she was feisty, chatty and comparable; the cliffhanger at the oxygen plant was jettisoned completely.It's an extremely well made noisy and swift expensive cgi cartoon with a 1080p screen full to the brim of ridiculous tiny leaping warlike shapes but Issus only knows what gamers got out of it. And although it won't concern me I do wonder how faded and jaded all these modern blockbuster cartoons will look in 50 years time. A time passer if you have the time to pass.",John Carter
69,Samiam3,A Disney turd,4,25 May 2012,"It would be easy enough to say that John Carter is just bad, but more than that, its badness is just so bizarre that it warrants some further discussion. For example, how does Andrew Stanton (the director behind one or two of Disney's best films of the millennium) come out with something that feels like the product of a confused hack.He has taken Edgar Rice Burroughs novel and turned it into a near-farce. Even with a substantial running length of two hours plus, the story is muddled and often feels completely improvised. It is full of lame coincidences, cheesy dialogue, unpronounceable names and confusing character motivation. The space operatic action scenes are merely eye candy. Worse then that, these scenes come out as kind of boring actually. Part of it has to do with the fact that the protagonists are too shallow to care and/or cheer for.This leads me to my next problem. The acting is terrible. The entire cast stinks of stiled delivery, the worst of which comes from lead actor Taylor Kitsch. He delivers his lines in a way that makes him sound like he's trying to speak up for the hard of hearing in the audience. Scattered across the over serious scenario are a few attempts at disneyesque humour. In fact sometimes it is hard to tell when the movie is being intentionally funny or not. The climax for example is a cacophony of mixed match art department ideas. It looked like a cross between steam punk and Star Trek with maybe a little Mad Max. At least there was a sense of colour consistency throughout the film, which helped make it a bit more visually comprehensible.The word that comes to mind to describe John Carter is 'rediculous'. I'm almost glad that this film was a box office flop. Maybe Disney will learn a lesson next time they want to make another epic adventure.",John Carter
70,jadepietro,"Yes, Virginia, This Movie is a Dud!",4,22 March 2012,"This film is not recommended.My first official film for the 2012 movie season is the new Disney film, John Carter, not to be confused with the 50's stand-up comedian Jack Carter, who was slightly more entertaining. Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom series that dates back to 1912, ( a source with which I was not at all familiar ), the film is as old-fashion as the pulp fiction dime store novels of its days and just as fresh as three day old tuna. After a short prologue about the planet Mars, or Barsoom as it's known by the natives, the film begins in the early 1880's. We first meet a young Edgar B., nephew to his Uncle Jack ( again, not the comic ). Edward, or Ned, is attending his dear late uncle's funeral where he receives a journal that tells of John Carter's life and otherworldly adventures. We again flash back to 1868, where we meet a young virile Carter (Taylor Kitsch ), a loner prospecting for gold, fighting Apaches, and Livin' la Vida Loca out West. ( It is at this point that I became discombobulated. Had I walked in Cowboys and Aliens, that recent sub-par hybrid of the Western and sci-fi genres? Hasn't Hollywood learned from that bomb? I must admit here that a gnawing feeling of déjà vu pervaded this film throughout my viewing displeasure, as I became inundated with countless variations to other sci-fi / fantasy adventure films. ) Anyway, John is finally transported to Mars and taken prisoner by the Tharks, a tribe of green four-armed, 10-foot tall creatures ruled by Tars Tarkas ( Willem Dafoe ). ( Shades of Avatar, sans the blues? ) Just as on Earth, there is a civil war brewing, only here it's between the Tharks and the Therns, a reddish henna colored tattooed group of warriors who now have a special weapon of mass destruction called the Ninth Ray. ( Well, life can get confusing on Barsoom or Mars, especially if you suffer from a speech impediment, but at least, your enemy is color-coded.) One of the villains of the story is Sab Than (Dominic West ) who is scheduled to marry the Princess of Helium, Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins ), a feisty Xena-like no-nonsense warrior princess type. ( Now at this point, I would have loved this character to speak in a high-pitched squeaky voice. Jennifer Tilly would have been a perfect choice. It could have been such campy fun to poke some humor into this bag of hot air, trying to evoke some originality and light-hearted fantasy instead of settling for this light-headed variety of sci-fi silliness, but alas, this purported blockbuster remains deadly serious. Too serious for its own good. Not to mention, I felt another gnawing sensation of yet another film of far superior quality about another gallery far, far away featuring a two-bunned princess named Leia. )And the bloated plot continued with still more villains: Matai Shang ( Mark Strong ), Tal Hajus ( Thomas Haden Church ); more battles and CGI creatures; and even a gladiator contest with two Albino Martian apes for the Roman Gladiator movie-going crowd. Plus, I forgot to mention Carter's ability to jump high, leap for miles, and land many killer punches for all the kiddies to enjoy. ( A further example of ripping off another equally dull and unsuccessful film caller Jumper and the more successful Spiderman franchise. )Yes, there is much action on the screen and director Andrew Stanton tries to sustain some degree of excitement in this fanboy adventure. But the film is an exercise in futility, a three- ring circus extravaganza, visually colorful but as bland as our hero's non-descript name and just as silly as any comic book hero. The film suffers from poor pacing as it lumbers from one adventure to the next. Major script changes were needed in the pre-production stage. Some serious editing decisions were also necessary in post production. ( It takes almost twenty minutes until the real outer space theme even kicks in. ) It also doesn't help matter that Taylor Kitsch is so one-dimensional, lackluster, and unappealing as the main studly hero. He sadly lives up to his surname. Major miscasting here.All the fictionalized and convoluted mythology doesn't make the film any nobler or grander in scale. The film's heavy-handed approach only make John Carter more of an epic failure at the box office rather than from a creative standpoint. Which is a shame because the film still marginally entertains, like the old Flash Gordon Saturday morning serials. Critics seemed to punish this film version because of its big expensive budget and lavish decors, but the visuals do have some nice details. One does get their money's worth, visually speaking. And in retrospect, perhaps Burroughs was one of the first authors to develop this fantasy angle that other modern day writers and filmmakers have since picked dry and left its sorry carcass behind.John Carter may not be the ultimate success that Disney aspired to attain. But it has a retro vibe that still will transport the younger members of the audience to enjoy a rousing good time spent with Uncle Jack and the Martians. It's the older mature moviegoers whose expectations may be Therned, I mean, thwarted, and they will want to say, ""No Tharks"", I mean, ""No, Thanks!"". GRADE: C NOTE: Leaps of Logic: Why did the Therns speak fluent English and not have a native subtitled language on Mars like the Tharks?

71,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,John Carter (2012),5,24 July 2012,"What made John Carter such a bomb? Well first, that awful title. It's just a name that means nothing to most people. Why not call it Barry Higginbottom, or George Doe. At least include the 'Mars' part of the story. Second, this is everything we've seen before. Not because it's unoriginal, but because the book is 100 years old. Of course other stories have plundered specific ideas and plotpoints, so to come and do a fairly faithful adaptation is just madness. It needed a fresh edge. The CGI is good and believable, but not really caring about the story leaves it all a bit worthless. The performances are strong, when not being too campy. Unfortunately Dominic West snarls and struts around without ever being truly threatening. The landscape of Mars doesn't really result in sweeping visuals. It's all dry and desert. Stanton does what he can, but feels more at home with the CGI creations. Unlike Brad Bird, who made a great jump to live action for MI4, Ithink Bird needs a better story to work from.",John Carter
72,p-stepien,The Mars curse,5,5 September 2012,"From the writings of Edgar Rice Burroughs (featured in the movie and played by Daryl Sabbara) comes an epic Mars story about John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), a Civil War vet in the XIXth Century, who unwittingly transports himself to Mars - straight into the midst of an ongoing war. Due to lower gravity Carter exhibits extra-human strength and the ability to move in leaps and bounds, thus making him a prized party by all sides interested in winning the conflict. Transporting himself just on the eve of the final battle Carter is forced to help Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) or perish together with the rest of the planet.Somewhere lurking in the back of my mind are the cinematographic travesties of ""Ghosts of Mars"" and ""Red Planet"", forcing me to keep ""John Carter"" at a respectable distance, despite the absolute admiration of Andrew Stanton's body of work. Mars being a quagmire for creators due to the overly developed knowledge about the planet, is kept at a distance by Hollywood for quite some time. Despite this Walt Disney decided to embark on a risky big budget journey into the adventures of John Carter and the once famed stories by Burroughs. However times have changed, Burroughs has been pulped, recut, rehashed and retold by pop-culture, giving little leg room for something truly original.Nonetheless the general story holds up well and despite occasional deja vu attacks seems relatively attractive, if not fresh. Despite a healthy runtime the story doesn't drag and end credits come up surprisingly unexpectedly. The generic feel does never cease to override admiration, but it proved an enjoyable, if unmemorable experience on a pure storytelling level. Despite the seemingly epic scale, it never seemed as such, as build-up to significant occurrences didn't build tension or a lingering feeling of graveness, making it feel relatively trivial in scale and easily attained (breakthroughs happen almost by surprise and not because the protagonists really struggled to achieve them). Nonetheless the unavoidable limitations in originality could have been overcome were it not for the burden of clichéd dialogues and some atrocious casting decisions.After years of Pixar brainwashing Stanton seems to be most at home with digitalised characters, where four-armed anthropomorphic Tharks and roadrunner shark-dogs give off more emotion than the entire human cast. And that spells deep trouble. Taylor Kitsch himself comes of rather fine, but seems inexplicably reliant on the strengths of supporting cast. Dominic West as ruler Sab Than and Mark Strong as back handling mystic Matai Shang come off strong and so does Kitsch when coupled with them. But the majority of the movie has him attempting to catch a connection with Lynn Collins... laden with so much beauty, but with such unbelievable emptiness behind her eyes. The ultimate miscast with the most blank desolate performance in a blockbuster in living memory - no emotion, no presence (save for her gingerly showing off some skin) and no interaction whatsoever. Hopefully Collins is heading for a much deserved Razzie next year - she sure as hell deserves the nod.",John Carter
73,rannynm,"Amazing Animation, Down to the Smallest Details",8,3 August 2012,"KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Gabriella Chu (age 15) reviews the film below: Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjj3xvF3Mp4From Disney's latest 250 million dollar film comes the exhilarating 3-D adventure of John Carter. This movie is based on the first out of eleventh novel of the series Princess of Mars, written about a century ago by Edgar Rice Burroughs. In this film, John Carter is a Civil War veteran who finds a medallion that teleports him to Mars. There, he makes allies and foes with the aliens he encounters and falls in love with the princess of Helium. At the same time, massive war is occurring between the aliens so Mars is in a chaotic state, and there is also an antagonist who tries to use schemes to put Carter back on Earth. Can John Carter manage to stay with his princess despite these obstacles? Writer and director Andrew Stanton wrote the magnificent screenplays for Toy Story 1, 2, and 3, Wall-E, and Finding Nemo, but John Carter is not one of his best works. Some parts are not well rendered and a bit corny, but I did enjoy the ending of the film because it's interesting and unpredictable, and I am sure this movie will become very popular. I also liked the main theme of the movie regarding to cultural differences. The movie shows how different the norms and appearances are for aliens on Mars compared to people on Earth, yet it is universal for both life forms to have good intentions. The CGI animation is also impressive, for it details even on the smallest of aspects. Its vividness combined with the 3-D makes the movie pop to life, particularly during the action scenes. The CGI animation is very compatible with movies such as Avatar and Planet of the Apes. The cinematography is also beautiful since the landscape of the film is set in the desert, which makes the movie more interesting to me since I rarely see action scenes occur in such an isolated, dry, and hot place. As for the actors, all of them performed their roles well, but I think Taylor Kitsch was especially well suited to his heroic character John Carter. I recommend this movie to teens 13 and older because there are a few violent scenes. The movie is a great family film, especially for tweens and some teens. Overall, the movie is an entertaining cinematic experience. There are a myriad of action scenes and the entire film is in 3-D, which adds a lot of depth making the movie seem realistic. You will definitely be thrilled if you're into science fiction movies and video games.",John Carter
74,Rob_Taylor,Sooo....What went wrong?,7,1 June 2012,"I think for a start, the budget was way too high. The movie looks undeniable gorgeous, but some of that $200 million would have been better spent on things other than CGI.Next up the marketing campaign, or lack thereof. If you haven't read the books it is based on, then the name ""John Carter"" means precisely nothing. The posters were bland and told you nothing about the movie. If someone had told me they were going to watch John Carter (before I heard anything about it) I would likely have assumed it to be a hard-bitten police drama, not a scifi epic.Finally the realization of the film itself. JC seems to want to be epic, but it also wants to be frivolous and funny. The resulting combination is confusing. I laughed out loud at some scenes, even when they weren't particularly amusing, expecting a comedy punch-line or visual gag that didn't appear. At other times, the humour caught me unawares.There is an opening exposition sequence that is right out of Flash Gordon, then the movie cuts to Civil War era America rather jarringly. I think the perceived need to spoon-feed the setting information in the opening scenes was unnecessary and did the audience a disservice. It would have been better to start with the introduction of John Carter and then give him the information later on, once he reached Mars, but hey! What do I know? There are some nice little plot twists towards the end and these, plus the humour throughout the film, keep it working, though only just barely. It's not a bad film. It's just...meh.",John Carter
75,pc95,Much Better than Reviews and Critic's Blastings,7,9 June 2012,"Disney made a big mistake by slapping it's name over another live-action movie effictively tainting the project. This time it's ""John Carter"", a maligned, mixed review from the critics plus a deep-sixed box office also had me stay away from the theater. But this isn't a bad movie. It's reminiscent of both Stargate and Cowboys and Aliens - and might be better than either of them imo. Yes it has some poorly done CGI here and there, but it's cheesy, campy, and loud in the right ways, and it stars Taylor Kitsch as the most Johnny-Deppish actor since Depp himself. It certainly has it's flaws such as it's pacing and dialog sometimes, but these are overlooked. Good sci-fi must have some fun sometimes, and this project that should've been handled with a fuller rating and without Disney 's name should've left it for Touchstone. Too bad because a sequel seems out of the question; recommended anyway.",John Carter
76,bob-rutzel-1,Entertaining,7,9 June 2012,"John Carter has died. His nephew, and heir, Edgar Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara), is told to read Carter's journal and he reads what is purported to be a true story. In that story, we see Captain John Carter trying not to be enlisted to fight Indians out west in the United States. He escapes from the US Calvary, and goes into a cave with spider markings. An alien materializes and is about to kill John Carter, they fight, and then Carter touches the now dying alien's medallion and he is transported instantly to Mars. (NASA needs to get one of those medallions.)On Mars (called Barsoon) John Carter discovers he has increased strength and the ability to jump great distances. This impresses the Tharks (CGI forms who look like Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars), who capture him. John Carter learns a war wages between the Helium and the Zodanga, both human looking forms. John Carter becomes a warrior in the fight to help Helium and also to win the heart of Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). That is all you really need to know and now you can sit back and enjoy the war games with the Helium, Zodanga, the Tharks and John Carter thrown in. The CGI visuals, regular stunts and the cinematography are almost as good as what were in AVATAR, minus all the blue coloring everywhere. Oh, there are some sub-titles to be read until John Carter gets the language down pat, and he does so quickly. No Oscars to hand out, but the entire cast performed well. Only real complaint I have is the music is sometimes too loud to hear what a character is saying. And, sometimes a character talks with a low voice for too long and this doesn't help understanding what is going on. But, I kept on and it made sense.. in time. Willem Defoe and Thomas Hayden Church were voices of some of the Tharks. The only star I recognized was Mark Strong (bald guy in all silver getup), the perennial bad guy in just about every movie he is in. And, I knew Taylor Kitsch from the Friday Night Lights TV show (great btw). I felt that Taylor Kitsch did a very good job carrying this story. I would venture to say we will see more of him in action hero type movies. There are some holes in the story, or questions you might have that are never explained or answered, but consider this a dream sequence with some alien magic thrown in where everything makes sense until you wake up. And, don't forget that John Carters's nephew, Edgar Rice Burroughs, is reading the story you are watching. The ending is quite clever as everything comes full circle. I found this to be entertaining despite some complaints about the sound.Edgar Rice Burroughs. Now where have YOU heard that name before?(7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only one GDI was heard.",John Carter
77,moviexclusive,"Scattershot storytelling, weak characterisation and unremarkable action sequences render this a middling action adventure good only for the most modest expectations",6,27 February 2012,"Why the venerable Disney would spend over US$250mil of their good money on a science-fiction action adventure set mostly on the Red Planet and around a protagonist with a name as nondescript as 'John Carter' was baffling right from the start, and remains an enigma by the end of this good-not-great movie. Indeed, a lot rides on a movie with such a hefty price tag, but given the successful transition that fellow Pixar alum Brad Bird made into live-action features with last fall's 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"", you might think that Andrew Stanton- the man behind 'Wall E' and 'Finding Nemo'- could also make a similarly triumphant leap.Alas, this big-budget adaptation of the first book- 'Princess of Mars'- of Edgar Rice Burroughs' 11-volume 'Barsoom' series will likely fulfil only the most modest of expectations. Like any origin story for a franchise, 'John Carter' carries both the promise of an exciting new vision and the burden of setting things up for future instalments. Not Stanton nor his two other screenwriters, Mark Andrews and novelist Michael Chabon, however manage to unshackle the movie from the latter bugbear, so much so that their film never quite lives up to its potential.And yes, there is certainly promise in the story of a Confederate veteran of the American civil war who goes searching for gold in the Arizona desert and ends up marooned on Mars right in the middle of an impending war. John Carter is this man, whose mode of interplanetary transport is a silver medallion he finds in the hands of a Holy Thern he accidentally kills in a cave on Earth. Once on Mars, John meets a nomadic tribe of Green Martians known as the Tharks led by the unusually empathetic Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe). The difference in the gravitational pull between Earth and Mars results in his ability to fly, and Tars spares his life in hope of learning his secret.Meanwhile, the two Red Martians- Helium and Zodanga- are at the brink of a war that could change the fate of Mars forever. The latter's leader, Sab Than (Dominic West), has a secret weapon bestowed by the Holy Therns, and to save the lives of his citizens, Helium's leader Tardos Mors (Ciaran Hinds) promises Sab Than his daughter's hand in marriage. Dejah's (Lynn Collins) pleas against her arranged marriage however fall on deaf ears, and her escape from Sab Than and his army ends fortuitously with a chance meeting with John. So as formula would dictate, John and Dejah will fall in love while saving the inhabitants of Helium and consequently the entire Barsoom planet.Well if it isn't 'Avatar' all over again, you say? The answer is both yes and no. Sure, like 'Avatar's' Jake Sully, John Carter is the outsider who ends up being the unlikely hero saving a civilisation from annihilation after landing on an alien planet. But unlike Jake, John plays the archetype of the reluctant hero that up until two- thirds of the movie had no intention of saving anyone save for getting back to Earth and his cave of riches. Does that make John a more interesting character than Jake?Unfortunately not- in fact, John remains quite one-dimensional despite a solid lead performance from Taylor Kitsch thanks to unfocused storytelling. Juggling a multitude of characters and just as many separate subplots with the Tharks, Zodangas, Therns and Heliums, Stanton shortchanges his audience's desire to understand John's transformation from selfish to selfless, and perhaps to an even greater extent the romance between John and Dejah that is supposedly the reason for his change of heart. Stanton's attempt to give each of these Martian tribes enough screen time also backfires- so much so that significant supporting players like Sab Than, Tardos Mos and the key villain Matai Shang (Mark Strong) are little more than stock characters.If 'John Carter' is weak on story, it is only marginally better in its action. Any hope for a thrilling mid-air battle between the fliers from Helium and Zodanga at the beginning is quickly dashed when it is over far too soon- and the same can be said of the other equally unremarkable action sequences. Granted that Stanton certainly lacks James Cameron's experience behind the camera, but that's scant excuse for the lack of build-up or excitement in the ostensible money-shots. Yes, while there is certainly scale in the sheer number of humans or aliens fighting on screen, these battle scenes do too little to keep you engaged in the unfolding mayhem. And that's just another way in which the film wastes the potential of its actors. Kitsch is a much more compelling leading man than Avatar's Sam Worthington, but his physicality and his emotional depth are wasted in a movie that botches both the action and the drama. Lynn Collins makes a suitably feisty warrior princess, though there are too few moments in the film to allow Kitsch's and Collins' chemistry to shine through. Pity the ensemble supporting cast- especially West, Hinds and Strong- whose characters are so thinly drawn that they are almost inconsequential.Yet despite its flaws, we must caveat that 'John Carter' isn't the disaster some pundits have predicted it to be. Those unfamiliar with Burroughs' story will find the rich mythology intriguing- though whether the film satisfies your sense of curiosity at the end is another matter. Stanton has also made this family-friendly, so younger kids will be distracted by the gorgeous production design as well as John's irresistibly cute pet beast Woola. But considering the budget and the talent involved, the fact that it is only a middling action-adventure is ultimately disappointing. After all, it says a lot when your impression of John Carter is just as indifferent before and after two hours of spectacle.",John Carter

Starring Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, Dominic West, Mark Strong, Ciarán Hinds, James Purefoy, Bryan Cranston, Daryl Sabara, (voices) Willem Dafoe, Samantha Morton, Thomas Haden Church. (PG-13)A US Army captain (Kitsch) from the 19th century gets transported to Mars, where he finds he can leap around like a flea circus performer and gets caught up in a war between rival civilizations. Both overlong and far too rushed, it's a case of too much story to fit into a single movie--the extensive mythology is dense and poorly explained, resulting in a lot of lumbering action where consequence has little clarity or weight. Kitsch, who comes across as a more muscular James Franco without the charisma and weirdness, is a pretty forgettable action-fantasy champion; he makes his staunch, heroic declarations with the same vigor as he does the line, ""The first item is beans."" Broad landscapes and (mostly) good digital effects avoid the eyesores these sorts of busy ""boys' adventure"" epics often feature, but too little humor, thin characterizations, and a lack of clear plotting add up to a tepid experience. It's possible that Edgar Rice Burrough's source material has been aped and cannibalized by so many other properties over the years that a long-awaited cinematic version of the original inspiration can't help but feel derivative and played-out.41/100",John Carter
79,mike48128,An Instant Classic! Ray Harryhausen would be proud!,10,6 March 2014,"""Somewhere in Time"" was a box office bomb. Critics hated it. Then, in an unusual move, it was shown on cable, and I think it was even re-released in limited run. It remains a ""cult classic"" and a ""cash cow"" to this day. This film also needs to be re-released, if only to IMAX Theaters. Starts out a bit slow, before John Carter ""leaves"" Earth, but stay with it. If the material seems familiar, well, it should be. The book, ""A Princess of Mars"", was written in 1912! Several Sci-Fi and barbarian combat movies owe their souls to this one, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs 100 years ago. It's Tarzan, It's Superman, It's Red Sonia, and Flash Gordon all rolled into one. It is original, because it was written first. One of the critics said ""why is there still hand-to-hand combat when the humans have spaceships and destructive rays?"" Well, there is also combat in everything from ""Flash Gordon"" to ""Star Wars"". The film has everything possible: good vs. evil, alien races, giant monsters, lovable dinosaur ""dogs"", shape-shifting ""guardians"", space ships, death-rays, gorgeous women, great CGI special effects. The hero is accidentally transported from Earth to ""Barsoom"" (Mars) and has super-powers of strength and the ability to ""leap tall buildings"" (among other things) due to lower gravity. He is not quite invulnerable, but heals very quickly. His true love is the beautiful warrior princess of the city of ""Helium"". He is the ""two right hands"" of the 4-armed Tharks, a race of superbly believable super-tall Ewok-type aliens (green, but not furry) that are hatched from eggs, and also have their own enemies, as if the two war-like human factions aren't enough. The CGI is beyond wonderful, as all manner of scenery and beasties are beyond anything I ever saw in a ""Dynamation""-Ray Harryhausen movie. An interesting ""twist"" is that John Carter's ""copy"" is transported to Mars, so his ""original"" must remain in ""stasis"" forever more (similar to ""Avitar""). Like ""Flash Gordon"", the beautiful princess must marry another, to make peace among the humans, but we all know that isn't going to happen!

81,saadgkhan,Badluck for everyone...,4,21 May 2012,"John Carter – TRASH IT (C+) John Carter is one of the most passionate project, which shockingly took almost 100 years in developing. I have hearing about John Carter from years and was eagerly waiting for the movie. Though, my expectations went down the hill when I saw its promos for the first time. In age of Gothic superheroes, it's hard to appreciate some adventurous hero entirely in the sunlight. The director spend more than $200 millions on the movie and up to $100 on its marketing. No wonder its considered the biggest flop in history and led to Disney's director resignation. The biggest problem with job carter is its friendly family adventurous bad sci-fi CGI look. From promos everyone could easily see that the whole CGI won't work for the audiences who are now used to watching Gothic superheroes. The movie becomes very tedious in the middle and may I say Lynn Collin (Princess of Marts) looked way older than Taylor Kitsch (John Carter). The yesterday's most promising young movie actor Taylor Kitsch is now deemed as one of the biggest flops ever. Not only John Carter contributed into his almost end of Hollywood movie career but his other $209 million release ""Battleship"" is considered as even bigger dud than John Carter in Northern America. Even though Taylor Kitsch did a fine job as John Carter but it's his bad luck that movie is not up to mark and towards the end becomes very cartoonish and not even Pixar cartoonish way. Lynn Collin as Princess of Mars is miscast, she did her part well but she looked older than Taylor Kitsch. Besides Princess of Mars was the most erotic and exotic woman in comic books and sadly she was nothing like that in the movie. I don't want to talk about anyone else it's just too tedious to talk about other crap performances. On the whole, John Carter disappoints in a big way and even though I gave it a C+, it doesn't mean you should watch it. There are few actions scene like watching John Carter jumping is cool but overall it doesn't live up to expectations.",John Carter
82,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,A pity the film never took advantage of itself.,5,8 October 2012,"I was looking forward to the bigger releases of 2012 like The Avengers, Spiderman and of course Batman. John Carter and Battleship just hung around in the background and felt like fillers for the big three superhero movies of the year.Now let me start off this review by saying that I never saw this film at the cinema. I saw it on DVD and I still couldn't understand Disney's confidence with the film. $250 million spent on what exactly? Story? No. Direction? No. Special Effects? Yes. Actors? Most likely. Editing? No. What ever happened here? Where did the money go? How did this ever get financed? You have the star of Battleship as the lead actor and he's surrounded by computerized aliens on Mars.This movie is okay. It can be fun to watch at times, but the movie is dependent on so many techniques and scenes that we've seen in other movies and better movies so many times before. How could millions be spent on a mediocre movie when you can find dozens of better told stories in Doctor Who? This is a bad sign for Hollywood at the moment. You know that if your space epic can't live up to Star Wars or AVATAR, you're in trouble. There has to be something the audience can relate to, something they can love.John Carter is not awful, but it could have been been made into a masterpiece. Disney, you disappointed us this time.",John Carter
83,Troy_Campbell,Dads and their young sons will enjoy.,6,10 March 2012,"Adapted from Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1917 fantasy novel A Princess of Mars, this family friendly Disney production follows the inter-planetary escapades of 19th century Civil War veteran John Carter (a solid if unspectacular Taylor Kitsch) as he reluctantly aides Princess Dejah (Lynn Collins) in her quest to save Mars (or Barsoom as they call it) from the malevolent Therns. Carter's source material may predate Star Wars and Avatar by more than half a century, but it's the influence of those gargantuan sci-fi epics that is most notable on the screen. The 9-foot tall, green, motion-captured Tharks are subpar versions of the Na'vi, whilst the sets and spaceships are very reminiscent of George Lucas' creation. It's these resemblances that hinder Carter's success – if you're going to be a concoction of sci-fi classics, you would really want to blow the audiences mind. That said, Dads and their young sons will have a blast.",John Carter
84,RNMorton,Holy Cow what a disappointment,6,13 January 2013,"Should I start with what this movie has going for it? Excellent if grossly overdone CGI special effects and a stunning (and I mean STUNNING) heroine in Lynn Collins. But I defy anyone living to explain the ridiculous twists and turns of the plots of this movie. And if you haven't read the books you have NO CHANCE. When I was a kid I lived on two fantasy authors - Tolkien and Burroughs. I probably read every other-world fantasy book written by Burroughs several times each, and there were quite a few. The Mars series was as good as anything he did. And it was somewhat involved - not as involved as this mess - but pretty involved. So what they SHOULD have done was dummy down the plot, make it real simple, enjoy the characters and go for the ride. What they DID do was make it even more complicated (with implications for life on Earth, at least I think...) and delivered this turkey. Bottom line - they could have done a far better job with much less on the plate. Small chance of any sequel to this cleaning things up, waste of a great series of books.",John Carter
85,TheUnknown837-1,Some things are better left alone.,3,28 March 2012,"Some things are better left alone. Last year, a classic literary novel, ""Atlas Shrugged"" by Ayn Rand, was adapted into a film after several decades of developmental chaos. And the results, as far as I am concerned, were disastrous. That picture made my Ten-Worst list and even though 2012 is not even halfway through, I'm sure another literary adaptation that was also left on the developmental shelves for decades, will show up on this year's rendition. The picture is called ""John Carter"" and is based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs story ""A Princess of Mars."" Not having read the book myself (yet!) I cannot compare the film to it, but the picture surely could have been left unmade, as it is also a disaster. More lavish than ""Atlas Shrugged: Part One"" but still a disaster. One that bored and frustrated me from start to finish.The movie has an infuriatingly chaotic narrative from the beginning. We start on Mars, with the two humanoid races of Mars in a furious midair battle. The fight is interrupted by some blue-skinned beings claiming to represent a Martian goddess, and bestow a terrific new weapon to the leader of one side, allowing him to start winning the war. Cut to 19th century America, where John Carter, an Army renegade, is unsuccessfully being coerced back into the service to combat renegade Apaches. Or something of the sort, since the movie barely scratches the surface of this opening subplot. He escapes, gets into battle with some Apaches, escapes into a cave, kills a blue-skinned being who appears out of nowhere, and is whisked off to Mars. There he becomes a pet to a race of four-armed green aliens. From there evolves a saga about a princess, a wedding, a continuing war, a portal, a grave that can only be opened from the inside, a boring love story, and so much chaos and confusion that I was left to wonder if the writers even knew what they were doing.The screenplay for ""John Carter"" was written by three people, two of whose past work I have admired. One of them, Andrew Stanton, also directed the film. In the past, Mr. Stanton has collaborated on some of Pixar's finest films (the ""Toy Story"" movies, ""Finding Nemo""). This picture may be the only fault to come out of that relationship. For Mr. Stanton, who has worked on many films that were done using a computer, seems far more interested here in what can be done with pixels than what can be done with a story. Part of the reason why the screenplay is such a muddled, bewildering mess is because the film is just too eager to show off what computers can do. Frankly, for me at least, that is a well that has long-since dried up. There's a lot of images in ""John Carter"" but not much imagination. None of the three races, flesh-and-blood as well as computer-generated, have any distinguishable personality. The green-skinned aliens also have steeds that look like amphibian cows, and yet presents them with no sense of interest. Maybe on Mars, they're a common sight, but for somebody who just came from Earth, surely they might at least generate a pause. The most interesting figure is an alien dog that looks more like a toad, and can run at supersonic speed. Make him the star, I say. The characters and what they do have no real purpose except just to be there. For example, one supporting character, a Martian princess comes up with a weapon which might help them against the evil warlord. This subplot is cut at the throat before it can be developed and never reconnects at any point later in the story. It's just dead air.The movie also lacks what the original story must have had lots of: spectacle. There is no sense of awe or majesty about Mars or the living things on it, again, because the movie is in such a hurry to jump from one subplot to another while showing off its computer-generated imagery like a test reel. The titular character, upon arriving on Mars, learns that he can jump like a flea on this planet. Instead of going for spectacle, the movie goes for cheap laughs with him falling on his face in a montage consisting of several silly jump cuts, and then a lot of ridiculous shots, where clearly the actor has been swapped with a computer-generated double. Then I started wondering just how he wasn't breaking his ankles and how, when early on just a slight shove could send him flying, later, when climbing a rock pile, a light jump does not put him on his tiptoes.Acting is generally bad, but I won't single anybody out, for most of the cast has done fine work before. But how can you blame them when the dialogue they are given is nothing but a succession of cornball lines? For that is where this movie ultimately founders: in its screenplay. Because the characters are so thin, the dialogue so bland, the sense of respect for the original vision so low, when there are big inter-species battles, and those blue-skinned beings shift-shaping in the midst, I found no reason at all to care what happened or who came out on top. ""John Carter"" would like to be a lighthearted adventure-in-space epic with a visual punch, but it left me bored to tears. And the visuals are not that punchy, for there was never a moment where I did not realize I was looking at actors superimposed against a computer screen.",John Carter

And while this is no way as terrible as say Battlefield earth, but it still misses the mark owing mainly to its pretty awful story telling meaning at no point did I ever care about anything that happened, or indeed any main character featured. This mixes up elements taken from historical epics, a touch of westerns, more than a bit of the Star Wars prequels, Stargate, just to name a few. And even at nearly two quite laborious hours in length it still struggles to fit everything it feels it needs resulting in a unsatisfying, uneven, and at times quite dull whole. I did though like the big headed dog/frog monster which I thought was by far the best character, and this is quite well shot, but besides that there's nothing really here to see and I'm so glad I never paid any real money to see it.",John Carter

There he finds even Mars is inhabited with life and people there call their planet as Barsoom. The villains here are the Thern's. Thern are supreme beings who are said to manage destruction. It seems they have their business only on planet Mars and not on Earth. On Mars there are two kingdoms Helium and Zodanga. They are at war with each other. The Therns fear the knowledge of Queen of Helium so they have their man at supreme post in Zodanga. To stop war and for mutual benefit the Queen is supposed to marry this man, in a bigger picture Therns want control. Now John Carter escapes fall in love with Queen. Further he is tricked and teleported back to earth. He now plans his way back to Barsoom and that sight lifts up the movie.This movie is highly underrated. After doing certain amount of research I found this movie is based on a novel written by Edgar Rice Burroughs named as 'A princess of Mars'. There are six more Novels linked in the series of John Carter. When I first learnt that I was excited for more movies associated with the character. It did not stay long. I soon learnt the first movie did not perform well when box office was office was taken into consideration. I still hope they are filmed and stay as good as the first movie.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Nicely directed by Andrew Stanton. One of more of his cool work is Wall-E. Music: Justified.

92,khanbaliq2,"John Carter is fun, charming, visually-impressive, but formulaic.",4,4 November 2015,"I'm not entirely sure why a film like John Carter flopped at the box office. I remember that I didn't go see it when it was released in theaters. I saw the trailer, but it didn't interest me. I didn't know what to make of it. There was Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) talking about a hero, John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), coming to save a dying world. Judging by the trailer, I thought that the film is a fantasy, with a few elements of science-fiction. With all the different creatures, airships, and heavy use of CGI, this film reminded me of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999). So, even though the trailer was good, it didn't hook me. I thought that the film is just another uninspired bore with a lot of computer-generated special effects. But then, a few years later, I came upon the promotional videos for this film, and I saw more of the trailers. I love to read and watch sci-fi, so, when I found out that John Carter is partly a science fiction film, I decided to watch it. The film is based on A Princess Of Mars by author Edgar Rice Burroughs. This novel, originally released in 1917, is an important early work of science fantasy. The story may be nothing special today, but it certainly was one hundred years ago. Edgar Rice Burroughs, the man who also created Tarzan, wrote several more novels in his Barsoom series after A Princess Of Mars. The 2012 film, directed by Andrew Stanton, is a mixed bag in my opinion. On a technical level, John Carter is impressive, though formulaic. There are several famous names in the cast (including Willem Dafoe, Samantha Morton, Thomas Haden Church, Mark Strong, Bryan Cranston and David Schwimmer), but none of them are particularly memorable in their roles. The special-effects are well-done and impressive, but often not visually striking or interesting. The screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon is burdened by exposition, and fails at good character development, resulting in a film with pacing issues. But, even with these problems, I enjoyed watching John Carter. It's not, by any means, a boring film. There's plenty of humor. There's action, though not quite enough of it. There's an excellent soundtrack by Michael Giacchino. And it's a visually impressive spectacle. Unfortunately, the film comes off as formulaic. Maybe this is due to its size and the large amount of special effects. So much money was spent on making it, that hardly anything in John Carter seems fresh and original. The Lone Ranger (2013) is another Walt Disney Studios release that has similar problems. I mostly enjoyed watching The Lone Ranger, and a lot of money was spent on making it, but the result is formulaic and not particularly memorable. So, if you're looking for a family-friendly film or if you'd like to see a grand adventure, I recommend watching John Carter.",John Carter

On Barsoom two factions are at war, the evil Zodanga and the peaceful Helium. Carter allies with the Helium faction and helps them turn the tide of war.Overall verdict: time-pass film.

Later, as I went out of the theater after having seen it, I was left saying to myself, ""Wow. That was one heck of an epic adventure!"". I understand that it's still doing poorly at the box office as of today and I know that the marketing was very poor, but I was left speechless at how epic and very heroic this film is.Andrew Stanton did a great job on the epic take of the character from the books seeing as how he gave us such great family hits like Finding Nemo and WALL-E and the story is completely faithful along with some great depth from the characters. Oh, and the directing is amazing, almost forgot that. It also has an heart-wrenching moment where John Carter fights off the Warhoons while we have some flashbacks of him burying his wife, which left me almost shedding a tear (spoiler alert).The acting, on the whole, is pretty good. Taylor Kitsch, although bland, did a heroic job as the main title character as did Lynn Collins as the beautiful Princess Dejah. The rest of the cast, including Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church, Mark Strong, and Daryl Sabara did great with their performances and the interactions between John Carter and Princess Dejah were enjoyable. It also has some of the most beautiful scenery and landscapes I've ever seen put to film and captures the same essence of the visuals from the books.The CGI on the Tharks, similar to the Navi Tribe from Avatar and although not photo-realistic, are amazing and they were as how I pictured them to be as is the Warhoons, Woola, a guard dog for the Tharks who is amazing that lots of girls will find him adorable, and the white apes in the battle scene with John Carter and Tars Tarkas. The strongest aspects goes to the thrilling action sequences and the most epic and beautiful music score from Michael Giacchino that gives the movie not only scope, but it's epic sweep in the process.Before I end this review, there are two problems. The pacing felt pretty uneven. It did start very briskly in the beginning and the ending is really nice, but the middle act is where it did drag a little too fast it didn't take time to breath. Also, the script is very convoluted. It crams elements from the second and third books and it would've been better if it only stuck to the first book. That's all I have to say.John Carter may not return some box office bucks to gain a sequel due to it's poor marketing, but as long as it will be successful in it's DVD and Blu-Ray sales, it will remain to be a cult film and to me, I'm recommending this to all of the fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs' fantastic work.

96,tomimt,Unbalanced and undercooked,7,14 March 2012,"I wont't dwell in the plot details, as I am sure you all ready know the basic plot of John Carter. Let me instead start by saying, that John Carter is rather unbalanced and undercooked movie despite it has been in development longer than most stories. The story itself is almost 100 years old after all.The parts, that work in the movie, do so brilliantly. The martian creatures are well made from the tharks to Woola and the great white apes. The set design is fantastic and the airships are majestic. Design wise there's nothing to be ashamed in this movie. The cast is mostly good, with the exception of Kitsch of who could be changed to an another actor if a sequel is ever made. But then again it might have been a fault of that Carter was as a character poorly written.The editing is also a hit and miss. The scenes with Carter in Earth in the beginning are in a word poorly edited. There's good actors supporting Kitsch there as well, but the scenes just don't work and the attempted humor there felt forced and flat. The score didn't help any and at places it just sounds wrong in other places of the movie as well.All in all the biggest failures in the movie fall entirely to the shoulders of Stanton. At places he drives to movie with skill, but in others he just seems to have lost his grip on what he was trying to achieve.And then there's the title of course, which is just plainly bad and non descriptive. A princess of Mars, John Carter of Mars or Hero of Mars would have been much better and interesting. But oh well.The movie is not a horrible failure mind you. It has its flaws, but all in all, John Carter is entertaining enough. The character has been introduced as has the world, so I do hope that a sequel would better this all up.",John Carter

The feeling of childlike nostalgia wins out in the end as it taps into those memories of your first exposure to ""a galaxy far, far away."" In the end, the movie does exactly what it's supposed to. It leaves you yearning for more. Pixar director Andrew Stanton does a phenomenal job helming his first foray into the world of live-action films. He does a great job leading the actors in the difficult task of interacting with objects and characters that don't really exist. There are parts where people who aren't familiar with Burroughs' series of books might get lost, but if you can just weather through it there's great fun to be had here.One of the most amazing things about this movie is how well the CGI stands up in high definition. There are a couple of parts that look a bit dicey, but for the most part the animation and live-action blend together seamlessly. It's a testament to the talent of a great animation director like Stanton. It also shows what we can come to expect from Walt Disney and Pixar in the future.",John Carter
98,Likes_Ninjas90,"I could make little sense of its existence, particularly in terms of style and character",5,3 March 2012,"This is based on a science fiction novel called A Princess of Mars, part of an 11 volume series of books from author Edgar Rice Burroughs. In the film a Civil War veteran named John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is meant to have died in the late 1800s on Earth. His body is said to be in a locked away and instructions are given to his nephew Edgar (Daryl Sabara) to protect it. This is because John has actually been transported to the planet Mars, or 'Barsoom' as it is called here, while his real body remains on Earth. Two human groups are fighting against each other on the red planet for the city of Helium. The baddies are led by Sab Than (Dominic West) who has been given a powerful weapon by some mysterious teleporting men, including Matai Shang (Mark Strong). With this powerful device and some massive airships Sab says that he will spare the city if he can have the hand of the princess Dejah (Lynn Collins). Meanwhile, John Carter also finds himself on 'Barsoom' too with increased agility that allows him to jump great heights. He also meets a talking alien species, Barsoomian warriors who are barbarians that take him in. Carter finds an ally in one of them named Tars Tarkas (voiced by Willem Dafoe) and with the help of these aliens Carter has to try and save the princess. Confused? The director Andrew Stanton, the man behind such Pixar films as Wall-E (2008) and Finding Nemo (2003), opts to throw you into the deep end here. The film holds your head underwater, all the while boring you with its own philosophical ramblings regarding time travel. Or maybe not. This level of self-importance masks what is essentially another 'save the princess story'. The film, which was a Disney production, is rumoured to have been passed on from several directors, undergone length reshoots, hedged back from a rough-cut that was said to be three hours long and the victim of an inflated budget too. I have little doubt about the authenticity of some of these rumours because as shown John Carter is ridiculously bloated, running unjustifiably over two hours long, with fleeting strands that make little sense to the uninitiated. I am not familiar in the slightest with the 11-volume Barsoom series and after this film I don't have any great desire to read them. As somewhat of a safety net and a relief, the film reminded me a lot of Thor (2011). Both films mix magic and technology and take place in contrasting worlds. But what's missing here though is clarity of theme, purpose and the playful self-referencing. The fans of the graphical novel are likely to take this film, and perhaps this review, apart as they will know the ins and outs of what this film is about. I wish the film had the same insight because I could make little sense of its existence, particularly in terms of style and character. The film shifts not only between time and place, which is confusing enough, but also drastically in tone as well. It is at times cartoonish, as Carter flies through the air and lands with a thud, but then incredibly melodramatic as characters rattle off longwinded speeches. There is no consistency to the film's art style either. At one moment the film is playing cowboys and Indians, then cowboys and aliens (it was going to come up eventually) then opting to mix time periods together. People are flying around on these airships dressed what looks like Roman soldiers. Why? There are even some gladiatorial references as the aliens seem to be a barbaric lot that enjoy public spectacle. If they were cinema-goers that might enjoy a film like John Carter and perhaps make more sense of it. On top of all this the characters, announcers rather, are incredibly elusive, particular Mark Strong. They are unaided by paper thin characterisation. Physicality aside, John Carter is not much of a hero because he favours growling over genuine personality but this is less important when Dejah is introduced as she is far more active and driven than most female characters of this kind, which is pleasing. Dominic West is still yet to find a cinematic vehicle that gives him the same level of charisma and hilarious smugness as his character in The Wire. A lot of his talents go to waste here when he could have had a lot of fun as the villain. On the plus side the film looks great, though in no part thanks to the 3D. Once again the extra dimension servers to line the pockets of Hollywood, rather than adding anything significant on the screen. It suffers particularly in the dark scenes because the glasses absorb any of the light from the screen. But at least the large open plains look outstanding when the film is in its cowboys faze, with high contrast lighting giving warmth and some visible depth to the screen. Superior animation also gives the creatures both expression and weight too. If I had to use my film critics powers of analyse and deduction, I would say that at its core the film is about the timeless nature of global conflicts, shared between man and...never mind, let's just cut to another spaceship blowing up.",John Carter

The titular character, John Carter, is a veteran of the American Civil War, but he lost his way after the deaths of his wife and child. One day in the Wild West, he's pursued by Indians. He hides out in a cave which magically transports him to Mars, where he now has Superman-like powers and is being heralded as its savior. Everything about John Carter just feels old hat. Sure, films like Avatar and Star Wars were partially inspired by the original Edgar Rice Burroughs' books, but the fact of the matter is, science fiction and fantasy have just grown in sophistication since Burroughs initially wrote these tales in the early 1900s. It's very hard to suspend disbelief in the idea that you could fall asleep in a cave on Earth and wake up on Mars. As well, unlike many other sci-fi films that came after it, we're introduced to three different alien cultures that contend with our attention span, each with convoluted, hard to understand customs, not to mention all of them having an affinity for big words that seem to have little founding in the English language. What films like Star Wars did, is they took our everyday customs and transported them in a dressed up setting, to where, while we were on another world experiencing fantasy, we believed it because the emotions being shown were not far from those that we might experience in our own lives in trying situations. However, even with all this, the special effects are quite good, as is the music by Michael Giacchino, but the rest of the film is not. Featuring a stilted performance from Taylor Kitsch as Carter, and many attempts at humor and romance that just fall flat, this is just a huge misfire from Disney.I give John Carter a 4 out of 10!",John Carter
101,Laakbaar,Sheer entertainment,9,20 April 2012,"I love movies like this. It's sheer fantasy, pure entertainment. For me, this film activated a primal part of my brain that remembered what it was like to watch ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"", the very first movie I ever saw in a theatre.It's got everything -- an alien world, strange alien cultures, terrible and lovable alien creatures, evil villains, heroes with super powers, damsels in distress, fantastic alien vehicles and devices, wild chases, shoot outs, and the list goes on. The story is fast moving and filled with action.It's essentially a Star-Wars type world, so suspending disbelief is effortless. If the fact that all this is occurring on dead Mars is a problem for you, you can just as easily imagine that the device transports people to the other side of the galaxy.Once you accept that Mars is not a dead planet but a rich and wonderful world filled with life, a variety of intelligent species and warring civilisations, and a world where humans cannot only breathe the air but are endowed with amazing powers and the ability to automatically speak the common language of this world.....well, all you can do then is strap yourself in and hold on for the ride.It helped that the hero of the movie is played by the dashing and very attractive Tyler Kitsch, who of course remains shirtless throughout. The best part is that I had no prior exposure to the story so the whole thing unfolded in front of me anew. Something you don't get with the Star Trek or Star Wars franchises.The negative reviews and unexpectedly low box office figures about this film came to my attention before I saw it, so I was a little concerned. However, there was never any doubt that I would see it and the movie worked for me. I suppose I simply disagree with the critics. I'm glad I didn't pay them too much attention. I don't really know why others didn't enjoy the movie and I don't care.Of course it was cheesy and reminded me of pretty well every movie I've ever seen. It would be impossible to tell a story like this without borrowing from earlier movies. This is a genre that has, unfortunately, been done to death. Yes, it was a mish-mash, but it was a magnificent, rollicking, visually splendid mish-mash that kept me thoroughly entertained. (Not blown away, but entertained.) I may even see it again.",John Carter

103,billygoat1071,Inspiration Comes To Life,8,9 March 2012,"John Carter is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel that inspires most sci-fi fantasy films. It's about time to make an adaptation of it. We may have seen some of its elements before but we still get to see some great innovations from its visuals. This is also Andrew Stanton's first live-action movie and he poured his heart and soul in this one. The editing paces too quickly in some parts but that didn't harm the wonders of this relic. John Carter is big and amazingly exciting.We don't get to see a lot of new things here. Star Wars and Avatar have already got the story's innovations to the big screen. By the way, this story comes first before those sci-fi movies. The storytelling is straightforward. Though, it had some weak introduction. In some parts, the editing paces too quick. It's kind of awkward. Especially in one scene when John Carter was about to challenge a Thark. It was suppose to be awesome or but it turns out to be unintentionally hilarious. Again, it didn't affect the wonders of this film.Taylor Kitsch isn't much of a great actor but he works better in action scenes. Making the jumping and fighting look exciting. Lynn Collins is good enough as the Princess. Ciarán Hinds is always a fine actor. Mark Strong does his typical villain performance which it's still effective. The best goes to Willem Dafoe. He manages to give a lot of depth to his character.The visuals are largely wonderful makes this experience much more exciting. There are plenty of fascinating character designs and places. The dog-like-creature is the character design that intrigues me most. I mean seriously, it looks great. Michael Giacchino's music is always classy to adventure movies. The action is exciting enough and large enough. The 3D looks converted but I don't know. Didn't notice anything coming out the screen but the title cards and the Disney logo.John Carter is totally a great cinematic experience. The story may not sound new to the cinema, but hey, it's a relic. We can still see something intriguing and fascinating. This film is just a reminder how Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic inspired most sci-fi fantasy epics. The point is just bringing this to life, give a lot of magic, and fun to this story. It's simply a big fun film.",John Carter
104,dragokin,"a flop, but not a bad movie",5,9 March 2014,"Before watching John Carter i somehow knew the plot but haven't be able to recall reading the book. I won't try to solve this mystery here, yet the literally template seemed to be potent. To my surprise the movie wasn't bad but the plot turned out to be Avatar on Mars.Now, when a specific product becomes successful there are other players in the industry that try to get their market share. In this case, Disney tried to follow up on the success of Avatar, but went too far in imitating it. The flop of John Carter goes to show how market research, or management gut feeling for that matter, isn't always fully accurate. After the release some top manager got promptly and rightly sacked, or as they politely say, he resigned.John Carter circumvents the obstacles of time and space travel by nineteen century mixture of science and magic. However, as the movie progresses you'll encounter motives that would inevitably remind you of Avatar. That is this movie's biggest drawback.",John Carter
105,TheSquiss,"A chaotic maelstrom of notions, story lines, poor acting and some pretty flesh.",2,17 June 2012,"John Carter: Big budget epic filled with action and thrills or John Carter: Endless, confused mess of unrealized potential? This morning, Chris Evans talked on his breakfast show about seeing the former. This evening, I watched the latter.It's a fun idea based on excellent source material (Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars series of books) with fantastic scenery (Utah standing in for Barsoom, as the locals call Mars) that has been transformed into a chaotic maelstrom of notions and story lines that are so unclear they prompt the viewer (this one, at least) to give up and daydream about a mug of tea and a good book at home. It's as though the studio, producers and scribes enjoyed the mother of all mud fights, using words instead of soggy earth, and left the splattered battleground for someone else to make sense of.I failed.Essentially, John Carter, a reluctant, decorated civil war soldier is transported to Barsoom and discovers, due to the reduced gravity, has the ability to jump, throw and punch with superhuman effect. He stumbles into a war between two tribes (or is it a three-way war, or is it four, or is it), refuses to fight, falls in love and fights. The film is filled with the usual, predictable characters: Loving father who is supposed to be wise but acts like a fool; demure daughter turned semi-naked siren; big, bad villain and cronies; angry hoards who make up the body count and may be called upon to save the day.There are some imaginative touches, moments of excitement, beautifully constructed sets and CGI that is mostly convincing but those high points cannot compensate for the overall clutter of the film. Accents veer between various American, classical English, cod-British and imagined Martian - within the same tribes! The range of acting styles and ability on display encompasses comfortably convincing (Ciaran Hinds), satisfactorily entertaining (Samantha Morton, Willem Dafoe), diluted panto (Mark Strong, Dominic West), bland (Taylor Kitsh) and wooden (Lynn Collins).At two hours and twelve minutes, it is at least 30 minutes too long, purely because it's a mess. Well written, directed and acted I'd have happily enjoyed three hours of Barsoom but I won't encourage anyone to endure the mess I witnessed.John Carter is not an awful film by any means. Your nine-year old son will buy into it completely and there is enough flesh on display to pass the time but it's difficult to escape the feeling that it's just an expensive, second rate mélange of better films: One part Star Wars, one part Avatar, one part 10,000 BC all mixed in a big bucket an spilt on the floor.If you're looking for fantasy adventure with substance, avoid the blend and opt for the single malt that is Lord of the Rings.Another film review from The Squiss.

106,davidgee,Stunning CGI but a slow script,7,15 March 2012,"This is mean to be a sort of TARZAN GOES TO MARS, but despite the $250 million budget, the film goes flat from time to time. The CGI sets, Martian cities and palaces and landscapes, are stunning - almost up there with LORD OF THE RINGS - but the script keeps stopping to give us heavy chunks of exposition.The battle and chase scenes, when they come, are as thrilling as in any other space opera. It's the inbetween stuff that is yawn-inducing. The hero, Taylor Kitsch, comes with designer muscles and artfully dishevelled hair but he lacks the charisma that Jake Gyllenhaal (or even Arnold Schwarzeneggar, a few years back) could have brought to the role. Lynn Collins makes a feisty princess, perhaps a tad too sophisticated for our Rent-A-Hunk hero.FLASH GORDON meets CLASH OF THE TITANS. Quite a jolly mixture but the blender needed to be on a higher speed.",John Carter
107,grendelkhan,A great B-Movie; too bad it cost more than most A-films!,7,5 January 2014,"I was a big fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars stories, when I first read them as a teenager. They are filled with adventure and wonder, moving breathlessly from one cliffhanger to the next. You didn't get a ton of character development, but there was enough to make you connect to the hero and his friends. So, I have waited years to see something like that on screen. When I heard this was finally happening, I couldn't wait to see how they would render the Tharks and the aerial navies, not to mention Carter's heightened abilities. I also wondered how they would handle the episodic nature of the source material.I missed the film in theaters but heard the lackluster reviews and dismal box office. Still, I was a big enough fan to want to see it and waited for rental. Well, I was pleasantly surprised.The film isn't likely to win awards, but neither was the source material. Instead, it delights in presenting us a world of high adventure and strange creatures. It gives us an old-school hero who fights against massive odds because that is what heroes do. It delights in giving us thrills and a bit of intrigue, without coming across as pompous or self-satisfied. In short, it has fun and tells a bang-up story. Would that more films could do this.This could have easily have been just mindless action; but, Andrew Stanton and Michael Chabon had enough respect for the source material to actually give us some plot and character motivation. These characters come alive because they are given real personalities, despite weird names, like Tars Tarkas and Dejah Thoris. They are helped by some good performances from seasoned actors (Cirian Hinds and Mark Strong) and a decent one in lead Taylor Kitsch. Kitsch is a bit wobbly at first (much like Carter, when he arrives on Mars) but he finds his footing as the story progresses and gets you to cheer for the hero.What ends up sinking this film is a studio who wanted a blockbuster franchise, rather than an entertaining film. They got the entertaining film but the chances of more are slim to none. The audience was conditioned to expect something epic and weren't satisfied to get something fun. Their loss, I say. I think time will be much kinder to this film, as people discover that good old fashioned adventure still lives.",John Carter
108,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Of Time And Mars,4,10 March 2012,"This two hour and twenty minute film, based on the story by Edgar Rice Burroughs written in 1912, would have made a terrific Western. Starting out with our rugged hero John Carter, a rogue confederate soldier seeking a mountain of gold. He's captured by Yankees and they can't keep him pinned down. The boundless action is fast paced and exciting, Taylor Kitsch displaying the right amount of lean bravado and swift agile.But then something happens.Finding an emulate, Carter is transformed into a strange world that doesn't look much different than the flatlands of America: except there are green creatures bursting from eggs and giant, lanky aliens with four arms. And Carter himself has a powerful skill of leaping a hundred feet into the air.The plot's quite familiar: a beautiful princess is forced to marry a swarthy scoundrel in order to save her race. Declining that option, she winds up with Carter, who's been taken in with the tall green aliens (the endearing leader voiced by Willem Defoe) and after a few cool fight scenes, Carter and the Princess travel across the Mars terrain: each seeking a different location without realizing.Here's where the movie hits a long, tedious wall And by the time the action sustains you'll feel robbed by the ponderous bouts of dialog describing the history of the planet, why it's doomed and who's dooming it. Thus a scene where Carter battles a formidable beast in a Roman like coliseum is too little, too late.But after all's said and done and we return back to Earth – the final fifteen minutes is as intense as the intro. Making it ironic that a film originally titled JOHN CARTER OF MARS would have been better off spending much less time there.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",John Carter
109,richieandsam,Nowhere near as bad as I thought it was going to be... quite good really.,6,30 June 2013,"JOHN CARTERYou know what... this might have been a massive flop, it might have lost Disney so much money, it might have been slated by everyone I know and every movie critic I have heard of... but I didn't think it was that bad... It's not great, but it's OK.The movie is about a guy who accidentally gets transported to Mars where the planet is is about to go to war. He becomes a prisoner to these 12 foot creatures and must escape... along the way he meets a few different characters and he gets caught up in the war. Oh, and he also can super jump and has super strength too (I don't know why).OK... let's start with the bad stuff. It was not that easy to follow. For a lot of the movie, me and my friends had no idea what was going on. The story was very patchy... I thought it could have been a lot better if the story ran smoother that it did. It was all over the place. The acting was not great. Some of the actors just tried too hard and it showed as they were over the top.The good things. The creatures/aliens were awesome. I liked the way they looked. The design of them was well done. It had a Star Wars feel to the creatures, although the main 12 foot ones look like Abe from Oddworld. There were a very good variety of different creatures too. Some of the acting was very good... but it is never a good thing when the best character from the movie is a computer generated dog creature. He was cool. :)There was some really good action scenes. The fighting scenes were very entertaining and I loved the fact that Disney could be a little bit more gory than they normally would be because the Martians blood is blue... so even though these creatures are getting slashed up all over the place, it looked like blue paint was splattered everywhere instead of blood.The movie stars Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins, Samantha Morton & Willem Dafoe. There are a lot of other actors in this movie, but most of them are covered up in masks etc. I only watched the movie last night and I only just found out Willem was in it. I didn't recognise him in the movie at all.I will give this film 6 out of 10.I thought it was an entertaining sci-fi film, it is just a shame it wasn't so easy to follow.

110,Al_The_Strange,The original sci-fi hero finally on film!,9,12 March 2012,"""John Carter."" Quick, name some of the best, most fantastic, most adventurous sci-fi films to date! Chances are that you might name ""Star Wars,"" ""Avatar,"" ""Stargate,"" ""Flash Gordon,"" ""Buck Rodgers,"" or any number of other popular or cult hits. If you did, then chances are also good that they share a common root in sci-fi literature; a hundred-year-old series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, featuring a hero named John Carter.After all these years (that is, years of production hell and filming rights being flip-flopped all over the place), Carter finally hits the big screen. With today's production values and technology, the results are certainly thrilling. The film moves pretty fast, with maybe just a few parts of drag. It's loaded up with gracious amounts of intense action, fight scenes, and battles. The special effects are gorgeous. There are parts that come off as ""pulpy,"" in a manner that could befit a story in the ""Heavy Metal"" magazine. But above all, everything works together to form a decent piece of escapism. By the end of the film, I felt I was effectively immersed in the world of Barsoom (Mars, that is) and its inhabitants.Most negative reviewers would target the story of this film as being predictable, uninspired, or convoluted. I don't know how close this movie is to its original book; there are indeed some parts that are predictable, and the story overall is quite formulaic; but I have no idea as to whether or not it's supposed to be this way. The most critical viewers expecting ground-breaking storytelling may be disappointed.Right from the start, the movie establishes itself as something fantastic (and specifically admonishes the notion that this would be hard sci-fi; those expecting total scientific accuracy will be disappointed). Understanding the fantastic nature of this story, there was never anything about it that hampered my enjoyment; I was able to follow the story and understand the world it took place in. Characters are not huge standouts, but I enjoyed watching them. It does its best to attribute some key themes regarding war and finding a cause to fight for.The film is pretty well-made, with quality photography. A few shots appeared to be sloppily-edited, but most of the film is put together well. Acting is not terribly outstanding, but it's not terribly bad either; I grew to enjoy Taylor Kitsch's machismo as John Carter, and Lynn Collins' attitude as the princess. Writing is really no better or worse than most other films. This production has phenomenal sets, props, costumes, and special effects; I really loved the look and style of the film. Music is appropriately adventurous.Given the mixed reviews this film has, I can only recommend it as a rental. But, I do regard it as essential viewing for sci-fi fans.4/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)",John Carter
111,rdoyle29,Well ... it ain't terrible ...,8,15 July 2017,"I wasn't crazy about this when I saw it in the theater, but I liked it better on second viewing. It's about 3/4 light, pulpy fun, and then a very long tedious action sequence and a lengthy completely unnecessary coda. That last sequence has a tendency to undo the good will the film has built up.",John Carter
112,cat_ranchero,Underrated?...,6,2 March 2013,"I think much of the negative press this film got was because of the enormous amount of money it cost to make. And yes, I can see it has extremely high production values with many exciting battle/chase/fight scenes all using very high quality CGI. I admit I have never read the Edgar Rice Burroughs 'John Carter of Mars' books but I'm sure those that have will have got a lot more out of this film than me. It's an exciting adventure that (I'm afraid) has a storyline that doesn't quite hold up today. Yes, it's visually quite stunning in places with some very exciting action sequences along the way but the plot is a tad too over- complicated, particularly for a younger audience, and the main premise that Carter can jump is, quite frankly, very weak. So, does it deserve the vitriolic reception it received? I have to say no; it is a better film than many have made out. Was it worth spending that amount of money on making it? Again, no; although it's not as bad a film as many have said; I still find it hard to justify the amount of money spent on it. Would I watch it again? Probably not; but I'm glad I did see it the one time.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (just watch it once)My score: 5.8/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",John Carter
113,kgprophet,John Carter from Pandora,6,12 March 2012,"It was instantly obvious why super-budget epic got green lit by Disney. They looked at the grosses of ""Avatar"" and saw boxcars for another franchise with JCFM. On the one hand, it is overbloated with eons of backstory and tying up loose ends. On the other hand, it is a multi-layered introduction of a franchise that leaves no detail unaccounted for (such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy). It is a little strange to have such a tentpole film to be released in March instead of the normal blockbuster season (May-August & Nov-Dec). There has been a negative buzz going around that the marketing was botched, or that the title was unappealing. I hope that enough word of mouth will boost this film's longevity, because compared to say ""The Last Airbender"", this is far better in many aspects compared to other failed would-be franchises.There are complaints about how hard it is to follow the story, but things were explained well enough that it wasn't hard to keep track of things. But I agree the multi-layered story lines get to be a bit much. One daughter is being forced to marry, while another daughter who doesn't know is a daughter is outcast from another tribe. On the other hand, nothing is convoluted when it comes to the love interest. And our hero follows the same journey as ""Avatar"" or ""Matrix"" or even ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Also handled well is the shape-shifting bad guy. Like Valdemort or other classic bad guy, he fits the role very well. Then there is the CGI world on Mars. Once again it is hard not to recognise the same territory that we all saw in ""Avatar"". As long there is coherent storytelling, I was willing to go along with it. There is only one scene I would cut, and that is when Carter is thrown into a jail cell at the beginning of the film, and he tells off an officer. The delivery is flat and the lines are painfully bad.But otherwise, we are taken on a sweeping epic that is lavish and richly detailed. It has a 'spare no expense' depth to the production, and the dialogue, editing, and music all kept the momentum going. This momentum is critical, because it runs 2 hours and 10 minutes, and there's a lot of ground to cover. I think the storyline could have been simplified a little, and try to clock in at 2 hours or less. There are about 5 endings that get to be a somewhat tedious, but it still left me satisfied.I went to see the 3D Imax version. Usually I am against seeing a post conversion 3D movie because it feels like you are looking at cardboard cutouts that are on a flat plane. John Carter's post 3D conversion is the best I have seen, especially in comparison to the lousy ""Phantom Menace"" conversion. Exhibit here massive tracking shots that rotate around subjects and retain their 3D depth as the get farther or closer to the camera. I read the director disowned the 3D version, so I'm sure the film is just as enjoyable in 2D.I definitely recommend this event film, because it will be hard to beat a quality product like this, even though the insect tribe on Mars isn't as cute and cuddly as Pandorans. I'm sure Disney is betting the bank on this one, and hopefully will get properly noticed.",John Carter

Some people called this movie ridiculous because of the science in it. It's a movie! A Movie!!!! Besides that, science CANNOT even prove their own theories.....everything is a perception of what we believe is true.So that out of the way, John Carter is a GREAT....GREAT....GREAT movie. It does NOT shove a love story down your throat. It's a movie about John Carter of earth and him waking up in Mars. Because of Mars low gravity, he has superman like powers. I actually think Superman was based on John Carter.The acting was great, the female lead was very heroic in her own right which is refreshing. In movies like Avengers...it feels like the director goes out of the way to make sure we know Scarlett Johansson is hot and a bad ass. In John Carter, we never acknowledge he beauty and because of that she is never SHOVED down our throats as a sex object.This movie is an epic that females and children ignored. Those same people who ignored this, SWOONED over that awful Man of Steel...SWOONED! John Carter of Mars was the real man of steel and a much better movie. But it failed because real men of the 80's action films and 40's have been replaced by the Twilight generation which includes me and women.Go see John Carter, don't try to prove you are smart because you know Mars atmosphere cannot support human life.

115,bluesman-20,A Tale of High adventure.,10,28 March 2012,John Carter is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs A PRINCESS OF MARS. Having read the John Carter of Warlord of Mars series as a kid my view of the movie is that it is almost flawless. The plot is strong the acting is great and the special effects complete the picture taking us back to Barsoom. The plot is simple in it's nature. Captain John Carter is trapped in a cave by hostile apaches while there he sees a strange figure approach him and Carter shoots him the figure drops a medallion off it's hands and Carter picks it up as he does so he finds himself falling asleep under a mysterious gas. When he awakes he finds himself on Mars how he got there is mystery but Carter discovers that the Martian planet has given him strange abilities. He is witnessed using his powers by Tars Tarkas and his band of Tharks who decide carter could be used as a weapon of war. Carter has other ideas . And When he meets Dejoris the Princess of the Title Carter still wants to go home but Dejoris soon recruits Carter into her cause freeing her city and Barsoom from ruthless Raiders who want nothing more then the death of the planet so they can feed off the chaos. While fighting to help free Mars John Carter discovers his true destiny as John Carter Warlord of Mars. THe movie moves slow in some parts but the action makes up for it. There is considerable development and the movie moves for the most part at a brisk entertaining pace. Don't believe the bad reviews see it and decide for yourself. You won't be disappointed. If you like tales of high adventure as they used to be go see it.,John Carter
116,peterfmodel,"I love this movie, its fun and entertaining and keep your enthralled until the end.",8,14 August 2019,"The story, while based on the original books, has been modified for the big screen and in this case the modifications work very well. The only weak spot is the John Carter character, the acting seemed a bit wooden but that could have been the intention. John carter is the ultimate straight man in this movie and from an era of southern politeness which is all but lost. But I still feel its not quite right, however this does not get in the way of enjoying the movie. The Dejah character is wonderful and is a classic example of the right way of depicting a strong female character, before the SJW's were pushing their Mary Sue's. This is another movie which can easily be re-watched, but a warning, if you want mindless adventure this may not be for you. You need to bring your functioning brain with you when you watch this; otherwise you will miss too much. I suspect this was why it was not so successful at the box-office.",John Carter
117,troyputland,JC has all the ingredients to be special..,7,1 December 2015,"Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings. Harry Potter. These are loved film franchises. All are unique in their own way. John Carter, unfortunately struggles to make its own way. Copying others is what JC does best.That's not to say it's dreadful. On the contrary. The story is decent; a headstrong princess on Mars is in need of help and a single man from Earth comes to her call. John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is dropped in to the unknown. Being foreign in a different world isn't taken advantage of when Carter feels at ease very quickly. The war between two human-looking races (differentiated by red and blue garments), and a marriage proposal between Dominic West and Lynn Collins' princess detracts our attention from the alien race. The green-skinned, 12-foot tall barbarians are full of character and back-story which is what the human lookalikes lack. Tars Tarkas (voiced by Willem Dafoe) and his band of misfits are Disney greats.There's nothing particularly wrong with this movie.

119,Chris_Pandolfi,Burroughs' Space Opera Comes to the Big Screen,7,9 March 2012,"Like all good space operas, ""John Carter"" relinquishes virtually all restraint on common sense and plunges headfirst into pure intergalactic melodrama. In spite of the obvious narrative anchors to reality – feuding tribes, political corruption, romance, advancements in technology – we're immersed in a world and a time that exists solely in the imagination. Yes, this is in part due to the film's 3D presentation (which is admittedly decent enough for my seal of approval), but mostly it's due to the care with which the artists and technicians designed and built the environments. In other words, the sets, the characters, the costumes, and most importantly the special effects are all appropriate and convincing, albeit with the kind of heightened reality one would expect from a Saturday matinée serial.The film is an adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""A Princess of Mars,"" which began in serialized form in 1912 and would ultimately be collected into the first of eleven books in 1917. Its journey to the big screen was surprisingly long, beginning when Burroughs was approached by Bob Clampett in 1931 for permission to turn the first book into an animated film. Burroughs agreed, and five years later his son teamed up with Clampett to create test footage via rotoscoping and other hand-drawn techniques. This footage failed to impress exhibitors and investors, and the project was abandoned. It would languish until the 1980s, when the rights were bought for Disney. It would remain in development hell before the rights were returned, then picked up by Paramount, returned once more, then finally picked up again by Disney in 2007, at which point Pixar veteran Andrew Stanton was hired as director. Like Brad Bird with ""Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol,"" ""John Carter"" marks Stanton's live-action debut.This winding road was surely a blessing in disguise, as it's hard to imagine this story being told without today's advancements in computer technology. This would include motion capture, a process I continue to champion in spite of persistent backlash. I also think contemporary audiences would better appreciate the clever narrative technique of making Burroughs a character in the film – in this case, John Carter's eighteen-year-old nephew (Daryl Sabara), who's eventually advised to settle down and, perhaps, write a book. If this movie had been made seventy-five years ago, as was originally intended, this wouldn't have worked at all. After all, the real Burroughs was still alive at the time. It would have seemed strange and perhaps even a bit self-congratulatory.The plot, while at times difficult to follow, falls well within operatic conventions and is appropriate. It begins in the late 1860s, at which point Virginia-born John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), a captain for the Confederate Army during the Civil War, has become apathetic and disillusioned. After finding a cave full of gold in the Southwestern desert and nearly being stabbed to death by a mysterious robed man who appeared out of nowhere, a strange metallic device somehow transports him to the habitable and populated planet Mars – or, as the locals call it, Barsoom. After learning how to navigate the planet's lower gravitational pull, he soon finds himself embroiled in a bitter feud between three clans, one that, if not settled, could spell certain doom for the entire planet.We first meet a race of tall, green-skinned, tusked, insectoid beings called Tharks – computer generated creatures animated from the movements of live actors. Their leader, Tars Tarkas (Willem Defoe), is a proud yet noble warrior, and he rescues Carter when the other Tharks are ready to tear him limb from limb. They initially speak a Martian language, but for simplicity's sake, Carter is made to drink a liquid that, somehow or another, gets him (and the audience) to understand what they're saying. Then there are two humanoid races, both covered in red tattoos, both engaging in deadly territorial disputes. There are the arrogant, manipulative Zodangans, led by the cocky Sab Than (Dominic West). Then there are the sensible citizens of the city of Helium, the Heliumites. Their leader, Tardos Mors (Ciarán Hinds), believes that the only way to achieve peace is for his daughter, Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins), to marry Mors.Carter initially refuses to take anyone's side. But then Dejah enters his life. Apart from being a fierce warrior, she's also a scientist who's on the verge of making a groundbreaking discovery, one that could ensure the survival of her people and the welfare of the planet. But if she's to succeed, she'll need Carter's help. He reluctantly agrees. At the same time, he must also help another Thark, the nurturing Sola (Samantha Morton), escape the wrath of the power-hungry Tal Hajus (Thomas Haden Church). Carter, Sola, and Dejah eventually travel by river to a sacred temple, where it's possible Carter will get the answers he has been looking for. But he must be cautious; a fourth race of mystical, self-serving beings called Therns, led by the manipulative shape-shifter Matai Shang (Mark Strong), is ever watchful of the situation.If you haven't been able to follow along, take comfort in the fact that the real purpose of ""John Carter"" is to be a crowd pleaser. There are plenty of decent action sequences (aided in no small part by the special effects and, to an extent, the 3D), and there are several amusing sidekicks, none more memorable than the Martian equivalent of a dog, which clings to Carter like a boy who found a best friend. The dialogue and the performances are perhaps a bit theatrical, but keep in mind that this is an archetypal serial fantasy, in which half of the fun comes not only from recognizing the familiar but also from witnessing the impossible. Knowing this, I'm admittedly baffled by the criticism that the film is derivative. By now, we should all know that certain stories are intended to be formulaic. Would we enjoy them any other way?-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",John Carter
120,jose-cruz53,A reasonably entertaining film,6,16 October 2012,"I found this film to be quite a failure if one takes into account its source material and the budget of the production: astonishing 250 million dollars, one of the most expensive films ever made and, indeed, one can have the pleasure to watch money burning in the screen when watching this film, given the detail of the special effects. This movie is worth looking pretty much thanks to the special effects, somewhat like Avatar.However, the plot and the characters lacked and as a result the overall experience was very underwhelming. I saw this film 6 months ago and I have no desire to see it again. It provided interesting entertainment for 2 hours but left a bitter taste in my mouth afterwards. Wanna an epic film set on a desert planet? Try Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, an 1984 Epic Masterpiece by Miyazaki, I consider it not only a great film but possibly the best films ever made.",John Carter

122,Ryan_MYeah,"Stanton puts an old fashioned stamp on it, but the movie is inconsistent in both pacing and writing.",6,16 May 2012,"John Carter, a feature film based on the tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs, has had a history worth reviewing all its own. Having spent numerous decades in development Hell, the project now comes full circle, but led from an unlikely source. Pixar director Andrew Stanton makes his first venture into live action film making, but unlike his animated efforts Finding Nemo and WALL·E, it doesn't turn out to be quite the masterpiece you'd hope.As far as visual artistry goes, everything couldn't be better. Boasting top notch sets and camera work, electrifying sound design, staggering visual effects, and a superb musical score (Michael Giacchino delightfully goes into full on Star Wars mode), it basically checks off every box. However, as beautiful as the eye candy may be, everything else feels somewhat hit or miss.The pacing of this movie feels inconsistent, but that's not as big of a problem as the movie's screenplay. Something about the the way the narrative cogs turned just stuck in my craw. Overwrought by an inconsistency of light plotting switching to heavy handed exposition, the movie begins to feel overly complicated, and yet strangely underwritten. The live action leads Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins don't exactly improve this, seeing as how their performances are rather flat.However, it's Andrew Stanton that really takes this movie by the reigns, and brings out the full excitement. An old fashioned, old school adventure flick through and through, Stanton stages his action sequences with epic panache, and takes undeniable glee in bringing the world of Barsoom to life. Largely thrilling, brimming with grandeur, and featuring a delightful supporting cast that includes Willem Dafoe, Samantha Morton, and Mark Strong (even though the latter feels typecast), no one could accuse Stanton of not knowing what he wanted the movie to be. I'd be quicker to lay blame on studio interference than I would him.If the script was only just as good, I'd be more enthusiastic. Still, as far as popcorn movies go, It's still fun, virtually harmless entertainment. I'll just call it a successful failure.*** / *****",John Carter
123,badajoz-1,A Long Wait and quite good!,6,22 March 2012,"I read the John Carter of Mars books when I was young teen - now I am a pensioner. So you can see how long I have been waiting for a film version! And the books were over 50 years old when I read them. The major problem is that they have been raided and robbed by almost every SciFi film maker in the history of the cinema, so a lot of the film is very familiar. And the writers of this movie have not done themselves any favours by robbing other modern CGI films to spice up an old fashioned action/love story - eg the jumping sequences (Carter as an Earthling is more able/stronger in the thinner atmosphere of Mars) which owe more to 'IronMan' than Burroughs' original! The basic premise of a US civil war cavalryman being transported to another (dying) world - Mars - where he finds a cause of right to fight for and a Princess to fall in love with is worked alongside a warring planet with exotic different races (of course, the women are not semi-naked as in the books - now you know why teen boys read them!). Unfortunately instead of sticking with the fairly simple plot of the original, this film has to invent god-like immortal baddies who keep interfering (Clash of the Titans etc) so that Carter cannot be all-conquering and other diversions which clog up the narrative.A pity for the direction, writing and acting are pretty tight and good. By the way, you get a repeat of Ciaran Hinds and James Purefoy reprising Caesar and Mark Antony, with Polly Walker (Attia) voicing a green CGI bitch! The desert backgrounds are sumptuous and the art and production design excellent. But it is a huge failure. But one critic said - In my mind 'John Carter' and 'Avatar' are the same, so why is one a huge success when the other is an abject failure? I do not know except that movie critics have turned up their noses because of their own intellectual (if they have any) bombast. A case of which CGI film will we rubbish - roll on Ridley and 'Prometheus', hammering or over praise? As I said, a pity we have to put up with a rerun of 'The Last Samurai' with the embittered cavalryman, 'Iron Man' CGI effects, and 'Independence Day' aliens who harvest planets - John Carter should have had the courage of its' convictions and origins. A good attempt.",John Carter
124,Jerghal,Sunday afternoon snack,7,9 August 2013,"Disney's marketing department almost killed this 250m$ film by animation director Andrew Stanton with their incompetence. It's based on the book by Edgar Rice Burroughs, has tons of computer animation and doesn't look too bad, but I didn't find the story overly interesting or original and the 'long jumps' Carter can make, look fake (the physics don't compute) and the green aliens look too much like creatures from Attack of the Clones. Taylor Kitch (who also played in 209 m$ flop 'Battleship') does an OK acting job (they dug him up from a TV series apparently), but the supporting cast (mostly Britisch actors) is luckily somewhat better. From a quarter billion dollar scifi flick you would expect it to be at least epic, but this film is nothing more than a Sunday afternoon snack, so don't feel bad if you missed in at the cinemas :)",John Carter
125,martinrobertson300482,Light years behind any other space opera,3,12 March 2012,"Apparently the books on which this is based were way ahead off their time, and influenced the likes off ""Flash Gordon"" and ""Star Wars."" Never being the biggest fan off either will probably mean my opinion on this doesn't matter. But I have to warn everyone, that if ""John Carter"" goes as far back as they say. It is way too late too make a movie out off it. As it is just your standard sci-fi movie idea by now.Being first written at a time where the idea of a man on Mars must off seemed ridiculous. Its bad that even by today's standards, after countless ""Star trek"" like franchises, this still seems totally stupid.John Carter is a Civil war solider somehow transported too Mars, where he encounters big tall green aliens. Like in anything you'll see on the Sci-fi channel these creatures have their own made up names for everything, including the planet their on. I mean, couldn't they just off refereed to it as Mars the whole time? That would off had me losing my patience with this dumb dumb movie a bit less. Overall some off what these beings say is way too much. The Part that really got me embarrassed though, was that the main place on Mars (where all the trouble is afoot) is called Helium! ... Helium? ... Seriously?  That stuff that makes your voice squeaky? They must say ""Helium"" like a million times. Maybe if you took a drink every-time they said ""Helium"" the film would become fun. Fair enough there are actually a handful off genuinely fun gags in the film, but even the main running joke in the flick really does start to wear thin by the half way mark.It may sound like I am nit-picking here but overall the film is just a giant bore! I'm sure reading about this world was probably amazing to some that got it in the early 1900's. But too me, here, in 2012, it just seemed like I kept looking at the time on my mobile phone to check how long was left.There are some impressive effects, sure. But most stuff that comes out these days has that. I personally, needed more from this. Not to mention the plot holes and the most unconvincing romance ever. Not things that would usually annoy me too much, but I was so bored by ""John Carter"" that I thought I'd just mention that these faults are in there too.",John Carter
126,Maleplatypus,Shallow but entertaining,5,3 June 2012,"This movie would not be worth anybody's time (except, maybe, for thecast who gets paid for the work) if it weren't for the story and the writer behind it. Here E.R. Burroughs shows us how to produce a genuine idea which would be later (literally) stolen by G. Lucas (mainly) and some other directors, collecting also the fame in the process. The movie itself is typical Disney: shallow, visually attractive and only extreme emotions (anger and laughter) shown here and there. We call it here ""mildly sweetened water"". It leaves too many things unexplained (where? why? who? how? etc.), making it ""excellent"" only for the simple minds. Too bad. They (not Disney, for God's sake!) could have made it far more rich in content, plot, acting and so on. Maybe in two or three (or more) sequels (the Star Wars principle). The cast is a pure overkill and waste of talents (except for the two main roles - John and Dejah - who are as good as it gets). The verdict: fun occasionally. Kids could love it. Not much more than that.",John Carter
127,Aly200,"Not great, but not too terrible",5,25 February 2017,"Sometimes Disney hits a stumbling block and their movie can take a massive blow. Back in 2012, adapting ""A Princess of Mars"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs and turning it into ""John Carter"" was one such problematic misstep in the company's history. While not the worst film ever released by the animation juggernaut, there are numerous flaws in an otherwise fun space romp.Problem number one is the casting of actor Taylor Kitsch as the title character, John Carter. While not an awful actor, Kitsch hasn't really proved he can helm a movie as its lead; ""Battleship"" coming out the same year and by far more lame than this outing, and he also had bombed as Gambit in 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". Granted Taylor tries his best to seem genuine as a former greedy prospector who transforms into Mars's savior, but the effort comes off as forced. The actor's costar chemistry is also bland and uninteresting and could have been much more believable. Another issue is where most of Disney's investment money went: the visuals. While the desert landscapes of the 1880s Old West and the vast reddish deserts of Mars is impressive and detailed, the film becomes an over-saturation of CGI effects that look a bit cheap and too obvious. Some of the set pieces are jaw-dropping like the spaceships and some of the buildings are constructed well, but it's a shame that the CGI takes center stage over storytelling.The movie's story is fairly straightforward as John Carter has to become a savior for the planet he is stuck on while he initially wants to get back to Earth, but then throw in the half-hearted romantic subplot with the royal princess it becomes a bit overblown. As already stated, the movie's visuals take center stage more so than the story not long into the movie's run-time. Characters are mostly left as caricatures of what could be exciting players with layers of personality while the story clunks along.Two saving graces for the film are in the prestige of its director, Andrew Stanton, and the film's two motion-capture performances from actors Willem Dafoe and Samantha Morton. Sadly the film is a massive waste of two talented actors (thankfully Dafoe and Morton aren't quite physically present) who could've been more fleshed-out. Willem Dafoe does do his best to make an impression with some form of an accent and attempting to insert his trademark strangeness, but having an underwritten character who is meant to be an alien warrior leader; the acting veteran does his best with the material he is given. Equally respected British talent, Samantha Morton, is also underutilized in her performance. Like Dafoe, Morton tries her best with the material she is given and attempts to give her character a personality on par with her skill. Morton does demonstrate a capable female alien warrior who can handle her own in conflict without needing help from the film's lead.While this was a huge flop for its director, Andrew Stanton's prestige within Disney was well earned after the massive success of ""Finding Nemo"" was a hype point for the company. Trying his best to deliver on a live-action extravaganza, Stanton does do a fairly valiant job at making use of the film's settings and trying to focus on the characters central to the scene. However it ended up being in vain and putting a splotch on the director's reputation, but hasn't killed his career. We can expect more valiant projects from this Oscar winning animation director. Hopefully the next live-action effort Andrew Stanton might attempt will succeed even more.",John Carter

The acting is satisfactory for an adventure movie and the direction is well done for the genre. The screenplay lacks a bit in some areas. There is very little from the original books (the towns, the character names, the races are there)that made them so enjoyable. You are missing the relationship between John Carter and Tars Tarkas that defines the storyline of the entire series. It is like not writing in the growing relationship between James Kirk and Mr. Spock. Of course Hollywood has to add a supernatural-type being instead of following the storyline. There is a weapon (not in the stories) that is invented, with a moving city and the goal to destroy the world. The Hollywood element takes away from the relationships between the four major players from the first book: Carter, Tars Tarkas, Sola, and Dejah Thoris. If the movie had more of the substance that the books had, it would have had the opportunity to cash in on more of the books so create a franchise. As it stands, the Hollywood element has basically made it look like it will be a one-shot deal. Decent movie--could have been better.",John Carter
130,ultramatt2000-1,Boffo from Barsoom!,10,10 March 2012,"In a world where movies are nothing but exploiting subjects like the war on terror, 9-11, the financial crisis, remakes, live-action adaptations of cartoons and TV shows plus having our intelligence insulted in a rather strong and nasty manner, there is nothing like a good movie that gets our mind off of the horrors and stresses of everyday life.Since 1912, Edgar Rice Burroughs's great stories about a man on Mars grasped the attention of Hollywood. In 1932, Robert Clampett wanted to make an animated adaptation of it, but it never happened. In 1958, after Colombia made mountains of cash with THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD, there was planning to make a live-action adaptation with Ray Harryhaussen's special effects. It never happened. In the 1960's Jim Danforth (a fan of Burrough's Mars stories),created test footage of the Martians fighting a Banth (a Martian lion-like creature). Sadly, no one was interested. In the 1980's Disney grasped the rights and had plans to adapt it starring Tom Cruise as John Carter battling stop-motion monsters by Lyle Conway (DARK CRYSTAL and the original CLASH OF THE TITANS). It never happened. All was calm until with the success of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and the HARRY POTTER franchise, it was time resurrect the project at Paramount. Kerry Conran took control of it, the gave the reigns to Jon Favreau (who would later play a Thark Bookie in the final version). Alas, CGI test footage was all that was left. Now it is Disney's turn and this time the completed it. Forget about The Asylum's adaptation from 2009. Like Mario said to Luigi in an animated College Humor skit about the live-action movie, ""It never happened!"" The story (what wonderfully weird words like ""Thark"", ""Barsoom"", ""Woola"" and ""Tars Tarkas""), creatures (which were different from the descriptions from the book, but I did not care), characters, special effects, music, camera work and sound effects are awesome! It is worth watching. It predated AVATAR, STARGATE, STAR WARS, SUPERMAN, FLASH GORDON and Ray Bardbury's THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES. So if you want to get away from it all, this movie is your ticket. I saw it, loved and highly recommend it. This movie is so good that it deserves a sequel. Please give it the sequels that it deserved.10 out of 10 stars.

Finding himself a prisoner of these creatures, he escapes, only to encounter a princess who is in desperate need of a savior.When I first heard about John Carter, I didn't know to think. The idea sounded new and inventive, but the trailers said otherwise. Disney spent millions for marketing, sadly marketing it as a cliché, recycled movie that has been done before. It consisted of action and dubstep music, which is nothing new nowadays. Nevertheless, I saw the movie with no expectations and was VERY surprised... Disney spent more than 300 million dollars for the movie and to market it. As said before, they marketed it quite wrong and very sadly released it whereas no one would want to see it. I, on the other hand, thought that this could mean something else. I have a hate/like relationship with Disney's movies but after seeing their work on movies such as Pirates, I thought they could at least do something different this time around... John Carter starts wonderfully. It mixes other genres and clashes them together for a enjoyable ride. John Carter starts off like a western film, turns into a science fiction, and turns into a action/adventure; all combined brilliantly. The cinematography was great, and the 250 million was spent well. The movie DOES tend to get to the kid's side, but the director did a great job turning away from this. Some scenes (like with the monster dog) were cringe-worthy, but thankfully soon after the film gives us something else. I hate how this film didn't do too well, because overall I thought it was a great money spent. It was new, inventive, and thankfully enjoyable for all ages... My favorite scenes were probably the ones on Earth, because we get to know more about the humans than the alien colonization. The sets were great, and the casting was pretty good too... Sometimes, the characters seem to get a little too carried away, and mostly with the main female lead. John Carter's actor seemed to be faking the whole raspy voice, and I had many other minor complaints, but nothing worth noting. So if your here to enjoy something NEW, I greatly recommend John Carter. Ignore the bad reviews, as none of them are credible, and sit back and enjoy a action-packing, STORY-DRIVEN, experience. P.S: DO NOT SEE THIS FILM IN 3D. I've only seen a couple movies in 3D, and they were all pretty enjoyable. But with John Carter (which was actually a post-conversation) they messed up everything. I literally had to take off my glasses every once and a while to give my eyes a break, and they overdid it. And I do know that 3D gives the film a darkness, but with John Carter I literally couldn't see much at all. Minus the minor flaws and the 3D, I recommend John Carter. 8/10.",John Carter
132,Chalice_Of_Evil,Becoming John Carter of Mars...,8,7 March 2012,"Not a movie about Noah Wyle's character from the show ER, but rather one based on a book I've never read titled A Princess of Mars. Originally going to be titled John Carter of Mars, the movie apparently dropped the 'of Mars' to ""make it more appealing to a broader audience"" and this film is supposed to be the origin story ""about a guy *becoming* John Carter of Mars"" - this probably explains why we finally get the originally-intended title of 'John Carter of Mars' at the very end.The man in question is John Carter from Virginia, ex-Civil War soldier who lost his family and is now gold prospecting. Proceedings are rather slow-going in the beginning of the film, although it's necessary set-up for what's to come. Things don't really get interesting until Carter's transported to Mars, which is known as Barsoom by the inhabitants there, who are 9 to 15 foot tall four-armed green aliens with tusks called Tharks. Thanks to the lower gravity of Mars, Carter has enhanced strength and can leap great distances. We even get a montage devoted to him discovering as much. Some Tharks discover him, the least hostile of which is one named Tars Tarkas (voiced by Willem Dafoe), who winds up thinking Carter's name is Virigina due to miscommunication. Subtitles are used up until Carter is eventually able to understand the Tharks and we hear them speaking in English. At one point he comes to the rescue of an alien dog named Woola, who is extremely loyal/fast and becomes his constant companion. Carter also finds an ally in Sola (Samantha Morton). Eventually he meets the Princess of Mars herself, Dejah Thoris, after having rescued her (it's what he does). And this is where the real story begins.As John Carter and Dejah Thoris, Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins reunite (after the rather ho-hum affair that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine). Kitsch fits the role of the long-haired hero well (although he is saddled with some rather dodgy dialogue at times). His reactions to the bizarre situations, customs, etc that he finds himself having to deal with are pretty good. He is well-paired with Lynn Collins, who manages to make Dejah actually very human (like when she's nervous about the presentation she's about to give when we first meet her in the city-state of Helium...though, oddly enough, nobody there speaks with funny high-pitched voices like you'd expect). She's certainly the prettiest thing on Mars, but she's also very smart, as well as able to handle herself in a fight. She's equal parts scientist and action heroine. Kitsch and Collins play off each other very well, sharing both humorous and touching moments between them. Also good is James Purefoy as Kantos Kan. Although it's not a big role, he manages to make the most of it and is easily likable, as well as amusing at times. Mark Strong, meanwhile, continues to be the go-to guy for playing a villain.The story is not exactly easy to follow if you aren't paying attention. There's a lot of names of things to keep track of, as well as some twists and turns here and there. The film feels like it kind of rushes things a bit towards the end, as it has to wrap up stuff. Given the running time, you wouldn't think things would need to be like this, but it seems the makers realised their movie was reaching the limit of its runtime and there was still some stuff left to address at the last minute.The effects on display are as dazzling as Dejah's blue eyes. The thought and effort that has gone into designing/creating the creatures, the ships, the costumes, etc is fully on display on the screen. The music helps too. While this movie might not be everyone's cup of tea, it does offer something a bit different in place of what could have been a rather paint-by-the-numbers affair. Yes, some parts are predictable, but there are also some parts that you might not expect. Don't let the trailers fool you, it's not just all mindless action. There is some actual real story going on here (provided, of course, that you can keep track of/follow it). Recommended for anyone who's looking for a slightly off-kilter sci-fi film.",John Carter
133,fung0,A Worthwhile Adaptation,9,23 May 2012,"Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""A Princess of Mars"" just about created the last 50 years of Hollywood blockbusters. Star Wars is SO ripped off of that book... and, of course, practically everything else is ripped off of Star Wars. So it's great that someone finally tackled the one and only original.And it's quite a good adaptation. I enjoyed seeing Burroughs' creations brought to life, and I enjoyed ""John Carter"" as a movie in its own right. It's not a great film... but it's just the sort of escapist adventure that Burroughs himself specialized in.The same sort, but not the same one. The movie takes liberties with the original material... and rightly so. ERB's original story would be creaky by today's standards, so there's no use being too faithful. But some of the departures are needless and poorly chosen.1. The first compromise is the title. ""A Princess of Mars"" is a great title. It tells you pretty much exactly what to expect: romance, adventure and a strange new world. ""John Carter"" is a lame title. It could refer to just about anything, from a hard-boiled detective story to a teen romance. It may seem like a small thing, but the title really did color audiences' reactions to the film. Yes, the original title would have seemed strange in today's culture, but that would have worked in its favor. The change of title was a weak decision, made by a committee.2. Another compromise is the way the film starts. The whole introductory segment with the airborne battle on Mars is not only pointless, it drastically weakens the story. ""John Carter"" is a tale of one man, who suddenly finds himself in an unimaginably strange environment. We should have discovered that environment as Carter does, and not had a sneak-peek ahead of time. This weakens our sense of identification with Burroughs' interplanetary Odysseus, and shifts the emphasis to the story, which was never ERB's strong suit. This was another decision made by a gutless committee. Someone in a meeting said: the intro is too slow, we'll lose the audience. They were dead wrong. To make great movies you have to take chances, build at the pace dictated by the material, and trust your audience to come along.3. The final, and most significant, compromise lay in attempting to modernize the story. I recently re-read the first several Mars books, for the first time in decades. They're surprisingly intimate, low-key affairs. There's a background of great events, but the real story takes place on a very human scale. There are conversations, confrontations. Meetings in darkened rooms. The action is there, but it's far from 'non-stop.'What's more, one of the real charms of ERB's Barsoom is that it represents the future as seen through the naive eyes of 1912. It really makes sense only when seen in that historical context. And it then acquires an extra nostalgic dimension, giving us an insight into the mind and imagination of that far-gone era. Modernizing the story homogenizes it, and makes it seem like a me-too creation. Going for more of a retro, steampunk look would have emphasized that this is THE granddaddy of all interplanetary adventures. (A more explanatory marketing campaign would have helped too. Epic FAIL, Disney.)Going for more of an old-fashioned feel would also have allowed the film to preserve some of ERB's marvelous literary quality. His plots may have been pure melodrama, but his language was amazingly poetic. Re-reading the Mars books, I found myself frequently pausing to marvel at a particular sentence, or a single phrase: words so perfectly chosen that they simply could not be improved upon. Some of that should have made it's way into the dialog of ""John Carter."" There's a marvelous exchange between Errol Flynn and an English judge at the beginning of the movie ""Captain Blood."" It sets up the sense of romance for the rest of the film. I'd have liked the air battle of ""John Carter"" to have been replaced with something like that.Fortunately, the film does capture many other elements of ERB's vision. The green Tharks, for one. They simply could not be better... they're absolutely true to the weird descriptions in the books, yet manage to rise above their CG limitations and live as characters.I also adored the choice of Lynn Collins to play Dejah Thoris. (Though, of course, she should have been wearing full red-skin makeup.) She's not exactly a powerhouse in the acting department, but she's got the perfect look; she's exactly the Princess of Mars that I wanted to see. I'd have loved to see her grow into the part through a long course of sequels...All in all, despite its limitations, ""John Carter"" is a fine adventure film, that does manage to convey at least some of the magic of Edgar Rice Burroughs' writing. It does require a stronger-than-usual suspension of disbelief, but I'd recommend it highly to fans of classic swashbucklers.",John Carter
134,rparham,John Carter is both familiar and boring,5,9 March 2012,"By various accounts, there have been attempts to bring Edgar Rice Burrough's second most well known character, planet hopping John Carter, to the screen as far back as the 1930s. However, it has taken until 2012, the centenary of the publication of A Princess of Mars, the first John Carter tale, for those efforts to finally bear fruit. Disney's John Carter is full of what you would expect from epic pulp science fiction: multi-limbed, green-skinned aliens, a square jawed hero and a beautiful woman for him to alternately save and fall in love with. The problem, however, is all these elements are in service to a seemingly endless slog through a pastiche of familiar components without a compelling reason to exist.The film opens with a fast as lightning narration that will possibly leave the uninitiated scratching their heads as the scene is set: on the planet of Mars, known as Barsoom to its indigenous inhabitants, the Zondangans are attempting to strip mine the planet of its resources (I think). Opposing them are the people of Helium, led by Tardos Mors (Ciaran Hinds), against the evil Zodangan leader, Sab Than (Dominic West). However, Sab has formed an alliance with a group of creatures that the people of Barsoom view as assistance to their great goddess, Isis, named Therns. The Therns, primarily represented by Matai Shang (Mark Strong), have given Sab a powerful weapon that he is using to subdue the people of Helium so that they can engage in a nefarious plot. Meanwhile, on Earth in the late 1800s, John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), a former Confederate soldier, is prospecting for Gold in the Arizona territory when he accidentally encounters a Thern in a cave and is teleported to Mars, where the difference in gravity and the density of his body gives him the ability to leap through the air as if the whole planet was a giant trampoline.Shortly after arriving on Mars, John is captured by Tharks, the previously mentioned aliens, whose leader, Tars Tarkas (the voice of Willem Dafoe and some decent computer animation for the visual appearance), takes a liking to Carter. Through various plot machinations, John ends up saving the Helium princess Deja Thoris (Lynn Collins) from the clutches of Sab, who desires to marry her so he can gain power on Mars. Deja convinces Carter she can get him back to Earth, but hopes to convince him to take up the cause against the Zondangans to save Mars.The John Carter of Mars series of books have long been favorites of authors and filmmakers who would shape science fiction throughout the 20th century, including such luminaries as Ray Bradbury and George Lucas. Over the years, elements of the John Carter stories have been cherry picked and utilized in so many other works that, now that the ""original"" material is finally being adapted, frankly, it manages to look derivative and old hat. I am aware of the historical significance of Burrough's work, so while I can reconcile the fact that John Carter feels like it is ripping off other films that actually ripped their elements off from the John Carter stories, it doesn't change the fact that this film is late to the party compared to so many others, and looks it. Many familiar elements to modern audiences are on display, such as a princess in danger, megalomaniacal villains who desire world domination, alien beings with strong, instilled senses of honor, so on and so forth. John Carter cannot help the fact it looks like it is robbing other, better films.Much of this could be forgiven if John Carter was a rousing tale, but alas, it is not. The film spends an interminable amount of time setting up its story, introducing characters who prove one-dimensional, and moving slowly through familiar paces, that it quickly wears out its welcome. John Carter also unveils its narrative in a rather haphazard manner, leading to an extensive learning curve for audience members who are not well versed in the stories on which the film is based. Once the narrative is going it doesn't prove impenetrable, but it also feels as if big chunks of explanation have ended up on the cutting room floor.Carter is given a tragic backstory, and at one point it does provide a degree of pathos to him, but aside from that, these are people we don't really care about. Carter and Deja are supposed to be smitten for one another, but there is no legitimate chemistry, just a screenplay mandated romance. The villains are rather limp as well, with Dominic West providing his best dastardly villain turn but proving somewhat cheesy and obvious, and Mark Strong plays his character with very little energy, not giving the audience someone to root against.Kitsch certainly looks the role as a hero, but the screenplay gives him little to do that endears John Carter to us. Lynn Collins, with reddened skin and tattoos, projects a degree of exotic beauty that makes her a good choice for Deja Thoris, and her character is endowed with a little more material to work with. Ciaran Hinds is here to look important and collect a paycheck, James Purefoy is here to provide an offbeat, playful guard to Deja and collect a paycheck and the most endearing character proves to be a computer generated, six legged, fast- as-The-Flash dog creature that you can't help but find cute.John Carter has an impressive filmmaking pedigree behind it, including director Andrew Stanton who previously helmed the Pixar films Finding Nemo and Wall-E, and award winning novelist Michael Chabon who is an admitted Burroughs fan. It is unfortunate that such talent serve up something so lackluster, but John Carter proves an underwhelming affair that will most likely have audience members shifting in their seats well before the running time is half over. Edgar Rice Burrough's character deserves better.",John Carter
135,Tcarts76,Good for Family movie night.,8,23 September 2012,"I give this one an 8. It's a pretty good action, sci-fi, fantasy film that the whole family can enjoy. Mommy gets eye candy in the form of John Carter ( Taylor Kitsch ). Dad can drool over the warrior Princess, Dejah ( Lynn Collins ). The kids will enjoy the four armed green martians. The action is pretty good. There is a good bit of G/PG comedy to keep you interested.I am a big proponent of using CGI minimally, and only using it when there are things that absolutely can't be done with real effects ( Let's face it diluting an entire movie with CGI killed the 3 newest episodes of Star Wars, and now I don't even like to admit those episodes are even part of the series). They did a little of that in this one, but because of the fun entertainment value of this movie, I didn't mind it.OK, So the storyline of this one is way out there and ridiculous, but this is one of the rare times that it actually works. Its a good fun ride that is enough to keep everyone interested, and there are none of those scenes that you have to tell the kids to look away, or any that you would feel awkward trying to explain. The acting is definitely over the top but that works in its favor as well.So the next time you have the family together and nothing to watch, pop some popcorn turn down the lights and put John Carter on the DVD player and have fun.",John Carter
136,manendra-lodhi,Lacked proper presentation I suppose.,6,18 June 2012,"The film is good to see for a change when you have seen a lot of drama. But still I could not help laughing at the silly things in the film. The concept is obviously good, but some things irritate even when you try a lot to like the film like too much of bluishness. I know there was much more in avatar but the handling of story in it is far better than this. The primary thing which has made the film terrible for some people is that we want to see action and the alien stuff but want to have a better handling of the story. Everyone liked avatar because the story builds slowly while keeping the interest of the people. Now in john carter I found that the director might be in a hurry. Or we can say the script was such that he had to put everything in the stipulated time. The most irritating thing in most of the films I consider is making the hero popular very quickly. John carter seemed to have a grasp of everything and adapted to the environment very easily which kind of seemed like unnatural and boring. So overall it could have been a good film if the characters would have been allowed to develop.""Watch only if you are a very big action fan.""",John Carter
137,Rabh17,"A Nice, Simple Visual Story of a old Pulp 'Classic'",8,22 June 2012,"A lot of people are dogging this movie because: ""It didn't match expectations.""Then there is the news that a Disney Exec lost his proverbial head over poor profits...as if THAT'S the reason we go to Movies?Please!Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote PULP FICTION. It was Fast Reading, Formulaic Fantasy for his time. In fact-- In ERB's time, he would have been called a 'Hack Writer'. He was not Hailed and feted by the New York Times. He was not considered for any Literary Prizes. He was offered no Literary Chairs at any University. It's only nowadays that because it's EARLY Sci-Fi, we attach the word 'CLASSIC' to it. And once we see the word 'Classic', expectations are then ramped up into the Stratosphere.But he was GOOD at what he did. I ate every book up in the early 60's. But EACH Book followed the SAME FORMULA.Earthman gets transported to strange world. Earthman gets embroiled in fight for Freedom. Earthman Wins Fight for Freedom. Earthman Gets beautiful Alien Princess.End Story. Start Next Story. Copy Basic Formula. Change Names. REPEAT.I liked the visuals. I like the secret society of immortals and the connected explanation for HOW John Carter got transported to Barsoom. The Radium Sky ships were beautifully done. And underneath it all, the sense of an ancient, deep though unstable civilization came across nicely. The Storyline was Simple-- and actually Disney-Safe -- and there are no moral 'Grey areas' in the Universe of Barsoom. And I was lightly entertained-- Nothing Heavy, nothing ugly, nothing twisted. Just Straight Up and Down adventure that's even Girl-Friend Friendly.That said, I DO give the grumblers a point if they had peeled off near $20 for the 3D. Or even the $15 for the 2D. The cost of Movies is getting so high that maybe THAT's the reason we're becoming hyper-critical. The Movie was nice and entertaining-- but NOT worth $20 tickets, plus sitting through 45 minutes of commercials and junk video and being robbed for overpriced concession food. Just Rent this one and enjoy in the comfort of your home.",John Carter
138,freaky_dave,Total disappointment,4,10 March 2012,"John Carter is looking as if it will be another overblown mess of a movie. The budget was outrageous and somebody at Disney will probably lose their job over this. The characters were all shallow with no real substance and for a movie that cost 250 million to make, I wonder where all the money went because the special effects weren't that great either.The story follows confederate soldier John Carter who finds a cave of gold and something else unexpected. It is a medallion which transports him from Earth to Mars where he faces off against many monstrous creatures and discovers a princess who's kingdom needs saving. Since he is from earth where gravity is stronger than that of Mars, he is able to leap very high and very far and is also endowed with superhuman strength which works on occasion, that being when it is only necessary for the plot.I could not get in to this story and I could not get into the characters. THis was a dull boring movie. It may not be the worse film I've ever seen, but I expect more from Disney. THis was worse than the last Pirates of The Carribbean movie, and that's saying something. Not recommended.",John Carter
139,JohnWelles,Ironically Unadventurous but Nevertheless Entertaining,6,17 September 2014,"""John Carter"", directed by Andrew Stanton, his first live action film after having previously made Pixar animations like ""Find Nemo"" (2003) and ""WALL-E"" (2008), found himself entrusted with a $250 million budget to adapt Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1917 pulp sci-fi novel ""A Princess of Mars"". The studio, Walt Disney, was certainly confident of Stanton despite his relative inexperience in actual directing on set. While from a financial point of view this conviction in him was misplaced, the film a heavy flop, making $160 million loss, which was only alleviated for Disney by their record-breaking ""The Avengers"" (2012), the movie itself, has a lot to recommend it. Stanton shows himself to be eminently capable, managing an even tonality from the abrupt shift of its post-American civil war prologue to the Martian terrain of the rest of the picture.He's aided by a script, written by Stanton, Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon, that approaches its century-old source material with a refreshing lack of irony or self-consciousness. In playing it entirely straight, Taylor Kitsch as the titular character brings a sense of a 1930s serial updated to the present day with the latest advances in the special effects. If that description makes it sound like ""Star Wars"" (1977), the similarity is far from accidental. Stanton has spoken of being inspired by George Lucas' space opera, and the old fashioned heroism, romance and feeling for adventure certainly aligns it in the same tradition. Originality is not the film's strong point, but nor is it meant to be; in a world of post-modern, self-referential blockbusters Stanton intends to craft a thrilling, retro sci-fi picture.The plentiful action scenes are well-handled, although perhaps not as memorable as they should be, and bolstered more by Michael Giacchino's stirring score than the editing rhythms of Eric Zumbrunnen. Superior is the Martian aesthetic, from the splendid landscape vistas (in reality a digitally enhanced Utah) to the design of the two races, the four-armed green Tharks and the elaborately costumed humans. The architecture of cities like Helium is accordingly impressive, rising out of the stark desert environment.The large cast, including Lynn Collins, William Dafoe, Dominic West, Mark Strong, Ciarán Hinds and Bryan Cranston, invest a lot in their roles, even if Strong is really only called upon to be evil towards everyone. Perhaps the idea that we've seen films like this before, if not put up on the screen with so much gusto, and the shortage of unforgettable moments prevent this from advancing further from being anything other than a very enjoyable family science fiction film.",John Carter

142,achyutaghosh,"Entertaining in parts, could have been so much better",6,8 March 2012,"The name Edgar Rice Burroughs usually calls out for a big ""Woooooohooooo""- Tarzan is his greatest creation, but the first character he ever created was John Carter, an earthling who has many adventures in Mars. Disney's reproduction of the first (of a possible franchise) John Carter movie is silly, over the top, and unintentionally funny in parts, but also has moments of audacity, some of the finest rendition of 3D-fied action set pieces, and a soul which will appeal to dedicated scifi/fantasy epic movie fans.Taylor Kitsch plays John Carter, an American Civil War veteran out to try out his luck in gold in the wild wild west. He is charming and courteous with the ladies, but can cause havoc if his ideals are challenged. One fine day, when on the run from the law, he chances upon an amulet which zooms him away to a version of the red planet called Barsoom- and here in Barsoom, Carter is special as the low gravity helps him to travel great distances through jumps, and sometimes, literally fly. Now since the source material is about 100 yrs old, Burrough's version of Martians include both humanoid aliens and four armed green creatures called Tharks. The Tharks choose to watch on as the two warring groups of humanoid aliens try to blow each others to smithereens. Is this a metaphor for the conflict in Carter's own world- the two warring sides being the protagonists in the American civil war, and the Tharks being the Indians? Anyways, John soon meets feisty princess Dejah Thoris, played by Lynn Collins, who is on the run from her tribe's oppressors, saves her a couple of times in Superman-ly fashion and predictably falls in love. The rest of the movie revolves around how our hero is able to end this bloody conflict that threatens to take inter-planetary proportions, and still get the girl. In the process he battles giant apes, unites warring tribes, successfully takes on godlike adversaries, and yet also takes out time to get a pet pooch for himself.It is always difficult to make a movie that mixes genres- this one takes a bit of western, a dash of Victorian England, and of course a generous dose of epic scifi fantasy to come out better than the other big budget mix genre dud of last year- Cowboys and Aliens. But by better i mean just a wee bit better- the first 30 minutes of the film is a drag, but the film begins to motor along once John reaches Barsoom and starts getting on with it. This is an exotic universe, the action sequences are splendid- there are superb aerial fight sequences, a massive, mobile tyrannical city, cavalry charges atop alien rhino-like creatures, swordfights galore, and of course the staple for scifi movies- green 4 handed aliens, and blue alien blood. Taylor Kitsch looks good in a physically taxing role- watch out for the scene where he discovers he can jump in Barsoom or when he singlehandedly slaughters an army of Tharks. But as an actor, he is mediocre, has no charisma, and luckily for him, the script doesn't let him talk much. He is unfortunately there in almost every frame, and a film that relies so much on the titular character really needed someone with infinitely more magnetism. Lynn Collins comes in again in a comic book adaptation after Wolverine, and is probably the only person who gets some substance in her role as the scientist-warrior-princess. There is a host of British acting talent such as Mark Strong, Dominic West, Ciaran Hinds and James Purefoy playing supporting roles with scarcely believable expressions. The costumes are a mix of ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian and it feels as if they have walked out straight from the series, Rome. While there are airships, cannons and guns, the bulk of the fighting still gets done by that surprisingly ineffective but perceived honourable weapon- the sword.Director Andrew Stanton has given us animated classics such as Wall-E, Toy Story, Up and Monsters Inc- each one characterized by wit, imagination, and emotional quotient. While the imagination is genuinely reflected in the CGI sequences, some more wit would have been a welcome addition, as would have been an attempt to pack an emotional wallop. Even then, John Carter never was an attempt at great film-making, nor was it aimed at memorability- it was made squarely to provide a weekend's worth of exhilarating popcorn entertainment, and the amusing world of Barsoom and its many colourful characters does ensure that John Carter does not waver far from its intended target. 6/10",John Carter
143,dmuel,30 years too late,5,27 March 2012,"John Carter is a romantic fantasy about a US Civil War vet who is mysteriously transported to Mars. There he meets an array of odd creatures, villains, humanoids with unworldly powers, and a hot babe. Some viewers have compared it to Star Wars and I can see what they mean, although this is based on an Edgar Rice Burroughs series that was written about 100 years ago. This movie has bombed. Disney is reported to have lost $200 mil on it, and I think there are three reasons for this. 1) Unfortunately, it's easy to think of Star Wars when viewing this movie; both are romantic adventures set on another planet, so the movie is about 30 years too late. 2)Taylor Kitsch was a horrible choice for the lead role. His performance falls flat as a pancake as the hero/protagonist; he's utterly unconvincing. And 3), this one is my personal reason: the movie has really bad music. And it never stops; from beginning to end, we only get about 10 minutes respite, (in nearly 3 hours of film), from this constant humming of violins, tooting of horns, and droning human voices ala the chorus from Holst's Neptune.

144,plasticanimalz,This Movie Was Awesome!,9,30 March 2012,"First of all, I would like to say to the head of live-action at Disney who tried to kill this film, and the marketing team, who worked on the majority of this film, which also failed miserably; you can both suck it. Anyone who actually sees this film knows, just like 'Iron Giant' that something was going on behind the scenes, to purposefully kill this project. The ball was dropped. This is one of the best science fiction films I've seen since the '70s or '80s. I loved the book. The movie looked amazing. The writing and storytelling was epic and flawless. The acting was fantastic. And why wouldn't it be, it was done by Pixar! You really have to wonder why none of those names were dropped while marketing this film. Oh, wait, no you don't, since Disney was purposefully trying to kill this film.'Avatar' was good, but, like 'Titanic,' it wasn't exactly a complex story. It was really paint-by-the-numbers and predictable. This was a good story, that followed the old sci-fi story telling of films like 'Star Wars,' where there is an actual plot, conflict, good versus evil, heroes with character, excitement, mystery, fantastic places, a conquest, emotional investment in the characters. It was a well-crafted piece of writing and an excellent adaptation from the book.There should be more films like this instead of the giant Michael Bay turds that keep being dished out.

The movie is well paced and all the effects and production design are done accordingly. The acting can differ, but then again that isn't the main feature in this film. There probably wasn't much missing in a movie such as this, as it delivers great action and an exciting enough story. For a more serious moviegoer though, the plot does tend to have some major problems, and hence why this movie failed a bit at the box office. For me it was easy to ignore this, as I was somewhat enthralled by what was happening on screen. I also think that much of this movie does seem to borrow elements from such movies as Avatar and Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time. Since I enjoyed those movies, there wasn't much to dislike about this one, even if it does underwhelm in some of the aspects the other movies perfected. John Carter seems very generic on the outside and while overly predictable, it doesn't bring anything innovative to the table. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for someone looking to watch a brilliant movie, this isn't what you're looking for. If, on the other hand, you do want to watch a fun movie and just watch it, then this is the film for you.Rating 7/10",John Carter

'John Carter' was meant to be a science fiction, action extravaganza produced by Disney that would dominate the summer box office of 2012 launching Taylor Kitsch into action hero superstardom and create a franchise that Disney could milk for years to come. That, unfortunately, is not what happened. Despite the Disney name front and center it could not stop the curse of Mars from dooming 'John Carter' to being one of the biggest box office flops of all time. For some reason people just do not want to see movies about Mars. There are some exceptions to that rule, but roughly that stereotype holds. This is directed by Andrew Stanton who is a mouse house guy through and through by way of Pixar. He directed 'Finding Nemo' and 'WALL-E' and participated in some creative capacity in just about every other Pixar movie to date. 2012 was meant to be the year of Taylor Kitsch. He had three high profile films come out, two of which could have led to large scale action franchises. When both failed at the box office he pretty much lost any leading man credibility he possessed and since has been resigned to supporting roles. This is a shame because this is really not a bad movie. It is not flawless by any stretch and I am not sure it merits its outlandish budget, but it is far from a throwaway piece of trash. I very much enjoyed this film and was sad when it underperformed squashing any potential talk of a sequel much less what was originally planned as a trilogy.'John Carter' is a character from the books of Edgar Rice Burroughs, famous for his Tarzan creation, and this film is adapted from a work from 1912. Debuting in 2012 it marked the 100th anniversary of the John Carter character in print. Burroughs is actually a character in this movie portrayed as the nephew of John Carter. The story commences being told in a flashback as Carter has seemingly died leaving everything to his beloved nephew. Carter's journal tells the story and commences in the post Civil War west as he is looking for a gold rush to make him rich. Instead he encounters a human appearing alien and inadvertently activates a medallion that takes him to an unfamiliar world: Barsoom, or as we on Earth know it, Mars. There he encounters two races of humanlike aliens at war and race of more monstrous like aliens that he falls in with to start. Being a human on Mars, similar to Superman, he realizes he has superhuman strength and abilities. He gets embroiled in the battle between the two races and amidst his quest to get back to Earth he finds love and a path to greatness on Barsoom.This is a decently fun movie with good action and a plot that is not too simplistic but also doesn't demand too much. Some of the special effects work really well and some seem decidedly lacking so chalk the visual effects up to a mixed bag. The cast surrounding Taylor Kitsch is very strong especially Lynn Collins as his love interest and Princess of Mars. Overall this is a bit silly and decadent and kind of a guilty pleasure but if you just go with it there is a lot of fun to be had here. Kitsch might have would up being a bit to broody to be an action hero leading man, but I thought he did a serviceable job and I've always enjoyed seeing him appear in movies. Stanton's direction in his live action debut wasn't stellar especially compared to his Pixar films but he did a more than passable job for an effects heavy first try. So while the team here ultimately did not hit a home run I think it winds up being a solid RBI double in what amounts to a fun, enjoyable, if somewhat hokey movie.Eric's Grade: B-",John Carter
148,C22Man,Entertaining but Struggles Under its own Weight,6,21 June 2016,"A film adaption of Edgar Rice Burroughs cult Barsoom series had been in the works for decades and it was Disney who finally got the chance to deliver it on the big screen. The films years of development hell and mammoth budget would be looming obstacles it needed to overcome in order to be a success. Based on the first book in the series, it follows the intergalactic adventures of haunted Civil War captain John Carter as he is transported to Mars (known as Barsoom) and plays a part in quashing civil unrest upon the planet. From that alone you can tell that this film is one where a strong suspension of disbelief is needed and in fairness the film makes full use of the imaginative possibilities as a result. From the outset it's clear that John Carter's biggest strength is its pulpy sensibility. It is certainly more Flash Gordon than Star Wars. It aims to be more quirky and amusing, and while it does have many cheesy moments but it is clearly having fun doing so. It understands that this story is larger than life and it frequently succeeds in making it pure entertainment. The issues come to the fore when it tries to balance out too much. It just feels weird when we keep jumping back and forth between images of Carter chopping up aliens in battle and him burying his dead family. I understand that the film wants to try to give the film an importance and intensity to certain parts, but it really struggles to balance those out with the more light-hearted pieces. Director Andrew Stanton, known for his Pixar work, knows how to make films engaging so it's sad he couldn't get that balance right. The action is undeniably spectacular and the many battles sequences certainly have the massive scope the film needs. The battles between the aircrafts and the frequent scuffles of the multi-limbed Tharks are shot excellently and carry a real sense of excitement. In fact the swordplay itself is very fluid and fun to watch throughout. The eventual climax does have a lot at stake and is appropriately grand, but it loses some of its edge due to its short length and because of how the films end unravels itself. The CGI is a mixed bag. The effects to create the Tharks and enormous cities are superb, yet there are a few occasions during the action sequences where things get a little ropey and the CGI is definitely noticeable. Michael Giacchino's score is a positive. He creates melodies that are both memorable and capture the sense of wonder that the film is aiming for. The cast is full of solid character actors. The likes of Willem Dafoe, Samantha Morton, Ciaran Hinds and Mark Strong all offer a weight to their characters even if they aren't that fleshed out. I was worried Taylor Kitsch wouldn't be able to hold the film up yet he does a fine job as Carter. He has the chiselled looks and body to go along with the intense demeanour. He is a little too serious at times, but I actually think he has great comic timing and that is utilised smartly throughout. Lynn Collins also does a good job as the princess, and eventual love interest, Dejah. Her subtle performance and delivery certainly gives a strong presence to her fiery character. The only performance that doesn't quite work is Dominic West as Sab Than, mainly because the character isn't fleshed out whatsoever rather than anything subpar from West.There is undeniable convolution in the plot and character motivations that harms the film. We never discover how the gateway to Mars came to be or how the atmosphere on the planet works or how Carter suddenly becomes the sole hope in defeating Than. We also never really know anything about the Therns (who are effectively Gods in this world) or what they are really trying to get out of their acts apart from creating some chaos. You could say the film deserves some leeway with these things, but I think it's reasonable to think that they should be explained. I think a slightly longer running time could have helped the film flesh out many of its underdeveloped or confused areas. The film's title also bugs me. I understand the change to give it more appeal, but I think it does the opposite. If you don't know the character then it sounds more like a biopic or a political movie. John Carter of Mars has a much more suitable feel and sound to it.When it's all said and done, I actually think John Carter just about manages to be a good film. When it doesn't take itself too serious and lets the pure excitement wash over then it is a great deal of fun. Technically the film is very impressive and the cast all do fine job. When it tries to make more sense of its overblown storyline and give a serious take on the plot, it is here that it fails. The plot and characterisations frequently get too convoluted and that does drag the film down somewhat. Sadly the film tanked at the Box Office, which is a great shame because I think the film had big potential for a franchise (certainly more so than films that end up getting one) and that more stories could be told involving these characters.",John Carter
149,quinnox-1,CGI Overload,3,11 March 2012,"I was really looking forward to this movie, I'm a huge science fiction fan, but it ended up being a non-stop CGI borefest with a high cheese factor and seems like it was intended for kids, not adults. I guess the Disney studio should have been a tip-off. The main hero is not interesting at all, non-charismatic, don't know where they got this guy from, but he was a total void in the role. The other actors don't fare much better, the limited number of human actors I should say, because a large percentage of the time the movie is featuring aliens who look like pseudo-lizards with terrible CGI effects that make them appear almost like a cartoon. If you loved Jar Jar Binks from the awful Star Wars prequels then you should love these deeply silly and dumb looking CGI dino-aliens.The story is an incoherent mess, and not even interesting enough to want to attempt to follow the plot. Action scenes are blah as well, with excessive and fake looking CGI again taking over. I can't recommend this movie unless you are taking pre-teen kids to it, they might like it, but anyone else steer clear.",John Carter
150,adrongardner,We was robbed,7,6 June 2012,"Flash Gordon.That's right, I said it. For all the modern fascination with special effects, BLUE aliens, metal suits, flying fortresses and capes, my memories drift back to a childhood high cheese favorite named Flash Gordon. See, in Flash Gordon, this human guy got mixed up in some bad alien juju at the hands of a bald bad guy. Flying, fighting and high hokum of the Saturday night matinée ensue. This is precisely what John Carter is. In fact, John Carter has easily out Flash Gordon'd every single Star Wars prequel because George Lucas's pointless toy commercial epics never had the entertainment or fun factor Andrew Stanton's epic has here.What is wrong with people?How John Carter has been hated on is beyond me. Wait, I get it, Avatar's aliens are blue not green! Wait, the Avengers has a bigger flying fortress! Captain America, oh that's right, has a BLUE suit! We was robbed, because John Carter is a total sendup of the old style Disney nonsense adventures like Mary Poppins, Way Down Cellar and the original Escape to Witch Mountain.So let's get this straight, people will pay to see Loki stand around in those ridiculous plastic gold horns for two hours but not this? What about the dog? John Carter has that hilarious butt kicking dog!At least see it for the dog. Did I mention the dog?",John Carter
151,WatchedAllMovies,reminds me of star wars,7,30 June 2012,"This movie reminds me of star wars -- different races of aliens fighting each other, and a princess who needs to be rescued.It's a pretty interesting movie to watch. There is very little boring moment, and I didn't have to fast forward the movie at all.The effects are better than star wars, of course, with one exception: the mars gravity effect is terrible. Even though mars has much lower gravity than earth, there is no visible effect, except that a person from earth can jump very high. But he doesn't look like he jumps high because of low gravity; instead, it looks like he's being pulled into the air.My main pet peeve is the princess is not ""princess pretty"" and looks older than the hero. There are lots of young and pretty actresses starving for a job, and the casting director could not find one?Mars' atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide. How can a human breath and survive? Also, how could aliens with no nose talk? Don't they need air to make sound?Overall it's a pretty interesting movie. I just wish they show the implied ending. Or maybe it's saved for the sequel.",John Carter
152,julian-mumford,A boys own romp with an uneasy combination of the Wild West and Sci-Fi,5,27 July 2012,"As a film Director, if your financial backer writes off almost the entire $250 Million production costs as your film opens, you know that you are in big trouble.Andrew Stanton of Pixar fame, in his first ""live"" action film, suffered this ignominious fate as his awkwardly titled summer blockbuster ""John Carter"" opened at theatre's. Like ""Waterworld"", this film has proved a suitable whipping boy for critics and the public alike, ""Biggest Bomb ever"" is perhaps one of the kindest taglines.So after all the dust has settled is the film any good? Like so many Box Office turkeys, not as bad as you might have been led to believe but...Following a prologue which confuses rather than excites, we arrive upon John Carter in Virginia 1868 (Taylor Kitsch). Carter is a decorated retired confederate soldier looking for gold, although a Cavalry captain is keen to enlist him, to go kill some Apaches.Finally hiding in a cave after many unsuccessful attempts at escape, he encounters a strange be-robed character clutching a medallion, who then promptly attacks him. Quicker than you can repeat a meaningless incantation, he finds himself teleported somewhere strange, very strange indeed.Within a few minutes, Carter is bounding around his new environment like a teenager with springs on his feet and Red Bull in his belly. The sequence is well done but does make the character look rather silly. Stumbling on some hatching alien eggs, as you do, Carter meets Tars Tarkas a green alien from the Thark tribe. Eventually they decide to adopt him as a pseudo baby, rather than BBQ the new find.Carter eventually discovers he is now on Mars, amidst a civil war between two warring humanoid factions. Luckily, they have audience friendly colour coded Red and Blue uniforms. He also gains a large alien dog like CGI creature, who follows him everywhere at a scamper, like a large slavering puppy dog.There is a love interest in the shapely form of Deja Thoris (Lynn Collins), a bargaining chip that refuses to be used as a pawn in the matchmaking between the two powers. A omnipotent group called the Thern, headed by Matai Shang (Mark Strong), appear to pull all the levers in this Universe, with all the combatants seemingly mere play things for their amusement.Confused, well you should be. The plot is cheesy, albeit based on original stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs, ""A Princess of Mars"" from 1917.Kitsch and Collins do well in the circumstances, in fact most of the human cast do not disgrace themselves. The effects are state of the art and it is clear where at least part of the budget has been spent. The aliens among others, are voiced by Willem Defoe, Samantha Morton and Thomas Hayden Church, their voice acting as you would expect, is good.So despite all of the positives, the film refuses to coalesce into a satisfying whole. Like building a Mini with parts from a Rolls Royce, there is quality but it still doesn't look and feel quite right. You watch certain scenes just contemplating, how did they get this far into the production without somebody asking, ""is this really working?"".The story commences like ""Cowboys and Aliens"" in the Wild West. The Sci-Fi section, which comprises the main part of the film, is a curious amalgam of all the worst CGI characters from New Star Wars, mashed together with the outtakes from Avatar. Clearly this has been done before and better, despite the origin story pre-dating the other referenced films.The film is destined to become a study in a Film history course, which is an unfair fate. Perhaps housed at Disney and without the famous Pixar brain trust, the Director's eye was taken off the ball, allowing the story to no longer be treated as King.Summary A boys own romp with an uneasy combination of the Wild West and Sci-Fi. The film stumbles fatally on occasions, exposing flaws that even better scenes cannot hide.Not entirely without merit but overall a disappointment. Watching forty minutes each of Avatar, Star Wars and Cowboys and Aliens, might be a better choice.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",John Carter
153,cnycitylady,Not that bad,7,19 February 2013,"John Carter is considered the biggest flop of 2012, but I don't know why that is. If you are going by the books (all ten of you who've read them), then yes, this movie is on a whole other sphere, but if you are the other seven billion people out there who have never heard of the ""Princess of Mars"" series then this movie has a good story, likable characters and great animation.John Carter of Mars is about a confederate soldier who happens, through some unforeseeable circumstance, to be transported to Mars. While there he comes across myriad characters who either take to him or repulse him, and he finds himself in the midst of a Civil War on this planet as well. The plot sounds fairly stupid I'll allow, but the script and story are executed to perfection. They leave no ounce of mystery and they give you just the right amount of action to keep your attention.The acting isn't the best I've seen. In some places it's spotty and overdone, really just adding to the stupidity of the movie but it's not so bad that you cannot get into the movie. In fact in some parts you are cheering along with the characters for their beliefs and for the epic battles taking place. (Yes, I said epic) You really get into the martian culture, and watching John Carter leap the surface of the martian earth is pretty cool.The animation, needless to say, is supremely boss. I believe they use that James Cameron technology, and more effective it has never been. You cannot tell, by voice or figure, who is playing whom. Both Willem Dafoe and Thomas Haden Church assume the identity of a green martian, one who aids Carter on his trials, the other who hinders his attempts. This movie is good family fun. Yes sometime in the middle it gets a little slow, but the last forty minutes or so really pull you back in. Take a look at this movie, there's so much more to it than meets the eye.",John Carter
154,The_Dead_See,Absolutely did not deserve to be the flop it was,7,16 May 2013,"It's maddening to me that messy, bloated, overblown movies like ""Pirates: On Stranger Tides"" or ""The Dark Knight Rises"" can be box office hits while films like ""John Carter"" fall so flat. I'm not sure if it's just a sad commentary on the current state of popular taste or if it's down to bad marketing or something else. Maybe it was the blandness of the title, or that Kitsch in't particularly compelling as a lead protagonist, or that the trailers looked suspiciously like they were using the Jar Jar Binks CGI engines from the appalling star wars prequels.Regardless of what caused it, John Carter absolutely did not deserve to be the flop it was.It's not perfect by any means: it's over-reliant on cgi, a tad confusing in spots, and probably too violent for its target age group (young teens imo)... but looking past those things it's a sci fi epic on a grand scale, neatly bookended with a clever plot twist set in the Victorian era, and with enough action, humor and sexiness to make it worth a couple hours of anyones' time.What makes the film so much fun is that it's got a good deal of the quick, knowing humor that makes a lot of animated features like Shrek or The Incredibles such a delight: There's Carter's unceasing comical attempts to escape in the opening act, an alien 'puppy' that's as amusing as it is adorable due to being able to move at lightning speed, and a 'buddy movie' relationship developed between the leader of the alien tribe and Carter. It was one of those movies where I constantly kept catching myself grinning and thinking ""I shouldn't be enjoying this, but I am.""I wish it had been more of a success because I would have loved to have seen some of the other Burroughs' works converted to screen with as loving a hand as this.",John Carter
155,tbmforclasstsar,"visually appealing, but an incredibly messy and lackluster journey on the red planet",4,9 March 2012,"It looks like Andrew Stanton should stick to animated films. The director of ""WALL-E"" (my favorite animated film of all-time), ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""A Bug's Life"" attempted to do what Brad Bird did so brilliantly a few months ago with ""Mission: Impossible- Ghost Protocol."" Stanton tried to make a live-action, blockbuster film after years of working with animation, but (unlike Bird) he fell flat on his face.Stanton, a two time Academy Award winner, is the director behind the new film ""John Carter."" Telling the story of a Virginian in the Civil War 1800s that is transported to Mars where he has incredible fighting, jumping, and agility abilities, ""John Carter"" is a messy tale that is somewhat enjoyable on the eyes, but boring and lackluster to the brain.The film begins with our hero attempting to escape imprisonment and attempting to find great wealth in the discovery of gold. But in his escape attempt, he comes across a strange medallion that transports him across space to the planet of Mars. After landing on the planet, Carter is confused by his strong abilities and the strange creatures that inhabit the planet, known as the Thark. The Thark are a green alien tribe that live in the mountain areas of Mars, away from the human kingdoms, known as the Helium and the Zodanga. Try to keep with me here I know these names are crazy.So John is captured by the Thark, but he escapes and manages to rescue the Helium princess Dejah Thoris. Eventually, the two ban together in their journey away from the Thark, but trust is not easy to come by for John. He struggles with understanding how he got to Mars, who Dejah is, and why everyone is fighting on the planet. Eventually, (surprise surprise) John falls in love with Dejah and he attempts to band the Thark alongside with him to defend Dejah and the Helium against the Zodanga and a man named Matai Shang, a shape-shifting being known as a Thern.OK, so we got all of that crazy lingo out of the way let's break this thing down. First off, the action of ""John Carter"" and the visuals are, admittedly, pretty entertaining to watch. While they are not pushing the world of visual effects in any way and do not contain anything we haven't seen similarly before, they are fun. This is a major credit to the film, but, unfortunately, one of the only decent parts of it.One of the biggest bores throughout the film is the world of Mars. Now, don't get me wrong, there isn't necessarily a ton you can do to make the Red Planet less red. But almost every scene takes place in a desert landscape that simply has a few cliffs here and there and a bunch of sand. After a while, the landscapes are extremely boring to look at. Even the arena is just a coliseum-esque desert bowl. Think of the battle arena Anakin and Padame fight in during ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones."" This is basically a replica.One of the other major issues with the film is the audience that is intended to see it. The film is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action, and that rating is more than fair. There is enough blood, fighting, and killing in the film that it is not meant for an eight year-old necessarily. However, the structure of the story and the absolutely cheesy style of telling it are not meant for anyone above 15 either. Stanton and his co-writers Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon have placed in numerous sequences and characters that are used for childlike comic relief. The alien dog-like creature, the dorky handshake between John and Dejah, the opening imprisonment where John continuously tries to escape while being talked to, and several other moments are meant for an audience much younger than who will likely see this film. Perhaps the style of fun for the whole family works with an animated film like ""WALL-E,"" but in an action-packed, other-worldly adventure, we don't need all that cheese.All of this is surrounded by the fact that Walt Disney Pictures had to pay a reported $250 million budget on this film, not to mention the millions they have no doubt spent trying to promote this thing. In all likelihood, Disney is going to take a huge hit on this one. I would venture to guess that they will not see half of that money back. And while I did mention the action was pretty fun, it is stunning that this was all that was produced on that $250 million budget. While there are some slightly recognizable names and faces, there was no actor on board with this film that could have taken a big chunk of that budget and also no one that has the star power to draw more audience members into the theater (and after seeing the film, no real reason to want to see many of these actors again either). Without any extraordinary advances in visuals or settings, I wonder where that $250 million went.With some boring acting, lacking landscapes, awful story adaptation, and childlike goofs placed throughout the film, ""John Carter"" cannot be saved even with some entertaining fighting scenes and visuals. The film is a complicated and messy product of what looks to be a director that doesn't know how to do live-action films. Don't get me wrong; I love Andrew Stanton's animated features. But the same cannot be said for his live-action work, and it could result in a long period of time before he gets a crack at one again. Stanton stood up to the plate, took a big hack, and missed terribly. Unfortunately, in this game, strike one might mean you're out for the Oscar winning writer/director.For more reviews, check out CustodianFilmCritic.com",John Carter
156,jonnyfendi,Conan the Barbarian Meets Avatar With Star Wars's Background,8,24 April 2012,"To be honest, I really didn't anticipate thiz movie until about three months ago, the trailer came out and had shown a whole new world of upcoming adventure. ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982) meets ""Avatar"" (2009) with ""Star Wars"" (1977-2005) background. Wow! And apparently thiz movie has filled the great expectations. His name is Virginia Errr, I mean John Carter! John Carter (Taylor Kitsch ) is a most wanted soldier in Civil War era who has found himself being transported to planet Mars in which he suddenly emerges in the midst of battle between the two warring clans and later falls in love with Princess of Helium, Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). It's exactly 100 years after the novel was first published, ""John Carter of Mars"" has finally brought up to the silver screen. The novel was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs who is best known for his original creation of the jungle hero Tarzan. For the first half hour, the movie tells how John Carter settles his conflicts on earth. But after that, how he finds himself waking up in Barsoom (or better known as Mars), where he can jump so high and exciting adventure is awaiting ahead. The two hours duration has gone pretty quick when you are glued since the first scene. The storyline flows confidently without any obstacles. I think it's more because of thiz movie is directed by Andrew Stanton who has a bunch of experience as a screenwriter. Andrew Stanton is also known as one of the fathers of animation studio Pixar. In fact, thiz movie is his first live-action directing after ""Finding Nemo"" (2003) and ""WALL-E"" (2008). I don't know what is really going on here, but recently some of those Pixar's Directors have been come out to do the live action movies. Just like last year, Stanton's colleague Brad Bird had directed Tom Cruise's ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2011). There's kind of excitement by watching thiz adventure in which we don't know where the story will lead us. Taylor Kitsch is a perfect choice for John Carter. He has some kind of aura and charisma to represent thiz hero figure. Thiz movie definitely will be a crucial stepping stone for Kitsch. Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris can do both, she can be elegant like a lady and next she can be tough like a warrior. The 12-foot-tall creatures are voiced by many famous Actors such as Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church and Mark Strong. I heard that thiz saga has thirteen books in total. Thiz means there is a possibility thiz adventure will be extended again. In that case, I can be sure that I'll be there when JC saves the mars again!

157,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: A Barsoom vacation.,7,11 March 2012,"As always a good idea will be taken and replayed again and again especially when it comes to a hot commodity like a popular feature film, in the case of John Carter it seemed to take a huge chunk from Avatar. The problem is that once a film like Avatar comes and goes it takes the originality with it, and as such some of the appeal from the newness. This was another Cowboys and Indians on a different planet story although the indigenous none human life form is pale green rather than bright blue and in the middle of a red dessert instead of an iridescent forest, there were just too many similarities to dispel. Not that the similarities are a bad thing, the special effects were first rate and the story was solid. Initially, I was completely perplexed as to what the heck was going on because the first 30 minutes jumped from scene to scene as much as John (Taylor Kitsch) did once he reached Barsoom. The burning question that I had from the moment that I saw the first trailer was, how the heck did John Carter get to Mars? And I must say that I was thoroughly pleased with the answer to that question. This film had good action when it was in action, there were moments that I felt were too talky and all the talk was serving no purpose other than to slow down the pace. The opening narrative explained enough to know what was going on with the inhabitants of Barsoom and the unfolding story details the events that brought John to this point in his life. The Integration of Edgar Rice Burroughs into the story as a crucial character was a nice way to pay homage to such a literary wizard. I'm glad I ignored the critics who did not appreciate this film and checked it out for myself. I was pleased with the acting which was very solid from Dejah Thoris (Lilly Collins), and Dominic West (Sab Than) tends to make a very good villain. I laughed at the 'Virginia' misunderstanding, I laughed at the attentive babysitter and I was annoyed with the constant crying of the hatchlings. Although the borrowing did not end with Avatar, since I've seen the Hulk use the hyper powered jumping as his primary source of transportation too, I was still thoroughly entertained. Had it not been for the slow talky moments this would have gotten a green light, but alas amber light it is.",John Carter
158,80sHorror,This was a dull boring movie!!,1,14 March 2012,"John Carter is looking as if it will be another overblown mess of a movie. The budget was outrageous and somebody at Disney will probably lose their job over this. The characters were all shallow with no real substance and for a movie that cost 250 million to make, I wonder where all the money went because the special effects weren't that great either.The story follows confederate soldier John Carter who finds a cave of gold and something else unexpected. It is a medallion which transports him from Earth to Mars where he faces off against many monstrous creatures and discovers a princess who's kingdom needs saving. Since he is from earth where gravity is stronger than that of Mars, he is able to leap very high and very far and is also endowed with superhuman strength which works on occasion, that being when it is only necessary for the plot.I could not get in to this story and I could not get into the characters. THis was a dull boring movie. It may not be the worse film I've ever seen, but I expect more from Disney. THis was worse than the last Pirates of The Carribbean movie, and that's saying something.

159,ksj870,John Carter's Adventures on Mars,9,5 July 2012,"Based on the writings of Edgar Rice Burroughs—who is actually a character in this adaptation of his work—John Carter is a fun-filled science fiction extravaganza. The plot is derived primarily from Burroughs' novel A Princess of Mars, originally published a century ago, but the movie stands on its own and newcomers to the story shouldn't have any trouble getting into the flow of things.And what a story it is! As the movie opens, John Carter (played by Taylor Kitsch, who captures the nature of the character perfectly), is introduced to us as a surly, disillusioned veteran of the Civil War, whose one remaining goal in life is to find a legendary gold mine somewhere in the Arizona desert. Whether by coincidence or destiny, Carter does indeed stumble upon his mother lode, which also happens to be a gateway to another world: Mars, or as the native Martians refer to their home world, Barsoom.And Barsoom is full of surprises. The change in gravity allows Carter to perform amazing feats of strength and agility. This draws the attention of the Tharks, a race of giant green men who capture Carter and from whom the confused Earthman slowly learns the basics of life on Barsoom. Eventually Carter discovers other humans on his new planet, embodied in the supremely beautiful Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins), Princess of the great city of Helium, bastion of civilization and learning upon Barsoom. But Helium is besieged by the army of Sab Than (Dominic West), a ruthless warlord who aspires not only to rule all of Barsoom but to make Dejah Thoris his bride. Before long Carter finds himself caught up in the war despite the fact that all he really wants to do is return to Earth to cash in on the gold he finally found. But will the lovely Dejah Thoris, and the righteous cause of her people, inspire Carter to rediscover the goodness within himself, and to become the hero Destiny wants him to be? It's an epic plot, and one that is superbly realized on the big screen. The world of Barsoom is a marvelous visual wonder, and the strange beings who inhabit it are brought to a magical semblance of life. The special effects showcase the wonders of alien technology in spectacular fashion, and director Andrew Stanton deftly maneuvers all the players and pieces within the drama to keep the action flowing smoothly along. The script does get a bit overly ambitious at times, and occasionally it seems that the movie is literally overflowing with ideas and subplots that perhaps might have been better saved for a sequel. But the film's energy and charisma are irresistible, and the overall result is one of the most fun pictures 2012 is likely to give us. A classic of science fiction brilliantly executed, John Carter is a great film the entire family will enjoy.",John Carter
160,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: JOHN CARTER (2012) Review,5,13 April 2012,"A century ago, famed American pulp fiction author Edgar Rice Burroughs penned the Barsoom series. His extensive vision in the series has inspired many sci-fi filmmakers including Flash Gordon series, George Lucas's STAR WARS, James Cameron's AVATAR, and countless others. And now the long-awaited, big-screen adaptation of the Barsoom series is finally arrived. Judging by the outlook of the sci-fi epic titled as JOHN CARTER, this project is simply a can't-miss cinematic experience. It was directed by Andrew Stanton, responsible for some of the most beloved Pixar's animated features ever made including 1998's A BUG'S LIFE, 2003's FINDING NEMO and 2008's WALL-E. As a matter of fact, he also had a hand in the script alongside with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon, who was responsible for the screenplay of 2004's SPIDER-MAN 2. Blessed with a lavish budget of $250 million, it's natural that many will predict JOHN CARTER is set to be one of the most successful sci-fi epics ever made.

This one was just awful. The storyline itself is interesting for the first 15 minutes when we get introduced to Carter and how he gets to Mars. From then on, there is virtually no coherent plot and the story just jumps around. The worst part are the battle scenes, there is never any true danger or tension in these scenes. The CGI ruins it all, things just slamming around and jumbled all over the screen, you can't really follow the action, just a bunch of computer images moving on screen. You never sense that Carter is in any true danger at any point. This movies represents the worst of the summer blockbuster, with too much put into it.

Obviously the filmmakers consider this a love story, so if you are a guy you'll be falling in love with the beautiful woman, and if you're a woman you'll fall in love with the hunky guy. It's a reasonable date night film if you both are interested in science fiction to some degree, although be prepared for the laws of physics to be trampled.There were some really interesting concepts brought to life in the world this film built, but unfortunately they were largely ignored. I suppose some was being saved the for sequels that got cancelled?Specifically, the lead actress, Lynn Collins, while she started out as the cliche'd perfect woman with brains/beauty/brawn, I was ultimately disappointed. I had hoped she would be involved more with the technical aspects of the story, helping us to understand the science fiction we really want to know more about. But we only get tiny snippets and then she's back to being a damsel in distress.Not that I'm particularly complaining, as Lynn Collins is equally ridiculously hot and 100% believable.

I cannot remember the last I've seen an American Hollywood blockbuster where i actually cared for the characters in a story. OK, Lord of the Rings, but that does not count , because it was mainly a new Zealand epic.I have to admit i was expecting the worse for John Carter. Specially when i saw the trailers which focus more on the action and effects, and so i was totally convinced this was going to be another Cgi effects show off and Hollywood had ruined the original novel by transforming it into another Michael Bay style movie or something like that, as usual nowadays with all the plastic boring popcorn stuff that's created to fill shopping centers movie theaters for a week and thats it. Boy, was i wrong !I cannot recall the last time i wanted to go buy another ticket and go right in to see once again a movie i just did finishing watching, but it happened with this one, and nobody is more surprised than i am. As a big fan of the original Burroughs novels, i was dreading the day when Hollywood would chop them off into digital meaningless pooh. Not here folks !OK, its not exactly the best book adaptation ever, but nevertheless is a bit like in Blade Runner. John Carter the movie might not be the most faithful book translation, but nevertheless it's still John Carter the novel in a strange fascinating way. And, in a lot of aspects it really is a lot better than the book ! How weird is this ?! When the book was written about a century or so ago, it really was ahead of its time, but now after all these movie and television decades , all that was invented on the original novels , everybody has seen it thousands of times in movies and TV. That, i thought it would be the death of this John Carter movie project because generations of movie goers already seen all there is inside these Bourroughs books , as ... ""Star Wars"", ""Dune"", ""Avatar"" , etc, etc,etcEverything that now seems like a cliché in John Carter, its pure illusion, as the original novels were the ones that developed the concepts in the first place. Nevertheless, because of this , and because of the action filled trailers, i was not expecting to be as good as it is. And its good, because its a blockbuster with a soul which bases all his strenght not only in the visual look, but above all in its characters ! In fact, the visuals are exciting because we really care for whats happening with the characters in the first place. John Carter of Mars delivered the kind of fantasy movie experience I first thought i would see in the new Star Wars trilogy. There's more soul, imagination and wonderment in ten minutes in John Carter than in ten hours of Sw episodes, one,two and three. Hollywood take notes. This is how you do it ! Keep doing it.I absolutely loved the characters in this movie. Even the secondary characters are well defined and everything works to depict a fascinating martian world that does not depend on Cgi over the top video game stuff to be a great adventure sci-fi fantasy movie. The humor is well inserted, not over the top one liners and the dog is simply brilliant, by the way. ;)John Carter compensates for the (now) lack of story originality, with details and texture. It does an incredible work with that, adding things that weren't exactly in the novel. This is a movie about details , not about special effects. Although the effects are amazing, its the usual well crafted art we are accustomed to see, because, surprise, surprise , the effects are really here to illustrate the story and not just to look cool !! I was not expecting this at all. The real magic here is in the details that give life to the martian world and characters. From the tribal alien characterizations into the way the plot is weaved to connect the characters , everything is perfect in my opinion. And believe me, I'm so sick and tired of Hollywood plastic blockbusters you wouldn't believe it. Nevertheless this is one of the best action adventure movies in many years released by the American popcorn factory.Also, loved the cast too. I loved the fact they were all fresh faces, or mostly are not exactly part of the star system. John Carter of Mars starring Tom Cruise would never be the same.Overall, i cannot wait to get this movie in DVD or blue-ray! I think everyone in this production should be congratulated, specially who wrote this and the director ! Well done Disney ! Now make another please.Now i have to go back and read the books once again...oh well...",John Carter
166,garethvk,John Carter is an Enjoyable Action Film and a Nice Surprise,7,9 March 2012,"Edgar Rice Burroughs is famous for literary creations that have inspired countless generations and given birth to numerous film and television projects. You would be hard-pressed to find anybody not familiar with Tarzan, one of Burrough's great series. John Carter of Mars is another one, and at long last has finally made it to the big screen.The film is based on the first book of eleven, a series that began in 1911 and ran through 1964 when the last book was published posthumously. John Carter stars Tylor Kitsch as the title character, a bitter Civil War veteran who, despite an accomplished service record, no longer wants anything to do with the military. Instead he is fixated upon finding a cave of gold.Despite the fact that he served for the Confederacy, John Carter draws the attention of the U.S. Cavalry whose leader is anxious to recruit an officer of Carter's skills and experience to aid them in their skirmishes with the Apache tribes. No longer willing to fight or get involved, Carter declines the offer but soon finds himself caught in the middle of an unplanned battle between both sides. As he attempts to find shelter for himself and a wounded officer, Carter accidentally stumbles upon the cave of gold he was seeking.Carter's surprise soon turns to shock when he's attacked by a mysterious individual who presses a glowing amulet in his hand and utters a phrase that transports John Carter instantly to the planet Mars. Of course, Carter at first has no idea where he is but soon realizes that he has incredible leaping abilities due to the lower gravity of the planet.Shortly after his arrival he gains the attention of Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe), the chief of a race of tall, skinny, four armed alien warriors. At first intrigued by Carter, Tarkas and his people become divided over what to do with the new arrival. This becomes further complicated when airships arrive and begin a massive gunbattle. Carter immediately leaps into action with his newfound ability which quickly gains the attention of Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins), princess of the city of Helium.It is learned that Princess Dejah is being forced to marry an evil warlord who possesses an awesome destructive ability and is using it to subjugate all those he encounters. Desperate to save their city, the princess is offered up to appease the warlord. Naturally this does not sit well with the free-spirited and feisty princess and before long she and John Carter find themselves united in their quest to save Helium. Despite his reluctance to get involved and fight, Carter realizes the princess may be his only way to get home. A stranger in a strange land, with danger all around him, John Carter takes his audience on an epic adventure. Despite having little star power, the movie works exceptionally well with amazing special effects. The CGI used to create the various alien characters infuses them with personality and vitality rarely seen in artificially created characters. The film is visually spectacular from the legions of aliens locked in combat, to the stark splendor of the planet and its inhabitants. Even though the film was presented in converted 3-D which, as many of you will know has long been a very touchy subject with me, the final product was actually better than most conversions. While it was nowhere near the quality of films shot in 3-D, it nonetheless offered an immersive quality to epic battle scenes and did not rely on the gimmicky trick of trying to make things pop out of the screen in order to sell the film.Kitsch does a great job handling the action of the film and manages to interact with his CGI costars in a believable enough manner to establish as much chemistry with them as he did with the flesh and blood Collins. Although some moments of the film drag, it does have enough action to sustain the nearly two-hour runtime with a touch of humor and romance thrown in for good measure.I first became aware of the film a year ago at the D23 Expo when Disney showed a few clips and had Kitsch, Collins and Dafoeon hand to promote the pending release. While intriguing, I did not see anything that really made the film stand out as a must-see. I am very happy to say that upon seeing the completed film, the scenes that were shown to us not only had even greater effects in the finished product but were also much more entertaining and dynamic once shown within the full context of the story line.Director Andrew Stanton, who has made a name for himself with his animated films at Pixar, skillfully blends live-action and CGI to create a very energetic and enjoyable action-adventure film that was a very pleasant surprise.While the acting, character development, and plot are nothing spectacular in and of themselves, they combined well and set the stage effectively for what should be a series of John Carter films in the future.3.5 stars out of 5",John Carter
167,bdgill12,Could Have Been Better But Not Nearly As Bad As The Reviews,6,15 March 2012,"It isn't often these days that a film comes around that can truly be called an epic flop. With home viewing options becoming more and more affordable, higher ticket prices inflating the true box office value of most movies, and the ever-expanding overseas markets, it's become quite difficult for a film to lose a ridiculous sum of money. Even recent domestic flops like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (which grabbed only $90 million on these shores versus a $200 million budget) scored big overseas, allowing Disney to save face. Mars Needs Moms comes to mind as a tremendous failure but that status is at least somewhat cushioned by the fact that no one expected much from it and it essentially sat on a shelf in the Disney vault prior to its release. Epic flops like Waterworld, Cleopatra, and Cutthroat Island just don't happen anymoreuntil now.After discovering a mythical cave of gold, surly Civil War vet John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) suddenly awakens to find himself on an unknown plain on what he soon discovers is Mars (or Barsoom, as the natives call it). The thinner atmosphere imbues his earth-body with near super powers as he can run faster, jump higher, and punch harder than he ever could back home. John is taken captive by the Tharks, a tall alien race with four arms, and their leader Tars Tarkas (voiced by Willem Dafoe), and remains a prized pet until he saves Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins), a princess of a humanoid race, from the clutches of the feared warlord Sab Than (Dominic West). Before long, John is embroiled in a Martian war that threatens to spread to earth if a group of powerful beings, known as the Therns, are not stopped.In a piece I wrote before John Carter debuted, I detailed the numerous missteps Disney made during the production of this film that led to its inevitable flopitude (a word I just made up but which fits perfectly in my mind). As a true fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs' books, I was already disappointed going in over the poor handling and I'm even more disappointed now. At its heart, John Carter is a darn good, enjoyable, popcorn flick. It was blessed with an entertaining, simple source material that seems ripe for adaptation if done correctly and a strong cast of characters, both on screen and off, were brought together to put this film together. The execution, however, is deeply flawed.Beyond the issues detailed in my preview piece (obscene and unnecessary budget, limited familiarity with the subject, and an egregious marketing campaign), the on-screen product suffers more than anything else from a weak script. The dialogue isn't bad (somewhat surprising) but many of the plot points are convoluted and poorly developed. If I didn't have previous knowledge of this series, I'm not sure I could have accurately followed along with the course of the action. This is a puzzling issues for me because, as much as this sci-fi nerd loves Edgar Rice Burroughs, his work isn't especially complex. This should have been an easy story to tell and instead it seems that writer/director Andrew Stanton couldn't figure out how to translate the book to film. Too much attention is paid to plot points that aren't especially important but not enough time is given to the significant portions of the narrative. Not only does that cause confusion, it also leads to boredom as I had to fight the urge to zone out more than once and my viewing partner (read: ""gracious wife"") became borderline disinterested at times. John Carter is also overly long and never finds much of a rhythm, leading to the dreaded roller coaster effect which hampers so many blockbusters.It's a real shame, too, because what John Carter does well, it does REALLY well. The vast majority of the $250 million spent on this movie was used in the visual departments and that definitely shows. Stanton and his team bring a fresh look to Mars and its inhabitants and give real life to Burroughs' visions. It is a beautiful print with lavish colors and the blending of live action with computer generated images is seamless. Most of the actors are given little to work with but Dafoe, Mark Strong, and Ciaran Hinds all give the workmanlike performances that you might expect. Collins does an admirable if not entirely believable job of combining elements of both the damsel and distress and the strong, confident warrior woman. Some of her moments are better than others but on the whole, she comes through. Kitsch is really the only member of the cast who is asked to do much of the heavy lifting and for my money he gets the job done quite well. Kitsch exudes rugged charm in every role, a necessary part of the John Carter persona, and here he displays a comedic timing that I wasn't sure he had. There are shades of Harrison Ford and Timothy Olyphant (I wish I could take credit for this comparison but that honor belongs to Christopher Orr of The Atlantic) within this performance, a characteristic that gives me great hope for Kitsch's career moving forward. At the end of the day, John Carter is an acceptable way to pass the time; no more and no less. At times it is quite fun though I think some more action sequences would have helped to lessen the strain of the narrative-related doldrums. It's just too bad that Disney didn't impose more checks and balances, both on set and on the studio end, to keep John Carter from becoming an epic financial blunder.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",John Carter
168,valen060,John Carter: Stunningly Effective,9,9 March 2012,"Hearing about this Disney film's story sparked my interest in seeing this right away! I finally did and overall, the characters, the setting, and the plot flowed seamlessly well together! It's like Disney's formula of ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" meets ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time."" So, the plot revolves around a Civil War veteran who is somehow transported to Barsoom (aka Mars), where he must help a princess and a colony succeed in a heated battle against another feuding colony.Director Andrew Stanton delivered well in this epic take of John Carter. Sure, star Taylor Kitsch seems like he's trying a little too hard as the lead guy, but it looks like he's heading toward the same path left behind by Jake Gyllenhaal for ""Prince of Persia"": serious character figure, yet sometimes able to show unintentional humor usually without noticing. Though not bad on either one's part! Since John Carter was conceived as a story back in 1912 by Edgar Rice Burroughs (of Tarzan fame), I have to say that this movie is certainly NOT a rip-off. A film like this deserves more credit than initially given! Epic action/adventure films like ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" wouldn't exist today without these early roots! It pretty much sparked an influence on the sci-fi, action, adventure genre films that most audiences came to know decades later.It looks like Stanton's following exactly what his fellow Pixar colleague Brad Bird had done with Tom Cruise in ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol,"" stepping up as director for once in live-action! Not bad for their first time.",John Carter
169,Field78,"An otherworldly, good old-fashioned adventure movie that's not a complete no-brainer",8,18 March 2016,"A lot has been said about this movie. That it had quite a massive budget for an acclaimed director who had never done a live-action film before. That it bombed spectacularly as a result of poor marketing. That it was an unexpected success overseas, but still lost the studio millions of dollars. That it was a dull rip-off of many other sci-fi adventure films, with too much focus on CGI and special effects. What has NOT been said enough is how much good old fun this movie is. Going to a movie that failed commercially always seems a risk of not getting your money's worth, but I was won over by the spectacular trailer that promised an immersive world full of exotic people and architecture, as well as plenty of action and adventure. And often you find that the trailer grossly misrepresents the movie by containing a shot of every key scene, leaving little new to be found in the movie. However, I found that JC delivered exactly what the trailer promised, maybe even more.JC starts with a brief introductory narration explaining that we're on Mars, followed by a spectacular action scene in the air. It sets the tone for the rest of the movie where John Carter, a disillusioned Civil War veteran, gets stuck on Mars with no idea how he got there and what is going on. There is no extensive prologue, no scrolling text or studio-mandated voice over explaining everything in detail every 15 minutes. It is a way of storytelling that I like, a narrative that challenges us to piece the background and current situation together for ourselves, rather than presenting it to us on a platter, which seems more common these days. Most likely this is thanks to director Andrew Stanton, who undoubtedly resisted suggestions in this direction. Some people complained that JC was needlessly confusing, but I retort that we as the audience know exactly as much as John Carter knows, so I could identify with him in his search for answers without problems.What also stands out in the positive sense is the running time. With 132 minutes, JC is considerably longer than the standard adventure movie that usually has to keep way too fast a pace in order to stay within 100 minutes, so that the cinemas can do multiple screenings in one day. I think it really benefits JC's story of exploration and the pacing; there is no feeling of a movie rushing through its expository scenes in order to quickly get from action scene to action scene, and there is plenty of room for some light-hearted humor, a bit of drama, and even romance. Special kudos for one scene that effectively combines a brutal fight with a grief-filled flashback. It is too bad that so many people missed the movie due to the ineffective marketing, because JC is really a film that caters to many audiences.Those who crave some eye-popping action won't be disappointed. The special effects, certainly in combination with Michael Giacchino's riveting score, are really stunning and spectacular, especially in 3D. There were lots of complaints about too much of it being computer-generated. I have never quite understood the general audience's problems with CGI; it only seems to be an issue when the movie itself is considered underwhelming (you don't hear anyone complain about the extensive CGI in Lord of the Rings, Sin City or Avatar, for example). It all looked very convincing to me, from the beautifully designed cities and airships to the motion-control Tharks. And if special effects are convincing, it shouldn't matter how they were done. Another grievance often heard is that JC looks too much like the Star Wars movies, especially the prequels (also movies unnecessarily criticized, IMO). If we ignore the fact that the Star Wars saga and many others were heavily influenced by the John Carter novel series, I'd like to point out that superficial similarities have become inherent to many genres like young adult movies, and it doesn't stop them from being appreciated and successful. Those who do not mind a feeling of familiarity should have no problems with JC if they can enjoy the story and the action. In a bold move, the director purposely chose not to include A-list names to draw in audience, so I saw no glaring miscasts. Although people may have had problems with Taylor Kitsch, who does a good job as reluctant hero, but comes over as too stoic and serious at times. There is more to enjoy in the supporting cast: Mark Strong is a strong screen presence as ever, and Lynn Collins is as stunningly beautiful as she is strong and resourceful. Ciaran Hinds and James Purefoy, both veterans of 'Rome', always enjoy a good chemistry together and bring in some levity, but by far the best work is done by Willem Dafoe, who makes his animated Tars Tarkas a lively and lovable character. But every scene gets stolen by Woola, the Martian dog and funniest side-kick in years.In conclusion, while not being daringly original, JC is a well-told adventure movie that has a pleasantly old-fashioned feeling to it. I highly recommend people to look beyond their low expectations, because although this classic story may feel a bit like science-fiction pulp these days, it is a very entertaining one, and those who can appreciate similar movies like Stargate will probably have a good time with it.",John Carter
170,robinski34,"It's Space Opera, Jim - not Aida!",9,22 June 2013,"Ignore the sniping campaign that beset John Carter from before it was even released and watch this movie through the lens of some important facts. Edgar Rice Burroughs' first story was serialised in 1912, and he invented much of the language of modern SF stories, arguably doing more than anyone to create the Space Opera form that long after spawned Star Trek, Star Wars and all that followed them. To say that we have seen before most of what Andrew Stanton puts on screen is a narrow view, and to say that it is confusing implies a conscious unwillingness to put some thought into following the story (that's you, Dr. Kermode). It's sad to think that we will probably not see any of the other books now, all because of the deliberately constructed scuttlebutt designed to sabotage the film. Mark Strong and James Purefoy have both alluded to this in interview and how completely disproportionate that opprobrium was. Those of us who are fans can only hope that John Carter becomes the long term success that it deserves to be, it's a cracking adventure movie, Lynn Collins is every inch the feisty Martian princess and definitely could take Princess Leia in a fight (no blasters allowed). The cast is filled out with a mighty throng of British thesps, including the aforementioned plus Samantha Morton, Ciaran Hinds and Dominic West, and the mighty Bryan Cranston and Thomas Haden Church are also present. But what about Taylor Kitsch? Well he does just fine, the role is not taxing and he's got the muscles for it, I mean come on, it's space opera, not Aida.",John Carter
171,jckruize,Opulent but dull.,5,16 March 2012,"OK, somewhere between the gushers' and the haters' comments is the reality that this isn't a bad movie. Just not a good one.Clearly the filmmakers loved their source material and tried their best to do it justice. There's plenty of stunning design work, superbly-rendered CGI and overall high production values. Disney might have spent a dismaying quarter of a billion dollars on this hoped-for 'tentpole' entertainment, but at least the money is on the screen.The actors are decent too, within the confines of the trite dialogue and genre conventions that don't really clarify the plot. As the titular hero, Taylor Kitsch is especially effective as a man of action with a troubled past and not a lot of excess body fat.The problem is that it's all been done and seen before. When Edgar Rice Burroughs first dreamed of Barsoom, his notions of flying machines held aloft by sunlight, warring tribes fighting with swords and rayguns, and beautiful princesses with combat skills were innovative and helped establish the nascent genre of science fiction and 'planetary romance.' But that was back in 1912, and there's been a lot of plundering of his ideas over the decades since. People like George Lucas and James Cameron readily acknowledge their creative debts to Burroughs and his contemporaries.The result is that there's absolutely nothing new in this elaborate cinematic construct. All the gorgeous detail and VFX gloss are mere window dressing to a tired tale of swashbuckling, monsters, and battling hordes.And come on -- not only do modern schoolchildren know that Mars is an arid world with virtually no atmosphere, but a good number probably also are aware that its gravity is about 40% of Earth's. So why is John Carter able to leap HUNDREDS of feet into the air, or swing a giant boulder and chain like a yo-yo? The filmmakers provide no explanation for this idiocy.I will let them off for the truncated and ridiculous title, though. That smacks of a gutless studio marketing decision.",John Carter
172,s_campanale,Old school 80s homage that is not the failure people are saying.,10,13 April 2012,"I openly admit that I absolutely love ""John Carter""(of Mars). During its all too brief cinema lifespan in the UK I managed to watch it 5 times, with a hunger still for many more viewings when it arrives on DVD. The reason for this devotion is mainly that it brought back so vividly those childhood-teenage years watching marvellous films like ""Krull"" ""Dragon slayer"" ""Willow"" ""Dark Crystal"" ""Dune"" ""Legend"" ""Labyrinth"" ""Flash Gordon"" ""Conan/Red Sonja"", the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy and all the other early-mid 80s classics at my local cinema. The film is so unashamedly ""old school"" despite the cutting edge CGI effects, that to see it on the big screen is almost like a joyful form of time travel for any late 30s-early 40s cinema goer! (As a highly romantic teenager I used to dream of the time I would find my own ""Princess"" and she turned up a few years later. By a happy coincidence the film came out the week we were celebrating 25 years of our first meeting, which made the film feel even more special for these two lifelong film nerds!) Reading many comments and blog reviews I found we were not alone in this feeling! It isn't only in tone and style, but also in the score (by Micheal Giacchino, the most ""old school"" New-School composer) the costumes and architecture, and the fact that it was shot in Britain just as those old classics were, with a supporting cast of familiar British faces backing two relatively unknown (and cheap) American leads. Back then it was for tax reasons, but one wonders whether shooting here (rather than say current tax-break locations like Prague or Germany) was another detail added to the deliberate ""80s classic"" homage? But it would be wrong to simply praise this film for recreating so perfectly a now bygone age of cinematic adventure- It is 2012 after all. This film stands out because it was made with a certain thing that we Italians call ""Amore"" (Love) To make something ""with Love"" means to make it as beautiful and as well made as you possibly can, to put your heart and soul into it. After years of Hollywood pumping out increasingly identikit pieces of ""product"" seemingly only developed as far as the initial brainstorm stage and then left to flounder and slowly die before us as it's rushed in on time like some shoddy builders fulfilling a contractual obligation with no apparent care for the end result, it is so heartening to see films of some actual ""quality"" appear! "". ""The Hunger Games"" is another good example of a well-made current blockbuster, and one hopes this trend will last. Acting wise Taylor Kitsch is a likable hero (who is also very good in ""Battleship"") who can be the classic scoundrel /rogue but also the noble hero as well, and he reminds me a lot of Harrison Ford. Lynn Collins is a likable Princess, who often needs rescuing but who is also a tough cookie herself. (Side note – My Wife joked during the first screening that for a character who is famously depicted as an unfeasibly pneumatic sex fantasy, she was a little lacking in the heaving bosom department!) Mark Strong plays Mark Strong (cool sophisticated villain) and Domenic West plays Domenic West (sleazy scummy type) while Ciaran Hinds and James Purfoy make for likable ""hero types"". The motion capture on Dafoe, Church, Morton and Walker is so good you can actually see it is them despite the alien shape. A lot of thought has gone into the various cultures of Barsoom, for example the sex equality that exists in the militaries of both Helium and Zodanga (Half the soldiers on both sides are female as are the crew of the light ships) and that fact that Helium's architecture, ships and armour are shiny and bright while those of Zodanga are dull, rusty and functional. The culture of the Tharks is also fascinating, blending Viking with Native American and African in a way far superior to the happy rainbow land of the new-age Naa'vi in ""Avatar"" Having so praised this film it's sad to see it casually mocked and attacked by both professional critics and IMDb users/bloggers. Where all the hate and venom is coming from and why I do not know? The word ""failure"" is used to describe it, but that seems to be partially wishful thinking on some people's part and partially insufficient Box Office returns for its massive budget. From what I saw and have heard, the film has been quite popular with ordinary film goers, especially here in Europe. True it lost money and got panned on release, but then so did many of the above-mentioned films and others besides which are now considered absolute cult classics and treasures, and I have no doubt that in say 20 years time, ""JC"" will be considered a beloved cult classic also. That it has lost money now is not the real issue, it is that this film was made at all, and now exists, and future generations will be thankful for it. The 30-40 somethings now running Disney grew up loving those old classics as we all did, and seem determined to carry on the brave policy of making daring, strange and potentially difficult films that do not treat their audience like fools. I pray only that they have the courage to stick with their course and not be scared off, because guys and girls, it really IS worth it in the end!",John Carter

Here is a concept that's big enough to spawn its own franchise. Heck, I'm already saving up for the Happy Meal collectibles it will inspire at McDonalds. The movie's franchise-sized idea holds good potential, but too much set-up is dedicated into this one movie that there is isn't anything in it except for those darn set- ups.The film follows the journey of John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), a Civil War Veteran from Virginia who isn't in good terms with the local authorities. His attempts to elude imprisonment lead him to a cave with a well-dressed alien loitering within it. He knocks the bastard down. It instinctively pulls out a glowing medallion and starts reciting something in its native language. Carter grabs the medallion, and before he could sell it to the nearest pawnshop, he is transported to Mars. It is there where he comes across with the green-skinned, four-eyed Tharks. Fascinating creatures these Tharks are.

The climatic scenes were showy but also I have seen it in countless other movies and basically I was quite disappointed.

177,Deckard-16,Wonderful old fashioned sci-fi epic!,8,18 March 2012,"WOW! This is a much better film than a lot of the ""lame stream media"" has given it credit for.Andrew Stanton's jump into live action is every bit as enjoyable as his excellent animated films like ""Wall*E"" & ""Finding Nemo"".This fantastical tale of warring Martians clans & an American Civil War calvary man who inexplicably gets caught up in the middle of it all is strictly for romantics who want a rollicking good time at the theater.The acting is universally fine with leading man, Taylor Kitsch, commanding it with all the authority his role demands. Actors like Willem Dafoe & Thomas Hayden Church shine although they're completely unrecognizable as 12 foot tall green 4-armed Tharks.The effects are constantly breathtaking. Mars/Barsoom has never looked so thrillingly un-Earth(Jarsoom)like.Despite its over 2 hour length this movie never dragged.The script & dialog are far better than the so-called critics say it is.I burned through the book last summer, loved its almost quaint treatment about all things sci-fi, honor, loyalty & love. This movie did not let me down. Stanton has taken his passion for the material & has produced a movie that is much more entertaining than Peter Jackson's equally lovingly produced & directed Lord Of The Rings trilogy.I just hope Disney doesn't give up on this movie (as it looks like they will) because I really look forward to the next John Carter Of Mars film.See this movie in 3-D.(The post conversion sets a new standard for such work.)",John Carter
178,elliott78212,Edgar Rice Burroughs Would be Proud,8,17 March 2012,"Wow, completely unexpected Epic Science Fiction, the feel of the movie reminded me of Star Wars like the first time I met Luke Skywalker today I met John Carter and it was a treat. The story has so much room to grow but if it doesn't I'm satisfied now, because the story is well told the characters developed the special effects are well done and thoughtful we saw it in 3D and it was perfectly executed. Performances all around are even and solid, believable. Writer Director Andrew Stanton who I might add wrote one of the best truly Sci-Fi Disney Animated films of all time Wall-E shows his love and appreciation for the genre and the source material I was in a word Impressed and recommend anyone to go see this movie there is something for all ages and its Big and no Sci-Fi Buff should miss this thrilling Adventure Edgar Rice Burroughs would be proud to see his work on the big silver screen adapted with love and affection.",John Carter
179,brent_or,"Take it for what it is, a terrific film!",9,2 February 2013,"I was not sure whether I would like John Carter. The previews were just confusing, and even after I did some research into the source material (the novel ""A Princess of Mars""), it still seemed like it could be hit or miss. But I checked it out on the big screen anyway, and I completely loved it. I think that it was an exceptionally well-crafted film in pretty much every single respect across the board, and one of the most enjoyable theater experiences that I have had in a long time. I had the biggest, most genuine, childlike smile on my face when the last image flashed across the screen.Now, this is a fantasy-type tale based on an early science-fiction novel. Meaning that it is probably not going to appeal to people who are into ""hard sci-fi"" or speculative stories that are rigorously based in modern astrophysics, postmodern dystopian bleakness and so forth. Along with that, if you do not enjoy bright, colorful, fun fantasy films, you may very well not like John Carter all that much. That is okay; everyone has different tastes. But for my money, taken for what it is, this is a wonderfully good film.The cast did very well, the visual effects were beautifully imaginative, the pacing seemed perfect, there were some great moments of humor, and the unusual plot did not give itself away until the end. I am a big classic Star Wars fan who was extremely disappointed by Episodes I and II; John Carter gets right what those films got wrong, absolutely blowing them out of the water. It is an example of a terrific sci-fi/fantasy film that holds plenty of appeal for younger viewers without making excuses or throwing good filmmaking out the door.It is unfortunate that John Carter was apparently the biggest box office loss of all time (relative to its huge budget), but that is not to be blamed on the quality of the film itself. Perhaps it was never meant to be a huge hit, but I am glad that it was made. I hope that it becomes a cult classic; if so, sign me up. Highly, highly recommended.",John Carter
180,kevinmorice,Flash Gordon for 21st Century,7,17 March 2012,"John Carter is a surprisingly effective cheesy slice of sci-fi. It is your standard fish-out-of-water sci-fi flick. It is a bit Phantom Menace, a bit Stargate, a bit Avatar, but unlike those films it make no pretence at being the next big thing in sci-fi movies. Think of it more as an updated Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers. I was expecting Taylor Kitsch to struggle a bit to lead the movie, and in all truth his character does seem to adapt a bit too well to the four armed aliens and the flying skiffs. However, I was also expecting to see Riggins peeping out from behind John Carter and was pleased that within the first few minutes I had totally forgotten his past.Lynn Collins manages the opposite trick equally well. She has been instantly forgettable in everything else she has passed through but does enough here to stand out.Being Disney they managed to throw plenty of weight onto the background and smaller characters as well. Dominic West, Mark Strong, James Purefoy, Ciaran Hinds all hold their roles on the screen, and Willem Defoe et al give the Tarkus enough individual characterisation to tell them apart. I doubt the book lovers are going to be pleased about what has been done to Edgar Rice Burrough's work but there is only so much that can be done to squeeze a book onto the screen and this doesn't fall a long way short of what could have been done reasonably with what they had.I wouldn't bet against a sequel either. I think there is room for more from the same characters and I think the word of mouth is going to turn this into a financial slow-burner that will make Disney enough that they will already be wondering about who they have retained contracts on.",John Carter

183,DJRMewzique,A great film to see Kitsch's body...but you won't get much else out of it. (Not that there's anything wrong with that...),6,17 March 2012,"""Before 'Star Wars'....before 'Avatar'....there was...John Carter."" Yeah, um, referring to those two films in the same breath as ""John Carter"" is a huge misnomer. ""John Carter"" is nowhere close to the same league.Not even remotely.Not to say the film isn't entertaining. The story of, um, well, John Carter is that of a military captain who gets transported from the 1800s to Mars where he has extraordinary physical prowess and gets caught between a war going on between the inhabitants of the planet, and, of course, coming off as the hero.However, despite the cool visuals, especially when viewed on IMAX 3D, and Taylor Kitsch's incredibly beautiful and always half-naked body, the film itself is just a wee bit TOO Disney and ultimately pretty forgettable. It rolls along with a good enough pace, and the inclusion of Willem Defoe and Thomas Haden Church in alien roles that render them unrecognizable is pretty cool, but really the only thing I truly took from this film is, um, yep...Kitsch has one hot body.A number of reviews have mentioned the fact that Kitsch ended up being to ""pretty"" for the role and I could not even begin to understand how anyone could make that statement. Until I saw the film. Yes, somehow, Kitsch indeed was just too pretty for the role. His looks and musculature overtook every scene he was in and rendered him otherwise shallow. With no chemistry at all between him and anyone else in the film, it was hard to take anything going on on screen seriously, and the end product really is just a shallow, meaningless fluff film that will not do much than push Kitsch's sex-symbol image further.If this is the Year of the Kitsch, I guess we'll have to see what he does in ""Battleship"" and Oliver Stone's ""Savages"" before we can see if he has been worth the investment. However, if a movie will show off his best assets, you can assume I'll find my way to the theatre.",John Carter
184,DunkelheitVZ,"flawed, but good",7,23 September 2016,"Let us try with the positive perspective: The movie looks and feels amazing, production values are enormous. The green alien race is done very, very well, special effects nearly flawless and done way better than in other movies. The story is OK (nothing special, but no story is when big money is involved, they always go the safe path), characters are OK (a little bit more gray than black and white would have been enjoyable) and the flow is OK, too. I see two big problems with the movie though. The first is, that this movie takes place on Mars. This might have flown at the time when the books were written, but it does not fly now. We know that there are no alien races on Mars. It would have been a wise decision to make this happen in a whole other solar system. The second strike is (sadly) Dominic West. I love this guy, but he does not fit into the role of an emperor on another planet. And in this movie, it shows. West is neither charismatic nor colorful enough. I don't know about you, but these two problems took away a lot of immersion for me. And this is why I can only rate the movie 7 points, even though 8 seems more appropriate. This is still very good entertainment and I even liked the movie more in the 2nd view.",John Carter
185,MajBlade2,Huge fan of the books wanted to like this..but,4,16 June 2019,"Ok I read the whole series of books as a kid. People forget Burroughs wrote these for adults so there is more sex and violence in them then people realize so all these films of tarzan and the earlier attempts of john carter of mars were awful.
Now im not one of those true believers in putting whats in the book exactly on screen even if now you almost can do it. Frankly I haven't read the books in 30 years now so dont remember anything but the broad outlines of the story.
I can say I was totally disappointed. I think it starts with Taylor kitsch didn't really believe him as john carter. In the low gravity he could not only jump but was much stronger then everyone else which they had played that for more.
Im not sure what I wanted from this movie but I really didnt get it. It was confusing even for me and didnt have the heart I would have liked to seen.
Should have given it to Peter Jackson and his writing group that did LOTR",John Carter
186,cyifly-2,Amazingly Original and Quite Good.,8,28 May 2012,"This movie -- believe it or not -- was good. Very original. Good special effects. Decent script. Decent job with the acting. Good action. The best part was, I was expecting it to be terrible, and was very pleasantly surprised.I'm not going to load you down with all the different plot summaries, I just tell you if it's worth seeing. John Carter is worth seeing.In a time where everything seems to be a sequel, prequel, a remake, a re-release in 3D, or just plain bad, this was a very original, good story and kudos to Disney for getting it out there. I'm not even a huge sci-fi fan. But this was one that had the most unique styles to it that I've ever seen. Kind of reminded me of Indiana Jones meets Star Wars -- Except not seeming to be the same old cake with different icing. It was a big risk to take because it was not known if this was going to be a 'cash cow' like all the re-hashed mish-mash that studios seem to keep cranking out -- And I'm glad they took it. Hopefully it will make room for more original ideas to make their way out of the pile of same-old, same-old we seem to keep getting. Nicely done.BTW -- This movie gets a lot of bad press. It keeps being called a ""BOMB"" at the box office, but it banked almost $300,000,000.00 worldwide. I would like to be on the receiving end of that bomb.",John Carter
187,aaronjbong,Jumping on Mars Seems Like a Lot of Fun,7,17 March 2012,"Who is John Carter? John Carter is a Civil War veteran who gets transported to Mars (or Barsoom, as they say) using a mysterious device (a medallion). There, he grabs the attention of four-armed, green, 15-feet creatures (known as Tharks) due to his superhuman jumping skills (thanks to the lower gravitational force present in Mars). There, he gains some recognition and is forced to be involved in a series of battles, all part of a war between the city of Helium and Zodanga, as well as decide the fate of the planet.Now that you've met John Carter, let's introduce you to Mars/Barsoom, the ""Red Planet"".Barsoom is where the film takes place. It's similar to Earth (Jasoom)in ways but also different in other ways. There's oxygen (as John Carter is able to breathe normally, although he might have inhaled some other type of gas), and there's water (in the form of rivers and lakes, but no oceans). However, organisms who inhabit the planet are driven by blue blood, not red Earth blood. There's a smaller gravitational force present (which allows not only John Carter, but any other Earthling to jump like Superman). There are no plants, no sign of botany. And they speak a different language, however John is able to understand the Barsoom language due to a special drink. And the best part: there are two moons.Barsoom, compared to Earth is much more technologically advanced. There are futuristic flying ships present, artistic buildings, and flying bikes (something like that). It's definitely more advanced than us. But for some reason, their fashion is just ancient (John Carter is shirtless for most of the time in Barsoom), and most of the landscape is deserted, empty. The sort of games they play is what the Romans played back in Caesar area: gladiatorial games. (There's one entertaining scene in particular for that.) Disney has spent $250 million on this film and marketed it aggressively. However, the trailers didn't give provide anything interesting and didn't gain audiences' interest, therefore gained a weak opening weekend gross. Put that aside, ""John Carter"" is actually dazzling, entertaining, and very fun to watch. The fantasy themes intertwine with science-fiction elements perfectly. It is just marvelous.With the production budget of the flick reaching $250 million, the visual effects of the film is incredible. The sets, and creatures of the planet were very realistic and very jaw-dropping. The one action scene I liked the most was the gladiatorial game held in the land of the Tharks where Carter, Sola (a Thark), and Tarkas (another Thark) had to fight against two monstrous, giant-sized, eyeless, white apes. And the 3D: the 3D effects here were worth noting and recommended.The outstanding special effects lead to the amazing, and widely entertaining action sequences. John Carter uses his swords as his weapon and does swordplay against the inhabitants of Barsoom. The inhabitants of Barsoom are no match for John Carter, regardless of their weapons and fighting skills, thanks to Carter's extraordinary jumping skills and outstanding sword-fighting skills. John Carter is just invincible and too strong for Barsoomians. However, there was some problem with the storytelling as it was not able to tie up loose ends. In the middle of the film, we encounter this power source or something, the ninth ray. It seems like something special, something revolutionary, something vital to the story. But then, there's not a trace of it later on. What's happened to it? What's the significance of this power? What is it capable of? Nothing.The actors' performances were satisfying enough. Taylor Kitsch is a very suitable John Carter and gives a satisfying performance, although not Oscar worthy. The beautiful Lynn Collins plays the role of the Martian Princess Dejah Thoris with style and determination. The other supporting cast also did well. Some of the characters who appear in CGI have also been given outstanding voices by the talented supporting cast. Anyone who loved ""Avatar"", or ""Star Wars"" would definitely enjoy this flick. It offers a blend of fantasy and science-fiction and is perfect for audiences of all ages. The children will love the technology incorporated, the older kids will clamor the dazzling special effects, and the adults will enjoy the love story and action scenes.Rating: 7/10Final Verdict: ""John Carter"" is a film that offers a perfect blend of fantasy and science-fiction accompanied with satisfying performances and spectacular visual effects.",John Carter
188,ChristianUnchained,"Naysayers be banned, John Carter is classic Sci-Fi",9,23 April 2013,"This is why we go to the movies. Ever since the teaser trailer last year, I've been hyped to see John Carter. And now the hype is justified. Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' original science fiction novel written more than 100 years ago, John Carter is what the movies are made for. To tell a story, transport you entirely to a different place and become enveloped in that world. This is a film that tickles the imagination in just the right ways and makes us remember why we go to the movies. It's a magical film. It truly is, and here's why: In John Carter, you feel like an active participant in the film. Most movies feel on rails, like you are viewing the character rather than traveling along with character; on-rails filmmaking is important, but it is not necessarily the most involving film technique. Sci-Fi films like the Matrix or Star Wars are fantastic films because we follow very unique characters and watch them as they grow; and you feel like you're growing along with the character due to the unique situations. It's hard to explain because films struggle with this today. Most films are made to be eye candy (Avatar), but John Carter aims to be involving and beautiful, and nails it. The first moments of John Carter are misleading, followed by mysterious, and then followed by wondrous. It's a really caustic combination, John Carter. But once it gets legs and starts to move along, John Carter unfolds into a fantastic Sci-Fi epic. John Carter is also filled with imagination. From the sets to the ships to the aliens to the costumes to the cities to the story to the art direction to the world of Barsoon itself, John Carter is bursting with a classy and original imagination. An imagination that is unscathed by today's pulp Sci-Fi, but rather an imagination that is highly original and incredibly old school. It's a simple story, but it works incredibly well. You've heard it many times in many different ways, but this (John Carter) is the source of all of that great science fiction that we've come to appreciate now in film form. John Carter is also surprisingly well paced. There are many films that aspire to tell great stories, but most of the time there are multiple plot jumps (and plot holes) that end up confusing the audience. Andrew Stanton is a great story teller (Finding Nemo, Wall-E, Toy Story 3), and his ability transfers onto the screen really well. There are two plot developments that feel like they were ""plopped"" in, where there needed to be some pre-explanation of what was happening. These plot jumps were mystifying, because the rest of the film is very well directed and very well told. Looks like there were some editing/directing hiccups. John Carter also features a phenomenal cast. It's made up of some surprising veterans, like Mark Strong (Sherlock Holmes) and Willem Dafoe (Spider Man). The main characters are less known, but do a great job. Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) and Lynn Collins (X Men Origins: Wolverine) do just fine, but Kitsch plays a really good John Carter. The performances are pretty solid, to be honest. They are nothing Oscar worthy, but considering the source material and the human/digital acting that makes performances sometimes good and sometimes downright terrible, the acting is pretty good. You'll roll hour eyes, and it can get kinda cheesy and mildly predictable in certain parts, but for the most part I was pretty surprised how many face palms I didn't do. If you're still reading this, then you've probably haven't made up your mind about John Carter. Let me assure you that John Carter is original, enveloping, and excellent. You feel engaged and active in the film as you explore this imaginative and carefully crafted moviescape, never feeling too dull or too fancy. John Carter hits the sweet spot of action, storytelling, and exploring an engaging world. You truly feel that you went to Mars and back. The characters you meet during the film are unique and engaging, both alien and human. Its script may stumble and plot lurch in random directions at a couple spots, but John Carter is ultimately a success, a surprisingly satisfying and wonderful Sci-Fi epic.",John Carter
189,seveb-25179,It Went Down Like A Lead Barsoom...,3,4 September 2019,"Great visuals, pity about the lack of plot and character development...
I just finished reading the first John Carter book -""A Princess Of Mars"", very imaginative story that must have been even more mind blowing back in 1912.
Contrary to what some have suggested, the movie does not follow the book very closely and unfortunately try's to cram in too many additional elements from later books, to the detriment plot and character development.
In fact, although the books are jam packed with colourful creatures and situations, the makers of the movie still find in necessary add additional elements which are not from the books, such as turning Zodanga into ""mobile walking machine city"", which it is not in the book. Or making the Therns shape shifters, which they are not in the books. It makes me wonder why they bothered to acquire the right to the books in the first place, if they want to change it so much? Given that almost no-one from this millennium, or even the second half of the last, will even have heard of the books, there's not much of a ""name recognition"" fan base factor to draw on, unlike, for example ""Lord of the Rings"".
The book is an fast paced adventure story, where the hero is thrown into strange environments where he survives, explores and learns to understand.
Learning about this strange new World is half the fun. The implications low gravity and fanciful explanation of the canals, which were accepted as reality at the time.
Although there are a number of plot holes (sometimes even noticed and pointed out by the characters themselves!), there are also many interesting concepts and points of view to savor.
This is where the movie falls down for me, aside from the most simplistic of stories, almost nothing is explained or explored, everything just happens in a vacuum, without any context.
The ""science"" in the original book is complete nonsense, but it has an internal logic which it adheres to consistently, which makes it relate-able. Whereas the movie is all sketchy superhero magic.
Another movie which reflects the shallow, video game nature of much youth entertainment these days",John Carter

I tried to get my friends to see it. But it flew so far under the radar nobody saw it in the theater. Very disappointing when a good movie suffers poor representation.One mistake the movie makes in the first ten minutes is when he blasphemes. It doesn't happen again the entire movie. But I think you have to be careful especially with Disney movies not to alienate parents who are curating content for their kids. It's sad if a lot of parents turned it off right at the beginning because they worry it's not appropriate for their kids. It wasn't necessary in the scene and my Spidey-sense said ""Uh-oh!""",John Carter
191,MovieSonic,Really fun and better than Avatar!,9,21 May 2012,"If you liked Avatar in general but thought the film itself overall (excluding the effects) was dull then this is basically Avatar 2.0Ignoring some rather racist overtones and obvious plot lines, Disney have kept the sappiness to a minimum and included enough well-timed humour throughout that kids and adults can enjoy this film.I'm honestly shocked by how good the film was, its main positives (for me) being;A leading man who is a genuinely good actor, will likely appeal to both sexes and brought a level of believability to his roleA leading lady who is not a skinny blonde (yay!), has some intelligence and doesn't really have to use her looks/charms to get what she wantsWhilst the plot is overdone and ""intensely"" racist, the humour throughout meant that you could see they weren't taking themselves too seriously and this helped me to enjoy the film for what it was; light but extremely fun entertainmentThe running time of the film was just right and meant that all the main characters were given enough history and screen time so that they felt three dimensional and therefore I cared about what happened to themI don't really care about SFX - as long as they are believable enough that they don't detract from my enjoyment of the film then I'm happy. The effects were mostly superb and some of the aliens were really cute! I don't really think there was anything particularly wrong with the film (other than the racism which I believe I may have mentioned earlier...) except I wish they would have renamed the city to something other than ""Helium"". I know it's taken from a book or something but still...really?!Anyway, if you're in the mood for an Avatar or Cowboys and Aliens type of film then this won't disappoint.Hugely entertaining and often funny, I vote 9/10",John Carter

They are certainly written on purpose. The box office says actually how good or bad the movie is. It is basically special effects with weak story and bad acting. The character development phase is very short (saying someones name hundred times is not character development) and this leads to a story that can not catch your attention. It was really not easy to watch it till the end. At some point movie makers will understand that CGI is not enough to make a movie.

Avatar, not John Carter that is. I mean, why call a film John Carter in the first place? You're kinda asking for trouble if you ask me!I won't bother boring you with the over complicated plot but I will start with the characters. I felt exactly the same about the characters in PS I Love You, & Leap Year, i.e.: if a bomb exploded and killed them off I wouldn't of cared, well, expect for the speedy frog of course, he was the only decent character in the film.I don't know anything about the Princess book it was taken from but the minute she appears on screen you already know the ending. OK, so she's hot, if a little old to be a princess.For a Disney film I was completely surprised by the lack of magic and beauty. OK, so the CGI was good, but it's become so boring now that you need something else, (Avatar and it's amazing 3d).The film is totally pointless. John Carter or Virgina as he is known by the green men jumps around loads, so what. I know it's fantasy but I couldn't help thinking what a bloody stupid film this really is. It's like Flash Gordon minus the camp and cool soundtrack.I'm still not sure who this film is aimed at.

But still it was a completely packed movie with a straight simple story but really nicely executed. I personally looked just once at my watch during the whole movie, therefore despite of its silly performance it was a breathtaking movie that i enjoyed nicely.

195,jaguiar313,"John Carter is fun but, a little too talky to really be out of this world",7,9 March 2012,"As a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian Chronicles, I have been waiting for someone to adapt these nearly 100 year old pulp sci-fi adventures to film since I was a boy. Now after years in development hell, Disney finally brings the adventures of Earthman John Carter to life. And it's a bit of a mixed bag. The simply named ""John Carter"" takes a lot of liberties with Burroughs' stories, too many to list here and in result comes up with a tale that is a bit talky and more plot heavy then needed. Burroughs' books were short, action packed and to the point. So should have John Carter been. But, this story of Confederate Captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) who is whisked to the planet Mars were he finds an ally in four-armed, green warrior Tars Tarkus (voiced by Willem Dafoe) and love with beautiful princess Dejah Thoris (who has now graduated from the damsel in distress in the books to also being a scientist and woman warrior played by Lynn Collins) is not all bad as directed by Andrew Stanton (director of Finding Nemo and Wall-E). Stanton may have written a lot of dialog scenes but, when there is action, it is fast moving and exciting and he gets good performances out of his cast. He does set a good pace for a film with a lot of plot and he does capture some of the pulp charm nicely in many scenes as well. It's too bad he couldn't follow Burroughs lead and keep John Carter a bit simpler and get to the spectacular action a bit sooner. I was never bored but, there is a lot of traveling back and forth before the plot really gets moving and Carter, with his enhanced abilities due to Mars' thinner atmosphere and lesser gravity, gets to the business of saving Mars and his lady love. Yes, plot and character development are important but, I still feel the film's 132 minutes could have been better managed. Criticisms aside, the film is sumptuously designed , the SPFX are flawless and there is nice atmosphere from Michael Giacchino's (Star Trek, Super 8) beautiful score. The enormous budget is on screen and despite it's flaws, the end had me wanting to see more of Carter's adventures on Barsoom (their name for Mars) as there are 11 books and now that the central characters have all been introduced, we can get right to the fun. And John Carter wasn't without fun, it just need a bit more of it.",John Carter
196,dagallop,"Filled in some gaps from the Edgar Rice Burroughs original, and deviated to an acceptable level!",10,10 December 2014,"I really enjoy reading anything from Edgar Rice Burroughs so it was with some reservations that I watch movies from such talented authors (keeping in mind his life story). But, I have to say that it maintained the thread, offered some insights into perceptions of the creatures described and wholly entertained. In fact, I would suggest that anyone having not read the series first, probably wouldn't have got as much from the screenplay! The acting was on-par with greats like Gladiator and the special effects were as can be expected from anything out of the Disney studios. On the whole I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes some cosmic swashbuckling alongside an interesting story line with some tantalizing caveats thrown in. Lest we should forget, Edgar Rice Burroughs was truly the sci-fi genius of his day and given that you will see many extractions in blockbuster movies such as Star Wars, you should give his books a going over as well while you are at it.",John Carter
197,DubhDoo,A wonderfully enjoyable sci-fi romp; there is indeed life on Mars.,8,4 January 2013,"'John Carter' was a long time coming. Some of the press releases and interviews remarked that it was ""a 100 years in the making""; well, that's not much of an exaggeration. Originally written in 1912, by Edgar Rice Burroughs (who would go on to create Tarzan), it was serialized in six monthly installments under the title 'A Princess of Mars'. Then, in 1931 'Looney Tunes' director Bob Clampett approached Burroughs to discuss the possibility of translating 'A Princess of Mars' into a feature-length animated film, essentially rendering it the first feature to be fully animated. It eventually fell apart and left to linger in development hell; animation maestro Ray Harryhausen expressed interest in it, but it wasn't until the 1980s that the project found its feet, as Disney bought the rights to John Carter, to compete with the popularity of 'Star Wars'. In the early 2000s, Paramount managed to win the rights to Burroughs' creation, with Robert Rodriguez signing on as director and Harry Knowles (who ignited Paramount's interest in Carter) was to be credited as a producer. This also ended unfortunately and Jon Favreau was brought in to tackle the film. However, despite making progress on the project, Paramount decided not to renew the rights, and 'A Princess of Mars' retreated back to Disney. It then ended up in the hands of Pixar man Andrew Stanton who had experienced hits with 'Finding Nemo' and 'WALL-E'. Everything magically fell into place and John Carter was brought to life.So after all this time is it any good? The answer, thankfully, is yes. Andrew Stanton has crafted a great and rollicking adventure movie that delivers enough pulpy thrills to make it an enjoyable sci-fi yarn. John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is a Civil War veteran, struggling to reconnect with the brave man he was in the war. One day however, the convoy he is part of is attacked by a group of Native Indians, forcing him to retreat into a cave where he encounters an alien being and is transported to Mars or ""Barsoom"", as its inhabitants call it. Our hero gets thrown into the midst of heated conflict between the twelve-foot tall and six limbed race called Tharks and the rival human-like cities of Zodanga and Helium. Carter meets a princess named Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) who believes she can help him to return to Earth, leaving him unsure whether he should go home or fight for Barsoom. Kitsch successfully manages to make John Carter a likable protagonist who's easy to root for. He has the physicality and presence needed to make him a believable action hero. His transition from embittered loner to a man of strong courage never feels forced or out-of-character, only natural. He gets a standout moment in the form of a scene where he single-handedly takes on an army of fierce Martians, which is intercut with a painful memory from his time of Earth; it's a masterstroke of spectacular action and blistering emotion. There's also a nice bromance bubbling under the surface between Carter and Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) which I'd have liked to have seen more of. Kitsch is supported by a strong cast including (a fine) Lynn Collins, Thomas Haden Church, Dominic West, Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, James Purefoy, Ciaran Hinds and the ever-great Bryan Cranston. And Woola, Carter's alien-dog sidekick is the most lovable CG-animal since Doug from the brilliant 'Up'.Succeeding on a technical level also, the world of 'John Carter' is a marvel to look at on screen, combining extraordinary yet real landscapes with brilliantly-alien sets and CGI-created architecture. It's a detailed fantasy world that feels alive. It also acts as a stage for the film's expertly-conceptualised action sequences, including a scene where Carter leaps between huge distances from ship to ship to save the princess. It's all complemented by Daniel Mindel's wonderfully widescreen lensing. While Michael Giacchino, no stranger to sci-fi having composed the score to JJ Abrams' brilliant 'Star Trek, accompanies the stunning visuals with a great soundtrack.It's far from perfect though. The script delivers its fair share of awfully clunky dialogue, ""He will spare Helium if you accept his hand in marriage"" or ""We have been born worlds apart but I know you, John Carter."" It also suffers from endless sci-fi terminology and exposition which stilt much of the dialogue and may bother and confuse some viewers. The climactic battle also falls somewhat flat and feels slightly rushed. It is truly unfortunate the way that 'John Carter' was handled. Many critics panned it and it infamously became the biggest box office flop in years, which is a shame, because it's actually rather good. It also pisses me off when people accuse it of being unoriginal; why? Because John Carter was the original; there would be no such thing as 'Star Wars', '2001: a Space Odyssey', 'Avatar' or 'Superman' if Burroughs hadn't decided to write about a man on Mars. Yes, its story may be a bit too classic or old-fashioned for some, but not for this viewer. I found it to be an epic spectacle of wonderful visuals, exciting action and real heart, a key ingredient missing from so many modern sci-fi movies. I know it's terribly unlikely, but I do hope that a sequel will be made, because I'd readily return to Barsoom any day.",John Carter
198,chickenjackson,A well done movie done dirty by poor Disney marketing,7,28 December 2017,"Before there was Avatar or even Superman, there was John Carter. This story is, literally, from 100 years ago by the writer of Tarzan and it took that long to get his vision to the big screen. Sadly, Disney really botched the marketing of this film...the original trailers make no sense and feel totally random and devoid of the center of the story. Just look at the main profile picture on this page for the poster of this film. It looks like a bad joke.Although other movies have taken from some of its thunder, overall, this is an entertaining and imaginative film with surprising heart, telling the story of a broken civil war vet who finds his way...in another world.",John Carter
199,changmoh,Highly Ambitious But Ultimately Disappointing,6,5 March 2012,"Every once in a while, we get a movie that makes everyone in the film industry sit up and take notice. This time around, it is ""John Carter"", Disney's US$250 million effort that has been causing one controversy after another - including rumours of costs overruns and poor marketing. At US$250, it is arguably one of the Top Five Most Expensive films to date (after ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End"", ""Tangled"", ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""). As a non-franchise film, it is sure testing the box-office waters with lots of fingers crossed. I will even call it Disney's biggest gamble of the year.After sitting through its media screening at the Sunway Pyramid TGV Imax cineplex in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, I am doubtful that it will be as hot a hit as the above-mentioned expensive blockbusters. It is likely to open with a big bang (probably over US$50 million at US box-office) before word-of-mouth takes it to the back-burner where it takes a longer time to recoup its costs. On the other hand, it may go the way of ""The Green Lantern"", last year's flop.Based on ""A Princess of Mars"", the first of Edgar Rice Burroughs' 11-volume Barsoom novels, this is the story of war-weary, former US Calvary captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) whose search for a cave of gold inexplicably transports him to Mars where he becomes embroiled in an epic conflict amongst the planet's inhabitants. Basically, there are main three 'races' involved in the Martian civil war - the greenish, four-handed and tusked giants called Tharks; the humanoid Zodangas, and the Roman-attired Heliumites.To complicate matters is a group of shape-changing beings called Therns who manipulate the war for their own ends. The Therns give Zodanga's ruler, Sab Than (Dominic West) a powerful weapon known as the Ninth Ray, forcing the Helium king Tardos Mors (Ciaran Hinds) to offer his daughter Dejah Thoris' (Lynn Collins) hand in marriage to the brutish Sab Than. Dejah, of course, is not keen on this marriage of convenience and she escapes and meets JC.Burroughs' John Carter tales pre-date those of Tarzan. Here, in this 'origin movie', Burroughs (played by Daryl Sabara) is shown as John Carter's nephew and heir who arrives at Carter's English mansion to sort out some matters. This device gives the narrative an extra dimension that should boost its credibility. However, as a fantasy film, credibility is the least of the its problems.The Barsoom (or Martian) sequences are visually spectacular (especially in IMAX 3D), reminding us of the exotic locales of Star Wars and even Avatar's Pandora. The six-limbed Tharks are a sight to behold although we can hardly differentiate the males from the females. However, these sequences are emotionally barren and un-involving. Who do we root for when the Martians battle one another in fancy winged air-ships? Director Andrew Stanton (who gave us ""WALL-E"" and ""Finding Nemo"") throws us into the swashbuckling action without prepping us with some plot build-up. But then, even the climactic battle is a blur of clashes because it is difficult to tell the Zodangas from the Heliumites.The plot about Barsoom's civil strife is familiar, outdated and overtaken by other sci-fi tales (especially so since Burroughs' novels are a hundred years old). The massive budget has allowed Stanton to put emphasis on the creatures and sets but the narrative has not been improved to make Burroughs adventure more cohesive. While some events on Barsoom appear complicated and confusing, others look derivative of ""Star Wars"" and ""Dune"". There are few attempts at humor - the most obvious is by Woola, the ugly-cute Martian dog that is JC's sidekick. It provides the few laughs in the movie and should be the favorite character of kids in the audience.The muscular Kitsch is energetic and handsome as the title hero known in Barsoom for his gravity-defying leaps. However, he lacks chemistry with Collins' Dejah Thoris and their romance seems implied and rushed. Collins, on the other hand, is solid as the feisty princess with both beauty and brains. She dominates the screen whenever she appears. Without its massive budget concern, ""John Carter"" would have been a passable sci-fi swashbuckler. With it, the off-cinema drama tends to be more interesting than the movie.",John Carter
200,gazzalodi,Not sure why this bombed,7,18 July 2020,"Taylor Kitsch as a confederate veteran, pretty good. Taylor Kitsch as a confederate veteran on Mars, not so much. But still I've seen more wooden actors in movies that won at the box office (Kristen Stewart).The film was a spectacular CGI fest. The story was pretty easy to follow. ""Help the pretty scantily clad girl,"" might not be a popular themes in the post me-too world but I'll always buy into it.If Disney would have marketed this right they we would probably be on the the third film of the franchise now.",John Carter
201,TroyeEvans,So Not-Avatar: Average Disney Feature,2,8 March 2012,"Just returned from a special screening and if not for the free tickets I would probably never have watched this. Now that I've sat through the entire movie (though I had the intention to leave near the end), I've confirmed my judgment.By no means can I call this a failure of Disney, partly on account of Disney's nature and partly because there aren't really obvious errors to speak of. ""John Carter"" presents itself as a feel-good movie, and somewhat it is, but everything is just not enough.Having sat through the first 30 minutes or so, the six-lettered word ""Avatar"" already surfaced, and I knew then that it was going to be hard to sit till the end. I couldn't help having a sense that the movie is trying to be the new ""Avatar"" (perhaps it's just me), a fact which I instantly realized was impossible, when I thought of the two names Disney and James Cameron, and made a little comparison (that didn't take long).""Avatar"" isn't my favorite kind of movie, but a part of me was truly stunned, at least by the visuals. I can't say the same for this Disney fantasy on Pandora (oh wait I forgot it's Mars). I have never been much of a critique of predictability, but I have to admit ""John Carter"" gives us an average fairy-tale-like childhood story of a prince and a princess. The short and apparently planned mention of humanity and wars is not about to save the sorrow of the script. I found it hard to sit through two whole hours, slight because of, I've got to admit, the fact that I knew what would happen, but more because I really dislike this kind of prince-saves-princess-and-marries-her story with seemingly effortless thinking. It is definitely not a story that loses the elements of organization and structure, but it is one that is all too familiar and certainly will not interest a wide array of viewers.And the visual effects, they are good, but not good enough. A dull desert setting with little beauty to witness really, and visually this is nothing compared to other fantasy movies like ""Avatar"" and ""Harry Potter"". Cinematography is far behind the standard in works like ""War Horse"". But I did survive through the IMAX 3D version of the movie, and I promise it doesn't lack action scenes. So if it's the intense fighting and chasing scenes you're looking for, you can still go for it.The pace of the movie seems moderate and reasonable, while the ending undoubtedly falls flat.If it's a fairytale and some action you're looking for, this is still an acceptable choice. But there really isn't much more to offer. And while I'm still wondering what the US box office of this will be (expect a sequel if it performs well), I'm praying that the next big thing from Disney will be better than this.",John Carter
202,heatsink98,One large messy movie,3,2 March 2013,"This movie goes wrong in so many ways that it would be difficult to condense the points in a single page. But here goes.The screenplay is so disconnected and logically inconsistent that it might seem a third-grader created it. I wonder, though, if anyone in the studio reviewed the work, or if the writers pantsed it in a single writing session and sent the screenplay out the door.Camera work in fight scenes gets confusing. Quick cuts try to establish who is doing what, but they don't work. For example, during the fight in the general store/bar a shot shows a hand grabbing a weapon, but only a hand and not the character attached to it. Later, in a fight on Mars a shot shows someone's leg with a chain that wraps around it, but just a leg.Compositing problems appear sporadically, with characters having black outlines around them. This was unexpected given the budget allocated for the film.Dialog is clunky. Lynn Collins had more awkward lines than anyone else; her character was intended to be stuffy, perhaps? Given what she had to work with, her performance was excellent. Taylor Kitsch, though, is uneven in spots, such as when he and the dog-monster are facing the impending horde in the desert.The final battle scene is just bad. Really bad. Dejah Thoris spends most of her time falling. Was that an overdone metaphor, with John Carter back to rescue her? Sab Than has John Carter on the ground and walks up to him, close enough he could stick John with his magic Thern sword, and stops to gloat in cliché bad-guy style.Other logical problems:Mars has around 40% of Earth's gravity. The writers have John Carter leaping 1000 ft. from a standing position, and falling from the same height with no damage. Apparently, even basic physics got tossed here.John Carter has supposedly increased strength. In one scene he kills a Thark with one punch, and Tars (the chief Thark) notes this, and does nothing about it. Other Tharks in that scene dog-pile John, and he can't seem to fight them off, his strength mysteriously gone.Tars makes it clear that John's jumping ability is impressive. Maybe as a novelty in the Thark circus, perhaps? Thark society valued strength and combat ability, which is acknowledged finally at one point. The jumping is underscored more often though, which is strange and contrived.The Thern's leader Matai Shang explains to John that they are eternal, but then mentions they feed from dying planets. What aspect of dying planets sustained them was not explained, was it the chaos, emotions of the inhabitants, or something else?The overall evil plan in the movie was to have Dejah Thoris marry Sab Than, and then Sab Than would kill her at the ceremony. This plot's intended outcome was the demoralization of Helium; presumably the inhabitants would up and surrender. I would expect the opposite to happen, where an angry father and populace strike back even harder than before.The Zodanga army parks itself outside Helium's gates, and waits for the signal during the wedding to attack. Helium is situated in a desert landscape, like the rest of Mars. Is the army invisible? There are no trees or cover to hide beneath.The Therns have a blue death ray, which they give to Sab Than, that can wipe out any opposition. Instead of using the weapon to destroy anybody that gets in their way, they ask Sab Than to coerce Helium leadership into the convoluted wedding. Again, no coherent plot here. What the chaos of the wedding has to do with the Thern feeding mechanism is not explained. If the goal was to wipe out the inhabitants of Helium, why not just use the death ray?It is made clear that Tharks do not fly. Yet the final battle scene involves Tharks flying in on stolen ships from Zodanga. Are Tharks secretly disgruntled pilots?The flying ships have what appear to be solar panels, and require sunlight to operate. The Tharks steal ships and fly them at night to Helium somehow.John Carter constructs a crypt for his faked death, with a door that opens from the inside. Matai Shang teleports in one part of the movie, so a locked door would not stop him.",John Carter
203,slayerjmk95,The Original Sci-fi Epic Adventure,9,25 March 2012,"For those of you who do not know, John Carter of Mars first came to be in the story Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote in 1912 called ""A Princess of Mars,"" which is the inspiration of the sci-fi movies of James Cameron's Avatar, George Lucas' Star Wars and Flash Gordon, and countless others. There are many things in this film that you can tie all those to, but only because this is the ORIGINAL sci-fi adventure, and the best one. John Carter, a civil war veteran, is accidentally transported to Mars after a run-in with a Martian and must now help a princess stop two warring civilizations from destroying each other and save the dying planet.This film, in every possible way, is just absolutely incredible. It may not be an original film, but it is, once again, the original story. Taylor Kitsch is phenomenal as Carter, a man with a dark and sad past who must choose whether or not to help these ""alien"" peoples. Lynn Collins was absolutely stunning and beyond beautiful as Dejah Thoris, a Red Martian of Helium. Willem Dafoe was incredible and believable as Tars Tarkas, a Thark; an fifteen-foot tall, four-armed green Martian. The setting was just breathtaking in the way that it truly takes you to a different world; you don't feel like you're watching a movie, but you're experiencing the real adventure. The music, by Michael Giacchino, was a mixture of John Williams and Hans Zimmer; memorable and epic. Andrew Stanton really knew what he was doing when he directed this film, as it lives up to the name Burroughs hoped it would. Don't be swayed by the critics; this is a movie that needs to be seen, and look at it as if it were the original if you want the full experience. The story always captivated me, as i read it when i was six, and to see it on the big screen was beyond a dream-come-true. There truly has to be a sequel, and i hope to God that it's made; Thank You Andrew Stanton.9.5/10 Stars***",John Carter
204,roystephen-81252,'The best Star Wars since Avatar',10,10 February 2016,"In today's culture there's no place for fairy-tales. There's no place for simple but highly imaginative stories with a clear moral message. There's no respect for visionaries, no credit given to those who created fully-blown worlds out of nothing. Everything has to be 'dark', 'gritty', 'real' and morally ambiguous, even dubious. Or simply loud and dumb. There's no place for movies that embody the very thing cinema was invented for: the magical power of limitless imagination.From George Lucas's wonderful creations to Avatar, from very original tales like The Golden Compass or Stardust to John Carter, movies that do not fit in today's bitter world are bashed endlessly, or outright bomb at the box office, as John Carter did. However, if you, like me, refuse to bow to this lack of imagination, and liked the aforementioned movies, then you'll probably fall in love with John Carter, too. It is truly amazing. As my friend put it, 'It's the best Star Wars since Avatar'.(Note: I admit, I haven't read Edgar Rice Borroughs' Mars-series, but as far as I know, fans of the novels were pleased with the movie adaptation, as well.)",John Carter

There was a lot to explain, sometimes it's a good thing, but it seemed just a little overcrowded. It's somewhat distracting at points, but it has it's fair share of pay offs for the things they explain. John Carter is still a thought-provoking movie with enough funny and entertaining moments through out. It's very original too, which gives me more to like.",John Carter
206,dinalt10,An excellent film,8,7 October 2012,"Really, Disney dropped the ball big time on this one - their lacklustre trailers actually put me off seeing this film on the big screen.I only got round to watching it, as it was reduced at my local store on DVD, so I figured I'd give it a watch.And the film is amazing - beautiful representations of Mars, great sets and a script that doesn't take itself too seriously - but lets you enjoy what's going on.Disneys marketing department should be ashamed of themselves. This is a film that could have been one of their major hits - and they seemed to trash it with their own campaign.It's not cerebral Sci-Fi, but nor is it meant to be. It's pure escapism during the length of the film, and leaves you wanting more.............for a long film, it actually feels short.",John Carter

208,theycallmemrglass,"Cheesy, ludicrous plot but highly enjoyable blockbuster Sci-fi fantasy adventure",8,3 March 2012,"I saw this at a preview screening in London.I never read any of the books so only had a vague synopsis of the story just from trailers which didn't really impress me much. Well, this turned out to be quite a blast. Its an enjoyable if very cheesy Sci-fi fantasy blockbuster. It has the spirit and energy of Flash Gordon including its own outrageously nonsensical but fun premise. It isn't as cheesy as that film but there is a definite lean towards it. The story is quite a novel mix of Planet of the Apes, Conan, Red Sonja, Avatar, Star Wars and Superman (yep this is a superhero movie too). We even have a western thrown in the mix at the beginning. I was going to say there isn't anything original here but how can I? This story was published in the 19th century so from that perspective, I can now see a lot of plot influences deriving from this in later SF/fantasy films.A lot of money was spent on this movie and it shows. The special effects here are pretty awesome. Not necessarily ground breaking, everything on screen has been done before but its all smoothly done at a grand scale though not quite to the scale of the Star Wars prequels. Effects that stood out for me were John Carters ""Hulk"" like jumps, Martian sky ship battles, green martians (as good as Avatar), and a cute monster dog sidekick that almost steels the show.Another major feature of the film was the cinematography. Its quite spectacular and for a barren dead desert planet, its surprisingly stunning.One of the biggest surprise for me was the 3D. Its post conversion which most often results in poorer quality than films which are filmed in 3D from the start. But an exception can be made here. This is hands down the best 3d conversion film I have seen. The 3d depth was outstanding and really shows its power in numerous landscape and action scenes. This is probably the second best 3d live action film I've seen overall (either filmed in 3d or post converted) and I am normally anti-3d when it comes to live action films. Taylor Kitsch who plays John Carter has just about enough screen presence portraying a likable anti hero with a punchy attitude and a sense of past history haunting him. Its a Han Solo type role but he plays it more brooding. There is even a Princess Leia and the age old storyline of helping a Princess to fight a war but each with their own agendas. Its all very clichéd, yet still enjoyable. As much fun as I had with this, there is no denying that there is a lot wrong with it too. I could pick on flaws and lack of logic all day long with this film some of which are smack on the head stupid and some elements I desperately wished more or better development on. The dialogue while often funny, also often dive bombs into cringe-worthiness (much like a Lucas script), the developing romance was very disjointed and sometimes embarrassing (think Anakin and Padme levels of embarrassment). The 3 way war politics was not very clear, major characters not fleshed out enough and there's a whole lot of story loopholes. Yet there is still a lot more fun to be had to override those flaws. I have a feeling that book lovers will be disappointed because I can detect a lot of back story is missing here and key characters seem very short changed on their development and motives (particularly with the green martians) which I am sure would have been fully fleshed out in the book. However, I reckon if you enjoy films like Thor and GI Joe, you'll have a great time with this. This wont be a classic or even a cult movie but it is a satisfying piece of cinema escapism. And its enough for me to want to read the books!",John Carter

I have not read any of the stories so I am unsure how closely it sticks to the book, however I like to think of a movie from a book as being two different things that way I get to enjoy them both as stand alone and separate things.I thought the graphics were really cool and quite realistic. I didn't get to see it in 3D which is a pity as I think that would have been even better.I love the way there are 3 stories woven together and they hold together pretty well.

Let alone the author of Greystone a.k.a. Tarzan, Edgar Rice Buroughs.Sure it looked great and that was the only good part about it.The movie was very disjointed, too much time was spent on the semantics of the two martian factions fighting and John Carter some how being not only to comprehend an alien language but also being able to seemingly have the ability to fight one of the factions and the knowledge to use alien equipment.I Have seen the other reviews and liking the movie to Avatar. This movie is NO AVATAR. I own Avatar in both Blu-Ray and Regular so I can watch it in two locations. I also watched Avatar in the theater three times. One of those times was in an IMAX 3D theater.I commented to the person I was with how bad John Carter was and is.Marketing wasn't the problem, it was the main character, John Carter. Most did not know who John Carter was, nor did they care or have a vested interest in him such as Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and all those characters from Star Wars movies.The ending doesn't make sense either, John Carter comes back to earth and his body is alive but the other there had died.

It really goes to show what movies you like and don't like is all down to personal tastes and preferences; no critic can tell you that. While most of the known world hated John Carter, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found it to be entertaining and pretty smart in parts. I can see if people know the story and have read the books, there may be things in the movie that will irk them and rub the wrong way. I've never read the books and neither do I know any of the back story; so maybe that helped my enjoyment of the movie. I'm not usually a fan of Taylor Kitsch, but I felt the role of John Carter fitted him; a good mix of reluctance and honour. Lynn Collins is sexy as hell as the martian princess, Mark Strong is suitably creepy and slippery as a Thern villain. The aliens and creatures are imaginative and fun, especially Woola the loyal dog-like pet that can run really really fast. All in all, keep your expectations lower than usual and you'll get a lot of fun out of this.",John Carter

I can't understand all the bad press and unfavorable reviews. After all, it's a Hollywood sci-fi movie. All that said, I found the Western style intro to be a little too long. Portions too closely resembled the StarWars universe.

214,CarmaChan,Applause from Tarzana,7,2 July 2012,"I finally saw John Carter on DVD (thanks Blockbuster @Home and DishTV for the promotional deal!) It surprised me. I did not expect to like it as much as I did. I live in Tarzana - a pretty little city northwest of Los Angeles founded by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the writer best known for his creation of the jungle hero Tarzan. The trailers for this movie did not make me want to shell out 13 bucks for a cinematic experience, I could wait for the DVD. In fact, the trailers did not make me want to see it at all. The only reason I put it at the top of my DVD queue is that my sweetheart had totally enjoyed it and did not understand what all the hating was about. My only knowledge of the story came through him - he is a comic book geek and knows all the who's who and background stuff, and he told me that ""John Carter"" was written by the guy who created Tarzan and Tarzana. He told me that Disney had played with the title ""John Carter of Mars"", but dropped the idea and rumor was that it was because ""Mars Needs Moms"" had not done well, so there was speculation the Mars is jinxed. (Hollywood people can be so superstitious! Maybe Mars Needs Moms lacked some other quality? Don't blame it on the audience or a word!)To the point - my honeybear kept on me about John Carter, so I got the DVD in the mail last Saturday and we watched it, and I have to say, I really did like it, and more importantly, I respect it! It was a solid adaptation, and a very difficult one. When a story goes all over the map like that, and has non-linear timing, it can be hard to follow, but I had no trouble at all and loved the way they foreshadowed, and everything about the movie, really. Well done, Disney! Applause to the entire crew, and thank you for bringing this great original story to the world. Congratulations to Edgar - rock on, bro!~The Saardu Lady~",John Carter

It is an absolutely outstanding piece of entertainment, and I believe in 20 years it will be viewed as an important piece of sci-fi that was completely overlooked. It saddens me for the cast and crew who obviously put 110% of their effort into making this film.The movie does have a familiar feel to it, and that feel is the one that I got viewing the original 3 Star Wars movies, with some Indiana Jones and Avatar thrown in. I haven't enjoyed a film this much since ""Inception"". Yes, it is that good. It is action-packed, but not action-for-the-sake-of-action. Sure, it doesn't explain things neatly like ""Star Trek""; it is much more oriented toward ""Star Wars"" type of fiction.

219,Gin-ster,The pits - bad story-writing,4,2 July 2012,"I was a great fan of the John Carter series when I was a kid, but I tried to put that aside as I watched the film; if it wasn't faithful to the book or setting (which it wasn't), that was not a problem for me. However, as a piece of film-making this was an absolute dud. It opened with a bang, then detoured into some dull plot points about Carter and his tomb and his personal quest before getting back to Mars. While the movie had the requisite sword fighting against impossible odds, with Carter and Tars Tarkas taking on countless foes at once (true to the novels by the way) the film version had to Hollywoodize (i.e. sentimentalize) it by letting us know that while Carter was doing his hacking and chopping, he was thinking of the vengefulness he felt for Northern armies that had killed his wife. But this was only a minor problem. The main thing was the transition between ""rousing"" action and thudding plot explication, so that periodically everything ground to a halt, and on a related note, the general lack of creating characters whose fate one could care about. The subplot about Edgar Rice Burroughs was just plain stupid, in my humble opinion - bad story-writing.Some reviewers have pointed out that it is ridiculous for cultures which have air travel and super-weapons to resort to sword fighting, and that is true - and here it was a glaring problem. I'm glad, though, that I hadn't thought of that when I read the novels in my teens.:)",John Carter
220,andershenningsen,"Well, pretty OK movie",4,20 September 2018,"The story is clear, the characters are easy to remember and are quite well performed by the actors...But, it is not the most ""Wooow"" sci-fi movie ever. There are some things that do not always coincide, but, it's a pretty good movie if you just want some action, humor and romance from a sci-fi movie",John Carter
221,jimwaldothefirst,Hoping for a sequal or more...,10,16 March 2021,"I've pretty much given this the same review as Velarian. I have watched this move ridiculous amount of times. People give it mixed reviews, I think a lot even boycoted it and hated on it because it was Disney, you love it or hate it. Cgi, environments compositions, cinematography just amazing. Good story, good cast, good movie!!!The only down side, its whole universe that is crammed into one movie, it does a good job of this, however, it could easily have been expanded to show more of multitude of species and atmospheres on show.I will watch this more times than I already have!",John Carter
222,uroshnor54,Pretty Good,7,8 April 2014,"I'll be honest, when I first saw a trailer for JOHN CARTER, I thought it looked dumb. It was the trailer with Led Zeppelin's Kashmir. But then I saw the trailer with Peter Gabriel's cover of My Body is a Cage and I thought it looked alright. I saw JOHN CARTER and I thought it was actually pretty good. I liked it more than AVATAR, definitely. By the way, I cannot believe how many people here are saying that JOHN CARTER is a ripoff of AVATAR. A PRINCESS OF MARS, the book on which JOHN CARTER is based, was published in 1912. That's James Cameron said that he wanted to make AVATAR after he was done with TITANIC (but didn't because the technology to make it would have been too expensive at the time), if I remember right. TITANIC was released in 1997. That's 85 years. I can't believe that people can't do just a little bit of research when we have the Internet. It would literally take lesst than two minutes to use Google to see if a movie is based on a book.Anyway, I thought it was good but not great. I mean the action scenes were pretty entertaining but there weren't enough of them. And I thought Taylor Kitsch was okay as the main character but I didn't like how he speaks every line with a kind of forced and unnatural hoarseness. Lynn Collins was beautiful but why did she have to have a really fake- sounding British accent? Was she trying to imitate Carrie Fisher? But Carrie Fisher kind of had a reason. She was studying in Britain and just happened to pick up the accent.I also didn't think the motivations of the Therns were explained well and it didn't really make much sense how they could be immortal but not bulletproof.Still, the villains, Tal Hajus, Sab Than, and Sarkoja, were good. Sure, real life is rarely black and white but I really like it when a movie gives you a villain you can have absolutely no sympathy for. I kind of wanted to see a long sword fight between John Carter and Tal Hajus but it was kind of cool when Carter just slices off Tal Hajus's head. I don't think you can blame Andrew Stanton and the writers for much of the problems of the movie. I read A PRINCESS OF MARS and I honestly didn't like it much. I have to say I thought the movie was actually better. It's more pulpy and fun than the book.",John Carter
223,John K.-2,"Good action, decent story. See this if you liked Star Wars episode 1",8,9 March 2012,"I don't get out to the cinema much these days, and when I do I often pick the sci-fi films. This one turned out much better than some sci-fis, and much better than I expected, perhaps because the hero's ""super-powers"" come from an entirely logical source; you or I too could have super-powers in an identical situation. The situations that he encounters are reminiscent of Star Wars episode 1 (there are even characters who resemble Jar Jar Binks, though they're much less annoying - they're a nice mix of brutal and humorous), plus they threw in a gorgeous and definitely-not-helpless princess from Episode 4. Though come to think of it, this story was published 50 years before Star Wars, so maybe the copying was the other way round ... Anyway, if you feel like watching a hero/princess story with 1800s technology and with plenty of action and side-plots, go see this.",John Carter
224,socialmedia-437-956449,"Promising, but....",5,2 August 2012,"Hollywood's blockbuster machine was stirring into life after a quiet winter. ""John Carter"" serves as an appetizer for the main banquet of 2012, which includes ""The Avengers"", ""The Amazing Spiderman"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"". And Disney has spared no expense on its latest 3D epic – giving director Andrew Stanton (""Wall-E"", ""Finding Nemo"") a reported budget of $250 million to play with; creating a brand-new franchise from one of science-fiction oldest properties. Introduced to readers of pulp-fiction literature in 1912, ""John Carter"" set the template for a whole century's worth of sci-fi cinema. Many of our favorite movies, including ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" have borrowed heavily from Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""John Carter"" novels. So if this new movie feels a little second-hand, you know why.Our hero John Carter (played by rising star Taylor Kitsch, soon to be seen in ""Battleship"") is a rebellious confederate soldier from America's Old West. He is quickly established as a fearless hero, constantly escaping capture and outwitting his enemies. Following a thrilling prison-break, Carter stumbles upon an ancient alien star-portal, and is transported to the savage battlefields of Mars and straight into the middle of a civil war. As in ""Avatar"", Carter's adventure begins when he collides with alien natives – the Tharks (led by a gravel voiced Willem Dafoe, in computerized form), whose civilization is on the brink of destruction by sinister forces. These initial scenes on Mars (or Barsoom as its residents call it) are great fun, with our hero learning how to deal with a change in gravity and attempting to outwit the pursuing Tharks.After a frosty start, the Tharks realize John Carter is actually quite a good guy to have around – handy with a sword, tasty in a fight, and able to jump great distances without the use of a trampoline. Elsewhere on Mars, two warring tribes – the Zodangans (led by Dominic West) and the Heliumites, led by Ciaran Hinds – battle for supremacy. One thing we must accept when watching a sci-fi or fantasy film is the mandatory use of silly names. There's nothing we can do about that.As with all great myths, there's also a beautiful Princess for our hero to fall in love with – the intrepid Dejah Toris, played with muscular elegance by Lynn Collins (""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"").To make things even more complicated, a shadowy puppet master called Matai Shang (Mark Strong) is generally causing a lot of bother in his attempts to drain the planet of energy.Are we lost yet? Despite sounding overly complicated, ""John Carter"" actually cracks along with real pace and energy, and features some exhilarating battle sequences. Unfortunately we have to wait for the really good stuff for almost an hour, while the story is set up, which may lose many younger viewers (and those with short attention spans and busy Blackberries). I was also left slightly underwhelmed by the overall production design, which seemed to borrow ""Stargate"", ""Return of the Jedi"" and ""Cowboys & Aliens"".My next complaint may not be entirely the fault of the filmmakers. A common gripe of the 3D experience is a noticeable darkness of image, caused by cinemas using projector bulbs that aren't nearly bright enough to compensate for the 3D glasses. This was painfully true for the screening I attended, where often felt I was squinting at the film through a heavy fog.Despite my reservations, I came away from ""John Carter"" without the sense of disappointment I felt so strongly with last year's box-office flops ""Sucker Punch"", and ""Green Lantern"", all of which represent the filmic equivalent of a McDonald's Happy Meal.It's just a pity we've seen it all before, despite ""John Carter"" being the original tale that gave ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" their life-force. There is a lot to enjoy, and if it wasn't for the poor 3D presentation, I think I might have been swept away.Find the rest of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education, at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com, and follow us on Twitter @DohaFilm.",John Carter
225,markdroulston,Unfortunate familiarity,5,8 March 2012,"It's hard to believe, but it's that time again. Blockbuster season. The increasingly lengthy part of the year when Hollywood studios throw the vast majority of their budgets at a handful of tent-pole releases, competing for audience dollars in a barrage of explosive effects, unimportant and underdeveloped plots, and the ever present corporate sponsorship deals. It's a risky time for Hollywood; a successful blockbuster can develop into a cash-cow franchise for years to come, whereas a failure can dangerously cripple even the most powerful studios. In 2012, Disney gets us underway with JOHN CARTER, a project stuck in production limbo for decades, finally realised by Pixar director Andrew Stanton (WALL-E, FINDING NEMO) making his live-action debut. Getting out of the gate early to avoid any potential competition is a clever move by Disney, yet it's hard to imagine that JOHN CARTER will come close to the kind of box-office revenues needed to consider it a financial success. It's not a bad film; in fact there is much to be admired about Stanton's work on a difficult property, but it exists in an uncomfortable middle-ground of being perhaps too dense and metaphorical for mainstream audiences whilst probably too generic and clichéd to impress hardcore sci-fi/fantasy fans.What impresses most about JOHN CARTER is how, for the most part, Stanton is allowed to run free with the strangeness of the world in which the film is set. There are moments of pure brilliance, both visually and thematically, where the movie that Stanton so obviously wants to make are allowed to shine through, recalling the majesty of the opening act of his previous film WALL-E. The film doesn't hold your hand and get bogged down with excessive exposition, but rather trusts that audiences are familiar enough with the sci-fi genre that not everything needs to be spelled out. Disney have to be commended for taking an unexpected gamble and refusing to simplify much of the more complicated areas of the story, but unfortunately it's probably a gamble that will not pay dividends. There are moments where the plot is perhaps a little too obtuse, and the hard sci-fi conventions don't blend well with a dull, immaterial romantic sub-plot that sees the emotional core of the film come off as a little hollow. Another brave move was in the casting of an unproven, if not entirely unknown lead actor in Taylor Kitsch, who growls his way through the dialogue in a satisfactory but unfortunately uncharismatic manner.Sadly, where JOHN CARTER is going to suffer most is in its familiar and unoriginal storyline. Edgar Rice Burroughs' BARSOOM series of novels are something of a Rosetta Stone to the sci-fi/fantasy genre, stretching back a century to A PRINCESS OF MARS, the novel on which Stanton's film takes the majority of its plot. Being such a beloved and influential series works against Disney however, as Burroughs' novels have been imitated, borrowed from, and essentially plucked clean by almost every other film in the genre. Now, when JOHN CARTER arguably should be respected for being a true original, instead what results is a stylistically and thematically dusty work. Had JOHN CARTER been made 40 years ago, before STAR WARS, AVATAR, and any number of similar films, it would have undoubtedly been a smash, but as it is today, it's difficult to view it as much more than the same hackneyed story we've seen before. It's a shame that Burroughs importance to the genre will be completely over the head of most audiences, but a little more outside-the-box thinking from Stanton and Disney may have been able to salvage the film and introduce a new generation to his work. JOHN CARTER is not going to break Disney, yet the almost inevitably disappointing box-office is certainly going to hurt. It's a fascinating start to the season, and for better or worse JOHN CARTER will almost certainly go down as the riskiest prospect on the blockbuster calendar.tinribs27.wordpress.com",John Carter
226,bigcalkenobi,John Carter is certainly an entertaining film and at times did manage to convince me that it was even more than that,7,13 March 2012,"In a world where every space science-fiction movie seems to be inspired by either Star Wars or Star Trek, it is interesting to see a film that is not only cut from a different cloth, but interestingly enough inspired the former films mentioned. The Barsoom series(John Carter book series) is not a household brand, but is actually a historically influential piece of sci-fi literature written by Edgar Rice Burroughs (Tarzan) in the early 20th century. The series has had a huge impact on not only science fiction, but also films in general as both George Lucas and James Cameron have both stated that the stories of John Carter had a significant influence on both Star Wars and Avatar respectively. These movies have not only changed(for better or worse) the way that movies are conceptualized, made, and sold in the last 40 years, but they have also inspired multiple generations of film makers and film goers. Why does this little history lesson matter? It's important because John Carter has the unique opportunity(or challenge) to both see how well it holds up after being written 100 years ago and also an opportunity to see how much or how little its spiritual successors have surpassed it. Another thing to consider about this film is that it is being made by Disney, a company that has generally shied away from live action science fiction.

I'll be honest, the Edgar Rice Burroughs Martian Tales are my favourite books. Unfortunately this abomination takes character names and creature/world descriptions and essentially leaves it there.The core of the story is John Carter himself, but beyond his name the movie version is a huge insult to the original. John Carter was a warrior, a hero in the truest sense. He would do the right thing because it was the right thing. He wouldn't have to be coerced whilst wallowing in self-pity, like the pathetic 'hero' in this film.Beyond that, the story is butchered beyond belief, along with the other characters. Some praise can be given to the visuals and production design, but beyond that... Please, _please_ don't judge the books based on this film. Go and read them, and be amazed at how fresh and exciting they are. They're true classic adventures with great heroes, beautiful princesses, hideous and cruel villains, and more imagination and action than you can throw a stick at! And they have inspired many of the most successful movies and books that came after them.Hopefully this disaster will be forgotten so that someone can eventually make a good and true adaptation.

229,SerpentMage,So as expected I liked the movie...,10,14 July 2012,"When I read the reviews I thought, something is not right here. Regardless I was going to buy the DVD. I have to say that I really liked it. My wife who is not a film nut like myself said, ""people hated this movie?"" She thought it was quite nice to watch.First off do I hate anything? Not really... Does this movie tread new territory? It depends on what you movie background is. When I watched this movie what kept going through my mind was Dune. Back then many critiqued Dune for the exact same things they are critiquing John Carter. The comparison to other movies like Superman is not correct. Though there is a connection to Avatar.The dune tag line on IMDb; ""In the distant future, a man appears who may be the prophet that a long-suffering galaxy has been waiting for."" If you compare that to John Carter you pretty well get the story that is about to evolve. The story has other twists and corners that make it distinct from Dune, but the grand SciFi Fantasy storyline like in Dune is very much intact.If there is any critique of this movie it is that it is too short. John Carter with its 2 hours is short when compared to Avatar's 2 hours 30 minutes, and Lord of the Rings 3 hours. I think if they had added that extra half hour then all of the corners would have been tucked in very nicely.The good part about this movie is that it is very watchable and there are not any parts where you think, ""ok now I am a bit bored"". The pace is very easy to follow, but not being entirely predictable. There are many little twists and turns without them being too obvious. I also appreciated the lack of Star Trek moments. A Star Trek moment is when writers come up with a magic technology to help them out of a dead end in the storyline. For a SciFi/Fantasy that is hard to do effectively.Overall a good movie to watch.",John Carter

This story of a human who by accident ends up on Mars - a living Mars full of alien beings - is told in the manner of Baron Münchhausen and is equally unbelievable.Bipedal sentient aliens and other creatures are as beautifully rendered as any you have ever seen. The action typically feels like Prince of Persia fight scenes set on a Star Wars speeder chase. Sure - it's all cheesy and clichéd, but also wonderfully entertaining.There is nothing here in the way of character development or depth, but the ride is fun even without it.

All we really knew is we didn't want to go home so we decided to see a movie. John Carter was playing in IMAX so we decided to give it a try. WOW! We were completely amazed! I really thought his would just be another run-of-the-mill special effects movie with lots of action and little storyline. This movie was the complete package! From what I have read it does differ from the original story a lot but thats typical when the original is si-fi from 100 years ago. Im not upset that this has been given such bad reviews because that usually a good set-up for a cult classic. Seeing how the original story was si-fi pulp fiction, it seems appropriate. Don't feel that this movie has to be watched on the big screen or IMAX as the storyline is good enough to make it a good watch on any size TV. A perfect sleeper for the summer in case you missed it!! For all you morons who say its a rip-off of Avitar you really need to do your homework.

Now after seeing the movie, I am sorry Disney didn't think their promotion of John Carter more thoroughly. Not that Disney didn't put enough money into their promotion, they did. However, if your title is a dog, well then, you know the axiom about betting on dogs. Again, John Carter was a adaption of a 1917 novel titled, Princess of Mars. The Princess, beautifully played by Lynn Collins (those eyes, contacts?)would have been better served in the title of this movie, as was a movie named after the title of the book released as a video in 2009. I really think the title of the book being in the title or replacing the title John Carter would have helped this movie at the box office.(perhaps, John Carter and the Princess of Mars) You know, hindsight is better than foresight.The movie is visually appealing, well paced (especially for an action adventure) and nicely edited.

I should have realized that nothing could be as bad as those reviews! Really, this movie is quite good - certainly better than the dreadful Avatar, to which it's sometimes compared.When I think of all the rattletrap thoughtless pieces of junk that DO make money (I'm looking at YOU, Transformers, GI Joe, Clash of the Titans, etc.)I cannot see why this one failed. I can't speak to its fidelity to Princess of Mars, since I didn't read that one, but I found the plot serviceable and even unexpectedly moving for a Disney sci-fi extravaganza. John Carter's initial damaged mental state adds a dimension some of these other movies lack. Taylor Kitsch seems committed to the role, and is quite good. The home scenes cut with battle scenes on Mars were effective and sad.

It most certainly ""Is NOT a Failure"" yes perhaps in Box Office Terms but that's all.It is a Beautifully made Movie.Based on the Book ""A Princess of Mars"" Disney went the PG route again as they did with ""The Rocketeer"" (it would be nice to see Disney go the adult route as in the books once in awhile but I guess family films make more money) So this put a little doubt in my mind straight away, even though ""The Rocketeer"" turned out to be a brilliant under-rated gem of an action adventure film which was also given a PG Rating.Disney then in it's wisdom decided to drop the name ""John Carter of Mars"" for whatever reason (although they cleverly kept the logo in some of the advertising material and in the film itself JCM) Leaving the very basic & boring ""John Carter""!!! THIS WAS A MASSIVE MISTAKE by DisneyFinally the Advertising Campaign from Disney seemed half hearted at the time of it's release & it certainly didn't draw me into the cinema.Now Forget All This...and just go and watch this Sci-Fi/Fantasy Gem!!!A MOVIE THAT WILL BE APPRECIATED (I hope) MORE IN THE FUTURE.If you want comparisons then it's a SUPER mix of Star Wars, Flash Gordon, The Martian Chronicles with a touch of Riddick & The Time Machine for good measure whilst still having a great deal of originality to it.A Wonderfully Visual & Stunning Film Directed with Great Style by Mr Stanton...who I hope will be given another Big Chance.I caught up with this on 3D Blu-Ray & can whole heartily recommend the 3D for this film (If you have the Set-Up)The big surprise was the lead (Taylor Kitsch) whom I had seen earlier in ""Battleship"" (a fun, brash, loud, silly film but entertaining nevertheless) in which I found him to be a little wooden if i'm being honest, so I wasn't expecting him to be quiet as good as he was here as John Carter.And then we come to the Princess...LYNN COLLINS...My God she is BREATHLESSLY BEAUTIFUL and could well have become the new Princess Leia had this Film had the success it should have seen.I won't go into too many more details of this film, just watch it & then rate it as high as you can & perhaps, just perhaps Disney might Green Light a Sequel to it.Well Done Mr Stanton...If nothing else you've made perhaps one of the Best 'Cult' Movies of all time (which is sad in some respects as only a small selection of people will appreciate it)RocketeerFlyer Rating of 10/10",John Carter
236,SoulfulFX,John Carter of Mars,8,9 March 2012,"This was a pretty entertaining sci-fi movie. The plot is rushed at some points, but I guess readers of what this is originally based on probably understood the gaps. As someone who never read the ""Princess of Mars,"" I still found the plot easy to follow and actually fairly well paced for a 2 hour runtime. The action sequences are nicely done and except for the CG aliens, the special effects are not intrusive.I would have liked more time to explore the role of the highly-advanced aliens responsible for the inter-world travel system...but otherwise, I felt generally satisfied with the story.I saw one review or two say this was ""Avatar-lite"" but I disagree somewhat. The earth-man rescuing the alien civilization part fits that description, but ""Avatar"" was almost blow-for-blow the same as the Pocahontas story...

Well, did it live up to my expectations? Yes ... and no...John Carter is about a man (named John Carter, duh) who finds this alien inside a cave, which transports him to the planet of Mars. On this planet, he finds out that he has extraordinary abilities that just might help him to survive the planet's cruelty. On Mars, there are these three alien races that are fighting in a war, and John Carter needs to end this war, or else the war might spread over to his own planet Earth.I enjoyed the first half of this movie, as it really reminded me of a Pixar movie, which does make sense since it's directed by a guy from Pixar. The green aliens were really funny and there's also this dog alien that runs extremely fast, which was definitely the best character in the film. But after that first half, the movie went over from an entertaining family film to a boring CGI fantasy/sci-fi war film. The battle scenes near the end will make you yawn, and the whole romance thing between John Carter and the Princess from Mars will not grab you what-so-ever.A lot of this movie will remind you of the first two Star Wars prequels, and even sometimes they reference the original films. There's this arena scene that's obviously inspired by the arena scene from Attack of the Clones, and the space ships also look like they belong in Star Wars. There's even a reference to the Rancor Pit from Return of the Jedi. I personally enjoyed these references.Overall, John Carter is an OK film. The first half is great, but the second half is pretty forgettable. If you're gonna see this film, you don't need to see it in theaters. Wait 'til it comes out on DVD and Blu-Ray or something. The 3D also isn't that special, so there you go...",John Carter
238,cujoe_da_man,Ping Pong rules in effect.,8,3 June 2020,"Finally got to see this in its entirety and glad I did. I agree with everyone else that this didn't get the proper marketing it needed, I barely even remember it coming out, but I do remember critics reaming it for being a terrible movie... which it isn't.There are two big black eyes on this movie, though. I'm usually able to suspend disbelief for pseudo-science and random technobabble, but there are just some things I can't look beyond. The first problem I have is with the teleporter, the idea that he's not actually transported to Mars, rather he's ""copied"" to Mars. There are literally now two John Carter's, one on Earth and one on Mars. I don't get this idea because (as he states), if he dies on Earth, he dies on Mars. So, how does he eat and keep his body from dying (naturally) while he's away? Does he have to come back every day to gain sustenance? Does that mean he's immortal on Mars? If his real body is on Earth, that means he could possibly ""die"" on Mars and then just return to Mars again. It's too much like ""The Matrix"" to not ask questions.The other issue I have is with his strength. I know that when you go to a planet smaller than Earth that you are ""stronger"", though in reality it's just less gravity and you muscles have to work less, but for him to suddenly develop Superman levels of strength and speed is really asking waaaay too much. Men going to the moon should have never had to bring a rover with them because they could have jumped halfway around the moon in a single bound if we're following this logic. Yet, I just go with it because I figure it must have something to do with him being a copy of himself.I didn't let those two points ruin the film for me, every film will have issues like that, but those two really stand out... well, aside from the idea that entire civilizations will never be seen from Earth with powerful telescopes, satellites and robot rovers, buuut maybe we just haven't zoomed on those parts of the planet close enough.BUT! I still enjoyed it even with some of the strange technical things, it had some humor and heart and I really enjoyed Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris, she really looks great with tattoos and dark skin.",John Carter
239,Zen416,Better than the critics suggest,8,13 March 2012,"I loved the Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars series books so seeing this movie was a must. I'm glad I did, despite some of the critical negativity out there. It's a scifi movie in the more traditional sense, with the old fashioned tale of a hero rescuing an exotic princess from the villain. Traditional tale aside, the special effects were outstanding, and while the film varies from the original book in many areas, it's not bad at all. In fact, the changes add even more excitement to this tale of a wandering, disheartened civil war vet who finds himself transported to the red planet; they help flesh out several of the main characters in a way that helps those who haven't read the books understand who's who and what's what.Taylor Kitsch is well cast as the titular John Carter and he plays him with a whole lot of depth and a bit of humor, showcasing his acting ability in a way that he couldn't on the TV show Friday Night Lights. Kitsch strikes me a talent that's going to stick around for awhile and grow into even bigger leading man roles. Good for him. Mark Strong is really making a name for himself playing the dark roles , like Matai Shang here, the mysterious and nefarious ancient Barsoomian changeling with questionable morals. He's so good at being bad that it's no wonder so many films cast him in nice, meaty, villainous parts. He's great at it.This film was very good and again, it played out like an old time Hollywood space opera (with top notch special effects) and maybe didn't hold the critics attention with the usual sights of mindless crap blowing up (though there's plenty of large and small scale battles in this movie, FYI) or the typical dumbed down dialog that seems to be more and more prevalent in so many movies, but it's certainly not a flop or failure in any respect. Good story, good cast, entertaining as hell, especially for people who like original scifi. Check it out.",John Carter
240,cartman_1337,"""Star Wars for a new generation""?",1,26 August 2013,"""Star Wars for a new generation""; that's what the Blu-ray cover would have us believe. If this is indicative of what Disney have in store for us with Star Wars Episode VII, then there is all reason to worry. And considering this was made by the same company, even with the same cinematographer confirmed for SWVII, there's good reason to think it is.Borrowing heavily from sci-fi movies like Star Wars, Star Trek and Avatar, and even from Disney's own animated sci-fi serial; Lilo and Stitch (the martian tribes looks exactly like, except for the color of the skin, the female boss in the alien affairs bureau, or whatever it was called, in said movie), and very little from the books it's actually based, this movie moves on as one of the least original movies I've ever seen. Instead it's one cliché after another, one massive rip-off after another, and what's worse, one piece of cheesy dialog after another. I thought fighting for Unobtanium, or whatever it was called, in Avatar sounded ridiculous; I laughed out loud at dialogs like ""We MUST fight for Helium"" in this one. It's even funnier thinking back at it, and thinking how they would have sounded if they actually HAD helium available when recording the dialog...How Disney thought they could cash in on the ridiculously large budget, using mainly actors no one had heard about prior to this movie, using a literary hero most had long since forgotten, is completely beyond me. Taylor Kitch is anything but convincing as the hero in this movie, and most of the supporting cast, in addition to being mostly second rate actors, are further drawn down by the cheesy looks of their alien beings, which like I said before looked like straight copies out of better sci-fi movies, and the laugh-out-loud cheesy dialog they have to deliver.It's all made worse that the plot in it self is at best ridiculous, at worst completely illogical, cheesy and way drawn out as though you're trying to smear a small piece of butter onto a much too large piece of bread. Is it entertaining? Only as much as some of the dialog or plot elements can actually make you laugh out loud in all their cheesiness. For me that was three times. The rest of the movie was boring and ridiculous. And yes, I know it's a sci-fi/fantasy movie, that requires you to accept things you normally wouldn't. But pretty much all sci-fi and fantasy movies of the past have one thing in common, which makes it all the easier to accept their fantasy; they are not set on Earth or anywhere near it. Because they know that once you set it on Earth, and especially in a historic context, such as this one, people will question your fantasies more, and hold them up to Earth logic and, in this case, history. And on that level this fails big time. It doesn't really help that John Carter ends up on Mars, and that most of the action takes place there, either, because it's still too near to what we know and accept. Try as I might, I was simply not able to look past all of that, and let myself get drawn into the fantasy, and the alien makeup and effects didn't make it any easier, since it looked exactly like things we've seen before, which for people who've seen many movies easily makes you care more about that than what they are trying to convey in the story. So notes to Disney; when making a $275m sci-fi movie; 1. don't use no-name actors, 2. don't set them in our Solar system and 3. don't make everything in the movie look exactly like other movies (not set in our Solar system, by the way) we've seen before. It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to 4. give your McGuffins better names, and make the dialog sound more believable either.Avoid this movie at all cost. It deserves to be lost and forgotten, and never spoken of again. With a rating of almost 6.6 I had some hope for this, but I ended up even more disappointed than I was with Avatar, which also was a huge copy-fest (basically Dances with Wolves with big Smurfs for the Indians), which I hardly thought possible. Oh well, at least I got a couple of laughs, although for all the wrong reasons...",John Carter
241,LordOfTheThundercats,DESERVES BETTER,10,13 May 2019,This is one of those films that after a disappointing run at the box office found a cult following on DVD.

242,merdiolu,John Carter : A mediocre combination of previous sci-fi/fantasy epics,5,11 March 2012,"I once read somewhere there are only seven stories to tell. By changing details like characters , environment , sequence of events and editing you can make them different or look like original ( and be successful ) But at the end there are just seven stories to tell. John Carter is a prime example of this.Plot is simple and familiar since the days of simple fairy tale era :( though it is understandable , we are talking about 100 year old sci-fi fantasy novel written by Edgar R. Burroughs as original story material I admit that it is nicely paced and edited.) The protagonist John Carter , a US Civil War veteran , a man robbed of his life purpose , suddenly finds himself in Mars of past...a long lost era when Red Planet was sustainable of life. Here with incredible jumping capabilities and physical powers he becomes a hero , a legend fighting on the side of good Helium city against evil Zadonga city , hooking up with a Princess needed to be saved , becomes buddies with six foot CGI Gungan like creatures from Star Wars etc.....In this era when virtual video games became more complicated and scripted like real stage plays or movie scripts themselves and movies became more and more like video games , John Carter relies more on visual effects , CGI and 3D as expected in the absence of original writing material. They are not bad but just like the story itself they are all in ""we have seen that before"" territory. In outdoor decors ,fashion , style and writing it is all like Star Wars Episode I , Prince of Persia , Avatar , Flash Gordon , TV series Rome 2005 ( it even has three Rome actors in similar roles ) and Farscape combined. It is not bad but as I said before , it is too FAMILIAR...As for acting although Taylor Kitsch did not impress me as regular young white muscled long haired handsome hero , rest of the cast was not bad. Lynn Collins was OK , from supporting actors Mark Strong was quite good as expected from his theater trained career. So were other live action actors like great Ciaran Hinds , Dominic West and James Purefloy with their limited screen time. Other decent actors like Samantha Morton , Polly Walker , Willem Defoe and Thomas Haden Church provide nice voice acting for Tarks if nothing else.John Carter of Mars is not a bad movie. It is enjoyable , enough to waste a couple hours. Kids will probably like it. One thing it would not be though. It won't be a franchise , something Disney longed to replace dying Pirates of Caribbean series. It is just too unoriginal and mediocre for that. Era of Eroll Flynn heroics are long past...",John Carter
243,petemcphee2,Massively underated sci-fi classic,8,19 July 2019,"Huge budget, fantastic special effects, great cast, great story and brilliant script.
Sadly because of its massive budget it failed to recoup it's production costs... A sequel is nowadays the answer to that problem, but in the early days of Disney making big budget SciFi they panicked and cancelled the sequel.
Watch it now and you will be amazed that special effects were this good in 2012.",John Carter
244,peterlane5,"If you can get past the fact that it is virtually an exact copy of Avatar, it's not that terrible of a movie.",4,10 March 2012,"""When I saw you, I believed it was a sign... that something new can come into this world."" Plot: A civil war veteran named John Carter is magically transported to Mars which is inhabited by green 12-foot, four armed barbarians known as the Tharks, and humans who are almost as technologically advanced as we are. Carter finds he has super-strength due to his bone density. Before long he becomes involved in a war that if not won by the city of Helium might spill over to Earth.Directed by Andrew Stanton( A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, Wall-E) and based on the novels by Edgar Rice Burrows(who makes an appearance as Carter's nephew), John Carter is a movie that could have been a masterpiece had it not been for the terrible script. It is almost like the writers, well if you can call them that, took the script from James Cameron's Avatar, crossed out a few things, added a minor plot point here and there, and called it a day. The Tharks are the Na'vi, Mars is Pandora, even how Carter got to Mars is nearly identical to how Jake Sully got transferred into his Avatar body, etc. The rest of the plot is taken from every Disney movie involving a princess. When it isn't doing those things it's ripping off Star Wars as well. There were countless times I either groaned or laughed when making the connections. There's nothing original about it. NOTHING. Now I haven't read the books, so it is quite possible James Cameron could have ripped off them, but until I am corrected I stand by my opinion that the script is absolute rubbish. It blows my mind that the man who gave us such treasures such as Wall-E and Finding Nemo could give us such a measly script. John Carter is such a bonehead his character to the point where he becomes unlikeable. He is put into situations that he could have simply avoided by speaking up. But maybe that makes him more human, still that doesn't give him the right to be a total idiot. That isn't the fault of actor Taylor Kitsch, who does OK despite what he's been given. Lynn Collins was the perfect choice for the role if Princess Dejah Thoris. She is both beautiful and a joy to watch. Dominic Cooper and Mark Strong as always make good villains. Willem Dafoe, Thomas Hayden Church, Samantha Morton, and Polly Walker( Atia of the Julii in the short lived but fantastic series Rome) all do great as the voices of the Tharks. My only problem is the miscasting of James Purefoy(who also starred in Rome) who's role as the Princess's right hand man is so minor they could have just done without him. Still even though he has only 10 or so lines, he still manages to stand out a bit. In my opinion Purefoy should have had Cooper's role as he also would have made a good villain. Breaking Bad's Brian Kranston makes a short but good appearance. Kids will enjoy the dog-like six legged creature. He is primarily used for comic relief, but doesn't overdo it like Jar Jar Binks did in Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace. But the greatest things about this movie are the costumes and effects. The costumes alone make this movie worth checking out and should be nominated in next year's Academy Awards. The same goes for the effects, but even those can't match Avatar's. Another thing I enjoyed was the landscape effects and cinematography. We are treated to sweeping shots of the Martian surface with ancient ruins even though it looks like Utah where it was filmed. The shots are nice but I never really felt as if I was on Mars. One final thing I enjoyed was the use of the color blue. Rather it be the blood, or the color of the characters' eyes, it really sticks out from the red and rustic colors. All in all I wasn't that impressed with it due to the fact that it IS a rip-off of Avatar and offers nothing new, but I did like a few things about it. Kids might enjoy it, but don't count on too many adults giving it high praise, because in the end, it is just another mindless action movie. Total Score: 4.8/10 Correction: Turns out Avatar did rip off the Princess of Mars books, but this movie could have still changed a few things around in order for the two films to not be exactly alike and it fails in the areas where Avatar succeeded.",John Carter
245,Pozdnyshev,Mediocre On Too Many Levels,5,13 October 2016,"John Carter, I understood, had the biggest budget to date of any movie ever made. It cost like a quarter billion dollars, so I went into it expecting something special. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver on too many levels to be anything more than a flashy but banal science fiction flick.The story is that there's a Confederate soldier (Carter) from the American civil war who finds a cave where he is mysteriously teleported to the planet Mars, or ""Barsoom"" as the natives call it. The difference in the two planet's gravities gives Carter great strength. With the help of a hot woman warrior, he helps the good aliens beat the bad aliens or something, I can't remember. Then he gets teleported back to Earth.Okay so like, the special effects are ubiquitous and of course quite well done. Endless armies of fully animated humanoid warrior-aliens in extremely complex native-American getup are seamlessly composited with the live action in scene after scene. The scenes at the alien city and at this giant hive or whatever are incredibly detailed, like a cross between Lord of the Rings' ""Lothlorien"" and Avatar.But... It just feels hollow because I'm not seeing anything I haven't seen before. It's not really imaginative, it's just breath-taking in a fifty-foot card castle kind of way. Okay, a city made out of red twisted tree roots. Great. Why? Oh look, humanoids with anteater snouts. Like that wasn't done thirty years ago in ""Star Wars"". Yawn.I didn't care about the characters. There was more chemistry between the animated characters than there was between the two leads, which wasn't much at all. Carter is supposed to be smart, but he comes across as a kind of dumb good-ol'-boy, the kind of tough but good-natured guy you knew in high school who would get drunk on beer and pee off of rooftops like it's the funniest thing in the world. The warrior chick had a lesbian vibe to her. It was weird.Last but not least, this is supposed to be based on the first science fiction story ever written. Well if that's so, then it was a kind of lame story. The only chunks of science fiction here are teleportation for no reason, and a planet's gravity's effect on one's strength.",John Carter
246,FFman-847-460126,Pretty Window Dressing,5,11 March 2012,"John Carter is, at its core, a copy and paste remake of several movies. Take a large glob of Avatar. Add in a dressing of Batman Begins. Finally, season it with Diego. Although this movie was enjoyable, it faked its imagination—the one thing it going for it with the director and screenwriter of WALL-E on the case. Add in some lackluster dialogue, and John Carter is pretty much a window dressing. Pretty on the outside. Nothing on the inside.The window dressing, I must admit, is quite fancy. The animation that created the aliens and the cities on Mars is extremely well done. Putting in strange animations—like the dog—only add to the glamor. It even helps move the storyline forward at times. Just like with Avatar, the scenes between aliens and humans provides for plenty of intrigue.At the heart of John Carter, however, is a major problem. The main idea is that a human on Mars will have super-human power because of the gravitational change and skeletal structure. Although the idea has merit, it is horribly executed. An earthling may be able to jump a few more feet and throw further. As the movie progresses, however, the awkwardness that John Carter initially experiences is all but forgotten— replaced by an absurd exaggeration of his abilities.The decision to place this movie in the second half of the 1800s is questionable. I know they had to do it to avoid the whole idea of space exploration and human's realization that there actually isn't life on Mars. When the movie began, this aspect was intriguing. How would they explain that Mars doesn't have life when we send our probes only 100 years later? Well, my question was never answered. On this front, John Carter decided to take a rain check.John Carter is enjoyable. If you have a kid who wants to go, they will enjoy it. Just don't expect much behind the curtains. You will get a storyline that you have seen before. You will have actors that cannot handle the job they have been given. You will have an idea that could have been great, but fell horribly short. We are still waiting for the first decent children's flick of 2012.reillyreviews.wordpress.com",John Carter
247,kdorsey321,Different,7,10 March 2012,"Got a chance to check out the movie ""John Carter,"" starring Taylor Kitsch (John Carter), Lynn Collins, and Mark Strong. This movie is about a Civil War veteran that is in the middle of saving two lives, (one of those lives includes himself) and some how gets warped to another planets. On this planet he discovers different life forms and life forms that are similar to him. He ends up in the middle of another war and falls in love with a princess.I have quite a few things I could say about this movie. For one there were parts that were a little confusing to me. The movie felt a little rushed and incomplete at times. I also felt as though some of the enemies in the movie that seemed to be a formidable challenged died to quickly. I felt as though I could defeat them. I also wanted more action. Looking at the preview it felt like a nice action packed movie. There was action of course, but not enough for me. John Carter is going into different worlds and interfering in different life form's wars. I expected a little more on the action tip.With that said, it wasn't a horrible movie. I've seen movies that were way worse! One of the things that I did like about this film were that it is different. It has it things that are different about it. There was a few Sherlock Holmes ""like"" parts to the movie that I kind of enjoyed. There were also parts that felt Star Wars ""like."" That was also enjoyable to have moments that reminded you of Star Wars. There were some things I thought were cool about the movie too. There was blue blood in the movie. I thought it was interesting. Being though they were on Mars, maybe if there were life forms on that planet they would bleed blue...I thought the alien dog in the movie was cool. The other planet in the setting of the movie being ""Mars"" was pretty cool to me too. Last put not least this movie also had its funny parts.Overall, I'm going to give this movie a 7 out of 10. This movie just wasn't good enough for me to rate it an 8. In the second paragraph of my review I break downs something's about the movie and off of that break down I can't give this movie past a 7 rating. If you gave this movie less than a seven I would understand. This is going to sound a little crazy, but I would still say this is a solid movie to see in the movie theater. This is not a movie I'm going to rush to buy on DVD though, and if you want to wait and catch it on Redbox or Netflix, you have my blessing. If you really are eager to see this movie, see it! If not, catch it on Netflix or Redbox. If I caught it in the movie store for $10.00 or less, I would buy it.",John Carter

249,gillman11,Not bad at all,7,21 May 2012,"John Carter (2012)A writer reads a friends journal, learning of his fantastic journey to planet of Mars, the warring factions therein and the beautiful princess he loved.hilarity ensues.Low expectations are an underrated commodity. Given the extremely poor nature of the trailers and the bad press it received, my expectations couldn't have been lower for a flick I still kind of wanted to see.Though thinking about it, most of the bad press was about the box office rather than the quality of the film, although some of the critic's reviews were very snippy. Seemed like some folks just had it in for Andrew Stanton, although quite why is puzzling. Previous credits being mainly Pixar based, screenplay/story credits on the Toy Story films and director of Finding Nemo and Wall-E. An odd hate figure, to say the least. Maybe he's a horrible person or maybe people just wanted a Pixar alum to fail.Because, contrary to everything, I found John Carter to be thoroughly entertaining. I'm not familiar with the Burroughs stories (do have recollections of the 70's Marvel Comics adaptation) so I can't really on its faithfulness to them but the tale is told quite cleverly with some verve.Probably the biggest thing working against it is that most of Burroughs' best ideas have been filched by other storytellers. A beautiful princess needing to be rescued by a chosen one from a force trying to build an empire, assisted by the machinations of a shadowy figure. A battle on floating airships over a desert. Chained hero fighting large beasties in a rock arena. Any of this ring any bells?Cripes. Even the energy weapon given to the main villain seems similar to the weapons fashioned from the Tesseract in Captain America and Loki's staff in The Avengers.So, there's that. Burroughs' ideas have been ""homaged"" left, right and centre in the 100 years since the first story was written. Unfortunately and probably due to a desire to be faithful to the stories as written, it leaves some of its ideas feeling somewhat second hand.There are a couple of longueurs where the film could have been tightened up and there are a number of moments where the green screen joins can be seen in the effects (potentially due to rushing to meet a release date) but these are quibbles.Taylor Kitsch looks the part though a tad lacking in charisma but Lynn Collins gets lovelier the longer the film runs and there is strong support from Ciaran Hinds, Dominic West and the vocal talents of Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church and Samantha Morton. Mark Strong seems to have the SF bald baddie axis tied up and one presumes casting directors come down to whoever's available between him and Hugo Weaving nowadays.I'd recommend at least one viewing of John Carter for lovers of SF and Fantasy, even for academic purposes when if, like me, you're a Burroughs' virgin. It could be an eye opener how much stuff old Edgar dreamt up.",John Carter
250,dario_malic,John Carter of...does it really matter?,5,25 June 2012,"The John Carter"" movie is based on a first book in the series written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. I guess that's the reason some things are left insufficiently explained – that is probably done in the sequels. I haven't read the book John Carter"" is based on and I'm sure those who have understood everything right from the beginning, but that doesn't mean it is done well. The first part of the movie tries to explain to the viewers too much in too little time. As if that wasn't enough, it does so jumping back and forth in time and between two planets, Earth and Mars. It isn't so confusing as it seems unnecessary. The situation between two colliding fractions on Mars could've been explained through the unfolding story in the movie as it certainly has time for that. Instead it seems director and/or screenwriters decided to explain the story to the viewers in the beginning so they could relax their minds and enjoy action scenes and corny dialogue for the rest of the movie. That is an unfortunate decision but the problems don't stop there. As you could imagine for a guy mysteriously transported to Mars language might be a problem. The way this is handled is so bad I'm not even sure I should say it IS handled. There are humans on Mars and they speak English from the first moment we see them, which is a lucky circumstance for our hero but they're not the first beings he encounters. Those are some natives who call themselves Tharks and don't speak English. John Carter begins to understand them only after he drank some kind of water, and I can go along with that. But how does that make them understand him all of a sudden? And how can humans from Mars and Tharks understand each other? Did they all drink that water? But if they did, that means Tharks can understand English so why didn't they understand Carter in the first place? Oh, my head is spinning!I'm really getting tired from just thinking about all the movie's faults but there are a few more things I should say. First and most important is the appearance of yet another race – Therns. They are the main villains in the movie and also the most intriguing characters. At some point in the movie one of the Therns explains to Carter that they are going from planet to planet and feed on conflicts between opposing sides and ultimately the destruction of the planets. Now that is an interesting concept and something I would've liked to saw more of, especially if we remember there are some Therns on the Earth too, but unfortunately the movie doesn't go there. Instead it opted (along with John Carter) for the salvation of Mars.So the hero comes out of nowhere, sides with the good guys, defeats the bad ones and of course, gets the girl. That sounds familiar? Oh, and did I mention he can jump very high? I bet you can't jump nowhere near as high as he can. But you can sure as hell jump right on to the next movie.http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",John Carter

The characters are likable. The scenery is natural. The aliens are enjoyable. The villains are rational, but not reasonable; immortal, but not invulnerable.There are of course some flubs in the dialogue. Most notably that the native martians have their own names of the planets in the solar system (which makes sense) but one of the central cities in the plot is known as Helium and one alien makes a reference to Hell (which makes less sense).One thing I wish they could have gone into greater detail on was the beginning of the war between the red and the blue.

What I would like to comment on, is the marketing campaign, or the lack of one. First off, they didn't have a clue how to market it, they wanted to go after female audiences, so they dropped John Carter of Mars, to just John Carter (does that explain anything to anyone?) Instead of revealing parts of the story, they literally had no ideal , the trailers, led to know where, was nonsensical at best. NOTHING leading up to the film portrayed how GOOD the film was, nor did they target core audiences, in fact they went out of their way NOT to target them. What a shame, this would've been one of the best trilogies of all time, but sadly is saddled with the title ""BEST FILM to be destroyed BY ONE of the WORST MARKETING campaigns ever"" Whomever, directed this campaign, hopefully learned a few lessons, other then destroying a fine work.",John Carter
255,artisticengineer,A great effort to show an Edgar Rice Burroughs story that does not include Tarzan,8,25 March 2012,"Edgar Rice Burroughs was the creator of Tarzan- Lord Greystoke who grew up among the apes yet somehow became an educated and mannered human being; while still being able to rule his ""tribe"" of apes. Though the Tarzan stories were adapted for movies the most well known ones did not show such an erudite side to the character; and these are the stories that most people know of the authorship of Burroughs. Actually, he wrote a number of novels for another character; John Carter, gentleman adventurer. And, in these novels this protagonist literally goes ""out of this world""! He goes to the planet Mars. A little bit of history here- in 1877 the noted Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli saw, through a telescope, some markings on the planet Mars that called ""canali"" (in his native Italian) and conjectured they were water channels. In the early 20th century the amateur astronomer Percival Lowell mistranslated this term and concluded the channels were canals instead. Canals are artificial waterways and constructed by humans. Of course, on Mars somebody other than humans would have to construct them and the nature of this ""somebody"" is what Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote his John Carter novels about. Do not get too involved with the plausibility or lack of in this movie. The nature of Mars was pretty much unknown when Burroughs wrote these novels. For all anybody knew then, great empires could exist on Mars. Burroughs wrote these novels when people felt that airships that were as large as sailing ships would eventually be built and fly at sailing speeds (i.e. <50 knots) instead of the very high speeds that aircraft actually fly at. Rather instead, view this movie as awe and grandeur as you are taken from the Wild West that John Carter found himself at and are transported instantly to a incredibly developed planet that nonetheless still has good guys, bad guys, heroes, villains, loyal pets, and a beautiful damsel in distress.

There are some plot holes, like the idea of a copy being in both worlds is not really be explained. It doesn't make sense since when he leaves Mars he disappears. So his body is always on Earth but not always on Mars? How can his body be essentially comatosed indefinitely? This copy idea is really only pointed out at the end of the movie. Which isn't good since it's the last thing you remember. Some meanings are underdeveloped like the Therns but depth isn't what the movie was after. On the surface, the action sequences were good and didn't linger too long. The characters and story are likable enough to carry the movie even if it stumbles from time to time.I believe there are several John Carter books and I feel like this movie tried to cover too much ground. The story was interesting enough that it could have been 2 or 3 movies. Carter's background could have been explored more along with the individual cultures of Mars. I still think it's a worthwhile viewing and better than what the critics said.",John Carter
258,sagar-swapna,Good Story Not So Good Story Telling,5,11 March 2012,"John Carter is one of the best when it comes to visual beauty. The Mars or so called Barsoom is beautifully filmed, the 3D effects are good with CGI battle sequences and the goodness just ends here. The film features the protagonist John Carter who lands on mars out of nowhere and for some reason falls in love with the princess of Helium and teams up with her to protect Helium from a threat which is not clearly defined. John Carter lacks the flair of a superhero and the acting of others are at mediocre levels. Bad script, clunky dialogs, absolutely no humor and lack of detailing of the plot doesn't allow the audience to get connected to the film. The movie moves too fast yet it seems too lengthy. All the superhero movie that has succeeded in past is just because of the connection it made to the audience, we love superman, spider man, Batman(Joker)etc, But you will simply not love John Carter. Disney please learn from your mistakes I hated TRON legacy and now I didn't like John Carter. 8 out of 10 for visual effects 2 out of 10 for story telling",John Carter
259,ravenosa,Worse than I was led to believe.,2,14 March 2012,"It's been a while since I've seen such a flat fantasy film (can't really call it sci-fi). I'm thinking back to the 90's with some of the generic post-apocalyptic films we'd get. Actually, in the 80's there was ""Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn"" which is what I kept thinking of when watching ""John Carter"".The Good: if you like explosions, things explode. There are some decently designed costumes, which would have been great in a completely different film, not about Mars.The Bad: editing, screenplay, acting, characters, lack of rooting interest in any of the main characters, lack of rooting interest in action scenes.The Ugly: Lynn Collins acting. She was really, really trying, but the heavy delivery with the British accent, she sounded like an extra from ""Spartacus: Gods of the Arena"".I kept waiting for Lucy Lawless to walk on screen and say, ""can you tone it down, it's just a Disney movie? This isn't a high school Shakespeare play!"" The scenery. Was it Utah or Arizona? I'm not sure but the movie never took me to Mars.The jumping. Oh, the jumping.You want to understand why it failed? There are some great reviews that really analyze all that went wrong with JC, from the curious decision to open with a big, messy battle scene with establishing, well, anything. At the end of the scene, you felt like the filmmakers were saying, ""we didn't know a better way to introduce the bad guys, so here ya go..."" In general, motivation, drive behind any character was totally missing. Just seemed like the actors weren't really given much direction as far as who they were supposed to be.Really sad. Terrible attempt at making a fantasy/sci-fi film. Already dated. Already a failure the moment it hit the screen. You know a film is that bad when the second you see a trailer you know it's a dud.",John Carter

Obviously this is a film for the young...but at least this one is more about a story - it is not just special effects, fights, and monsters. There are even some good monsters. But above all - there is some good acting. Matai Shang = Mark Strong has a wonderful screen presence. The two main characters John Carter = Taylor Kitsch, and Dejah Thoris = Lyne Collins give convincing and touching performances – there is a real love story here, that feeds my need for chick flicks. I am almost hooked....and planning to see it again of course - and may even give it a better mark.

Although they are relative unknowns they are perfectly cast. There are some familiar faces like Dominic West & Mark Strong. It is best just to sit back & enjoy the ride. This is a two bags of popcorn movie. If you go to the concession stand you might miss something. But since you will probably want to see it again that's OK. John Carter has a pet that kind of looks like a bulldog. He provides the only comic relief. The ending sets you up for a sequel. I am eagerly awaiting that. And also a third. Mark Strong makes a good villain and I am not sure what happens to him at the end. I'll definitely have to see it again.,John Carter
262,Thomas-Giffin,A thoroughly entertaining film,8,14 March 2012,"Just like E.R.B (as he shall be known) would have been, I am pretty amazed at the amount of money that was pumped into this film. Previous Disney live-action blockbuster Tron: Legacy took a mere $170 million to make, this took a rumoured $250 million at least.To be honest, this is a film that should not have been made. A pulp sci-fi novel in the vein of my childhood stories, with aliens on mars, spaceships, princesses in distress seems so anachronistic with films of this generation. Films like Avatar (which I would most closely compare John Carter to) try so hard to appear socially relevant and in doing so, remove some of the joyful escapism that I crave when I go to the cinema. On top of this you include a huge budget and a lack of in-your-face advertising and it would seem that the film was doomed to fail.That is one of several reasons I wanted to go see the film, I want this film to succeed. There are enough novels and stories to make a franchise of it and the idea of a series of films that are just pure fantasy and escapism without preaching eco-disaster appeals to me.But the film itself is so entertaining.It's not perfect by any means, let me get that out of the way, the pacing is sometimes uneven and the acting suffers at times.Read more at: http://thegiff.typepad.com/film_flare/2012/03/23.html",John Carter
263,LeonardOsborneKael,Spectacular -- Transporting -- Surprisingly Moving High Adventure Epic!,10,28 February 2012,"By my standards, ""must-see"" films are getting to be rather rare. This one is by all means a MUST-SEE for everyone who loves science fiction and/or super heroes! Long before Superman, there was John Carter. Many have very likely forgotten what a resourceful and imaginative writer Edgar Rice Burroughs was. Most people only know he authored the original TARZAN. The movie JOHN CARTER is based on Burroughs' novel, A PRINCESS OF MARS, and his 1911 vision of an advanced civilization on Mars is truly astonishing. Upon seeing this, the first question you will likely ask is, ""How is it no one has filmed this fantastic, mind-blowing, eye-popping, compelling sci-fi adventure saga before?"" Well, there have been a few faint attempts but the true realization of John Carter's magnificent adventures waited patiently for the masterful CGI wizardry of director Andrew Stanton and the 2012 resources of Disney/Pixar. Amazingly, Mr. Stanton shot this heavily CGI-based epic on film! According to the director, he did so simply to see what it was like to make a movie like this on film before film is gone. The experience apparently has made him a fan of the classic motion picture medium and I imagine we will hear more from him on why. Of course I'm not going to give anything away. Suffice it to say that, thankfully, JOHN CARTER is a complete film experience: a suspenseful, dazzling story -- efficiently and superbly told -- with dramatic and unforgettable visuals -- and compelling, moving performances. Lynn Collins is particularly brilliant and beguiling as the exotic and dynamic Martian princess. Throughout the film the detail is extraordinary and the pacing is right on the mark, relentlessly drawing you forward into the wonder of this newly discovered, challenging, turbulent world. What a magnificent adventure saga! Let's put it this way: if you liked Sinbad, you will LOVE John Carter. Thanks to a sure-handed director, an inspired cast, and state of the art technical people, it's a fulfilling experience that I predict will remain with you always -- especially if you are among the young! JOHN CARTER is the ultimate exotic adventure; a masterpiece of cinematic action and pacing.",John Carter

Leaving aside its ridiculous budget - that it didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of recouping-what you've got is a good old fashioned, knees bent, running around Sci-fi romp that has one foot firmly planted in the old 30s Sci-fi serials like Buck Rodgers and Flash Gordon. For a film with such an astronomic budget a lot of the CGI is very lacking but the weird, but very captivating, story of a Western era cavalryman transported to a feudal Mars delivers great action and thrills in buckets. Taylor Kitsch does a very good job of portraying the gruff Carter and there's also the usual line-up of top drawer British & Irish thesps chewing the scenery with Mark Strong's usual great villain turn really standing out.The legacy of what is a very entertaining romp (that still manages to feel a bit vacant at times) that 'only' made about 100 million at the box office, will be studios backing away from similarly 'risky' Sci-fi stories.",John Carter
267,turnbull50,An underrated classic,10,13 May 2018,I loved the idea of bringing this story into a film it had been done before but not as good as this. I liked the way the low gravity on Mars was used to give John Carter strength. The fight in the arena was very well executed. Any lover of the Edger Rice Burrows books would have loved this film it's a great pity it was not continued on in further films. The actor playing the lead part was excellent. The main problem I fear was the title John Carter they should have just added the words on Mars. So the film should have been called John Carter of Mars. I loved the twist at the end.,John Carter
268,MannyInNewYork,No spoiler and no story info,9,18 July 2012,"Rent it, watch it and enjoy it.I read this series as a young man (early teens) and loved it. It was the early 60s and the John Carter of Mars series was a lesson in courage, honor, morality and love. It was such a well written set of books. When I heard that they were making a real movie (not the Sci-fi channel version) I was intrigued. Unfortunately, the reviews were less than stellar and I expected this to be boring at best and a discredit to Mr. Burroughs. How wrong I was and how wrong are those that gave it a negative review. It's a beautiful Sci-fi movie (I know that sounds odd) and a real tribute to the John Carter series. I was surprised at how much of the imagery was in line with what I'd imagined as a young man. If you have read the series, watch the movie - it is really very, very well done. It brought me right back to the time when I was reading the books. It's terrific. If you didn't read the books (and I'd expect anyone under 60 hasn't), it's a shame because you might not see this for the great version that it is . So, to all those involved in the movie I simply say thanks, it was a real joy to watch this. I will watch this again and again. Great Sci-fi - a wonderful story brought to life by a terrific cast and screenplay worthy of the story. What a surprise!",John Carter

There's nothing in this movie I haven't seen in other Science Fiction Fantasy movies before. Lynn Collins was a great princess, but the movie (John Carter) was definitely lacking something. ""John Carter"" needed a better director, someone like Ridley Scott, Peter Jackson or Tony Scott. This movie reminded me of the Phantom Menace, Stargate and Tarzan all rolled into one. Photography could have been better, the story better, the pacing better. For me, Lynn Collins stole the show, like she stole the show in ""Merchant of Venice."" Lynn was ""the movie"". If only the movie had the depth of presence like Lynn's acting, it would have been a better and different movie. The Retro Sci-Fi feeling of Edgar Rice Burroughs world didn't not come across well enough for me.

272,Schnayblay,Disney's Next Forced Franchise Follows in the Wake of It's Predecessors... It's Bad,5,13 June 2012,"From the moment I first heard about ""John Carter of Mars"", (because that's what it should have been called and what the logo they designed implied), I already knew this movie was going to disappoint. Disney has been pushing for a new franchise since ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"", because none of their live-action films other than ""National Treasure"" have been able to generate box-office or critical acclaim. So they're really desperate. ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" was only OK, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" was a giant letdown, and ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" just raped its franchise harder than anyone thought the two before it had. So with the whole sci-fi setting, a 250 million dollar budget, and given Disney's recent live-action situation, I was like ""Ok, I am not seeing ""John Carter of Mars"" in theatres. I am gonna rent this"". And I did just that. And I'm glad I did.""John Carter of Mars"" is about John Carter, an ex-military man in 1879 who gets transported to Mars, or as the natives know it, Barsoom. The natives 'aquire' Carter to be their champion and so through various plot points that I don't care to explain, John Carter must now save the princess from marrying an evil tyrant named Sab Than, so that the entire planet of Barsoom isn't taken over by the tyrant and his army. When I was watching this movie I was seriously saying to myself 'there is way too much going on'. As you watch it, the plot gets so stupidly complex and convoluted, it makes your head hurt. This movie is kiddie entertainment, and I can easily imagine a kid looking up at his dad and asking what's going on every 10 minutes because he doesn't understand this stupid complex plot.Taylor Kitsch plays John Carter. He is the most boring character of this movie, which is really terrible because it's HIS movie, he's the titular hero. He's just an asshole, really. The whole movie he just wants to get back to earth because he found a cave of gold. And then he goes through a character arc that's really cliché and stupid, and he becomes the hero he's supposed to be. I didn't care for him the entire movie though. He was a good Gambit in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", no one can argue that. But I really don't see this guy as A-list action hero material, which is what Hollywood seems to be pushing him as, with movies like ""Battleship"" and ""Savages"". If he's half as bad as he was in ""John Carter of Mars"", I am not going to like those two other movies.Mark Strong plays Matai Shang, the real lead villain. They push Sab Than as the main villain, but I get a total sense of control from Mark Strong's character. He just seems like he knows everything. It seems like Mark Strong has become the new main villain actor in all movies lately. ""Sherlock Holmes"", ""Kick-Ass"", ""Green Lantern"", and now this. It really sucks because he's not even interesting. It's just Mark Strong.Willem Dafoe as Tars Tarkas, the only part of the movie I had any hope for, get's pushed aside like 50 minutes into the film and comes back for the last fight, in which he doesn't hardly do any fighting. It really sucks, because Willem Dafoe is one of the most unsung amazing actors ever. He can play almost anything and I will believe him. But in this movie it seems like Andrew Stanton just wanted a big name to voice an alien in this movie so he got Willem Dafoe because let's face it, Dafoe isn't doing much these days.A lot of people say that the visuals in this film rival ""Avatar"". And to that I say bullshit. It seems like the 250 million dollar budget was only used so they could make the scope wide, but the attention to detail just wasn't at all there for me. I didn't see any incredible motion capture or really detailed textures on the aliens at all. This movie might have looked impressive in 2007, in my opinion. The visuals weren't charming either. There was nothing that I saw and went ""that's pretty cool"". It just feels like Andrew Stanton took visual elements from ""Firefly"", ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", and ""Treasure Planet"" and blended them together to try to create something visually unique. And it wasn't.That's a way I could summarize this whole review. This movie feels like something you've seen plenty of times, and has been done way better. The film would have looked impressive in 2007, but would've probably been good and we might actually treasure it, if it came out in 1979. It's campy, it's silly, it's annoyingly simple popcorn entertainment, and it's only worth like $5 on DVD. Unless you see it for that price, do not bother picking up ""John Carter of Mars"".",John Carter
273,Pycs,"The book's a classic, but as for the film. . .",6,19 March 2012,"The more I think about 'John Carter', the more I see the similarities between it and 'Avatar'. Both films are huge-budgeted, ambitious science fiction films that seem to showcase to much beautiful CGI (boy, does that feel weird to say), rather than tell an all too original and compelling story.Now, before you think too yourself that I was not aware that this was based on a book, you're wrong. I understand that the book was written in 1912 (which is incredibly ahead of its time), and many, many science fiction films and stories have borrowed elements (such as 'Avatar.')I wish it would have just given us something new. The princess story is clichéd and predictable, the main characters journey from foreigner to hero has been done many times before, the villains who seem to lack any sort of motivation doesn't help matters for that fact as well.Is it visually appealing? Of course. It's beautiful. Gorgeous. Stunning. But as a complete story, does it make coherent sense and is paced well? No. Not at all.I'd recommend for big sci-fans to check it out, they won't be disappointed. As for the average viewer, waiting until it's able to rent is the way to go.",John Carter
274,Kane20,Review - John Carter,7,4 August 2012,"My Rating: *** (out of ****)I saw John Carter in the theater on Friday, March 14. I've never read the books that the movie is based on, but based on the reviews I've skimmed, I had pretty low expectations for the film. And a lot of the negative aspects I sort of expected of the film were confirmed. Overall, I didn't like the film, but I did sort of enjoy it a little, sort of as a guilty pleasure, almost. The CGI is great, and very convincing, and I enjoyed the visual experience. As for the story and other important aspects, the film is a bit weak. There are many flaws in the film; there's no denying that. The story is derivative, and it suffers from a somewhat sloppy and slightly convoluted plot. Overall, in my opinion, it's basically a two-and-a-half star (out of four stars) film, but it hits enough high notes and sustains enough energy along the way to be enjoyable as a sci-fi blockbuster and scrape a three star rating (and a 7 on IMDb) from me.The movie is about John Carter, a Civil War veteran who is trying to lead a normal life. He is locked up for refusing to join the Army, but he escapes and is pursued. After a bit of action, he hides in a cave, in which he encounters someone holding a medallion. When Carter touches the medallion, he is transported to Mars, where the lower gravity enables him to leap incredible heights. His first encounter with the natives are with the tall, green-skinned, four- armed, horned Thorks. Soon, he ends up rescuing a princess, Dejah Thoris, of another native group on the planet called the ""red"" humanoids, and he soon learns of the civil war going on between that group and the other group, the ""blue"" humanoids.The director, Andrew Stanton, has previously directed animated films, such as Finding Nemo and Wall-E, and this is his first live-action movie, which may have contributed to the flaws in the movie. Like I said, the movie is very flawed. It's somewhat sloppy, and a bit confusing at times, and not fully coherent (but it's not incoherent). The progression of the story and the interrelation and connection of everything in it doesn't completely fit, and is not really how it should have been. A few things actually felt to me like they were almost thrown together. And in a few ways, it felt almost like a cartoon. However, the movie does maintain acceptable coherency, etc., and it maintains a level of energy that kept me at least somewhat entertained; surprisingly, I never got bored during this movie. The movie is a bit confusing at times, and there are a few twists, and I had a bit of trouble keeping track of some names and stuff, but it doesn't really matter, because it's pretty easy to understand the overall plot. In fact, I actually left the theater at one point to go to the restroom, and I came back three minutes later, but it didn't matter because it was pretty easy for me to pick up on what was basically happening.There are some positive things that I can say about the movie. The visuals are great, and everything in the movie is very well portrayed with the CGI, and in pretty good detail. The movie introduces a new culture/world/etc., although it doesn't stand out as a character within itself, like the new world in Avatar did. But it's still pretty nice. I also liked the ships; they were very well designed. In fact, all the special effects were good. Dejah Thoris is very pretty, and she's a highlight of the movie. I liked the cast of the movie, especially Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins. I also somewhat liked the music score. The story, plot, progression, development, and pacing all needed to be much better.Overall, I didn't particularly like the movie, but it was better than I thought it would be. I found it a bit enjoyable, although I would definitely not recommend it for any awards or special recognition or anything. If fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this movie is forgotten in the near future. In my opinion, it's basically a two-and-a-half star movie, but it does hit enough high notes to be a bit enjoyable as a sci-fi blockbuster and to scrape (although barely) a three star rating from me. Although, it's not a movie that I could really watch over and over again; once was really enough for me.For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/",John Carter

It is based on a story written by the author of Tarzan himself so you know it's good. Basically the hero John Carter a civil war veteran gets transported to Mars and due to the heavier gravity on earth he is able to almost fly (jump long distances high basically) and possesses amazing strength. Although a lot of the natives are 12 foot tall and he isn't. He gets involved in a civil war basically and has to reluctantly help a princess. Thats my spoiler but there's a reason I only gave this movie a 7.The story is very hard for your average 12 year old to understand and they will get bored unless they are willing to try and understand none human phrases and at some parts read subtitles? Apologies for the description but this is supposed to be an alien culture and they do have their own words and phrases which you pick up as you watch, same as learning a foreign language. I saw this movie today and approximately 12-14 12 year olds came in to watch and got themselves thrown out after 20 minutes as the movie is not all action and they struggled to grasp the story and its very clever concept (and got bored and the usual ensued).

278,lmcressia,"bad premise, bad movie",4,16 January 2018,"This movie was bad -- there are no other words for it. The sad thing is, with its premise, there was NO WAY this movie could have been good. The only move with a worse premise is ""Yor - The Hunter from the Future"". Look ythat one up on IMDB! In any case, the premises are nearly the same, in Yor a caveman defeats aliens who possess spaceships and lasers, and in John Carter, a civil war soldier defeats aliens who possess spaceships and lasers. A civil war soldier. defeats aliens wielding lasers for airborne craft. Are you still wanting to defend this? How was he able to accomplish this? Because he could jump well -- because the gravity on Mars is less than on Earth, he could jump really far -- much farther than would physically be possible, in fact. Also it appeared he intermittently had superhuman strength. Since punching is more horizontal than vertical, the gravity thing doesn't really influence it -- so I am not sure where this superhuman strength came from, or why one minute he could kill a big alien with one punch and the next he punched a normal sized person and they fell over (not dead) when you'd expect them to fly across the room (and be dead). Also, the end... I hope he knows the princess has moved on in the last ten years. Especially after (she thinks) he bailed on her. Just sayin'.",John Carter
279,IllusionOfLife,Worth a Second Look,8,11 March 2012,"I must admit, I'm doing this a bit differently than normal. Typically I will review a movie immediately after my first viewing, but when I saw John Carter at midnight Friday morning I was not able to put a rating on it, let alone elaborate on my opinions of the work. Now that I've seen it a second time I feel I have a clearer perspective from which I can accurately review the film. To bring you up to speed (because Disney's marketing department utterly failed in this area) John Carter is based on the novel A Princess of Mars, a book written in 1912 by Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) about an American Civil War soldier named John Carter who is mysteriously transported to Mars (or Barsoom, as its Martian inhabitants refer to it) where he gets caught up in a war between two of Barsoom's cities. Due to the lower gravitational pull on Mars, Carter is granted superhuman strength which Deja Thoris, princess of Helium (one of the warring cities) hopes he'll use to help defend her city from the Zodongans (the other warring city). A Princess of Mars and the subsequent books in the Barsoom series went on to inspire, directly or indirectly, just about every single work of Science Fiction and Fantasy that has followed it. The movies that George Lucas borrowed from when making Star Wars borrowed heavily from these books, and John Carter is near the top of the laundry list of works James Cameron ripped off while making Avatar. For nearly 100 years people have been trying and failing to make a film based on these stories, then several years back Disney acquired the rights and gave the project to Pixar veteran and life-long John Carter fan Andrew Stanton. In John Carter, Andrew Stanton crafts a good old-fashioned sci-fi adventure film full of interesting creatures, a deep mythology, and a fascinating world to house it all. Barsoom and its inhabitants are beautifully realized and despite the novel having been ripped off hundreds of times it still manages to feel interesting and unique. Stanton said that his goal in creating Barsoom was to treat it the same way he would treat a movie based on historical fact, recreating something that actually existed as opposed to going crazy with the visual style and I think this method worked really well. Barsoom feels like a very real and grounded place and the effects work is seamlessly integrated in to the environments to the point where it's difficult to tell what elements are practical sets and which are CG enhancements, not to mention the excellent motion capture and animation work done on the Tharks and other alien inhabitants. There are several stand out action scenes in the film and Stanton proves himself as a more than competent action director, creating gripping and surprisingly brutal battles, and when the movie hits its stride it's a lot of fun. Unfortunately, there's a plot transition in the second act and during this time the film starts to feel a little bit bogged down by exposition, exposition that can be slightly hard to follow as it throws out terms like the Ninth Ray, Issus, Therns, etc. It almost feels as if Andrew Stanton tried to fit as much of the Barsoom mythology into one film as he could in case he did not get the opportunity to direct the two sequels he has planned for this film, and while it improves on a second viewing, the first time around it's a bit much to swallow. Overall, though, the movie is quite fun and there's not a whole lot I can complain about. The exposition dump in the middle of the film is a bit tough to chew on and Taylor Kitsch's performance is slightly flat, but with a great supporting cast, a terrific female lead in Lynn Collin's Deja Thoris, and a satisfying payoff the movie ends on a high note. I think the reason it took me a second time viewing the film to really appreciate it was that I had set my expectations unrealistically high. Stanton's work at Pixar has made him one of my favorite filmmakers and that first night I wasn't going to be satisfied with anything less than a masterpiece on the level of WALL-E, but what I got was a very fun, if imperfect, sci-fi adventure film. I really do hope that he gets the opportunity to direct the sequels to this movie, because now that I've gotten a taste of it I would love to dive further into the world and mythology of Barsoom, and I don't want anyone else but Stanton as my guide for that journey.

280,ivanaaaaaaaaa,What was I thinking??,8,18 February 2019,"This movie is the perfect example of how actors influence our movie experience.I saw this movie years ago (probably around the time it came out) and I didn't remember much about it, other than it was ""old timey"" and I did not like it at all. Back then I didn't rate many movies on IMDB, but for some reason I actually rated this one and gave it a 5. Ha!In the last few years, movies have become my favorite hobby, and I know my tastes have changed some. I've also gone from not really knowing who Taylor Kitsch is, to him becoming one of my favorite actors. His character in season 2 of True Detective really caught me by surprise and I've been hooked ever since.I've been kind of scared to rewatch this, I was afraid I'd still hate it. But, I made an impulse decision tonight and watched it after all. Boy, am I glad I did! Sure, it's predictable and maybe a little corny at times, but it's such a fun ride. It has so many great elements - action, humor, chivalry, honor, science fiction, romance - but not too much of any of them.If you're a fan of Taylor Kitsch, Dominic West, Mark Strong, etc, you should really give this one a chance. (And whether or not you know who Lynn Collins is, it doesn't matter, because she is stunning and you won't be able to keep your eyes off her. I'm a straight female and I was almost as mesmerized by her as I was Taylor Kitsch. Almost. :)) Just don't take it too seriously and you won't be disappointed.",John Carter

The graphic was a sometimes not that good, easy to see computer animation. The story very bad and acting was mostly like ""I do not believe in this myself"". So no, it wasn't worth $200 millions. I even caught myself almost falling a sleep sometimes, and that is really bad for a movie in that amount class.I mean see Battleship or The Avengers, it is in that amount class, but those two beat the crap out of John Carter. The title is also very bad, no one in Europe knows who the hell John Carter is.And life on mars is just so outdated, that it is amazing Disney didn't even want to make this movie. Life on Mars is boring, because it is not even possible to imagine it because it is so close to us. So the story fell before it was started. Maybe it was cool in the 80' but not in the year 2012.And when you get a crew that seems to have been more interested in picking up the paycheck than the story...as audience you see that in the movie.Sorry but being kind I'll give it a 6/10 here.For that amount of money it should have been much, much better.",John Carter

Great plot. Wonderful characters. Just the right blend of humor, romance, and action sequences.

'John Carter' is a sci-fi that should be another universe's generation to Star Wars and Avatar. The company Double Negative and other companies made a big bang job on the visual effects. The effects were good in Matai Shang's eyes making them big dark blue and the Tharks as well. The Tharks really remind you of the ""Na'vi""s (from Avatar) when you first see them but you can clearly see a few major differences what they look like to the Na'vis. I think Taylor Kitsch is the perfect person to play John Carter. I'm not really sure if Sam Worthington could be better. Remember critics and box office records went so poorly that it became Hollywood's biggest flop? I mean come on, it isn't THAT bad. It didn't need to lose £200m from Disney. Ever since 'Star Wars' finished you'd be thinking, 'What would replace it?'.

Unfortunaty I didn't read it. But a little research put me aware about the book series, and I know it ain't exactly like the movie. But that's not what I'm gonna talk about here.Never heard about it before, but awhile I was watching the movie, i've got impressed how lotta different things were mixed, and unconsciously referenced. The soundtrack seems been took from Star Wars, Mars looks like Borderlands, and airplanes built up by Alladin's villain Mechanicles. THAT WAS AMAZING! I've seen thousand syfy movies and not even Firefly have used so amazing references like John Carter.And there was the Twists. Yup, lots of them. Some things are easy to figure out (boring cliché) but there was some good surprises too.But what was missing? Good characters interpretation. The two main ones were just not convincing me.

And since voice interpretation was nice i can't complain much about anything besides Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collings.To finish: 1 This movie captivated me so much I really compared it with Avatar, and I gotta say: lot better!. 2 Didn't understand it's rate. 3 There is 500 reviews, read others to see what people think about it if you're confuse about how to spend your next to hours.But seriously.

So I started watching this movie with the thought 'at least I've given it a shot'.Well, I watched the whole thing start to finish. The story is good, if not great. Same can be said of the effects and indeed the acting. Butgiven the sum of it's parts, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

There's some minor problems with the script (setting is so vast that several details could easily have been lost), and the cast is also not as good as it should be. But the story works and works great - mainly because of amazing Barsoom world, filled with different creatures, mechanisms and characters.

289,commander_zero,"A long journey awfully long, but worth the trip.",7,16 March 2012,"I became familiar, very familiar, with Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""John Carter"" series in its Ballantine Books editions in the 1960s, and years later I read the first few books in the series to my sons over a number of bedtimes. Back in the sixties, I wondered what they would be like as films, and knew that they were far beyond the technical capabilities of that era's cinema—although if in the 1960s, a studio had decided to commit the 1960s equivalent of ""John Carter's"" enormous budget to such a project, it would have paid for an awful lot of models and stop-motion animation.At any rate, ""John Carter,"" an adaptation of the first novel in Burroughs' series, A Princess of Mars, has been produced with an enormous budget and treated with the respect it deserves. In fact, probably more respect than it deserves, but I'll get to that shortly.The ""John Carter"" books were mass market fiction—none of them were very long, and this film's main defect is that the plot of ""Princess,"" such as I remember it, has been extended and complicated. Some of the effects of this are good: for example, an added backstory now makes the hero's sudden teleportation to Mars, return and death, or non-death make perfect sense (in the books it was always a bit of a head-scratcher), within a concept slightly expanded from the books. So, as with most epics (and I write this as someone who's never been able to sit through any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and thinks all the Sam Raimi ""Spiderman"" films would benefit from tighter editing) there is simply too much. The whole thern/Sab Than (bad guy) relationship is a bit puzzling—who are the therns anyway, and why do they need him?—and late in the film, when Kantos Kan appears—in the books he is Carter's friend, and in the film he should have stuck around longer—he (James Purefoy) so resembles Sab Than (Dominic West) that there are moments of confusion just when the action is at its height.In fact, there is a whole alien world the filmmakers have to make comprehensible to us, and they have chosen to extend and complicate at times when it would have been better to compress and simplify. It's not as if Burroughs necessarily wrote wonderful plots—he was a pulp writer, and although the first books in any of his series, including ""Tarzan,"" were imaginative and well thought-out, one could soon tell that in subsequent novels he would just sit down at his manual typewriter and wing it.What should have been complicated are the relationships at stake. The good guy who arrives among savages, wins their respect, and galvanizes them to storm the castle and save the beautiful princess— these are hoary clichés that the cinema audience has seen endlessly, most recently in ""Avatar."" Now here's an aspect of the film that could have used complicating. If the therns can travel from planet to planet, shouldn't John Carter be tempted to ally himself with them? Is the feisty and combative Deja Thoris really so ready to trade a planetful of princes for this pale-skinned foreigner? And what about that long voyage to the sacred island—didn't that merely supply exposition that could have been provided in a few sentences?That said, this could be the best-LOOKING film I've ever seen. Not only in the extravagant and amazing special effects, but in the colour schemes, costume and set design. The acting is good, the humour works, and the longish preamble, which includes Victorian London and the Wild West, doesn't seem too long. Now, if there had just been a bit more editing",John Carter
290,cosmonadz,Hybrid Sci-Fi,6,6 March 2013,This is what happens when a movie tries too hard and instead of being something it wants to be ends up being many things its not!! I found the film disjointed and lacking in keeping me interested. It was just jumping from left to right without actually moving forward strongly. Was it trying to be like star wars or was the movie molding itself on Aatar? Maybe slights subtle hints of Indiana Jones OK maybe not but it was not a great sci-fi action film. The plot was thin at best and the action fun but not serious enough. Was he being heroic or looking for redemption there were confusing signals from the lead character which made you think is Disney trying to attach its usual subliminal message within the film? Maybe I'm being too critical although I enjoyed watching the movie I didn't take it serious from almost the outset. Not a strong cast and minimal effort in the performances. The aliens were a distraction more than anything. Although I wasn't left too disappointed I did expect more but then again it's Disney how much of anything can I expect. Let's hope for better things in the future...please don't ruin the Star Wars franchise I am now beginning to dread Disney.,John Carter
291,dalelawson-1,"A slow-paced, overly complicated sci-fi/fantasy film with mediocre acting and special effects that aren't that special",4,16 March 2012,"Elaborate special effects, a large budget and a week plot are often three aspects that define a blockbuster movie. Everyone also always expects them to be somewhat enjoyable and entertaining, whether you are a film critic, movie-buff or just an occasional cinema goer. So when John Carter (Dir. Andrew Stanton, 2012), the first blockbuster of the year, was released; audiences expected an entertaining linear narrative. What we weren't expecting was a slow paced, overly complicated sci- fi/fantasy film with mediocre acting and special effects that really weren't that special. John Carter follows, you guessed it, the character John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) as he attempts to find a hidden cave of gold after fighting in the American civil war. Through a series of events he is accidentally transported to Mars where he befriends a tall, four-armed alien race and a lost princess. Eventually he ends up fighting the various factions of Mars in order to protect and marry Dejah Thoris (Lynn Colins), the said princess. The budget should be addressed first after watching John Carter. It is estimated to have a budget of $250,000,000 which seems an extortionate amount considering even Avatar (Dir. James Cameron, 2009) had a lower budget of $237,000,000, and John Carter's special effects do not compare to that of Avatar's. Yes, John Carter does look nice, and it does have some fantastic motion-capture animation, but it is definitely not $250,000,000 worth of effects. The ability of all the actors in John Carter varies from excellent to unfortunately terrible. Willem Dafoe is one of the excellent few, along with Mark Strong, as he provides an emotionally attaching and believable tribal alien leader, Tars Tarkas. The films protagonist, John Carter, and his love interest, Dejah Thoris, are both reasonably performed by Kitsch and Colins. Unfortunately Dominic West, who plays the faction leader trying to conquer Mars, was terrible. He was handed a bland, one- dimensional character by the script writers and therefore was unable to develop the character to any success. After bad mouthing the film for almost the whole of the review it is about time I say something good about it. There is one scene in particular worth mentioning. John Carter engages, about half way through the film, in combat with hundreds of a rival alien race. During this fight scene it cuts between Carter battling on Mars, and his wife and child back on Earth. This scene is the most heartfelt in the whole film, and it almost seems worthwhile watching the film just for this one scene. John Carter is a standard blockbuster movie with action, explosions and special effects. However it won't appeal to the masses due to its obscure sci-fi/fantasy genre mix with swords and solar powered planes on Mars battling Avatar-esc aliens. This film has flopped on its opening weekend, and I can not see it making its money back. I also cannot see there being a sequel filling the Pirates of the Caribbean void; as much as the director, actors and Disney would have hoped. http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",John Carter
292,nerdomatic10-937-667230,"Nerds Unite! Ignore the criticism and go see ""John Carter""!",10,21 March 2012,"This movie is actually very enjoyable but the Disney execs bungled radically in their handling of it. The marketing was incredibly inept and in fact sabotaged the film far more successfully than any competitor could've ever done. Anyone unfamiliar with Edgar Rice Burroughs wouldn't know the first thing about John Carter and the nondescript title (""of Mars"" was removed) was coupled with a botched ad campaign that made it appear like just another imitation of Star Wars/Avatar/Dune, etc. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not only was ERB there first, he was there 100 years ago and George Lucas and James Cameron cheerfully admitted to thoroughly plundering the John Carter books for years. At least they're honest; plenty of others did the exact same thing and didn't even have the decency to admit it. ERB's tales greatly deserved to stand on their own, but that will never happen now due to all the extensive thievery. Also, since this flick bombed there won't be any sequels, so this is the only chance we'll ever get to see his ideas and concepts on screen. Or see them credited to him, I should say.Anyway, anybody who gives ""John Carter"" a chance will be very pleasantly surprised. Spend the extra $$$ and watch the 3D version; it's well worth it. This movie can make you feel like a little kid again if you relax and let it work its magic. I saw it twice already and noticed that there's lots of subtle details that you won't catch the first time around and they make it all greatly enjoyable. Admittedly, this flick is pretty confusing at first and it throws out a lot of complicated mumbo-jumbo, although once it gets rolling it's perfectly fine. For examples of all the intricacy watch the backgrounds and notice the differences between all the individual Tharks (some of ERB's best creations). And my own personal favorite subplot here (you'll have to watch for it closely) is the clearly-seen animosity between loyal, long-suffering Sola and her lifelong bully/tormentor Sarkoja. Every time a Thark commits a tribal offense they get branded and poor Sola has so many brands that there's no more room on her body for another one so she must die for her next transgression! What a wonderful relief to see Sola finally win out in the end! Every one of the Thark motion-capture performances is outstanding, but like I said, Sola is the one I like the best.I was unfamiliar with all the human actors but they're all most excellent. I kept thinking Taylor Kitsch was Johnny Depp but he did a fine job with the title character and everyone else was quite good also. He and Lynn Collins (Dejah Thoris) were in great shape and wore costumes that showed it off. Give ""John Carter"" a chance and you'll have a fun movie experience. It was made by people with a tremendous love and appreciation of ERB, and it shows in every frame. Don't listen to all the negativity and make up your own mind. You'll be glad you did.",John Carter
293,jacobson98,Far Better Than I Expected,8,23 May 2012,"Disappointing box office is not an indicator of the quality of this film - it was far better than I expected. Great photography and special effects, believable characters, lots of action, and a fast moving plot makes the two-hour film fly by. The film explains the minimum the audience needs to understand and moves so fast you never notice the logical inconsistencies, a problem with so many science fiction/fantasy films. The leads are strong and believable and the character actors fabulous and the direction light and fun. Fun is the major word here - difficult to walk away from this film without a smile on your face. The film feels like a really good adaptation of a comic book, but I guess Edgar Rice Burroughs books were the comic books of their day, Princesses of Mars and Tarzan swinging through the jungle and so on. It's obvious that this was the ""origin story"" of what Disney hoped to be a franchise with future sequels. Alas, poor box office has doomed that hope, but what's left is a fun, enjoyable film that is worth a viewing.",John Carter
294,jwardww,"Burroughs, father of Tarzan, imagines quantum entanglement on Mars 22 years before anyone else",10,4 June 2013,"This movie about John Carter, a character from the 1912 novel, A Princess of Mars, is thoroughly satisfying in every way. The idea of entanglement, a single body occupying different spaces simultaneously (in this case, planets) goes far beyond Star Trek's warp drive or transporter to imagine a travel that was much more revolutionary. Even Schroedinger, who refined the concept of entanglement (Verschraenkung), did not articulate his theories until 1935. The novel tells the tale of Dejah Thoris, brilliant and beautiful Princess of Helium, a city on Mars (aka Barsoom). She is rescued by John Carter, a Civil War hero adventurer transported to Mars unwittingly to eventually change everyone's destiny. Lavishly produced and beautifully acted, the movie will go down in history as Disney's finest achievement and best-loved movie. It might take some time, however, to erase initial box office disappointment. It barely broke even on a huge budget. But, like the Wizard of Oz, will endure to become one of America's most popular features. The characters are well developed and interesting. Some of the performances are first rate, including those of Willem Dafoe, Samantha Morton, Lynn Collins and Taylor Kitsch. The warm, three dimensional personalities they create are as resonant and endearing as anything in Twain. That's not something one can say about many science fiction movies. Certainly, Mark Strong's, Matai Shang, will not be exceeded for intelligent villainy or jaded intensity any time soon. You know a performance is great when it seems the actor was also the writer. I encourage anyone to buy the film in Blue Ray to savor the mesmerizing visuals in all their glorious detail. When it comes down to choosing one dream world over another, my vote goes to the movie that features its heroes and heroines ""sailing on light"" in exquisite, dragonfly-like airships.",John Carter
295,nigel-18854,Flawed but entertaining,7,13 April 2017,"This film is not much like Burroughs but I quite like Disney's effort at realising his Martian fantasy adventure stories on screen. Yeah I know that Carter's superhuman abilities are way too exaggerated, flip sake, he's in danger of going into Martian orbit with some of his feats but I suppose that's the influence of the recent superhero flicks. There's also some unnecessary fiddling with Carter's background, the Tars Tarkas/Sola relationship and of course the complete re-working of Deja Thoris. If you're a fan of Burroughs I suppose these divergences form the source can be a bit troublesome but they didn't bother me too much because the film remains pretty entertaining.There are some shortcomings with this flic when compared to Burroughs, the realisation of the landscape and culture is a little too prosaic. And whereas Burroughs's story is one without a moustache twirling villain, the realisation of Sab Than in this film is disappointingly stereotypical. That's probably my main complaint about this flic, it's just a little unambitious, it doesn't quite manage the scope of Avatar, which let's be honest was another Burroughs-Mars inspired story, so the motivations behind the narrative are a little stylised.It's a shame we can't get something like the Burroughs original on screen because it's not just fantasy adventure, it's a trippy almost dream like journey into the realm of Burroughs's imagination.",John Carter

I've seen it twice already since opening day. The production values are A+, but never detract from the story, they're just there as a part of it.

297,limoncella-641-42235,The audience just has to accept way too much.,5,10 March 2012,"While I am as on-the-fence with this film as one can possibly be, I thought the biggest problem with it was that stuff just happened, and we the audience just has to take the films word on it and keep watching.The reason Carter can jump as far as he can and punch people to death in one blow is never really explained, in the novels they explain that Earth's gravity being greater than Mars' makes the inhabitants more muscular than those on Mars, so John Carter being on Mars' lower-gravity surface is built tougher than those already there.Mark Strong's race of people can chameleon themselves into other people? okay...The Tharks have a magic juice that makes those who drink it understand their language completely, speaking and listening, okay...instead of using slow moving creatures that take like three days to get places, why not just tape themselves to John Carter and have him leap across Mars' surface, they'd get there in a fraction of the time.It doesn't occur to John Carter until late in the film that Mars is a better place for him to be than Earth. He's a hunted man with a troubled past back home, a war's going on that he has to endure. But on Mars HE'S A GOD, he can jump for miles and he's stronger than anyone there.We never see John eat or drink anything proper in the movie, there's barely any water on Mars. We can buy that the natives don't need to drink because they're aliens, but John's just a man he needs to drink and Mars looks pretty dry, he surely must get thirsty.Why intercut Carter's backstory randomly halfway through the film in the middle of an action scene, put it at the start of the film so it establishes something about the protagonist. One of the factions on Mars lives on a giant machine that claws its way across the surface of the planet, what if it wandered off a cliff? what if it exploded? the entire city would be decimated with all its people.The Tharks are the most bipolar character in film history. They immediately take an interest in John because of his jumping and strength, so why do they lock him up, shout abuse at him and throw in a gladiators coliseum to die during the film. This guy can jump fifty miles away in a second and punch you to death, why would you mess with him? John Carter should have just abandoned the Tharks and not helped them out considering what they put him through.Carter's feet make blue lights happen... I did not get this scene at all.The biggest one of all is the first thing you ask when he lands on Mars: ""How can he breathe? there are no trees"" This is something carried on from the novel, that was written a hundred years ago, astronomers at the time weren't sure if you could breathe on Mars. After watching so many films over the years that make it clear that humans can't always breathe on foreign worlds (especially those without plant life) it raised a serious question.I honestly can't decide whether or not I liked it, while I was never bored I found myself questioning a lot of things. The action was solid, and the film looks nice.Maybe the source material is dated, maybe it's been spun off by other films like ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" that are so locked into the public conscious we're aware constantly of what we've seen before that it hosts no surprises.As for the films box office performance, it's too early to tell, but if Disney needs at least $400million to earn its money back, it seems like a tall order.Sorry Andrew Stanton, better luck next time. At least you'll always have Wall-e.",John Carter

The screen writers of JOHN CARTER unfortunately made a continuous stream of unbelievably horrid mistakes. The Princess of Mars book this was supposed to have been based on had way more than enough amazing scenes to fill a movie twice over. The writers added in parts of other books and flat out changed and created things. They totally over complicated what had been a grand and majestic story with heroic characters and amazing plot lines. I can understand why people who had not read the books were confused by the disjointed and meandering story-line. But we who had read the books spent half the movie scratching our heads thinking, what they heck was that ? Thurns ? magic amulets ? WHAT the HECK ? The screen writers drank way too much Red Bull and were totally out of control.John Carter was excellent Dejah Thoris was beautiful, mesmerizing and powerful but stop the whining and loose the brit accent. Tars Tarkacs was good. Sola was good. Woola rocked. But the only way for anyone to understand the story would have been to STICK TO THE STORY. NO Thurns, NO amulets, NO magic drink that teaches the barsoomian language. These were ridiculous decisions. AND OMGosh Dejah was NOT a scientist she was a gorgeous petulent Princess of Helium. Please publish who wrote the screen play so I can avoid any film they ever touch. I am sorry but I am already waiting for the remake.

A better job of cinematography, maybe better camera equipment might have enhanced the picture quality but better angles and direction. The special effects really needed improvement, they were good and visually great but you would want to see more. The story is a classic, I did not read the original story but I do suspect there are some unoriginal parts. By watching this movie, you can tell how it inspired many Sci-fi movies today such as Dune or Star Wars or Total Recall. John Carter will satisfy you, off course you will tell to yourself that ""it could be better"" but most Hollywood movies are like that nowadays.",John Carter
300,laclone,Forget the Movie. Read the book.,3,27 July 2014,"This is difficult to review, because almost everything about it, the CGI, locations, actors, and such could have made this a great movie, and really brought visions of ERB's stories to life.But the one thing that doomed this from being what it should/could have been was the script/screenplay. And the kindest words I can think of to describe it are..., another Hollywood Bastardization of an excellent story.The ERB Estate should have filed criminal charges for literary rape this movie did to the original ERB story.Carter and Powell are prospectors/miners in the beginning. They are escaping Indians. No mention of U.S. Cavalry.Everything about Carter's wedding rings, wife & child is sheer Hollywood B.S..The Therns are not even mentioned in the first book, and had nothing whatsoever to do with John Carter's transportation to Mars, his return to Earth, or his return to Mars.The whole River Iss segment has no place in the first book.In short, we have a movie that visually well-presented images described in the books (9 outta 10 stars!), but except for some basic stuff, threw the original books story-line out with the trash (-4 outta 10 stars!).Want to be entertained? Read the book.Want to waste 2 hours? Watch the movie.",John Carter
301,cinemabon,Grew on me,9,2 August 2014,"I confess I did not see the film in the theater. I saw the previews and another special effects extravaganza seemed too much at the time. However, having purchased the film on Blu-ray and watching it at home, I've grown to like the film and even wish they'd shot a sequel. Unfortunately, Disney 's box office did not exceed its high expectations they had for the franchise, so they scrapped all plans. Too bad. I'm actually dying to know what happens next. ""John Carter on Mars"" will go down with the ""Golden Compass"" as movies that could have been possible in the realm of fantasy. The corporate world will only tolerate a blockbuster. Anything else is considered a failure.I would have given the film a ten if not for some of the weak acting roles. If the acting on screen is poor, I generally place that blame on the director's doorstep. However, Stanton wrote the screenplay and directed - a daunting task. With so many special effect shots and cast members that are CGI (the four armed creatures), making a film on this epic scale is not an easy job. Just to complete it in a timely fashion and with this level of quality (sets, costumes, music) pushed the rating from a seven to a nine.",John Carter
302,Bonz99,Fantastic & Wonderful Tale,10,8 May 2019,"NOTE: As of this writing, is on Netflix!Years ago, I read most of Edgar Rice Burroughs. His imagination compares well with Stan Lee or H. Rider Haggard. Burroughs' ""Barsoom"" (Mars) novels are still as readable today as when originally written, over a hundred years ago. Having read ""A Princess of Mars"" more than once back in the day, my mind lit up when a green gent with four arms introduced himself as Tars Tarkas: I almost shouted ""Jeddak of Thark!"". But that wouldn't have gone well in a move theater.For those who have not read Burroughs, this movie stands on its own. For those who have, the revised version of the story told here works equally well. Action, romance, occasional sly humor: it all works. I was not familiar with the two leads, but they were perfectly selected. Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) in particular is the perfect fantasy princess. Hauntingly beautiful, tough as nails, the equal of any man in battle yet as feminine as any woman you can imagine. She should have been at least nominated for Best Actress.I was one of maybe six viewers in the theater (twice!) when originally released -- Disney's promotional staff really fell down on this one; they all should have been fired. I have the DVD, but have seen it three times since it came to Netflix. The movie should have at least been nominated for Oscars in cinematography, costumes, Best Actress and maybe Best Director. But when a major studio loses over $200 mil on a big production, few will be brave enough to nominate it for anything at all. And there won't be any sequels.Highly recommended!",John Carter

But my husband is wrong... Disney CAN make horrible movies. They just proved that with John Carter.Let's start with the cast: Two unknown actors with horrible acting... and the Priness is not even pretty!! Very scanty outfits that leave little to the imagination (this is supposed to be a Disney movie!)... the acting was SO bad... but the movie start off with potential. All the ingredients were there. I quite enjoyed the graphics and special effects actually. But once again, there is no story!! So many plot holes, so many unanswered questions and too many clichés.The story as is you would expect. Tough guy, hurt by love, Princess in distress and an evil King... Do I need to say more? I would have preferred less action or crappier graphics and more story. I had NO interest to the characters. I didn't care if they lived or died for that matter. They were all annoying.I enjoyed Avatar SO much more. There was a simple story there too but at least I was made to actually care for these characters vs. the ones in John Carter. So you have two movies that are very similar in every respect... what is different? The director! I can't believe Andrew Stanton directed this! I loved Wall-E... so what went wrong with John Carter? The actors? So unknown and bad that they had to put Brian Cranston's name up as a lead (in my country) even though his role was only 5 minutes long? From all the characters HE was the only known one here and W. Dafoe of course, except he only does the voice for the Thark.Even the 13 year olds in the theater walked out... what a waste of potential and budget...",John Carter

It's hard to believe the book it's based on, Princess of Mars was written in 1913. Everyone from James Cameron of ""Avatar"" fame, Ray Bradbury, and Carl Sagan, have all attributed much of their inspiration to this landmark book that was Edgar Rice Burrows' first book, even before he wrote Tarzan. Pretty awesome for a guy who was in the pencil sharpener business. Safe for kids. I feel like I'm a serious movie watcher, and I really enjoyed this - I have to confess, I read the whole John Carter of Mars series as a teen, and totally loved them - I'm a 47 year old business owner with a large family, and I'd see it again in an instant.

Apart from a few issues I have with the main villain, I love everything about this movie. It's a delightfully old-fashioned pulp adventure rooted in a rich mythology. Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins were perfectly cast after all, while the green Tharks, and especially Carter's beloved watchdog Woola, make fascinating and endearing alien creatures. Michael Giacchino's music soars, but is also enchanting in its tender, quieter moments. Director Andrew Stanton will probably never get the recognition he deserves; this was a tricky movie to pull off, and I for one think he did Burroughs proud.One of the year's best movies.",John Carter
307,bcbell79,"A valiant attempt at Edgar Rice Burroughs sci-fi classic, The Princess of Mars, but is not the epic film I was hoping for...",7,10 March 2012,"John Carter is a valiant attempt at Edgar Rice Burrough's sci-fi classic The Princess of Mars, but is not the epic film I was hoping for...Period.I have read The Princess of Mars several times over the years. I love the book. As one would imagine, I was very excited when I heard that it was going to be made into a movie. Sadly, this movie has gone through development hell for close to a decade and perhaps the time took its toll. In 2004, Paramount owned the rights and Robert Rodriguez (Sin City) was attached to direct, and then Kerry Conran (Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow), and then Jon Favreau (Iron Man). And then, finally, in 2007 Disney got the rights back and hired on Pixar's Andrew Stanton (WALL-E) to direct this science fiction classic.Stanton's vision of Burroughs beloved book is flawed, yet still an enjoyable film. The film opens on Earth in the 1890's. John Carter (played convincingly by Taylor Kitsch, Friday Night Lights) is a Civil War Solider who gets chased into a cave by a group of Indians. Here is where he gets transported to Mars to awaken only to find a race of green, 12 foot tall, 4-armed aliens known as Thark's. John quickly realizes he has super hero like powers due to Mars' change in gravity. He can jump hundreds of feet and has the strength of a dozen men, and this impresses one of the Thark's greatest warriors, Tars Tarkas (voiced by Willem Dafoe, Boondock Saints).Tarkas brings John back to their alien city, and John starts making friends (and enemies) quickly. Soon there is complex political story involving the other 'human-like' alien race who control most of Mars, which is where the genuinely beautiful Princess (Lynn Collins, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) comes in. She is set to marry the villainous Sab Than (Dominic West, The Wire) but wants nothing to do with him and eventually falls for our hero, John Carter.One of my favorite characters from the book, Woola (a six legged creature with dog-like tendencies) who becomes a sort of guardian to Carter, was a standout character in the film as well! Still, I really wanted to love this movie... I didn't.I was surprised at how many things were changed (seemingly for no real reason) from book to film. John Carter can still be considered a faithful adaption, but it could have been better. The visual effects are absolutely stunning, and perhaps the best reason for seeing this film on the big screen. They convey a beautiful alien world, and (animated) characters that interact with the live action flawlessly. The 3D was also a nice treat. It actually added noticeable depth to the world of Mars. Unfortunately, I found the movie somewhat slow, and at times, uninteresting except for the striking visuals. With that said, the film does have some great action sequences featuring alien on alien combat.Overall, John Carter is a valiant attempt at Edgar Rice Burrough's sci-fi classic The Princess of Mars, but is not the epic film I was hoping for. If you have read the book or love sci-fi or big visual effects movies, it's worth checking out on the big screen. Otherwise, wait for the DVD. I'm sure it will be out in just a few months!",John Carter
308,chakotay-70770,Edgar Rice Burroughs himself would be Proud of this movie!!!,10,15 April 2018,"One of the reviews here said it all and took the words right out of my mouth.
I raise my hat to the reviewer who goes by the name ""Metacognizant"".
Rather than repeat that review - which you can find yourself - let me add this:
In my youth, I managed to acquire and read the entire set of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs known as ""The Martian Series"".
The first novel is entitled ""A Princess of Mars"".Anyway, I was always disappointed that nobody in Hollywood ever brought this swashbuckling epic to the cinema screen.
Imagine my astonishment and delight when ""John Carter"" (the movie) surfaced in 2012.
The denigrating and scathing reviews that I waded through - at the time - made my heart sink.
Nevertheless, I rented the movie and steeled myself to judge ""John Carter"" from what was projected onscreen, before my own eyes.
By the time the end credits started scrolling, my teeth were gnashing at all the critics who besmirched this magnificent movie...
What I thought of them - and still do - is truly unprintable here....take my word for it!!Apparently, Hollywood critics and Hollywood film producers can't ""smell"" a good movie from a bad one, anymore.
Well guys, I have not, and if anybody in Hollywood wants a fellow who CAN smell a good movie from a bad one...I'm available!!
Remember Kurt Russell in ""The Barefoot Executive"" (1971).....and how a Chimp could ""smell"" good stuff that studio execs could not....
Sound familiar?If you have not yet immersed yourself in this marvelous masterpiece, what are you waiting for?
Why not rent ""John Carter"" and see for yourself who's right: the critics or the positive reviewers:- such as Metacognizant ?
You will have the time of your life.....why else would I rate this movie as 10/10 ??",John Carter
309,barryweir,Criminally underrated,7,24 September 2012,"I am pleased to see so many positive user reviews of this movie on here. Why this movie was a box office failure is really beyond. Perhaps it is the cost of an ignorant movie going public who have no idea of the roots of John Carter and it's influence on not just the big movies of today like Avatar and Star Wars, but the science fiction of days gone by like Flash Gordon, so they write this off as a rip off of other movies. On the contrary, the John Carter books were the stories that started them all, just as Jules Verne started the science fiction themes that would one day give rise to the likes of Star Trek and Back to the Future.The film provides a god and faithful adaption of A Princess of Mars, the first of the John Carter books from Edwin Rice Burroughs. The direction is skilled, the special effects masterful, the score fantastic and, most importantly, it has the entertainment factor in spades (I forbid anyone not to fall in love with Woola!).Baffled as to why this was not a commercial success. Like many movies, I suspect that this may generate a cult following as years go by. I hope that Disney take the opportunity to read the user reviews on here and take note of the potential for this to get a long term following (and one more deserving of cult status than the likes of Avatar). A sequel of the same quality or better would be very much on this movie goer's list of must sees.",John Carter

To me who made a movie is not a view criterion. What matters is how entertaining/illuminating/ etc. etc. a movie is and not my bias against the producers. And as far as I can tell, in my humble opinion, John Carter is highly entertaining, beautiful to watch, fantastic landscapes, great action, decent acting and a touch of menace, not to mention a gorgeous princess. Also the 3D effects where magnificent. I wouldn't compare it to Avatar or Star Wars, since all are great in their own right, even though both have been greatly inspired by it.Besides that everything else has already been said about this movie (that the is story based on (rather closely) ""Princess of Mars"" which is the All-Father of modern Sci Fi adventures written over 100 years ago by Edgar Rice Burroghs).I highly recommend this movie to all adventure and action fans and wider audiences.",John Carter
312,Homersan,John Carter .... what was that name again?,5,19 May 2012,"How does one review a movie, which has the unfavorable label of being the worst flop in movie history... What went wrong, how did it go wrong and who's to blame??They had all the right ingredients: big budget, good director, original book series as base, etc...But sometimes, even when you mix all the right ingredients the wrong way... you might not like the taste of it afterwards.I've just seen the movie at home, but I'd like to share my feelings about it when I first heard of the movie:I saw a red poster with the Disney logo on it, and the words: JOHN CARTER. So I said to myself: Is Disney making a new animation movie without me knowing it? I mean what or who the h*ll is John Carter supposed to be? FAILURE 1: Choose I title that means something to the public. Then I saw some footage, in the form of stills and a trailer... Ouch... Who was the prince of persia wannabe? They were talking about him like he was this fitness buff or something. Sorry, he's fit.. I'll give him that.. but have any of these idiots watched thor, captain America, X-men... I mean those guys trained their asses off to look big. This guy can't even walk... all he does is jump and look weird. FAILURE 2: Choose your leading man better!! Then the trailer... I just got shudders all over. Bad CGI... probably cost a lot but seemed soooo fake. Even the Matrix had better looking jumps in them and this was in 1999 for crying out loud. And what was with the white monkey type giants??? I don't care who wrote, created or made them... they just plain sucked. Can't say anything good about them. FAILURE 3: Know how the market your movie!!!And then the movie itself... I thought it started of rather well, until they went to the mars/barsoom stuff. That was horrible. Like a B version of Avatar (which I also didn't like). Of course there will be an audience for this...probably eating popcorn and drinking coke while doing so, but it's not for me. I can see why it bombed at the box office...Still gave it a five as the leading girl is quite hot...",John Carter

The action is good, the scenery, and a bit of humour. The movie is well paced too. But then, when i left the theatre, i felt there was something missing. The movie has no soul.

316,lekavalio,Joyride!!! Pure and simple,10,16 January 2017,"What a delight this movie is! I've seen it countless times and it never gets old. This is entertainment at its purest form -not an easy thing to come by these days.Visuals: The CGI here is excellent! Stunning settings and very life-like alien creatures. Special effects used with good taste. Perhaps the strongest visual appeal of the movie for me is the use of colour. The end result is strongly reminiscent of technicolor aesthetic and this is even reflected on the film's original poster!Plot: The characters are very believable if somewhat plain (as expected in works of pulp fiction). That simplicity is delightful however as not all movies need to carry some hidden philosophical meaning. The script is clean-cut and unpretentious and keeps a very good pace while managing to avoid PLOT HOLES that can really ruin a movie of this type. At the same time it manages to include some very original plot elements and twists and it even avoids completely linear narrative -so there is something that will appeal to the most demanding viewer while it won't throw the casual ones off. Good performances both from actors and CGI and the leading stars are very likable!The bottom line: Stunning visuals, great performances and a sturdy plot; a perfect mix between comical, dramatic that will also thrill any true adventure lover. A great movie to watch alone or with company for a pizza night in. I really wish I see more movies like it in the near future! A sequel would be most welcome too.",John Carter
317,My_Opinion-245-920801,"John Carter, had imagination, action and stunning CGI environments.",7,23 May 2012,"John Carter, had imagination, action and stunning CGI environments. However it seems the majority of the movie reviewers came down negatively in their reviews of this major motion picture. The resourcefulness, required to bring the Martian landscape to life, should be noted. It was done with creativity and had a life of its' own. There were very few lulls in the action sequences; it was steady and done tastefully. The CGI Martian themselves looked tangible and were believable. If you were to judge this movie on the merit of strictly plot, it would fail miserably. However, in defense of John Carter, one only need look as far back as Battleship, Transformers and countless other entries in the Sci-Fi genera, to fully understand it is not always all about the plot. Although a properly written script works wonders. There are few Sci-Fi movies that have both a resounding plot and effects to boot, such as Star-Wars, Aliens and perhaps even Avatar. Considering all these factors, John Carter was nowhere as bad as all the reviewers would lead you to believe. Yes, the plot was weak, but most people do not go into watching this type of film expecting Sophie Choice or Chariots of Fire. This Hollywood block buster delivered what it advertised an exciting action laden movie with, imaginative environments and plenty of CGI.",John Carter
318,a-ozornin,"Boring, non-inspiring, dull and grey movie",2,24 March 2012,"The success of Avatar keeps the heads of the world movie corporations awake at night. Cameron managed to create another world, populate it with unusual yet charismatic creatures, create a conflict with humans, drop the main character in and let us watch the development of the story. What sounds simple in theory found a great response in peoples' hearts, allowing Avatar to take in a lot of profit and leaving fans waiting for the sequel. John Carter is so obviously trying to be the second Avatar, it is impossible to escape from comparisons. And comparisons are, unfortunately for John Carter, not in its favor.The movie is based on the book ""Princess of Mars"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, being yet another example of how the movie industry is unable to come up with its own original plots. But that is not a problem, particularly given the fact that Burroughs is thought to have inspired Lucas and Cameron. The problem is that Disney decided to make the film, reducing sharply all the harsh parts to fit into the ""family movie"" category. John Carter lost immensely because of this. The storyline is dry, straightforward and simple. It is predictable if you watched any Disney movie at all. Princess? Check. Misfit-but-good-person? Check. Outsider? Check. Cute animal? Check. Evil super-powerful genius? Check. Disney's production line is working day and night to produce cliché movies.But even tedious storyline does not mean the movie is bad. There still is some hope – in action part, in smart dialogues, in carefully drawn characters But leave your hopes: action is little and still pretty boring. Dialogues are dull, silly and, worse of all, intolerably long. Coupled with predictable storyline, long dialogues make it a pretty big nail into the coffin of John Carter. The storyline jumps around almost randomly, leaving huge logical gaps and holes in the plot. The characters are there as if only to play their part in the main storyline: they have no past and no future. You are left to guess their intentions and motives. The movie is boring, the characters are plain and tasteless. Even Mark Strong fails to bring the arch-enemy to life despite his huge portfolio of evil characters. Smart, ingenious in the book, here the character looks a bit clumsy and definitely not scary. Other actors understandably fail as well, with Lynn Collins playing top-model rather than princess, with Taylor Kitsch playing emotionless wooden soldier rather than opportunistic adventure-seeker. Willem Dafoe lent his voice to Tars Tarkas, but this four-handed king is opaque in his motives as well as all the other characters, making it impossible to enliven him.Now onto the technical part. It is well-known fact that John Carter has the budget of $250m. The question is where all the money was spent. 3D does not bring any extra emotions as there are no particular effects based on it. Compare it with Avatar or Hugo, and you will ask why one would want to use 3D in the first place. The Martian land is the best representation of the movie as a whole: plain and boring, grey and dry. The movie fails to impress with CGI and looks more like Star Wars Episode 4 than modern age technological breakthrough.VERDICT: Boring, non-inspiring, dull and grey movie; Pale shadow of the underlying book.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com",John Carter
319,livstrongeva,John Carter's fairytale,6,25 August 2013,"Mars was always the interesting planet as I remember. Where do aliens come from? Mars. In what planet could there be water? Mars. Where are astronauts from the movies sent to make a new life? Mars. What's the planet people are sent to if there is trouble on Earth (in the movies)? Mars.What do we know about Mars? Sure, there's Curiosity, roaming its lands and sending examples from it. Scientifically, we know a lot. But we could know more. And so if there's a place for mystery, stories unfold.John Carter is a soldier from Earth. Accidentally he gets sent to the Mars (or Barsoom how the Martians call it) where he has the ability to jump great lengths (probably because of his earthly bone structure). And he attracts attention. A princess wants to use him to save her city and kingdom. A king wants to use him to protect another kingdom. And he just wants to go home.Personally, I would like to talk about two things in this movie. First one is science fiction. I mean, a movie about Mars always promises something mysterious, but an entire nation? That's just what I wanted. Sure, it's not Avatar with the most wonderful graphics, but still. Science fiction just gets into people's mind, because it's something you know and something mysterious at the same time. As with Mars, if we would search information about it, we would find a lot, but that doesn't mean that people can't use their imagination and fill in the empty slots. And that is just so amazing.The second thing is the human nature to help. And yes, I am aware of millions/billions of news articles talking about scumbags and so on, but let's not forget that the news usually focus on negative sides of human nature. What compels people to help others? Is it just goodwill? I believe that under everything we are told the true human nature is to help out, and that is why after some time John Carter does that as well. We see a man who is closed from everything, who felt pain and gave up on world open up again and feel joy.I'm not saying, that John Carter's plot is really deep: princess in trouble, guy saves her, becomes her prince. Sort of like a fairytale. Only that it's happening on Mars. Nonetheless, it's a nice and simple story with beautiful effects and fighting scenes. It's a science fiction fairytale.",John Carter

I don't agree with the reviews that claim '...seen it all before' – which is like saying Saving Private Ryan had already been done to death, just because it happened to be a WWII movie about Americans fighting Nazis. John Carter is a throwback to the cliff-hangers that used play in theaters until the end of the 60's.

Edgar ""Ned"" Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara) receives news that his uncle John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) mysteriously dies for unknown reasons. John's attorney hands Ned over his personal journal for him to read and hopes that it'll explain his uncle strange behavior and death. Then the film goes back in 1868, when John Carter mysteriously got suck into Mars. He now has the ability to jump high with no problem. He then encounters Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe), a strange alien with four arms and friendly, takes him to his village. Meanwhile Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins), a Princess from Helium, is force to get marry with Sab Than (Dominic West) by her father because the cities of Helium and Zodanga have been at war for a thousand years and the only way to end the conflict is for them to get marry.Long story short, John Cater had been under development since 1930. Originally it was going to be animated, but Walt Disney himself decided to postpone the project due to budget concerns. From there several studios were trying to figure out how to adopt the novel onto the big school. Eighty years later, John Carter is finally here, but unfortunately the results aren't great. Andrew Stanton, known for directing Finding Nemo and Wall-E, was given an impossible task; write the script and directing it. While the plot is interesting, it ultimately fails because the pacing was extremely slow. Several scenes were unnecessary and pointless to watch. In other words, it should've been cut out. There is good acting, but that doesn't save the movie at all. Several action sequences were good, but it ultimately falls flat because it wasn't intense, making it unmemorable. Now here's the sad part, if you want to get to know the characters, the writer responsibility to develop them. This film doesn't even have any character development, except for John Carter himself. Now I know people are going to argue with me about this, so I decided to give you guys a simple question for you to answer, Describe the following characters without saying what they look, what kind of costume they wore, or what their profession or role in the movie was. Describe this to me or your friends like they ain't ever seen the movie. Good luck with that. The novel came out in 1912 and keep in mind that at the time, science fiction was new to the world. In today's world were used to it. The issue with John Cater is that the book is 100 years old and several of well known sci-fi films or novels like The Star Wars Saga, Avatar, Blade Runner, Cowboys and Aliens, Superman, etc. had taken some of the ideas (like his powers, the story, the creatures, etc.) from the novel and made it better. John Carter came out at the wrong time in this era. Now if the movie would have to come out in the 1930s, it probably it would have been revolutionary. 3D is pointless since it was converted, which means that some parts will be blurry. For a Disney film, the level of violence was extremely high. I have never seen chopping limps and heads on a Disney film. Looks like Disney is not a friendly company after allLet me make myself clear, despite most of my negative thoughts, John Carter is not a bad movie, but it could've been better if only they fixed the issues that I just addressed. While some parts were entertaining, in the end it isn't watchable in theaters. I will say this; if you still want to see this movie then I would wait and rent the movie.C-",John Carter
325,sourmanflint,Just a great movie,9,20 July 2012,"This is not going to be a long review, there are some great reviews on here and I think they have said all I wanted and more. The thing to hold onto is that despite all the negative hype in the worldwide press, this is one heck of a great movie. I have no idea why any film studio would want to distance themselves from this film, it is fresh in a time when fresh is a very rare thing in the movies. Avatar managed it in heaps and so does John Carter. The story is grand and intriguing, the characters are solid and believable, and the CGI is so good you forget about it. This will become one of my favourite all time movies, it is up there amongst the very best of the genre. Don't believe the hype.. this is a must see movie!!",John Carter
326,jfwhelan,"It's not the book, but it's still good.",7,19 May 2012,"I fell in love with Barsoom as a boy. I dreamt of going to Mars and finding my own Deja Thoris. And as I lived my life growing into each new age, these stories have stayed with me. Now as I find myself approaching my sixth age, as Shakespeare would have it, finally I find there has been a creditable attempt to bring my childhood hero to the silver screen.The makers of this film clearly have some love and respect for the original; I find much of the heart of the stories that I loved in this film, but inwardly I weep that the attempt was not more honest and true to the source.Too much was attempted here, much was changed, unnecessary complexity was introduced with insufficient back story and to what end? There was no need; had they followed the original story, they would have had a stronger film with a much easier and more coherent plot.Why bring in Therns at all or the pilgrimage to Issus, this is all from the second book 'The Gods of Mars' and in it the Therns are anything but super-scientists and instead effete petty charlatans.Still I enjoyed this film and John Carter and Deja Thoris were surprisingly well cast, but it has to be said that Deja Thoris Princess of Helium and granddaughter of Tardos Mors would sooner take her own life than run from anything that she considered her duty.My abiding sorrow is that in the end this film missed its mark. I cannot help feeling that had there been less embellishment and more actual story-telling, then just maybe this film would have been more of a success and then perhaps there would have been a franchise That way I would get to visit Barsoom again.",John Carter
327,stratowing,Fantastic but should have been trilogy,9,18 March 2012,"I haven't been to a theater-release movie in quite a while, because I suppose at my age (48) you begin to see the repeat formula in most of what Hollywood studios create. They all seem alike now, and 'bored' is how I exit the theater. I suspect those of us who grew up on Lucas & Speilburg are all waiting for the next StarWars. No - Avatar wasn't it: ground-breaking movie visually, but not nearly as expansive a tale. Enter John Carter. I saw the ad on TV and thought nothing of it. ""Another cliché formula flick thrown together with big CG armies clashing, and less-than-interesting dialog/story lines going on"" : so I thought. I was wrong. At the risk of committing great ""blasphemy"", I dare say this movie actually had the potential of being *the* next StarWars. DARN they missed an opportunity! I walked into the theater barely willing to give this movie (or *any* movie) a chance, so I was the proverbial ""tough crowd"" - but the acting, visuals, and cool story drew me in anyway. By the time the wedding scene occurred, I was thinking 'darn - they rushed this movie -waaay too fast'. It should have been 2 movies or possibly a trilogy. I'm not going to blab on, but I don't post unless a movie is really bad, or really good. This one was really good, to me, and it kinda grows on you, because instead of leaving the theater bored, I left thinking about the story. *That* is a good sign. Film Score: Great! Character development: very good Directing: very good Acting: very good Story uniqueness: (based on ERB 'Princess of Mars' - very good) Visuals: very good!! PS> I also did not look for any ""symbolism"" while watching; just enjoyed the story for what it was, so if there are political messages in there, I wasn't aware of them.(Sometimes films' symbolic political messages are rather 'overt', sometimes less overt. I'd prefer to enjoy a sci-fi adventure than to be manipulated by politics during a movie. JC of Mars seems to be straight-forward entertainment w/ no bs.)",John Carter

332,jcs_stanley,Visually thrilling and well realised.,8,18 March 2012,"John carter has got to be one of the visual spectacles of 2012, with much of it's combat scenes being reminiscent of Star Wars (a franchise that came long after the original ""Barsoom"" series was first published) However John Carter is a able to to such scenes in it's own unique way so that though they resemble what Lucas did later in the 70s, it creates creatures, Cultures and Airships that only the people of Mars could have dreamed off from hulking White Apes to an imaginative mash-up of Traditional bladed weaponry of the ancient past and Sci-fi technologies.The film takes a while to get going (Such as the firsts scenes with Carter on earth) but once he gets to Mars I can assure you you will regret nothing because the Filmprovides us with a more fascinating mythos than Avatar's.The plot is decent to an extent but is pushed along effortlessly by the amount of talent that's involved in the performances regardless of whenever it's a savage Thark or Taylor KItsch as He-man (I therefore look forward to seeing him in ""Battleship"" when it finally hits land) Did I mention that Edgar Rice Burroghs himself his more or less involved in the beginning and end of the story. I wont say any more for fear of spoilers but I will say it is all really interesting that he appears in the film himself even though the ""The Raven"" has done similar thing this year.",John Carter
333,torchwood949-166-552404,"The Book Was Ahead Of Its Time, The Movie However Is Not",4,11 March 2012,"For films such as John Carter, you have to accept them for what they are. Unfortunately John Carter fails on the aspects it hopes to appeal too. Based on the 1917 book 'A Princess Of Mars' written by Edgar Rice Burroughs it stars up and coming actor Taylor Kitsch as John Carter himself, a civil war veteran who is mysteriously transported to Mars and quickly involved in an on going war that the planet faces.Coming straight from directing animated Pixar films such as 'Finding Nemo' and 'Wall-E' Andrew Stanton hasn't quite grasped how to deal with a live action film. Mars is host to a wide array of human-esque characters and a large amount of CGI aliens known as the Thark. Through his directing he appears to have given the effects more life and personality than any of the human counterparts, which remain fairly flat and unremarkable. This makes around half of the film fairly interesting while the other half lies flat and dormant. Kitsch tries his hardest to bring himself as a charismatic and relatable character but the dreary cast keeps him back. Dominic West poses as a bland villain along side Mark Strong who demonstrated in 'Tinker Tailor Solider Spy' that he can be a highly qualified actor when given the right role.The acting isn't the only problem here. The plot has a lot of meat to it but that doesn't mean that it's in anyway interesting. It meanders and drags switching between all the various different factions and with the human characters being as plain as they are it makes their scenes extremely un-engaging. For those who haven't read the book the story will feel like it's swaying all around the place. An unnecessary plot line involving Carters nephew on Earth feels completely out of place and only features at the very beginning and the very end meaning that half way on through the time on Mars you will have forgotten all about it making the ending not as satisfying as it should have been. A forced romance plot line weaves its way through the plot as well that makes for some truly awkward and wooden acting between Kitsch and Lynn Collins who plays the Princess of one of Mars cities known as Helium. The only strand of the film that is somewhat compelling is the involvement with Thark's where again Stanton demonstrates he's best suited with animation.A Princess Of Mars heavily influenced many science fiction films that exist today, without Burroughs books there wouldn't be films such as 'Star Wars', 'Avatar' or 'Stargate'. The only problem is the film is now in a world where said films do exist so it makes a hard time for the audience not to compare it to such films. The desert planet is reminiscent of Tatooine from 'Star Wars', the Thark resemble the civilization from 'Avatar' and the soundtrack boasts that of the original 'Stargate' film. The fact that these films have happened makes John Carter all the more pointless for existing. Its time has passed and as a result won't flow as well in this day and age.That being said there are things to like about John Carter. The first portion of Mars is entertaining as Carter attempts to get used to the environment and the species on the planet. It builds for some genuine interest and excitement. But as soon as the rest of the cast is introduced, unfortunately spirals downhill. Another positive factor is the set pieces. Because they are so far apart they provide a refreshing change of pace. There's a particular standout scene in which Carter is fighting an array of enemies but the film also cuts back to a previous part of his life on Earth, interchanging between the two scenes. Unfortunately though these positives don't bring cause for a recommendation to see John Carter. It's bland, slow, boring and has a thick and overflowing plot that won't appeal to a large variety of the audience. The book was way ahead of its time, the film however is not.",John Carter
334,Captain_Roberts,Breathtaking,9,4 March 2012,"We just saw a pre-release showing of this movie and I had to pick my jaw up off the floor a few times. The movie is simply stunning. While there may be small details to niggle at for the most die-hard Burroughs fans, this is ""inspired by"" a Princess of Mars, it isn't a straight adaptation. The movie is a whirlwind of amazing visuals, powerful dialog and soul-wrenching storytelling.I'd had high hopes that this movie would live up to the hype surrounding it. It surpasses it, the hype doesn't even come close. From beginning to end, this movie focuses on story, and expands on a great story with stunning effects as opposed to just using great FX in place of solid storytelling.It also has one of the strongest pieces of non-verbal storytelling outside of Up.Do not miss this film. Do see it in the theaters. Do see it in 3D.You will not be disappointed.

335,hasekamp,The book is better,5,12 March 2012,"OK. I'll do it the other way around as on another movie site: The movie is nice to watch and the visual effects are good. Hence a 7. BUT I cannot understand why the infamous Hollywood script writers had to change so much compared to the book. Now we are left with a story in which hardly anything is being explained: How can John Carter understand the Martians? How do the Martians live (especially the green Tharks)? What kind of a person (""creature"") is Dejah Thoris? How are her thoughts about John Carter? Why do the Heliumites live so different from the Tharks? How is it possible that on Mars there is air, so that life is possible at all there? These and many, many other questions remain unanswered. All these questions are being answered in the book. Now, why has this information been omitted from the script? Also the interesting relationship between John Carter and Tars Tarkas remains a closed book (Why and how do they change from enemies to close friends?). What remains is a state-of-the-art movie with lots of action, that is a feast for the eye, but in which much of the background remains unclear. After writing all this, I have changed my vote to a six. It is such a shame that the real story remains untold.",John Carter
336,robertobasilico,Avatar/Prince of Persia mix?,7,19 March 2012,"I'm just back from an IMAX 3D experience with John Carter, the latest Disney movie. I am pretty happy with it especially thanks to the last 5 minutes which turned out to made ALL the entire movie making sense, I confess I was about to be pretty disappointed if the movie would have been end with Carter marrying the Mars princess.As I say in the title, to me this movie was nothing more than a mix between Avatar and the previous Disney movie Prince of Persia and I'll tell you why.AVATAR: Not only the aliens pretty much look like the avatar ones, but even the Center of their religion is a huge tree, which this time is DRY and the space shift again looked like the avatar ones.PRINCE OF PERSIA: the Idea of the trip in the desert of John Carter and the Princess of Mars, not only that but the setting of their relationship is pretty much the same: that kind of powerful man who treats his girl mean sometimes but in the end loves her. John Carter character was more Man rather than Jake Gyllenhal I have to say though.About the department: Photography: nice and well done. I liked the 3d and the panoramic view of the scenes. I would say something more could have been done to make the fighting scenes more entertaining.7/10music: honest and pleasant, I don't remember it so probably was not that special, but at the same time, it never get out of theme and stays perfectly in line with the moods of the scenes.6/10costumes and locations: I liked the Roman style of the martians, and the simplicity of Carter one. The aliens were nice looking, I would say they look like the Street Fighter Indian warrior. and locations were OK, again nothing that special, but OK.7/10editing: good and simply, straight to the point, I would give an 8 to it because of the nice interlace of the first and last scenes. the ones of the earth. I liked that.8/10director: I would have expect more from the actors at some point, and also some camera shot could have been better.7/10I don't really want to continue forever with this analytic thing, let just say that I have to admit at one point I kinda feel asleep, so don't expect a master piece. It is a nice movie, not a MUST SEE, so look around, there might be other worthwhile seeing. Disney could do better I'm sure.",John Carter

This film is a classic Disney film and is very good to watch. The only thing I would say is that the first 30 minutes kind of dragged on a bit.Lynn Collins was very sexy in this film and with blue eye contact lenses. As for the girls, Taylor Kitsch has a superb physique and 8 pack.I don't want to go into the movie too much as you probably have read every story in the book online.Watch the 2d version.

My expectations were not very high but I still wanted to see a good movie. I did not get to see a good movie today, but not a bad one either.Definitely the strongest elements of the film were the fantastic special effects. Almost everything, from the Tharks to the weird and vicious ape-like creatures, looked great. But all the work they put into the design of the film and getting half of the cast of Rome did not help them, because in the end, it was not enough for us to have a good movie.I really liked James Purefoy and Ciaran Hinds. Especially Purefoy, who I think had a lot of fun with this film. At the opposite pole we have Lynn Collins, who played the role of Dejah Thoris. I didn't really like her and she did not express any emotion whatsoever. Taylor Kitsch didn't give a breakthrough performance but he was not bad at all in the film. He really tried to give it his best.One of the main problems of the film was the script. I have not read the novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs but it seemed to me that there were a couple of plot holes. And above all that, the screenplay was straight out flat at some points. I got the impression that lines were thrown in just to cover a gap.I don't want to give anybody the impression that this is a bad film, because it's not.

340,wildwesth,An Epic Legend Edgar Rice Burroughs would be very very proud of,10,9 March 2012,"This film is remarkable on so very many levels. Yes, the trailers suggest modest expectations, but the film sweeps you along from start to finish. The depth of the characters, and the pathos of their lives, the brutal but pragmatic and honorable Tharks, the romance between Carter and Dejah Thoris, the beautiful Keith Thompson style machines, the steam- punk Victorian ships, and the epic battles all combine to create a wonderful and sweeping saga. Where Avatar painted in beautiful but broad colors and shock value, using cartoon bad guys and innocent nature-good guys, leading to horrible violence and violent vengeance; where Star Wars had camp and deeply rooted philosophy; John Carter of Mars tells a remarkable and very human tale of the emergence of a leader and the salvation of two cultures. I have read reviews trying to compare this film to Avatar and Star Wars, and you can see elements. But those comparisons are entirely wrong and misguided. You might as well compare Saturday morning cartoons with Shakespeare. If you have read the Barsoom series, you see elements of John Carter in these other tales, but only weakly reflected. In John Carter you get the full treatment. There is no holding back. The violence is very very bloody, just like the book. Today, in today's cinema, the story can be told just as Edgar Rice Burroughs did, without apology, with nobility.The characters are much more finely drawn, especially Tars Tarkas and Sola. Their story is deeply moving, but so is the romance between Carter and Thoris. The photography, the scenery and the pacing reflect the work of David Lean in Lawrence of Arabia. Stanton is truly the heir to David Lean, and we are very excited to see the films he will be making in the years ahead.This is the Lawrence of Arabia of fantasy sci-fi, and that is a fair comparison.John Carter is an instant classic, to be watched over and over again, enjoyed, discussed and remembered.

344,doktorf,Made by someone who loves the book.,9,10 March 2012,"There are some spoilers.O.k. We resolve that to a fan of the books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, no movie treatment of A Princess of Mars can be perfect or even close to perfect. The best we can hope for is that the film be made by someone who lives and breaths the material as we do and honors it properly within the limitations they are constrained by, be they financial, cultural or simply those imposed by the medium.POM was published 101 years ago. It is in many ways an Edwardian relic that is bound to be difficult to adapt to 21st century sensibilities. Further, it is freighted with a century of expectations of what it should be and what changes to the story or setting would be unacceptable. In this version there are what I would have considered major changes. John Carter does not arrive on Barsoom baby naked. Dejah Thoris is not a sheltered young thing, all but defenseless. Here she is a scientist and a trained warrior. The Therns are a major presence here when in the books they didn't show up until later in the series. I could go on, there are many divergences from the book.The difference between this and the 2009 Asylum feature are not about money to spend so much as they are about understanding the story and the characters and what made generations love them. The difference is that Andrew Stanton gets it and the makers of the 2009 film simply didn't. Someone who gets the essentials of A Princess of Mars, could produce it on a bare stage with minimal make up and make the story work.This is finally the film that needed to be made of ERB's first and greatest work.",John Carter
345,Deimos-remus,An expensive mess,1,3 March 2013,"I only have a few things to say about John Carter. I felt that this was a perplexing property for Disney to pick up, as it is not a children's story. The movie had almost no faithfulness to its source material, the accomplished John Carter of Mars series by Edgar Rice Burroughs. From what I can tell from the books and other users reviews, it barely scratched the surface of the novels. One thing that really irks me about this steaming pile called a movie is that the director Andrew Stanton felt the need to say that Farnk Frazetta, the visual artist and master painter responsible for the look of John Carter, the one who has defined what Barsoom looks like, is dated and cheesy. Frank's art is timeless, and I felt that none of his vision was shown through, which was unfortunate.Now for the plot and acting. When I heard that Kitsch signed on to play John Carter, I immediately lost interest. Not only did he not look the part, he acted terribly in it, just as everyone else did. The lines were contrived, the dialogue and settings were watered down, and the movie needed some serious grit to it. It being Disney however, they couldn't do much to remedy that, even though they've made darker films, Hunchback of Notre Dame comes to mind. The characters had no depth or development to them whatsoever, events happened too quickly.The editing such a mess, I can say this is the most annoyed I've been watching a film. The way scenes rolled into each other was way too abrupt, and being an artist myself, the way certain scenes were composed annoyed me as well, like actors faces being cropped just below the top of the head, creating weird tangents for example. I can appreciate the work that goes into a film like this, but the finished product doesn't display that work, and didn't impress me, visually or through its story and characters.Overall, a waste of my time, and a contrived mess. For being a huge fan of Sci-Fi masterpieces like Ridley Scott's Alien or Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, this was a horribly mediocre film in a genre that needs to be jump-started with fresh ideas. Because I disliked it so much, I actually rather glad that it was such a commercial failure, I saw that coming from a mile away.",John Carter
346,pcongleton-1,"Beautiful, but ridiculous!",6,20 March 2012,"Seeing this film definitely makes me want to look into the character's original roots, but not for reasons you might think. Edgar Rice Burroughs, the man who brought us Tarzan, also created the story of John Carter of Mars. He also ends up, through clever writing, being John Carter's fictional nephew Edgar ""Ned"" Rice Burroughs in the film, in fact, the story of John Carter has been around for 100 years in various forms or another. The reason I want to do more research on this character, even though I have heard of the story and even read one of the comics 30 years ago, is I really do not know enough to do a fair comparison. My issue is; I couldn't see any credibility in rookie-director, Andrew Stanton's depiction of taking a man out of 1881 Earth and sending him to an alien world that he could never even imagined. I mean, hell, they barely had light bulbs in 1881. I want to see how far Burroughs took this, because that is what was killing me with the movie, because I could not accept what was being fed to me. It's a shame too, because the movie starts out good.We get a majestic introduction to what is happening on the planet Mars and then we end up in the Wild West in 1881 America. We get treated to some good comedy in the guise of Bryan Cranston, as a Union Colonal who locks up John Carter in jail and has to pursue him once he escapes, only to be caught in the same trouble that John has to deal with at that moment. Even the way John gets to Mars is sell-able and with great detail they even depict for us John painstakingly trying to adjust to the planet's gravitational pull, that, ala' Superman, gives John enhanced strength and ability and thus makes him an object that the local species find interesting. I even had no problem with the insect-like CGI'd green Tharks that capture John initially. As the film went on I realized that there is no way this film has sold to me the idea that if this story really had happened it would look like this. The credibility is not there. As I have said a million times before, no matter what kind of film it is you are making you still have to pass the believability test and this one fails at it, which is a shame, since they went through the whole routine of explaining to us in detail about John learning how to jump and run, they even come up with a device that allows him to eventually understand what Mars inhabitants are saying.There are other issues that make this one hard to enjoy. Although, she is beautiful and has a great figure, Lynn Collins, who plays our femme fatal, the Princess Dejah Thoris, gives an acting performance that was tough to handle. Maybe it was some of the dialogue that was handed to her, but I and the group I went to the movies with were making fun of her by the end of the film. ""Oh John!"" The other issue I had with this film was the fact that when dealing with this much material you need to be careful with your time. Long movies are long movies and if you handle the content well and don't give the audiences reasons to start disliking things, than even a seven hour long movie can be enjoyable. By the time we get to the 20 minute mark of the film you are already seeing indications that ""rookie-director"" isn't sure what things to cut to get this thing to a manageable length. Instead of cutting tedious, boring things out of the film, maybe some of that ""Oh John"" stuff, Stanton tried to get clever with the editing in the action scenes and there a huge amounts of jump cuts, edits that make no sense and continuity issues. When you are force fed that kind of stuff you tend to get bored or insulted.OK, enough of the bashing. Let's get into some of the good things. The story is quite good actually and I think you can credit that back to Burroughs, because I fear, if this group had tried to write something original this may have come out even worse. There are a lot of cute and humorous moments that make you smile. The film is beautiful. The CGI and all the special effects are quite good. It was nice hearing voices like Willem Dafoe and Thomas Hayden Church as the main Tharks and Mark Strong gives a good performance as the evil Matai Shang, who is the architect of all the chaos on Mars. I feel things may have worked out better if this had been broken up into two movies, thus giving Stanton more room to clean up the edits and make things flow better. You can't have a wide shot of John Carter fleeing away on horseback, away from the town, and have in the very next shot Cranston and eight or nine Union soldiers about twenty feet behind him. There has to be a device or explanation as to how that happened or it is considered a mistake. Whoops, you just lost the attention of another film-goer. I didn't hate this film. I probably will watch it again someday on DVD and I did rather enjoy some aspects if it, but in the end, the mistakes, silliness and tediousness took its toll.",John Carter
347,edwardscissorhands123,Worst Movie of 2012,1,13 July 2013,"John Carter was my #1 worst movie of 2012 for many reasons, but mostly because of the horrible production behind it. John Carter was one of Disney's most expensive film of the year and the result of it was horrible set design and the worst CGI we have ever seen in cinema history. The visual effects are worst than some of the $1 million budgeted 1970's cheap action flicks. For a movie that relied on the art production for the movie and poorly delivered on it, it automatically makes it a huge fail.A typical Sci-Fi movie consists of a poor plot sugar coated in outstanding visuals, but since John Carter lacks the visuals, the fact that its story is total garbage makes it even worse. I have never cared less about any of the characters or what happens to them in my entire life, mostly due to the weak and cheesy writing. I have forgotten what the story is even about because I do not care what so ever. All I remember is that it was a huge muddled mess that drags on and on and tests the audience patience from the very start of the movie. Throw in a ridiculous back story and a clichéd relationship and it makes it all the worse.I don't think I would have minded John Carter as much if the acting was even close to decent. Along with Battleship in the past year, Taylor Kitsch officially laid his career to rest given his over seriousness and constipated-looking expressions with horrendous line delivery, throw in some poorly choreographed action sequences and we now have ourselves a one hit ""wonder"" thanks to John Carter. The supporting cast such as Willem Dafoe and the kid from Spy Kids no one has seen in years, the cast only gets worse and worse.John Carter is the definition of a cash grab, even though it failed miserably at the box office. Thank god though that not too many people had to suffer through this horrible piece of cinematic trash.Overall Grade: F",John Carter
348,attilabarcellos,A good sci-fi movie,7,5 June 2013,"It's a considered long movie (more than two hour length), but I didn't feel that. It's has a lot of action like 99% of the nowadays sci-fi, what's not a problem for me, even though it's not a quality, too.It's starts as a story about John Carter, a former soldier in XIX century who is sick of war, lost his wife and child and starts to search for gold, when he discover and kill an alien, getting his medallion and being transported to Mars, where two races fight for the control over the planet.Besides that, we have a group of evolved aliens that watch over the progress of civilizations and manipulate things the way they want over thousands of years.And the aliens choose the ""evil"" side, and John Carter chooses the other side, which one has a beautiful princess (an obvious Hollywood fishhook that most of us love to get hooked by).The rest of the movie is the obvious, the John's heroic choice of fighting the righteous war (subliminal propaganda anywhere?) and saving Mars from the ""bad"" people.Near the end, there is a surprise that was nice; but not enough to make me forget that the most interesting thing in the movie, which is the story about the aliens and the manipulating plan behind the curtains.And because of that, and the feeling that was left on me similar to when I've watched Prometheus, of something not properly explained, that this movie deserves ""only"" a 7.And in this case is worse than on the other movie, because on this there isn't a sequence planed.But still, it's a worth seeing movie.Obs: I didn't red the book.",John Carter
349,Noah_Biondi,Should've stayed on Mars,3,21 October 2018,"John Carter is one of the biggest box office bombs of all time, and I can totally see why. Just... don't waste your time and watch a better movie. There are tons of better movies to watch than this. It's 2 hours and 12 minutes of your life you'll never get back, and it's not even an interesting 2 hours and 12 minutes. You FEEL all 132 minutes of the film. You also feel regret for watching it.What's the story? When Civil War veteran John Carter mysteriously awakes on the surface of Mars -- also called Barsoom -- he little expects the adventure that awaits him. Carter reluctantly becomes embroiled in an epic conflict among the red planet's inhabitants, including Tars Tarkas and Princess Dejah Thoris. As Barsoom is poised on the brink of collapse, war-weary Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes that everyone's fate is in his hands.Despite being the seventh most expensive film EVER made (which also kind of explains why it flopped so hard), the special effects are very poor-looking. It's like they came out of a poorly rendered PS2 game. A really bad and boring PS2 game. The textures, the locations, EVERYTHING just looks so dull and unappealing. It's not Last Airbender or Son of the Mask level terrible effects, but it's still not very pleasant to look at. At least in the film version of The Lone Ranger- another expensive flop by Disney- it at least looks nice and brings up excitement. In here, however, everything is just so bland and boring. Same can be said about the acting. It's like, nobody gives it their all. You can tell their intentions are to give out some personality, but they just act as boring as possible, and while it does fit with this film's inconsistency (because it wants to be exciting, but unfortunately results in the opposite), it's not something to be proud of. Also, the characters THEMSELVES, while some are interesting, are just not compelling AT ALL and you don't feel like rooting for anyone. They only exist because this movie's favorite food is unnecessary subplots with a side of bland production designs and acting. Can we at least get SOMETHING interesting about this movie? Well, thankfully, the story isn't too bad, even if it is kind of stupid. It's kind of like Thor where there's this guy who's always so violent and obsessed with thrashing and stuff gets sent to a new world, except the guy comes from Earth and then to Mars, unlike Thor where he was from Asgard but then got sent to Earth. So at least it has that going for it, but everything else is just bleh.In conclusion, John Carter is a giant waste of your time that should've stayed in Mars. I think this is one of the worst Mars flops created by Disney, along with My Favorite Martian and Mars Needs Moms (yeah, Disney is known for animation, Marvel, Star Wars, and now movie flops that have to do with Mars). It's best to leave this movie alone and pick another movie off of your DVD shelf, unless you REALLY wanna see it. If that's the case, I'm not stopping you. But keep in mind: just because a film is based on a beloved novel and has an interesting storyline doesn't mean it automatically equals perfection.",John Carter
350,rsmcat,Really don't get all the bad reviews. A fun good movie!,7,11 June 2012,"I was skeptical before watching this movies due to all the bad reviews i read on this title. Guess there's some true to the line: those who can DO, those who cant criticize. I really enjoyed this movie. As all movies didn't like some parts, costumes etc, but over all very well done and great entertainment. A lot of fantasy, scifi, adventure and wars going on. The cgi is simply great. Makes the new star wars look like 20 year old movies. The acting is OK too. The character could have put more dept to his past experiences, but still did a fine job. The ending is pretty clever too. Makes you want more (unlike some movies that you thank god its over). The only part I didn't like was the unexplained origin of the godlike entities that try to control destiny. Anyway, I recommend it to anyone that enjoys good cinema and a lot of Disney fantasy. People who did not like has definitely lost the fantasy we were all born with.",John Carter
351,glofau,So Bad It's Destined to Become a Cult Classic,8,26 March 2012,"I adore the cheesetastic, pulp-y goodness of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic ""A Princess of Mars."" Sexist, violent, absurd, imaginative, and oodles of stupid fun, the story is basically about a testosterone-dripping he-man who gets magically transported to Mars, where he discovers that he has super-strength and super-jumping powers which allow him to wreak havok as the ultimate killing machine while saving underdogs and damsels in distress in a world of rainbow-colored aliens with the most improbable names imaginable.At last, digital special effects have reached a point where armies of four-armed green aliens and fantastical beasts can be realized on the screen... and they are in this deliciously bad screen adaptation from one of Pixar's most acclaimed screenwriters, Andrew Stanton.Everything about this film oozes prestige and money... and the poor taste and corporate interference which exemplify the worst of contemporary Hollywood filmmaking as studios push to create the next money-making super-franchise. Think Indiana Jones mixed with Eat Drink Man Woman and Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra, with a little Disney's Beauty and the Beast and Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry thrown in for good measure, and you can appreciate the schizophrenic nature of the final product.From the opening, incomprehensible prologue, to the pointless psychological underpinnings of the characters and meaningless, poorly executed character development, the family-friendly Disney cute characters juxtaposed with homicidal maniacs and the gorgeous Frank Frazetta 70's fantasy sexploitation design work... all decorating an almost slavishly faithful realization of the original Burroughs' source material which still manages to jettison almost the entirety of the core original plot, replacing it with something even more ill-considered and absurd featuring immortal aliens and ""The Ninth Ray""... with an epic scope of pageantry and beauty and gorgeous eye-candy of pulptastic wonderfulness... I was gobsmacked.I literally started giggling uncontrollably at the start of the film, hooting with derisive laughter, gasping for breath... I laughed for the entirety of the first 45 minutes without stop, then burst into laughing fits again and again for at least 90 minutes of the film's run time. Taylor Kitsch's John Carter could hardly open his mouth without sending me into gales of laughter. This film is terribly written, formulaic, stupid, overly serious, ill-considered, embarrassing... and yet beautiful, lavish, stunningly animated, gorgeously designed, filled with authentic pulp-fiction fabulousness and excellent pacing and incredible effects and cinematography and costumes (the costume designer should win an Oscar for making those ridiculous Frazetta-inspired outfits seem so chic and elegant)... There is so much to enjoy! But be prepared for one of the lamest character stories ever written, in a film laden with bad decisions and a guiding spirit so driven to create greatness that he ends up making a film which is hopelessly ridiculous.I loved this picture... in the spirit of ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"" and the old Flash Gordon serials. It is destined to become one of the all time great cult films, because it fails on such an epic scale. It is so entertaining, so delightful, so artistic and sumptuous... and then you're rolling around on the floor, gasping for breath, because something else has happened which is completely inane, pompous, formulaic, dreadful. Almost everything on Earth at the beginning of the film is hopelessly terrible, and once you arrive on Mars... The mistake was trying to make everything seem real, authentic, truthful, with everyone so deadly serious all the time; by avoiding camp so ardently in the midst of this pulp fiction universe, they've created one of the campiest films of all time! Hilarious! Dreadful! Intoxicating! John Waters would be proud.",John Carter
352,ekenaudra,i can't believe i sat through that...,1,27 May 2012,"I just got finished reading the history behind this film. and let me just say they could have made a film about this film and it would have been more interesting!! i have never walked out of a movie before, but 15 minutes into this POS movie i really so very badly wanted to but felt i couldn't because i was with my husband and father... it wasn't until after the movie that we all agreed that the movie was crap and that ALL three of us were willing to walk out...the movie's first scene was a narrated mars ship chase and battle. with ridiculous sci-fi names. i was literally rolling my eyes!! it was like a little 13 year old boy wrote the dialogue! so i found it very hard to follow what the F was going on in the beginning because i just couldn't get over how freakin stupid it was...then there was a flash back to a drawn out chase scene of JC getting chased in a rainy 1880s era town buy a dork in a hat... (BTW they totally blew their budget on that!) OK a while later there is a dweeb looking nephew inheriting a mansion cause JC was found dead and buried in a vault only opening form the inside. OK, whatever... then said dweeb nephew is left with the personal journal of JC. and he reads it... now how many dweeb nephews who just inherited a huge estate from their ""adored"" yet estranged weird uncle would read the entire journal of their dead uncle? not me... i would be dancing around in sheer happiness that i was (rich biatch) but hey thats just me...OK so then ANOTHER flash back and its JC 15 years earlier in some new Mexico looking two horse town. there is a saloon bar fight over his unpaid tab (which he gives the bartender a piece of gold that pays his debt off, WHY he couldn't settle the debt first (BEFORE the fighting) is beyond me...army men come and the next 15-20 minutes is him escaping, getting caught, fighting back, getting beaten down. (they were trying to show that the character was resilient) come to find out he is NOT a fugitive just a draft dodger because he ""won't fight for anyone's side"" a theme that he boasts on throughout the entire freaking movie! he escapes and then there is a fight scene with some Apache Indians, another chase scene he is cornered in a cave where the Indians fear to go (cliché) so then thats where he is attacked by a person from mars. a glowing key looking thing is struggled over and JC repeats some stupid words and then he is flat on his back in the middle of a desert on Mars.there is a 15 minute scene of him trying to walk but instead keeps falling until he realizes that he can just jump really high and far. green ""indian"" Martians capture him and take him to their village where he is given a special drink that allows him to understand their language... apparently this is something frowned upon because the female that gave him the enlightening drink gets punished.there is a dog looking thing that runs fast. a smart, scantily clad, and conflicted Martian princess (who is being forced to marry the enemy Another cliché!) from a city named... ""helium"" (yeah, i chuckled really hard at that stupid name) there are more green guys, a whole new set of ""immortal"" bald headed bad guys that apparently like to control the outcome of worlds...and 2 hours later i was yawning and becoming cranky that my seat was uncomfortable and i couldn't just fall asleep...their were 2 things about that movie that impressed me. 1. when JC was captured a sort of reddish tattoo line was embedded into his skin this held him captive and also forced him to walk, move, and even silenced him... i guess i just kinda thought that that was cool 2. at the end of the movie when JC explains to his dweeb nephew that he needed to use him as bait to lure a thern, so that he could get a key and go back to mars... i thought that was clever, and amusing... oh and 1 more thing that i really liked a lot was right when the movie ended and the first part of the credits rolled, yeah that part was freaking awesome!",John Carter
353,paytonprovo,Not that bad,8,23 April 2012,"I don't know why there are some bad reviews on this movie. There was good special effects and okay acting. There was also good action and okay story telling. Yes there are some cheesy parts and some funny parts. The story gets confusing at points but I could get through it. The plot is John Carter getting to mars mistakenly and on mars there is a big civil war. With John being human he has super strength, the good side of Mars has him on their side. This is an okay movie and every action fan should watch it. I think Taylor Kischk is an okay actor with a good performance and Mark Strong is the same with his typical side roles. I loved the effects, I loved the green people. I can't remember what they were called but they looked good. I thought they were funny too.

354,nunonegro,A well-constructed movie,8,23 December 2015,"I recently watched ""john Carter"" which has passed on television.I think this movie is a well constructed one: has a simple yet captivating story; from the beginning, you clearly understand what's happening in Barsoom, what is the goal of John Carter (return to Virginia), and you understand what needs to happen in order to Carter to return. In this sense, it's not an original movie: what makes it special is the special effects, which are very good (what you should expect from Disney)I like the fact the movie has several twists in the end: first you think he will not return to earth, then it takes another twist and he is able to return to Barsoom, with several twists to recover the required device. I think this movie should have a better rating, however I understand some point of view, because there are several characters that deserved to be better developed, and the ""beginning of the end"", which is one of the most interesting parts, it's very summarized (it should have been expanded).",John Carter
355,dan-1315,Decide for Yourself,7,3 June 2012,"With the DVD/BluRay release of ""John Carter,"" the home video audience will be able to decide for itself whether this movie deserved the terrible treatment that Disney gave it. For me, the film is visually stunning and gets better as it goes on, racing to a slam-bang finish. It's easily better than ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"" and the three Transformer movies, all of which are in the $300 million+ domestic earnings club. With a little help from Disney, John Carter should have easily grossed about double its $75 million domestic take on top of the $210 million it took in internationally. The question of why it didn't will be a topic of discussion for some time. There might even be books written about it, especially since Rich Ross, chairman of Walt Disney Co.'s film unit, and a few others resigned because of the film's failure.The simplest explanation is it was orphaned by current Disney chiefs who don't like science fiction movies and don't understand them. Other than ""Tron"" and the Witch Mountain movies, Disney has rarely done sci-fi, usually with dismal results. But some have suggested that Disney deliberately sabotaged it, needing a write-off to compensate for the huge profits The Avengers movie was going to bring in. After all, where is the famous Disney merchandise? The only thing Disney is selling is a T-shirt with the JCM symbol on it. Disney made $2 billion from ""Cars 2"" merchandise but it didn't even try to put out any ""John Carter"" merchandise. Strange.Also Disney seems to have set up director Andrew Stanton for failure. It doesn't seem like the studio gave him any positive help or guidance other than apparently wanting him to throw out the novels and go in a different direction. In the end, it gave him tons of money to buy plenty of rope to hang himself with. If the film was a success, everyone would take credit. And if it was a failure, then it would be Stanton's fault.Disney's highly vaunted marketing department also failed to give the film any help at all, perhaps even scaring away audiences and millions of dollars of earnings. It changed the title from a fantastically romantic one, ""A Princess of Mars,"" to the more anonymous ""John Carter of Mars,"" to removing the ""of Mars"" so audiences may not have even known it was sci-fi. The movie poster shows nothing of what is in the movie and is probably the worst seen in decades. The DVD/BluRay cover is even worse. making it look like a Conan the Barbarian movie rather than a sci-fi epic. The ineptitude shown here could not have been an accident.As for the movie itself, it's slow going for most of the first half. Stanton is trying to juggle three prologues and material from the first three Edgar Rice Burroughs novels. Someone at Disney should have advised him to simplify the plot and stay within the confines of the first book but the script instead bears of the scars of too many ideas introduced by too many rewrites. By the second half it buckles down to the kind of swift action climax that Pixar, and Stanton's contributions to Pixar films, is known for.Technically the movie is top-notch. The photography is beautiful. The CGI is really great. Costumes, production design, et al. are excellently executed. There's a gem of a movie hidden here. If Disney hadn't been so eager to take a big loss on the film, the studio might have had another film franchise. Even so, the film is not as bad as it's been treated. Hopefully, home video audiences will see it for what it's worth.",John Carter

I feel this could have been a major blockbuster had Disney Marketing group done it's job properly. After so many years, it is showing a profit from people redescovering it. Too bad ""executives"" at Disney didn't believe in the storyline and continue with the series. Remember Star Wars got raked over the coals when it first came out in 1977, but went on to become a Major Franchise.

358,orme,"Read It, Then See It, Then Bash It (If You Must)",5,5 April 2012,"I was really really really looking forward to this movie. I read all of the Barsoomian series when I was about 14 and loved them.It's too bad that many of the 'bashers' on this site haven't read the books. John Carter didn't rip off Star Wars, Star Wars borrowed from Burroughs's books. As did Siegel and Schuster when they wrote ""Superman"" ('leaps tall buildings in a single bound' ring a bell, anyone?); a fact they freely admit.It's also too bad the folks associated with this movie didn't trust their material. Bad sign when ""John Carter of Mars"" becomes ""John Carter"". Worse sign when the story is manipulated to provide an 'explanation' for planetary travel; there was no explanation in Burrough's book, simply a 'leap' of faith from the reader.I didn't like the actor who was chosen to play John Carter. Too much 'pretty boy' and not enough 'grizzled veteran' for me. The Dejah Thoris actress did a fine job, but who insisted on the phony English accents? Come on, people! Maybe someday before I die someone with integrity and faith will take this project up again. Who knows? In the 1970s ""The Hobbit"" was nothing more than a cartoon character and then 25 years later Peter Jackson took on the material. Miracles can happen.Read the books and remember what it's like to be 14 and thrilled. Then see the movie. Then complain.",John Carter
359,symmachos,Beautiful But Flawed,6,10 March 2012,"I first encountered Edgar Rice Burroughs and his Martian tales exactly 50 years ago, as a collection of beautifully illustrated books stowed in the back of my small-town public library. That library has since burned down, and the books went with it, but my love for Barsoom never abated. So last night, when Disney's adaptation of A Princess of Mars premiered under its focus-group-approved title of John Carter, I was there.Overall I enjoyed the movie. Disney wisely decided against updating the source material and kept the action embedded in its 19th century context. They did an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere of the old illustrations, so the visual impact of the film is strong. Those six-limbed green Martians have been brought to life as only CGI can do it, and the vast, swirling battle scenes look like they leaped from the pages of the book, with John Carter hurtling over his enemies like Douglas Fairbanks. I especially liked the glimpses of Helium and Zodanga, the battling Martian cities; these are thoroughly otherworldly places, with an ancient/future look that is central to Burroughs' vision. At times it even seemed that director Andrew Stanton took some Futurist cues from Aelita, Queen of Mars (1924).I also liked Taylor Kitsch in the title role. I might have picked somebody more convincingly Southern and military (Josh Holloway springs to mind), instead of an ex-model for Abercrombie & Fitch. But Kitsch brings a wry sense of humor to Captain Carter, and I liked his chemistry with Lynn Collins, the actual Princess of Mars. Physically Kitsch is ideal, with a lithe body like you see in illustrations from the 1920s, rather than a steroid overdose.Lynn Collins faces more barriers as Dejah Thoris, the perennial damsel in distress, but at least she wields a sword with the best of them, and we are constantly reminded that this princess is a scientist. Disney's Dejah departs from the original in one key area: she's the one who first puts the moves on Carter. I thoroughly approve.A FEW SPOILERS AHEADNow for what I didn't like. One strength of A Princess of Mars is the way it takes you step-by-step from Earth to Mars, providing a detailed narrative of Carter's early days among the green men of Thark and letting us watch the strange world of Barsoom unfold through his eyes. Stanton chose the opposite approach. He begins the movie in the midst of wild Barsoomian action involving the men of Zodanga, and only later introduces John Carter. He also adds an absurdly complex back story to explain how Carter traveled to Mars, where Burroughs was content with Apache magic. To do so Stanton took two minor characters from the original series – Sab Than, Prince of Zodanga, and Matai Shang, Holy Hekkador of the Holy Therns – and goosed them into major villains. I would have been far happier if Matai Shang did not appear at all, and certainly not in this bald, shape-shifting, and thoroughly anti-Burroughs incarnation.Just as unfortunate is the choppy way in which John Carter's early days among the Tharks are handled. Burroughs built a careful narrative of Carter's rise through the ranks, paralleled by the rise of his Martian friend, Tars Tarkas. Every time Carter killed a Thark, he took the dead warrior's name and possessions, winning the right to live among his captors as ""a prisoner with power."" Similarly, Tars Tarkas begins simply as a chieftain, and only slowly rises to Jed (big chief) and finally Jeddak (emperor).But in the film, Tarkas is already Jeddak at the outset, and we never learn why the green Martians call our hero Dotar Sojat (it's because he killed two guys named Dotar and Sojat). Still worse, we get only a garbled version of my favorite part of the Tharkian chapters: the strange history of Sola, the only green Martian capable of love and compassion. Although Sola appears in the movie, and we do learn that she is Tarkas' daughter, her story unfolds in a puzzling, disjointed way that is bound to confuse anybody who doesn't know the book. Thus Stanton squandered an opportunity to tell an alien but moving story, and failed to flesh out two characters who are central to his plot.I could continue listing all the departures from Burroughs, but I'd sound even more like a geeky old curmudgeon. I'll make just two last complaints. First, Disney was stupid to introduce Dejah Thoris on screen before John Carter meets her, so we lose the opportunity to see her from his perspective. Second, one key scene violates everything Burroughs tells us about Martian mores. Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, tells Dejah that she must marry a villain she hates in order to bring peace and save her city. I had to stifle a groan.To quote from the novel: ""Tardos Mors . . . has sent word that he and his people would rather look upon the dead face of their princess than see her wed to any than her own choice, and that personally he would prefer being engulfed in the ashes of a lost and burning Helium.""Bottom line: I enjoyed the movie, but with mixed feelings. It's gratifying to see these old Martian visions brought to life, but Disney and Stanton undercut their success by treating the source material in such a cavalier manner. This retelling of A Princess of Mars could have had an impact similar to Avatar or Lord of the Rings, but the creative team decided instead to concoct an unnecessarily contrived and chaotic story that is unlikely to translate into market share.Peter Jackson understood that you need to follow the book and pay attention to hardcore fans. Andrew Stanton did not. I'm grateful that he brought us this gorgeous piece of cinema, but I doubt we'll be seeing a sequel in my lifetime.Still, I'd love to be wrong.",John Carter
360,boltar469,"More ""inspired by"" than adaptation - but good entertainment",7,14 June 2014,"I've tried to avoid speaking directly about anything that happens in the plot.My wife, who isn't generally a sword, sandals and magic fan, found a few minutes of this entertaining enough that she actually agitated for us to watch the whole thing. I'm a rabid F&SF nerd myself, so I can sit through fairly crappy stuff - which this emphatically is NOT. I agree with some reviewers that it could have been way better - but to compare it with the massive project that was Lord of the Rings is unfair. I think it earned the 6.6 it currently has or maybe even a 7.something. The casting and effects were pretty decent - there was a fair bit of scenery chewing all around but fer gosh sakes, this is of necessity an action flick! There were was about the right sprinkling of funny moments.A few years back I forced myself to sit through ""A Princess of Mars"" - a direct to video abomination based on the same original material. That well deserves its current 3.3. Traci Lords, who played Dejah Thoris, claims to have actually run from the room crying after watching a couple of minutes of it, having made the ghastly error of allowing herself to be cast. Antonio Sabato Jr.'s work reminds me a lot of Harry Hamlin's in the original Clash of the Titans - a complete waste of air.This version is at least a couple of orders of magnitude better than that bowser and I'm can't quite account for its failure to pull any significant theater audience in the US. I found it well worth the $3 it took to rent it from Amazon for a few days.If you're an absolute stickler for complete faithfulness to the original, you won't be happy with this. But it had pretty much the right look and feel, except for John Carter having been transformed into yer basic current anti-hero (Wolverine as currently portrayed by Hugh Jackman is sort of the idea, though Jackman does it much better) and we were well entertained.",John Carter
361,orion_ss1,a GREAT movie for what it was meant to be,8,14 March 2012,"The ""critics"" and I rarely agree on what is and is not a good film; this was another excellent example of that pattern.I went expecting to see a fantasy adventure flick; no complicated plot, lots of action, and some neat special effects ( part of my PI day celebration, what you'd expect of an engineer ). And that is what I got. A few twists I didn't see to offset the one's I did.I opted for the 3D version ( which my girlfriend enjoyed more than me ) and that might have been a mistake for me. The set up to get a Civil War cavalryman to Mars was, by Science Fiction standards, believable. The set up for John Carter's characteristics ( skills as a warrior and tenacity ) was well done; his haunted past was brought to light a little more haphazardly and, for my taste, a little confusing, done in quick flashbacks. The set up for the conflict between the tall ( no where near 12 foot tall unless John Carter was 8 to 9 foot tall himself ) green folk and the more human red men ( and women, basically Caucasians with red tattoos ) was also well done, if somewhat predictable. And ( not a spoiler since it was discussed in the IMDb quotes ) why the green folk called him ""Virginia"" was a hoot.There seemed to be as many female warriors ( red people ) as male, with interesting armor differences.If you go to a flick to catch errors, this one has them, so you won't be disappointed. But if you just want to escape for a couple of hours, this is still the one to watch. I'm hoping the DVD will be available without the 3D, but I do look forward to watching it again.",John Carter

All the action sequences feel composed like trailers for the movie instead of the actual movie, with incohesive spasms of diverse color schemes, and the sequencing's mash up editing. Like a trailer, it doesn't slow down to explain what's unfolding before you, but a trailer is meant to excite you for the movie so you can go and see a more fleshed out and explained version of what you previewed.Though when the movie does slow down to reflect on what's going on, it becomes deflated by the rehashed stock personality's of barbarians, aliens, and any other character. No emotion is even attempted in the mistake of taking itself too seriously, and ending up coming across as dry and recycled in performance and character design, for these actors thinking that monotone intimidation is the way to seem badass. This film is okay if your intention of watching is just for turning your brain off and desiring nothing more than the relentless blur of action like that of a Transformer installment in return, but be prepared instead for action scenes cluttered to the brim in a misguided attempt at overcrowding itself to be epic.",John Carter

I experienced it as a partly breathtaking parade of impressive landscapes, panorama shots, aliens, costumes and sets connected by a complex story about power, resistance and of course love that culminates in a clever ending.The only reason I give not all 10 stars is because I have to confess that I found the story sometimes a little too complex and therefore hard to follow.But this feast for the eye is by any means the money for the ticket worth. I've never seen such a spectacular movie. My dream fulfilled: A new overwhelming sf- spectacular which isn't part of the Star Wars or Star Trek franchise but opens a new rich and fantastic world and which has- in opposite to the SW prequels- a logical and intricate story.All my hopes that it won't bomb but allow new adventures with John Carter on the Mars to be filmed.",John Carter

It is indeed an attempt at spectacle and creating something epic but that's all it ends up being... an admirable effort. There's nothing extraordinary about any of it. The story, special effects and the action sequences struck me as being very ordinary. There's very little depth to any of it and yet many scenes felt bloated and overlong. There's also the aspect that plot points and character motivation were explained and justified quite poorly. Still, I was interested in this sci-fi ride and was enchanted by the lovely Lynn Collins.

368,MidnightMax,"""John Carter"" is a pleasant surprise.",8,13 March 2012,"At the Theater- John Carter - I loved it. It's a bit corny here and there but has enough soaring action, crystal clear spectacle and subtle, ""little"" touches to firmly separate it from the cold, emotionless Star Wars prequels. The movie rarely feels bloated- It's one of the best constructed and filmed, massive-budgeted, SFX-heavy releases I've seen in quite some time. Hell, I enjoyed it much more than Avatar. Needless to say, I was immensely entertained.Writer/Director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, Wall-E, A Bug's Life, Monster's Inc.) makes his live-action debut a memorable one, visually speaking- location footage in New Mexico and Utah (often subbing for the surfaces of Mars) is absolutely beautiful. It was thrilling to see such a CGI-heavy film mixing natural scenery in with the manufactured shots- much like the excellent New Zealand location footage used in the Lord Of The Rings films established a spacious, tangible setting, it gives the proceedings a solid, authentic foundation.Based upon Edgar Rice Burrough's ""Princess Of Mars"", the film feels like a nostalgic throwback to yesteryear in it's tone- expect an adventurous, stranger-in-a-strange-land story along the lines of Stargate or, oddly enough, Hidalgo. For a moment or two, I felt like a younger person...Taylor Kitsch surprised me as the titular character- he's often likable and has presence to spare. This seems to be his year as he's the lead of the upcoming Battleship. That said, the standout of this film is the beauty of Texas-born Lynn Collins- I couldn't take my eyes off of her... the film should have stuck with the Burrough's-given story title of ""Princess Of Mars"". Perhaps that would have helped with the film's marketing, which was abysmal. Actors portraying humanoid characters that you may notice: Ciaran Hinds, Dominic West, Mark Strong, Bryan Cranston and James Purefoy. Featuring the voices of Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church, Samantha Morton and Polly Walker as non-humanoid characters. Oh yeah, and there's a damned-cool dog-thing that really grows on you.Complaints: the film opens a bit clunky, the dialogue could have used a few tweaks and the film needed a stronger central villain.If you have even the least bit of interest, by all means see it in a quality theater- I highly recommend it. Cynics need not apply.8.5 out of 10",John Carter
369,dreamer2point2,Okay but..,7,8 June 2013,"I tried to approach John Carter as someone who had not read the books. But I HAD read the books so it was somewhat disorienting to see all the familiar characters and settings but an almost entirely different story. Unlike some, I didn't have a problem with this John Carter's attitude problems, but Dejah Thoris failed to charm me. Of course the ""Incomparable"" princess was never more than a raison d'etre in the books anyway so I didn't expect much. I have to say, the VFX were stunning and very true to the books (except Woola was too cute) I just didn't get some aspects of the story and few explanations were given. For instance, why was the city of Zodanga a big moving pile of metal? And, why bring Therns into the plot when they clearly weren't necessary? I have other questions that will never be answered but those are important, sort of. As an action/adventure film it was compelling if a little disjoint and It's too bad there won't be a sequel. I'd like to see more character development and perhaps the other two Barsoomian races (Yellow & Black) but I'll manage. I really think it's a film worth watching. Mostly because it's visually stunning.",John Carter
370,rscott25,"Sometimes, you have to watch a movie a second time to enjoy it.",10,13 August 2020,"I grew up reading Conan the Barbarian original series, and the whole John Carter series. I had certain expectations the first go round. The suspension of belief was not one (you need to have it for this movie), but more of the story line as I remembered it. But the second go round, while story not exact, it truly does follow the whole spirit of the books, and is a lot closer than as I originally remembered. Deja Thoris, a Princess of Mars. Thought the title characters were excellently cast, and acting, directing very well done. Was truly a great effort, and underrated movie. If a fan of the books, I think yo do need to watch it twice to accept the few, very few, departures of the books to enjoy the spirit of the movie. If you got into these books,and the sense of when you were a kid reading them, you'll enjoy the sci-fi of this movie of that period of your life with it.To those questioning to logic of it all, remember, this was all written, in 1912, 100 yrs before it came to screen. At the time, we barely knew how to fly. A good suggestion for nostalgia Sci-fi is, the First Men IN the Moon. Far crazier than this. But it is fun sci-fi fantasy.The get the emotion of it was, at the end, he had fallen in love with his Princess of Mars, and then separated suddenly, and was obsessed, to get back to the woman he loved, over millions of miles, and he was quite sure how..I actually teared up.",John Carter

John Carter is a great movie and instant classic. I loved it.It is done in the vein of star wars and lord of the rings - complete with a detailed new world stocked with a variety of warring races, exotic (highly detailed) animals, and a manipulative godlike race working to control all that happens.

374,Thatguywiththeface,"John Carter. Obviously, the writers felt it unnecessary to read even the first chapter of the book.",1,5 September 2012,"So, I can't even make fun of this movie, it basically makes fun of itself. I'll just name some of the major stuff that peeved me about this movie.First major peeve was, the lack of originality. This movie probably literally ripped off every sci-fi movie known to man. Just of the top of my head, I saw creatures AND entire scenes ripped off of Star Wars, Star Trek (2009), Men In Black, Avatar, AND Avatar:The Last Airbender. So, THAT alone would be enough to make me hate this steaming pile, but, then on top of that, they threw in some of the WORST dialog I've EVER heard. I mean, these crap lines RIVALED Mega Piranha in how bad they were. Throw on top of that, a story that you could probably not follow unless you read the book because it was just a jumbled mess of bad dialog and stolen scenes most of the time. Also, this movie had a HUGE budget, but some of the special effects are REALLY bad. I'm talking flying scenes where you can see the outlines around the physical objects and fight scenes where Carter's hair turns green because they didn't take the time to take out enough the background on their effects shots. So I'm talking VERY blatant, bad effects.And then, my final point... PLOT HOLES. (OK, SLIGHT spoilers here) They have god like creatures who can shape shift into other characters, but these godlike characters rely on the Mars people to make sure their ultimate plan is achieved which... *gasp*, shocker, turns out to be their downfall. An Entire army (dressed in bright red no less) hides outside a city to attack it and NOBODY notices them... yeeeeah. Apparently also, the ONLY thing stopping the primitive race from dominating the planet was their refusal to fly. And lastly, the thing that actually started off cool, the gravity is not as strong on Mars, and John Carter, being from Earth, is not used to the lower level of gravity, which allows him to super jump and be strong. Again, that IS cool, but we learn later that it's not ACTUALLY John Carter, it's a clone of him. So, that being the case, the clone would not have known the earth's gravity, therefore, negating his super powers.Oh, now here's a whole bunch I forgot about. John Carter himself is a shallow character, (who for some reason talks like Batman) and we NEVER learn ANYTHING about him except that he doesn't want to join a ""side"" for some reason that's NEVER explained. The Princess is a shallow, pointless character who didn't even NEED to be a main character. The story would've gone the EXACT same way had she not been there. The bad guys were forgettable at best. They contradict their own universe. (A character says he will crush John Carter like an un-hatched egg, yet in the beginning of the film they SHOT the un-hatched eggs) John Carter SINGLE HANDEDLY takes out an entire army of aliens with two swords, 1, with no real hand to hand training so to speak of, (I know he was a cavalry man but, come on, horse soldiers DID NOT fight like that) and 2, this is something he should've done in the FIRST PLACE TO ESCAPE HIS ORIGINAL CAPTORS. In the arena fight scene (scene ripped right off the Geonosis Arena in Star Wars Episode 2, creature designs ripped right off Star Trek-2009) he uses his chain to fling a huge rock. I'd be OK with that, except that in the scene RIGHT BEFORE THAT a rock that was the EXACT SAME SIZE was the only thing keeping him from jumping out of his cell!!!!!! Add to all that that they don't explain ANYTHING in the beginning, they do that WAY later when you're thoroughly confused, even though there was ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to keep this information from you EXCEPT to confuse you. Then add to that, every time they thought they were losing the audience they'd throw in the ""spider web"" symbol that kept coming up yet, had no actual meaning or purpose to anything in the end. So, as you can tell, this movie was MORE than frustrating to me. But it was great fun to laugh at and make fun of somehow I don't think that's what the makers were going for though.",John Carter

Were we too polite to the director, producer and Disney? After all, we have been taught to kiss-ass rather than to lose our place in society or to lose our jobs? Just think about it.

I had my doubts about this for the longest time, and I am so glad I finally watched John Carter.The film is more humorous than I had expected and had me chuckling more than once. The Martian DOG had me rolling!The story was interesting, but I really liked the characters and the acting. The special effects were top notch as well, but I expected that with a big Disney budget.I especially like how E. R. Burrows was drawn into the story, and the end seriously brought a tear to my eye.I had only seen Kitsch in Wolverine, but I liked his character acting then, and thought he did a fine job as JC. Collins (also in Wolverine), was stunning as usual. The rest of the cast was equally good, I thought.There are a lot of movies that have come out lately that I had to force myself to watch all the way though (Cowboys and Aliens comes to mind...), but I wish JC had been longer!If only Disney had done a better job deciding who this film was marketed to, I think it would have blown away the box office.As it stands, the movie did turn a modest profit, so here's one person who is hoping to see more of JC on the big screen.I am so looking forward to seeing...John Carter...of MARS!",John Carter

Not a campy adventure like Flash Gordon (which was fun) but a serious science fiction/fantasy film literally from another age. Makes Star Wars seem childish and is a significantly better story than Avatar and certainly does not have the environmental sop you see in so many films. Serious actors, serious script, and serious direction. No attempts at cheap humor (although there are bits of humor here and there and there is one character you HAVE to like)nor juvenile distractions and none of the self flagellation you see in so many sci-fi and fantasy films where the characters wallow in dark misery and keep a stone faced grimace all through the film. I really can't compare it to another film, it stands alone and you come out of the theater with a spring in your step. I think this film will gain increasing acceptance...and it is a great stand alone film. Will it get an Oscar, no, but it is a film that hits on all eight cylinders which is a quite rare event so I give it a ten for that. Disney spent 250 million on it to get it right.

384,Geschichtenerzaehler,Two dimensional characters taking themselves too seriously. Nice effects.,6,15 December 2012,"John Carter is based on pulp stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Knowing this, I was kind of prepared for a campy story instead of a deep, rich plot. I was still somewhat disappointed.The story can be summed up as a mix of Dances with Wolves (same plot as Avatar or Pocahuntas) on Mars and an old Sindbad movie: Former Soldier ends up in a strange world, meets its princess and must become the worlds savior. There's also an ecological message hidden somewhere in it (a part of the movie terribly uncared for). Throw in some strange creatures and some swashbuckling and you got ""John Carter on Mars"".Pulp can be adapted into something pretty great, if the result doesn't take itself too seriously and gives us interesting, lovable characters. Unfortunately the lead actor has less charisma than a dry slice of bread. The dialogs are so cheesy at times, they rival some of George Lucas worst writings. The characters are nothing but cardboard cutouts... ""noble, rebellious hero"", ""emancipated damsel in distress"", ""noble indigenous warrior"", ""evil indigenous warrior"", ... it rarely gets any deeper than these descriptions. Even worse, there's little to no self-irony to counter any of that.

385,orthoclin,Science Fiction adaptation,8,29 March 2012,"John Carter is probably the best movie of the year that hardly anyone will see.The victim of poor timing and poor marketing, it is engaging and spectacular and its director has put enough Pixar-Disney into it that it is really well worth seeing.While not The Incredibles it is no ""Waterworld"" either and does not deserve its negative reviews.It is a classic Sci-fi popcorn movie that relies heavily on CG green screen and effects and could never have been made before the last decade. My main criticism of this film and of all new 3D films such as this is that they must not be shot in 2D and converted. The 3D allows the audience to be immersed in the scene or feel they are looking through a massive window and requires longer clips and some first person shots and should avoid any shots with a short focal length .Avatar is exceptional because of its ability to do all that and I don't believe this film benefits from it but could have.Hopefully a sequel will follow as Burroughs did write several novels set on Mars. .Better title would have been Barsoom-Mars",John Carter

In a time when the global audience has grown into the sophistication of CGI technology in movies, ""John Carter"" achieves a unique status in my mind: the special effects do not overpower the story, they enhance it in delightfully skillful way.I read all of the ""John Carter"" books before I was 12 years old. But, honestly, I don't remember much about them. I remember bits and pieces, but I was much more a fan of E.R. Burroughs ""Tarzan"" books.

390,Bosch,JOHN CARTER is both bloated and incomplete,5,11 March 2012,"I came to this movie without having read the John Carter novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but I am familiar with later writers of the weird tale period, namely Robert E. Howard, H.P. Lovecraft, and Clark Ashton Smith to name three. So I knew what to expect in terms of SF fantasy.Essentially, JOHN CARTER the film is a missed opportunity, given that it cost over $200 million US to make and had the likes of Andrew Stanton hired to adapt an icon of American fantasy fiction.The main problem is the story. It fails to introduce the audience to the world and cultures of Barsoom properly. THE LORD OF THE RINGS accomplished this feat perfectly. Instead, here we are left with a whole bunch questions about who, why, what, and how, in relation to factions, cultures, technology, character motivations, physics, etc. Also, the Martian landscapes should have looked redder and more alien than they did.With considerable effort, I just took for granted the unfolding narrative, and ignored all of the confusing events, missing plot points, slim characterisation, and that ridiculous jumping nonsense. But JOHN CARTER proves that George Lucas' massive blunder with the STAR WARS prequels can happen to anyone, even to someone with a resume as impressive as Andrew Stanton's and much lower expectations to fulfill.JOHN CARTER could have been a triumph if it had preserved more of the source material's literary sensibilities. As it stands, the movie feels both bloated and incomplete. Prime example? The title card at the end even says JOHN CARTER ***OF MARS***. In the rush to cram as much action, conflict and set pieces into the movie, the filmmakers forgot how to tell an engaging story. As others have mentioned, the pacing is all over the place, as is the tone, which switched from political subterfuge to slapstick comedy to romance to battle scenes. Speaking of which, I can't be the only punter who is getting bloody sick of huge CGI armies doing battle in a movie. Memo to filmmakers: CG war scenes have become tedious to watch. Nobody can even follow what happens in these virtual mêlées, let alone care about the outcome. Ditto the now obligatory arena sequence.I saw JOHN CARTER in 3D, and it looked horrible in places. Every time I saw 2D vegetation in the middle distance, I cringed. Try this experiment, kids: during the film, close one eye. If the face or whatever you're looking at doesn't change, that means the filmmakers didn't bother mapping that element into 3D. For a $200 million plus film, that seems to be inexcusable. Why not just release it in 2D, instead of insulting audiences this way?There's more to say, but other reviewers have already covered it. The bottom line is...the bottom line. If JOHN CARTER flops, the studio and filmmakers only have themselves to blame. Peter Jackson showed that it is possible to adapt a complex fantasy novel, and turn it into a financial and critical success. Let's hope that his example does not end up being the only one.",John Carter

But having seen John Carter, I'm impressed at how Jim Cameron, despite a simple story, engaged the viewer and had them connect to, even emotionally invested in, the characters and their journey, especially the lead protagonist.John Carter's Mars is as rich and diverse a place as Pandora. But I felt that they tried to pack too much in it and layered with so much exposition that there was no time to actually absorb anything. And yet every time the story did slow down I always found myself yawing and frankly quite bored. The biggest problem, I think, is that there was no character I cared about, even despite John Carter's past.By the time the things settled in Avatar, everything, including the leads was CGI. John Carter had the advantage to still having the leads as humans but they completely missed the bus. The movie turned out to be exactly what I expected judging from the trailers, all spectacle, no substance. I got swayed into watching this on the opening weekend having read the positive and raving reviews online. Extremely disappointing and a huge step back from Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean.",John Carter

This movie kept me glued to my seat, and I have actually thought about the movie many times after I have seen it. Anyone who does not fall in love with this movie needs to have his head examined. The actors and actresses, especially the leads, are as good if not better than any I have ever seen.Did I say that this is a great movie??

Specifically, what was wrong? Pacing? It was intense!!! Coming from someone who uses this word sparingly, this movie was ""EPIC"". I am almost certain that time will enable objectivity, and objectivity will redeem it from the stinging taint slapped on it due to a predictably simplistic aversion to what is ""mainstream"" by film critics. If a studio other than Disney could have created the same film with half the budget it would have been heralded as a cinematic achievement within the sci-fi genre, but its budget was viewed as ostentatious and its production studio as childish, so it became ""cool"" to hate on it before anyone had even seen it.Who makes something and how much they pay to have it made has nothing to due with the quality of what is actually produced, it may be indicative of quality or lack thereof, but the final product speaks for itself. Reviews of John Carter tell us more about film critics than the critics told us about the film. It was practically perfect. ""Incomprehensible plotting""??? They laid the groundwork for the presumed sequels by deliberately leaving a few questions unanswered, which I hope they still make and answer because I loved this first one! Mars was epic, and then in the end we are reminded that the story began on Earth and the film ends stronger than I could have hoped for! An excellent story masterfully told on screen.",John Carter

Not only is this true to the novels, those who like me were raised on Marvel's Warlord of Mars series, will find many things recognizable too. Amazingly well cast, fantastic visuals and a rich narrative - its one flaw might be, that it is not as fast paced as an attention deficient audience is used to, this hails from a time where you build up your story.
This is not only an excellent sci-fi movie but also a love letter to the pulp era.",John Carter
402,rowlandy,Flash Gordon meets Avatar through a Stargate.,6,2 March 2012,"That's not to say this movie used ideas from all these films, but the reverse. The movie is based on the book, 'A Princess of Mars', by Edgar Rice Burroughs which is 100 years old this year.I was lucky to get tickets to the premier in London at the BFI. The cast was there and after the movie the director came on stage for a Q&A.While I enjoyed the movie as a piece of escapism, I just found that I couldn't fully engage with the characters. The storyline was difficult to follow: Who were the Martians and why did they look exactly like humans? Why did the the other species (the Tharks) look so alien? What was the war about and how did the shape shifting astral travellers fit into the story? There were some brief explanations but nothing convincing. The world created wasn't fully complete: What food is eaten, where is it grown, where do they get water, how do they make their flying machines, houses, clothes, etc. etc . . . This civilisation didn't look like it could exist in this barren landscape. There was nothing anything could be made from. I may have to read the book to get an understanding of the film plot.Having said that, it was very nicely shot, the CGI was convincing and it was fun.The 3D didn't really add to the experience. Halfway through the film, I no longer noticed it was in 3D (but I was sitting at the far left edge of the cinema, might have been better if I was in the centre).",John Carter
403,Malgus,Padawan John Carter of Geonosis,3,16 March 2015,"John Carter (the movie) is based on Edgar Burroughs Barsoom series which has been quite thoroughly cannibalized in the last 100 years by numerous films, series, and other books. Virtually everything you see in this movie will feel like it's been ripped off from something else. And I'm not just talking about themes, but there are actual shots and scenes that look copy-pasted.Andrew Stanton, who's made a name directing CGI cartoons like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, etc. seems to have read George Lucas' movie making manual and does the same thing which is throwing as much CGI garbage on the screen in hope that it will be exciting. No, I'm sorry but it isn't. Not when you have ridiculous characters and messy plot that needs to be explained through exposition every 15 minutes. I'm unsure why they even bothered with live action, because slightly tweaked and PG rated, this could've been a decent children's cartoon.In its core JC is a love story wrapped in fantasy action-adventure jacket. Unfortunately, because everything is so shallow, humorless and artificial, it lacks any emotional gravity and becomes borderline boring. The lead actor is terribly miscast, in my opinion, and is completely devoid of any charisma. Llyn Collins who plays princess Leia..I mean Dejah is arguably the only interesting element in this entire film.John Carter is a movie that drowns in its own ambition and ultimately fails due to its own incompetence. Is it total garbage? Heck no. It could've been worse if they had hired a little kid to play John Carter, and Adam Sandler to play the villain. If you think that Attack of the Clones was the bestest Star wars movie ever, then you'll probably like John Carter too. Otherwise, it's a just mediocre two hour time-waster... for 5 year olds.",John Carter
404,Lyra-gp,"How can I help you? A ticket to Mars, please...",9,9 March 2012,"I've just come back from tonight's screening, but I already feel the need to turn my excitement into words. Here is a list of the most important points concerning the movie.I- Book VS Movie First of all, I'm quite sure you all know that the story behind John Carter is from an Edgar Rice Burrough's novel called 'A Princess of Mars'. Let's be frank, this is one of the best novels ever written in American literature: The precursor of the sci-fi genre, it is remarkably well- written and ingeniously structured. Disney and Pixar had to face, then, an hard task: turning one of the most beloved American classics into a movie it's not what we would define 'easy', for sure. Especially if there are lots and lots of fans striving for a good installment that does not spoil the general atmosphere of Burrough's masterpiece. In my opinion, Disney and Pixar successfully managed to provide us with a modern adaptation of the book: funny, moving and thrilling, perfectly reflects the spirit of 'The Princess of Mars'.II- Creating a planet One of the best features of the movie is undoubtedly its setting. The hard work that Pixar put in the creation of the land where the story takes place is highly recognizable: from the deserts to the buildings, everything's represented in every small detail (Will this be the reason for a future Oscar prize?). Another thing that I particularly appreciated is that even all the characters are splendidly recreated, JUST LIKE Burroughs describes them in his book. The one I liked the most is Woola.Furthermore, to your surprise, you'll find out how amazingly the Martian culture's been reproduced. It was not easy to summarise in a 130 minutes lasting movie the thousands and thousands words that Burroughs spends describing the society of Mars and all its curiosities, but Disney and Pixar made it, with exceptional results.III- Actors on Mars In 'John Carter', many well-known actors set foot on Mars, and two of them particularly caught my attention: Taylor Kitsch and Daryl Sabara. Taylor Kitsch is perfect to play the role of a John Carter's modern version: He's not the usual heartless muscled man that too often we see in the movies. His face's fascinating, his expressions and his gestures are captivating. Actually I'm quite happy for this choice. Secondly, there's Daryl Sabara. He provides us with a tender interpretation of Edgar Rice Burroughs, that i deeply enjoyed. I don't know why but I think that no other actor could have played the role of Burroughs better than him. In fact, I loved the first part of the movie, totally dedicated to the famous author. Moreover, a special mention goes to Willem Dafoe, that plays the role of Tar Tarkas.IV- Music on Mars Or, in other words, ode to Michael Giacchino, who once again reveals to be one of the best composers ever. If you want to hear my favorite piece of music, you can find it as John Carter's official website's background music (www.johncartermovie.com). I suggest to buy the movie's soundtrack on Amazon, something that I always do with the best soundtracks I listen to. V- Mars in 3-D?This is probably the most annoying fact concerning the movie. The movie is in Disney Digital 3-D but...is the 3-D a good reason to spend some bucks more? In my opinion no, it's not. Apart from three or four nice 'pop up effects', during the projection you'll easily forget that you're watching a movie in 3-D. The 3-D technology is not mature enough yet: In all my life, I have never seen a movie (except, maybe, for Avatar and Hugo) in a great 3-D. VI- Finally, what's new in JC? Even though John Carter is from a three-centuries-old novel, it represent a fascinating attempt to bring to life one of the most captivating stories ever. Surely there are many sci-fi movies clichés (that's due to the period of time the novel the movie is based on was written), but it doesn't mean the movie is not highly enjoyable. You will laugh, you will cry (actually it depends on your 'sensibility level') and you will jump off your seat. What are you waiting for? Go and watch the sci-fi movie of the year.",John Carter
405,l-s-ross,Wonderfully entertaining movie!,10,12 March 2012,"With the fantasy and sci-fi that has been out in the last couple years I certainly didn't have my hopes up too high for this film. Was I ever surprised. It was such a pleasure to watch and so very entertaining. The acting was very good. The storyline was unusual and exciting. The computer graphics were grade ""A"" and it was just fun! I'm sure you have read previous reviews and by now have the story line so I don't need to go into that. Let's just say that if you see any movie this year, this is one you should definitely see. I know that as soon as it comes out on DVD, I will be buying it!

406,subspace2010,Excellent Old School Sci-Fi Classic,8,5 November 2012,"Why all the haters? I'll tell ya in one word, ""Disney"". In fact the marketing snafu around JC should be a textbook lesson in how not to market a movie. Disney went into panic mode with several name changes to the film and some horribly edited and confusing trailers after the apparent failure of films like Mars Needs Moms, Mission to Mars and Mars Attacks all OK movies in their own right with Mars Attacks becoming a cult classic. Whatever idiotic reasoning went into it, their poor marketing essentially killed their own movies' box office success. A self fulfilling prophecy if I ever saw one.Despite all of this the movie itself was surprisingly good. The acting was OK, the CGI, costume and set design were all excellent. In some scenes (like the wedding parade) you can really see why this movie cost over $250million. It's not a deep movie but it's definitely a unique, entertaining and well told yarn. Do yourself a favor, grab some popcorn, some 3D glasses, suspend your disbelief (quite a lot) and strap yourself in for a fun ride to our dusty little neighbor Mars.",John Carter

408,bluegattaca,Tries to be great but falls short,6,16 November 2015,This movie starts out pretty decent but then becomes very very boring and full of characters that I just don't care about. The only character I like was the creature that was like a dog and following them around everywhere. Evidently with a big budget film like this one most of it went into special effects and not writing in character development they show a few scenes from John's past but nothing really substantial that hits home for me. The special effects I must say are good. When you think the movie is going to end and everyone live happily ever after with the conjured romance of two people who don't even know each other at all he gets transported back and 10 years later is able to trick them and getting a medallion back and then the end he transports back but doesn't show anything after that. Probably trying to set up a sequel. Too much budget into special effects and thinking they can James Cameron this thing and make lots of money. Especially with a director that has only directed cartoon films.,John Carter

410,patstaciemcgue,Great Movie...must have a sequel!,10,17 August 2014,"Honestly, I had never really heard of John Carter due to Disney's poor promotion of this film. What an amazing film that should absolutely get a sequel. If no sequel is made for this movie, shame on Disney. The actors and producers of this film deserve better as this is the best sci-fi film I have seen in a very long time. This movie is all heart and action. The acting is superb and the special effects are awesome. My family loves this movie. The movie held our attention all the way through and the music is beautiful (Michael Giacchino of Lost fame) and should have won an academy award. Lynn Collins did an amazing job in this film. She's beautiful but does a stand up job of acting as does Taylor Kitsch as John Carter.I love the way the story is told in this film. With flashbacks, flash forwards, etc.. The aliens are very believable and likable. We have watched this movie several times in our home and we highly recommend it to anyone. Its the way movies used to be...full of heart and hero's.",John Carter
411,brofiteroles,Amazing film!! SPOILERS ARE UNDETAILED AND VAGUE.,9,23 June 2016,"I don't often favor Disney movies for the obvious reasons a 27yr old male doesn't favor a Disney movie. John Carter was on my IMDb watchlist for about 2 months before I finally decided to watch it, and I'm just bummed I didn't get to watching it sooner - however, the synopsis doesn't really do the film justice at all. And that's the reason I think it did so badly in the box office, here, let me have a go of it:John Carter is an ex-cavalrymen for the Confederate Army who accidentally sends himself to Mars through a portal. Different conditions, low gravity and his bone density, enables him to do amazing things that even surprise the Martians, like being able to jump to incredible heights or distances, and have a form of super-strength. After a lot convincing, the love of a beautiful Martian princess and a temporary dire situation, he uses his new abilities to lead an underdog army of green Martians to defeat the evil warlord (and his human looking army of Martians) and save the princess from a marriage to said warlord. Now, I would have watched this months ago, had it been described like that. Yes, it's very ""Disney-like"", saving the princess n'all but it wasn't the narrative that had my eyes glued to the screen, it was the story itself, the effects, camera work and the incredible job all the actors did. The single only reason I didn't vote this movie a 10 was because even at 2hrs 12mins long, it could have been longer. I wanted it to be longer, there were no plot holes, there was a beginning, middle and end, every character's story, no matter how deeply or vaguely, was covered, but like I said, I enjoyed the film immensely, so... It should have been longer!This movie is exactly how I like my films, original, light overtones, optimistic, lots of fighting and clean kills, protagonist always being the man of the hour, even when enslaved. It has an air of optimism about it, which is exactly what I'm all about, an expected yet happy ending, and plot surprises from start to finish, a love story, but not so much that the love becomes the anchor, the main focus and the reason for the continuation of the adventure. So in conclusion, if you like Space, aliens, (what would be) a handsome dude, a hot Martian chick (looks human but with markings on her body), super-human abilities, an immortal villain, an original story, or that heart swelling feel of unity (two 1000yr old warring species of Martians coming together to fight the antagonist army, cementing all future truces and treaties) then this movie is for you. I'm unsure as to whether this review was good enough to get people to watch, but you won't be disappointed.",John Carter
412,andersonenvy,How did this get made?,2,7 August 2013,"This has to be one of the silliest films I've ever seen. Words can't really describe: It really seems like the entire story and screenplay were written by a child... It reminds me of when I was a kid and would play with my action figures, and they'd be fighting monsters, but then they could fly, but then they'd save the princess, and then they'd teleport to other planets and stuff. And yet, even despite the sheer randomness of the plot, it ends up being completely predictable. I mean, from the very beginning we know Carter isn't really in the tomb, but come on you really just use the 'Rome and Juliet' cop-out? He literally just says ""Toxin. Derived from the Puffer-Fish. Simulates death."" That's how silly this movie is. I'm really not sure how this film was even green-lit, but it's no surprise that it set a few records for biggest movie flop of all time (the budget for this movie was $250,000,000 and it only earned $75,000). I just don't understand how this movie even exists.",John Carter
413,thedmoviebuff,this movie is so underrated. it seriously rocks!,10,14 July 2020,"I'm not sure what the deal is with the low rating but this is one of the best all-time fantasy/scifi movies ever. It's pretty much nonstop action all the way through. Excellent acting, great effects, awesome cinematography. Definitely worth a watch!",John Carter
414,gamskee,Surprisingly Good,10,10 March 2012,"I expected mostly spectacle, for John Carter to be nothing more than the story of an Earth Man kicking alien butt on another world, and I definitely got that. What I didn't expect was that the film did not pigeonhole it's tone to pure seriousness or pure camp. In effect, it felt closer to movies like Indiana Jones, Star Wars, and other great adventure films, with a mix of action, humor, and surprising depth of emotion at times.Usually when I see a film, I find something to complain about- a huge plot hole, a character taking an action I find far too unreasonably stupid, terrible acting, etc. And, I honestly didn't happen upon that. A lot of elements that could have came across as cliché and played out were skillfully executed to give them a spin I hadn't seen in years. Spoilers: John Carter himself could have mistakenly be put into the role of gravelly voiced reluctant savior who must be guilted in to saving people. Instead he was the man who was reluctant for war yet spurred in the moment to heroic action, he did not feel the part of the killer whose heart grows three sizes or the total dick, but a man with real issues in his past that overcomes his inner demons, accepting himself as the hero he was all along.Willem Dafoe as Tars Tarkis was well done, as he was what you would expect from a tribal warlord with redeeming qualities, yet he still had that savage edge. He was willing to inflict brutality to maintain order, yet guide with a wise hand where the law let him, making him come off as a more real political figure than he could have.The Thern- pretty god damn terrifying. Don't want to ruin it. But the way they are played up in the movie gives the whole film a grander and more terrifying scope.Deja Thoris as a character is interesting as while she is put in the Princess victim position, she doesn't sit idly by like some trophy to be exploited. She has real misgivings for her wedding, she's a scientist, she can fight, and yet doesn't come off as a mary sue or bad girl.The humor. The Tharks calling John Carter Virginia is pretty damn funny to start, and there's a lot of goofy moments to keep things from getting too serious business.If you don't like sci-fi or star wars, you won't like this film, but if you like either, I highly recommend it.",John Carter
415,EduardoSandrini79,Entertaining and better than expected,7,14 April 2012,"John Carter is a movie that is suffering from both a bad Marketing campaign prior to its release and schadenfreude for its flop status after being released in theaters.Living all that behind though, the movie is extremely entertaining, has stunning visuals and some really cool characters.The film's plot follows the story of a Civil War veteran, John Carter, that is transport to Mars.The visuals (special effects, locations, costume design) really deserve to be highlighted. Directed by the award winning Pixar director Andrew Stanton, the film is beautiful and one of the rare cases where 3D not only works but also has very little impact on the brightness of the movie (it also helps a lot the fact that the red Planet is a very bright one).The performances are not bad but they're also nothing special. This is mostly due to its source material (a pulp magazine from Edgar Rice Burroughs), where characters are defined by their actions.Despite that, this is not a big problem once the movie kicks into high gear. What really is the Achilles Heel of this film is its beginning.The movie presents the alien races in a tremendously confusing way in its opening scene, you can't really identify who is who. Then jumps to the 19th century USA to show the main character, John Carter, in the middle of a civil war. These first 10 minutes on Earth work very poorly to tell us who, where and when John Carter is. Not only it does a poor job in what it is supposed to do, but is also slow in pace (despite having many hectic scenes) and compromise the whole movie.When JC steps on Mars we have some of the most inspired moments of movie, when he is discovering the alien Planet. However, at this point, the spectator has already had around 15 uninteresting minutes that do not explain anything at all. The director should have shortened the prologue on Earth considerably, in order to improve the pace of the movie, or invested more time in really developing the background story of John Carter. And the prologue on Mars should have been completely ditched. The way it is, most of the moviegoers will be sleeping or will already be hating the movie by the time he reaches Mars.From that point on the movie, though not perfect, works much better and has some amazing action scenes. The only big problem, again compromising the pace of the film, during the rest of the projection is the subplot involving Sola and Tars Tarkas. Completely unnecessary it only makes the movie even longer for no good reason.All in all, if you're able to ignore all the hate towards this picture and forgive the first 15 minutes, you'll be able to have quite an enjoyable and fun evening watching Disney's John Carter of Mars.",John Carter
416,marineproductions1,This film is way underrated. It's a masterpiece in many aspects!,9,22 March 2012,"I saw the trailer, meh... then I saw the 10min footage. I realized this film is much more than what this trailer is showing me and I have to go see it. Then I told my friends I'm gonna go see it. They said don't see it. I said why? They said, there's bad review. I asked them did you see it? None of them said they did. I said the footage looked really good, so... ...I went to the theater. ...AND... This film is soooo good some of the scenes even made me cry. The director/writer truly understand story and what touches the audience's hart. All I can say is it has a stunningly beautiful story!!!! It's wayyyyyyyyyyyyy better than avatar! Not a lot of manufactored 3D junk movies have stories. And this one does! It's a rare film a masterpiece. Such a great film that I haven't seen for a long time!!! Go watch it! Don't listen to the non-sense reviews! Also make a different trailer! Don't show the bombing CGI scenes; put in the artistic storytelling scenes instead. Because the stronghold of this movie is not CGI but story. All the CGI (which is also fantastic) works for the purpose of the story. I'll be losing my hope on the sanity of the American audience if this movie flops because it's such a great film I haven't seen in a LONG TIME, since INCEPTION of 2010!!!!The design is fantastically apt to the film. The effect is as good as Avatar. The story is way better than Avatar. There are moments that made me cry in the theater. Director/Writer really know how to write good scenes and good plots and cut them together for the best cinematic experience that touches audience. The pacing is very good. A very well- done take of John Carter. But only a score of 7ish? and only 180M box office up till I wrote this review out of a budget of 250M? Many other 3D junk movies did better. This 3D movie has a truly marvellous story and a world view and cinematic story telling that touches and deserve a much better rating and much better receive.In my opinion this film deserves a rating around 8.5 and more. And should get more than 500M in box office.",John Carter
417,paul-tabet,Another lame US blockbuster for brainless viewers,3,19 May 2012,"With John Carter, the blockbuster industry comes up with yet another lame sci-fi flick where raw meaningless action teams with totally uninteresting theme / protagonists to give some of the worst movies ever produced...Apparently, making high end CGI 3D movies is a winner since there is no use anymore for charismatic characters with a PSYCHOLOGY, neither for a plot ( apart from having the world being saved again and again by... an all American hero ) but only for dull action moments and ubber-cheesy talk ( me lovely good princess don't want to marry the bad guy who's sooo mean to everyone ).No spoilers ahead, this movie is once again a 90% copy of all the late failures which have rotten my screen lately : from Avatar to the Avengers, it's always the same : more action, more CGI, more blow your eyes with explosions, and less of everything else that has made good movies for over 100 years.Few very good actors ( from the Rome series actually, my favorite all timer ) share the green CGI background with voices of good actors badly used and with one of the dullest actors living ( come on, the guy from Wolverine with his cards and his wand ? ) cannot do anything to raise the level of this piece of crap, but I imagine even good actors need a very bad blockbuster role sometime in order to pay the rent.All these guys look like morons in their capes and robes, speaking martian gibberish ! Maybe I'll watch 2001 - A space odyssey in order to wash myself.Tasteless and senseless - avoid !",John Carter

I give a 10/10.The movie is meant to surprise you the whole time. You just wonder what'll happen along the way. You get the feeling someone is reading you a fairy tail and you don't want to go to sleep until you get the story. Agony, Frustration, Despair, brilliant soundtrack, Very nice Visual Effects part from some CGI that looked a bit fake. I recommend to watch it in HD.Originality in story progression is one of the things I would say this movie has. And I really can't say that for many movies of 2012 or older. Watch it with Friends, or Family. It was a very enjoyable movie.",John Carter
419,ScottM2753,"Great Fun, but not too faithful to the Original ERB Stories",8,7 April 2013,"I must say, as an avid fan of the stories written by Edgar Rice Burroughs while growing up, I was chomping at the bits upon the announcement of this film! I hurriedly started re-reading the Kindle version of the 7 novels I had read as a child - Princess of Mars, Gods of Mars, Warlord of Mars, Thuvia-Maid of Mars, Chessman of Mars, Mastermind of Mars & Fighting Man of Mars. There, done, now I was ready for when the movie came out to the theaters...Well I will say, that the film and effects were REALLY well done, beautiful scenery, gorgeous and very believable models/CGI effects, but perhaps as I was such a fan of the original I was disappointed with some of the very crucial changes written into the film.I will not go into the changes, as that would result in a spoiler alert, and I do hate spoilers, all I would suggest is 'if' you want, read the books, and you will see of what I speak.... Certain things that were left out led to drastic changes in the basic fight of John Carter after his initial 'landing' on Mars, which would have led to perhaps a longer movie, but also could have led the studio directly and much easier into a sequel... which I would love to see.",John Carter
420,Pithyoneliner,Highly mediocre action adventure,6,22 May 2012,"John Carter is an exercise in mediocrity, it's not a bad film, diverting enough for a rainy Sunday afternoon but don't get your hopes up of a 'spectacular sci-fi epic' or whatever else the paid bloggers have written on this site (guys reign it in a bit, you'll be more credible if your praise is a little more muted).The film is indeed reminiscent of Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers and the suchlike vintage sci-fi, in that the effects seem a little dated the science of 'sci-fi' less credible (although I assume true to the source material), but it is lacking the high camp that made Flash great - this movie would really have benefited from a Freddy Mercury soundtrack...I had high hopes of a great cast, having loved them in their previous work (John Carter reunites most of the cast of 'Rome') and they do OK, but only OK. The film only really comes alive when Mark Strong is on screen, by far the stand out performance and who seems to be the only actor who is really trying.As for our central protagonist, John Carter himself, didn't really develop any affection either for the character or the actor.But the film potters along, dutifully providing the requisite explosions, jumping and shouting and even throws in a few 'noble savages'. And it is worth a watch, on DVD, when there's nothing else on.** A note to the promoters, I am entirely lacking in principles and backbone. I am willing to re-write this review singing it's praises for a modest fee.",John Carter
421,fatal_coates,John Carter (of Mars),8,1 May 2012,"A great movie that's a little overlong but visually a sight to behold. Unfortunately it will need to ride on luck to get it's sequel.. asA: there was poor promotional work by Disney's marketing team.. B: a title that not many people from ""this"" century can relate AND C: the fact that Disney spent 250 million making the film and it has so far, barely raked in 180 million.. That's a major loss!The movie originates from the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel ""A Princess of Mars"" which is the first of many books in the series.The novels are a source of inspiration for George Lucas and James Cameron in their childhood and you can see quite clearly where a lot of their work comes from in this feature. So after all this time, not so grand an imagination you have Georgie boy! ;)I could not help, spotting so many familiar faces in the film and hear familiar voices (of the aliens) throughout. To start with...John Carter ~ Taylor Kitsch (Gambit from Wolverine Origins) Lead female ~ Lynn Collins (Kayla from Wolverine Origins)Carter's nemesis ~ Dominic West (Centurion, Hannibal Rising) Willem Dafoe & Ned from Ned & Stacey as Tribal aliens.. both of whom also play enemies of Spiderman in the older movies.Mark Strong (very similar role to Lord Blackwood in Sherlock H.) Bryan Cranston (Malcolm in the Middle and star of Breaking Bad) James Purefoy (Resident Evil, Solomon Kane and A Knight's Tale)and finally Daryl Sabara (most would know as the boy in Spy Kids)The special effects are amazing but ""DO NOT"" see this movie in 3D. I'm not quite sure, but I think it's a post production job or it's just been made really poorly. A real let down. ONLY see it in 2D.The story line is a lot to take in, and you may have trouble following it to begin with but if you ride the movie the entire way through.. it's well worth the ending which eventually sorts out where it's going, and hasn't all just been for nothing.Unfortunately not many read my reviews and I doubt many will actually see this film, so it may end up a one off.. Which is quite sad when sh*t like the ""Twilight"" series can get another look in..Go see it if you love Star Wars and Sci Fi in general and if want to see the weird and wonderful views of an Author who lived over a century ago, with no knowledge of our future. There are many scenes reminiscent of Attack of the Clones & Revenge of the Sith.In final. The ""Dog"" character is worth seeing, just for ""it"" alone :)",John Carter

I read this book and next one, movie based on, somewhat twenty years ago, found it at my grandfather's. It was written in unfamiliar to me style, kinda strange phrase construction. And i still remember it's heroes, their decisions, even some passages.
This movie isn't complete retell. They added enough bits of changes: jokes, visualisations, pace.
Jokes sometimes silly, protagonist regularly looks like an idiot, princess isn't what i was expecting at all.

Technically I was rather disappointed with the wide angle shots of the vast expanse of Mars with the characters matted into these shots looking slightly out of proportion to their surroundings, the model making looked like models and let down the overall look of this film. John Carter looked like a hobbit in some scenes next to the 12 foot aliens... it just didn't look real to me. The film has its good points as well, some nice CGI, the acting is fine, but the film unfortunately lacks a certain realism which i missed. would i recommend this film, yes, its a good pop corn film which i would have been happy watching without the 3D. I don't think this film was shot 3D but converted in post production. Overall this film did not live up to my expectations, but still worth a look as this is only my opinion.",John Carter

428,DrSkyTower,What The f**k?,1,29 March 2012,"Is this Disney's answer to Avatar?The plot:Princess has to marry some guy she doesn't like. Princess runs away. Princess is rescued by Earthman. Princess marries Earthman.Disney mashes this to death, making a very simple Point A to B plot go round and round in circles, just filled with words like ""Zen Jeddaak"", ""Barsoom"", ""Jarsoom"" and ""Helium"". This collection of nonsense words is used often during the many sanctimonious speeches that are spewed from every single character's mouth (even the minor ones!) throughout this movie.The audience is just expected to understand what in the hell is going on once the superhero lands on Mars. Nothing makes sense. The heroes visit places and monuments, all of which do utterly nothing to add to the story. There's a fight with giant white beasts, the outcome of which is 100% predictable the night before they get tossed in the arena. Disney could've at least killed off the Dad alien to the giant dumb, CGI monkey-things.I still don't get why the skinny green aliens kill the hatchlings (their young?). Something to do with some other tribe getting their hands on them. Or something. Or why a green four armed alien with tusks suddenly befriends the skinny, hairy Earth man. A few speeches later, and this scrawny hairy ape guy from Earth is a tribe warrior, the best in the whole clan, after just one day on Mars. No Mars airship - even one a kilometer in the air - is safe from the tiny Earth gnat leaping like a flea all over the place armed with two swords! Nothing more imposing than seeing this in 3D, and trying hard to suspend disbelief while watching it, so the 3D glasses keep my eyes from rolling right out of my head as I face palm.Airships have wings that obviously uses solar energy to power themselves. But our hero can make them fly at night when no airship can possibly fly... just closer to the ground, because well... no sunlight? Whut?? Face palm.Disney's lucked out here.

I listened to reviewers, and stayed away from the theater for this one. Mistake. HUGE mistake. Now I want to see this on the big screen in full sound, color and Special FX, but it's too late. This was a redbox rental, I am ashamed to say. At least I got it on blu-ray. (We kept it two nights...does that help, Disney? Of course it doesn't help.) This was a flop because it wasn't given a proper introduction or chance. People needed to be told the back-story a bit more to understand the concept of a turn-of-the-LAST-century, sci-fi before-it-was-called sci-fi, EPIC ADVENTURE story...and that may be the key: STORY. It actually HAD one.My husband and son were constantly finding parts of their favorite films throughout the production: Avatar, Gladiator, Indiana Jones, The Outlaw Josie Wales, MIB, Somewhere In Time, The Wizard of Oz, K-PAX, Superman-even Sherlock Holmes and Gone with the Wind. John Carter is ALL of these, and something more...it was written in 1917...it pre-dates ALL of them. Edgar Rice Burroughs was a genius, and I really wish Disney would release this one again...maybe wait five years, until people are REALLY sick of the sixth installment of Transformers or something, and want to THINK for a change. Meanwhile (and I know this won't happen, because EVERYTHING is decided by bean-counters these days, and technically, this film failed) I wish Disney would pick up where this left off, and do John Carter 2, 3, 4...etc.Hopefully it's not too late to qualify for a few awards.

430,kroolshooz,Will the real John Carter please stand up,5,11 March 2012,"Others have commented on the qualities of this movie, which is so-so, but I just have to express my continued resentment at Hollywood for using the names of literary characters for movies about completely unrelated characters.The John Carter character in this movie bears little resemblance to the John Carter of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Why do movie makers do this ALL THE TIME? If you want to make up your own character - DO IT! Call it ""Bill Smith of Mars,"" or ""Fred the Barbarian."" Stop taking great classic characters like John Carter and Conan and wrecking them! Change whatever else you need in the plot to make it work as a movie, but at least - for the love of God - leave the character intact, or what's the point? John Carter was a genuine early 20th-century hero, chivalrous and honorable to a fault, with no dark, haunted past. They just HAD to make the movie John Carter into a late 20th-century antihero with a troubled soul...the kind of guy that would yank a woman off her horse and make her walk across the desert just to prove his point. Burroughs' John Carter would have fallen on his sword before treating a woman like that, and wouldn't have hesitated for one second to defend a good cause. This old-fashioned honor and chivalry was the ESSENCE of Burroughs' John Carter, the gentleman from Virginia.The funny thing about the late 20th-century antihero is that it was a reaction to the cliché of the ""classic"" hero that had been worked to death, largely in Westerns, up through the 1950s. Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name upended the old stereotypes, and from the early 1960s on, almost every movie protagonist had to be a dark, brooding, antihero. The thing is...and listen up movie makers...the DARK BROODING ANTIHERO IS NOW THE Cliché!! It's been 50 years now of the same freaking character in every movie, for God's sake. The irony of the John Carter movie is that if they had made him the old-fashioned hero that he originally was, with no dark side, no murdered family haunting his memories, no ambivalent attitude toward society, THAT would have been breaking the cliché! An old-fashioned, chivalrous, Virginia gentleman on Mars...maybe even with a Virginia accent...would actually have been a breath of fresh air and would have made the character memorable and distinctive. Instead, same ol' same ol'.",John Carter

It has some pretty good action sequences also, which I feel in a few parts could've have been a little longer but still good. One of my favorite parts of the movie though is the humor it is not something I went in expecting, but there is a good amount of classy slapstick comedy that gives a good laugh. Where the movie slips is in the plot element. I went in just to watch a feel good movie which I got but the plot felt very fast paced and choppy in parts it goes through quite a few moments of wait why are they showing this or how is this important. The acting in a few scenes is very drab as well.

I read some reviews on John Carter and dismissed it as yet another visual galore without substance, trying to milk the summer audiences when it was released last year.Today I finally got the chance to see it and boy was I wrong. This film roots itself on simple, even cheesy (yet very likable) ingredients that mesh into a fun ride. Although predictable, watching it with very low expectations had me filled with surprise after surprise as the story unfolded. I came to love the score, the characters and their tried and proved development arch and the VFX (they are pretty good and they serve the story, not a single action scene is trown in simply for the eye candy.Really fun, don't miss it.",John Carter

I don't understand the low IMDb rating because it has everything with the possible exception of a famous named leading actor. What I like most is the unpredictability of the action. Generally speaking I can second guess the theme, storyline and ending of most films. In this case I could not. Even when viewing a second and third time the story was thrilling. One things for sure, I did not see the end coming. A bonus for me were the supporting actors Ceiren Hinds and James Purefoy recreating Julius Ceaser and Mark Anthony ... Amazing ...

I knew nothing about the Burroughs story (except that the Frazetta artwork was much appreciated as an adolescent male), and the film trailers gave me the impression that it would be a couple of hours of glitzy special effects but with little substance to the story. Fortunately, a boring Sunday was motivation enough to go and end up being quite pleased by a story that was exciting, engaging and even at times endearing. For the first time in a good while, I left the theater wanting more (and the story line certainly leaves itself open for a sequel). The film has a good look and feel (somewhere I read where a reviewer aptly described it as steam-punk meets Star Wars), and the performances had me believing in the plight of the characters. That it won me over in spite of my initial skepticism and that it made me crave more pushed my rating to a 9. Don't get me wrong, this is not high art. But at least, in my opinion, this met its mark better than other similar films such as Avatar. (I never quite forgave the Avatar hero for abandoning his first flying reptile).",John Carter

Really good movie i enjoyed a lot and hardly eat my cereals cos I did not want to lose any of the details.John Carter takes Mars related movies to a whole other level, without people wondering on a deserted planet and killing one another to see who gets back home, but it has a human story with human feelings and a really good plot regarding the power balance and if this power balance is really decided through victories and defeats or already the games are being made by other high instances. Maybe some wars need to be won by certain sides and it goes like this before our planet even existed. I mean the Matai Shang makes a good point if you want to think beyond the fantasy of this movie. But sometime a hero appears who blows all the game in the air and rewrites everything and this is why I am saying.....can someone get Nick Fury to recruit this guy?

443,wizardlord-1,Great movie! Amazing visual effects! Negative reviews are misleading.,7,17 June 2012,"Because of the mixed reception and big budget, I was curious to see what John Carter was all about. I watched this movie without any high expectations and was pleasantly surprised. John Carter certainly entertained me and exceeded my expectations.John Carter is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel - A Princess of Mars. I haven't read the books and based on the reviews on the internet, the fans of the book seem to be disappointed. Nevertheless, I wanted to see why a $250 million big budget movie failed to hit the expected mark in the box office. In the end, it didn't really matter because I had 2 hours of fun and the money I spent was worth it. The best aspects of the movie are spectacular cinematography and stunning visual effects. The special effects seamlessly blends with the background, giving the viewer a sense of reality in a surreal world. The story flowed smoothly and kept me engaged throughout the movie. I enjoyed the movie for what it was, and didn't worry about what it was not. To me, the movie is more of a fairy tale that both kids and adults can enjoy. It is not a serious science fiction movie. The characters in Barsoom are diverse and exotic, have interesting personalities, are funny and likable. Woola, the giant lizard-toad dog is an ugly beast and yet it is cute and almost steals the show. Unlike stereotypical aliens in Sci-Fi movies, whose sole intention is to kill or breed with humans, creating hybrids who also want to kills humans, Barsoomians are a welcome break. They show a wide range of emotions and have an interesting culture and lifestyle. There are human like species as well as 15 feet tall green martians. Couple of different hordes of the green martians are shown in the movie, the Tharks and the Warhoons. The lead actors, Taylor Kitsch (John Carter) and Lynn Collins (Dejah Thoris) are convincing in their respective roles.Overall, John Carter delivers two hours of cinema escapism filled with fun, action and adventure.",John Carter

I was initially just satisfied with the movie, nothing exceptional but definitively good. Then I read the books again and when the DVD came out I saw the movie again....and I have to admit I liked it more than the first time. Actors selection is great and the entire story is really well written. Effects and editing were of course very good the first time, but only if you see it again you can appreciate the music and the emotions running in the whole movie. Long story short is a great movie, overwhelming the first time (really 2 books with other pieces of Burroughs saga in one movie was not easy) but if you have the chance give it another shot. It's definitively worth it !",John Carter
445,ryan-craven,John Carter deserves more credit than it is receiving.,9,29 March 2012,"Andrew Stanton, fresh from 2 successful and rather good Pixar movies, makes a comfortable and competent move into live action film making, with an emotionally resonant thrill ride that is fun, fast and charming. Granted, there are a few flaws, as there always are with ma-hoo-sive blockbusters. The opening resembles that of a poorly executed, slap-dash Sci-Fi TV show, airing on FX, and there could be more romance establishing scenes between the 2 excellent leads, but once John Carter becomes of Mars, it becomes something wholly remarkable. Taylor Kitsch has a lot to prove this summer, with this and Battleship, coming this April, and he doesn't disappoint, giving the titular character gruff charisma, dry humour and gives the film steely and reliable foundations. Lynn Collins also makes for a convincing and sexy warrior princess, whilst Mark Strong continues his consistent run as manipulator/villain routine.Where Stanton really succeeds is in making a fantastic world that matches Pandora on every visceral level.

Nobody knows what this movie is about or who John Carter is or why we should care. I didn't know it was supposed to be on Mars even. I don't know anything about the story and I think most people are like my in that area.With all the posters, commercials etc why did they never say what the story was or who this guy is?

Get real, the marketing on this movie is maybe the worst ever.Anyway the story is okay (better than Avatar but still kind of basic and thin) but the effects really are tremendous, if you like effects then I definitely would say you should go see this movie while you can in 3D which might not be for long because the rate this movie is flopping it will be pulled from theaters at any minute, wish I was joking.",John Carter
447,unimatrix972,An old Sci-fi tale with a good 21st century touch,9,14 March 2012,"When you read the title ""John Carter"" it does not say much. Who is John Carter? What's so special about him? The trailer also does not give you much hint on what the story is all about. The original story is from the beginning of the 20th century, however, the movie is neither dull nor retro. It is a very good movie with a thrilling storyline and good rhythm. I really enjoyed seeing the origin of familiar Sci-Fi concepts, as it was drafted over a 100 years ago.Considering the original story spans over several books, the movie script compacted it pretty nicely, and a friend of mine who read the books would vouch that it has been packed with relatively few mistakes or shortcuts. The characters have depth despite the time limitations of a single movie, and a bits of acting here and there.Of course, the special effects take a significant role in the movie, but not at the expense of the story. The CGI characters were skillfully modeled and the interaction with the flesh and blood actor was pretty ""realistic"". Yet, one annoying thing is the 3D (at least the version I saw was 3D), and in my opinion, too many movies were already produced in 3D or with a 3D version, that it's getting tiresome, and it doesn't enhance the experience anymore.I must admit I also enjoyed the landscape scenery, though I have no idea if it was filmed at a real location or it was computer created.Overall, very pleasant experience.",John Carter

Did the critics ever actually watch the film??? Mind you going on the Oscars and the winners there I can see why this did not fare well. I mean this is actually a great enjoyable film.I wont give the story away or leave any spoilers. I will say this is the best film I have seen in over a year and I CANNOT wait to buy this on blu-ray. I hope they continue the series and I look forward to seeing more of the leading actors.Great film, with fantastic effects, great acting and a superb plot. Will no doubt go down as a classic over time. If you want to take the kids out to see a great action adventure or you just fancy escaping the drool of everyday life, go for a trip to Bassoon and explore a great new world with some interesting characters.Just because something has been done before does not mean it cannot be done better John Carter......Simply stunning",John Carter
449,LawlessLegacy,Excellent Sci-Fi,9,23 May 2012,"Wasn't sure what to expect with this film based on the current 6.9 rating but I was more than pleasantly surprised. Excellent story line, plenty of action and quite a few comedic moments. What more can you ask for? John Carter gets teleported from Earth to Mars where the planets gravity is considerably weaker. This allows John Carter to jump higher and run faster, not to mention his increased strength. Some of my favourite films are about individuals who obtain some sort of power. I still don't understand why its current rating is so low. The only negative aspect I could see some people having is the length of the movie, which in my opinion was too short. I think they could have easily extended it by another half an hour.I hope they make a sequel. This will definitely be added to my blu-ray collection.",John Carter

In a strange way, this film brought a little of both. I had never read any of Burroughs' sci-fi books, though with hindsight, I realise that basing the film on the works of such a classic writer was bound to give it strength, - even depth. The film came across to me as a little like Dan Dare, or Jules Verne in format, with even a few notional echoes of C.S.Lewis ""Out of the Silent Planet"" (the sequel to which I -long- to see in film). Whilst it is hardly the sort of tale you might actually believe, it avoided many of those annoying plot shortcuts that make such a burden out of suspending disbelief -sufficiently- to enjoy watching it. This included some recognition of gravity, body types, language and technology that are different to our own. The characters and cultures were also less than superficial on the whole, but perhaps most of all, I found them likable. Although the conclusion wasn't too hard to guess, I was quite pleased to see it work out that way.But the one thing it didn't remind me of was Star Wars!I for one would love to see the sequels, or at least the realisation of more classic sci-fi like this. I will now buy the Blu-ray.",John Carter
452,stantonchris4,Not great but I still liked watching it,6,3 June 2013,"This is considered one of the biggest box office failures of all time. Why? Because It didn't much hype, the advertising wasn't great, and for the most part people just kinda shrugged at it. Well, I thought it was a good film. not great but good.OK heres what I like about this film. I thought the visuals were really impressive and I like Disney's ideas of visiting new worlds.and for the most part, the fight scenes between the aliens, and human vs human actually worked out pretty well. There were some things about the film that I didn't like though. For the most part, I feel like the story about an unlikely hero who meets a princess who is forced to marry someone has been done too many times. I do know they did a different take on it, but come on, we've all seen this story a million times. Some of the characters were also pretty forgettable. The leading lady, while being able to fight for herself, is really not that interesting and she kinda got annoying at times. I also remember the plot being kind of confusing because I was really wondering how the heck the alien species was in any way related to the two races of people. It's explained a little but not very well. Well,Despite its flaws, I really just found it a fun, dumb, cheesy sci fi transformers type flick but with a little more story.Not Andrew Stanton's best movie, but I still had fun watching it.",John Carter

There was hardly a plot and it depended on Special Effects to guide the movie. How pathetic! How else can I express my dislike for this movie other than it needed to never been made. Hollywood has hit a new low! John Carter is nothing more than trying to ride the success of Start Wars, Star Trek, Avitar, and other successful films that were a lot better than this film. That is saying something because Avitar is one of the most unoriginal movies ever made. What else can I say than to warn people to not waste their money by going to see this film?

Before James Cameron, Steven Spielberg and Lucas parents were even born.They got some of their ideas from Edgar Rice Burroughs, not the other way around.The film did have some updated ideas to make it a bit more exciting for younger watchers.

459,zinglorion,"decent film, good, poor character development",6,9 March 2012,"So I just saw the film. Pretty solid CG and FX, I did enjoy the on screen magic thoroughly. For those who don't know this movie was based on a scifi novel waaaayyy, ahead of its time by E.R. Burroughs. I think for the money Disney has spent on marketing and hype this movie will end up merely being a flash in the pan. The movie follows John Carter a former confederate soldier out trying to find gold in Arizona. Different than the book as he's apparently a miserable widower getting run down by the authorities constantly. Finds cave. Mysteriously transported to ""Barsoom""(Mars) Meets the 4 armed Tharks. Yadda yadda. Entertaining flic, I gave it a 6. Far from the epics of Star Wars and Avatar which followed E. Burroughs formula. The movie moved along too rapidly to connect emotionally to the characters and even with the world and its stark differences from earth. Truthfully a bit disappointed in this screen adaptation of such a classic, however, it does beat the hell out of ""Princess of Mars"" which was based on the novels also. Anyway, catch on DVD when it comes out. Doesn't live up to the novels or hype.",John Carter
460,jjeffrey,Burroughs' Mars gets the movie it deserves,9,11 March 2012,"As a small child, I was captivated by Edgar Rice Burroughs' stories of Barsoom and they are probably the reason I have spent half a century enjoying sci-fantasy movies. Many of these owe a huge debt to Burroughs but present their own vision of imagined worlds and peoples (think Flash Gordon, Star Wars, Dune...), but none offers a visualisation of the much-loved original...till now (OK, let's pretend that 'Princess of Mars' (2009) was just a bad dream)! While 'John Carter' is an unpromising title for an adaptation of 'A Princess of Mars' and while it strays from the basic plot in many ways, it stays true to the spirit of the books in the way which few adaptations do. There must have been enormous commercial pressures to meddle with the essentially simple tale of heroism and wonder, but it is to Disney's credit that their movie has been allowed to write such a vivid love-letter to early 20th Century pulp fiction.There is a danger - and some reviews already show this - that JC's authenticity may be confused with plagiarism. The design work stays gloriously true to the kind of lurid cover illustrations that adorned the books. This in itself may make some see it as ripping off earlier films whereas they were themselves in thrall to these kinds of evocations of the exotic palaces and people of Barsoom - how many people will see Dejah Thoris's wedding outfit and think Princess Leia, for instance? Perhaps JC's integrity may prove its undoing. When James Purefoy shows up to aid Carter he looks like he has strayed from the set of Rome and one can imagine a lot of people saying they've seen it all before. But the key to the books' success is also here in abundance: it is a ripping yarn where the hero is brave, the heroine is beautiful and worth saving and the dog (Woola)may be ugly but he always has the hero's back and is loyal as can be. They really don't make 'em like this any more or they didn't until now.Any complaints? Not about the changes to the plot: the whole teleportation device / evil 'gods' storyline works well. But the 3D makes the night battle sequence a bit more subdued than it should be.Here's hoping that Burroughs' simple pleasures make this film a success at the box office despite the sniping. This could be the next great franchise and I'm all for it! In fact, I'm looking forward to 'The Gods of Mars' and 'The Warlord of Mars' already!",John Carter

Exciting, action packed. I knew of the John Carter of Mars books when some of my friends talked about them. However, when I first hear ""John Carter"", I thought of Noah Wiley's character Dr. John Carter on ""E.R."" The title and promotional material fell short descriptively. The title needed to convey that this was 19th century Sci-Fi, like a story from Jules Verne or H.G. Wells. I have the suspicion that someone a Disney wanted this project to fail in order to necessitate Disney's eventual purchase of Lucas Films. Someone had a private agenda that was served at the expense of this movie, film makers, and stockholders. The fact that this movie did very well abroad is an indication that the problem was in promotion, not production. Let's hope for a sequel soon. It is worthy of it.",John Carter

Granted, it had the feel of a 1950s, early 1960s movie experience, but those films were not all bad and besides when they were done well, they could be extremely ENTERTAINING and worth the admission and visit to the concession stand.

I have never read the books, however after seeing the film today, I am going to to buy my copy in the next few days. It is amazing to think that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote such a detailed account of an amazing SCI FI adventure, really did blow me away.Also have to say this is the first film that I have seen in 3D that feels like it belongs in 3D, its not forced on you, it feels natural, like its part of your environment... So far other 3D films have made me feel like I want to leave, however this made me feel right at home...I gave it 10 out of 10 because this series of books started the SCI FI series that we know and love today, I hope we get to see the rest of the series of books made into film soon, as I would love to see the complete story told...I cannot wait for the next episode!!!One last thing, when you do go watch this, remember it was written over 100 years ago!",John Carter

It's a good, solid movie. Great production (this is one of those movies where you can see all of the money on the screen), well-rendered effects (not just the character work and environments, but the great combination of locations with the digital work- besides it's ALWAYS awesome to see Lake Powell standing in for an otherworldly location ), solid and enthusiastic performances(the lead had to work hard to convince me in this part but by the end of it he had), good score, decently paced (never looked at the time during it's run) and...no spoiler to say that while it's left open for further adventures, it also works as a stand-alone movie.Now, I saw it in 2D (my preference) and I thought it looked and sounded great. Sadly though, there were only about ten other people in the theater. I hope good word-of-mouth helps this movie. It's another example for me how I end up really enjoying something that most mainstream critics just used to sharpen their claws on.If this movie bombs, the folks at Disney should dump their clueless publicity department (the promos for this have been bloody awful)...everyone involved in actually making this movie was obviously into creating something special and it shows...Great film....I'll see it on the big screen again...",John Carter

The main character, JC or Virginia as the natives call him strolls effortlessly through the endless CGI and the acting is pretty sound. Most British viewers will recognise a lot of the Actors, though quite why the leading lady speaks with an English accent Im not sure( shes a Texan ).The only real negative for me was the similarities to Star Wars characters( Ep1 etc).That aside if you want to watch an entertaining fantasy adventure that's full of CGI and has no sort of real story you could do a lot worse.

I wanted more on the origin of the Therns as the movie made them not of mars and what their interest was with earth and the transportation system explained more. Does it only make a copy of John Carter ? and why can the Therns travel in real time ?? whereas John Carter woke up seemingly asleep for half a year. Anyway with the matter over the title it just says John Carter , and throughout the move John Carter keeps saying he is from earth , then at the end he decides he is now John Carter of Mars and the movie title at the end confirms this.

If you've ever actually READ the series, by the great sci-fi writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, you know that there's a wealth of detail in these stories, which could rival LOTR or Harry Potter.DO NOT confuse this one with a lame attempt made some time ago, called ""A Princess of Mars."" It ""starreed"" Traci Lord, who may have been hot stuff in the porn biz but didn't have the looks to be Deja, nor could she act her way out of a paper bag.

It had worst time to go to movies 18.10h, so I had to make preparations to go to watch it, and, finally, when I was ready, they stopped presenting it, maybe scared by America's box results.Then, I was forced to to over net to see if there is some good copy to watch it.All my companions have been astonished dearly with it, yet I was really doubtful, before watching, because I read E.R.B. original novel, and I was not that astonished.What to say?

I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a very enjoyable, very well made, movie. I don't think it will ever become a sci-fi classic, but it is, without any doubt, a movie to be recommended.I won't go into the special effects, for with a $200M budget, special effects are bound to be top-notch - as they are. I found the acting competent all right, and watching a gorgeous woman like Lynn Collins on the screen is a feast to the eyes.

But I think that with a different company and R rating it would have been even better than it was and how it was first received, it also could've been done with half of what it was being paid for. All you need is some writers, producers, actors and a director that really love the original Burroughs stories and also are able to present this character to a whole new generation of fans and it would become a huge movie in the sci-Fi genre.

475,deadlypen,Fails On Almost Every Level,1,29 November 2012,"I have read all of the 'John Carter' books many times - both as an impressionable boy and as a more demanding adult, so I came to this movie with all the enthusiasm of a fan who has waited a lifetime to see Barsoom on the big screen. I did not expect the script to stick rigidly to the first novel in the series - after all, movies have different rules and perspectives - but I was surprised and disappointed to see that the motion picture merely scratched the surface E.R. Burrough's plots & story arcs. As the movie uses the novels' characters, but largely imposes its own motivations and directions upon them, it is pretty pointless attempting to review this film as an adaptation of any of the books...so I will briefly state that the leading man has all the drive and charisma of a wet noodle; the supporting characters are just as shallow and unlikeable - those rendered in CGI are entirely unbelievable as living things (they are manifestly not 'real'). The script is incomprehensible, larded with stilted, stagey dialogue and too awful to be rescued by any even moderately-talented actor who might have slipped past the Producers'determination to cast members of the talent-challenged community. Burroughs' Barsoom is, of course, a fantasy world, but it offers plausible (if sometimes fantastical) cultures and societal mechanisms; his conception of the Barsoomian 'heaven' is dark, ironic and oddly predictive of some of the religious cults which emerged in the latter part of the 20th Century. The movie throws out these intelligent, compelling factors and offers a different, wholly dumbed-down & generally incoherent set of explanations. The huge budget did not produce a good movie. I would be pushing the truth to describe it as a mediocre movie. It is an expensive turkey which attempts to lay down enough teenager-friendly plot lines to spark a series, but ultimately sinks under its own weight of inconsistencies. Perhaps the most depressing aspect of 'John Carter' on IMDb is the number of belated, inflated 10/10 puff-piece reviews from studio stooges who wish to boost the movie's rating.

I took my sister to see the movie for her 69th birthday and we both enjoyed it immensely. It was extremely difficult to not regress to childhood and kick the backs of the seats and throw popcorn as we did when watching Tarzan movies those many, many years ago.

Unlike other alien movies, say avatar, this one is different. For some reason i cannot explain the ""different"" but trust me it is different in a good way.

Star Wars, Avatar, and many other successful science fantasy films owe something to Burroughs, and unfortunately those films beat Carter to the punch, so audiences may feel they are seeing something derivative of those franchises. And, in the production sense at least, they may be right.Carter is at its best when the action is fast and the fun is light, with laughs mixed in with the punches and swordplay. A well crafted intro gives us an idea of who Captain John Carter is and what makes him an unlikely hero. Sadly, once transported to Mars (known by its inhabitants as Barsoom) the plot falls to tedium, with few action scenes separated by never-ending and never convincing ""romance"" between Carter and Dejah, the titular Princess of Burroughs' tale. The two (Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins) are so bad every scene between them is like a prompt to check your watch. Each of Carter and Dejah's tedious conversation is like hearing a weird conversation between a crappy Batman and Hamlet's Ophelia. The dialogue doesn't help; billboards don't have words this stiff.The supporting cast is good enough to make an effort at saving the film. Ciaran Hinds, Dominic West, James Purefoy, Mark Strong, and even Willem Dafoe are all present and doing their best. But it's Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston who practically makes the film's opening all on his own. Unfortunately, these terrific performers are used to little effect, and the film suffers for it.Production design for the film is a mixed bag. Visual effects are astounding, but costume design is weak. So in some scenes you have ridiculous looking actors boring you in front of beautiful backdrops or in incredible set pieces. Sound design is not good, and the score is downright pitiful. As much as the movie wants to be Star Wars, it just can't match Lucas' ability in that film to pull together the best of everyone at their jobs, creating a movie that looks and sounds gorgeous and works well together. Carter is more piecemeal, with a good quality here and a ruinous disaster there, a hodgepodge of the best and worst Disney could muster. Director Andrew Stanton, known primarily for his work on fantastic Pixar productions like Wall-E and Finding Nemo, surely gets the blame here. Though I've loved his animated features, not all directors of animation are ready for live action (as proved only recently by Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol).As a throwaway popcorn muncher for the kids, this movie might prove a winner. The simple inch-deep characters and the generic comedy/action certainly seemed fun enough as long as you're not looking for more. But my warning to adults who decide to take the kids is to expect to be bored, and endure a long dark two hours of the soul.Rating: 2.5/5 Recommendation: Wait for cable.

482,Isheru,Not as good as i expected,3,12 March 2012,"First of all, if i hadn't read the reviews on IMDb i would mostly gave this movie at least an 8 but because most of the reviews were describing this movie as Avatar of 2012 or the new star wars and some stated its a combination of the best of both star wars and avatar. i went to see it with high expectations but i was so disappointed this movie is no where near avatar nor star wars. yes its a combination of both but not as good not even close. so piece of advice don't have high hopes this is one of the movies where in order to enjoy you shouldn't read the reviews. still it will be a block buster nevertheless.enjoy the movie and tell me what do you think",John Carter
483,chrisst4,Epic Failure,3,19 May 2012,"Oh were do I begin? I was really looking forward to this - especially after reading all these ""glowing reviews"". How could this have done so badly at the movies? Very strange...OK let's start with the good points: the CGI was very good and... sorry, that was it: there was one good point. The story follows a US civil war soldier (John Carter) who is transported to Mars courtesy of a magic amulet, and inadvertently caught-up in a global war between two nations that are at a tipping point in their millennium-long fight. Some comparisons might be drawn with Cowboys and Aliens and Prince of Persia. However, don't expect the same quality of script or acting (yes, I did say that!). I was certainly not aiming for anything intellectually challenging here - just an afternoon of family entertainment! The story was slow and meandering (lots of wandering around in the desert), the script poor and short of anything other than stilted dialog and fairly superficial humour. The acting was one (not even two) dimensional. To be fair Willem Dafoe (as Tars Tarkas) and Mark Strong (as Matai Shang) put in the best performances but sadly these were not enough to save the day in a forest of consistently wooden contributions.Unfortunately Disney again delivers the same formulaic free-world menu, and a rather annoying drawl in the form of Captain Carter, this time on Mars. Very disappointing 3 out of 10.",John Carter
484,forceuserjames,Great for an evening film.,7,28 June 2012,"I understand that this film is based off of a book, but I haven't read that book so I can't vouch for the storytelling of the book, but as far as movies go this one is great to watch at least once. The world of John Carter is highly enjoyable, with interesting characters and not a bad story overall. There's nothing I really dislike about this movie, other than a couple minor complaints with how quick the story jumped sometimes, and the fact that Star Wars was copied in some scenes (which isn't too much of a complaint from me, I'm a huge Star Wars geek). I don't think I would recommend buying this title, but I would Redbox it or rent it from the library to watch for one night.",John Carter
485,peter-ferjancic,As entertaining as it is cheesy,7,23 May 2013,"This is a movie that made me feel like watching Indiana Jones the first time. It's pretty on the eyes, with likable characters and supremely entertaining. If you're looking for a flat out fun fantasy movie with a new setting, this is the best i've seen.The CGI is wonderful, the plot is good enough to get you hooked (and that's average in these days), the music is wonderful and while acting could be better on some moments it's definitely more than passable. It also introduces one of the most likable comic relief characters i've seen in a long time. With a large enough fan base it would have all the potential of a major franchise.In short - it's exactly what you expect after seeing the trailer. An entertaining, all-round fun blasting action fantasy movie.",John Carter
486,die-ghost09,A good movie in the present climes,7,16 March 2012,"I was not very excited about the movie because it didn't have much to offer i felt. But once i watched it i was forced to change my opinion. the movie has a good story and good direction and camera-work. However the acting and the sound track could do with some improvement. The CGI was pretty good. The movie lacked something which cannot be defined but it lacked... It could not completely capture the audience's imagination. Granted it showed mars in a way it was never shown before. Although it is a long movie, (more than 2 hours) there were not many boring parts. Overall i would say watch the movie if you have the time. But its not worth canceling your other appointments for this one.",John Carter
487,corvuscorax-ti22,This is what a movie should be!,10,10 June 2012,"Although I have yet to read ""A Princess of Mars"", I knew going into the theater that 1) changes would have to have been made to get an almost 100-year-old sci-fi story to appeal to a modern audience, and 2) what wasn't changed would seem odd or possibly even ridiculous due to the original story being written so long ago. I'm suppose that may be where some of the negative criticism comes from, but keeping both of those points in mind, I was able to enjoy the movie for what it was. The plot seemed to ramble a bit, and this probably has to do with adapting Burroughs's original story. A few times I found myself wondering when John Carter was going to get around to saving the princess and Helium. I'm not sure I'd mind this if I watched it again. And I will watch it again! I enjoyed this movie immensely – yes, it was visually stunning and there's a lot of action, but it the storytelling and character development are also superb. Taylor Kitsch and the entire cast did a fabulous job, and everything was put together so well. I saw it in 3-D, and while the 3-D at first seemed a little like layers of cardboard cut-outs (I heard this was due to being filmed in 2-D and converted to 3-D), I got completely sucked into the story and the world of Barsoom and didn't notice. I don't think the 3-D matters. It's an excellent movie in either case, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.",John Carter
488,aquarianavenger,"Grand adventure, clumsy execution",7,12 March 2012,"I'm giving this 7 stars because I love the effort that goes into big, sweeping scifi adventure movies...ones with lots of delicious special effects. And this movie certainly fits the bill. Unfortunately, what could have been a great movie ends up being just passable entertainment. The story starts with a great premise (so great that I went home and immediately downloaded the whole ebook series), but the moment John Carter lands on Mars the characters actions start to lose credibility.First of all, the wire work when John is finding his new found strength is clumsy at best. And it seems that the filmmakers never really set clear parameters for John's powers. One scene he destroys half an army of the green, horned martians, and the next scene he is being tossed around by just one of them. It seems to me if you can destroy half of their army, you can certainly fend off just one of them.But the worst offense for me, was the awkward dialog between John and the martian princess. Stilted, with no natural flow, too much talky and not enough subtext. Let their relationship unfold naturally, we want to see them fall in love in a way that is credible. And why would he fall in love with her anyway? For someone who was half naked, she didn't even feel like she was a real woman of flesh and bones. Half-scientist, half- warrior, you'd think she would have jumped off the screen as a character, but her character seemed only half-drawn. Definitely a problem with script & direction, but the actress may be partly to blame. Not sure, haven't seen her in anything else I can remember.Having said that, I would still recommend this movie to other scifi lovers. There's enough interesting things going on in the movie, and enough other world strangeness to get your fix. I just wish the movie would have been better realized.I would definitely see a sequel, but wouldn't be too upset if one never gets the green light. Come on Disney! This is twice you've squandered two franchises with great potential. I still don't understand how the new Tron was so beautiful and so boring. I fell asleep!However, I don't think anyone would likely fall asleep in this movie.(How's that for a tagline?) ""John Carter...You'll Stay Awake!""",John Carter
489,adgloride-440-642480,Great film,10,20 May 2017,"I've read the book and seen the film. The film is different than the book it's based on. I put this down to the writers having to update the story as it is 100 years old. I can't even see why it's been so heavily criticised. It's just a shame Disney hasn't made any more because of the cost of the original film. This is one of my all time favorite films and I think in the years to come it will be a cult classic,",John Carter
490,ryan-craven-528-410093,"Romantic, thrilling and old fashioned. How science fiction should be.",6,1 April 2013,"In a wholly saddened, hearty and sentimental way, I like John Carter. Harshly dubbed as the biggest flop of 2012, Andrew Stanton's misunderstood masterpiece of old fashioned filmmaking can stand tall as the film that refused to conform to the cynical, cash-in, bound to be a hit attitude that has plagued Hollywood of late (I.e the latest Pirates of the Caribbean (mis)adventure, which may well have been called Johnny Depp: On Stranger Tides). Stanton's attempt to bring back heart over greed, charm over grit, is as timely as it is unmarketable. This is where the blame lies. Disney's failure to capture the true intent of Carter may well have been the main reason it failed so miserably at the box office. It all began with the title. Originally, the latest Disney blockbuster was to be called John Carter Of Mars, in the correct belief that this will present it as an adaptation of the book 'John Carter Of Mars'. However, fearing that this would be too unfashionable, that it would confuse the kids that Disney so obviously aim to appeal to, therefore alienating its target audience. And so, the Of Mars was trimmed, and what once was an honest and faithful adaptation of the much loved pulp sci-fi hit serial, became a fish out of water comedy spin off of E.R, in which Dr. John Carter, recast as Taylor Kitsch, finds himself in a new country with new lessons to learn.Further examples of Disney mismanagement and lack of belief can be found in the uninspiring, and key word, FORGETTABLE posters for John Carter. Instead of going for a classic, TRADITIONAL poster for a science fiction movie (such as Star Wars' iconic one sheets), Disney opted instead to go for the exact opposite: a MODERN, DULL monstrosity that is completely at odds with everything in the movie. This is not mentioning the trailers, which further aim to extract any positivity about the movie, and spell out to the public 'Oh no, not another Avatar, CGI-crammed bore-fest'. Now on to the film itself.Whilst at times in Stanton's film, you get the feeling that the studio has tinkered with the script and what should be in it (the bizarre plot contrivance that Edgar Rice Burroughs actually saw Carter), for the most part John Carter is amiably charming, pulpy and thrilling. The opening 20 minutes are possibly the most impressive of the whole thing, introducing the main character in an original and witty way; plus the added awesomeness of Breaking Bad stalwart Bryan Cranston! Upon landing on Mars, Stanton and his scriptwriters show off their Pixar-esque talent for visual gags, with a brilliant montage showing Carter learning to manage his new found, gravitational abilities. Touches of humour like this sprinkle Carter like gold dust, such as the running gag of the aliens calling our all American friend 'VOR-GIN-YA! The tough sell of charm, action seriousness and comedy is made all the more swallow-able by the game, charismatic presence of Taylor Kitsch, lending the film real heart and heft.Elsewhere in the cast, Mark Strong continues his now grating run of bad-guy roles, with a serviceable, if ever so slightly familiar turn. Much more fulfilling, however, is Willem Dafoe, giving his green beast Thark a knowing charm but formidable power. This is not, however, where the film impresses most. The real feat of John Carter is its melding of touching, old- fashioned romance and epic and thrilling science fiction sensibilities. The chemistry between Kitsch and Lynn Collins (in a fantastic turn making her princess the most bad ass female character since Ripley) is palpable, whilst Stanton shows his skill for character development with their charming and perfectly judged romance. The action, mostly the battle sequences, are epic and thrilling, with a massacre of scary, hairy monster things by Carter the most emotionally resonant and thrilling in equal measure (inevitably, though, it is the final battle that takes the biscuit). Despite this, there are moments where creaky dialogue/alien mumbo jumbo and exposition combine to curse scenes to almost laughable depths, where Stanton's determination to stick faithfully to the source material reveals it's weakness. Furthermore, whilst it is all done with heart, humour and real emotion, at times the film feels bloated, much like Ciaran Hinds' robust chest, where Stanton could have been more brutal with his cutting of scenes. To is obvious that what makes John Carter so hard to be a hit is the sheer amount of love that went into making it, so much so that in the fact, to the uninitiated and rather young, it baffles and alienates them. However, when all is said and done, John Carter will go down in history as the best flop ever made.Verdict: Bloated, yes, and at times cringey, Andrew Stanton's wonderfully old fashioned love letter to Edgar Rice Burroughs and science fiction combines romance, action and humour to winning effect.",John Carter
491,csarneson,George Lucas should sue,5,10 April 2013,"It is absolutely amazing how somebody could rip off so many sci-fi movies while spending so much money to produce this. The director has clearly not had a truly creative thought in years. This movie is simply a mash-up of star wars scenes while having the feel and cheesiness of Flash Gordon. I just wish it was as fun as Flash Gordon was. At least that movie owned its tongue-in-cheek approach.Also, the people who gave this a 10 are either brain dead or paid to post those reviews. Nobody with a IQ over 72 would not see all of the giant flaws in this movie. Overall, I have seen worse movies and there were some things to like but it was a big disappointment. My suggestion is to not ever pay to see this movie. If it was on a free-HBO weekend then there are worse ways to kill 2 hours.",John Carter

494,JediKnightNi,Good movie that got a bad wrap,8,2 August 2012,"It's a shame that we do not view movies on a non summer blockbuster scale anymore. In the 80's there were movies that came out that were smaller movies not on the large pop culture radar. Most of the time we watched them on VHS at home. As we got older and they were repeated on Showtime, HBO, and other channels and we watched them a dozen or so times they became classics. To name a few: Clash of the Titans, Terminator 1, Conan. These movies became beloved classics, but they were not money making monsters first week out of the gate at the box office. I say John Carter is one of those movies. It is not at the level of Clash, Terminator, or Conan, at least not yet. But after a few viewings with the family at the holidays and a viewing with the older kids the idea of this film will come into perspective. It's well made, Andrew Stanton came through. Story is solid, good ideals about war and its impact not usually presented in films. Visuals are fun and new, and lots of action. With movies it is important for avid movie fans to avoid the real war of film companies trying to sabotage each other with bad press. I believe John Carter was a victim of this tactic. It's a good film that is lots of fun and movie fans should enjoy it for what it is worth and not expect it to be a Jurassic Park event. We can have smaller adventure movies like Sinbad again.",John Carter

Disney didn't disappoint! The plot was amazingly original! Had some great actors & some really amazing fresh faces. I felt that some of the things that would've been overlooked in a Disney kind of fantasy film were definitely addressed.
This story can make you laugh, cry and ponder the ""what/if's."" And what is a movie if not an escape from reality?!
I think this film was seriously underrated & I wasn't even aware of it until I saw it completely by accident. I'd say this movie is more for adults-but totally suitable for children & families. It has a little bit of everything for everyone! John Carter from Earth w his Cave of Gold is a loveable character who we can all agree w had a terrible fate after serving his country. The life that he fell into and subsequent adventure is enough to blow the oldest of minds! If your not a cynic & aren't going to pick apart every single aspect of a fantasy movie, you'll very much enjoy John Carter-perhaps even buying it & it turning into one of your creature comforts!

All this film brings you is over the top effects,costumes that are to fancy a world that is dull and makes no sense a story which copies every other and feels bland and soulless,and a main lead on who you just don't care about. Unlike avatar which gave somewhat the same feel it was the story and history of the world and the people which really drove the film, john carters main drive was special effects which as we all know except Hollywood is that special computer effects does not equal great film.BOTTOM LINE:Family fun thats to big for its own boots don't expect an avatar type movie don't watch this in 3D its crap and you wont even notice it. kids will enjoy it as they are stupid adults should hate it as they should know better in fact, wait till its on DVD there's nothing to miss at the cinema.",John Carter

We also took in the Iron Lady and The Artist and enjoyed it more than both of them put together. I know a flop when I see one and it's a shame that John Carter is tanking at the box office. Believe me it's not the best film I have seen but it did keep my attention and the characters were interesting enough to care about. What more do people want out of a film these days is beyond me, but then again we are talking about some people who have the attention span of a gnat brought on by the convenience of being able to ""click"" to the next available piece of entertainment at any sign of boredom. We had at least seven people walk out of The Artist within the first 15 minuets because they couldn't take that it was silent, and it won Best Picture. Granted John Carter has a few slow parts but none that made me want to get up and visit the concession stand. Such a shame too because I would like to see the story continue where it left off. This will be one to put into my Blu-ray collection when available and that's saying something.

Now, you wouldn't know this from the trailers, a guy with no shirt on jumping higher than humanly possible with strange aliens doesn't exactly make you want to head to the movies. At first, I didn't want to go either, however I remembered that this was the story Avatar was based on, Star Wars drew heavily from this inspired piece. As well they should, John Carter was one of those movies that drew you in within the first few minutes an didn't let go.

I made the mistake of judging a movie on the theatrical trailers and boy was I disappointed.I went to the IMAX theatre on the second week of John Carter's showing and was horrified by the fact that Disney would even consider investing into such titanic disaster of a movie. Though it will not flop as bad as Water World, I would say that it pretty close and will set Disney back a chunk of change.I have loved all of Andrew Stanton's Pixar films and was sceptical when he took on this project to make a sci-fi/fantasy film. Wall-E was a much bigger success than this show. Sadly I think Andrew should stick to cartoon films and leave the sci-fi to Lucas, Cameron, Spielberg, and other producers who have made their mark in this industry.I would not recommend this movie to any moderate to hard core fan of sci-fi movies. Many of the people who were in the theatre at the time when I was there were not impressed and were complaining on the way out about how long the show was and complaining about the storyline - how it jumped all over the place. This movie is a Disney film so it is intended to focus on family and younger children and it sticks to that area - but doesn't capture the same fascination as some of Disney's more successful shows.",John Carter

Watching the same adaptation come to life in a live action flick with amazing fx from the people at Disney, was priceless! Book lovers will not be let down as the movie has kept the essence and it's a trilogy. So, rest assured, every character is going to develop further and we're gonna be awed more and more. All those reviewers who are looking for a movie that is slow, full of drama, emotions overflowing from all the characters, long and slow camera panning, midnight in Paris or the descendants, just go and watch just that same. This movie is meant for the other 98% of the world who enjoy movie with good action, adventure and magical moments. Maybe not Oscar worthy, but I don't go by the Academy's standards. Their standards are useless if The Dark Knight and Inception and Cloverfield and many movies like them were overlooked. And how about 'The Beaver'? Anyway, in conclusion, John Carter is a must watch and in a good theater. Watch it in 3D, its spectacular. You'll love it. I rate it a point or two higher because it deserves more.",John Carter
504,kidmetal-matheny,Almost identical like the books!!! ( SPOILER FREE),10,8 April 2012,"Very rarely will you find a book based movie series ( Twilight, Hunger game, ETC) that is almost exactly like the books. John Carter is an Confederate Civil war veteran and gets transported to mars after he is attacked by something in a cave and wakes up on Mars and from then on he meets the Tharks and his dog-creature that is disgusting as it is adorable and always sticks by his side. From then on he fights many different aliens, humans in search to get back to earth only to find that he doesn't want to go back. Instead he wants to stay with the Princess of Helium and mars. Saving the end so people can go see for themselves.Overall John Carter is a magnificent movie that is one of the only movies that sicks as close to the book that I have seen in a while.I would highly recommend for families to go and see this movie in 3-D because it is excellent and doesn't deserve the hate that it has garnered. 9/10 go and see it NOW!!!!",John Carter

I went in with the idea that it would be a bad movie, lame effects and just a waste of a Saturday afternoon. Why did I go you ask? Because I loved the John Carter books since I was a child picking them up at garage sales. You've read enough reviews from people to know the story. John Carter, a Civil War veteran, is in search of gold in the Arizona territory and transported to Mars to becomes deeply involved in another civil war between two Martian races. There are some twists, some turns, some obvious plot holes and some serious corniness throughout the movie.With all this in mind, did I like the movie? Heck yeah I did! I saw the 3D version and glad I did. The CG and special effects were phenomenal. When you can watch a 3D movie, and get immersed into the world (such as Avatar,) you quickly forget the sometimes lame dialog and just watch and enjoy.The movie is entertaining. There is never a point that you are checking your iPhone under seat level or looking for that last kernel of popcorn in your bag. The on location shots were beautiful and if the only think you know about John Carter is that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote it, you will be surprised at a couple of twists in the story. Don't pay attention to the critics' destruction of this movie, just go see it with an open mind and I guarantee you will be pleasantly entertained.Another plus - new previews for The Avengers and MIB 3 - in 3D!",John Carter

I trust my obsessions, always, but at some point I got to feeling a bit exhausted and just wanted to know if I was right or maybe a total loon.I've now been to two advance screenings of JOHN CARTER.And? Holy Living Thark! The bar on science fiction and fantasy movies has Officially Been Raised.JOHN CARTER is based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' A Princess of Mars --a novel first published a century ago. I expected to come out of the movie with my head full of comparisons to all the things Burroughs' imagination inspired: STAR WARS, AVATAR, FLASH GORDON, etc. Understandably so, as I'm much more familiar with all of them. That didn't happen. Put simply, if STAR WARS is a kids' science fiction movie franchise that adults enjoy (and it is), then JOHN CARTER is an adult science fiction movie that kids will enjoy.CARTER is such an immersing experience. Every moment reveals something new about Mars; about the exotic alien races and cultures that call it home, or about their individual characters. James Cameron's AVATAR showed us a world we've never seen before and it was wondrous to behold, but Andrew Stanton's JOHN CARTER is a movie so rich with detail that it left me feeling like I had been somewhere. JOHN CARTER feels like nothing so much than as if David Lean had made a science fiction epic of love and war set on Mars.This movie has a confidence to it you won't be expecting. It's unafraid to linger over the characters, and give them time to breathe and reveal themselves. My favorite decade for movies is the 1960s, and JOHN CARTER has some of the epic adventure movies of that time running through it like a seam of gold. There's a bit of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA in there as I alluded to before, and perhaps a touch of ZULU and SPARTACUS is mixed in with the Martian airships and predator cities. Old fashioned storytelling magic and 21st century movie sorcery have combined into a film that's a pulp sci-fi masterpiece.To the ERB faithful: please relax. Yes, there are changes from the novel; no, they are not the arbitrary changes made in inferior movie adaptations where the filmmaker just wants to do his/her own ideas. Every change is made to tell Burroughs' story or reveal some aspect of Burroughs' characters in a way more befitting a movie instead of a novel.Going into this, I had absurdly high expectations. A friend of mine told me he was worried the movie wouldn't live up to them and that frankly I was starting to sound a little crazy. Well, the movie went and exceeded my expectations. I love it, and give it a 10/10. I'm definitely going to see it at least six times in the theater, and will finally buy a Blu-Ray player just to watch it at home.I realize this review sounds over the top. That's just how excited I am about the movie. Perhaps in a previous life I was an ancient Greek by the name of Hyperboles? Anyway, see the movie. I guarantee that even if you don't like it as much as I did, you'll see where I was coming from with this gushing review.",John Carter
508,jhs3-134-201076,Could have been a fantastic movie,8,8 June 2012,"8 out of 10. I enjoyed the movie. But, unlike a couple of the other reviews I read, I DID read the books. I got them when I was 11, and read them over and over.And I tear my hair out! WHY Why why did someone feel a need to rewrite the story? There is so much here that is 'correct'. The green men are great. Calots and thoats a little overdone, but good. Why combine the white apes and the apts of the polar regions? Why are the Therns the bad guys - they should have been saved for the second film. Powell was Carter's partner. What did it add to the story to make him a cavalry captain trying to recruit Carter? It makes no sense.The public and critics have panned the movie, undeservedly. It is not a bad story. I am extremely disappointed that the producers, directors and writers did not use the story that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote. With the technology available, they could have created a masterpiece.",John Carter
509,Kermit_stoned,"John Carter, the truth behind the movie.",1,20 July 2012,"Hello Dear Reader, Let me first address me voting a solid 1, it's not truly a 1 I would give it a solid 4,5, but due to it having a really messed up rating 6,7 I'll keep my vote up.Lets proceed to the movie, the movie is made over the content of a book which was very much ahead of it's time, and is in fact a good book, but stick to the book, cause the movie is bad.The movie feels overly paced, you get pushed through things like the makers was thinking ""oh we need to have this too, put it in, and shorten the dialog"", you don't get bonded to any of the characters partly due to bad acting, but mainly because of a really bad script.You get told we are on Mars, which means the main character can jump really high, but it also gives him grotesque strenght, which means he can one hit things, combat several thousand things charging him, and jump a solid 40 km, even in sci-fi this borders on raping physics.Then we get parts of a language they presumably speak on Mars, but these are only fragmented words which means you end up thinking ""why even put it in?"", it doesn't add anything to the story, it just makes you wonder why, because other movies has done this far far better.An the heroine of the movie, now she is supposedly a Marsian archaeologist or some stuff, and they set out to find a relic place which hasn't been found in thousand of years, approximately 2 minutes after this is told, they just luck upon the building... I mean talk about bad pacing? And inside this relic story stuff, suddenly everything flashes blue, and John Carter of EAAARTH, needs to wear his heart as an armor? When they enter this, concentrate really closely on the lines, and the acting, it's so cliché that we ended up laughing during the movie.All in all, if you want a movie that is unwittingly VERY funny because of bad acting, and sticky bad writing, then watch it... then it's quite fun, if you want an epic story of intergalactic war, then watch the old Star Wars trilogy again./Simon",John Carter
510,teslabrooke,good family movie,5,5 August 2012,"John Carter reminded me a lot of the movie Avatar. When it first started I thought it was going to be really dull. From the start you get that western feel to it. You get that John has a past as he is reckless and doesn't care about anything but himself after his family dies. The story is pretty boring until John finally gets to Mars and that's when the movie started to get better. Some parts of the movie you sit and feel like it's going on and on but then it picks up and something else happens. One of my favorite parts was when he first gets there and can jump hundreds of feet in the air and saves the princess. Also, is when he first encounters the monster dog creature. Who he thinks is going to kill him but actually sticks to his side through out the entire movie. Overall decent movie (:",John Carter
511,keltz53,Patchwork of Mars,8,22 March 2012,"After having read the first four novels in Burroughs' classic series, I truly wanted to love Disney's John Carter! However, familiarity with the plot lines & major players only served to confuse the viewer here, as there was such a mishmash of Burroughs' characters, interactions, & settings that I actually wished they'd layered a narrative over the entire mess. Horrors! What is up with Hollywood's insistence on tossing snippets of an author's works into a blender with 'new material', effectively ripping the original plot to shreds? As soon as I saw wedding rings on Captain Carter's left hand, I knew we were in for a rough ride. Did I wake up on a different planet like our hero? Or was it revealed that he had been married (& a father) in later books? If not, how gratuitous of Stanton & his fellow screenwriters to drop in flashbacks of a family who shouldn't exist at all - only to kill them off! Kitch, Collins, a strong supporting cast, & even the impressive CGI are merely wasted on such a weak script. There is so much more material in Burrough's books that this could have been the first of an intriguing film series. Unfortunately, this poor Frankenstein was dead before it made it to the village.",John Carter
512,Wbcgs,Good film,9,5 May 2014,"A fine film which I have thoroughly enjoyed at least a half dozen times. I also enjoyed all of the books some 60 years ago. I suppose I shall order the DVD now. I do wish the lead actor had a more recognizable name. The graphics were very well done indeed. The voices fit the actors as we'll. at the risk sounding rather sophomoric, I must also state that Woola was among my favorite characters. Most enjoyable! Thank you. This phrasing looks as wooden as it must sound, due no doubt to the requirement for at least ten lines. Law of the Medes and Persians, no doubt. But if that is the price I must pay in order to comment, then so be it.",John Carter
513,caseyx,A Really enjoyable movie,9,15 March 2012,"I went to see John Carter with my boys (9 and 12) and they loved it as did I. A cool story spread out over time and space from the old west to Mars. The story was pretty good with some surprising twists. There could've been some improvements in the casting of John Carter but overall good stuff! The special effect and creatures were really cool and there was plenty of action.The creatures in John Carter were also well thought out and often very funny. All in all a great ride and certainly worth seeing more than once.John Carter deserves to become a success, it certainly stands out!",John Carter
514,g-young77,Witless,4,12 June 2012,"Shakespeare once said ""Brevity is the soul of wit"". If true, Disney's ""John Carter"" could be described as witless.That isn't to say ""John Carter"" didn't have some fun moments or decent effects, but director Andrew Stanton used his $250 million budget and 2-hour-plus run-time to turn a simple 150-page book into a jumbled Rubik's Cube of plots, sub-plots, sub-sub-plots, obscure motives, ulterior motives, and evolving motives - then asked the audience to make sense of it all.So much time was spent making things complicated that when it came time for the story to move forward there often wasn't time to unravel the tangled mess logically - so simplistic gimmicks were used. If the plot required a selfish character to be selfless, he'd have a quick epiphany and do the right thing. If an entire society needed to help their sworn enemies, a quick speech could sway them. Need to learn the Martian language? No problem, just drink a glass of Martian water.Perhaps some day Hollywood will remember that all the visual/special effects in the world can't fill a plot hole.",John Carter

The idea of this movie is quite good, but I must say that the acting of both hero and princess was sometimes quite bad, and that many elements of the plot (for example getting married and kill the bride) made very little to no sense at all.

The people who give this movie a low rating must not be sci-fi lovers, I guess. Or people are mislead by the title, which indeed sounds a bit dull.

It simply looked like a good action movie and I wanted to see it.Little did I know what a breathtaking, entertaining, and wondrous epic movie this was going to be. Think of Star Wars with Avatar. I actually enjoyed it better than Avatar since it didn't contain all that political preaching. This simply is a great action sci-fi movie that should become a new classic.Disney did an outstanding job with this movie since the plot, special effects, and action scenes were outstanding.Basic plot: John Carter is somehow transported to Mars and acquires super human powers due to Mars' gravity (i.e. like Superman). While there, he gets caught up in a war between the Martians (who in turn are being manipulated by beings that act and resemble the ancient Greek gods). Along the way, our hero falls in love with a Martian princess who, in turn, is trying to save her people.In short, if you really enjoy sci-fi movies, then don't miss this one.I really hope there's a sequel!",John Carter
524,mail-3247,"Why Andrew, why???",3,8 March 2012,"I saw director and writer Andrew Stanton at a lecture ""How to Tell Stories"" he gave in Moscow two days ago (the movie has opened in Russia yesterday and I just happened to be in town for the premiere). I admire Andrew for everything he did for Pixar and every word he said at the lecture felt right... But then I went to see the movie.You guessed right, this is not going to be a positive review. But I wanted it so badly to be! One of my favorite directors, making a movie based on a book I tremendously enjoyed as a kid, with a decent budget for special effects. But the movie sucked. Incoherent predictable clichéd melodrama with stale dialogue, pile up of flashbacks and boring - yes, BORING - action. I could not believe I am watching the work of creator of ""Bugs Life"", ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Wall-E""! And this is not a rant of a book fan, I don't even remember the book. And not complaint of betrayed high expectations, I didn't have much, based on poster and trailers. But what the heck happened to good storytelling? Why am I watching bunch of people I don't care about and didn't have time to find out about talking about some political intrigues inside of insanely unrealistic CGI sets. Why am I getting my own deja vu flashbacks from ""Avatar"", ""Star Wars"", ""Cowboys and Aliens"" and ""Star Track"" (and not in the good sense). How can a girl dressed in princess- Leia type costume be SO unsexy? How can be guy, leaping over mountains and crushing hundreds of enemies be SO unexciting?

525,silalus,Unashamedly Fun,9,6 March 2012,"When you hear that a film cost a quarter of a billion dollars to make, you probably tend to form some expectations. When that movie is directed and co-written by Pixar's mighty Oscar machine Andrew Stanton (WALLE, Finding Nemo), those expectations ought to grow. And when that movie is based on the story that inspired many of cinema's greatest sci-fi epics, well... your expectations probably begin to pile up very, very high.And you know what? Leave 'em all at home.John Carter is not at all the movie that you would expect based on all of that- and believe it or not, that's a good thing. Instead of trying to be what you expect it to be, John Carter is boldly unashamed to be exactly what it is: an over-the-top romp across Mars, a sweaty, non-stop slugfest, and a ton of pure, unpretentious fun.In a sci-fi cinemascape where we've come to expect every protagonist to be a poignantly flawed anti-hero and every villain to be a Campbellian self-justified hero of their own story, this film is genuinely refreshing in its lack of depth. The title character has just enough back-story to let us sympathize with him while the forces he fights against are wonderfully, one-dimensionally evil. High-tech airships and teleportation devices coexist with civil-war era rifles and swords without a hint of explanation. The romantic lead is an honest to goodness damsel in distress. It sounds like a recipe for a truly, even epically lousy movie. And yet...It works. And it works very, very well. The lack of depth takes nothing away from the film and instead it simply doesn't distract us. As best as I can describe it, watching John Carter is like being served a perfectly cooked steak without any stuff on top. Sure blue cheese crumbles, mushrooms, and those sorts of things are great- but a really good steak doesn't need them.And what a steak it is! Every second of time saved by cutting out the fluff is spent on brutal combat and spectacular flight sequences, seasoned with occasional but perfectly timed moments of comedy. Underlying it all is an excellent score by another Pixar great, Michael Giacchino (who among other achievements won an Oscar with Up) and truly bone-shaking audio effects. There is too much technical excellence here for one review to list, and it comes together to bring you on one fantastic ride.I was honestly surprised, but it all makes sense when you think about it. The Edgar Rice Burroughs novels were pulp science fantasy- very nearly westerns or even romances set in space. They were wonderfully imaginative and vivid but they were also never intended to be great studies of the human condition. Instead they were easy to read, exciting, and really, really fun! That is, after all, how they captured the imagination and inspired so many of the young men and women who discovered them.By that measure, John Carter is a wonderful tribute to its source material- and quite apart from that it's a great film that is well worth watching for some pure, lighthearted fun.",John Carter
526,aryaguna,I didn't expect it to be this good,9,18 March 2012,"First of all, I'm very disappointed with the critics or news-makers that said this is a bad movie, that Disney made a wrong move to green-lit this movie that flop in the States. They almost made me did not go to the cinema to watch this and obviously they didn't watch the movie and just report something based on someone else's opinion.I am truly satisfied to watch this movie and It's been awhile since I felt this way after watching something in a cinema. I'm truly glad that I follow my instinct that this movie was very good. The special effects were good and enough to make to story moves forward.This is a kind of Sci-Fi movie that was not scared to establish and flesh out the characters in it without being boring. It's making me understood the characters way of thinking and the reason they did what they did in the movie. Although the story comes from a source that preceded Star Wars, Dune, Avatar and every other Sci-Fi movies but this doesn't feel old. It feels significant and like a totally new world that I can enjoy.John Carter's adventure while he was still on Earth and transported to Mars and back again makes my want to see more of his adventure and the continuation of this story. So please Disney, I plead you to make a sequel of this movie. Don't give up on this gem!!

But I've been waiting 46 years for this movie to be made. 46 years ago I read the book this movie was based on. I went on to read all the books in the Edgar Rice Burroughs Martian series and have read them all several times since.The book the movie was based on was written in 1912. So for 100 years generation after generation has enjoyed Mr. Burroughs' works. The movie makers changed so much about this story it makes me think all those changes contributed to the movie's failure at the box office.The original book was short by today's standards. It could have easily been made into a movie without changing a thing. Apparently the Hollywood moguls felt they had to improve on a formula that's been successful for 100 years. Arrogant for them.

No time machine , no hidden gate, just a simple chain with a pendant helped him to do so. Most astonishing thing is, He loved mars more than earth and wanted to stay there forever even after death. One thing they showed pretty good is that people in Mars are red and have different colour blood. John carter's acting was not too attractive. but his girl friend was hot. The story is not strong enough to drive a huge amount of audience. In the beginning, it was pretty confusing what actually is going on , but after 15 minutes things start changing and interesting. This movie probably shoot in 2D and later converted in 3D. I watched in IMAX 3D but still dint see much 3D effects. Graphics was good. They designed the long tooth aliens pretty well.

They fear it.So don't listen to whoever goes around telling that the movie flopped, bombed, it's a failure and so on. These people want YOU listening to them to turn it into a failure if YOU follow their wishes and obey to not watch it and judge it with your own eyes and brain.Just go and watch the movie.

Truth be told, the underlying concept has been beaten to atoms.Talking creatures, worm holes, anti gravity ships and the entire paraphernalia of odds and ends that are expected of a sci-fi flick have been used in the movie barring the story. In the good old twentieth century we were subjected to challenges via the storyline and script. Imagination and story telling have become inversely proportional to the speed of computers. CG has become sugar cotton candy. Looks big from the outside but soon melts away into nothing.Please Hollywood take note ""Don't Make 3D movies"". Had this movie been in the regular format I would have added at-least another 3 stars but alas it was not to be so. It felt so much better to see the movie removing the 3D glasses from time to time. Well, I had to do something sitting in the seat for 2 hours waiting for the movie to end. 3D is totally destroying the movie going experience.

But every time the characters open their mouth, it's disappointment after disappointment.The disparity in culture between the two civilizations is portrayed so badly. Some times, it seems as if both have the same culture, but other times they're making some lame attempt to show that they're different.( Eg: ""shaking"" hands with the princess, meeting the green people for first time ).When John first hits Mars, he's flabbergasted and scared. Then he immediately gets cocky with the green people. The character development doesn't flow at all.The love story between the princess and John is so corny and annoying. When they play the John's flashbacks to his dead wife, you can sense the desperation in trying to add some character to the hero. It seems like John is desperate to get his hands on her every freaking time he has a chance. Doesn't fit his character at all.So much is unexplained. There are so many loose strings. The ""immortal beings"" just come across as douches who are douches because they can. Their motive was explained so blandly. If the guy with the blue thing had so much power, why set up some marriage so they can ambush Helium? It's all so ridiculous.Some people said the effects are good. No way. It's good for 5 years ago maybe. Not today.Don't even get me started on the acting. All of them had the freaking same couple of expressions the whole two hours. It could have been worse though. Gladly, the poor plot execution kept me distracted.This movie could have been so much. It had a great setting, three civilizations, one group of God people, and a superhuman by Mars standards. The overall architecture of the story is decent too. But execution failed hard.PS, I haven't read the book, nor do I know how accurate this story is compared to it.",John Carter
535,x-seth-h,A real Disney epic!,10,25 March 2012,"I have not read the books about John Carter, but I want to read them now. I went to John Carter with the expectations that you see on the average review - 1 part Star Wars, 1 part Avatar, 1 part seen-it-all- before. I love Star Wars, so that sounded good enough to me.John Carter is in the same genre as Star Wars, has the same scale and beauty as Avatar, but is wholly its own movie.The story, the sciency bits, and the characters are quite unique. Yes, the hero has an alien that follows him around, but this one is not irritating. Yes, there is a scantily-clad strong-willed princess, but this one is a scientist. Yes, there are flying ships, but these are powered by focused light and are very mechanical-steampunk. Yes, there is a native people that adopts the hero, but these natives don't all look exactly the same, and know what guns are. ADHD viewers will say that John Carter drags in the middle, which it does, but it drags much less than say StarWars, Avatar, Lord of the Rings, etc.There was never a spot in the movie where I thought ""I have seen this same thing before, this is a rip-off"".The movie-making itself was very good. The pacing was good, the acting was good for this kind of movie (scifi is famous for mediocre acting). The CGI was creative and unobtrusive while the telling of the story was clear and moving.I had to see it in 3D as that was the only format in my town, and surprisingly I did not get dizzy or a headache. Those of you who like 3D will find it does put you into the film more, but this movie would be just as grand and engaging without it.This movie was not perfect, and not my new favorite. Any minor complaints about this or that character or scene are just that, minor. It is an underrated gem, and deserves more attention, so my rating is a notch higher than I would normally do.",John Carter
536,trevorruth,You are ugly... but you are beautiful,5,18 April 2012,"I'm just going to start off by saying; My expectations for this film were as low as can be. After seeing the trailer and hearing all the reviews, I quickly decided that John Carter was going to awkwardly flop onto its face like a penguin with a broken foot. And... I was completely right. So, why did I go to see this film if I knew that it would suck? Because I'm a huge fan of Burrough's work, and to be honest... I wanted to know how Disney pulled off one of the most iconic pulp sci-fi novellas ever written. Well, as far as visual style is concerned, the film did a great job portraying the ludicrous pulpiness of the source material; The design for the aliens, the surreal alien architecture, and Victorian western scenery in the opening is just awesome, and it does a great job grabbing your attention. I also liked the science-based elements that they implemented in terms of Mars' gravity and the inhabitants' understanding of the other planets. This added a realism to the film that contrasted with the testosterone- laced ridiculousness of the fight sequences which were, in all honesty, quite unmemorable, despite the gore that somehow made its way into a Disney film. With that said, the constant CGI is incredibly ugly to look at, and the dialogue was unconvincing, given the era that the plot had taken place. Even so, Willem Dafoe did his a great job as Tars Tarkas, and Lynn Collins is always a pleasure to look at on screen. For a $250 million budget, I expected a bit more from this film in terms of design and authenticity, and to have the main bulk of the film all CGI was just a disappointment. Nevertheless, I did find some pleasure in watching this movie. I'd say if you're a fan of any of Burrough's work, check it out, but if you're looking for a movie that'll blow your mind... give this one a pass.",John Carter
537,corneliusdion,"John Carter, huge potentials had been wasted",6,25 March 2012,"The movie actually had a lot potentials, but unfortunately, Andrew (Stanton) had wasted it. The movie itself actually gripping, and quite a 3D experience, but it dragged on, and on, and on. The story looked strong at the beginning, but weaker in the middle. Unlike Pandora in Avatar, Mars (or Barsoom) looked like a boring planet, with endless red stones and desert (sorry, Tars Tarkas!). The only thing that saved this movie is Dejah Thoris and the amazing ship design that the characters used in the movie, Woola seem failed to be the cute creature in Disney traditions. Well directed, but Andrew (Wall-E --> John Carter) should learn more to direct live-action movies just like Brad (The Incredibles --> Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol).",John Carter
538,negamario98,pretty good,6,12 March 2012,"john carter is a another Disney movie, as you can see, prince of Persia the sands of time was a big mess, and was just awful. luckily they got a pretty good directer, the one who did movies like finding nemo and wall-e, and wow, john carter was definitely not a disappointment! it is basically about a civil war vet who gets transported to mars by a mysterious medallion, and ends up meeting two tribes, one that looks like aliens, and one that basically look human(although they aren't) overall this movie had a few flaws(why the heck does he get chained up a lot?) and the story may feel weak to some, but otherwise this an enjoyable movie.",John Carter
539,flickchick1909,Mars never looked so good...,10,2 March 2012,"I have so much to say about this movie but I guess I should start with what or who is John Carter.John Carter (Kitsch) is an American Civil War soldier who is transported to Mars. He first encounters the green skinned warlike nomads known as the Tharks and, due to his superhuman powers (Mars gravity and all that), quickly becomes embroiled in not only the political issues of the Tharks, but those of the red skinned, humanoid Martians as well. The humanoids control Mars through a series of city states with Zodanga annihilating everything in it's path. Helium is the last free state. Helium also has a beautiful and feisty Princess (Collins) and a political marriage to save all has been arranged. Then she meets our handsome hero.yep you guessed it. The two fall in love and are now fighting for not just what they love and believe in but who they love and believe in.This movie is based on the book Princess of Mars, the first in a series of 11 novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs 100 years ago. They are also known as The Barsoom or John Carter of Mars series. A lot of what you have seen in these types of movies up until now has drawn, in some way, on this series of novels. Star Wars, Avatar, Babylon 5, Flash Gordon and even some Indiana Jones. I am sure the list is endless but Sci Fi is not my genre. When you watch John Carter, you will be able to pick the similarities immediately.If you are aware of this movie's existence, then you are probably aware of the negative attention it has garnered. I saw this movie over 2 weeks ago and have had to watch as people all over the internet trash it. They have laughed at Disney for spending $250 million on an obvious dud. They have said Disney has distanced itself from the movie before it's release. They have criticised everything from the trailers to the posters to the casting of 2 unknowns as the leads. Oh and they have done all this without having seen the movie! These people are best ignored and sent back to their mother's basements!! Now, I will say that Disney has done itself NO favours whatsoever with the posters and trailers for John Carter. This I will concede. But I have found the best trailer on You Tube and it was made by serious fans of the books thejohncarterfiles.Please, if you are going to watch a trailer for this movie, make it this one. It just gives you a much better idea of what the movie looks like.So what did I think? I LOVED it. I really, truly did. I wanted to see it because I had read so much about it over the last few years. Sci Fi may not be my thing but that doesn't mean I don't know what's going on in the land of movie making.This movie has all the blockbuster action we have come to expect from this genre. The CGI is spectacular. The Martian characters are fantastic. The stand out Martian is without a doubt Woola, a pet that adopts John Carter and is as ugly as he is adorable. An ugly slug like animal that will melt your heart. Trust me :) There is good vs evil. There is Martian vs Martain. There is human vs human. There is serious stuff. There is fun stuff. A stand out scene I just cannot resist mentioning.When Carter does arrive on Mars, his introduction to Tars Tarkas is absolutely hilarious. The mistake with his name becomes an ongoing gag throughout the movie and to great affect. Even our hero gives up, smiles and just shakes his head. Oh and yes, there is a very easy and believable reason why they all speak English.This movie is for everyone who likes Star Wars or Avatar. It's for everyone who ever wished they could go to Mars. It's for everyone who likes a love story between a handsome hero and beautiful, spirited Princess. It's for everyone who wants to see a great movie and escape, literally, to another world for 2 hours. It's for everyone who likes a simple Sci Fi story. It's for everyone who likes a layered story they can think on a little later. It's for little kids (although at over 2 hours running length it may just be a tad too long for our littlest movie goers) and it's for big kids.Ignore the critics and go see this movie. I think you will enjoy it. I saw it in 3D and I usually think 3D is a waste of money (sorry studios) but for this movie, fork out the extra $5 and see it in 3D.Mars never looked so good.",John Carter
540,winningsteven,Wonderful Movie,9,17 March 2012,"At first, i felt reluctant to see this movie. I'm not interested with the synopsis, the movie poster made me think that is kind of Tarzan movie because the way its display the outfit of Taylor Kitsch (John Carter). But i finally decided to watch this movie after my friend Eric told me many people give this movie positive review. I'm glad I did.The way the director Andrew Stanton combine all of the pieces is genius. It is like all of the plot support each other. One thing that surprised me, i thing you must categorize this movie with one more genre, that is Comedy. Yeah, the movie was also hilariously funny but not diminish the action and the drama part of the movie.CMIIW, one mistakes i found about the movie was when John Carter first transfer to the Barsoom, he only said one word. But through the movie, we discovered that he must add 4 more words to transfer to and from Barsoom. Strange for me.Anyway, it is an entertaining movie and recommended to be watched. That's all my review and thank you for reading :)",John Carter
541,netmange,Zzzzzz,5,21 March 2012,"Of late, IMDb has been filled with rave reviews of even the biggest film flops. Just look at the reviews of John Carter and you'll see what I mean. Makes one wonder about the reliability of these reviews. John Carter is headed towards earning the ""honor"" of being the biggest and most expensive film flop in history. It took in excess of 250 mil to make. It opened to box office earnings of just over 30 mil. Why would if flop so bad if it were half as good as many of these reviews make it out to be? But the movie is not all bad. Pros: Great effects Great fight sequences Visually good but I wouldn't go so far as to call it visually stunning Nice twist to plotCons: Crap acting Cheesy lines worthy of a Mills and Boon love story Boring...... Almost fell asleep couple of times Couple of funny moments but offset by many other failed jokesIn summary, 1. I would rent this to watch on a DVD but not pay to watch it in the cinema 2. You might enjoy this much more if you were a prepubescent sci-fi geek 3. IMDb will only be useful as a site to read a synopsis of a movie but not for its reviews because it looks like even a $5 production made in the basement of a teenager will get rave 9 star reviews",John Carter
542,benderangelika,simply a good movie,10,28 March 2012,"First of all: this movie is neither a sciences fiction movie nor a fantasy - it is both. And this is finally something new that I personally enjoyed very much. Of course, it does not make 'sense', but who cares? If you actually try not to pigeonhole this movie, I am pretty sure anyone can enjoy it. The plot line was surprisingly good; the characters were also something different from what you usually see in those kinds of movies. This movie will make you gaze because of its amazing sceneries but it will also make you laugh. The dialogs were not cheesy at all but often funny and refreshing. Overall: I do not know why some people have so much negative criticism for this movie. Sometimes you should not look for the 'deeper' meaning in something and just shut up and enjoy a good movie.",John Carter
543,youreyesonly,A Fairy Tale for Boys,10,3 January 2013,"I saw this movie at an early screening for Disney employees. By the end I was sniffling in tears.So when it came out I dragged my wife to it. I was worried that I might not like it a second time, but nope, it made me cry again. But my wife was bored to tears watching it. When it was over she said I probably liked it so much because it was a fairy tale for boys.That made so much sense! Girls love their fairy tales. The handsome prince rides in and rescues the poor maiden and whisks him away to live happily ever after. But in a boy's fairy tale, an ordinary guy finds himself in a wonderful place, and he has super powers, like the ability to leap hundreds of feet in the air! And he is stronger than giant monsters! But best of all, he meets a feisty, insanely sexy and gorgeous princess, who despite the fact that's he's really nobody special, falls in love with him, and they live happily ever after! (and have lots of hot sex, presumably.)And like any great Fairy Tale, it's not rooted in reality, but taps into pure unconscious wish-fulfillment. The laws of physics on Barsoom are nonsensical, but so what? They make as much sense as a pumpkin turning into a stagecoach, or a poison apple that makes you fall asleep until you get the kiss of true love. In fact, the sheer magical impossibility of every element of science in this movie only adds to that fairy tale thing! As I watched this movie I was taken back to how I felt watching Star Wars the first time. But why on Earth would this movie need to cost over 200 million dollars? It just seems impossible that that much money was spent. It certainly doesn't seem visible on the screen. But hey, who am I to complain? I'm glad they made it just like it is!My other favorite Fairy tale for boys was Flash Gordon. Oh, man! Whenever that movie comes on television, I'm hooked! Avatar is also a fairy tale for boys, but I have to say, it left me cold. Perhaps because because so many plot elements were borrowed from Cameron's earlier movies that it just kept reminding me it was a movie. Or maybe that Avatar had a message to convey, about the evils of greed and aggression, yet it seemed to me the heroes were every bit as judgmental and ignorant as the bad guys. In John Carter, there isn't a big message like that. It's just the story of a disappointed man who refuses to choose sides, until he realizes that the hot chick is on one of those sides, and she pretty much forces him to grow a conscience, if he ever hopes to score with her. And once he's grown a conscience, he's a better man for it. I am very sad the movie flopped so monumentally at the box office, because I would dearly love to see the sequel!",John Carter
544,armanut86,this movie is not a normal movie but maybe not very interesting or!! new one in its deepest part,7,6 June 2012,this movie was not bad but if u wanna see new thing i can say you may waste your time watching this one. in the whole its a movie worth watching once!! here are the special thing about movie: 1)the main character he is cool bad 2)the girl of movie is not 3)there are new species 4)combat not really big thing 5)actores not bad ones 6)i hate one of the angels i don't have else thing and I'm in a hurry so :Apples are excellent fruits.

There were parts that I felt were slow moving and I couldn't help but feel the 'dated' science fiction theories of the film. You can tell that this idea was something created long in the past. I did like the special effects of the film. Some of the characters were put together very well while others really lacked in depth. Really though, I'm not expecting Oscar performances and character development when I see a movie like this. The movie may be slow at parts, maybe even a bit too long, but if you like action, adventure, and some twists at the end, then you'll like the movie. If you like science fiction, go see John Carter!",John Carter

This movie should of been more successful and despite what most of the critics and viewers are saying about this movie, ""that its a lot like Star Wars and Avatar"", that is not true. I have found John Carter to be an amazing movie visually, and the story was actually great. Don't get me wrong, Star Wars and Avatar were great movies, but I believe that John Carter was far much different and slightly better. I saw John Carter in the theaters the week that it came out and I had a lot of fun watching this movie!. So the hell with the critics, in my opinion, John Carter kicked ass!!!!.",John Carter

The 12-foot tall barbarians were different from the Navi's in Avatar but still i found a couple of similarities in them .There is action ,comedy ,there is emotions,there is mystery,there is there is everything in this movie....

549,brentmonahan,Well worth viewing for the sci fi/fantasy fan,9,12 March 2012,"At long last! As a reader of this series in the 1960s, I wondered when it would finally come to the screen. The visual problems have been solved spectacularly by green screens and computer physiognomy mapping. The screenplay is good but too complex for those who haven't read at least 'A Princess of Mars,' 'The Gods of Mars,' and 'Warlord of Mars.' (Also the title: John Carter is too bland and tells nothing). It seems like the Disney folk were afraid they wouldn't get a chance to film sequels, so they crammed too much into one movie. This is similar to the original filming of Frank Herbert's Dune, where everyone in the audience was handed a glossary of characters and terms! The acting and filming are fine, the sets and costumes hewing close to Burrough's descriptions and to the iconic Frazetta paintings of many years ago. Nice flow to the script and plenty of action. Like Harry Potter and the Star Wars epics, the required arena battle is there. The biggest problem is that the writers have given the Therns limitless power in shape-shifting. Taken to its logical conclusion, if this were the case, anyone on this violent world would have to give passwords to everyone near them and ask for the password every few seconds.",John Carter

551,marco-galvez,Reason of the mix reviews,6,28 May 2018,"At first i thought that the mix reviews were due to the combination of genres, being this a cowboy, scifi and fantasy movie all at once. It wasn't untill the end i realized it was due to great and terrible moments this movie has. The first half of the movie was strong, from character introductions and storytelling to even editing. Halfway through things get abrupt, Carter had a full hour and a half of potential character development, yet they push his motivation in half a minute of screen time during an action sequence edited horribly with a montage sequence of the past. I understand that writers might have wanted this to be the breaking point, but directing missed heavily. From here on things go on a decline, not so much as story wise, but more of those as pacing, editing and overall acting. 
Movie that was firm with its idea but loose on its execution.",John Carter
552,joesmaname,John Carter of Mars,9,6 May 2015,"If your hoping to see the next: Aliens, Star Wars, Star Trek or even Matrix, you may hate this movie. If you expect 'John Carter of Mars' to be based, well, on Mars... as we now all know it with Scifi thrown in, you may find it ridiculous.If however you're familiar with Edgar Rice Burroughs: ""A princess of Mars"" (written almost 100 years ago) or if your Scifi tastes lean heavily towards G-PG rated fantasy, you may appreciate this adventure for the beautifully filmed, well executed, escapist romp, that it is. I had read a few JC of Mars books as a kid and could remember the basics. I couldn't tell you what was changed in this movie and that's probably a good thing too.So long story short - If you're a fan of early 1900's Scifi/fantasy or just romantic fantasy, you'll likely enjoy this movie.

This remake however earns a very strong thumbs up from this movie ""critic"". ERB has so many books that have gone the TV or movie route, and this is one of his best series of books however, I can see why it's taken so long to make as CG and the necessary FX technology has only now become available so that true justice can be done to create a believable visual story. I loved Woola, and Tars Tarkus and Sola look just like the book covers from so long ago that I remember reading as a child. Kudos to Andrew Stanton for being true to the books. Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins have the attraction in their interactions on screen that brought the dialog to life. I loved that the bits of ironic humor that threads through ERB's work remained apparent and yet was not campy. That's Edgar Rice Burroughs, better know for ""Tarzan"" for those of you who don't know him by his initials. I hope Disney will continue to transfer his books to film, most specifically ""The Chessmen of Mars"" which is probably my favorite of the John Carter series. It's too bad someone won't take the Raymond Feist/Jenny Wurts series Servant of the Empire, Daughter of the Empire and Mistress of the Empire to film, or the late Roger Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber. Oh well, one can only hope. If you haven't seen this movie, try to catch it on SyFy channel as it's been running this month. You won't be disappointed! May 2016",John Carter
554,Jammal_Stone,This film is first and foremost worth your time and money,8,19 June 2012,"This film is first and foremost worth your time and money. It is well written, well acted and beautiful. If you've reservations about the film, please lend me two minutes of your time and read on.If you are like myself your first misgiving will be the Disney logo. Historically Disney and live-action PG-13 have not gone together. Disney is known to pull one too many punches. Luckily, this is a fate that John Carter manages to evade, even if at times the film has cliché Disney moments.While well made, John Carter is not likely to win academy awards for any individual element. Nor trying to do so. It is instead a medley of above-average to excellent. The science-fiction-fantasy hints as great depth but does not entirely explore it. The character development gracefully discusses very serious and real demons. The cinematography is not groundbreaking, yet it well executes the current state of the art. Altogether it plays out like a well written symphony in the hands of a talented orchestra. It is the opus of no individual but still altogether excellent.Beyond the film the world of John Carter is in itself spectacular. There is a depth of culture and scientific ex-machina presented that not only creates verisimilitude, it inspires the imagination. From the paradigms of family and society to the exploration of nanotechnology and adaptive material science, there is a rare depth to be enjoyed.I won't promise the film of the year but I will say this: You will not regret watching John Carter.",John Carter

One of the few movies that I can watch over and over again without getting a sick feeling in the pit of the stomach due to mediocre direction/production attempt.

People read then. This would be a good candidate to be introduced in the junior high and high school level is supplemental reading. If marketed right and the remainder the series produced and made as well as this this could be another Lord of the rings at the box office. Like Tolkien, Burroughs has his own elaborate writing style.. my father read this in the 1930s and I read it in the 1960s. Truly a masterpiece.

The actors constantly have to say the most silly made up words and you feel a little bad for them. John Carter is your generic nihilistic tough guy who doesn't care about anything but everyone cares a lot about him. His voice is the voice you did when playing with your Spawn action figures when you were 8. He becomes the center of an entire war or something 10 minutes after randomly appearing in the desert, and there is no clear reason why he's so important except that he can jump really far. Everybody he meets instantly knows how important he is even though he has the charisma of cornered animal. His female companion is of course the bestest at science, killing people, and being sassy.

I was a fan of the Marvel comic books of the character too. They did an outstanding job of bringing all of the characters to the screen in a well-thought out, believable way. They gave all characters real screen time for us to get to know and care about them. I haven't seen this kind of thing in a LOOONG time at the movies. The actors get to ""act"",.. even the computer generated ones. Such well-fleshed out characters. And more different alien cultures introduced than any movie I can remember. I loved that we got to see tribal cultures and their warriors. As well as, the shiny city dwellers and their worlds. I thought it was all very, very well done.

562,petracahill,Jasoom Woman has been to Barsoom and loved it!,10,3 March 2012,"Last night I got to see John Carter with my 18 yr old son and WOW what a movie! Let me tell you that I rarely read reviews, because I like to make up my own mind about movies! Some of the Headlines of reviews are so true. Burroughs is the granddaddy of Star Wars! The action in this movie was always there or right around the corner and it never got boring. It was not the edge of the seat movie, but it engrossed me so much so, that I did not want to get out of my seat in fear of missing anything. You wouldn't have any problems understanding the rest of the movie if you did. In my eyes this was a great adventure movie, with lots of action, drama a love story and even some comedy. The love story was pure and in no way shown off very sexual, as in other movies. The actors did a wonderful job in making the characters there own. I love Lynne Collins perception of her character Deja Thoris, which easily could stand her own amongst the strongest warrior of either race and never loose her sensuality! I thought that maybe Andrew Stanton did not feel completely confident in putting some comedic aspect in to the movie. There was no need to feel comedy was misplaced in this movie and think the audience appreciated it and possibly would have liked to see a bit more of it. In no way would more comedy have taken away of what Mr. Stanton was trying to bring across with this movie. I certainly enjoyed the comedic parts and maybe because of them my favorite character was James Purefoy's Kantos Kan. Although Mr. Purefoy's part was small, he showed how flawless and seamless you can combine a bit of comedy with the fact his character was a force to be reckoned with and should not be dismissed so easily. Most definitely a character I want to see more of!Don't get me wrong in thinking that I was looking for a comedy. I wanted an adventure and I got it!! I also enjoyed the fact that E. R. Burroughs got a part in the movie, which I think shows the appreciation and gratitude Mr. Stanton has toward Mr. Burroughs and his amazing writings. I do have to say I did 1 mistake of reading the Novelization of the movie before I got to see it. It would have made the surprise bigger not knowing what was coming up, but it did not take away from the excitement of the movie. I for one can recommend this movie to anyone, even if you never heard of Edgar Rice Burroughs or don't know any details about the John Carter of Mars books like my son, I think you will like it just like he did. He did so much so, that he couldn't stop talking about it afterward and at home. I will stick with my plan of going to see it on opening weekend and plan on taking my 11 yr old son with me this time! I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did! One thing I forgot to mention was, that we got to see it in 3D. I was skeptical about it. Some scenes really seemed too much in a sense it looked too quick and everything just faded within each other. But for the most part 3D worked perfectly! It did not look like or made you feel a bullet was coming at you, or a airship was going to crash on top of you but rather it made me feel I was part of the movie in standing in the midst or next to the action. So for me the 3D worked very well and I think I will go see it that way again.",John Carter

565,lowprise,Reviews not fair,9,17 November 2013,"The movie John Carter did not fair too well with the critics. I believe that this was from lack of information about the history of the Martian series by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Disney producers probably should have stuck with the original title, A Princess of Mars. Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote ten of these Martian stories a hundred years ago, with many science fiction ideas that have been used in just about every syfy movie since. If you read the books you will find the imagination and mind of a great author of Science fiction. It was difficult to explain the whole Martian series in the first movie. Maybe that is why George Lucas chose to start Star Wars at the end! I hope this does not dampen the chance for a sequel in the series! Next up The Gods of Mars!",John Carter
566,ff441980,A Movie That Deserves A Second Chance,8,20 July 2021,"Upon finally seeing this film, after hearing how it was dismissed, I was taken aback. ""John Carter"" should have never been panned and sadly should have done so much better at the box office. How a garbage movie like ""Black Panther"" got praised and ""John Cater"" rejected is beyond me. Without a doubt, ""John Carter"" deserves a second chance and could become better appraised over time. Most bad said about ""John Carter"" is wrong. The narrative is easy to follow, the characters are developed and the story cohesive and coherent: although the ending seemed rushed. The film has a magic like ""Star Wars"". How it can be called derivative is strange because ""John Carter"" is based on the imaginative writing of Edgar Rice Burroughs: an author who wrote years before ""Dune's"" Frank Herbert or ""Star Wars'"" George Lucas. If anything, Herbert's novels and Lucas' films owe a lot to Burroughs' creative and complex universe about the planet Barsoom. Two thumbs up!",John Carter
567,amdillow-1,A must see movie of epic proportions,10,16 March 2012,"If you truly want to create an epic movie a very good place to start is a classic science fiction masterpiece like ER Burroughs ""The princess of Mars"" AKA John Carter.With more than enough action and special effects to make any SF fan happy and enough comedy packed into it to make the kids and the wife lol to. Top the movie off with a fantastic script written by Buzz Lightyears father Andrew Stanton and you have IMO an epic movie worth watching and buying on Blu-Ray when it comes out too.Great Job Disney and Andrew Stanton I hope more of the epic series is coming.",John Carter

I don't think people do justice comparing it to films like Spiderman, in its uniqueness the only one i can compare to might be avatar although i think its better that Avatar! Simple,uncomplicated story, although there were twists, fantastic cinematography. Acting was also superb. I felt like a child transported to another world, Mars, a place i have always fatasized about. The story and location were so believable and realistic that i forgot all my troubles sitting in the cinema with my mouth open watching this film. This is one movie you will want to watch again and again.",John Carter
569,rsboswell,John Carter of Where?,2,14 April 2012,"Sadly, this film is an example of what could've been done but wasn't; and how it completely missed the boat. True, it helps if one did read any of Rice's stories in this series, but then you'd see that this was a bad mash-up of several of them, which ultimately leaves one with far more questions than they would start with. Kitsch is Captain Bland, or, Bleh ... no charisma, no presence for the role John Carter should be portraying. I found this screen character dull and lifeless, and, apparently in a position to pose a lot like he was on the cover of a Harlequin romance novel. Harris' portrayal of the Princess was the most convincing and entertaining. If any character carried the weight of this story, she did. But overall, for a film that dumped an obscene amount of money into it, so much more could have been done. I mean, really ... Utah is Utah folks, I don't care what color filter you put on a lens, you recognize the landscape. Why? Well, it's only been used in every science fiction film ever made (practically). And seriously, I lost count of how many scenes looked like they were ripped right out Star Wars fight scenes. Something like this should have been epic, in fact, so epic that I would have loved to have seen subsequent sequels. But it was missed, and that's too bad. This could have been something so different, it was all right there ... and if you're curious, read at least, the first book, you'll see why.",John Carter
570,dot_doctor,Great Family Movie - Hoping for Multiple Parts to Come,10,14 July 2012,"The previews looks good but the reviews came in shaky. Still the girls and I wanted to see John Carter. I am so very glad that we did. This was an excellent show! Engaging, moving, exciting, moral lesson and clean family enjoyment. What the movies have been missing for so long. As the scenes rolled by you were reminded of so many of your favorite shows (especially for SciFi fans like this family). You just can't get enough. I hope there are many more parts like Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potty. A Part 2 would not be enough. This is movie set up to live on for years to come. The story draws you in and is highly addictive. Just finished watching and already I want more.",John Carter
571,prasadsheshadri-779-73878,'Worst is Yet to come',5,11 March 2012,"Set on the distant red planet of Mars, the tale of the eponymous civil war soldier (Kitsch) caught up in a struggle for freedom and justice is a natural fit for producers Disney. There's the generic good-versus-evil conflict, sword-and-sorcery-style acrobatics, not to forget romance with a beautiful warrior-princess (Collins). Evidently designed to send sci-fi geeks into a tizzy, John Carter serves up an interminable yarn which fails to fully engage or excite. For all the running, leaping and fighting, the intrepid superhero's exploits are devoid of energy. The Pixar touch is evident in the precision of the visual detail and in the wit and energy of Michael Giacchino's score, but the quality control that has been exercised over this project also has a curiously undermining effect. After all those warning from ppl i had to try to understand what a $250million waste this was. This movie is there to stay on the hearts of viewers as one of the most lousiest ever with great special effects. The movie eagerly sells itself as semitrashy, almost-campy fun, but it is so lavish and fussy that you can't help thinking that it wants to be taken seriously, and therefore you laugh at, rather than with, its mock sublimity. Finally, If u are a fan of Sequel with 6 limbed toys running around in a desert. Well then this one may interest you.",John Carter
572,disneylandw,Disney's John Carter of Mars: Best looked at as a Pre-Star Wars,10,9 March 2012,"The red planet Mars is under a fierce war between the nations of Heluim and Zodanga as red tyrant Sab Than(Dominic West)is given a strange power blue weapon by the leader of the mysterious order known as the Holy Threns Matai Shang(Mark Strong)meanwhile on Earth(Jasoom to the martians) former civil war army-man turned cowboy John Carter is forcibly drafted by U.S colonial Powell(Bryan Cranston)who tells him outright to fight the Indians but by first escaping his cell and then unknowing leading them into a group of Indians,one of them wounding Powell and upon both discovering a strange small carven which holds both gold and a silent guardian which try to kill Carter but upon shooting him the man utters the words of ""Barsoom"" before dying and uttering it sends Carter to Mars...The scientist daughter to the great Jaddak of Heluim Dejah Thoris(Lynn Collins)has discover the power behind Sab Than's newest weapon which is some new form of energy called the Ninth Ray but not hearing a word of it Tardos Mors(Ciaran Hinds)tells her she would have to soon marry Sab Than in order to ensure peace between the nations but instead runs away and right into the arms of our hero and his large green captors the savage nomads known as the Tharks under the leadership of Tars Tarkas(Willem Defoe)who keeps getting underhanded by the brute Tal Haljus and the high priestess of the Tharks Sarkoja(Polly Walker)as well as allies of the tribe including Sola(Samantha Morton)and the guard dog to the baby Tharks Wooa,and soon after showing off his amazing jump skills(do the lesser gravity of Mars as opposite to that of Earth)by saving the princess and confronting Sab Than only briefly does he learn that he is on another planet,and only after both escape the city of the Tharks that they learn a little bit more about what the Holy Threns are planning,only in Zodanga does Carter get to learn the full sinister plans of Matai Shang can he be ready to save a planet is not his own...For these who like old fashioned sci-fi this film(and the original novel) get everything from a beautiful princes,the odd Martian wild life(the cute Wooa,the rhino look Thoats that ridden around as horses and finally the large dangerous alien gorillas known as the White Apes)great green warriors which seem to be savage cousins to the classic UFO Grey aliens,an evil arrogant empire and finally big battles that became the hallmarks of the original Star Wars trilogy as well the Flash Gordon serials(Sab Than does seems a lot like Ming the Merciless including wanting to marry the love interest of the hero) And for Pixar Director Andrew Standon's first live action debut does a pretty good job with following the novel's plot(as the the other screenwriters of Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon) including having the book's author Edger Rice Burroughs(Daryl Sabara)at the center of it as he reads his uncle Carter's interplanetary story from his diary,which in the end becomes more clearer as the film draws to a close,Collins as Princess Dejah is most defiantly my favorite in terms of Disney trying to do something of a live action Disney princess or at least since Kera Knightley's Elizabeth Swan in the Pirates of the Caribbean series,and Taylor Kitsch plays a rather rough damaged goods hero whose almost kind like Han Solo except with more a tragic past that involved sadly his previous wife and child dying that makes him feel he shouldn't even get invoke with the martians and there problems until Dejah shows him that he does need someone worth fighting for,the CGI is really quite well done though the martian green men tribes of the Tharks and the Warhoons(who are shown during a great and brutal battle scene as he cuts them down with his two swords as it cuts to his tragic moment of burying his wife and child)Burroughs's green men of Mars seem to be something of an inspiration for the honor bound warrior race of Star Trek's Kilgons. Its really the best Edger Rice Burroughs adaption Disney has done since there 1999 animated version of Tarzan and in some ways surpasses least some of the Tarzan films or even the 70s productions of Burroughs's At the Earth's Core and the Land that Time Forget and yeah for a PG-13 Disney film it is a lot more violet then the later Pirates of The Caribbean sequels but there is a lot of humor including from both Wooa and the captain of the Heluim navy Kantos Kan(James Purefoy)or how Carter is first indicated to way the Tharks treat there young in there dungeon nursery.So overall i do recommend this Disney film ignoring the overall negative reviews its somehow getting(and i really don't know why since i actually liked this film and also reading the book the Princess of Mars)also its away better version then the low budget 2009 Asylum production that starred Antonio Sabato Jr as John Carter and Traci Lords as Dejah Thoris",John Carter
573,sincityq,Exactly as imagined in the 19th century,8,6 June 2012,"John Carter, the movie - that is, took the time to present a few items pretty much as one might have seen them in the latter half of the 19th century. Carter's leaping ability on Mars being the most obvious. The stories, as originally written, used simple math to imagine what the gravity would be like to an Earthling on Mars. Of course, most people overlook that because most have never read the original story of John Carter of Mars.Visually stunning, this is a steam-punk dream come true. The scripting did what it could to trace the original story to make it understandable to the somewhat limited minds of the 21st century. My only comment that would come in negative is in the marketing of this great movie; it failed Rice Burroughs by altering the title for fear of mentioning that name of 'Mars' in the that title.8-of-10 is an honest opinion from my standpoint. This flick is well worth watching for those who enjoy honest sci-fi in an age when that honesty is almost an anachronism... now having been replaced by fantasy. Enjoy :)",John Carter
574,Love_of_Film,A disappointing departure from the original story.,5,24 June 2017,"This movie could have been the start of a very successful franchise. Unfortunately, the writers and the director seem to have decided that their ad lib on the original story by Burroughs would be better. They added a nonsensical magic priest cult that has nothing to do with the original story to make it more believable... This is a work of fiction! Believable? I've read the books so many times and was looking so much forward to seeing it made into a movie. The writer/director destroyed Burroughs carefully crafted story. I doubt that he was a fan of Burroughs or even heard of the Mars series until he was hired as a last resort for this project. Read the books! It is so much better than this movie. I wish someone who loved these books by Burroughs, someone like Peter Jackson and how he materialized Tolkien's works, would redo this movie right. ""The Hobbit"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" also had a bunch of flops made before Peter Jackson. One can only hope.",John Carter

The special effects are good here and there although this certainly looks like a B grade movie that doesn't even come close to Avatar.If you are going to watch this thinking that you are going to get an avatar like experience, just forget about it.

Disney & Stanton had a chance at a potential real gem and blew it. They ripped the guts out of the story. I am getting to really hate movies that are ""based upon"" or ""inspired by"" a great piece of literature. If you can come up with a better story and presentation - great - I am all for it. But this movie seemed like an assigned project in college that just had to get done even if done badly.Even all of the reviewers I read did not comment on the differences with the book. Many of the negative reviews did comment on the lack of dialogue and the poor acting. Also the romance between the main characters was not believable precisely because the great dialogue and interplay was left out.To all of those reviewers who are looking for the dialogue, the character building, and even the action - I say, go read the book. It is all there. That is why this movie angers me. The film-makers had great source material but did not use it. This is a sad commentary on the film-makers of today.",John Carter
578,clarkpark24,It Could Be Worse,1,19 July 2012,"I discovered John Carter in comic books in 1962 – fifty years after he first appeared in All- Story in 1912. So I only waited fifty years for someone to make the movie.Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote and sold more than sixty novels, many of them still in print sixty years after his death. A fair conclusion to draw is that he was a first rate storyteller. His initial effort, A Princess of Mars, gets its basic story line from the delusions of Percival Lowell, who saw vague lines on the Martian landscape and imagined canals and a dying civilization. Burroughs fleshed this out and added so many creative concepts: dwindling seas; mixing races; an eighth component of visible light that defies gravity; twelve foot tall green Martians with tusks that curved up the sides of theirs faces, past their eyes to even with the ears atop their heads. But his best devices were the immortal and un-aging John Carter and the chivalric nobility of the red Martians of Helium, the greatest of dehydrating Mars' cities.I read A Princess of Mars in novel form in the 1975 and the other ten novels over the next twenty years. Director Andrew Stanton, with Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon, who collectively wrote the screenplay, clearly never read John Carter in any format.For whatever reason – my guess is wholly unwarranted egomania – Stanton decided to forego every one of Burroughs' plot elements and character traits. The result is a movie that proves that one monkey with a typewriter can't write Shakespeare, or even a movie that's coherent or moderately interesting.The casting is a travesty. The acting is mediocre. The screenplay adds pointless complications to the plot while jettisoning everything in it that worked, and makes every principle character infinitely less interesting and empathetic than Burroughs created them.Not satisfied with taking a wrecking ball to a great story, Stanton manages to get nearly every detail wrong, showing a cavalry fort with a blockhouse and no stockade, and Phobos and Diemos in half phase in the Martian sky, always next to each other, and visible at midday. Diemos is so tiny that it's never brighter on Mars than Venus is here on earth. Phobos, larger but only 3700 miles above Mars, crosses the sky in a little over four hours and completes over four orbits for each one of Diemos'. Both are among the least reflective bodies in the solar system, and neither is particularly close to round. I don't think I've ever before encountered anyone who had no respect for great authors or the solar system.I can't say John Carter is the worst movie ever made, but only because I haven't seen every movie ever made. It's unquestionably the biggest waste of celluloid that I ever wasted two hours of my life on.",John Carter

The effects are pretty good, but the 3d is just average , didn't have many in your face effects. the picture was pretty dark and gave me a headache after the intermission. The story offers lot of potential, but needs some understanding. Action is great but few and far between I felt. Expected to be lifted off my seat with the action but was disappointed. The actors did their bit , really liked the lead lady, gorgeous she is in the face department, the body a little manly for my taste. There is a twist in the end , nothing too fantastic. I really hope there isn't part 2. I will try never again to watch a 3d movie.

To be true I even had very low -no at all- expectations about this movie after seeing in a trailer months ago the scene when ""Vorginia""'s hurled to the arena to fight the White Apes; I remember me thinking ""Yuck! What a bad copy of Avatar, and they said this movie have a u$s 250.000.000 budget? My God!

I mean, every detail has been taken care in this movie, and we are talking of a movie of 2:45hs duration that seems to long only half an hour: that's my definition of a good movie!! It was very funny to see John kiss the floor once and again when he learned how to walk on martian soil and even it was funnier every time he crashes his plane (into the sands), you say ""this guy keeps hitting himself to the floor, seems the only way he knows to land, :D!"" And what about the very first massive fighting scene at the Tharks town skies between the Red and Blue armies? That was a classical pirate's action scene -like all-time classic Captain Blood or, for instance Scaramouche- that works very well for me, sweet! The only difference this time is the fighting happens at a very high altitude from the ground on flying machines and in Mars! - as Wayne and Garth would say: EXCELLENT! :DThis movie has action, suspense, love, an intriguing storyline, you know this is a sweet movie that I really enjoyed at my 34ys that surely could blow my mind if I were a kid instead of a grown up.Hey, it even has at least one interesting parliament: Matai Shang: ""To truly demoralize a nation requires a public spectacle on the grandest scale."" (That's reminds me certain event back in 2001)Have I mentioned the detail put in the Carter's manor, in his study? And of course I can't leave out Woola, to everyone who loves dogs, he is lovely :)This is an excellent movie and I hope we see more adventures from John Carter of Mars, they're a refreshing and welcome addition to the sci-fi world.Finally I want to thank everyone involved in the making of this film and apologize from my foolish words about what I presumed this movie was to be, I'm really, really happy I was wrong :) thank you!!",John Carter
584,strawhat_sylar,Suckerpunched at the End!!!!Great Movie,8,17 March 2012,"John Carter for me really started out slow,I mean from my expectations on the trailer I would look at it as a high pumping adrenaline-fueled movie(which it is,just not in the beginning).But I think its a sacrifice to listen to(sometimes) lengthy dialog at the start because it really builds up the story..and it also puts questions on reader's minds about certain key elements which will be explained in the end which does have a nice twist.. As for the story like I said it start slow like a train locomotive,but builds and builds until you're sucked in with Carter in the grandeur and epicness of the planet Barsoom(Mars).The story for me is one of the greatest equalizer in the film since it has a great story of a man who lost everything and then trying to redeem himself in an epic way of like...saving a whole planet?!what you say to that..and of course getting the girl. While the story is great,the graphics and special effects are bad-ass and the key factor of the film..the representation of Mars in the film is really fantastic,epic and beautiful and in the same time dreadful because it is in the end of its time after all.The CGI rendering of the mars natives are really mouth,watering and the creatures are spectacular and pleasing to watch.

Still Lynn Collin's brilliant performance as Dejah Thoris can keep even the most jaded of us geriatric cases teetering on the edge of our power chairs as she seduces the chauvinistic southern cavalry colonel John Carter (played by Stacy Keitch) who reluctantly takes the Princess of Mars under his wing and defeats evil in its 18th century incarnation.

The characters felt real, John Carter was a great protagonist with an incredibly sad back-story, and the dog was surprisingly adorable. Also, I never thought I would feel human emotions for big green aliens. Everything; action, special effects, acting, writing, story, music; was seamed together seamlessly.

Allegory, doncha know. For him Mars was pretty much the last word in 'alien'. Not knowing any better he assumed we'd all be able to breathe there and would probably move there and set up camp by 1956.The film is pretty faithful to the books' ethos and that's probably why it's not much good. Nicely filmed. Good for family viewing. Don't take teenagers over 14 though as they will walk out halfway through making gun gestures.Teenage tastes have changed.

This is the reason that these little children's adventure is actually a serious film for adults.

The acting in the film is generally good, the visual effects were believable and much better than seeing some rubber prosthetic mask for the Tharks and I thought the cinematography of the film was used in good to effect. The story if brief is from what I can tell is a mix up of two of the books from Edgar Rice Burrough's series.I can't obviously see why this has been slated, it's a film of good quality and for me a film that sits quite high in my film collection.",John Carter

It was very much worth the wait.The casting was top notch. From Cirian Hinds, to Dominic West, to Mark Strong, Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins and Willem Dafoe, you never once thought Gee, look at so and so act. You believed they were who they portrayed.The acting was better than what would be expected for a special effects movie, and with the above mentioned cast it is no wonder.The special effects were outstanding. Forget an X-Wing fighter, I want one of those fliers from the movie. Oh, and while we are at it, I want one of the swords.Most of all, after seeing the movie, I want to go to Mars.",John Carter

If you have not seen the movie yet and DO NOT want to know anything about the movie, stop reading now!I must say Lynn Collins was a perfect pick for the part she played. Her acting is fresh...as her looks are too! Most critics seem to have been disappointed by this movie but I liked it a lot! The emotionally tortured, reluctant hero is always an attractive character...never really wanting to be there but doing it because it's the right thing to do...then throw this character up on Mars where his body density makes him stronger than most being able to leap 50 yards at a time and now we have the makings of a great hero! Over all, I will watch this movie again and again...enjoying it every time!!!",John Carter
594,small-corgi,Excellent Movie,10,16 September 2012,"1) So many US movies are about boring, trivial garbage --someone's love affair go bad or the life of pathetic people goes awry. It is rare that a movie is made with a grand vision. John Carter is such a movie. 2) In my opinion I think some of the critics dishonestly trashed it--but then unimportant scum hate grandeur. Because It reminds them that they are scum who create only boring trash. 3) Scum are people who spent $200,000 on a college education but are failures at creating anything of value. They seethe at the fact that Hollywood has earned $1.8 Billion in films based on Marvel comic books while everyone ignores the scripts of the overeducated scum. 3) On the other hand, maybe the Therns killed it. Because the observation of a hidden cult promoting wars and feeding off the ensuing carnage certainly rings true today.",John Carter

596,mikesilva1995,Great movie despite lame movie critic reviews,10,20 August 2021,I didn't understand why this movie was condemned before it was even released. I delayed watching it because of what the movie critics said. Then a friend encouraged me to watch it and I was surprised to find it was actually a great movie. It has a great cast of stars and the story line is develops well. Highly recommended.,John Carter
597,adimholz,Very Good-Wish Preformed Better In Sales,9,30 September 2013,"Very well done, it truly gives the feel of the Martian world. I have often heard criticizism that the film was not a new plot or idea and copied other films. This is impossible due to the fact the movie was based on a book written over a hundred years ago, which many of the ""originals"" draw from. Not only is the film fairly close to the book of it's origin, it uses large and very well done effects that will be able to stand in time without looking dated and silly in a few years. Over all I'd recommend this to any sci-fi fan or adventure fan. My only wish was that it preformed better in sales so a possible sequel could have been made.",John Carter
598,sauronmike,Exceptional,9,13 May 2014,"*Short Review*When i first saw this movie, i thought that the plot wasn't leading anywhere. Until the end of the movie. Then i realized, how awesome movie it is. The movie was all-in-one, it had action, a little drama and a great story.But it had that unique feeling, like the movie itself, makes you pay so much attention to it, that it literally makes you travel with John Carter at Mars, living his adventures. That's a great thing for a movie like this, i really loved it.The cast was pretty good, the effects were amazing, but i think that the movie could be a little longer. At least, that's what the fans probably want, after watching this great movie. If Disney makes a sequel for this, i'll be the first one in line to see it.-Michael",John Carter
599,adtvtxjuno,The professional critics are wrong,9,2 February 2014,The professional critics are wrong. This was a great entertaining movie. I don't know why people black balled it. I finally bought it because it was hard to find. It's as fun to watch now as it was when I first saw it at a sold out movie theater. Even my coworkers were confused why Hollywood critics hated it. This review is too little too late.If I were to compare similar movies then I would say it is like the Riddick series and Prince of Persia two other movies critics taunted because they lack the vision of youthful adventure. If these critics were around in the past then we would've never had stories like treasure Island.,John Carter
600,rmadigan55,What was the director thinking?,4,15 May 2019,"I've read the book series many times and seen the movie atleast 6 times. How can anyone think they are making a movie from a novel and not even come close to it. Other than the names of the characters and the place names, nothing else is from any of the books. Why would Stanton change everything? The original story is perfect. All he had to do is follow the book and he would have made a beautiful, stunning movie. With today's special effects, he could have brought ERB's Barsoom to life and told the story in amazing detail.On the positive side, he did do some things that warrant recognition. Although I would've loved to see Lynn Collins the way Dejah Thoris is portrayed in the novels. I can understand why all the Barsoomians are not nude. It was a great idea to add the tattoos instead of nudity. The photography is fantastic as are the costumes. The CGI is outstanding. The Tharks are truly brought to life.All I can hope for is if there ever is a sequel, someone else will direct it and stick to the novel.",John Carter
601,wolfbro44,Great story,10,30 November 2020,"The story that is told within this movie is both entertaining humorous amazing character building and done with very good actors in all of the roles just when you think you know how it's going to go it changes.

I don't know a great deal about the pulp novels that it was based on to know if its radically different, but I thought that for what it was was something entertaining. I have watched it several times since it was released and would gladly watch it again. I think there was a lot of bad marketing for this film. I could see where it may have gotten some eyebrows because it appears to copy the Star Wars prequels and Avatar plots. The John Carter stories were written in the early 20th century and a great deal of the content that we see in Star Wars and Avatar are shamelessly stolen from John Carter (here looking at you George Lucas for Episode II). It should have been marketed as something as the foundation of science fiction, before star wars, before avatar there was John Carter. Take it for what it is, a popcorn, exciting family movie. Don't expect it to be deep or thought-provoking, that's a different genre.",John Carter
604,amavt,A Strange Story,9,22 September 2018,"John Carter is a Movie that did not find its public when released. I personally thoroughly enjoyed it, but never the less no one appreciated it. The reason is unknown: the movie has great acting, cgi, is gruesome for a Disney movie creates an interesting universe with a rich panel of characters. There is just the idea that it came after Star Wars that may be the cause of its failure.
I hope it will find its public just like once upon time in america or the rocky horror picture show. It is that good and deserve more praise. I wish for it to become a classic.
Bonus: the book it's adapted from was an inspiration to Star Wars.
Go Watch It !",John Carter

606,suffolkbansheefilms,Absolutely Marvellous,8,14 March 2012,"A delirious slice of pulp fantasy channelling the wide-eyed innocence and schoolboy excitement of the original Star Wars Trilogy, John Carter is a madcap space opera, beautifully scored and cunningly wrought, with a real sense of wonder often missing in more cynical blockbuster fare. Taylor Kitsch steps neatly into the leading role with enough gravelly self-deprecation to evoke the spirit of Han Solo, Superman and even Conan the Barbarian, playing a character that pre-dated and heavily influenced all three, and the delightful, impossibly gorgeous Lynn Collins is wonderful as Dejah Thoris, the fabled princess of Mars of Edgar Rice Burroughs' imaginings with a modern twist, not so much damsel in distress as feisty Jedi Knight. It's a role she was born to play, and I can't be alone in thinking that an even slightly younger actor would not have brought enough gravitas and appeal to a role which could have been reduced to simpering eye-candy in the wrong hands; Collins plays it perfectly, and so capably demonstrates what a thirysomething actor has to offer that a twentysomething actor simply could not do. The pair have genuine chemistry, sometimes in spite of the occasional preposterous line (thankfully ""ninth ray isolates"" feature far less heavily than, say, The Phantom Menace's ""midichlorians"", argh!), and director Andrew Stanton shows the same deft mix of thoughtful romance and frantic action he previously displayed in Wall-E; some of John Carter's strongest moments come where pulp scifi fun is laid to one side for a moment, and the wonderful score by Michael Giacchino, not to mention Lynn Collins' hypnotic blue eyes, are allowed to do the talking.A fine stable of classically trained actors – playing four-armed, hulking green aliens, Martian Kings and Generals, and mysterious, scheming demigods – provide excellent support. Ciaran Hinds and James Purefoy, formerly Caesar and Mark Antony in HBO's excellent ""Rome"", stand out as the leaders of a warring Martian state of Helium, bringing a lot of charisma to only a few moments of screen time. And Samantha Morton and Willem Dafoe are exceptional as John Carter's Thark allies, playing motion-captured aliens with so much heart and presence, you'll suspend your disbelief instantly. The Wire's Dominic West, though criminally underused, is sufficiently charming and smarming as the villainous Zodangan general. Even the CGI dog is charming. The weakest link is Mark Strong, playing one of John Carter's supervillanous Thurns, who just manages to avoid phoning it in; it's a role you've seen him play many times before.8/10. I haven't scored this any higher because it's a truly, wonderfully ridiculous film, and for that reason alone it won't be to everyone's taste. Corn-fed viewers raised on the Saw Films, the X Factor and a recent spate of terrible superhero fodder (Green Lantern??) may not appreciate John Carter's classic pedigree. But for anyone who ever loved pulp Saturday Matinees, 80's scifi, HP Lovecraft, Robert E Howard, Lando Calrissian, Indiana Jones or that roar Chewbacca makes (Star Wars was ridiculous in its day, too) then you'll love this. Absolutely marvellous. I hope American Audiences this coming weekend are persuaded by the stunning success of John Carter overseas, because I can't wait for the sequel.",John Carter
607,undiscoveredpro,Solid Film...Undeserving of Bad Press,9,14 May 2012,"The power of suggestion is such that it destroys its subject instantly.This film's reputation was ruined by industry insiders and the press before its release...Likely, a competing company leaked the false ideas out and people followed mindlessly. Clearly, other film companies benefited as audience money was driven elsewhere.I went to see this film because I only judge for myself and because I had read several Edgar Rice Burroughs novels as a kid...He was a gifted storyteller, had the best imagination ever and gave us heroics unseen to date unless you read his books which have been ripped off by Star Wars, Avatar and many other ""intellectual properties."" I won't remark on the story other than to say, like all films intended to have sequels, it suffered a bit because it had to lay the groundwork for what is to come.The acting was good, the leads were very likable and the best part is that they didn't use known actors for the cast. The effects were good and the creatures were great but the setting is on a barren landscape so don't expect the lush jungles of Avatar (which was an inferior and predictable film).The only criticism I have is that it was given a child friendly rating. If it was made with a grittier, more mature sensibility it would have bee more enjoyable for me.Note: See it without the 3D.Don't be a follower. Judge for yourself. This film deserves to be seen on a big screen. You will be pleasantly surprised...I can't wait to see a sequel (several in fact as there were eleven books in the series).",John Carter

609,chalker23@hotmail.com,Awesome!!!!!!!,9,14 March 2012,"Just saw John Carter in imax 3D and having not read the books I wasn't sure what to expect. Boy what a great time at the movies. From curtain up until the end credits I was completely captivated by the world that Andrew Stanton and his team put up on the screen. The SFX were nothing short of amazing and the action scenes were spectacular. All the actors were spot on. Willem Dafoe was great as Tars Tarkas, Taylor Kitcsh was good as John Carter but I think my favourite was Lynn Collins as Dejah. Aside for being not had to look at, as soon as she is on screen you know that this is a woman to be reckoned with and has such a great presence on screen that she might even overshadow John Carter if not for the great chemistry between Taylor and Lynn. Loved the movie, Stanton did an awesome job and for the life of me i cannot figure out where all the hate is coming from. I hope that time will prove all those critics wrong, John Carter will make lots of money and sequels will come sooner rather then later.",John Carter
610,filmpixel,"Great Movie, Poorly Marketed",9,10 April 2012,"This movie, like Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge was a great, phenomenal movie that did not fit the established formula; therefore the marketing department didn't know how to fit it into their marketing mold.Every major successful Sci Fi movie trailer alludes to the love story baked into the plot. The marketing didn't do a good job of either sensualizing the incredibly sexy male and female lead actors. (Was this the same marketing team responsible for Tron?) The title doesn't make sense unless you watch the movie, thefy should have marketed it under a more compelling and connective title. The acting, direction, effects and set design were on par with epic of Lord of the Rings caliper, but the marketing was 40 Year old Virgin. Marketing department: shame on you!Disney, please purge your marketing staff, or only feed them with your typical fare, as they clearly didn't know what to do with this masterpiece.",John Carter

612,borreguero,"leave your brain at home, then enjoy this trash",1,21 May 2012,"This movie has some remarkable feats. For instance, it's choked full of action yet it made me deeeeeply bored. Watching face-slapping can be funny, but you kind of loose interest after the 100th time.I was impressed with Ciarán Hinds' acting. He had like ten lines in the whole movie. Good for him, otherwise he could have risked saying something plain, like the others. Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins play the two main characters. You can feel they are aware of how much crap their lines are, but I guess they're happy since Disney showers them with big bucks. You know there's something fishy in a movie when some of the CGI characters are deeper and portray more emotion than most of the human actors. It can only mean the movie is as shallow as a politician's promise.I love science-fiction movies (starship troopers, blade runner), but hey, where's the ""science"" part in this utterly dumb, washed-down reel? I warn you, you'll find a denser plot in a porn movie. It's impossible to give spoilers because this disaster lacks a script.IMDb should seriously leave room for negative stars. One star is a lot to concede to this crap.",John Carter
613,timcory,Outstanding Movie!,9,24 March 2012,"Well, I don't know what the clueless critics are yipping about regarding this movie not worth seeing, but both me (I'm 45yrs old) and my 10 yr old son thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Simply summarized:Loads of action.Fantastic story.Great acting.Warm ending. (what else would you expect, it's Disney!)The only 2 things that I could criticize are:1) The sound seemed sub-average? It didn't seem powerful enough or ""surround sound"" enough for me and the theatre we were in is well kept, not old & normally phenomenal for any other big budget movies seen in it. 2) Personally, I didn't see the need for the 3D, although my 10 yr old son who has A.D.D. said afterwards it felt like only 45 minutes had passed by, not the more than 2 hours the movie it is and he didn't take his medication like I normally suggest whenever we see a movie to keep him interested and not bouncing around in his seat. If that doesn't say something about how entertaining the movie is, I don't know what else could? So, my opinion, DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BONEHEAD MOVIE CRITICS and pay whatever it costs to see a great flick. I'm looking forward to seeing it again once it's released on DVD on my 70"" LCD with the stereo blaring out! Cheers.",John Carter
614,ColoradoGuy,Burroughs Would be Mortified,5,16 March 2012,"I'll give it a 5 for the CGI which, except for some scenes I'll note in a minute, was OK. Having read the original novels both many years ago, and again just last month, I found the Tharks looked like I'd expect, Woola looked cuter than I'd expect (but was just as lovable as Burroughs described), the Therns looked like Therns, but the Red Martians seemed far too pale. Some of them were as ""white"" as John Carter. Seems with a $250 million budget they could have spent a little more on make-up.As for CGI, the close-ups of the Tharks and beasts were fine, but oddly, I found the distant scenes such as the one with the Tharks riding their thoats across the desert, to look somehow cheesy. They looked like tiny animations rather than 15 foot giants riding huge beasts. As for the 3D, it was just passable, maybe better than ""Clash of the Titans"", but not worth the extra charge.On to the story itself -- of course, the movie bears little resemblance to the fabulous fiction of Edgar Rice Burroughs. The film screenplay is a badly mangled adaptation of Burroughs works, with added events that didn't help make any sense of the thing, and a mixture of parts of the first two books of the original five-book series. The acting was ""campy"" which may have been intentional, but with the script they had to work with ... well, not much could be done! There were only a few people in the theater when we saw it today, and several of them broke out in laughter over some of the dialog, and the dialog in those particular scenes was not intended to be funny. The relationship of Carter and Deja Thoris was complex and extended over much of the first book, but in the film it was facile.The action scenes in the movie were beyond belief -- and this is one area where the film actually echos the original books. Burroughs' battle scenes were described in gory detail (for the early 1900's at least) and Carter's skill as a ""fighting man"" were quite unbelievable. So the film got that right! All in all, save your money until it hits the Two Dollar Cinema, or catch it on the 'Net when it arrives there. If you've got nothing else to do and don't mind wasting money, go see it in 3D.",John Carter
615,rjheckma,Convoluted John Carter,1,16 June 2012,"Not being familiar with the John Carter stories, I simply had no clue to what was going on in this film. Saying it was convoluted is being kind. One minute I was in the present, then it abruptly changed to reflections from his past and then magically inserted future vignettes. Not of these tied together in my mind at all. If you are looking for characters to care about. Characters that you understand and can either root for or empathize with..........well,this isn't the movie. After 1 1/2 hours, I was still wondering who John Carter was and what he was up to. Then I fell asleep. When I awoke, I was still completely puzzled by the lack of definition as presented by this film of John Carter and the clear and compelling character of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan series. I know that the books were highly successful, so this production simply missed the mark. Perhaps the assumption was made that the viewer had read the books before entering the theater.

Perhaps my expectations were low and made it that way, but it appears to be true to the book's wonder- not all true but relatively true. It is a different sci-fi story filled with wonder, magic and love. My husband and I really enjoyed it and we left appreciating all the special effects the producers made. I particularly liked the dog and the screaming green babies. It had heart and detail. Sure, one can think leaving- wow that was cheesy but one can also say that about avatar, star-wars, spider-man, etc... If you want to be excessively critical and not let your mind go into the world of imagination then I suppose you can say whatever you want but it is not suppose to be real.

Really surprised to find a film which had a good plot line (albeit cynics will liken it to Avatar-lite), well acted, reasonable characterisations, brilliant visuals and a surprisingly good hero figure in Taylor Kitsch. I saw the preview screening this morning - don't really care how much it cost to make - what I found was a big budget film that I really enjoyed from start to finish. My advice - don't follow the cynics and naysayers - see it for yourself. I will normally not go see 3D films (they give me a headache) but the 3D wasn't too intrusive on this one.",John Carter

I plan on reading the book now that I have so enjoyed this movie. Then I am going to see this movie again. I love going to movies to escape into fantasy and that is exactly what happened.

From my point of view, this one is better than Avatar in some details.The characters, landscapes, machines, story ... Every little detail is beautiful and breath taking. And it is really quiet shocking to know that the book for this movie was written in 1910 s . What an imagination.It runs for around two and a half hours, but let me tell you something, i really felt there should be more. I could not keep track of time while watching. I was really disappointed when the movie was over because i only thought, just an hour has passed. The atmosphere just gets you and you have no idea of how much time has passed.

622,theshak06,It got a bad rap but really its a great movie,8,14 July 2012,When I first heard about this movie in Ireland I must say it was advertised totally wrong. The ads & the trailers really didn't do it justice. I heard it was a huge flop and I was surprised as reviewers I followed online really liked it. When I finally watched the movie for myself I will admit my expectations were low but boy was I wrong. I really enjoyed John Carter and while it was not perfect you could really see the director was trying to cover as many plot holes as possibles with small expositions here and there. As well as that the story (for me anyway) never got boring. At first I thought it was heading towards cliché territory but then there was a twist and that would keep happening right till the end.This movie is what i was consider a hidden gem. It was really advertised very poorly and Im convinced thats why it was received badly. Don't judge a book by its cover and watch this movie. I am convinced you will be quietly surprised :).,John Carter

As a sci-fi fan I was really annoyed when read a review, humiliating it by comparing it to Avatar. I got to say where Avatar lacked genuine plot (men destroying The New and eventually are defeated) this one has a great plot (which same as always is not up to scratch for those who have read the original book). You got to admit Movies' plot may never topple the standard set by the set-upon-books, because book is just a plot while movie has to concentrate on many aspects. Anyways I got to say plot isn't exceptional but I loved the twist at the end. Visually it's amazing while john's jumping sucks at times other visual effects are marvelous.

624,SonofLiberty2,Science Fiction and Adventure at its Best,10,26 March 2012,"First of all, I was never a fan of Burroughs' novels....until recently. Seeing the first trailer for this movie spurred me to finally read A Princess of Mars and the second in the series, The Gods of Mars. I was intrigued with Burroughs' ability to mix science fiction with adventure in a way that Jules Vernes simply could not match. Now, for the movie, I thought it was an excellent adaptation. While it is not a word for word adaptation of the book, it is faithful enough to thrill both old time fans of Burroughs, and be very enjoyable for newcomers to the world of Barsoom. This truly is the root of all modern space epics. The plot, the effects, and the pace of the film will surprise you at how fast 2 hours can go by. As to the detractors of the film.....see it first. There is far more science here than fiction. Nanotechnology, fusion, and whispers of Tesla throughout the film go unnamed but are there for those who understand their basic premises. Burroughs, somewhere in eternity, may yet have the last laugh when we someday visit Mars and began to closely study its past.",John Carter
625,sellers-michael,John Carter: A surprising gem that shines bright and true,10,28 February 2012,"Star Wars, Avatar, and John Carter. That's the cinema progression although by now everyone knows that the John Carter books came first and inspired both Lucas and Cameron. As a devotee of the books -- I appreciated Star Wars and Avatar, but neither produced the level of excitement and reader/viewer loyalty that Edgar Rice Burroughs did with his vivid and unforgettable tales of John Carter, Dejah Thoris, and Barsoom.So what has Andrew Stanton given us?Anwer: A gem that shines bright and true with a light all its own. Stanton has taken the grandmaster's story but he's made it his own and it's fresh and emotionally stirring in ways that are unexpected and make you want to see it a second time, and soon. The gem is not without a few rough edges -- but the core brilliance is unmistakable and undeniable.Stanton is a subtle and sophisticated storyteller with a Pixarian's understanding of how to build characters that stay with you. Whereas Cameron in Avatar was content to extract the simple essence of the Burroughsian pulp narrative and just ""go with it"", Stanton keeps enough of that to keep the material recognizable but constructs characters that, in deft and certain strokes, emerge as fully realized beings who engage us and draw us in to their stories in ways that exceed what his predecessors Burroughs, Lucas, and Cameron were able to do. The result is a richer, character driven experience that transcends the dear sweet old pulpy fiber on which it is based and becomes something grander, richer, and more satisfying.A word about how the film differs from what you're seeing in trailers: The promotion promises spectacle and action and there is plenty of that; but the promotion also suggests that the film will be a kind of childishly simple, woodenly executed mashup of questionable seriousness featuring awkward performances and cartoonish characterization while the film itself is almost the inverse of that--a thoughtful, finely tune spectacle that is a feast of imaginative transport and whose few flaws flow from the fact that it's a three hour epic that plays in two hours and twelve minutes.Taylor Kitsch is convincing and natural and I never thought I'd be saying that, based on the promotion. Lynn Collins is luminous and elevates fully to the level of the ""incomparable"" Princess of Helium -- genuinely beautiful and strong of will and heart. Willem Dafoe as Tars Tarkas and Samantha Morton as Sola; Mark Strong as the delicious villain Matai Shang -- the cast is without exception strong. The special effects are state o the art and seamless -- and the music by Michael Giachinno deserves special mention: haunting, unique, and uniquely suited to the material, and the editing by Eric Zumbrunnen seamlessly supports the narrative.The ""flaws"" amount to quibbles: The film feels lean and compact at 2 hours and 12 minutes and feels as if it could benefit greatly from 10 additional minutes which could have been used profitably to better set up the moment when John Carter and Dejah Thoris ""close the deal"" on their love, and clarify some story points that are there -- but could be highlighted more. Another beat of John Carter's life among the Tharks, implying a passage of time, would cause John Carter's later knowledge of the Tharks and their culture to make more sense (as it is now he seems to pick it up in a matter of days and as audience we never see where that knowledge comes from ). Another beat of John Carter absorbing the new world he finds himself in, and implicitly comparing it to what he left behind, would be welcome and would strengthen the impact we would feel when he makes that choice. But these minor points should not distract for the overall brilliance with which Stanton has executed a challenging assignment.This is a film that bears watching more than once, and is complex and nuanced enough that subsequent viewings will no doubt reveal new treasures and clarify the minor rough edges -- yet it is also compelling and moving on an immersive first viewing in the theater. Perhaps the best indication of that is the fact that, in spite of my supposed knowledge of and sensitivity to film structure -- I was taken by surprise when it ended and was in no way ready for it to end. Could the full two hours have gone by that fast? How? And as I sit here writing about it the next morning, if there were an opportunity to go back and see it again tonight, I would do so without hesitation and, quibbles aside, that's a simple but ultimately profound recommendation.A final thought: Like everyone, I've got plenty of things going on in my life and my world, distracting things, things that makes me worry, things that drag my mind out of a movie when I'm watching it and back into my world. Not one little tiny bit of that intruded into this movie. I was transported and when it was over I couldn't believe that was it -- I thought there was at least another 45 minutes owed to the audience. On a visceral level, without trying to overthink it -- that says a lot about what Andrew Stanton has accomplished, building on the foundation of the grandmaster Edgar Rice Burroughs.",John Carter
626,schmev117,"A disappointing, yet still enjoyable, experience",6,11 March 2012,"There are a few spoilers in this review, but don't worry, it won't be anything major.I wanted to love John Carter, I really did, but sadly I ended up only loving small parts of it. With Andrew Stanton (Oscar winning director and writer of classics like Finding Nemo and Wall*e) at the helm , and the film being an adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' beloved class ""A Princess of Mars,"" I thought this picture could do no wrong. As it turns out, this film ended up being very disappointing.The biggest problem with the movie is that the basic storyline is far too boring. Only a few ounces of suspense are produced and the entire middle third of the film sags heavily with only a couple standout moments. There are in fact, several scenes that are almost completely unnecessary and only make the film feel more cumbersome. Ironically, one of of those relatively unnecessary scenes ends up being my favorite, and in my opinion, the best part of the entire film.This scene involves John Carter (and his little, alien-dog-friend who I will get to later) fighting off an entire legion of enemies called the ""Warhoon"" in order to give Dejah Thoris and a ""Thark"" (9 foot tall, green, 4 armed, and barbaric inhabitants of Mars) named Sola the time to escape. During this battle scene, there several cutaways to brief clips that give us an insight into Carter's depressing past. This scene is made incredibly well made and when it cuts from Carter killing these ""Warhoon"" by the dozen to him burying his wife and child, you'd have to be pretty cold-hearted not to feel at least a little emotion. This sequence also gives us a chance to see how bad-ass John Carter really is.The film also has too much cheesy dialogue. Some of the things the characters say are just a little too unnatural, while some of the lines are just plain cringe-worthy. Other films reminiscent of John Carter such as Star Wars and Avatar (two better films which are actually heavily inspired by ""A Princess of Mars"" ) also have the same problem, but those films had many great aspects to them while this film only has a few.In terms of villainy, it is hard to get more boring than the ones in John Carter. The two main villains, a Thern (seemingly all-powerful, shape shifting, priest-like characters who feed off destruction) named Matai Shang (Strong) and a Zodangan (a warlike race which is sucking Mars' resources dry) King called Sab Than (West,) are very underdeveloped, but this actually turns out to be a good thing because they are so severely uninteresting. They use this weapon called the ""9th Ray"" which is pretty much a blue light that allows them to destroy everything they want. This weapon doesn't make for anything threatening and it ends up relying on the only visual effect in the movie that doesn't look fantastic.I thought that for the most part, the acting ranged from decent to good. Taylor Kitsch is fine in the title role, but nothing more. I felt as if they could have found someone who a looked a little more masculine for the part but that is my only real gripe. Lynn Collins is extremely beautiful and charming as Dejah Thoris but doesn't have enough to do. Willem Dafoe (acting using CGI/Motion Capture) is always great and it is no different here as the Jeddak, Tars Tarkas (""Jeddak"" means king), who is having trouble suppressing his compassion in a barbaric society that doesn't allow emotion. While the villains are uninteresting, they are still played reasonably well by Mark Strong (who is now typecast in the arrogant ""bad-guy"" role) and Dominic West.By far the best thing about this film is the visuals. This film is absolutely epic in scope while featuring phenomenal CGI with some great cinematography that captures the beautiful landscape of ""Barsoom."" The aforementioned battle sequence with the ""Warhoon"" is among the best action scenes I've seen in a long time, in fact, it's one of my all-around favorite parts of any movie I've seen over the past few years. There is also the thrilling action scene that was heavily exploited in the promotion of the film, the ""Great White Ape"" sequence. This sequence ends with a surprisingly gory and just plain awesome moment that left me with a huge smile on my face. In terms of motion capture, the film is brilliant. The Tharks ended up being some of my favorite characters in the movie and they were done entirely with the technology. I actually found that almost all the scenes with the Tharks were easily the most entertaining sections of the film, and the scenes with the human-like characters were by far the most boring.What's funny is that the most compelling and entertaining character is one who has no dialogue; it's Woola, the alien-dog I mentioned above. His extreme loyalty to John Carter, his playfulness, and his ability to run 250 miles per hour, make him hilarious and actually pretty awesome when he gets into battle.Michael Giacchino is one of the best composers working today and it is no surprise that he created an absolutely wonderful musical score for this movie. It just feels so adventurous and sweeping. It was hard for me to stop humming the main theme after walking out of the theater.I also loved the ending of this film. It is really unique and unravels in an unexpected way that is interesting and left me wanting a little more.Even though I was disappointed by John Carter, I still enjoyed it and will definitely see it again. It was a movie that had some great visuals, with decent characters and humor, but is weighed down heavily by cheesy dialogue, uninteresting villains and a boring plot.",John Carter
627,guyasphalt-853-739062,EPIC Must See Movie,10,9 March 2012,"I just returned from seeing John Carter on Imax 3-D. I rarely write reviews but this is a must see movie. I compare it to a combination of ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"". Great special effects! Knowing that much of the film was created in a studio it still has the epic proportions of a ""Ten Commandments"" I did not read the book(s) so I can not tell you if they follow the story line accurately. Their are some strong messages and symbolism however don't look for a deep plot. It is't that type of movie.I am so amazed at this production that I need to digest it all before I tell you more...",John Carter
628,scottwilkins,"Relax, then go see.",10,26 March 2012,"I found this movie to be much better than I expected. I think the main reason anyone would rate it lower is that it's not quite the run-and-gun flick that the commercials and trialers make you think it would be. It is a long movie, well over 2 hours. And it does take a bit at the beginning to get moving. But, at the end I'm not sure I wouldn't have liked a 3 hour movie with a bit more detail.It's slow sorta of like Dune. But as the movie unfolds, it gains speed. A lot of speed. The actors and actresses are all engaging and well played. And the story is held much closer to the books that I had imagined it would be, adding just enough to make a more believable movie experience.If you are a ""Type-A"" personality, you may not like this movie, as it is slow at first. But anyone who likes an engaging story with just the right amount of real depth and detail, this is your movie.",John Carter

John Carter is genuinely new story for us. We would like to see More. 3) We like to know belowa) What happens next?b) They will visit Earth?c) will story goes into future Earth?d) When John returns to Mars does he reach the same time line or time will skip.

630,bmhill-23-403272,Why the Cliffhanger Ending?,5,18 March 2012,"John Carter could have been and should have been a self contained movie, with no cliffhanger ending. But the film makers just couldn't help themselves and felt they need to leave the audience wanting more. Well, guess what? Due to a lackluster box office there isn't going to be anymore, and due to a dissatisfying ending I am unlikely to buy this movie on Blu-ray.Just because Back to the Future ended on a cliffhanger and Fellowship of the Ring didn't have a satisfying ending, doesn't mean that John Carter should follow suit. You should have left the audience with the happy ending and introduce John Carter's Crypt at the start of a (proposed) second movie (if one ever gets made). Introducing the crypt would have been a great way to start a second movie.John Carter was a classic sci-fi fantasy tale just like the original Star Wars. Sure, Star Wars could of have shown a fleet of Star Destroyers searching for the rebels at the end, but the thrown room celebration was a much more appropriate and satisfying place to end. There are numerous other examples of this same kind of story, including Avatar and Flash Gordon (1980). These films have story that have satisfying endings while leaving some threads that lead to (potential) follow up movie, but they didn't actually show the first act of the next story, which is what John Carter did. There is a reason why movies don't do this.Showing the first act of the next story is what writers do on TV shows, particularly pilot episodes, to get people to come back for a second episode, it's also something that is done for season finales, give them a cliffhanger ending. It's a cheap way to hold on to your audience, instead of giving them a quality show to watch, which is a better reason for them to come back. John Carter was a good movie that didn't need a cliffhanger ending and was weakened by it's draw out cliffhanger.To film makes everywhere, audiences hate unresolved cliffhanger endings. Unless you know for sure you are going to make a second movie, don't give us a cliffhanger ending (the same goes for TV shows).",John Carter
631,MadLynix,Good Entertaining Movie!,9,21 March 2012,"I enjoyed this movie! It is entertaining and has everything from imagination, visual effects, romantic plot, fighting, etc etc.. One should not compare this to a more serious movie like Troy but appreciate in the method it was done and after all we want to be entertained and enjoy the time spent.. This movie will do the job! I recommend that you go see it and judge for yourself! I don't like why negative statements were released by Disney managers or producers in regards to achieving $200M, they should realize that does impact an ongoing release which I think it can meet its budget especially counting international sales and later Blue-Ray, DVDs etc.. Anyways you will see many positive feedback on this movie once you go through the reviews..",John Carter
632,deerejohn999,Absolutely Spectacular,10,13 March 2012,"I was a little skeptical about another Hollywood adaptation of a classic book, but this movie proved my wrong. It makes Avatar look like an Ed Wood movie! There is a perfect mix of visual wonder, great action scenes, very good acting, and a little infusion of humour in the right places. This is one of those movies that you can sit through several times and still feel awe at the action on the screen. What a delight to watch a movie with no dead spots to suffer through or heavy handed political messages (Avatar). This could be one of the top ten movies of the year despite a bit of a lukewarm reception by the ""critics"". Call the babysitter and go have yourself a wonderful experience!",John Carter
633,Surferdude5269,"Huge Fan of the books, movie wasn't terrible..but disappointing",5,10 March 2012,"I really really wanted to like John Carter. I really did. I love Andrew Staunton, the cast, the books...but the movie was just...not very good. First, the script was really pretty bad. There was absolutely no sense of rhythm or pace. The writers bit off way more than they could chew and tried to throw so much of the 2nd and 3rd book into the first, that they forgot to develop characters and build tension. There's so much important information that is lacking from the story, and unnecessary information being thrown at you, that even I had trouble following it (and I, theoretically, know what happens). They also added a bunch of extra things to the story (particularly in the way Carter travels between the planets) which, in my opinion, made the story line less interesting and more corny than what Burroughs had written. Rather than focusing on creating memorable characters (Tars Tarkas, Sola, and Kantos Kan might as well be footnotes) and elaborating on the the different cultures and belief systems that shape the world of Barsoom, the movie focuses on action scenes and a story line which doesn't occur until deep into the second book. Without Burrough's exquisitely shaped and extensive ground-work, there is little to no reason to care about a lot of what's going on. It's as if Yoda showed up and you knew that Darth Vadar was Luke's Father mid-way through New Hope. Why would you care? The filmmakers missed a huge opportunity to show the extremely inventive and thought-provoking ways in which Carter adapts to and changes his new home, and as a result, they also really missed a lot of the cultural commentary in the book. This movie had everything going for it (especially with a 250 million dollar budget), and what's really disappointing is that some of the shots and lot of the character designs (besides ALL of the red people) look really good. There are moments of greatness in there (like the ending), but they are very few and far between. I almost walked out half way through, and I've never walked out of a movie before (especially one I was this excited about). IN CONCLUSION: Read the books, they are mind-blowing, beautiful, and way more interesting. This movie was just OK...at its best, and at its worst...confusing, cheesy, and banal.",John Carter
634,McFlyster,Read the Books!,8,11 August 2012,"If it was not for this movie, I would not have been intrigued or motivated to seek out and read the ERB books that it is based on. I loved the movie and was thoroughly surprised to see that there were not a lot of changes incorporated when they adapted it from the books. For this I say ""Job well done, Disney!"". The books were fantastic and one could even say that even Superman could have been based on ERB's stories. Back to the movie, Although I strongly feel that Disney did not market this film in the right way, the film itself is Sci-Fi at its best. Since this is a delayed submission, I will just say that I will be going out today to purchase John Carter and add it to my collection, which, only contains films that are worthy of being added to the ""library"".",John Carter
635,saurabhsinha-bits,Really tiring and clichéd,1,13 March 2012,"I had taken a day off from work and wanted to just chill out. Unfortunately, I chose john Carter to start the day. As it turned out to be painfully ludicrous, I walked of this movie while 15-20 minutes were still left. Yes, It's the first movie ever I've walked out off in my lifetime. Loads of over-acting('My name is carter, john carter' in a stylized coarse voice), a plot that makes no sense, scripts and characters derived from various other movies like avatar, etc. and a scantily clad 'princess' who doesn't know how to act and is not even attractive make this movie dreadfully clichéd. A counter-argument for a possible argument - Even the kids were getting restless. Some of them even walked out. It is quite disappointing that Stanton being so talented made such an obvious dud. Maybe, he should limit himself to what he's best at - animation movies. TLDR: Avoid this movie.",John Carter

It was well acted. My fiancé and I enjoyed it immensely. We go to the movies every weekend and I would rate this in the top 3 we've seen this year. If you want a good time, go see it. It's definitely worth it. Yes, Disney spent 250 million on this movie. You can tell how much work went into it. I really hope it makes enough to do the sequels.

If they'd done a better job, maybe they wouldn't have lost so much money on this film due to lack of box office success.John Carter is a FANTASTIC film. The writing is great, the cast is greater, and the visuals match the tone of the film perfectly. Where else do you see a crossover between the Civil War era and the fantastical realm of other planets? Woven throughout these attributes is an air of mystery and intrigue that left me wanting more of this universe.What a shame.",John Carter

First saw it during Xmas 2012, and it really left me with a dreamy feeling - of course Sci-Fi with space travel, Mars and all that, but also about love and separation, lots of action, strange fantasy creatures, overcoming inner resistance, loyalty and family values, being an outcast, power and politics, very nice scenery, even some comedy, and then......this is not a story copied from or inspired by Star Wars, Avatar and the like, I've later learned it's based on novels 100 years old and could be said being an early inspiration and original for most modern Sci-Fi adventure stories...So, I'll now get the Blu-Ray disc after seeing the movie three times on cable as it every time have left me with that dreamy feeling of lost love and to what length man (and woman) can go to salvage it.Also: *especially like the princess very blue eyes*",John Carter

I have always been into all kinds of film and don't have a preference, so I watched the movie with an open mind and no expectations. After seeing this vivid and action packed movie about another planet, I was amazed at the lack of publicity Disney gave it. Unlike AVATAR'S on going hype, I heard nothing about the details of the movie, it's making and it's story. But after seeing it I recommend it to any one. With the lack of publicity Disney gave it, I am not sure how they are going to make back 250 Million dollars, but I guess they are hoping that word of mouth will get around and bring people to see it. So if you are into fantasy, scifi and action films... go see it! It was wonderful.",John Carter
641,danielsimon,Mars bound for John Carter.,6,8 March 2012,"So i walked into this film not knowing anything about it, only by what i saw in the trailer (which like others have said gives you nothing to go on.) I sat in the theater as the opening happened and thought ""what have i walked into"". I thought it was going to be really dull and lifeless. From the start you get that western fell to it...not so much dull like Cowboys & Aliens. You get that John has a past as he is always reckless and doesn't give much to anything but himself. The story is pretty plain until John finally gets to Mars...and that when the movie really turned around for me.From here on in the movie its just plain fun adventure. Kind of like when you are watching Indiana Jones. Some parts of the movie you sit and fell like its going for to long but then it picks up and something else is happening. I agree when people say that they feel they tried to cram so much into a 2Hr movie which they might have but if you think about it, you will notice a bit of plot holes.The acting in the film isn't anything we haven't seen before. Lynn Collins does an alright job. At first i didn't think much of her but as she progressed on screen i started to see her differently - a princess confident to stop the fall of her hometown. Taylor Kitsch does an OK job, i feel like some of the dialogue wasn't the best and feel like he could of had more emotions in scenes then just yelling or being pretty placid.At the end of the movie i felt like i went to a little adventure on Mars myself. I felt happy with what i saw. Most people will walk out with ""Been there, seen that"". But with a little research you will find out that the movie is based on a book by Edgar Rice Burroughs "" A Princess of Mars"" that was written in 1912. With that you find out that it brought inspiration to Sci-Fi movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones.Overall if you want to see a visually stunning movie and a classic adventure then John Carter will be for you. If not then i would avoid seeing it.",John Carter
642,sarkaramrit2,Not As Good As It Seems! !,4,12 March 2012,"I watched the Trailer of the movie and went to the Screen with high hopes and aspirations. It started off very calmly, it started to pick up before I realize it is gonna be a similar tale like 'Avatar'. As the movie progress, the humor and the story pace seem to be attractive and it actually was worth praising. But I was disappointed with the actors cast in the movie and most importantly with John Carter. He looked like a TV series' actor and didn't express like a warrior's accent. Thanks to an excellent direction which somehow hid it but was clearly understandable. The other Star cast were so so but the Alien creatures stole the show. The pet Carter had was similar to a Dog in earth and all other Basoom's residents like the villagers of a place which no longer belongs to them. So the story was not so unique or something other than they added up Mars with it. But still It is worth a Ticket to show at Screens. special effects and action were all and all original and mesmerizing. So I would suggest to step out from house at Weekend with your pals and have a good experience about the Disney's Hero.",John Carter
643,vforciniti,Nothing new...,6,23 March 2012,"The basic Idea behind the movie is not bad. This Captain from Virginia is sent, somehow, on Mars (Barsoom in the Martian naming). He tries to go back on Earth (Jarsoom in the Martian naming) but, during his journey on the planet, he's able to stop the war that was going on for years... John Carter acquires special abilities on Mars, due to the different gravity of the planet. He's able to perform huge jumps and he's stronger than the local population. He meets a princess and they fall in love, but she has to marry the bad guy. He's in a strange relationship with the Martian population of the Tharks, he becomes one of them (it remembers me Avatar) and drives them to the final battle in order to bring peace to Barsoom. In other words, it is an already seen plot. Special effects are not at very top level (in certain scenes it looks like the 4 handed race, the Tharks, are moving using stop motion and they look like plastic beings). In my honest opinion the movie is not that bad to see, but if you expect something really new I guess you need to watch another movie. If you feel comfortable with this kind of movie, you can easily enjoy it.",John Carter

The acting was terrible in many places except for the action hero Taylor Kitsch, who managed to bring the role to life. Thespian Dominic West, of The Wire fame, was particularly bad and seems to have done nothing to convince anyone he can go beyond what he achieved in that excellent Baltimore series. As for Lynn Collins, she was the nail in the coffin. But it wasn't just that, the visuals in the film (and i know i may be going against the grain here) were unimpressive while the story line read like Cameron had been involved at some stage.

The action scenes are nice, the way Barssom is imagined is pretty coherent and beautiful, I personally found the protagonists convincing and didn:t mind the changes bought to them.
I've been a fan of the Carter novels for a long time and I was as happy with the movie when I saw it at the theatre in 2012, as I'm with it now, rewatching it in May 2020.

646,lessesk,Surprisingly good,8,12 March 2012,"I saw John Carter last night in 3D and for once I was pleasantly surprised. In short this movie suffers from bad marketing as opposed to the norm which is normally bad movies marketed really well. Is the film 'great'? Not really but what it is, is another solid Science fiction film with some depth and not just action. There are some really good story telling elements and I have to say there were some moments I didn't pick and that was refreshing as well. The story did travel quite nicely, except for the start where they tried to ramp up the gears to get the audience engaged, but that's OK. Some of the highlights for me were:* Unknown lead did a pretty good job and didn't come across lame at all. He was believable as a character and his unusual behaviour at the start is explained through short bursts of memory which were blended into the film nicely. * Alien natives weren't stupid. Thank god they didn't go the Jaja binks route and make all aliens stupid/funny and treat humans as the saviours of the world. The natives on this planet have an established culture, fearless but also have a caring side. They have wicked looking sniper rifles and are pretty good fighters. They also generate some funny moments but not at the expense of themselves. * Leading on from the aliens, the princess of one of the human looking races is a scientist and early on you get to see her in action with a sword. She is a strong character with brains and can hold her own in a fight. So happy they didn't dumb her down as well. Good to see a girl with brains, and also hot. * Scenery and visual affects in 3D. Wow is the word. I have seen a lot of films in 3D and I always came away wishing I saw it in 2D. This film was obviously shot for 3D and its very smooth and every scene utilizes 3D really well. The natives were unbelievable quality and are done so well you don't think of them as animation or rendered. * There is a nice twist at the end of the film and almost has a Sherlock Holmes feel to it. It actually made me care for the character and I was keen to see where the story went. Considering the crowds I saw at films like Phantom Menace, Transformers etc etc. Its a real shame that this film may go under the radar for a lot of hardcore sci-fi fans, especially when its so visually stunning in 3D. You know a film is working when the audience as a whole laugh at the same spots and 'ooooohhhh' at the big battle scenes. At the end of the film my cousin who I saw the film with, told me he was really surprised at how much he liked it and it was obvious why it costs so much money. Judging from the comments around us you could tell it was received well. Its funny how some films have so much hype and end up fizzing out. This is one film that seems to have no hype and may fizzle out before its given a chance, shame since its a solid title and a lot of people will be gutted that they didn't see it on the big screen.Summarising I am going to recommend this to all my mates who love sci-fi and if someone asked me to see it with them I would probably go again. I guess the best compliment I can give this film is that I was thinking about it the next day. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",John Carter
647,fayettecountypublicdefen,"John Carter, Warlord of Mars",9,12 March 2012,"Just saw this film, and could hardly wait to review it. IGNORE THE CRITICS! This is far and away the best adventure movie to appear since the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which collectively are its only peers of the last twenty years. Disney's previews do not do it justice. If you are a fan of action films in general, and of swashbucklers in particular, go see this film. TWICE! Disney's ham-handed treatment of its publicity may strangle a potential blockbuster series in its crib, so check it out. The general feel is loyal to Edgar Rice Burroughs ""Mars"" series, but not slavishly so. While there is some violence, there's nothing your average 12 year old couldn't handle, so its ""family friendly"" enough for the Disney brand and its PG 13 rating. Both my wife and daughter were favorably impressed as well, so check it out while you can.",John Carter
648,hallmarc20,Fantastic Movie!!!,10,17 March 2012,"I love SCIFI/Fantasy movies, and this movie just might be the best movie I have seen. Before I saw this movie, Avatar was one of my favorites, but now I believe this movie beats it. It left me hoping for a sequel. The acting was sublime and the plot kept my full attention through the entire movie. Not to mention the woman playing as the princess was probably the most beautiful woman I ever saw. Lynn Collins in her costume beats princess Leia and then some! I rarely even take the time to write a review for a movie but with such a performance, I could not resist. This movie is a MUST see for all fantasy lovers!! It was worth every penny I paid to see it!",John Carter

Folks enjoyed it, laughing in the right places and so forth.My first view was eight days ago in 2D, and this was 3D. Personally, it was measurably clearer to me, visually. Carter and Tars, for instance, didn't get lost in the crowded scenes. Also, the long shots of landscapes? By Jove! There were Thoats and riders 'way down there, moving through the scenery!! Even the more closely-framed scenes worked better for me in 3D.This was my first modern-era 3D movie experience, and I was expecting to be rather disappointed, based on what I had read on an ERB list. But it worked so much BETTER for me than 2D! Who woulda thunk it? Anyway, also, overall, I ""got"" more in general the second time too, as there is a lot going on both on- and off-camera. Enjoyed both script-wise and acting-wise. It is not the exact book, but I think it's pretty wonderful, frankly. Carpers may carp, but IMHO this is far beyond what any ERB fan could have expected in the real world - and I mean that in a good way.Sequel coming or not, it's a winner of a flick.So there.",John Carter
650,luke-321-35,"John Carter - Not great, not bad.",6,19 March 2012,"For me a film has to have memorable moments and thinking back.. this film has none of these- there is no reason to re-visit this title at all. The creatures look good, the CGI in general looks great but this doesn't go a long way to improve the overall movie experience. It is an average film, no more, no less.The lead Taylor Kitsch saves the film somewhat. This could springboard him into many other big films in future. There was some very sketchy dialogue which he pulled off convincingly well. He has great screen presence which was utilised well. The supporting actors did a satisfactory job, the voice actors seemingly doing a better job than the live actors.Emotionally, the film missed the mark for me. Even with the 'Lost-esque' soundtrack I found myself being very emotionally detached from the film and not caring what happens to any of the characters.The overall look of the film, the Mars location, the aliens.. they all look good. It does look like another planet. Job well done in that respect. Where it falls down is the story- nothing out of this world there. I was expecting something epic, it fell short of my expectations.",John Carter
651,joshuapennypacker,Epic Film,10,21 March 2012,"Several weeks ago I saw a trailer for a science fiction flic called John Carter. All that was shown was a virtually unknown cast(which I love when done right), a pretty red -skinned girl that was obviously wearing a ton of make-up on that wasn't explained, a man throwing people around as if they were light as a feather, some flying ships, something about Mars, and some green skinned aliens with 4 arms. The movie that was depicted in this $250 million budgeted blockbuster's trailer was that of something you go out of your way to avoid and dislike without ever giving it a try, or seeing it.The fact is, this movie is nothing like the badly put together trailers for it. You are on the edge of your seat the entire time being fed little by little an amazing journey with a storyline, plot, universe, and characters to not just rival Avatar, but to top it. You are drawn in through a historical yet science fiction 19th century atmosphere that has you questioning if your in the right movie or not. The flashbacks and pre-setups that take place from everything to the current timeline of the story to the main characters previous family keep you interested, intrigued, and not able to predict some linear obvious plot like today's movies normally do. The main storyline continues to entice all the way through till what seems to be an ending to the main plot and a temporary but happy ending to the romantic subplot.Romance, no matter how many people try to deny it, makes or brakes a movie. The cast involved, the emotional levels, the depth or lack of depth involved, the accurate gestures, the dialogue, etc. lays the foundation for the plot. John Carter's romance provides a perfect mixture of mystery, fueds, drama, and just the right amount of screen time to make the actual plot believable and interactive.Being a part of the technological generation that has strayed away from reading and more towards social networking, television, and movies is almost a curse. I had never heard of the amazing book franchise that sparked this motion pictures creation and funded the breathtaking world that is John Carter. I intend to read the first books I haven't had to read for college in the next couple months, and they will be the novels that inspired John Carter.John Carter deserves more than just a sequel, and I believe 90% of the science fiction fans who have actually seen the movie and not the trailers or negative reviews know this. Nothing else can be said besides the marketing FAIL on behalf of Disney or if the director really was solo'ly responsible for the advertisement. Anyone with a brain can tell there a significant market for science fiction in this messed up world we live in with a disappearing middle class and a growing instability in governments. Disney would be out of their minds to not introduce a new commercial or last minute advertisement campaign and attempt to gain a larger gross from the weeks John Carter still has in theatres and the DVD release.10/10 and replaces Avatar in my mind as the most interesting fantasy universe I have yet to come across and would like more of. I will continue to spread the word of what a real movie should look like, like John Carter.",John Carter
652,GazeRock,A typical guilty pleasure movie...,7,31 March 2012,"This movie is a festive gathering of cheesiness and clichés. Storywise, there is absolutely nothing that we haven't seen before. You have the typical main character; a brave warrior, who fears nothing, and goes beyond any realistic standard of manliness. A princess, who has to get married to a villain against her own will. Epic battles against alien creatures. A loyal but goofy looking animal companion, following our hero around. It's honestly one cliché after another. But let's be honest; everyone enjoys a good cliché film from time to time! For me, this was one of those films!The acting isn't anything special, and I shall admit; at the beginning of the movie, it had me quite annoyed at times. But once I had gotten used to the at best mediocre way of acting, I realized it was actually perfect to portray the cheesy storyline, and it actually gave a certain kind of charm to this film.The graphics though, those were very well done! I loved the sceneries, and even though the creature design wasn't groundbreaking by any means, it was still brilliantly done. The costume design was very typical, and exactly what you'd expect from a movie like this. But with the cheesy storyline the film has, you wouldn't want to have it any other way!While watching this film, I actually felt quite embarrassed, because all in all, I probably shouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did. But I guess that's what a guilty pleasure movie is all about. When it comes to a cliché film; this film is one of the most entertaining, and visually satisfying that I've seen in a long time! So if you're able to enjoy a good cheesy storyline sci-fi that makes you feel like a total dork for two hours, then this is a must see for you!",John Carter
653,bob_bageera,Fantastic movie,10,11 March 2012,"I have not seen more than half a dozen movies total I consider better than this one. This is very high praise. I truly do not see how they could possibly have done anything better without Taylor having undergone swordsmanship, as opposed to fencing, lessons for a year or so. Think how much better Ahnuld's swordsmanship was in Red Sonja than the awkward moves in the first Conan movie. I was pleasantly surprised with the female lead having seen her in other movies. The woman cleaned up real real good! The one change in the plot, and I think there should be a nod of thanks to L.E. Modesitt, was an actual improvement. I will say the less revealing costumes than those described by ERB are probably more apropos for this prissy generation. I did think that it might have been a spot truer to the original opening, but that would have left a friend of John Carter hanging. I completely loved what they did with Woolla though a somewhat slenderer and less comic critter has inhabited my psyche for the past 5 decades.",John Carter

The sets and the CGI do a good job at helping you feel like you are in another world. The scenes and cast in the 19th century all work very well together, mostly for comedic effect but also dramatically.The Bad News: The plot was rushed. They had enough story for three movies here and they crammed it all into 90 minutes. I haven't read the books but I imagine that more than one was used to make this movie. This took its toll on the actors. The romantic leads had no chemistry and their acting was usually wooden or over the top. There was a wealth of acting talent in the supporting cast that was mostly squandered. The makers of this movie seemed to want to take the same approach as the people who made ""Transformers"" and ""Battle Ship"": make a lemon. It looks really pretty on the outside (sets, locations, special effects, pretty actors, etc.) but it has almost no substance (dialogue, acting, story pacing, etc.).I'm glad we only paid four dollars to see this show.",John Carter

Great story, great effects, bidden me on chair from the beginning to the end.",John Carter
657,seekndestroy,Pure and Classical in Its Approach,8,11 June 2012,"When Willem Dafoe said in an interview that John Carter was ""pure in its approach, classical and not hip or cool"", I really wanted to just throw my hands up and offer him everything I have in exchange for his mind, because I agree a 100%, and before writing this review or reading Dafoe's interview I could never find the words to defend this movie I adore so much from the throes of mindless, tasteless haters out there. Modern cinema NEEDS the kind of approach Andrew Stanton brings to Sci Fi movies. These days, production companies make it almost a prerequisite for Sci Fi/Fantasy movies not to dwell too deeply into its hard roots. Makes it difficult for mainstream audiences to connect to, you see. But with all that, most Sci Fi/Fantasy has over the years lost its individuality, spark and everything that makes it special. John Carter had that ""spark"" a lot of other so-called Sci Fi/Fantasy movies didn't have. And I feel that John Carter really brings modern Sci Fi back to its roots. Maybe not so much in a big scale, but it's definitely one of the first few steps to bringing back true Sci Fi/Fantasy movie flicks, instead of all that blockbuster soft science crap we get these days.What a thrill ride! It really leaves your mouth gaping and your eyes popping from hit after hit of what a stunning picture it is! Everything from the not-sorry-to-be-corny dialogue to the mindless heroism to the barbaric brutality of the natives to the alluring aura of the princess... it's all very Sci Fi. This is the kind of movie only a true Sci Fi devotee like Stanton could make. I seriously can't believe all the sh*t Sci Fi we have to watch these days and all the money it makes. But if you look at this positively, maybe it's a good thing this movie didn't make any money. That way it's poised to be a cult classic, and while hailed as a great movie, would never get corrupted by the influx of mainstream over-attention. Also, it's probably a good thing Stanton left Disney. He probably did it out of protest.",John Carter

Awesome special effects, action, romance, unique story, and cool, interesting characters. Great themes of love, loss, power, sacrifice, friendship, and perseverance. Did not know Burroughs wrote sci-fi and was a pioneer ahead of his time paving the way for sci-fi stories and films we love today. See more about background and how film came to be on DVD.

But unlike Tarzan this is science fiction. If you liked Star Wars, if you liked Willow, if you like adventure and action movies then check this one out.

Yes it was very wild and unrealistic, but it was very imaginative and fun to watch. I gave it a 7/10 and you will probably either really like it, or hate it. I actually really liked the action scenes in this movie and thought the plot was actually not to bad. I also like Taylor Kitsch as an actor, and even though Battleship wasn't a great movie, I still liked him in it, and would like to see him in some more movies.

That's what it was a lovely, fun adventure film. I did not even know at the time about the grand legacy of the writer of the book, behind the film, OK so i am told it differs somewhat from ERB's book but now having gone and got into the books, i have no issue with that, i guess it's harder as it often is, if you do it the other way round.I was surprised to discover how few of my like minded friends who like a good science fantasy had heard of this film, after recommendation many of us agreed, it's a great film, that has the potential to be part of a great series, Rice Burrough's books are more than deserving of adaptation, though sadly that may never happen due to the appalling marketing and promotion on this film. It may of been a box office flop due to reasons beyond the actual film itself, but remember, many box office flops have gone on to become legendary and the failure is not down to the film itself. The film now has an adoring cult following who are now petitioning on facebook and conventions, for the films sequel and i wish them every luck and i for one would like to see the return of Stanton as writer, I loved Monsters inc and John Carter and happen to think he's a genius.",John Carter
665,eelalien,WAY better than expected!!,8,12 August 2012,"We finally got around to watching this film on cable on-demand, and it was an excellent, surprisingly good experience! We avoided it because from the previews like nothing more than a super-charged stereotypical blockbuster action flick. Well - WRONG! It is a very intelligently scripted adaptation of an Edgar Rice Burroughs book from almost a decade ago. The special effects/CGI aspects are very tastefully done, and not over-used as in many similar films. There were definite Disney touches, as well, including the lovable dog- like creature and the overall princess-vs.-evil-suitor plot. We were worried that this film might be just too battle-laden to be a fun watch for our 9-yr. old daughter, but it was fine storytelling at its core. Truly a pity that it bombed in the theatres, but I would definitely lay a heap of blame on the marketing of this Disney flick - the trailers did it no justice whatsoever, and missed promoting the great story behind the appropriate action segments.

669,fotini188,Confusing storytelling,5,7 February 2020,"Are you expecting to see John Carter as Conan in space as described by Edgar Rice Burrows in Princess of Mars? That's not going to happen because the creators of this movie decided to merge almost three books of storytelling into 2 hours of a movie and of course it doesn't work. A lot of elements and storylines are kept similar but they are mixed up appearing in different order or without explanation making them veeery confusing. The imagery and graphics are decent but due to the confusion they have no emotional impact on the viewer.
On another point, why does everyone call him Virginia? The writers might have thought this is a funny prop but in the book Carter spends time learning the language and understanding their customs, with this being explained in the movie with some kind of magic potion.
I would recommend skipping the first ~10-15 minutes of confusing exposition and starting from where the book starts by focusing on John Carter's viewpoint.
A major problem of this movie is that women are devoid of initiative and character, a fact that was quite progressive in Burrow's book. Both Sola and Deja are side characters with their motivation not being explained e.g. Sola's storyline and her mother's story which formed her character and explains her kind disposition diferentiating her from other Martians. Don't even start me on Deja...or even Mark Strong's pointless vilain character which doesn't connect with any other character or make any sense, especially to viewers who are not familiar with the Barsoom series.
Overall an entertaining and confusing movie that could have been great!",John Carter

I'm sure if LOTR had the same budget & was forced to tell the whole story in just one movie the critics would have the same criticisms that they apply to this movie. If it came out today I'd definitely say it's worth the price of admission, being that it's only a few bucks or even free on streaming services there's no reason not to pick it for your family movie night. You won't be disappointed!",John Carter
671,normantray,A personal masterpiece,10,31 January 2016,"I had a complicated relationship with John Carter. I've been a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs' A Princess of Mars (or ""La princesse de Mars"" in France) since I was 17. The first time I saw the movie, I hated the guts of it. It was just too different from the movie I had in mind when reading what I consider perfect books. Then a strange things happened, my opinion slowly but surely shifted 180 degrees. Now it's my favorite movie. All things considered, it was kind of a mourning process, and seeing what the movie did right instead of what it did wrong. And what it did right was nothing short of amazing.John Carter is a delightful straightforward movie, that never winks at its audience, and old-fashioned yet modern take at the same time on an ageless story. The heroic John Carter of the books is here, just buried under an added layer of damaged past. Dejah Thoris has almost as strong a character as her literary counterpart (yes, almost), but with a less passive role overall. Woola is perfect. Everybody loves Woola. Tars Tarkas and Sola are not just CG wonders, they have actual characters. James Purefoy is perfect, and it was great to see him play once again the henchman of Ciaran Hinds as in the Rome TV show.And that ending. It's been next to four years since release, and I still badly want to see the sequels. I don't care if it's cheap live-action, animated, or made with sock puppets, I want to see them. I want Andrew Stanton, maybe the guy most passionate about storytelling on this very Earth, finish what he begun so magnificently. We NEED the punchline.Disney let down its own movie by performing the most dreadful marketing ever attempted on a big budget movie. I don't care who was responsible, but the facts are the facts. People to this day are still discovering and loving the movie. The audience is there, and Disney owes us one. Will the Mouse have the guts to proceed with another one?

It felt like it had more depth and more of a story telling arc than is usual for action adventure films in my experience.John Carter is a likable hero and Taylor Kitsch is a really great choice in the role, he seems to portray the pain in his life in a very believable way. It also doesn't hurt that he's really easy on the eye, lol.But all the actors seem right for their roles, Lynne Collins is really good as the feisty, intelligent heroine, Mark Strong is always solid as the baddie and Dominic West is really good as the megalomaniac wanting to rule Mars.This film was so good for me because it was just not a bunch of action sequences flimsily held together by a bit of a plot, but actually took the time and the patience to tell a story. The 3D also wasn't just a load of things flying out of the screen to make you jump, it just gave the film more of a depth.If you're not the usual action/adventure geek, go and see this film, you'll be in for a really pleasant surprise.

It's one of those movies that is meant for the big screen -- great action, sweeping visuals -- give it a ride and you won't be disappointed.I wasn't sure what to expect the first time I saw it as the poor box office showing and mediocre reviews had me wondering. I left ready to see it again to pick up all the little bits that I knew I missed. I was completely entertained, and never noticed the time. I was surprised at how often I found myself laughing and chuckling at the bits of humor weaved throughout the story. The actors did a terrific job of bringing the story to life; I found myself really wanting John Carter to win the war and the girl (and the girl to win John Carter). The screenplay was another success. The movie doesn't follow the book(s), but ties multiple elements from the series together in a way that is fluid and is in someways more more approachable than the originals.One personal preference note: skip the 3-D. As with every other 3D film I've seen, the technology is more a nuisance than a pleasure. I went back to see the film in 2D over lunch and enjoyed it far more. The 3-D effect is again more like multiple layers of 2D, and the glasses just limit your field of view. If this were a film of tight dialog on two people maybe, but with all the stunning visuals, you really limit yourself behind those silly glasses (or you find yourself moving your head around to take it all in).I'll probably pick up the blu-ray, but even on a large television, the experience won't be the same (well, unless you have a 900"" television). I hope this movie picks up, because I'd love to see what they do with a sequel. The last time I went to see a film twice while at the theater was... never. I usually just wait for the disc.

681,CaptBecks,Disney Y U NO follow through?,10,27 April 2012,"Disney did a horrible job at marketing this, which must be the only reason contributing to its $200 million loss because this movie is fantastic. A better title, better branding, and the amazing marketing that Disney is known for would have made this movie a blockbuster. Why they just made it and put it out there without much thought, I'll never understand. It has all the elements to make a serial empire, or at least a trilogy. This movie is capable of sequels, spin-off TV show, games, and toys galore. What gives, Disney? Why make such a beautiful child and then leave int in the street to die?Forget the numbers, go see this movie. It is cinematically up to Disney standards and is a great sci-fi flick that will please all sorts of people. There's action, romance, and more.This is going to end up being one of those underrated gems like Firefly or Newsies. Too bad, because I would have liked to see an animated series based on this.",John Carter
682,alexfragedakis,Fantastic!!!,10,15 January 2019,"I saw this movie long ago without reading any review first. I loved it!!! So beautiful story! Been fed up with superheros movies with super action and breathtaking visual effect( without any acting), I was amazed by the story (later read that was a book by Edgar Rice Burroughs. That explained alot!! ). The movie (I believe the book also ) is the perfect blend of romance, action and super hero movie. Do not miss it!!!",John Carter
683,tylermbanks,One of my favorites!,9,23 December 2019,I really don't know why this movie did so bad and has such negative reviews. It's a great store with a great cast delivered perfectly. Plus the visuals are stunning. I sill watch it often because I love it every time.,John Carter
684,csgasser,Mars Lives!,10,17 March 2012,"The pundits appear to have lost all sense of fun and wonder. This movie was great. The action scenes were fantastic. Lynn Colins WAS ""Deja Thoris"" and all of the myriad denizens of Mars came to life. Kitch had a few weak scenes but otherwise did a great job of linking his pain from the past to his disdain for the present, tempered by his underlying sense of honor. Appropriately tepid at first his growing chemistry with Collins' character fit the story to a tee. One has to suspend disbelief for logical and scientific inconsistencies in such a story, but if you do you will be treated to a rousing tale and a great ride. I loved this movie and was very sorry when it ended because I wanted more!",John Carter
685,Margaret-17,Great adaptation,8,15 April 2012,"I don't understand some of the comments I've heard on the talk shows. Based on the ratings I've seen here, it's obvious that they never saw the film. We truly enjoyed this movie; the plot was good - I thought there were plenty of surprises, and the last few minutes had some fun ones. The acting was on the mark, Taylor Kitsch did a great job as John Carter(hope to see more of him as Gambit!) The special effects were great, I really loved how they did the air ships. The director kept the action moving along wonderfully, I didn't find myself yawning or wishing they'd get on with the story. Having read the Edgar Rice Burroughs books as a young person, I was well pleased with how the film brought the characters to life. I haven't read them in some time, but the movie brought back the same excitement and wonder that I remember feeling when I read his books about John Carter - Warlord of Mars. And my husband actually liked it! (he doesn't give a thumbs-up on very many movies). I'll definitely be getting this one on blu-ray!",John Carter
686,larryalbert,Burroughs finally gets his day.,9,10 March 2012,"I grew up reading reprints the Mars series by Edgar Rice Burroughs in the late 50's to mid 60's and I loved them. Today, for me they're almost unreadable. He wasn't a great writer, his was the prose of another time and medium, pulp magazines. However, that said his imagination was fabulous and truly worthy of his legacy. He created fantastic worlds peopled by heroes and villains worthy of Dumas. Like J. K. Rowlings his worlds were fully realized with customs and history established for his Martian, Venusian and center of the Earth civilizations. In a way its sad that he he is mostly remembered for his creation of Tarzan the Ape Man.Hollywood from 1918 on has over the years filmed his works, most Tarzan, with widely varying results. Today I saw John Carter and for my money filmdom has finally got it right. It's a long movie, over two hours,and I wasn't bored for one minute of it. True it's script is not a literal translation of his 1912 work ""A Princess of Mars"" but the characters and the world of Barsoom (Mars) and wonderfully brought to life and I had a marvelous time.Don't look for depth or meaning in this film, its a pure popcorn movie that harks back to the Jon Hall/Maria Montez series of the 40's, the swashbucklers of Errol Flynn, current superhero flicks with a bit of sudsy romance tossed in. The hero is stalwart, the heroine is drop dead gorgeous, can actually act and the CGI spectacular. It's a hoot, a romp and in 3D heck of a lot of fun. Don't analyze it just enjoy the fun and the froth.",John Carter
687,angatyr,Highly underrated,9,23 December 2012,"I went to see John Carter as a fan of the Edgar Rice Burroughs books; although I had not read them since I was a young lad. I remember the stories being so much fun, as opposed to the more somber, serious Sci-fi I have read like Asimov and Heinlein. What made the Burroughs books great, is the same as Robert E Howards' stories - they are written for sheer pleasure.I was keen to see the John Carter film in the cinema, but a busy lifestyle meant I nearly missed it. By the time I went - it was only showing at one late time each day. I had read the reviews on Metacritic and seen the low score on IMDb, so I was not expecting too much from it, but wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. I was shocked. Shocked by how much sheer joy was in the movie - it was fun, exhilarating, spectacular, over the top and effortlessly cheesy - just like the books! The special effects were great (better than the Narnia series, which, to me were a disappointment), especially getting the Tharks to interface with and act alongside John so seamlessly.Maybe it was because I had read the books, that I knew what I should have expected, but I do not understand why people have rated this film so low. It delivers on what it was meant to be: a fun adventure.I bought it on Blu-Ray as soon as I could and hence have shown it to so many of my friends who didn't see it because of the poor press it was receiving. Either because I had explained to them what it was about (fun - not serious melodrama) or because it is a really good movie, they loved it too.I sincerely love this film and think anyone who likes fun adventure stories in the vein of other Disney classics, but also enjoy Sci-Fi will love it also.I highly recommend this film, but you should know what to expect.",John Carter

This movie was spectacular but also explains a theory I have. This movie is an example of why the last lord of the rings tanked I know a lot of people saw both John carter and the hobbit final battle John carter costed so much more money that even if the people that saw it doubled it still would of flopped it's like charging. 10 cents for an ice cream cone when it costs a dallor to make ,it's good product what how do u make the money back",John Carter
690,marcogastelo,Great story,10,8 May 2019,There is no substitution for great sci-fi writing. I wish Hollywood paid the writers the big bucks instead of the clowns reading a script. The story is a great concept and has been around for 100 years. That's impressive.,John Carter

692,pmpax,Awesome Movie,10,11 March 2012,Just came back from seeing the film...and I must say that I really enjoyed it tremendously! It brought me back to when I was a young kid and would go to the movies with my father. It is an old school adventure film from when movies were made with passion and real care. The director Andrew Stanton really crafted this movie with a lot of love and you can tell that he really holds the John Carter character dear. They did a great job and I hope it does well enough so that we get to see more JC films.I highly recommend seeing this film!,John Carter

Guy gets strange powers, meets princess, who is forced.to marry bad guy, joins with other creatures to save the world..... blah.blah...blah.

695,steveau-2,Great fun film,8,19 March 2012,"Rather than go into a long winded review of all the details, as this has been done already on this site, I would just like to say the following :This film made for an enjoyable night out with my girlfriend, who though not a scfi fan like myself did like it.Having read the books a fair time ago from what I remember the story was fairly true to the books, which in some was doesn't help as this was written along time ago. If you put aside the technical details of the science then it worked well as just and adventure story with a few twists and some nice characters. Will be a shame if it totally flops as though not ground breaking it was still good fun.",John Carter
696,gdesign,"Not quite great, but very good.",8,12 March 2012,"If you have never read these books, then you probably will not get as much out of this movie, and certainly not out of the title - John Carter, which is meaningless, bland and says nothing of what the story is about. Perhaps Captain Carter, or simply Barsoom would have had more intrigue or zip. However, is was great to see Barsoom come to life, and the Tharks and creatures done with CGI justice.Some good sequences, planet not red enough, and although there are some good scenes and action sequences, there are no stirring scenes like Luke Skywalker looking out at the horizon in the original Star Wars (New Hope) with a glowing planet setting in the sky with John Williams' stirring score, or some Lawrence of Arabia scope and grandeur. It could have used more of that. I think they maybe got so bogged down in the details that they may have somewhat forgotten the emotional spectacle. (It wouldn't have hurt to have John Williams either) The other bothersome thing to fans, is the mispronunciation of Dejah Thoris's characters name by the princess herself and everyone else in the film. The way Burroughs intended the pronunciation is ""DEE-juh"" not ""DAY- Ja."" Big error.That being said, the movie is well acted by all, has some humour, good action, special effects and an enjoyable action adventure with several action pieces that have been stolen from it in so many other films since the books were written, but are here in their original form.Read the books, then see the movie bring that world to life. Terrific fun.",John Carter
697,cotywalker,Great movie!! Under rated by critics,10,12 March 2012,"This movie is far from a flop like people are reporting. My brother and I took our 11 and 10 year old to see and we all four loved the movie.Taylor did a great job as John Carter Lynn Collins looked AMAZING. The special effects were great. We watched it in 2D and we all loved the movie and I found it out so many were hating on this movie. I want a sequel since there are more books based on John Carter!!!! It had subtle comic hints in it, great characters and the story was fantastic of course. A movie I would watch again and buy on DVD when it comes out.Loved the movie and hope people go to see it in bunches because it is the first of MANY GREAT MOVIES ON THE SLATE THIS SPRING AND SUMMER!!!",John Carter
698,noetorres-1,"Not Like the Novel, But Not Bad - By an Edgar RIce Burroughs purist",7,11 March 2012,"In the large view, this film is passable entertainment, featuring lots of sword play, eerie landscapes, bizarre alien creatures, air combat, laser blasts -- the sort of stuff Hollywood loves to include in all SF blockbusters. Evoking memories of the Flash Gordon serials of yesteryear and the original Star Wars trilogy, the movie tries hard to be visually-appealing and action-filled, while remaining as faithful as possible to the source material, Edgar Rice Burroughs' (ERB) ""A Princess of Mars."" As a huge fan of SF and ERB and as someone who has read most of ERB's books, I have to commend Disney for turning out an interesting film despite highly compressing the story to fit a two hour time frame. As is the case with most novels made into movies, ""John Carter"" takes story elements that the novelist carefully unfolded in 10 or 20 pages and gives it 30 seconds on screen. Other reviewers have said the story as told by the film feels ""rushed,"" which is true.John Carter's development from a ""stranger in a strange land"" to a mighty warrior respected and prized by the Tharks also felt rushed in the film. I am certain that viewers unfamiliar with the books do struggle to keep the story straight as it blitzes forward. I'm hoping the movie will revive interest in the original books.A major non-ERB element added to the film is the elevation of the Holy Therns, who play a relatively minor role in the ERB books, to the status of alien masterminds who insidiously control all aspects of Barsoom's politics and culture. This, in my mind, significantly changes the complexion of the original novels. Obviously, the main purpose of the Therns in the film is to speed up the action and give the audience tangible ""bad guys"" to jeer at.Despite these deviations from the original novel, ""John Carter,"" I think succeeds in appealing to modern film goers while remaining relatively faithful to the source material. Going in, I was extremely fearful that Carter would suffer the same fate that Hollywood dealt to another one of my pulp heroes, Doc Savage, whose movie appeal was destroyed by the disastrous 1975 film. Thankfully, ""John Carter"" has not gone the way of ""Doc Savage: Man of Bronze.""",John Carter
699,uufysiiz,Most under-rated Disney Movie/Movie/Mars Movie,10,8 June 2020,It is an enjoyable move and story throughout every minute of it and will leave you wanting a sequel more than most movies.It'll also stand the test of time.

700,federation2,Much better than I anticipated,10,19 May 2016,"This movie came out in 2012 and I just now watched it. I heard all the negative hype and it even caused me to skip the movie, for which I now owe Disney and the fans of this series an apology. If you like space operas with great effects, compelling story and a premise with potential, then you'll like John Carter. There is the standard cheese factor, which is sometimes unavoidable, but even the greats like Star Wars had some of this as well. It also is not a perfect film, but the leads play well off each other and come across as genuine enough to enjoy the movie. The main villain is a bit unconvincing at first, but it isn't enough to really take you out of the movie. Some of the supporting cast are a bit weak as well, but Willem Dafoe does an excellent job in leading the group of otherwise OK supporting crew. Lynn Collins does an outstanding job as the female lead Dejah Thoris, and brings convincing strength and delivers weakness in equally convincing manner. Taylor Kitsch while probably breathing a little too heavily still delivers a more than adequate performance opposite Collins, and makes John Carter a compelling protagonist. The story was a breath of fresh air from all the super powered comic hero smash'em ups, and managed to hit the whole range of emotional highs and lows you've come to expect from a Disney film. Overall for being 4 years late to see this, I'm also happy, yet profoundly sad that this movie, cast and crew won't get a sequel. Poor marketing and status as what is regarded as one of the biggest flops of all time will probably see to that. Don't let it stop you if you haven't watched it yet, as it is a fine stand alone feature that has held up well.Again, Disney, fans and cast and crew of John Carter, I apologize. This movie deserved a better reception than it got.",John Carter

The lesson of this story is still very relevant today considering this was written a century ago. All those critics that think otherwise, they must have a weak sense of appreciation of what a good movie with a good morale story is. So sad that lot of people nowadays are quick to criticize but full of empty and shallow sense of values. I hope that anyone who have not seen this movie but heard negative reviews, do not quickly jump the wagon. Watch it first; and am sure, there are good values and lessons to be seen in this movie.

704,oysterpoboy,"Wow, this movie was even worse than my low expectations!",1,24 June 2012,"I watched this movie via rental. I had seen the initial reviews when the movie was in the theaters and it seemed that reviews were decent but this was a box office bust because of inadequate marketing and a poorly worded title which conveyed absolutely nothing about the story. So I thought I'd give this movie a chance on rental. That was a mistake. This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time. Here are my issues with the movie:1) The plot is incomprehensible. OK, so John Carter gets transported from the Wild West on Earth to Mars via some transportation gate into the midst of a war on Mars. Meanwhile there are some green skinny dudes that live in the desert who are initially neutral and then decide to fight on behalf of the good humans. There is an entitled princess character who doesn't want to get married to a not-so-bad looking human even though it would save her civilization from being annihilated by the bad humans who have harnessed the power of blue sticky string. And then there are three ever-transmorphing evil bald guys who seem to be manipulating the whole situation for some unclear purpose. There are also random flashbacks to a time when John Carter had a nice, regular family. That much I understand. I don't understand what any of these story lines have to do with each other. The rest of the movie basically consists of John Carter jumping around like a crazed grasshopper. 2) The plot, while being incomprehensible, manages to typify the standard Hollywood homage to the adolescent white male ego. The long haired rebel white male character is transported to a foreign land full of foreign, non-white non-humans, where he proceeds to kick foreign ass with super jumping powers and win the heart of the beautiful princess by engaging in some selfless act on behalf of the princess and her kind. The scene where John Carter kills hundreds of the green skinny dudes by himself until there is a literal pile of dead bodies on top of him is ludicrous and disturbing when you think about the implied parallels that are made in the movie between the green skinny dudes and Native Americans. I don't even recall why he had to kill so many of the green dudes in that scene. The plot was so incomprehensible. 3) Special effects were so-so. I suspect someone must have been embezzling money from this movie budget because I have no idea where else the $250 million dollars went. 4) Acting and dialogue were awful. No empathy for any of the characters whatsoever. John Carter is so freakin blase throughout the entire movie, it's annoying. Smile, or act surprised, or scared or something! You're on Mars for God's sake!5) Cinematography and editing was poor. Do we really need all of the fast zooms as John Carter unnecessarily jumps from one place to another? Jumps up, zoom in, jumps out, zoom out, jumps back in, zoom in, jumps back out, zoom out, ad nauseum. OK already, I understand that he's on Mars where there is less gravity, but I don't need to be subjected to headache inducing extreme zooms dozens of times throughout the movie. Those are my primary criticisms. I wish I had not spent the $3.99 to rent this movie.",John Carter
705,kittspalace,Me and the kids had fun,10,3 March 2012,"My Kids 15 and 9 enjoyed this along with me at the Disney movie premier at Hollywood studios. The beginning started out slow, possibly because we had never read the book or had any real idea what this movie was about. Once the characters were introduced and the story was on it's way, it was full of action adventure. SO although we started out not much enthused either way, by the end we were glued to our seats, and kind sad it was over.What is John Carter about, it's about a man who has nothing left to loose and no longer cares about life, or death. A man lost, who goes in search of treasure only to find trouble, and plenty of it. It's an action adventure with some comedy and love mixed into the ride. Well worth seeing it in theaters and I would highly recommend 3D the effects of 3d on this movie are incredible.",John Carter

So I'm adding a review because I believe this movie needs a chance. Such a pity it got such a shocking marketing plan then the downfall of few bad reviews that deterred us all from seeing it at the cinema.An interesting fact is that the director had too much control (even over the marketing - hence the 'flop' theory plus the budget blown).

711,woodsman233,My opinion,10,12 March 2012,"Awesome movie!!! Really great job on the story line. The movie was at just the right speed for the story line. The movie did not seem rushed at all. Great combination of genre's. The movie wasn't sappy or action pact to the point that it loses the story. Loved it! One of the better movies I've seen in quite awhile. What really seals the deal for me is that it ended with enough to sum up the movie but also enough to keep you guessing. Tough thing to do in the right way.I really enjoyed it. That's really all I can think of right now but IMDb says this review requires ten lines sooooooo: What does everyone else think? The reviews on here rated it a 7. I think it was at least a 9.

Not everyone agrees of cause but it has all the elements that a adventure movie requires. The viewers are expecting too much because usually movies are directed at certain people and or age groups I mean Disney made this movie so what does that tell us, so all the adults shouldn't expect too much as this is a family movie and is almost certainly aimed at kids to get there imagination going. I love adventure films, it gets my imagination going and I'm a adult and the Minuit I had seen the film I knew it would get a bad press from the critics but if it's good for you then who are they to argue that with you I mean if it works for you then regardless of there opinion. Others should watch this movie with a open mind because if you have already decided that the movie is bad before you have seen it then the chances are you wont like it and we all know bad news travels fast and good news travels slow.My advice is watch it as a family and keep in mind Disney made this so don't expect adult humour or blood and gore !",John Carter
713,mmcmenus,No body associated with this movie read the book,1,15 March 2012,"I have been looking forward to somebody making A Princess of Mars into a movie since I was 14. Frankly I was hoping for at least a Dune that followed the book exactly with bad acting. What I got was a Starship Troopers like movie that had only the name of the Characters and locations and nothing else from the book. I have read all 11 of the John Carter books and while I admit after the 5th in the series they get pretty formulaic, A Princess of Mars was so compelling I reread it several times. I believe this movie butchered the book worse than Starship troopers butchered that book. A Princess of Mars was almost a screen play and I figured with CGI it would be ""easy"" to make. I have no Idea why they thought they needed to add so much crap to this movie that was in none of the 11 books. The direct to DVD version followed the book better than this film did. Spoiler Therns don't appear until book 2 and are discredited by book 3 of the series. There was nothing of them being on earth. The Wohan tribe of green martians played a much bigger role in the book.There was no mention of the atmosphere plant or JC's ability to read all barsoomian minds.

IMDb should add ""comedy"" as a genre to the movie. if there was any potential of a great story or great fights then it was lost with overuse of comedy. Also, it seems like the Director or the Editor loves using the Tilt Shift very often, that he overused it on most of the scenes in the movie.I gave it 6/10 for its potential, I might have given it more If I entered the show with the intention of watching a comedy film, but no I was expecting a brutal experience with a well put story, like most of the people are.",John Carter

A total mess of a movie!Add to that an extremely bad 3D conversion and you have one of the worst movies of the year on your hands. It is clear that Disney thought that this would be their AVATAR, because JOHN CARTER looks like a near copy of that movie. Boy were they wrong! You cant just copy a massive blockbuster and think it will make money! You have to put a lot of care into what you put on screen, but director Stanton clearly didn't do that.

If you aren't sure whether this is the movie for you, the best way to describe it is Star Wars meets Indiana Jones. The film's initial concept of Mars is at first confusing, but you are quickly swept along with the film's fantastic story and things make sense. Critics will liken this film to Avatar; which isn't totally wrong, but this is an overall better film. The film does start out rather slow, explaining Mars and it's inhabitants; their customs, etc., but it then breaks into a run and the story flourishes, ending on a high note. Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins are standouts; yet their supporting cast is not far behind. The animators did a fantastic job with the visuals; one starts to believe this world could possibly exist.This film was clearly judged too harshly upon it's release; it does not deserve the 'box office flop' status that it has received. This film will no doubt become a cult classic; similar to Star Wars and Indiana Jones.",John Carter
718,ghek,We have the Princess! (Barsoomian equivalent of checkmate),9,25 March 2012,"Ex-Confederate cavalry officer is accidentally transported to mars... SAVE THE PRINCESS, SAVE THE WORLDBut seriously, I have been reading John Carter novels for 40 years and I appreciate all the effort made to bring it to the big screen (including the shoestring asylum effort which included good my princess/my chieftain scenes which are lacking in JC...though JC does have a very telling ""My Jeddek"" scene, but its not with John Carter who has apparently left the building)...Its a much smaller world then ERB imagined (some twenty-five plus city-states have been reduced to two and a couple of green martian hordes out of five)...but it has great detail which I cain't wait to look at on blue-ray (the Jasoomian 10th ray j/k)...In the book ""A Princess of Mars"" there were a few princesses....in the movie we have two...most probably overlook the fact that Sola is a green martian princess...in true ERB fashion she is a hidden princess... The Barsoomina 8th ray (which repels against ""mars"" and is treated as a gas in sealed tanks in the book) appears to be used in conjunction, so it would seem, with another ERB technology, the ""equilibrimotor"" to move the craft since they no longer seem to have movement via propellers driven by radium powered motors. Per the screen play, the ""motor"" is solar powered and extra energy is stored. Hence the dramatic flying action is driven in the movie by having the sun dimmed by shadow or sandstorm... Age isn't mentioned in the movie...in the book 1000 years is normal (optional trip down the River Iss at that point) and you probably start to look old long before 2000 years have passed...so the princess, given her accomplishments is probably in the 35 to 80 range...I say this as the viewpoints of the characters in the movie are very clear...they have had a lot of time to think about things... So is it a good movie?, yes it is...many scenes are quite captivating and not easily forgotten...its nice to have another scifi adventure that you can watch with your family...I am hoping for extended scenes on blue-ray and for more of the 11 books to come forth at movies.",John Carter

I can't think of a better word to describe it - you'll either love it or hate it but, unlike just about every other movie that's come out in the past 10 years, this is one you have to see in theaters.Expect a classic story that's been inappropriately Disney-fied, expect a little blockyness in the narrative as a result, expect a tale of chivalry & true heroism - elements long since seen in theaters & expect a truly vast experience. Interesting characters, amazing sets & an original -unique- story. The inspiration for Star Wars, Star Trek & the entire sci-fi genre is finally on the big screen - only 100+ years in the making.

721,Taranaichsaurus,An admirable adaptation and great adventure rarely seen in modern times.,10,29 March 2012,"I'm a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs' original novel, and was aware that there would be changes. I went into the film, fully expecting the little voice in my head to say ""calm down, grit your teeth, it's just an adaptation, don't worry about it."" And I had cause to gripe: there were changes. Changes I disagree with, changes I felt weren't necessary, changes I think made the film less than it could have been. Even so, I enjoyed the film so much that I didn't even acknowledge them. They were there, but everything was so well done, committed with such surety and confidence that this was the right way to go, that I couldn't help but go along with it. I went in there ready to hate the Therns, Dejah Warrior Princess, Reluctant Anti-Hero John Carter and the myriad alterations. But Stanton, Chabon and everyone involved were so earnest and determined that they made sure that even a pedantic literature aficionado like me didn't even notice.That is what a good adaptation is all about. When changes are made, they are not done because ""the studio mandated it,"" or ""because this is more cinematic,"" or ""because it was stupid in the source material and needed changing."" They are because ""this is necessary for the story I'm trying to tell, in the way I'm trying to tell it.That's not to say I agree with the choices. I really missed the nuances of Sola's back story and Thark society, the poignancy of Woola's devotion is diluted a tad, and I don't think the Therns were woven into the story well enough. Carter's arc is probably the weakest element, being predictable and pointless. I don't know whether it's because I gave the film the chance, or because Stanton & co did a good job condensing, but even these things didn't dull my enjoyment. I don't expect all Burroughs fans to be as accommodating: no doubt there's someone out there who cannot love the film due to the changes, or who wasn't sufficiently drawn into the film. I can respect that, and I can understand Barsoomians who wanted more. I know I wanted more: I would've been happy to sit through a three-hour film. But given all possibilities, this is far better than I expected. It may not be the Barsoom Burroughs fans have been waiting 100 years for, it may not be the closest adaptation possible, it may not be as good a film as it could have been. But to me... it was enough.Going through all the things I liked about the film would take forever. Taylor Kitsch was pretty far from the John Carter in my head, but he worked. The Tharks are a good deal less broad, imposing and alien than the beings in my imagination, but their personality and design more than made up for that. The creatures, settings and designs were nothing short of spectacular. Woola was awesome, of course. Purefoy's Kantos Kan was immensely enjoyable in the few scenes he appeared. All the other characters save Dejah Thoris were well-acted and portrayed. The Princess of Helium, on the other hand, was one of the most delightful surprises: Lynn Collins brings a perfect mix of the godly and the womanly to the role, a feat I never thought could be done.There are parts in the film which are so well done, shivers ran down my spine. Carter's first steps were just like how I imagined them, right up to the incubator and first encounter with Tars Tarkas. Then there are the set pieces like the airship battle, the charge of the Warhoon, the first sighting of Helium. The beauty of this film! When JC rallies the Tharks to ride to Zodanga, I damn near leapt out of my chair - and that's no hyperbole. I don't exaggerate about things like that.Looking beyond relation to the books and visuals, the film did a great job of bringing something more than spectacle. There's a scene in the middle of the film which, while a smidgen manipulative, is nonetheless just subdued enough to have maximum impact. The commentary on imperial expansion, tribal conflict, frontier ideologies and manifest destiny is happily retained in the adaptation, and there for viewers willing to look for it. Plus you have the usual foreshadowing and Chekhov's Guns in effect adding cinematic stanzas. All well-made, excellently executed, good stuff all round.The film has been compared to Avatar for obvious reasons. I think it's unfair: this is a much better film than Jake Sully's wacky adventures. It's certainly superior to a great number of films I've seen over the years. I'm confident in saying that, flawed as it is, I think it's comparable to the better fantasy films I've seen. I'm talking Conan the Barbarian and, yes, The Lord of the Rings trilogy. This film can hang with them, no problem.I would even go so far as to say it's on the level of Star Wars. I saw that film quite late in childhood, perhaps affecting my reception to it,but I certainly felt thrills, a sense of wonder, and fascination with the world that was created. What I'm saying is that watching John Carter, I felt the exact same sorts of emotions as when I first watched Star Wars. As a 27-year-old, who's endured countless atrocious adaptations, repugnant remakes and ridiculous re imaginings. That has to count for something.It's not perfect. It's not the best adaptation. But it's good enough for me.Go see John Carter.",John Carter
722,glennehill,Disappointing...More Sci-Fi CG action pablum,5,11 March 2012,"I have to admit having read the books and enjoyed them the movie was a let down. The books were about a stranger in a strange land like 'Shogun' or 'The Last Samurai'. The writers dumb it down and made it just another politically correct sci-fi / fantasy action flick with formulaic plot. The acting was good and Taylor Kitsch was a believable John Carter. I thought Special effects were very well done. But what happened to telling a good story with a little edge. Disney had a great story and threw it out. Disney should never have been allowed to produce this. HBO should do a series and do it right. If you have not read the books and interested in being entertained with action pablum, enjoy. geh",John Carter
723,jc1952,Not an Event Movie-Execution Is Not Memorable or Convincing,5,9 March 2012,"OK I sat on the sidelines and read as plenty of hate-trolls, fan-trolls, and troll-trolls have given their opinion of this movie although they have not seen it. I also read plenty of reviews from people who did see it, both users and critics. Before I went to see it, I was almost certain I would love it as big budget Sci-Fi/Fantasy/VFX/CGI with live- action movies are very entertaining and immersive if done well. I was disappointed....really disappointed. Despite going into the IMAX 3D theater thinking I would love it, my rating is a Generous 5 out of 10 for the following reasons: The experience was not immersive as the cinematography was hazy, like everything was shot through a foggy lens. Now this may be what they wanted in the design of the film, but it was neither attractive or comfortable on the eyes. - The 3D effect was lacking greatly due to poor angles and apparent lack of knowledge or execution in its application. Although there were some opportunities to linger longer on some of the best 3D perspectives shown in the movie (on the river and some expansive scenes), Stanton chose to chop the scenes off abruptly before you could enjoy the breathtaking sights. - Stanton's pacing is inconsistent, It lurches along from scene-to-scene. His presentation is not nearly as tight as Brad Bird's in MI Ghost Protocol. Some will say this may be caused by the serial nature of his source, Princess of Mars, but I maintain that he should have taken this into consideration in the overall design and editing of the movie and improved upon its flow. - The action scenes are middling at best, but usually poor because it is not smooth in coordination and execution. - The action sequences are abysmally short and not convincing. Any detractors of Avatar can say whatever they want but Cameron's final battle WAS EPIC. There is not one epic action moment in all of John Carter.........extremely disappointing. - Design of the costumes (errr... I mean wardrobes) for the humanoid Barsoomians was ludicrous. Roman outfits with feathers on the shoulders and essentially indistinguishable from one another so you could barely (or not at all) tell an enemy from friend during battles. - Stanton is pitiful when it comes to moving his live action actors around the set. I never got the feeling that anything happening on screen was natural. The actors were stiff and he did not position them either for maximizing 3D effect or for conveying any body language or realistic interactions between them. - There were some moments when I felt embarrassed for the actors and started looking at my watch hoping that their agony would soon end. I distinctly got the feeling that they knew they were performing in one dud of a movie, despite its very large budget. - The movie just had an incomplete feel to it, as though it was 2-3 months before the final cut and post-processing. I am thinking that it was not delayed only because they didn't want to put any more money into it knowing that it was a $ loser. - Speaking of losing money......there were ~30-35 people (capacity ~350) at the midnight IMAX 3D show I attended and the reaction at the end was one of relief for most of them based on conversations I overheard. Also, I talked to 3 other men and asked them if they thought it would make money. None of us thought it would bring in more than was spent on making it.....0 out of 4. - Overall, this was not the ""event"" movie required to get the large number of people or repeat viewers necessary to increase favorable word-of-mouth marketing. Lynn Collins looked real good and the Tharks were interesting but drab. The Tharks were well done motion capture beings and the actors/actresses who perform utilizing this technique are not given nearly enough credit. All too often, a lot of reviews simply state that ""so-and-so"" was ""the voice for"" one of these characters when, in fact their motions and some of their emotions are depicted very well. If anything, the Tharks and Ms Collins were the brightest stars (to me). I liked the idea of someone making a John Carter movie and thought most of what was included was fine but the execution was not convincing or memorable. Including ERB in the movie at the beginning and end was effective but Daryl Sabara was way too wide- eyed. I especially liked the way the end was handled, leaving it open for a sequel (or not).Anyway, I saw the movie. I wanted to love it. I tried to like it, but overall I was not impressed.",John Carter

I never saw the thief's face so I couldn't report it. Lol. Mostly now I avoid theaters like the plague. But I had been waiting to see John Carter for a while so I carved out some time this weekend to go see it. It did not disappoint.John Carter reminded me of the 80's when they still made great sci-fi/fantasy movies with standout characters and excellent plots. To me this movie was beyond good. It was great! I am very critical of movies and a big fan of the genre (sci-fi/fantasy) both in movies and books. Most of these type movies made in current times fail miserably because more energy is spent in CGI effects and battle scenes than building characters, story lines, and worlds that are rich and believable. You have to have a good balance. Movies now are often rushed (like Conan the Barbarian and Clash of the Titans) or too long (like Avatar) and seemingly made for people with attention deficit disorder (like Jonah Hex). But they got everything right this time in John Carter. I cannot think of one fault to criticize except it ended. The actors were all brilliant, the story line and characterizations were very well done, and the CGI effects were realistic and not overdone and at the same time stunning.This was a movie I truly enjoyed and would go back to the theaters and see again. When it ended many people in the theater actually applauded. I haven't seen that in a long while. If you loved the old classics like Star Wars you will love John Carter. This is the type of movie that will stand up over time. Please support John Carter so more movies like this will be made. Let the movie makers know that people still appreciate a good story and good acting. Bravo Disney! Thanks for a good time at the movies.",John Carter
726,joeescott72,Better than I'd planned for.,8,12 March 2012,"Since I saw the first trailer last year and since I was a boy reading Burrough's stories, I'd been wanting to see this movie. Of course, as a pubescent kid, it was mostly because they didn't wear clothes on Mars. Knowing that 1. Disney was at the helm of this movie and 2. it didn't star Johnny Depp, I wasn't really expecting to be impressed. I'm neither a fan of Friday Night Lights (sorry Taylor) nor am I a fan of X-Men Origin: Wolverine (Sorry Ms. Collins). I was so pleased then when the movie was as excellent as it was. Kitsch and Collins were excellent together. The action was paced perfectly. The voice acting for the CGI characters was just about perfect. Once I saw it, I went home, got my wife and took her. My wife is absolutely against action movies, and believes that 3D is actually a torture device used against moviegoers, but even she found it visually engaging and excellent.

727,hjohnson0051,Epicness and Innocence captured with one film,10,16 March 2012,"John Carter is a film that had to wait just over 100 years to be turned into a movie. This is because when it was written, this Sci-fi / Fantasy story was so far ahead of its time. It is ironic that people have referred to the story as unoriginal, seeing as how the story was written before any of the previously made copy cat movies in the genre. I have seen this movie twice now in theaters. Once with my drinking buddy and once with my mother. There are very few movies that have the ability to capture the heart and imagination of such a wide audience. It truly saddens me that because the adds for this movie were so clichéd it wont be appreciated by the masses as it deserves to be. Even sadder is the fact that the sequel will never be made.",John Carter

It is one of the most beautiful films I have seen in this genre and though I read the book a long time ago when I was in my teens, it seems that Stanton has done an excellent job of bringing the story to life and improving on the character of the Princess. It is a great adventure story. I was not familiar with either of the two leads, but they were both great and bring the love story real sizzle. And then all my favorite actors from HBO are here in supporting roles, so no complaints. This is a family friendly film, that an adult will get as much out of as the kids, so in that regard it is like Stanton's films at Pixar. And like Avatar, it brings an important message to the fore that becomes the hero's quest, but not before earning your involvement, too. The whole adventure left me hungering for more from the Princess of Mars!",John Carter
729,lind_d,Does not disappoint an ERB long time fan.,10,12 March 2012,"First off I want to address the reviews done by ""professional"" critics. Its sad you get paid to bash someones art work when you are not qualified to create anything yourselves. Andrew Stanton is one of the most talented movie makers of our time, and ERB was one of the most famous and imaginative authors America ever produced! If any movie EVER deserved a franchise it is this one. (This movie proves the ""Critics"" are unqualified morons who don't deserve the paycheck they receive for their miserable existence. Shame on you.)Now for the movie. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job making a movie based on "" A Princess of Mars."" ERB's first novel was a great story, but I actually think Stanton improved on certain aspects. Especially the getting to Mars part. I don't usually see a film more than once at the theater but this is one exception I'll be making. I really loved this movie. And judging by the user reviews here I think that is the majority view. I agree with other reviews that this may be my favorite movie of all time. As an ERB fan I am VERY pleased with this movie. ERB wrote this story when flight was in its infancy, and there was virtually NO Sci-Fi. ERB inspired some of the greatest stories and films of the genre.Stanton did everything right given the source material. Some of the ""critics"" complained about not being able to follow the story or didn't get why JC could jump and had power. Well...you're criticizing a master story teller who still sells books 62 years after his death and 100 years after his first story was published. Its laughable to me anyone has the gall to do that. You don't have to like the movie but very few people don't. I think all the bad reviews I read have been from ""Critics.""I realize not everyone will like this movie, or likes Sci-Fi or ERB...and that's OK. If you like Sci-Fi and and/or are an ERB fan you'll love this movie. Ignore the critics, they are just miserable little human beings who hate their own existence any way and can only justify their waste of life by criticizing someone who actually takes a chance and creates something. The only reviews anyone should ever be concerned with are normal real people...people who are NOT getting PAID to voice their opinion. Someone getting paid to write reviews has an automatic bias and therefore are disqualified. Did I mention I don't like movie critics???...LOL. Here's the spoiler part...JC is not a fan of war. He's tired of fighting, he lost his wife and child due to war, and he thinks man is brutish. However, he's good at it...and even better given his ""Mars"" powers.

735,Duckworth_max,Not that big of a spoiler,1,10 March 2012,"Before I start, I just want to point out that the 'spoiler' of this review is not that serious (I will say ***SPOILER*** before I write it) and that I only rated this as a 1/10 because there is no 0/10 option.Considering past Disney PG-13 movies, I went into John Carter with fairly low expectations (4.7/10 - I would consider around 6.7/10 to be acceptable). However, this movie was so horrifically bad that it failed to come anywhere near those expectations.Before I get to the main issue, I will quickly address a few small problems I encountered with the movie. Firstly, the acting was horrific. Secondly, the the airships looked like they had been copy/pasted from Avatar. Thirdly, why fight over a planet with 2 cities when you have the technology to fly to Earth? Fourthly, the (ridiculously looking) aliens had laser guns/futuristic airships but still rode (the mars-equivalent of) horses. Fifthly, there is a load of completely unnecessary details like various beliefs that don't really contribute the story. Sixth-ly, the first thirty minutes was like watching paint dry (well, especially the first thirty minutes as it was all a dull experience). These issues are just the tip of the iceberg.My primary problem with this movie was ****SPOILER START**** you could predict the ending after about 3 minutes. It starts of with Carter's nephew reading Carter's journal (which describes his Mars-story). While this is all well and good, this basically tells us that Carter, at some point, leaves Mars to come back to Earth as for him to leave the journal in his house he would have had to have traveled back. Considering the movie is about him trying to get back to Earth, this way of story- telling killed the suspense. Also, towards the end, the movie tries to fool you into thinking that he chooses to stay on Mars. This was all to lead up to a twist ending (which wasn't much of a twist) that doesn't even come close to redeeming the huge suspense-killer. ****SPOILER END****The ONE AND ONLY positive thing that I can say about the movie is that it has some nice effects , its a shame the great animation was wasted on stupid-looking aliens and copy/pasted airships. This will probably be my worst movie of 2012 (its worse than almost every 2011 movie, excluding Jack and Jill) and, considering this was an 'origin story' we will probably fall victim to a sequelTERRIBLE MOVIE 0.76/10",John Carter

Then you continue with the familiar story of a strange person coming to an unfamiliar place, saves the princess and becomes the tribe leader.I had a rough time not turning off the DVD player and abandon the movie, I did however fast forward some scene that were boring and predictable.I give it 4 stars only because of the special effects which were good.",John Carter

In fact my viewing of the moving was entirely due to circumstances of convenience and boredom. What I actually found when I sat in the dark cinema to view this movie was actually a small bit of movie gold. The film exceeded all expectations and kept me entertained from beginning till end. The movie was filled with everything necessary; a believable hero (of course as believable as a movie about mars can be), wonderfully filmed cinematics, steady and pleasant character development, comedy in seemingly all the right places, and the proper mix of action that kept it from getting getting to stale. Don't listen to the critics, go out and see the movie for yourself and be your own judge, but I believe this movie is one that everyone can easily fall in love with if their fans of this genre.

The movie was inspired by the book but I didn't find it to be ""A Princess of Mars."" They took the idea and ran with it. The result is an entertaining film.

So we went to the movie theater to watch John Carter. My hopes weren't very high, but the good thing is that watching a movie in the theaters will normally make the film more enjoyable to watch and it certainly did.It was a fine night out and i enjoyed myself, but there is a lot of points of the movie i'm pretty critical about. My final conclusion of the film is that it really isn't a ""good"" film, but it does make a good night out. First of all the acting.. The acting was pretty bad and you could see it in the first seconds of the film. Somehow you just see that they are talking to a green screen except of talking to an actual human being or ""alien"" to be precise. For my opinion it's also the script.Secondly the story... I forgive them because the book was released in 1917 so the story itself -was- original, but for now in 2012 it's not. It's really standard, cheesy and you've seen it all before. It gets very obvious that they wanted to make a film on the success of Avatar.So..

I also applaud the people responsible for casting Lynn Collins.She is Great! Finally a movie with a woman fighter who is not pencil thin and very well built.I don't know why Hollywood is obsessed with sickly looking women beating up men these days. This movie is filled with almost everything you would want to keep you glued to the story line,Action,romance and a little comedy.I liked the fact also the mixture of the story line with aliens and humans but not exactly like star wars. Very uniquely balanced storyline. 10 stars to this great movie",John Carter
741,pollux1972,Where's the love?,9,19 March 2012,"I am not going to go through the plot of the film to summarize it, nor am I going to whine about the ways the film departed from Edgar Rice Burroughs' original series. Lots (250 or so) of other reviewers have given their opinions, pro-film or anti-film, already. I am writing merely to add my voice to the pro-film lobby. Here's why: I found the story and the details providing back stories to be compelling and enjoyable. I was thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the film, despite it being over the two-hour mark. In fact, I would go so far as to say that I would have added another ten minutes to the film to parallel the books more perfectly, but as it was, it held my attention and entertained me very much.I was pleased with both of the ""unknown"" lead actors' performances--Taylor Kitsch turned in a nuanced performance as a rather stoic civil war veteran who finds himself on Mars amid conflict (most of the civil war vets that I have known have been rather stoic, after all). His character blooms as the plot progresses and he falls in love with the beautiful, feisty, Lynn Collins. Reviewers who found their performances ""wooden"" have either not read the books or were just expecting the giant characters in their heads from childhood reading of Burroughs' books to play out on the screen.What I was most pleased with, aside from the great story well acted, was the flawless incorporation of CGI green martians, Woolah, etc. Movies that rely on CGI often distract me, sometimes with jerkiness, etc. John Carter is a fantastic CGI experience--It was easy for me to suspend my disbelief and melt into the action and story of the film without being aware of the animation (full disclosure: I found even Avatar's CGI to be more distracting. Perhaps I am just fully used to it, or perhaps Pixar just does it better).John Carter left me wanting a sequel. I gave it nine of ten stars because it did just what it promised, carrying me away from reality to Mars on a Sunday afternoon, and I reserve 10 for life-changers.",John Carter

The director and writers have clearly never heard the phrase ""Action Packed"".Was it romance???? If so the ""no, no, no, no, suddenly yes"" was clearly written by a man thinking he knows romance and failing. If the romance was hap-hazardly poked into the movie to make women swoon then they clearly don't understand women. Who wants to be second best to a corpse? Not me. If it was fantasy / adventure???? Then for Gods sake buy some originality! It seems like this is the lite version of 100 different movies I've seen cut and paste together.There was no moral story at the end! What was the point????

The end.,4,6 March 2012,"Hasn't the time come for the movie going audience to stop giving passable grades to movies, merely because they have nice looking visuals? Personally, i think that time has come. And it is because of the movie John Carter.Yet again we are treated with the same old formula that we have seen million times before. The handsome hero, the damsel in distress with big breasts, the bad guy with a scar on his face and CGI aliens that came rolling right out of one of the Star Wars prequels (read: lifeless puppets that stand out like a sore thumb.) The story is predictable from start to finish and there were more plot holes then i could count. I could have forgiven all of this if ANY of the characters had any form of depth to them and made me care something about all the boring action sequences. They don't.My advice: watch the trailer for Avatar again, imagine instead of a forest setting that it's a desert setting, and a dog with six legs for comic relief. There. I have saved you the cost of your ticket as well as the unpleasant feeling of holding your pee in for too long. And nausea.",John Carter
745,vespine77,"Incredible, yet disappointing somehow...",8,11 March 2012,"Having read A Princess of Mars and waiting for this movie to be released since pre-production, I took my seat in the cinema with a huge, stupid grin on my face. What happened over the next couple of hours will stick with me for years; I witnessed one of the most impressive movies I've seen in a long while, yet still walked out with a feeling of disappointment.Lets start with the ups...As with most people, I was blown away by the visuals. The barren landscape served as a perfect backdrop for the beautifully realised flora, fauna, architecture and machines. ""Eye candy"" is a phrase that does little justice to the optic smörgåsbord that Stanton offers up.The script and the acting were believable, more-so than the execution in Avatar, as well as the relationship between Kitsch and Collins, there are several subtle character relationships that could easily be over-done but the chemistry I found, was right on the money.Where the film falls down for me is the constant narrative explaining where we are and what we're watching. Rather than falling into the world of Barsoom, finding our own way around and making our own mind up as to the motives of the characters, we are blinkered and led down a very narrow path. Some could and would argue that this is simply good direction... a little nudge now again is fine, but incessant prodding gets tiring after a while.Despite this, the stupid grin on my face was there the whole time, with the exception of one sequence (which I won't spoil) midway through the movie where I had to summon all my testosterone to prevent me from weeping like a 14 year old girl after her first viewing of Titanic.The ending was nothing short of perfect. So many movies these days simply fizzle out in either an obvious or a sloppy way and I was expecting nothing different here. How wrong was I?!Hopefully there will be a few more adventures on Barsoom to come, I just hope in the next one we're not spoon-fed the whole way through. We're big boys and girls, even if we haven't got an intimate knowledge of ERB's novels, we can still figure it out...",John Carter
746,w-campbell-20-70210,Only vaguely follows the story,4,22 July 2012,"I have read the John Carter of Mars books from cover to cover several times. Except for the location and character names, the movie barely resembles the book. There are several characters that appear in the movie that never existed in any of the novels. I feet that Mr. Burroughs would not appreciate the butchery of his stories in this manner. Not the first time this has happened The author of Run Silent, Run Deep was so upset by the way his story was butchered, he left the premier and refused to allow his name to be associated with the movie. I'm sure Mr. Burroughs would have reacted the same way. I realize that it is not always possible to alway follow the books, but this was way out in left field. Having said all that, I guess this would pass as a decent midnight movie on TV, when the only thing else to watch are infomercials.",John Carter
747,algadrie_syedhassan,Doesn't deserve the negative reputation it received.,8,7 September 2014,"I've never written a review on this site but after watching this movie I was compelled do so. I think it was unfortunate that the response to this movie was mostly negative because I thought the movie was a lot better than what most of the critics made it out to be. Sure it has it's flaws and some uneven and slightly jarring aspects to the movie but it was still a satisfying thrill ride. It has everything you want from a quality sci-fi movie. It has a well crafted story, good and well fleshed out characters, it has action, beautifully designed scenery and most importantly it has heart. The acting was also quite good. Lead actor Taylor kitsch, a much maligned actor whose main critique was always his lack of charisma regarding leading roles does quite well here. Lynn Collins also managed to hold her own in portraying a balance between a strong warrior woman and an elegant princess. Although the chemistry between Mr Kitsch and Ms Collins wasn't all there, it was far from cringe worthy. Willem Dafoe and Thomas Haden Church's performance as aliens known as Tharks are fantastic. Dominic West and Ciaran Hinds are always a welcoming addition to any movie. In my book at least. Considering the budget of the movie it should have dazzling visuals, more so than others. It does. The movie is filled with beautiful landscapes and amazing special effects. It made you believe that what they were showing on the screen was actually a full blown alien planet. The CGI and creature designs are quite spectacular. Most of this is due to the director, Andrew Stanton. His experience with Pixar movies made the visuals very detailed and very believable. The story itself has a very distinct 'space opera' feel to it. I wouldn't be surprised if Star Wars took a few elements from the source material of this movie. So if you're a fan of Star Wars you'll definitely appreciate this movie. Despite what the critics said about this movie, this movie is a must watch for fans of Sci-fi movies. You'll be missing a great movie experience if you don't. Three and a half stars out of five.",John Carter
748,teendude7,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,1,24 March 2012,"With a budget of 250 million, I expected this movie to be brilliant. Well, to say it fell short is to understate it. The acting and the plot were terrible. Only the visual effects stood out and those didn't matter after appalling story and acting. The fact that it has been a dump at the box office just says it all. It was boring and seemed unimaginably fake. One of the worst mistakes the producers of the movie made was to star no established actor in such a big budget movie. I felt like leaving in the interval itself but I hoped that it would become better as the movie progressed. It didn't happen. I felt like I really wasted my money. Should have realized it will be horrible after I saw the trailer.DO NOT WATCH IT! I BEG YOU TO NOT WATCH IT. and as for the people who liked it, i bet they haven't ever seen a good movie",John Carter
749,yvx1222,"Critics are wrong - To summarize, Don't miss this movie!",9,9 March 2012,"It's worth noting that my view before going into see ""John Carter"" was nor for or against, unlike many of the 'trolls' and 'fanboys' among this films Message Board. Those endlessly hating on the film for no apparent purpose or gain, just as equal, the die-hard ERB fans take too many liberties in assuming the movie has to be good because of it's source material. Trust me, just because the original material is great (which the 'of Mars' books are) does not mean the big-screen adaption is going to follow suit.In keeping the majority of the contents of the film unknown to those who haven't seen anymore than what was advertised, it will probably appear that I'm dancing around the plot, but I feel it necessary to outline much of what the marketing campaign failed to do, while keeping the surprise of seeing the movie blissfully ignorant intact.Everything you've seen in the trailers, from the superhuman leaps the titular protagonist makes, to the 'how and why' of his presence on Mars, are explained intelligently, and without boorish exposition. The set-pieces are awe-inspiring and do a fine tribute to how Mars was so creatively described in Edgar Rice Burroughs imaginative novel. Having read ""A Princess of Mars"", I can say there quite a similar view of ""Barsoom"" (as the it's native inhabitants call it) between how I imagined it, and it was depicted. The action sequences are unequal to anything I've seen in many years. It had a reflection of classic cinema that draws you in so much, that you feel just as much on Mars as you are on Earth.The film visually didn't have any subtractions. Camera angles, and extremely convincing CGI put this film ahead of it's time. By that, I mean it has the charm of a classic, on par with works of Marlon Brando or Charlton Heston, while also being modern in not only its storytelling, but its visualization of ERB's classic tale. My one nit-pick, which virtually went unnoticed for most of the scenes where it took place, was a few angles of John Carter leaping did stick-out to me one or twice where it had an overall appearance of him being pulled upward by a harness, rather than a hop due to lower gravity than that on Earth. But I was engaged in the movie so much that it didn't remove me from the movie at all, or detract from my overall experience.Noting the films director, Andrew Stanton, you couldn't help but notice his quality storytelling that makes you not only connect with the characters, but care about what happens to them. A bit of the romance between John Carter, and his damsel in distress Princess Dejah Thoris seemed rushed, but for the sake of convenience of storytelling in a 2-hour movie that does its best to keep great pacing, I can easily overlook it due to both Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins in they're respective performances.From being to end, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. John Carter is a fun, dazzling, joy-ride of cinema-magic that we have seemed to take for granted in modern movies. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was, as many of the audience-goers that attended the same showing seemed to be too! I plan on seeing it a second time next week!

But when i saw it a couple weeks ago in 3D, i was amazed and i enjoyed it. Yeah, it was a little bit cheesy BUT do you expect. It was very entertaining, right from the beginning. It had you drawn in right at the start, post-civil war right to a war torn mars. Intense fight scenes and battle, mars creatures, and it also stayed very true to the books.

751,chips1001,John Carter is a waste of a £250mil budget...,4,12 March 2012,"John Carter is definitely going to be on this years flop list. With a high budget of $250million you really expect better. What did John Carter do right? Well the visuals were great, the CGI for the aliens from Mars was good, only complaint I had was watching the movie in 3D looked as if the people weren't very rounded and didn't really look part of the movie, it looked more as if the people were cut out and stuck on to some sandy background... yeah that's all John Carter did right in my opinion and even that could have been improved, Avatar had the same budget but the effects looked better but this is understandable due to the sandy background John Carter had, while Avatar had different vivid colours and lets not forget James Cameron is an amazing director.So you're thinking where did John Carter go wrong. Well the story never really got going it wasn't very interesting until the ending of the movie which was decent. The action scenes in this movie were terrible, for a movie which is claiming to be a action/adventure it didn't deliver with the action at all as they didn't get you on the edge of your seat of make you think ""Wow!"" to yourself once. Taylor Kitch acting wasn't great either how he just suddenly learns how to walk when he can't control his weight on a different planet was just odd.I'd give John Carter a 4/10 just for its good visuals and its ending even though the climax of the movie didn't really come.",John Carter
752,auralenz,Simple Fan Troll,10,1 March 2012,"This film was a property I longed for to be made, and now I have to wait over 2 years for Gods of Mars. The earth moments are virtually like the book-he is a ex-Confederate soldier, etc.. and though we get to Mars pretty quickly, it didn't seem rushed. The dialogue about the Martian politics might be too much for some to follow, but go with it-you wouldn't want it to sound like eye-gouging SW prequel politics—on Barsoom there is so much to see. For this fan-troll its obvious that Stanton is holding back (cuz Disney said Warhoons or Banths, Andrew, you cant have both), and I want everyone to know that this great movie, being the origin story, is merely an appetizer for all the action in the next several installments. The Tharks are well done-I like what they do when they first see the Helium and Zodangan ships, which by the way, though different from the buoyancy tank ships described by ERB, still have that wooden, jump from ship to ship among cannon fire, pirate ship movie moments. Kitsch, Collins-yum, Dafoe, and the other actors(who we'll see more of next go round), provided the perfect gravitas required to believe where we are, and their thoughts about the project are in interview clips all over the net. The labor of love enthusiasm for the source that Stanton had is plainly evident in everything on the screen, including the actors portrayals of these archetype characters. The music really fit every moment. I had to laugh in satisfaction when the crescendos during an action sequence reminded me of John Williams. I was worried about plot tweaks-the Therns especially, but since the story is headed in the same direction as the books, they are extremely minor. The CGI is great. I don't understand when people slam it. Whether its Avatar or anything, we all know there actually is no such place as Barsoom, Pandora, etc.. So, some haters will always see fantastic fauna as ""fake- looking"". If someone can have the suspension of disbelief in horrid successes like Transformers, Twilight, or Tron to a degree, even found footage movies, Stanton's JC should be gospel ! I hope we see more old-fashioned sci-fi/fantasy committed to the screen. ERB's Pellucidar, Venus, and Caprona, just as a start. There are more great works out there besides PK Dick, and Stanton is the trailblazer for their realization. I can easily name dozens of authors. So if you think Hollywood has gone off the deep end-and many times I don't blame you, please be relieved that tentpole films like JC still can be made. 10 out of 10. Five Stars. I loved it. Thank you Andrew. (So what if I'm biased, and will see it again at midnight next week)",John Carter

I will admit I did not know the existence of the John Carter of Mars or the Barsoom Series by Burroughs. Honestly I can't believe I didn't know about this epic adventure and truly original story until I saw the first trailer for the movie and began researching Burroughs. I have to say I am now a big fan especially since watching the movie and I plan on getting all the volumes of the Barsoom series and reading them asap.I would consider my self an avid movie goer and definitely a Sci-fi fan, with that in mind I can see only little validation with what some critics are saying. But anyone who criticizes this movie for ripping off or deriving its story from other movies such as Star Wars, Avatar or even Star Trek needs to check their facts and actually do a little research to plainly see that George Lucas, James Cameron and even Gene Roddenberry were the ones who were influenced BY Burroughs' truly original tales which he began writing in 1912! Anyway I hope and believe that John Carter will pick up in popularity while its still in theaters and will become a dearly loved franchise that will have its own place on the per-verbal shelf next to Star Wars and Avatar.",John Carter
755,trubeauty001,The Tragedy That is John Carter,10,26 May 2012,"I'll admit, I was reluctant to see John Carter, I had never heard of the character and had only seen the trailer twice (which is more than a lot of people had seen of it, apparently.)It didn't look very sci-fi. I had thought that it would just be a waste of 2+ hours of my life. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie starts with an action sequence, followed by a long sequence that has the original author of the series (Edgar Rice Burroughs) receive news of John's death. From this the movie quickly picks up. There are a few comedic moments, but the movie is almost non-stop action and worthy of Burrough's writing. The tragedy, however, is the lack of faith in the movie. Out of all of the people I asked about the film, only one didn't like it (due to the type of fighting), but, despite the overall praise, there was a serious lack of marketing or even MENTION of the movie, as previously stated. Becauseof this movie, I have begun reading the stories and have found them exceptional. Unfortunately, there has been much bashing by people that have not even bothered seeing the movie, as well as the lack of faith in the movie from the studio, which has caused this amazing movie to become obscured into a fraction of its potential. That is the tragedy of John Carter.",John Carter
756,Bengalcat,A good overture for a sequel,10,9 March 2012,"Saw JC today. Here's a short and quick review. Migh contain spoilers. I know the books really well, and Stanton's changes did not bother me. They were logical and added meat to areas which Burroughs did not bother to plot, especially traversal between worlds and how it worked , which led to Matai Shang gang and their evil agenda. 9th ray was in the books. The storyline worked, it was very simple and clear so I do not get those critics who felt script was confusing. They must have been texting and tweeting or in toilet - or then maybe they have a really low IQ. The movie had a big momentum kick when Dejah and Mors fought over her wedding. Lynn Collins was great throughout the movie, powerful, talented and natural heroin. Kitsch was a little wooden at the beginning but got better and better towards the end. Carter had a really powerful moment fighting Warhoons - in the book there is a frequent mention of the ""famous fighting smile"" and Carters anger really delivered the same image, only via anger and hatred. Fights were short and a bit hard to follow because of the bad image quality of 3D (see below). Dialog introduced some things without leading audience (those who have not read the book) in to them, like Sola's history - it was just slammed there in 10 seconds. Overall script dialog and story flow was done well. There was some Pixarian slapstick going on in a subtle manner. CGI was really good. Woola was a slight disappointment in facial expression range, would have wanted to see him more! Carter's jumps were ridiculously long but then again you just have to get that this is not a documentary and the inner kid in me accepts these things. Barsoom looked good. Music worked really well and I found myself humming the catchy theme of Carter later. Sound effects were also good, they were well integrated to the world of Barsoom and sounded ""real"". The (very nicely done) end of the movie screams: we want a sequel! I hated the 3D. It made it look messy and dark - CGI looked sometimes like plastic miniatures because of it and action was hard to follow. We had also subtitles hanging on top of everything. I sometimes covered the other eye for 2D and immediately it looked so much more real and natural. I may be spoiled by Oppo Blu-ray player and a big high end screen at home but movies always disappoint me in image quality area. I'm very keen on getting Blu-ray of this movie. It felt shorter than 132 minutes. People seemed content and smiled after movie ended. I heard many say it was much better than they expected. About 60% of the audience were couples. Most of the audience was in 20- 50 range. I'm going to see it again on Sunday with kids. I give the movie 8/10, maybe 9/10 if it was in 2D. Was worth the wait.",John Carter

Suspense at the end was good but story seemed to be fragmented and loosely joined.

I liked it, my girlfriend liked it, and her 10 years old daughter was totally captivated by it.Im a big fan of the Berrowz and when the news of film making came, this one was on the list 'must watch'. And I'm glad i wasn't disappointed.Sure, there is quite a few director's freedom with the original book, and in my opinion, staying closer to the original and tossing out the scenarist additions (basically all introduction part) would benefit the movie, as would the increased time left of Carter adapting to Barsoom. And leaving second book theme of white Martians conspiracy for sequel.that was the greatest shortcoming - the time was too short to place all that book had to offer into a single movie.Liked lots of it - the settings, the views of dying Barsoom, and lots of martians. Both green and red. There was also enough joke tossed in, but it was nice, and didn't look dumb, like sometimes happen in Disney movies. Some American jokes only Americans get. It wasn't this time. Actions were a lot there.But - it was 2 hours that passed too fast. and in the end it was feeling 'oh, its already over'?

Just let me tell you, the film is very good.I didn't have the highest of expectations, but I was expecting something from the director of my favorite animation film Finding Nemo. Believe me, I wasn't disappointed.The film is meant to be grand, epic and dazzling. Boy does it do that well! The CGI is awesome, the Tharks (aliens) are very expressive and emote excellently. The battle scenes are grand (though could have been a little longer). The costuming is exotic, but not something out of this world. The scale and production design are brilliant. Taylor Kitsch does a good job as John Carter, and he's one guy to definitely watch out for later. Lynn Collins does very good, better than Kitsch, and brings the right emotions and hues to her character. Mark Strong has a surprisingly smaller role than expected, mainly because the villainy is split between him and Dominic West. But both did quite well. The others do well too. Woola is so cuddly and cute, and just too lovable, one of the most memorable bits of the film.The film does have some problems. The names are tough to pronounce in some cases. The 3D conversion is totally unnecessary; take my advice, DO NOT SEE THIS FILM IN 3D VERSION. You can have a far better viewing experience in 2D. The beginning of the film is a bit slow and not really great, though it does have light humor; the moment Carter arrives on Mars, its a hell of a ride all the way through.Trust me, this sin't a brainy piece of cinema. Its a bit of escapist entertainment that dazzles and makes you forget the world for over 2 hours (just like MI4). Contrary to some complaints, the film's plot is not very complex even for those who have not read the books, but you will have to be a bit attentive as the long names and the humor may take your mind off the story, confusing you.All in all, a definite watch in the theaters (Note AGAIN: in 2D).

Disney have NO one to blame but themselves.At the time (and in the few years prior) there was a rash of 'Real man' titled movies and they were all dramas or similar.Id be supervising ticket box and could see people staring up at the list/session times and they would dismiss 'John Carter' out of hand.If I was asked Id say what it was actually about, and they would most times choose it (and often come back and thank me after the session)Marketing 101 is making sure that the Title,Posters and other promotional materials do all the work. In this case it was all Contradictory and confusing.The initial posters (teasers) we got were simple and obscure....they told nothing, they sold nothing...and when the release posters arrived and they had this blank yellow font 'John Carter' and showed a guy on a giant animal....with 'Disney' above it....thats just more confusing.I always say that the  JC is down to just two missing words 'Of Mars'...that would have answered questions, peaked interest and gotten people curious.(just quietly another totally misjudged marketing campaign was 'Serenity' that was atrocious too.)",John Carter
764,robertvmaster,Terrible compositing and CGI.,1,24 March 2012,"Wow.I watched this and was constantly unimpressed with the CGI and compositing used in the action scenes. I was asked to go along and see it by a friend and I entered knowing nothing of the history and story of this character.I was always wondering what the hell was going on in this movie. The time-line is far too compressed and jumps around so fast it's not possible to follow or understand. It's sad to say, but this is probably the worst film I've ever seen. From the visual-effects being awful to watch, the story being so fast it could not be followed right through to the overall production quality, I can not rate this low enough.Feel free to disagree.",John Carter
765,theoblack1,A perfect film,10,19 March 2012,"I have not been this happy about seeing a movie in the theater since The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The story was great, it was exiting, romantic, funny, dramatic and powerful (The only thing I did not get was the main objective of the bad guys other than to ruin everyone's lives but I'm going to see it again). All the actors could really really act. The effects were Avatar good without the Avatar. The sound was Skywalker, Costumes were breathtaking and the directing was masterful. I usually just rent and if I have to own a movie I download it on itunes or buy a copy from blockbuster. This movie I will see in the theater two more times and I'm getting it on blu ray. It is a movie that needs to be seen in blu ray on in the theater. Seeing this on your phone would be wrong. I don't want to spoil anything and I won't but if you liked The Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie. Hell, if you like looking at stupid hot men and women you will like this movie. I loved it. All of it. I don't care that Disney made it. I loved it!",John Carter

We were enthralled from start to finish and I was shocked to realise how long we'd been sat in the cinema - a testament in itself. The characters are rich, the special effects are superb, and even though there are a few flaws in the story line they in no way detract from the splendour of this epic movie. The ending ties everything together neatly and I can only hope that we can expect more from the annals of John Carter. As a parent it was refreshing to watch something that gripped my attention as solidly as my kids instead of the normal fluff that is churned out these days. On a closing note, as the credits began to roll, my daughter glanced over at me with a fervent look in her eyes and declared: ""Let's watch it again!""",John Carter

No one else can fit this role better. This movie is based on 100 yr old novel from Edgar Rice but the way it is presented is really awesome. From actions to costume, humans to aliens, space ships to animals is all balanced and complimenting each other.Compared to other Sci Fi action movies like star wars or avatar sometimes you feel them fake or artificial but John carter seems to be more realistic and natural.

I must say, this is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It's an Avatar wannabe with cheesy dialog, cheesy acting, cheesy plot, and not one believable character.It's the perfect movie for the 11-13 year old crowd. But even for them it is easy too long, at least 30% of the scenes could be cut. And the 3D actually makes it worse, making what are supposed to be big epic scenes from a distance look like toy lands.The world traveling plot device is much to complex. The green aliens are a 6 limbed rip off of Avatar meets World of Warcraft Orcs. The humanoid aliens are not inventive with their blue blood and ridiculous red tattoos.The main actor may be the movie's only saving grace. In fact, I feel sorry for the actors with the horrible script they had to work with.The special effects team looks like they worked overtime to try and save this monstrosity.The one really likely character, a giant green 6 legged dog that runs faster than a bullet train, is not enough to waste your money on this flop.Someone was threatened by an usher to be ejected from the movie for having their cellphone on. I wish I'd been ejected so I could have saved myself the 2 hours wasted.The most amusing thing to hear, I kid you not, was the guy snoring next to me. Yes, snoring, at a 7pm movie, you can't make this up! The one kid this should have appealed to, the 2 or 3 year old behind us, didn't really care either.Don't waste one moment even considering this. The fight scenes and the ""You killed him with one punch"" garbage Wil make the guys wish they'd signed up to watch Steel Magnolias instead.Worst movie I've seen since Home Alone 3.People in the theater left making jokes like ""I'm John Carter of Uranus!"" That actually was said loud enough that the entire crowd laughed out loud. Instant sentiment poll. Good is subjective, but most people agreed, from their point of view, that it was at best, better than spending their night at miniature golf.In the parking lot, one woman had a ""Total Recall"" problem. She didn't have a freaking clue what the medallion was all about. Now, I did, but I never had the ""Total Recall"" problem.I went into this not knowing it was a series or anything. I'd have guessed some underpaid Disney intern pulled this completely out of their hat and got lucky that someone noticed the script and thought to actually make it a movie.",John Carter

The last movie I felt really good about was ""The Muppets"" and ""The Rise of The Planet of Apes"" and then now it is ""John Carter"".

To people who compare it with Star Wars and say ""This has all been done before, and better"" two points :(1) ""Done before"" : The books on which this film is based were written by Edgar Rice Burroughs (who also wrote the Tarzan books) 100 years ago. Most of the great sci-fi movies of the past 50 years were inspired by these books, not the other way around!(2) ""Done Better""? Really? Have you taken an objective look at the Star Wars movies since you were a kid? They are pretty average movies on the whole, but we forgive them for it because of the new world they created for us.John Carter is better than any of the Star Wars movies, the world it creates is more interesting - and the ending was SUPERB.",John Carter

The plot was ingenious and allowed curiosity to bring the guidelines and boundaries of reality to the near brink of fantasy in this sci-fi thriller! The movie's atmosphere is barren and open and allows ones mind to wander off into the desert. You find yourself in the shoes of John Carter, lost, confused, but hopelessly developed into the story line. The story took me about 10 minutes after the movie ended to truly get to why John Carter is John Carter, some may mistake this as confusing. Confusion is only the beginning in this movie but I believe confusion was used as the climax. The situation never seems to ever look good, and still at the end of the movie (spoiler alert) nobody knew if the good guys or bad guys won.Unlike Disney or pixar to break into such a risky ending but I found it to be a masterpiece! I call John Carter the best movie ever made, and by the end of the movie you will say, ""I have been to Mars."" Two Thumbs Up!!",John Carter
772,trloy2000,Different from the Book but very Good. Worth seeing!!!!,8,10 March 2012,I have been a fan of the books and comics for 30+ years and went in with high expectations. I must say I was not disappointed at all. I thought a great job was done on this movie. It did seem to combine some of the elements of the 1st two books with a bit of a twist. As a fan of the novels I really feel like Andrew Stanton did this film justice. The only reason I see this film not doing well as is the lack of advertising. Otherwise my wife and I really enjoyed this and hope there are plans for a second film. Visual effects were stunning as well. If not for the high cost of movies I would see this one again. This says a lot as I grew up in the era when you went to see a movie more than once. I would give this 2 thumbs up. Very pleasantly surprised!!!!! :),John Carter
773,bobcooke6,a boys own fantasy that literally springs to life,8,10 March 2012,"I loved Mars series as a kid, John Carter is a boys own fantasy that literally springs to life in a way even Burroughs could not have thought possible. Sure the fresh adaptation may make a few diehards raise an eyebrow..(no spoilers) but without these additives it just would not have worked as well as it does. To be honest I have been somewhat dismissive of 3D and rarely use it on my own screen, but this movie is one of those deserving and spectacular 3D events. A gritty western start leads our lad to a sci-fantasy adventure with a strong well paced narrative and visual feast that entertains non-stop! Art,costuming and spectacular effects will have to get gongs or there is no justice!",John Carter
774,markr6754,"Totally Enjoyable, Escapist Entertainment",10,10 March 2012,"I read the entire Mars series from Edgar Rice Burroughs as a new teen in the late 1960s. Having re-discovered the stories as e-books, I re-read them all over again 3 years ago. Needless to say, I couldn't wait for the opportunity to see this high-budget rendition of the first book A Princess of Mars. I began to worry as the early reviews came in from the ""experts"". After all, this hardly fits into the standard fare released from Disney studios.As an avid Burroughs fan I made it a priority to make this movie the first ever theatre visit on opening night. I wasn't disappointed. No need to say anything about the storyline, the plot, the acting, or the special effects. It's all already been said. I just wanted to add my voice, and my vote, to the tally of what I hope will become the first or many of the Mars series to come.....and then we can move on to Carson of Venus. But first things first. I was enthralled from the opening scene. It's probably the fastest 2+ hours I've ever spent in my life. I barely budged from my seat...including waiting through every second of the closing credits.Kudos, applause....already planning my next viewing....only this time I'll definitely spring for 3-D. Awesome. Thank you Disney. Do it again.",John Carter
775,theotherwhosmouses,"long-time fan says worth seeing in theater once, not twice",7,11 March 2012,"I read the John Carter books repeatedly when I was in elementary school in the 1970's and continue to pull them out a couple times a decade. I've read the best books in the series over 15 times; they were my Harry Potter. And Finding Nemo is one of my favorite movies, so I because very excited when I found that he was taking over this film. So I've been waiting anxiously for this movie for 2 years, or 30 years, depending on how you count.I don't think a single line of dialog from the original book 'A Prince Of Mars' made its way into the film. The director said publicly a year ago that he was deviating significantly from the book, so that's not a shock or a problem. Some of the changes were improvements, some were dumb, but his take on the story was a net plus. The spirit of the books makes it through -- except for Burrough's disturbing sexism, which thankfully was more than adequately expunged from the movie.What's surprising is how rushed the film was. For instance, in the book, the core romantic relationship evolves over several months. In the movie, it evolves over a matter of days. The characters' relationships would ring more true to the viewer if they were given more time -- and I mean story time, not screen time. I will be happy if someone releases a re-cut version on DVD: either the same length with less going on, or a mini-series length version with all the detail. I've read they took a LOT of extra footage, so maybe it's possible.P.S. If you're a fan who questioned the casting of Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris, don't. She is the best part of the film.",John Carter
776,ramanakumar-csv,100 year sci-fi fantasy comes to life !,7,11 March 2012,"I had read the novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs on John Carter several years ago, when I was in high school.'A Princess of Mars' was great fun, full of action, adventure, romance and elements of sci-fi. So I was really looking forward to see this movie. In recent years, advances in IT/special effects have made it possible to bring to life almost any character, any kind of story.I was not disappointed in one aspect : the movie faithfully recreates the sense of 'barbaric splendor-but in decay'. The 'Tharks' also come to life exactly as you would imagine. 'Woola' is a delight. Even the white apes look terrific. In Burroughs novels, we can be sure there's a lot more of fiction than science in 'science-fiction'. The movie is pretty much the same. This is not in itself a problem, because most of the hugely successful franchises in recent years are pure fantasy : Lord of Rings, Harry Potter etc. The ending is very different to the novel and some new elements and characters are there which are puzzling and not fully explained. The acting is pretty poor; again, Burroughs' characters are not particularly known for being highly emotive or articulate.One thing is certain : there's going to be a sequel. I urge the producers to use that opportunity to build in all the elements that were missing in the first movie : (1) a little more science to make 'suspension of disbelief' easier (2) a little emotion, drama and character in the main roles (3) as the main story line has already been tinkered with, pls go a little further and make it really good.(4) DO NOT CHANGE the settings, costumes, flying machines etc. in short, all the props are just fine.If you are in the mood for some light hearted fun, a 'Mars version' of good old Westerns, this movie fits the bill just fine. Don't expect more and you will not be disappointed.",John Carter
777,dbailey-314-217431,Great Action Movie with Excellent Plot,10,22 March 2012,"A lot of people have continued to critique this film by saying it wasn't done well and this or that. The film is nothing of the sort. It was nothing short of amazing. Though the acting was a little tough at the beginning it slowly cascades into an adventure that draws the viewer right into the plot. The action was incredible and mixed great with the special effects of the Martian World; which was created on key to the expectations of a dry planet. This is the type of film where a low-key actor such as Kitsch shines and shows the audience a firm acting job. Having a big named actor could have easily ruined this film. Also, Disney has been disappointing me for years now with book to movie remakes such as the Chronicles of Narnia but this film blew me away. I mean blew me away. Overall, ignore the critics and go see this film for yourself. You will definitely not regret it.",John Carter
778,bbprivateer,Great Movie! You can feel the grit of Martian Desert,10,11 March 2012,"Firstly, this movie certainly isn't a ground-breaker in terms of plot or special effects - although the special effects are amazing! What it does successfully is masterfully combining all the elements of the most legendary adventure & sci-films of all time: Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Avatar, Pirates Of The Carribbean, and Dune to bring us an edge of your seat piece of entertainment. While the main-plot itself is nothing new, in fact written nearly 100 years ago, the eye-popping visualizations, and unique plot twists make this movie a thrill-ride from start to finish. It certainly kept me engaged, and even though you know the good guys are going to win - there are enough plot twists and comedic interludes to keep you guessing as to what comes next. This film is a ""sleeper"" - in that from all the hype and outward appearances it may seem like a re-hash of old... but definitely it is much more than that, and is destined to be one of the ""greats"" and ""must see"" films of the year. There is no question, put John Carter 3D on your bucket list for things to do this Spring Break and you won't be disappointed!",John Carter

Now the good news: it's not Star Wars I -III, either.What it is is a faithful reinterpretation of A Princess of Mars, by Edgar Rice Burroughs. True, the plot has been streamlined, altered and, in some places, out right changed. And yet the important characters are well drawn. Tars Tarkas, Sola, Deja Thoris, Woola, and John Carter look and act like the characters in the novel. I found the special effects convincing and, in some cases, fun. I enjoyed watching John Carter jump. I loved Woola. The arena scene with the Great White Apes is clearly the film's centerpiece.Some people found the plot a bit confusing. I agree. The machinations of the holy therns lost me. Why not just turn the ninth ray on Helium and be done with it? But then silly sincerity of both the heroes and the villains in John Carter mimic the over drawn dramatics of Edgar Rice Burroughs novels.I read Princess of Mars over forty years ago and enjoyed seeing it on screen.",John Carter
780,chefchrislee,JCM was Great!,8,11 March 2012,"So I in some ways coerced my wife into joining me to see John Carter Imax 3d just to set the stage. My wife isn't a huge scifi fan she prefers movies that have the word ""poignant"" or ""touching"" somewhere in the title, and I love her nonetheless. I assured her that if the director at least followed the books she would enjoy the story. We got our 3-d glasses, seats, and cozied in for the ride. The movie started and though it wasn't to the ""letter"" in the book (which by the way would have been unnecessary) It was a GREAT movie. Those who comment on the lag in the middle must have worse ADD than myself. I felt the ""political"" fill in was perfect for creating a richer story. Does every action movie today need to be non-stop explosions, sex and blood? Does every action movie need to spoon feed the audience the story? To me and my sweet wife we would both agree that this was a fun, well-scripted, entertaining movie. There was action, romance, comic moments and plenty of thrills. The story written so long ago remained intact, I especially liked the director keeping ""Ned"" in the script. Awesome movie and a great date!",John Carter
781,taltos42,Well made adaptation of 100yr old 'Pulp' SciFi - Thumbs Up,8,12 March 2012,"I LOVED THIS FILM. Since I read 'Synthetic Men of Mars' as a teen I have waited for this to be rendered on film and I was not disappointed. It definitely follows the spirit of the story and setting. Sure there were some changes, but bear in mind this was written as 'PULP' Sci-Fi 100 years ago. To translate to our generation it HAD to have a little adaptation, and the writers did just fine. You immediately love John Carter from the very beginning and Lynn Collins as Deja-Thoris is both stunning and a powerful. She portrays the basic elements of the character while kicking ass with the best of them. I saw it in 3D (which I normally don't do as I feel it often derails the director from portraying the story). Movies that intentionally POP out at you are crass 'LOW' theater IMHO. In this case the film never made a point of letting you know it was 3D by simply enriching the background and lending it more realism through a better depth of field.﻿ The CG was VERY well done. I loved the Green men of Mars and forgot that they were entirely CG'd (which is the point). OK so the fact that the Red martians dressed a bit like Romans was a little obvious, but hey, I bought in fairly quickly so no prob really.In short this is a well done film worth seeing.",John Carter

I really hope it generates enough revenue to get a sequel or even a series of movies. I thought Taylor Kitsch did a great job...he reminds me of a young Timothy Olyphant and I am a big fan, so I mean it as a compliment. I would never let a critic dictate whether or not I see a movie. I think any kid who is old enough to see a Harry Potter movie could easily enjoy this movie. I am a 49 year old female, and enjoy things that entertain me and it certainly did that.",John Carter
783,chiliayotoo,Nope,5,12 March 2012,"I saw it opening weekend and believe me, this old fan-boy wanted to like it. It's not so much that the film has a Romans in space feel to it (what with the togas and the shiny helmets) but what seems to have been lost in all the reviews I've read is that the film is not faithful to Burroughs original novel. And by ""not faithful"" I mean it really went its own way. It has about as much connection to the original story as Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland had to Lewis Carroll's original novel. It's hard to understand why filmmakers feel the need to change a story so much, especially when the changes contribute nothing. Why not just invent your own story and save yourself the hassle? This film is likely to make fans of Burroughs classic sci-fi tale grind their teeth. It has some cool FX. But all the special effects in the world can't rescue a film that's unevenly paced with acting that wavers between engaged and adequate at best. The battle scenes are fun. The jumping sequences are over the top. Some work, some look pretty fakey. It's hard to know where they put all that $250 million. It feels like the film was rushed into production before a good script was ready. It's not altogether a terrible sci-fi film but in ten years it's going to look pretty stupid. Maybe if Stanton had stuck to Burroughs' original tale this film wouldn't be tottering on eight legs.",John Carter
784,parlanach-316-968798,"Much Better than Expected, But Still ...",6,12 March 2012,"I grew up with ER Burrough's books, and have seen some truly awful adaptations of them in film over the years. I'm very pleased to say that Disney-Pixar has made a tolerably good job of translating ""A Princess of Mars"" to the screen. The design elements of the movie are great: tharks, thoats, other Martian creatures; aerial ships of all sizes, cities, weapons, costumes, terrain and so on actually equalled or surpassed my expectations. The characters' appearance, dialogue and acting, or reacting, were more than satisfactory. Taylor Kitch (John Carter) has a suitable athleticism, and an admirable animation of facial features when facing what was for him, no doubt, a green screen. Lynn Collins (Dejah Thoris), likewise, was a credit to her character. No mere damsel in distress, she swings a sword with the best of them. Willem Dafoe's voice for Carter's friend, Tars Tarkas, suited the character well as did all the Thark voices.Then, why did I give only six out of ten to this seemingly wonderful work? Where Burrough's story is a yarn of adventure, romance, battle of good guys against bad guys, this has metaphysical undertones, and a nasty group of superior minds, the Therns, with its feet in two worlds, totally alien (pardon the pun) to his stories. This one addition, unnecessary and uncalled for, carries a great cost to the overall success of the film. It muddies the straight-line storytelling that Edgar Rice Burroughs was famous for. It will create difficulties in presenting the second novel, ""The Gods of Mars"", because of the way the Therns have been presented here.",John Carter

I haven't been as excited about a movie since the opening of Star Wars. The characters are all likable. The story is true to the John Carter books. The unique early 20th story telling and ideas and imagination of Mars for the period are fresh. I liked that the story assumes the watcher knows whats going on without having to explain too much and just let the movie guide the watcher on. Lots of fun and excitement without having current political ideals pop into the story. It is Edgar Rice Burroughs' epic tale come to the big screen...and its about time. My daughter and I are going back to see it again. I will get the Blu-ray version when it comes out. I got so excited I had to go look up Frank Franzetta's old art to compare to the movie...I highly recommend this film.,John Carter

Perhaps the best indication of that is the fact that, in spite of my supposed knowledge of and sensitivity to film structure -- I was taken by surprise when it ended and was in no way ready for it to end. Could the full two hours have gone by that fast? How?

However I will say that I am confident that I could eat the scripts to any 3 films ever written and sh*t out a more entertaining movie than John Carter. Every single person involved in making it should be deeply ashamed and spend the rest of their lives trying to make up for the horrific monster they have allowed to be shown to the world.

If you are looking for the Oscar performance of a lifetime from these actors, you wont get it here, but you will fall in love with both leads and you will really enjoy the great sub plots that keep you interested.Don't let the critics fool you!!

It's above all a story,and Stanton spends a little time explaining key points,and giving us insights into the complex characters-These are no caricatures in an all-action explosion fest (although there's plenty of action!)-There's a richness you don't always see in modern films and by the end I loved John Carter,Dejah Thoris and the rest,even though they were still surprising me. Only Star Wars and Avatar have created such an impression How critics can appreciate a film like The Muppets but try and sink this is a mystery.Maybe critics are very young and unimaginative?

John Carter leans on the side of entertainment over bloodthirsty battles. But that means that it is a great movie to bring your young teen kids to. John Carter is about finding hope when you think you cannot find it again. It is also about realizing the things in life that matter cannot be bought. Through all the adventures and confusion JC goes through on this strange planet, he surprisingly goes on a journey where he explores who and what he really is.

The beginning made absolutely no sense. I did not see the connection between the era of the 1800s and Mars. The beginning was overall unclear. Who was John Carter supposed to be? Why him? That was never explained, thus the rest of the movie failed to make sense. Moving on to the climax of the story, which also failed to make sense. There was no connection between the characters and the events that proceeded. There was no reason presented as to why they were on the planet, who they were, and how they left. Overall, one of the worst movies ever endured.",John Carter

Don't miss it on the big screen!An old fashion swashbuckling tribute to one of the most influential writers of pop culture of the 20th century! Apparently critics found themselves ill-prepared to follow a story that involves multiple faction vying for control of a planet. I did'nt.I have seen it twice. Enjoyed it more the second time. It is a very richly detailed film with plenty to take in.I am a huge fan of ERB and there are some changes from the source material but it is minor compared to the total amount used from the books.I don't see films to embrace secular humanist, existential dilemmas like most of the creative typists the newspapers employ as critics.

The female leads acting is unbearable... Her happiness, sadness or whatsoever were just in general bad. What bothered me the most is that many parts of the movie makes no sense. Carter has the power to kill one of the green guys with one blow but unable to shake loose a choke hold? With john carters muscle strength, no swords man should be able to even have contact with his swords without either damage on the swords or thrown far... and so on.

For those who have read the books we all know the characters in the movie are actually wearing more clothes than they did in the books. I feel that even though some liberties were taken with the storyline in the movie that are not in the book Disney did a fantastic job recreating this story. I am hoping for a sequel. Edgar Rice Burroughs was one of the main contributors to the scifi/ fantasy genre.

When you take into consideration that the book was written in 1912 they did an outstanding job of honoring the intention of the book and making it work in 2012 as a 3D movie. The 3D and creatures were very well done. Go see it, let it entertain you and have fun. Leave your critical mind at the door and then think of all the science fiction that has been influenced by a book written 100 years ago. I read the original series of books 35 years ago and am so glad they did not make this movie sooner. Some people think it is like other science fictions, of course it is for they were influenced by the original book! It left you with a good ending but they clearly can make the next in the series as well. You don't feel like it was 3 movies cut into thirds. I recommend seeing this movie and go to have fun. I will see it again while it is out in 3D.",John Carter
797,funkateer74,A good old pulp action adventure film with a sci-fi twist!,10,30 March 2012,"After reading the series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs (and would totally recommend them to anyone, especially the first three books), I was really looking forward to seeing this. The fact that at the helm is a director that actually knows how to tell a story put it in good stead. Even though the trailers do come across as a Star Wars/Avatar clone (and there's much more to the film than just the all-action sequences), and people are already lazily writing it off as such, but as the original book 'A Princess Of Mars' was first published 100 years ago, you can see after reading the book that George Lucas, James Cameron were definitely 'inspired' and mined the books for ideas (they've even said so in interviews themselves).Well, that day has at last arrived! John Carter is finally on the big screen, and I have to say, I loved it! From when we first see Barsoom and the aerial battle of the Zodangan and Heliumite airships, it really reminded me of the old swashbuckling movies I used to love and overall, director Andrew Stanton seems to have recaptured that old pulp action adventure spirit of the books. Yes, I wasn't expecting a true book-to-film adaptation, things were missing or changed from the book, but then again, it's always to be expected. Not everything will translate well from the page and your imagination to screen, not forgetting that the original source material is 100 years old too.I thought the leads played their parts pretty well, Taylor Kitsch did his job as Carter, and I was very impressed with Lynn Collins' Dejah Thoris (I think I'm in love!) and James Purefoy's Kantos Kan, even if his role was pretty brief! And Mark Strong, well, he's Mark Strong playing a bad guy, awesome as ever. I also liked the way the movie was bookended with the Edgar Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara) scenes.I really do hope we get to see the next film - 'The Gods Of Mars'. Forget the terrible (non-existent?) promotion and the slating from critics that just didn't get the premise of the film, it's so much better than it looks. Reviews that have been posted across the web have been very favourable about the film! So if you like a good old fun swashbuckling pulp action adventure, like the Sinbad films of old (or even the original Jason & The Argonauts or Raiders Of The Lost Ark perhaps), you should give this a watch! Recommended!",John Carter
798,seorasgloine,I liked 'John Carter'!,7,19 March 2012,"As one of the few people I know who has ever read the original John Carter books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, I have always hoped that some bold company would make a movie about this unknown long lost hero.John Carter of Mars was the very first action hero of what is now known as romantic space opera. ERB also wrote the much more famous Tarzan series (but John Carter is much better than Tarzan IMHO.) All fantasy and science fiction heroic adventure including Conan & Star Wars can trace their roots to John Carter of Mars. Classic science fiction writers like A.C.Clarke, Heinlein, & Bradbury cited Burrough's John Carter as inspiration for their works.I was very worried about the avalanche of negative reviews about the movie. But I & all my friends really liked the movie itself. I was very pleased to see that Disney was very truthful to the original source material of 'A Princess of Mars'. The action, special effects, plot, and music were all very evocative of ERB's wonderful novels.I think the reason why 'John Carter' did not connect with the majority of moviegoers was since John Carter is so old (100 years), that very few people, even nerds, have ever read the books. Very few people know anything at all about John Carter.Another reason is that since John Carter was the original action hero, every great fictional hero that came after him has already had a big budget movie made, for example: Conan, Flash Gordon, & others. This is why many critics have said after seeing John Carter, that 'they've seen all this before'.'John Carter' did not give audiences anything new precisely because it is so old. If the movie had come out 10-15 years ago, I believe it would have been far better received.So if you like grand, old space opera epics reminiscent of the 1950's, go see John Carter. And read ERB's John Carter books. ('A Princess of Mars' is free on amazon kindle.)",John Carter

Give it a go... I'm glad I did... I was thoroughly taken in by this film; and surely you will be as well.

Why this got such bad reviews in the media is a mystery to me. It had everything and more I could expect out of an adventure/fantasy/sci-fi movie. It's Pirates of the Caribean on Mars, but better.My concern is that Disney spent a lot of money on this movie and at this point the media is calling it a flop. This negative media will only cause less people to see the movie hence more of a flop. Go see this movie and I know you will agree.We need to prove the media wrong and make sure Disney continues this awesome series. SAVE MARS.",John Carter
801,davidjohnson65,This is one FANTASTIC movie!,8,21 March 2012,"I first read the John Carter of Mars series when I was in junior high school. This series really kicked off everything that followed for me from reading, to movies, to Dungeons and Dragons and wanting to do my own writing some day.To say that I was excited about the upcoming movie is an understatement.However, when the movie opened, I was disappointed when I started hearing the critics reviews and lack of money it made for opening weekend. What had they done to my movie? Of course, I had to see it for myself even if I was to be disappointed.Having now seen the movie, I have to ask myself if the critics saw the same movie I saw and should they consider another profession. This movie was awesome. Changes may have been made to fit the different form of media and available time, but this movie really captured what I liked and experienced when I read the books. The actors, creatures, ships, clothing, everything rocked! Ignore the critics and see this movie. Tell your friends to see it, your coworkers, your in laws, neighbors, the person sitting by you on the bus! When this comes out on DVD (Blue Ray, of course) I hope they have an extended version. I will buy it in a heartbeat.One last thing to say on this movie: I want a sequel!!!!",John Carter
802,scribenspuella,"Beautiful visuals and compelling characters, despite what the critics say",10,22 March 2012,"I loved this movie. Absolutely loved it. I loved the special effects, the CGI, the costumes, the plot, the score, and the acting, in particular the delightful Lynn Collins as the Princess Dejah Thoris).Now, let me qualify this by stating that when it comes to films and literature I am a very cynical person, and I am most definitely not a fan of any work by Edgar Rice Burroughs. I do think he is an interesting story teller, but his writing is god awful. ""A Princess of Mars"" is free on Google Books, and when I took a look, I found it was utter crap. Nevertheless, I went to the film because I like sci-fi in general. And in my experience sci-fi films are often more accessible than the books on which they are based.Now my only regret is that I have spent the week obsessing over the film instead of concentrating on my work. From the very second the film began until the moment the credits rolled, I was transfixed. I haven't felt that way since I saw ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Yes, that's right. I would put it on par with Star Wars. (Although, no it is not as good as ""The Empire Strikes Back.""I am utterly confounded by the reviews. And I normally agree with the reviewers! Even when I enjoy a film and the reviewers hate it, I can generally see where they're coming from. But in this instance I have to say that the reviews are utterly wrong.I saw the film in 3D on IMAX. Generally that gives me a headache, but in this case it did not. This is a film to see on the big screen. Go check it out before it's gone.",John Carter
803,mca0923,Great entertainment - the critics have this one wrong,9,22 March 2012,"The Martian characters were probably the highlight. The green skinned Tharks were great, as was the setting. You could probably see where most of the budget went, though speaking personally I can't say that the promotional budget of some $100million was well spent. Lots of people I've mentioned the film to have never even heard of it. The title is poor really - should have been something less anonymous - maybe 'Barsoom' for example after the name the inhabitants use for Mars. The dialogue might not have been as snappy and memorable as some might like, but perfectly serviceable for an action film. The acting was fine too - nothing like as bad as the critics would have you believe.Thoroughly enjoyed it - and this speaking as a huge fan of the original books.So take a chance, and make up your own mind.",John Carter

Even if you don't understand the plot you can at least appreciate the effort it took to create the visuals for this movie.Don't listen to the critics. Watch the movie for yourself.

806,eissfour,There is STILL HOPE for a sequel. Have faith and push!,10,24 March 2012,"This movie was a great representation of the original first book found in Edgar Rice Burroughs' eleven John Carter of Mars books. The simple fact that there is a movie of John Carter is amazing but the marketing of the film was horrendous. Now understand that there was stiff competition with The Lorax, Safe House, Act of Valor, 21 Jump Street, This Means War, and The Hunger Games because of their release dates being so close to John Cater's. These movies had either big name actors or proper marketing to build excitement for people to see them. John Carter did not. I, myself, was very excited to see this recreation of the epic novels ERB wrote ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO. That information alone is a great marketing campaign.Is it possible or better yet conceivable that a man 100 years prior could imagine future science fiction the way we do now? Or is it he who molded our view? He was the father who inspired the great writers and directors we know today. James Cameron, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Jane Goodall, and many more derived their ideas of space travel, flying, super- strength, etc. from ERB and this series. The idea of flight for ERB might possibly have came from the Wright Brothers who had achieved sustained flight not to long before these books were written. His great mind and incredible gift of writing inspired our beloved Star Wars, Avatar, Star Trek, Back to the Futures, Prince of Persia, Indiana Jones and many many more sci fi movies, NOT the other way around. Only the incompetent or unknowing would suggest that. And there is a lot of people that do not know about this series of books and that they were made LONG before any of the movies named earlier.Great marketing campaigns would also be to relaunch the books, make a trading card game, board game, or video game. Prince of Persia was a video game before the movie hit the Big Screen, and it had great success in all areas. Marketing the books with signings, and costume contests, with models and toys and collectibles would be one hell of a campaign. Star Wars did it, and it is still popular with 4 year old children today. Another solution would be to hire Big Name actors for the next film (i.e. Brad Pitt, Gerard Butler, Venessa Hudgens, anyone from Immortals, 300, 10,000 B.C., or The Last Air Bender, etc.). Even one actor would suffice. Let them fill a position as a new character that is introduced in the following book. Create some hype with them as the center of attention. orSpotlight Lynn Collins. She alone could pull crowds. Make her the focus of the sequel. Then when Thuvia and Carthoris enter the story bring in a Big Name actor to fill their shoes, hell, even a singer would work, Footloose made it happen. The key is marketing, don't let it fail again. DON'T let this be the last movie of John Carter. If an 18 year can muster up these ideas, imagine the power of a professional. Or a better professional than the one that had the job to market the film in the first place.A sequel is important! Let John Carter be the Star Wars for the kids of this age. It's only right since John Carter inspired Star Wars. Disney is a perfect host to make this happen. The 100 Year old books tell a great story, one that truly inspires. It would be a shame to not see this effort through to make a second movie. Let John Carter inspire our youth of today. Let it take them to different cultures, to space, and on an unforgettable adventure, like it has for me and many more, old and young. What is a better way to celebrate the 100th anniversary of genius, captured in book form, than to give a second shot at another movie? There is still promise and hope for success in John Carter. Have faith and take a risk. You WILL find out it is worth it.",John Carter

I saw it last week and was really overwhelmed. It's one of the best in his genre.The visuals are stunning, Andrew Stanton really proves what he's worth. And Taylor Kitsch puts down a brilliant performance. He gives so much depth to John Carter. He has a great flair that makes young and old believe his character. It's a brilliant adaptation of the Rice Burrough's books and I can't wait to see the sequel. Critics say it's a lame story but that is absolutely wrong.

I was thinking something like Lord of the Rings with maybe less Golum(scary) and more but toned down battles. Turns out it was chock-full of battle scenes. I mean chock-full. It basically starts with a battle/fight scene. They continue with 2-5 second intervals of confusion between. Sick yet? They last the whole movie, there in no love and the only companionship is battle companionship. Nonstop through the whole movie. I saw it yesterday and I am traumatized. I am so not joking. I'll admit I've never been in a fight but this movie would kill a four year old and would give a 9 y.o. PTSD. Sorry I had to say that.",John Carter
810,fshack,Flawed but worth seeing,7,26 March 2012,"Beautiful to look at and often thrilling, but bogged down by weak central characters. The movie begins and ends well, but the action on Mars suffers from poorly defined characters. I found myself continuously wondering what was motivating John Carter to act as he did. Some of this was answered as back story flashbacks, but it was not sufficient. Ultimately, his character came across as one dimensional and uninteresting. And the love story was likewise flat and not believable. The primary villain looked confusingly similar to his top generals and none of them were overly interesting as bad guys. The movie's premise was great, but the plot suffered as it was never made clear why I should root for one side or the other. What was at stake? Why should we care?Taken as a whole, I left the theater feeling entertained but with a nagging sense that this movie was a couple rewrites away from being great.",John Carter
811,tjslosson,Surprisingly good,9,26 March 2012,"I went to this movie looking for an ordinary action flick but what I got was a lot more. Overall it was a good story, good acting, with some surprises along the way, and the movie kept me interested from start to finish. Admittedly there were parts of the movie that reminded me of the star-wars prequels i.e. silly characters (like the dog) or hard characters being forced to do things that make them look silly but unlike star-wars these scenes didn't feel forced or out of place they felt genuinely like they belonged in the movie.I had one problem with one unexplained plot twist that needed to be explained or revamped but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.",John Carter

I expected more battle scenes, as that's what it appeared to be on the trailer when he was fighting these giant monsters. The only battle scene that they had was at the end which lasted for probably 2 minutes or so.The movie was very slow. they just kept on talking and talking which made it really boring. It just dragged! A lot of talk and no action at all. I fell asleep twice in the cinema.The only thing that I like with the movie is it was kind of funny.",John Carter

For those of us who grew up reading Elrich, Heinlein, Clarke, ERB among others, and watched westerns and Flash Gordon-type shows, it's a real treat because it hearkens back to an era when sci-fi and fantasy was intertwined.The special effects are just about right, not overtly trying to outdo Avatar but unique in their own right.

815,gary-333-45204,Awesome Film/ True to the character of the story,10,18 June 2013,"I have read the John Carter series over the years about 10 times, and would be most critical of a poor attempt to bring this masterpiece to the big screen. This movie is very faithful to plot points, with few exceptions which I won't elaborate on (no spoilers)... The attitude of the film's characters is almost perfect to the nature of Edgar Rice Burrough's intentions, and the actor's understand the depth of their characters, and really pull it off. There is great charisma between John Carter and Dejah Thoris, which is integral to the power of this story.The daunting task of creating this world of Barsoom (Mars) is beyond anything ever attempted on the big screen, and it is really convincing. The creatures are wonderfully brought to life, and the scenery is truly other-worldly. Burrough's imagination was off the charts, and this all is brought to life.The only drawbacks for me, are that the live action dramatic scenes are not edited with enough ""snap"", and I would have liked to see the final conflict scene become even more intense before it's conclusion. Because this is such a triumph to get so much of this story correct in attitude, I feel these drawbacks still do not pull it back from a ""10""!It is the next day, and it is still running through my imagination, and that for me is always a sign of a powerful film. I highly recommend seeing it, and am very supportive of a sequel, so long as they do not lower the production quality. That is essential... Don't mess it up with Hollywood short cuts and ""experts"" who think they know what the audience wants to see. The audience wants to know that you, the Story Teller knows how to tell your story, and they are delighted when you do that with confidence.Disney marketing ""experts"" changed this film to simply ""John Carter"" instead of ""John Carter of Mars"" - Diluting the film's power..., causing confusion, and severely hurting it's release... This is an example of people tampering with something they truly don't understand... Director Andrew Stanton knows this story, please let him continue telling it with dedication, detail & authority.Great Job.",John Carter
816,swemag,Watch it while you can!,9,3 April 2012,"I was a skeptic before as it didn't do to well in the US but boy was i pleasantly surprised. It didn't stray to much from the book and provided a first class epic cinema adventure with way way more heart and feeling than the likes of "" Prince of Persia"". A good script with humor, action and a story that makes you care. The acting is on par with the rest of them. The cinematography with it's 3D is excellent (although Mars isn't as spectacular as ""Pandora""). There must be a total f*** -up by the Disney marketing department for this to have failed in the US.

817,b-roxas14-334-105030,Under or over-hyped?,8,3 April 2012,"For me it was a little bit of both.For one, it had strong names behind the scenes but not too glossy actors in front of the camera. That's not to say that Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins didn't do a god job, they sure did! But something seemed to be amiss.Great Disney-style plot and cool special effects although not overdone. It's saddening that regardless of the money this film made at the box office, its still considered a flop because of the astounding production costs - not to mention an epic-fail of a marketing plan that was uber- expensive fr the movie's own cause.Here in the Philippines, if kitsch hadn't mistakenly claimed that he was extorted for an iPhone at our international airport (when the incident actually happened in Indonesia), I wouldn't have gotten much wind of the movie just by watching TV.Gong back to the movie, there were some point in it that I was wondering to myself if this was Avatar or Star Wars or Sherlock Holmes that I was watching. Some scenes looked eerily familiar with some spots of Planet of the Apes, or 10,000 B.C... I'm guessing that's mainly because I've watched too many sci-fi movies.Overall, it's a Disney classic... with an unexpected pleasant twist in the end.",John Carter

Could it be that some inner workings at Disney weren't prepared to cash out the money for a deserved sequel ? And therefore let it tank through bad marketing , publicity and press statements ? Because I left the theater with a smile and a desire to return to that planet as did John Carter. My compliments to the entire production team for this modern cartoonnovel !!(Afterthought : coming upon numerous good reviews from ordinary viewers all over the net , I wondered whether each bad critic out there saw the preview , was blown away , and decided not to go with the crowd as 'surely ' all other critiques would give it high marks ...So they all independently decided to ' stand out ' with some thoughtfully constructed bad remarks ...Its the only explanation apart from a conspiracy theory or collective occupational deformation ... )",John Carter
820,timppanen,"Enjoyable, but not perfect",9,10 March 2012,"So, as a fan of Burroughs I went to see this movie. The biggest problem is that it does not really follow the book, but on the other hand all the stuff in the movie appears in other Burroughs books.I didn't like the holy Therns, since they do not appear in the book ""A princess of Mars"" but then again they are apparently some kind of mix of Therns in ""Gods of Mars"" ans Lotharian therns from the book ""Thuvia, Maid of Mars"" a masters of suggestion, not a master of shape-shifting that X-men generation might misinterpret them.When looking this movie I could not wonder how much Lucas and Cameron stole from this story, Star wars stole so many words (Jed, Sith, Padwar, Banth, Woola and so on) + the idea of noble man fighting with sword even tho they have laser weapons, and saving princess + Tatooine desert and so on, it it obvious that Lucas read Burroughs, no matter how much he denies it, it would be the most unbelievable coincidence ever if he have come up with all of these without reading Burroughs.Stanton also makes one nice inside joke, he has taken one scene from a book ""Tarzan the untamed"", anyone who don't know could be fooled that this scene is copied from the original -76 Star wars movie. But the pictures shows that this is a part of Tarzan story, not John Carter.Anyway, the film is enjoyable, even when it does not follow the book. And it makes you wonder how little space-opera has changed in the last 100 years. After all, this film does not stole story lines from anyone else than Burroughs himself, and still there are many familiar themes. Someone stole from someone, but the criminal wasn't Burroughs or John Carter.",John Carter
821,apengineering,Waiting for the sequel,8,28 April 2012,"I've watched this film twice now and will a third time if I can find a 3D theater. The special effects alone make it worth while. For those still in doubt, read the book (available readily off the net) A Princess of Mars, and watch the film again. So much happens in the book it would be difficult to fit into two hours. Edgar Rice Burroughs is an excellent author, perhaps best known for his Tarzan books, and all his works are spellbinding. What the viewer may not pick up is the accuracy of the film relative to the book. Bearing in mind that the book was written in 1917, shortly after man's first flight, the author shows incredible foresight with technology. Whilst we are still developing anti-gravity machines, the Martian fliers are already equipped with GPS. Disney should pat themselves on the back for this one. The American market may not have taken an initial shine to it but the international scene made up for it. Not only am I waiting for the sequel, but they could easily make a dozen or more from the series.",John Carter
822,jeffrey-fouberg,I have read most of the previous reviews and find the negative ones difficult to understand,10,4 May 2012,"Aftet spending time reviewing the reviews, I felt I need to add something. Granted I will admit I was excited about the possibility of ""A Princess of Mars"" being turned into a movie, since I have been a John Carter of Mars Fan for many years. Prior to the release, I reread the first five novels, mostly due to trailers I viewed on Youtube. I wanted to refresh my memories of the original Burroughs stories. Enough boring background. I went to the movie, saw it in 3D at the local theater. Although characters were changed from the book and the story line changed, I loved the movie. I must admit, since I was a little boy, I have always loved Dejah Thoris. As far as the casting, I liked that the director used relatively unknowns, not big name stars. I was never bored during the movie, I found it easy to follow, exciting, visually breath-taking, it was Barsoom of my imagination. Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris was superb, it helps that she is a mix of martial artist and Shakespearean actress and the changes in her character from the novel fit well.As to the many negative reviews, I don't understand them, either many of the people do not read books, know little of history, or apparently do not care to think in a movie. This is the first installment of the trilogy of the series by Edgar Rice Burroughs. So naturally, it will end in a cliff hanger and be a blend of various genre in literature. Some have said it was boring, I again do not understand this, is all action, no clothing all they want? Very sad, this is an excellent story, very easy to follow if you suspend disbelief and want to enjoy a good story about a hero who finds himself in an alien world and is disheartened and looking for a reason to live again. If you were not familiar with the history of the story, then I can see why you may call it a rip off of previous science fiction movies, but that is ignorant on your part.Enough negativism on my part, first this is an epic movie, the cgi is not overdone to the story. The lead up to John Carter getting to Mars is well down and easy to follow. The acting is excellent for this type of genre. I go to many types of movies and this one really captured my heart. I have seen it five times in theaters and will definitely purchase the DVD. I really do not want to describe this film as you may want to see it and spoilers give away too much. I will close only to say that it is excellent, deserves the trilogy to be finished and I enjoyed as much as ""The Lord of The Rings"" trilogy if not more. It was easy to follow, most dialog was fine, the lead had a few ""corny"" lines but all in all it was a stunning movie. Again, I never seen movies more than once and never buy DVDs. Yet this one did not disappoint me at all. The negative raters obviously do not care for this type of entertainment. But if you like a beautiful princess and a hero and a cast of many, then you should love this movie.",John Carter
823,gorgeous47,"OK Movie Idea, Not Carried Out Well",5,6 May 2012,"John Carter had nice visual effects, OK acting, some good humor, and had an interesting idea behind it, but my family felt the final edit was incredibly stupid and disjointed. Parts of the movie were stressed that didn't end up having any affect on the plot. And even though it was a Disney sci-fi/action movie, the main girl (whose death we were rooting for) was always wearing about 2 square centimeters of clothing and constantly had her face 6 inches away from the (hero?). Gross! And weird things would happen, like someone would beat the hell out of the main character and all of the sudden he's best friends with them and is fighting a war for them. We all agree that the best character was an alien dog and that if everyone else was blown up the movie may have improved. Basically, when the movie was done we had no idea what we just saw but knew that we wanted an alien dog that acts like a lab.",John Carter
824,nicholashartman,A cult movie to be remembered,9,8 May 2012,"John Carter of Mars was an epic. A detailed story, written in a time when pulp fiction was a cultural phenomenon like today's epic superhero movies. This is not a wham bam in your face Avengers movie, but a grand epic with a tribute to one of the greatest American writers of his time: Edgar Rice Burroughs.Thank you Disney for your bold efforts. Sales might be the standard of today, but in the hearts of John Carter fans this was a great movie. Put to the screen with taste, class, and detail that will let this story live on. May your efforts be rewarded with continued sales as this movie finds its way toward cult status.",John Carter
825,mikepike-375-386429,Ohh it hurts...,3,20 May 2012,"***********Attention this review contains spoilers!!*****I can not understand how Disney could give the ""GO"" for this movie! It's like there was no person who read the script, it seems like the director made this movie for dumb audience, and here is why:The movie starts really good! The plot starts kinda old fashioned Disney like, the main char seems cool, the idea with the ""beam transport"" to a new planet is also very good. But then the stuipidty starts, when he tries to walk, he can only jump, seconds later he walks like handicapped person and then suddenly he walks like the boss, out of nowhere! Then he perfectly jumps distances he shouldn't be able to estimate. And the thing with the super power, he punches one of the green creatures with only one punch to death! Hello?! He seems incredibly strong, but later he is weak like a regula human, seconds later he kills thousands of aliens like a boss, seconds later he is weak like before... dear director/writer make a decision! Whats going on?! I feel fooled, only people who are dumb don't see this inconsistencies in the story line. One of the most stupid scenes was the wedding, john carter and the green aliens crashed the wedding, destroyed nearly the whole environment and then they thought, hey we have won you are dressed like you'd like to marry... lets marry, NOW ... OK. What a pity, this movie had some really good approaches it could have been a really good movie, with some very nice special effects, but why the hell did no one with BRAIN read the storyboard ?!",John Carter

Well I plan on watching it at least 10 more times!!!I now plan to read all the books this was based on, as i haven't felt this excited about a film since well I don't know.I am still in shock at how kick ass this film was...

Put this into context your civilization if complex enough to invent flying spaceships but not that complex that they use 'swords' to defend themselves in battle,ridiculous. Please guys I urge you to not waste your time on this 'film'. After finishing this film all I could remember is the people in the cinema walking out quietly probably thinking 'what just happened?' normally at the end of a good film people are buzzing and chatting about the film from the moment they leave the theater but this film..well it seemed like a funeral.Oh and btw guys its pretty obvious people at Disney are writing phony reviews about the film, anyone who is sane and has an IQ above 80 would know this film sucks.",John Carter

I bet the people who said that its not easy to follow are probably those that find avatar, star wars or harry potter to be equally hard to follow. I would really like to see more, even though domestically it did not make as much, internationally this film made quite a lot of money in the box office. I believe it did not go well because Disney's advertisements for this movie is quite bad and uninteresting. I did not even heard of this movie until I saw it in bluray. If you still haven't seen this movie you should go and rent it. You wont regret it.",John Carter
830,rupsie3,A thrilling story with humor.,8,5 June 2012,"First i like to say you this: ignore the whole John Carter trailer. It depicts John Carter as a uber-super human with no background why he can do it.This was my first reaction to the trailer. After a friend persuaded me to watch i was baffled by the beauty of this movie.The movie feels to me very similar to Prince of Persia Sands of time movie (for those who know it). Excellent decor, good music, decent dialog and action with humor here and there. Also its the little gestures in the movie that makes it funny to see. If you are looking for a movie that keeps you on your seat then i would recommend you this movie.",John Carter

I not knew history John Carter. but the story should continue, perhaps the advertising approach was wrong. But I would like to see a continuation of the film and learn more about the Terns.I think we're tired of hearing the same story about Mars colonization repeat repeat etc. .. Interesting new approach using more fiction. I hope that Disney reconsider. The first may have been a loss. But maybe you can recover in the second. Running the risk? And fantasize over the story using the time difference between the two worlds between Earth and Mars to make the plot more interesting, using it as the alleged visits to Earth to search for signs of life outside earth. I do not know. The story could win a new direction.",John Carter
832,abkarchcraigs,Simply an enjoyable movie,9,7 June 2012,"Let me start off by saying i have never in fact read the books.This is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable Sci-fi movies i have ever seen. John Carter is likable from the start, although he has noticeable character flaws, which help the story progress.I have read reviews saying that this movie is based off such a predictable Disney formula, which is utterly ridiculous seeing that this movie was based (and from a few differences I've read it was not really stupidly far off) off of a series of books. Plus, tell me a movie that uses the ""Disney formula"" that has a twist that big at the end.Anyway, the story was quite easy to follow. That's saying something, because I'm a 16 year old teenager, and everyone knows teenagers have the attention span of a dog. So anyone who says the plot is difficult to follow either is not very smart or didn't actually watch the movie the whole way through. You get a really good introduction to the story and a pretty clear view of John Carter's background. It shows quirky flashbacks to his family that shroud his behavior in a sense of mystery, which becomes more clear as the story progresses. its not over dramatic, with that flat out awesome dog providing some comic relief, although the story isn't too serious to begin with. You have the rather cheesy romance that might be shown a little too much, although you really get the feel that the characters like each other.I am giving it a 9 out of 10 as opposed to a perfect score for a few small reasons. Taylor Kitsch did a pretty good job, but he really seemed out of it at some points. Its apparent hes not a very good actor, However, it really does not distract from the expanse and vastness of the movie. The other obvious flaw is that the movie cost three times as much to make as it should have.And i might add that the special effects ARE fantastic. Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. they should not have cost over 200 million dollars, but that is not exactly the fault of the director, its the fault of whoever he put in charge of that.People are comparing this to avatar in terms of story and special effects. Its really not fair to do so for special effects. They got everything right in one go in Avatar and it took, what, three times in John Carter (which I'm willing to bet would not happen again in a sequel).As for the story, I personally found Carter a much more enjoyable story to watch. There's something about Avatar that bothers me. (And its not the rock being called ""unobtainium"".)It really is not half as enjoyable to watch in my opinion. Maybe its because you don't find out which side you are supposed to be rooting for until half way through the movie, after you have spent the first half being introduced to the wrong side. Then when you are familiar with the good side, you really aren't introduced to a whole lot of characters you want to like, at all, as there are several characters who often insult and hate on the main character. I guess I feel its a sci-fi movie that Cameron took too seriously.John Carter on Mars is a great example on a movie (although not so much on how to make one). You have a good character with a solid background, noticeable (though not really as immoral as you would find in most modern movies) flaws, there's a romance, drama, comic relief, a really smooth plot (regardless of what you would be led to believe), which all tie together quite well. In my opinion, John carter is more a superhero than many of those you would find in comic books.",John Carter

834,weberma1,Is it possible all professional movie critics are Therns?,10,14 June 2012,"The movie is epic. It hits so many different levels. War. Romance. Religion. Elitism. Planetary survival. Each one woven together with seriousness and a dash of wit. While the original covers of the ERB books were dramatic and exciting, Andrew Stanton's John Carter will forever put faces on the some of science fiction's greatest heroes - John Carter and Dejah Thoris. Ever since the first ""Shining"" movie I found director/writers can't stick to the original script. This adaptation brings a nice update to the plot that keeps you wondering if it's going to end like it does in the book. I love Stanton's comment in the DVD directors narration about why they picked Lynn Collins for ""the most beautiful woman on Mars"" as she was called in the book. He wanted a middle aged man's version of Dajah Thoris and not a 10 year old boy's. They chose well. He made Dajah a very strong character who was stunning, cunning, tender and not bad with a sword. The civil war references to John Carter were a nice touch to deepen the character. They book had almost no explanation of how he got to Barsoom. Stanton adds some nice details here as well. Mixing female solders with the rest of the guards was interesting. The fan trailer on you-tube is much better then the Disney trailers. The Disney trailers were all about sword fighting and jumping. ""Princess of Mars"" is about one of the greatest romances in science fiction. I wasn't sure it was ERB's John Carter until someone who had seen the movie told me. Of course it had been a couple years (decades?) since I read the books. So here are my complaints: -Didn't stay in the theaters long enough for me to see it twice. -Where are the action figures? Mattel and Hasbro what is wrong with you? Dajah Barbie. Need I say more. I say this because of the 5 yr old few seats down from me did a lot hooting and hollowing during some of the scenes. -Where are the replica John Carter Swords? You think you've seen one sword (or a thousand as in ""Lord of the Rings"")you've seen them all. The Martian swords were great. Similar to some of the art work from the books. Apparently Disney let their entire marketing department go in the crash of 2009. Definitely nobody there now. -Ditto for the helmets and armor. -Movie Critics. Really. Speaking of 10 yr old boys. ""Too much CGI"". ""Not enough CGI"" ""Stiff performances"" ""No Chemistry between Kitsch and Collins"" Really? You want trite and under thought commentary - read the critic reviews. They appear to be disappointed in not having enough gratuitous sex and violence. This was after all a Disney film. A hero's journey through a strange land. Beautiful women in beautiful costumes and romance not sex. No pandering of cutting off parts of Tharks, Red Martians, Warhoons or Great White Apes. Well, maybe a little pandering on the Warhoons. So this brings me to my summary. Maybe Professional movie critics are Therns trying to destroy the Earth by keeping us from watching the really Great Movies. PS. I've renamed my dog ""Woola"". If you haven't guessed it yet, I liked the movie.",John Carter
835,regeya-399-696714,Surprisingly good,8,17 June 2012,"I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was. I watched it because of positive reviews, despite being put off by how badly the movie tanked, and the potential silliness of a sci-fi fantasy story based on Mars (I admit, other than getting partway through The Chessmen of Mars, I'm not familiar with the Barsoom series.) The editing was a little rough, and I knock it down a little because I didn't expect a rough movie from the guy who brought us Wall-E, but there it is.If you watch it and are tempted to compare it to Star Wars, remember that the story was inspiration for Star Wars. It has the potential to become a cult classic (yes, really!) Hopefully this director will get ample chance to redeem himself later.",John Carter

837,warnerve82,Not a Science Fiction fan???,9,23 June 2012,"It seriously does not matter. I am not a big SciFi fan either... I had heard that this movie got terrible ratings, but now I realize that it was the poor marketing of Disney or whatever dismal company they may have hired to get the word out. I can only hope that the sales of DVD's (one of while will be mine) will overshadow the film's heartbreaking box office sales. I rented it from RedBox because I already knew the story (I read it as a child and loved it for its adventure and of course... the LOVE... I am a girl after all) and had REALLY wanted to see it. I, unfortunately, cannot afford the rising prices at the movie theatres. From the commercials and posters, you would believe that the entire movie is about John Carter fighting aliens on Mars. A complete movie for the Science Fiction buff... and many thought it could never measure up to the films of George Lucas (although this story is what gave G.L. his inspiration, in case you did not know). There is really no alluding to the love story between Dejah and John, how it progresses from distrust to partnership, nor is there is any hint of the sadness John experienced here on Earth to cause him to lose faith in the good fight. There were so many things left out of the trailers that I was genuinely surprised at what the film actually entailed. The movie had many depths. It tells of the hatred of two different cities and of a very different species to that of the people of the cities. It also follows a storyline for our hero, his anger and angst for the world and willingness to fight anyone to get into his way, why he had spiraled to the depths of anger and sadness, explanation of where John is from and how he got to Mars, confusion to the new world he experiences, distrust of all those around him, the refusal to immerse himself in a fight that does eventually become his own because of a beautiful woman that has just the same amount of fight in her... and even the twist that nearly rips your heart out the end is strong and nearly floored me... but they fix it, I PROMISE. I am sure I have said too much already... I am very sorry for that. I think that if ANY of those things had been even HINTED at in the trailer, more would have paid the blood the box offices require to see the film. I believe that John Carter is owed its due and even if you are not an avid fan of science fiction, I think you will at least like this film. I, not being the biggest science fiction fan, LOVED it (it will remind you what is like to look into the eyes of that one person you love and know that you would cross, miles, oceans, and even planets to get to them).",John Carter

Saw it in the budget theater without knowing it was on DVD, my wife informed at the movie that it was, we went and got the DVD and watched it again. I hope there is a part 2, 3, etc..The movie is clean of foul language, very little blood. The acting for me was just fine, I only dislike over acting, the cgi looked good, both in 3D and 2D. The last 3D movie was kind of hard on my eyes, (Journey to the Center of the Earth), this wasn't. I will probably watch it again this sometime this week as TV these days just doesn't have much to watch. It's a shame there aren't more movies like this.",John Carter

I couldn't understand why it had got a bad rep, it was great. The love story was well developed as well. You could slowly see it develop on her side and the backstory of his own loss of a previous with was shown well. I liked how one battle was intercut with his memories of his most painful loss, he used his pain to give him strength to fight the battle. The tech such as the flyers was truly beautiful and original looking. The cgi of the thaks looked good and solid, at no point did they feel cartoon like they had great personalitys and sense of humor that worked well.

The effects are sterling, the character arc is one of the best, and the alternation between action and dialog is 5 stars. Unless someone is a jealous hater, this is a definite must see.This film is very congruent. The interface between digitally rendered animals and human like beings is the best so far. It is an epic tale that Joseph Campbell would love. It is even better the second time. I really liked Avatar as most of the world did, yet even with Avatar, there could be legitimate suggestions.

It is the perfect amount of action and adventure for a SciFi movie with endearing characters and a story line that draws you in. Taylor Kitsch was a genius hero well matched by Lynn Collins. Supporting actors William DeFoe, Dominic West, and James Purefoy were wonderful. Every detail was attended to from the landscape to clothing and tattoos. I wanted to step into this world.

The sci-fi elements are exciting to see. The adventure unravels in such coherent and heart touching manner that you immediately relate to the characters and are invested in their lives.Taylor Kitsch is a handsome, charming, and disarming leading man whose mixture of rogue and soft heart can't help but win you over. Lynn Collins is an exotic beauty with strength, passion, and provocative spice that encapsulates what one would expect of a Princess of Mars.The chemistry between these two has you rooting for them to get together and win the entire film.

There's been plenty of discussion as to Disney's failed marketing, but my belief is that the company simply overestimated public recognition (and appreciation) of ERB's classic series. Personally I only became aware of the movie's release by reading a critic's middling review. The disappointment for me is the likelihood of no sequel, or at least a sequel with the same leads. For all its wonderful, cutting edge effects, the chemistry that developed between the two stars left me saddened that no ten year reunion will be experienced. Lynn Collins in particular, should be given credit for creating a modern, dynamic but still eminently female characterization.",John Carter

I spent several years in the Military and read all of Barsoom Series while stationed overseas. A big fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs and thought they would never be able to match what my imagination had envisioned. I was wrong, the people and creatures where grander than I thought they could be. The cites, landscapes and scope of the effects was just short of perfect. Leave it to say, My Wife and I enjoyed it immensely.She did not appreciate it as much as I did because she did not know the story and if anything was slightly weak it was the story, but it's hard to shove a whole book into a 2 hour movie. I think I enjoyed it so much more because it took me back to a great time in my life, reading a great author and I sincerely hope it is not the only one, I hope for more.",John Carter
845,johnni-427-539049,Well worth seeing.,9,19 July 2012,"Having only just seen this movie, which I looked forward to, being a huge fan of the books (I had them all) ... all I can say is ... I enjoyed it immensely. Yes there were a few slack moments and the script could have been tighter ... but Andrew Stanton did a great job in bringing John Carter of Mars to vibrant life. The cast's only weakness lay in the Jeddak of Zodanga, but the as- always excellent Mark Strong is there to crank up the villainy. I don't know how it got such a bad review, but any film with actors of the calibre of Ciaran Hinds and Jemes Purefoy, demands another look! I hope the producers will brush off the reviewers and make the next movie ... and go bigger and better with the FX. In short ... the film delivered the goods!",John Carter

847,ihearthugs,"Great graphics, cheesy but interesting plot",8,12 August 2012,"This movie surpassed my expectations as I'd read that it was a big flop. I'm not sure how Disney managed to make it a box office flop because it is a much better movie than some other movies that have gotten great ratings (i.e. Twilight series).The plot was pretty good, the action was great, the graphics were great, the characters were a bit cheesy, but likable and interesting. The plot was especially cheesy at parts, but overall interesting. I was hoping for a sequel to it, but since the first movie flopped, I doubt Disney will make another one :( Good thing they didn't leave you hanging at the end of the movie and made it a conclusive, but expandable ending, at least.Give it a try. If you're a fan of the sci-fi genre, I think you won't be disappointed.",John Carter

For me, it's such a good movie, i've bought it on Blue Ray. It'll sit along side great films and collections ranging from Battlestar Galatica to Stargate to The new episodes of star wars and Dune..Put aside the retentive ""but the moons don't go right.."" and some minor sexist attire and attitudes, it's laughable that anyone would object to whats there.

850,laurent-daudelin-484-358078,A great opportunity lost,1,28 June 2016,"Well, like many people said here, whoever wrote the scenario never read the books from Edgar Rice Burroughs. That's the main problem and why so many people found that movie convoluted.Frankly, Disney lost a great opportunity to start a new franchise with the possibility of many more movies. Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote 11 books about John Carter. They were all exceedingly good.But the scenarists and the director decided to remake the whole story. They picked tiny bits here and there from the book to assemble them into a big mess. That's why there are so many things incomprehensible. That's why the story seems so disjointed. That's why you have those cheesy dialogs. Which results in bad acting.If at least their re-imagined story had been good. Clearly no talent for writing. Why not follow the books more closely? I will never understand who at Disney gave the green light and had no oversight over where this was going. It's no surprise that this movie wasted 250 millions.It was not an impossible task. Peter Jackson did an admirable job at transposing the Lord of the Rings story into many compelling movies. Why couldn't Andrew Stanton do the same?Very sad to see one of the earliest book I read and loved being trashed like this.",John Carter
851,ragewolf-530-122063,Tragically underrated,9,16 November 2012,"Ignore the poor reviews, and the folks who say the positive reviews are fake and planted/Astroturf, etc. As a fan of the books, and someone who has waited 40 years for this movie, I think it's great. Does it stray from the source material? Sure. Does it gloss over plot points that would have helped a viewer who hadn't read the books, understand the plot better? Yes, and that's why I didn't give it a 10. Stanton, the director, is an admitted fan-boy of the novels. This is not a criticism, I also fit that description. However, there are points where I understood the motivations of the characters, but my wife (who never read the novels) had to figure them out from later plot points in the movie. The culture of the Tharks, Woola's instant bond with John Carter, all make more sense in the novels. -Though the scene where Carter is unwilling to let the Tharks abuse Woola, I found very poignant. Stanton might have not seen the forest for the trees on a few occasions, and that's the shortcoming that keeps me from giving it a perfect score. Another criticism I see is that there are obvious changes from the novel. I'd heard this before seeing the movie, and being the admitted fan-boy I was furious and nearly refused to see it. I can gladly say now that the changes make sense within the mythology of the John Carter novels. It's almost beautiful how Stanton pulled it off. Compared to the changes in the Harry Potter films from the books, the multiple directors at least had a living author to confer with, and ""run their ideas past"". Stanton had no such luxury, but you'd swear he must have contacted old ERB's spirit with a medium and hashed out the details. The changes do work that well. As a final testament to the movie, I bought John Carter on Blue Ray and brought my wide screen TV and player over to my Grandfather's house. He's a World War 2 veteran and read the books when HE was young. Parts of the film visibly moved him, and I was surprised. When I asked him why, he said ""all these years I've only seen this in my head. I finally get to see Tars Tarkas and John Carter meet."" I had to agree.",John Carter

None-the-less, he sat down and watched it with me and then both of us went out and purchased Blu ray copies. This movie is incredible and if sequels are made, my son and I will be in the front of the line to buy them. I've been an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy since childhood and I've amassed a collection of well over a thousand books. You name it and its probably in my collection. There are a number of books in the John Carter series and I'd watch them all. Gads how can people criticize the John Carter movie?

854,goldenmitre,A beautiful tribute to Edgar Rice Burroughs...For REAL Fantasy Lovers,10,12 January 2013,"It truly baffles me why so many people - particularly so-called movie critics - utterly condemned this movie when it was released in cinemas. And the level of ridiculous, emotional slurs it seemed to invoke in some has only led me to believe this past year, that some strange agenda was at play OTHER than ethical practices, in some of these reviews.Please believe me when I tell you that this is a beautifully crafted film and worth every moment of viewing. If you are a genuine lover of: * Fantasy /SciFi * SciFi Classics * Adventure * Evocative visuals, then this must be added to your viewing experience. The movie has effectively brought the vision of Edgar Rice Burroughs to life and when I first saw it, left me dreaming about ""Barsoom"" for months on end!Don't listen to all the ""nay-sayers"", fantasy/SciFi- or Disney-hating critics and internet trolls.

The special effects simply add to the visuals of an already outstanding film and do it a greater justice by enhancing it.I too am hoping for and look forward to a sequel based on The Gods of Mars.

The movie is based on the novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs ""A Princess of Mars."" It is part of his ""Barsoom"" series which is what he calls the planet Mars. I know some people have given some unfavorable reviews. More than likely, they were expecting a science fiction movie like Stars Wars or something like that. I really think it is not. To me is a an action adventure movie with some romance. In my opinion John Carter is a different hero, he does't have super natural powers, that makes him more human. I'm really looking forward for a sequel.",John Carter
857,richardmdeangelis-651-686362,100 years in the making worth the wait,10,4 March 2014,"One of my favorite movies in nearly 50 years of film-watching. Since first catching John Carter on Starz a few months ago, and then buying the Blu-ray, I have watched this movie at least a half dozen times, growing more captivated by it with each viewing. It is a great adventure, lovingly made, beautifully realized, and full of the action and romance of the pulp stories that inspired it. Based on the 1912 story by Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, who is considered the grandfather of American science fiction, directors and studios have struggled throughout the last century to bring this epic tale to the big screen. Everything from Flash Gordon, to Star Wars to Avatar was directly inspired or influenced by John Carter's escapades on Mars (or Barsoom as it's called by the natives), but it wasn't until the once science fiction setting of 2011 that computer technology finally caught up to Burroughs' prolific imagination, making it possible to bring his amazing otherworldly cities, creatures and flying ships to vivid life.As breathtaking and essential to the story as the special effects are, it was Academy Award-winner Andrew Stanton's direction, and the performances of the cast (including the CGI ones) that made me fall in love with this movie. For me, the heart of the film is the impossible yet destined romance between wayward Virginia cavalryman John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) and his literal star-crossed lover, the Martian princess, scientist and swordswoman, Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). The performances of and chemistry between Kitsch and Collins are so convincing I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. And the thousands of green-skinned, nine-foot-tall, four-armed Martian Tharks who make up most of the supporting cast are just as convincing, even though they exist entirely as digital pixels. The only thing that kept me from believing that they were real is the knowledge that they can't be, and the motion-captured performances of the major Thark actors (Willem DaFoe, Thomas Haden Church, Samantha Morton and Polly Walker) convey as much emotion and character as any of their corporeal co-stars. This also goes for Woola, the Martian dog-like callot, who quickly becomes Carter's faithful best friend and protector.My only criticism of the movie is the five minute prologue, which I feel takes away from the wonder of Carter's initial Martian journey as it was presented by Burroughs (to rectify this, I recommend starting the movie from scene two, which is when the opening title credit appears). It was mainly for this reason that I was going to give John Carter only nine stars, until I realized that the last five minutes--which I consider one of the greatest movie endings in film history--totally offsets the deficit of the awkward beginning.Regrettably, I missed John Carter when it was in theaters, having been unduly influenced by undeservedly negative reviews from members of the film industry press who deemed the movie a critical and financial failure--almost entirely as a result of Disney's incomprehensible and incompetent marketing decisions (such as dropping ""of Mars"" from the title) and false reports of skyrocketing production costs (for more on Disney's marketing debacle, read Michael D. Sellers' excellent exposé, John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood).Fortunately, John Carter has found a second life and a growing fan following through people viewing it on television, computer and tablet, who are as mystified as I am at how so many critics could fail to appreciate this movie's many charms. Hopefully, as more and more people give this film the chance it deserves, that fan following will eventually reach a critical mass, and those of us who didn't make it last time will get a second opportunity to see Barsoom on the big screen in a John Carter sequel.",John Carter
858,wareagleus,Barsoom BOOM,10,6 May 2013,"How everyone hasn't seen this movie yet is beyond me. Kitsch is fantastic as a true southern man from Virginia and adequately captures John Carter, almost perfectly. Lynn Collins is the beautiful Deja Thoris and is a bad ass fighter to boot. Here's hoping to a sequel that's long overdue!!! Disney!!!!! Edgar Rice Burroughs truly was a great and story teller with a great imagination. Considering what was known about Mars at time seemed to have a downright exceptional spot on take of Mars. Good see James Purefoy outside of a Knights Tale and as Joe in Fox's The Following. All the negative said about Kitsch's acting and emotion are pure hogwash. Definitely 5 stars 10/10 movie watching.",John Carter

John Carter is based on a classic novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, whose highly imaginative adventures served as inspiration for many filmmakers, both past and present. The film tells the story of war-weary, former military captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch), who is inexplicably transported to Mars where he becomes reluctantly embroiled in a conflict of epic proportions amongst the inhabitants of the planet, including Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and the captivating Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). In a world on the brink of collapse, Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes that the survival of Barsoom and its people rests in his hands........The movie was enjoyable with loads of action & adventure. There was so many hilarious moments in the film. Overall it is a good movie, I don't know why there are so many critics about it.It do deserve some praise and in my opinion the movie was so much better than the novel.My favorite scenes were: >The learning to walk scene >Carter's grooming along with the young Martians >Woola will follow you >The ending scene and etc.Source : http://novelstheywroteormoviestheymade.blogspot.com/2013/02/john -carter.html",John Carter
860,blake1001,Not worth the 100 year wait.,10,7 March 2012,"I saw a sneak preview of 'John Carter' last night. I had mixed reactions to it for two reasons. One, predictably for a geek who read these books when he was ten, was, of course, that they changed some stuff.The other is that I think they waited too long to make it, but I'll get back to that.They changed things from little to fairly major.The red men are white (OK, a bit tanned) with red tattoos - and portrayed mostly by quite white actors. That makes some of the dialog ridiculous. John Carter is supposed to be quite obviously alien to the green and red men. It's absurd that Tars Tarkas doesn't take him for an oddly-un-tattooed (perhaps a pariah of some sort?) red man, and laughable that red men compare him to a white ape. They needed to be outside the range of human coloration for a human to seem truly alien to them. Not sufficiently faithful to the original, and it hurts the story.The fliers, OTOH, were an interesting spin. The whole '8th ray' thing has to seem pretty absurd to 21st century audiences. Even in 1912 it was a little weird, riffing off the work of Newton's 7-color spectrum, even though infrared and ultraviolet light had been discovered a century before. Having martian flier 'sail on light' was a fair twist on the untenable 8th ray, and, though I heartily miss the aether-science of tanks of rays providing lift, I have to admit it's nothing a modern audience uninitiated into the Barsoomian cannon could have swallowed. And the designs were quite nice - ERBs original fliers were just floating boat hulls, really, and that's, again, not going to impress jaded modern viewers. Not faithful, but not a problem.That said, let's talk about the Therns. From misguided false priests & cannibals to techno-magicians and planet eaters is just a bit too much. Plus, basing their freaky nanotech on the 9th ray? Really? If you're keeping the 9th ray (which in the books, was just used in the atmosphere factory), why ditch the 8th? Why do the Therns need to be shape-shifting nigh-omnipotent boogeymen instead of mere conspirators? It introduces some monstrous plot-holes, too, since the abilities the Therns are given make it hard to fathom who they could fail to gank Dejah Thoris in the 10 years they have while Carter is on earth.Finally, there's the river of Iss. It's supposed to be /really/ long, and lead to a verdant valley, not a couple of blocks to a stone tree. There was really no need to try to weave that bit of the Gods of Mars into the first movie, and they've really curtailed what they can do with the second by dissing the Iss....now, on to it being too late. For the longest time no one was willing to try to make A Princess of Mars, because it was just deemed unfilmable. The common wisdom is clearly that Avatar proved it could be done. Well, unfortunately I think LotR proved it could be done, and Avatar made it passé. I'm talking about the technology, art and audience expectations. Post-LotR, Barsoom would have been awesome, no 3-D required. Really, the masses of green men were the only thing that technically couldn't have been done even earlier. Imagine Harryhausen or O'Brien doing the White Ape, for instance. The martian landscape doesn't call for 3d and cgi, it's sand, stone, canals and ruins. Matte paintings were up to the task. Numerous desert locations in California, alone, were up to it.But, it's worse than that, because John Carter fails to capture Barsoom, in spite of having more technology than is needed. Thoats are supposed to have yellow feet and be sleek and glossy, instead, they're dun, dusty and warty. The green men are supposed to be /green,/ they're olive drab at best. The whole movie is just a blah sepia palette, there's no way audiences dazzled by Avatar are going to be wowed by it. The moment when Barsoom could have made a splash on the big screen has simply passed.Too late, Disney, you should have done it with cell animation decades ago.",John Carter
861,rapierchecksix,Best version of the story ever done!,10,10 March 2012,"Having waited the best part of a half century for a version of ERB's Barsoomian series to be worthy of the name, this latest version by Andrew Stanton hits the nail on the head.Every movie necessarily changes stories to make them fit the screen and meet time formats. What Stanton is done is to capture the heart and soul of what made ERB's world sing and made it memorable for a century, not by slavishly following the course of one or another of the books, or by violating the ""laws"" of its universe, but by re-translating it and making it work for ""now"".What shines forth from the story is nobleness and baseness of human nature, the spiritual center of all of ERB's work. This is the theater of the mythic center of our being, the center that transcends the rationality and ultimately mundane ""real"" world that time forces us to live in.Take a bit of your mundane time and step up on a broader stage.

At first I thought that it will involve rocket of some sort with some weapons and lasers, so I watch it. After several minute, I found out that that is not the case. It was something... different. There are 2 factions fighting together, with a neutral faction, and the man got stuck here because of he grab something from a killed invisible man. And then he do superhuman feats because of the reduced gravity.

If you have not seen this movie you need to do yourself a favor and watch this.

Interesting new approach using more fiction. I hope that Disney reconsider. The first may have been a loss. But maybe you can recover in the second. Running the risk?

My biggest disappointment in the film was the over use of key plot points of the sequel books. I am very against the introduction and heavy reliance on Matai Shang as a main character in this arc of the story.

Honestly, I watched this movie because my friend loves it and now I think I need to re-evaluate our friendship. John Carter is garbage.I wish I understood the plot points, why John Carter was being chased, why he needed beans, when did his wife and child died, how the hell his nephew is the kid from spy kids, why did he still wear his wedding ring, why didn't the British Martian princess care that he might be married, why the green aliens killed their children and how did all the eggs get to that one location, was it a giant orgy?

874,alexsmith0218,The End left me shaken.....,10,3 May 2014,"OK I went into this thinking I've only seen this Guy in Battleship and that was decent, but that was SCI-FI, I'm not the guy that's into fantasy cinema, and that's what John Carter came over as; I just remembered a trailer with the guy just jumping around, I was like man gimme a break I'm not watching this. But lo and behold....when the movie ended I was really shaken. Why was I shaken because I remembered things to look for and to read in between the lines when watching, learning anything. It triggered something to make me even write this review. Mainly memory, which immediately began sending messages in the forms of questions, and answers, to the many topics I think about naturally, like from space to culture. It had a lot of quiet symbolism that I felt if discovered, rings louder than the town bell. It draws you in. From start to finish but it doesn't move to fast as to I mean it doesn't force ideas of what its trying to do but It lets you patiently develop them over time as the movie plays out. it lets you get to know the characters really well and their motives ambitions strengths and weaknesses.I loved the cast. I loved every part of it. Its been a while since I've seen such an original piece.Nice work Disney with supporting this I knew you guys wouldn't go wrong. Really good movie.",John Carter
875,nray-996-349624,Good Movie,7,8 May 2014,"I just purchased and watched this movie. At the time it came out I knew nothing of the history of the author or the books. When I saw the previews it looked like just another big blockbuster movie about big armies fighting each other etc, that were occurring the years before it came out. So, I was not interested. Then I saw all of the negative reviews about the movie. Anyway, after reading about the history of the story, I realized I had misjudged the film and decided to buy it. I thought it was great. I judged at a 7 out of 10. It was entertaining and had a good story. It was nothing like what all the negative reviews had given it. It is definitely not a stinker. And....it had me wanting a second movie.",John Carter
876,cowan-camron,Outstanding!,10,19 June 2014,"The initial reviews of this movie were way off base. This can be seen over the last 2 years as reviews have turned positive. I won't speculate as to why the reviews were bad, but I will say that advertising was non existent for this movie.John Carter is the embodiment of Walt Disney. I've always seen Disney as a company that aspires to bring out and reinvent the wonder in children and adults alike. Disney has done it with this film adaptation of A Princess of Mars (1917) by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The best part of this movie was leaving the theater listening to my kids rant and rave about how awesome it was and hear their speculations of what will happen next to John Carter.If you were duped by the poor reviews at the initial release of this movie, I'd suggest you give it a watch. The initial reaction of critics and the lack of advertising for this film is the only reason for it's poor box office success. This can be seen by the overwhelming positive reviews it has received after hitting DVD and Blu Ray.",John Carter
877,ms-mehabadi,just my opinion!,1,22 June 2014,congrats! I've just finished wasting my time watching this! and I have to admit this movie is just the worst!! :) I mean how predictable a movie can be?! and it's not the only weak point! OK let's see: 1- there is no logic or any kind of scientific explanation or any reason for anything that happens. OH MY GOD!! what's 9th ray??!! you obviously can see that the story doesn't follow any human logic. the director and ... just wanted to make their story by any mean! 2- awful play!! can a character BE more dummy??!! 3- everything just appears from nowhere! for instance that scene which the dog comes and rescue john carter by crushing that controlling blue totally out-of-nowhere bracelet!! I mean come on What's that??! and finally i don't wanna bother you by making this a long list!! but at the end there is another things and it's the final part of the movie which everything could just end how they are but no!! that guy has to appear somehow and send back john to the earth!! and so on... and as I said it's just the WORST...!,John Carter
878,home-91,Great movie!,10,28 June 2012,"This movie bombed for one reason bad marketing.What needed to be promoted in particular was the history of this story. Every sci-fi movie of the 20th/21st century worth it's weight took from this narrative in some way. It's the granddaddy of adventure sci-fi. Without that exposure a lot of people will see it as merely derivative of the likes of Star Wars, Avatar et al. George Lucas owes his career to the series of books this movie is based on.This movie isn't perfect but compared to the drivel being passed off for great cinema today it's much better. Avatar was way over-hyped and you'll notice the main thing Cameron is selling Avatar on is the digital green screen techniques, not the plotting.SUPPORT A SEQUEL!!!",John Carter
879,m-chahine,Unexpectedly Awesome,10,13 October 2018,"After hearing very little about this film except for maybe some bad reviews, I had very low expectations.It turned out to be a revelation to a fantastic story that doesn't take itself too seriously, and loveable characters. It almost feels like one of the original Star Wars movies mixed with guardians of the galaxy with all the ridiculousness of both these movies. It is unfortunate that the film didn't do well there will be no sequels. I had never heard of the books before but am inspired to read them now.I think the only problem with this film was its marketing!Overall very enjoyable!",John Carter
880,lisamach,Always enjoyable,9,4 August 2019,This film is most enjoyable. I don't know why it was such a loss to Disney. Perhaps a television series would be better for the sequels.It's a fun fantasy adventure.,John Carter
881,themeowcrafter,Just for homework......,7,22 June 2015,"I just watched John Carter10 minutes ago because I had forgotten there was a 素晴らしい for a long time. But, I watched it today because there's a movie review waiting me to write. You may ask me why. This is because of our teacher – D.B. told us to do The movie is made by Disney which is adapt by 《A Princess of Mars》. This is a story about when America was having civil war. An officer John Carter was taken to Mars by a magic stone. Because of the gravity is different with Earth, he become a supper man with had infinite power and could jumped very high. But, he was drawn into a fight of different ethnics. And he met a lot of ally such like Jeddak and the princess Dega Solis. All of the ethnics thought that Carter is the hero which can save the Mars. But, something unbelievable happened which he was thrown back to Earth by Szabo Zane This movie is filled with amazing actors who act like not humans (some of them may be computer made). First,Willem Dafoegives a legendary (I'm loving in using legendary science I start to play LOL) performance in this film and is absolutely hilarious. He acted an alien and he give Carter a name called DotarSojat (which means my arms) after he saw his supper jumping skills. Taylor Kitsch as the male lead acted hardly because he had to Duang~ to jump that high and throw things which are heavy. Finally, the character Una was made by computer but it was also good for a lot of laughs throughout the film, even though it was playing a supporting role. The casting for this movie was truly perfect, and the actors won't disappoint. But one of the boring things about this movie was that the story was so boring. Even Chinese movies had better stories design than this movie. But the scene of the faces and the expression of the actor seem naturally. It was like that they are not acting the story. They are in the story. But it's still boring because in the first 30 minutes, the scene on the Mars was beautiful. But the rest of the part of the movie, the male lead was bellicosing his superpowers that made it didn't add more stories or a thing that our history teacher always told us a turning point. It wasn't a good thing to said this was a good movie just for the scene. Finally, I love how in this film just when everything seems to finally be going right, Carter was thrown back to Earth so that the story can continue. But it ended with a pop end just like tomorrow's land. But I can't tell you the details.Because I don't want to be a spoiler. Overall, this is a great movie with a mix of a ton of laughs and a love story all rolled into one. If you're looking for fiction war or a movie just to goof and laugh, try this movie. But it may not be that funny as a comedy.",John Carter
882,giantlittledog,Good with average parts,6,26 October 2015,"I thought it was a good action movie, good casting of characters. I feel that it's getting much more ridicule than it deserves, yes it didn't make the 260 million that it cost to make the movie. Why it cost that much to make in the first place I don't know. And what good action movie doesn't have a few cheesy lines with a love interest that could possibly use a little more depth. The only big flaws I can see are in the plot not revealing enough about this magic sand and what ever happened to the bad guys aka the Thern? He didn't beat them, they're still out there being evil and stuff. Also, a little more rounding up at the end would've been nice. It's almost like they're gearing up for a sequel, which judging by the cost to make just this movie won't be coming any time soon, and if it does, won't have the same characters",John Carter
883,downer84,A total bore.,2,23 May 2012,"I really didn't know what to expect before seeing this movie, as I had never heard of this movie before. I therefore didn't have any high nor low expectations. Let's just say I had an open mind when I watched this movie, OK?This movie is really, really boring. The characters are really not believable, the acting and the dialouges are really forced, and there are A LOT of Jar Jar Binks' running around. Yes, the CGI is good - but there no amount of cool CGI can weigh up for the lousy story of this movie.I can honestly say that this was the worst movie I've seen in many years. I want these two hours of my life back!",John Carter
884,ginginlynn,loved it,10,22 December 2015,not only did our whole family love this movie we cant Wait to see the second one! We purchased this movie twice!( the first one was borrowed by a friend and they loved it so much we gave it to them and got us a new one. with extras!) Hope to see more!!! The character were spot on and the casting of the character's was great. I would hate to see them change actors since Disney will not be making number two. The scenery was extraordinary! as well as the graphics. I can not wait till my children are old enough to read the books. this was a great serious. we recommend this movie to all our friends and family. the story brings back the best of my childhood and i am glade to be able to share these story's with my children.,John Carter
885,kaenna1,I can't understand why critics call this movie a flop?,7,13 March 2012,"John Carter was surprisingly better than I expected. If someone calls this Avatar-lite, that might be because Avatar is in fact somewhat based on the Barsoom novels by E.R. Burroughs. There were a few issues with stock characterization, but it has a great, multi-layered plot, good graphics, and more than decent action sequences. One thing that I did not like, was the pointless 3D conversion. Completely unnecessary means of getting more money from patrons as it did not add anything. There is a lot that is left unanswered in the film, and it's a good thing. Watching the film left me asking ""Why?"" but out of curiosity, not frustration. You leave the theater wanting more of that rich, adventure-filled world. Made me want to read the books.",John Carter
886,klausschroiff,Outstanding movie,10,29 January 2016,"Honestly I don't get it why the critics killed this movie. Over the years I probably watched it 5 times and I'm still enjoying it. The story line is deep for a SciFi movie, pretty good actors, lots of action & love, great special effects. What more could you ask for (in this genre)? A few weeks back I watched Star Wars VII. Harmless story - essentially an updated version of the first movie and the critics loved it. The difference in quality between Star Wars VII and John Carter is nothing short of dramatic. So what did the critics smoke at the time? I just hope that somebody will be bold enough for a sequel - after all Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote several John Carter books.",John Carter
887,treker-11983,Definitely a 10 / 10,10,1 May 2016,"When I first saw John Carter Of Mars advertised, I knew it was going to be a movie that would have the kind of impact that the Lord Of The Rings Movies did.Due to it only having had a short run in the theaters here, I didn't get to see it until it came out on Blu-Ray.I am a 59 year old father of three grown up children and I have seen countless movies in my lifetime.I would definitely rate John Carter Of Mars in the top 5 movies I have seen, of all time. To me it is an outstanding movie that has everything in a sci-fi / adventure / romance movie, that would be appealing, to all age groups over 15. I find it very difficult to understand why it got such a bad rating by the critics when it was released. But then, half of these so called movie critics wouldn't know a good movie, even if it jumped up and bit them on the bum.I was never a huge fan of the Star Wars movies, but I did enjoy them.When the new one was released, I thought it might be worth going to the movies to see it. I did so and when I walked out at the end, I only felt disappointment and I was left with the impression that they only made it to cash in on the franchise. After reading some of the reviews and ratings for that one, it just confirmed how I feel about movie critics.John Carter Of Mars definitely deserves at least 2 or 3 sequels because it is such an incredible adventure and there is so much more of the story to tell. If they have the same great cast, use the same director and are marketed the right way, they could easily be a runaway success.",John Carter

889,jsamc,why did it flop at the box office ????,8,21 April 2012,I love 3D Movies and scifi so JC was a no brainer for me. Loved the movie.I guess the thought of an invisible organization manipulating leaders is to much for the average movie goer.The sets were great the costumes were awesome . It was a Cecil B. Demille grand scale epic.Its too bad this movie didn't make its money back because there will never be a sequel Maybe they should have titled this movie the princess of mars.Word of mouth and buzz usually helps promote a movie. John Carter got neither. So apparently the average movie goer didn't like the plot of this movie or it had too many subtitles in the beginning.Clearly movies that aren't straight entertainment i.e makes you think cannot be blockbusters.,John Carter
890,robertnieboer,Brilliant realization of a childhood favorite series of books,10,14 August 2016,"I have seen this movie in my head thousands of times over the last 50+ years. I think I've read just about every Edgar Rice Burroughs book multiple times. My two favorite series were of course Tarzan and the John Carter Mars books (and spinoffs).I guess I might have been pre-disposed to liking this movie. It was with a great deal of anticipation that I sat down to watch it. I was not disappointed. It's such a great story, told well, played well, shot well and directed by somebody who loved the story.The story comes from the fertile imagination of Burroughs. Is it a bit cliché? Yes. Are the characters a little black and white and predictable? Yes. Is this still a highly enjoyable retelling of a story more than 100 years old? You bet!How this wasn't a blockbuster at the movies is beyond me. Maybe people are right that the trailer sucked and the marketing poorly executed, but the word of mouth should have got this movies across the line and created huge buzz.I've been hoping for a sequel but it looks unlikely given the $250+M budget of the original.Loved it. Absolutely loved this movies. The cast were fantastic as was the CGI. Please do a sequel somebody!!!",John Carter
891,hpdanemma,Such a surprise!,9,9 August 2012,"I saw this film with very low expectations as the marketing of it in Sydney has been quite terrible. At best, I was expecting a stupid Gladiator-esque movie focused solely on violent action scenes. Instead I got a sensitive, deeply thought out world and plot made up of likable characters and amazing cgi. Yes, the plot was a bit lame but come on - it's Disney! I was just so impressed with the directing and screenplay and it had been far too long since I'd seen an interesting adventure film. Bad aspects of this film include some slightly unrealistic plot devices as well as some stiff acting from Kitsch...however I truly believe these were eclipsed by everything else, particularly the depth of the world, the pace of the film and the quality directing. I would highly recommend John Carter if you are looking for a fun adventure film and can get past the initial shock of the sci-fi storyline. Loved it!",John Carter
892,antfarrell,"Grand, classic and fun adventure!",10,20 March 2012,"The lukewarm reviews of the movie I've read here and there are inexplicable to me - I find it hard to imagine a better translation of the source material to the big screen. I truly feel that to dislike this film, you must dislike the genre as such. The movie is fun, it's grand, it's well casted, well directed and visually amazing.Given that the movie has - almost officially - been declared a flop, we probably will not get a second installment in what could have become a great franchise. Fortunately, the movie is self contained (though still with all kinds of possibilities open), and does not as such need a follow up. So if we only get this one, at least we get a good sense of closure for the characters.With better marketing and perhaps some more reviewers not afraid to speak up for adventurous escapism, this movie - in my view - could very well have become the Star Wars for a new generation. I for one am going to see it again (and buy it on Blu-ray).",John Carter
893,anhmanh,Excellent movie!,10,7 March 2017,"I love this movie. It makes me feel like i am there on Mars(Barsoom). I loved every bit of it. It has a nostalgic feeling to it like i was watching stargate or avatar. I really hope they make a sequel cause the ending left a cliff hanger. I wanted to see what happened next when John went back to Barsoom. God, i want a sequel so bad. 2 thumps up for me.",John Carter

This movie was spectacular. It had amazing action and special effects, humor, romance, and drama - you name it. The characters had depth and development, the story was great, the action and special effects were some of the best I've seen and I was even very impressed with the acting (something I didn't expect from the preview, but the acting was wonderful). It is honestly the best movie I've seen this year, and it's no wonder. It was created by Pixar and it's every bit worthy of their library and legacy.Unfortunately, it's not making enough at the box office to recoup its huge budget because of a lousy marketing campaign and bogus rumors before it was ever released. Please don't blindly listen to this flop nonsense that started before anyone even ever saw the movie. See it for yourself or at least talk to someone who has seen it! Look at the IMDb score! Without the negative pre-release press that influenced sheep, that score would be much higher too! This is an excellent film that deserves your money. I highly recommend John Carter and think any fan of this type of movie owes it to themselves to see it.",John Carter

898,sherryizadi,Fantastic and loving adaption of a highly visionary book,8,21 March 2012,"I saw this film after having read several of the books by chance a few months ago and was extremely excited when I heard that they were to be made into a film. I went to see the film yesterday despite the critics' reviews and must say that I was absolutely amazed. The film had succeeded in translating the book to the screen and several points that were ambiguous in the book had even become clarified. The special effects were incredible and John Stanton had done an excellent job of bringing Edgar Rice-Burroughs' Martian landscapes and visions to the screen. I have no idea why this film was slammed by critics. It is a highly enjoyable visual experience and one that has obviously been made with love and dedication. If you are a science fiction fan and also love big budget 3D action, please go and see this film. Ignore the critics and listen to your heart. It is well worth the ticket money, particularly in Imax 3D. I only wish a sequel could be in the works.",John Carter

Its better to watch the movie in 2D rather than 3D.The entire movie has a brown theme added to it,may be its because of the vast dry land.They should have added some more color to it,Come on it not like Tarsem Singh movie(The Fall) where you need to select different location for each frame,its CGI you just get a fantasy world in you mind and you build it.Its easy for me to say but It would have been better.If you are a Star wars fan then its a great flick if not its just another blockbuster with high budget CGI.John carter is like Superman on Mars.",John Carter
900,chassii,wow,5,8 June 2012,"Just from the previews I can see that someone failed to read the books before writing the screen play. If you are a fan of the written series this movie is not for you unless u can separate the classic from the new wave type movie, (We who have know that the Therns (the bald guys, by the way did u forget that they literally refused to appear in public with out their yellow wigs) were not in league with the green men of mars and did not show up till the second book) Deja Thoris was definitely warlike in her beliefs it was just that women were not warriors on Mars. There were many times where she felt puzzled by Carters compassion for her enemies when he allowed them to live and the book explains it by reminding the reader that Barsoom is dieing and to let an enemy live was a waste of the dwindling resources. While I did enjoy the movie I can tell you one important fact before watching it yourself : This is not John Carter of Mars, this a a movie based on the series but it is not the series. its a shame because with the special effects today they could have actually gotten it right. and yes I realize movies don't follow a book to the ""t"" but usually they stick to it better than this.I will give it a 8 for the movie but as for following a classic tale written by a master.....well lets just say u got the names right and most of the animals but as for the story line you failed miserably.",John Carter

As it is the print promotion would be quite confusing to the uninformed -- and not enticing enough to get then to try to leave that state.(By the way a movie poster that replicated the first frame in the movie that showed Deja Thoris would have had teen boys rushing the theater, not to mention buying copies of the poster).It has action, adventure, humor, horses (and alien horses), a feisty (and beautiful) princess, a faithful animal sidekick, an evil empire, an alien conspiracy, a tinge of romance, gladiatorial combat, swords, advanced-science, flying ships, personal fliers, glorious sets and scenery.See it in the theater. See it again. Buy the Extended Edition Blu-Ray when it comes out.It does not adhere 100% to the original story, but the departures are relatively minor and do not significantly deviate from the feel of the novel.I may have to return to this review in a few weeks to edit the title by replacing the second clause with, ""the first movie I have seen three times in a theater"" (or perhaps more than three times).",John Carter

Firstly, I'd prefer this one before Star Wars (SW) any day. However, as mentioned in the other reviews the trailers are quite unrepresentative and do not really represent the movie at all. Subsequently, the script could at times be more intelligent and you can see that some scenes are inspired by SW ""the clone wars"". However, this is what Disney should be all about. Even me that hated lord of the rings, Star Wars episode 3 and Avatar thought this one actually did the job. CGI is among one of the best I seen even better than the prequel SW movies and, yes you guessed right, Avatar. I even would like to see a sequel obviously Stanton knows what he is doing and there are still eleven books to go in the series.MY MESSAGE IS THIS: THE TRAILER IS BAD, THE MOVIE IS GREAT, SEE IT IN D-BOX 3D AND I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. And for all the haters, if you liked avatar and thought that was a good movie, than I do not see how you can hate this movie with good consciousness. All the best,",John Carter

If we could leave all negativity aside when these movies hit theaters and let the fans decide through work of mouth I'm thinking these would do better.

Three quarters of the way thru I realized I did not want it to end! The Princess was very 'hot'. The 'dog' was very cute and the 'aliens' were extremely well crafted and believable. Other than that I can't think of specifically why it should have worked so much better than most sci-fi, action, fantasy films. It might have been that I watched it on DVD on my 23"" computer screen?

ERB is one of the all time greatest Sci Fi writers to ever grace us with his remarkable story-telling talent and no mistake!This movie, and I would like this opportunity the express my warm and heartfelt gratitude to Disney for making this project a reality, has everything one could possibly want in an entertaining, believable, captivating movie.

Certainly not the mess that critics would have had you believe.While it isn't as good as the book (What is?), it stands alone well on it's own merits. There are no exceedingly slow parts, the acting is decent and the special effects were substantial. The only question to me is how well the special effects will hold up over time. The ""space dog"" is great. By far the best part of the movie.The movie is certainly better than anything Lucas did with Episodes 1-3. Negatives? There was an emphasis on special effects that could have been probably handled better with different direction. The cinematography was sometimes too crisp, too well defined, the roughness around the edges made the CGI stand out even more. Granted I'm watching the movie four-five years after it was filmed, but things have changed.",John Carter
