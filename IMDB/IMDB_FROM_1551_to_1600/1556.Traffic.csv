0,MartinHafer,A very complex plot that all boils down to one thing...futility.,10,30 November 2012,"""Traffic"" is a VERY complex film--one with many different plots occurring all over the United States and Mexico. What makes this very unusual is that many of the plots are NOT clearly interconnected. So, what one group of characters do in Cincinnati or San Diego might have nothing directly to do with folks in Mexico or DC--at least not until later in the film. Indirectly, though, they are all part of the drug trafficking world as well as the war on drugs. Together, these many different stories all paint a very, very grim picture--a picture of futility about our government's attempts to get a handle on the illegal drug trade. Because of the fine craftsmanship in making the film, you can't help but be pulled into their message that what we are doing now simply isn't working. Clearly, the film is trying to make a political statement. And, if you don't believe its message, you sure will have your thinking challenged. And, you have to respect what this film has accomplished.""Traffic"" earned four Oscars and I can see why it won so many awards. However, one of them left me baffled. While Benicio Del Toro did a good job in the film (I have no complaints at all about his acting), I marvel that he received the Best Actor award simply because this film has no star--just lots and lots and lots of vignettes with lots and lots of actors. If I saw the film and had to identify the star of ""Traffic"" without knowing about the Oscar win, I would have no idea who THE star was. I might think it was Del Toro or Michael Douglas or Don Cheadle. I know it's not done, but it sure would have been nice to have given an award to the entire cast.",Traffic
1,Leofwine_draca,A movie that demands to be seen,6,20 November 2016,"Another good production from director Steven Soderbergh, whose work needs to introduction here. This epic of a movie tells you all you really need to know about the drug culture in American and Mexico without preaching or relying on plot exposition: instead it puts you in the thick of the action by getting you involved in the lives of a number of characters.The plot is complex and demands close attention, as half a dozen different story lines converge and drift throughout the movie as each moves towards its relative conclusion. But Soderbergh has hit a winning formula, with his combination of technical expertise (never has a film looked so realistic) and outstanding performances from an ensemble cast, with every actor and actress acting so well that they live and inhabit the role. A strong movie which, despite its sometimes shocking and distressing subject matter, has to be seen.",Traffic
2,SnoopyStyle,great work all around,8,3 June 2015,"In Mexico, state police officers Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and Sanchez catches a truck full of drugs. However General Salazar stops them and confiscates the drugs. Salazar gets Rodriguez to capture Obregón brothers cartel assassin Francisco Flores.In the US, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is a tough-on-drugs Ohio Supreme Court judge. He is appointed to head the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy as the drug czar. His straight-A student daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) falls into doing harder and harder drugs with her boyfriend Seth.In San Diego, undercover DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzmán) catch dealer Eduardo Ruiz and turns him against drug lord Carlos Ayala who is a big distributor for the Obregón brothers. His wife Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has her world turned upside down and she takes matters into her own hands as the cartel demands payment. Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid) is their business associate.Director Steven Soderbergh skillfully weaves together these great stories. The pitfall for these types of multiple-storyline movies is the uneven interest in the various stories. In this movie, every story is interesting headed by top rate actors. They compliment each other as the movie unfolds. Del Toro is terrific. The washed-out colors give this a documentary style and separate the different story threads. It is simply an all-around well-made movie.",Traffic
3,Hitchcoc,"Awfully Depressing, If True",9,8 January 2010,"I couldn't stop watching this, but, like ""The Godfather,"" I didn't want things like this to be so powerful. This is really masterfully edited piece of work, keeping about ten different balls in the air at one time. We have the bad guys, the drug lords, the hit men, the drug connection, the drug victim, the clueless politician, and so on. We are moved from one to the other, and, what at the beginning seems incomprehensible, begins to grow on us. I need to see this again to get a handle on who's who, but on first viewing, I was stunned. Del Torre (the Usual Suspects) is so striking on the screen. Facially, he may be the best actor working today. Michael trades in his usually violent, anything-goes character for one who slowly becomes aware of the beast he is trying to slay. I can't deal with all the characters, but the chief character is the the whole drug trafficking industry and what it does. There is a great scene where cares pass into Mexico, virtually unstopped. At the Mexico/U. S. border, the lines are endless. Still the stuff comes through at about a fifty percent rate. I recently heard someone talking about the use of the express ""War on Drugs."" He said it was laughable because we are really powerless to stop enough to make a difference. Look at any schoolyard or backstreet or bedroom in some MacMansion. This is certainly a powerful film, but its implications are devastating.",Traffic
4,classicsoncall,"""It's time to see the front lines.""",9,20 April 2018,"""Traffic"" is intricately plotted with three finely interwoven parallel stories that provide different views of the ongoing drug war in the United States and Mexico. As such, one's required to pay attention with the shifting focus on the principal players in each saga. Probably the most horrific aspect of the picture has to do with Caroline Wakefield (Erika Christensen), daughter of the President's newly appointed national drug czar (Michael Douglas), descending to the depths of her crack addiction that includes episodes of prostitution to get her fix. If it were possible, I would have reached into the screen and smacked her boyfriend Seth (Topher Grace) for his inconsequential reaction to Caroline's misery, he simply stood by and watched as she was abused by predatory drug dealers.Following the action of Mexican drug agents Javier Rodriguez (Benicio del Toro) and partner Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas), along with their American DEA counterparts Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman), is a little more challenging, as their connection to the Mexican drug cartels is apparent, though their paths never cross even though they target common adversaries. The frustration involved in pursuing, finding and bringing the major players in the drug wars to justice is perhaps the main point of the story, as the film's conclusion doesn't leave anyone feeling convinced it will ever be won. Anyone expecting closure on the part of the principals is bound to be left disappointed, as each of the characters is left to deal with their personal tragedies on their own. In fact, the ones who look like the winners here are Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer) and wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who successfully wend their way through criminal court proceedings and survive to become even more wealthy, hand in hand with the Obregon drug cartel.",Traffic
5,gavin6942,Great But Uneven,7,13 February 2015,"A conservative judge (Michael Douglas) is appointed by the President to spearhead America's escalating war against drugs, only to discover that his teenage daughter is an addict.That weird coloring and filming technique -- artistic or annoying? Soderbergh is a strange guy, with some big successes and some big misses. This one would seem to be a success (look at those Academy Awards), but I still have to question the colors... it seems to serve no purpose other than to make the film look bad.Well, what do I know? At least the story and characters are compelling, telling the story of the drug war from multiple sides. Is it fair and balanced? Maybe. Is it accurate? Possibly. If nothing else, it is engaging.",Traffic
6,lee_eisenberg,"preceding ""Syriana""",6,2 June 2006,"Recently, Stephen Gaghan directed and Steven Soderbergh produced ""Syriana"", about everything that has resulted from US involvement in the Middle East. We might say that they preceded that movie with ""Traffic"", about the futility of the drug wars and how the whole trade affects various people.The movie starts off by showing Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro, who won Best Supporting Actor); he and his partner travel around the northern part of the country looking for drug smugglers. Then, we get introduced to Judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), soon to get appointed drug czar of the United States, but unaware of something shocking. And then, San Diego feds Monty (Don Cheadle) and Ray (Luis Guzman) have to bust drug smuggler Carlos Ayala (Miguel Ferrer), leaving his pregnant wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) with no one.I will say that the movie isn't perfect. It misses the chance to focus on the CIA's involvement in drug trafficking over the years. Moreover, all the Mexico scenes are filmed in sepia; are we to infer that our southern neighbor is nothing but a drug-infested cesspool? But anyway, the movie does a very good job taking a grim look at everything associated with the drug wars. The aforementioned cast members do a very good job, as do Dennis Quaid, Amy Irving, Erika Christensen and Topher Grace (Sens. Don Nickles, Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Orrin Hatch and Charles Grassley also appear). I do recommend this movie, despite it's flaws.",Traffic
7,jboothmillard,Traffic,7,31 January 2011,"From Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated director Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape; Erin Brockovich, Ocean's Eleven), I had heard about this film mostly from the awards and its featuring in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I thought to take a look. Basically it is set in the modern day, focusing on the world of America's growing war on drugs, seeing the users and addicts, the narcotics trade, and of course those trying to fight against it, using multi-strand storytelling and three main plots connected in subtle ways. Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a Supreme Court judge from Ohio, has appointed a new drug tsar for his nation, but his position is made daunting when he discovers his teenage own daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is addicted to cocaine (and maybe some other drugs). Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzmán) are DEA agents pursuing Helena Ayala (Golden Globe nominated Catherine Zeta-Jones), the wife of kingpin husband Carlos (Steven Bauer) who is in jail, as she takes over his business, including of course the involvement of drugs. Javier Rodriguez (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Benicio Del Toro) is a corrupt but dedicated police constable in Mexico who struggles to make the right decisions when he finds out his boss may not be against the drugs market. Also starring Dennis Quaid as Arnie Metzger, Clifton Collins Jr. as Francisco Flores, Miguel Ferrer as Eduardo Ruiz, Topher Grace as Seth Abrahms, Amy Irving as Barbara Wakefield, D.W. Moffett as Jeff Sheridan, Albert Finney as Chief of Staff, James Brolin as General Ralph Landry, The Mask's Peter Riegert as Attorney Michael Adler and Salma Hayek as Rosario. Douglas is good as the father struggling to control her daughter's crack habit, his wife Zeta-Jones is really good as the unknowing and concerned pregnant wife of a gangster, and of course Del Toro gave a calmer and sensitive performance rather than gritty villain like usual. Every once in a while one of the stories blends in to one of the others, only very slightly, it was a little hard to understand each story individually, but I understood some of what was going on, so from what I gathered, it is quite a worthwhile crime drama. It won the Oscars for Best Editing for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and it was nominated for Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!",Traffic
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Not A Fun Ride To Take In This Traffic, But A Fascinating Trip",6,1 September 2006,"This is an ugly story but still fascinating to watch, at least once. I'm not sure about more than twice, at least from my experience. It's too much of a downer to enjoy regularly but I do recommend a minimum of one viewing for the unique way it's presented, especially for those who like a different visual/audio approach.Like him or not, Michael Douglas usually plays interesting roles and this is no exception. Benicio Del Toro got an Oscar for his role but I don't know why. He wasn't anything that special. Personally, I liked Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman in here better with the latter adding some much-needed humor to the film. Miguel Ferrer was also intense as the bad guy, ""Eduardo Ruiz."" The two kids who played Douglas's daughter and her boyfriend (Erika Christensen and Topher Grace, respectively), received no billing on the back on the DVD but they had major roles. They must have done a good job because they really irritated me. Man, I wanted to slap those annoying punks! The girl's descent into drug hell was not pleasant to view. This is not an easy story to watch, or comprehend everything that's going on. It also is not one with a happy message.On the plus side, the visuals were great with many all-sepia toned scenes, or all blue. Scenes changed every two minutes to a different ongoing. You had to really pay attention but I never found myself drifting away from the story. It isn't just the unique visuals; it's an interesting and disturbing story.",Traffic
9,rmax304823,Can't Win For Losing.,8,21 November 2005,"This is a superior anti-drug flick all the way around. It doesn't provide any easy answers. In fact, it provides no answers whatever except to keep on trying to stop something that appears impossible to stop.Well, after all, we're talking global village here. The people that farm and refine hard drugs like heroin and cocaine are genuinely puzzled by our insistence that they stop. An awful lot of Colombians and Afghanis depend on their crops for a living, however modest, and the folks that bring it to us make very big bucks indeed. And who are they selling it to? All of those among us who are willing to pay for it. In economics this is known as a ""market demand."" If we didn't use it, the market would dry up.The movie is splendidly done, a movie for adults. The losses are big ones and the triumphs are small and ironic. A lawman sees a friend blown to bits and in return he manages to successfully plant a transmitter under a drug lord's table. (Some trade.) The direction is kind of effectively loose limbed. A lot of the conversation sounds unscripted, naturalistic, as does much of ""All The President's Men,"" for instance. The script is nicely written too, without a great deal of hype, and even with a few gags thrown in. One DEA officer tells another, ""This is the beach where I first got laid."" The other replies, ""Was he good to you?"" And they turn and stare at each other with raised eyebrows but no smiles. Perfectly done -- and useful too, because we need to know these two guys have that kind of friendship.The performances are quite good too, with many familiar faces in small roles. Without in any way demeaning the others, Don Cheadle's DEA officer is magnetic.The photography, direction, and editing are all above par. There are one or two shots that leave the viewer a bit jangled (a helicopter landing shot upside down, for instance) but they add to the sense of disorientation that the story generates, and they aren't frequent enough to be distracting.The use of tinted film has not only a dramatic impact but is practical in helping us separate the three story lines woven into the film. A melancholy blue follows Michael Douglas around in Cincinatti and Washington. The La Jolla story is sun drenched. The Mexican subplot is a dry thoroughly baked ochre. Characters from the separate plots pass one another on the sidewalks and streets without knowing it.No point in dwelling further on this. It's a fine movie, well worth seeing.",Traffic
10,Quinoa1984,The Best Picture of the Year; surprised the hell outta me,10,6 January 2001,"At fist I thought that was it.  That the top 10 list I made up from this year was complete.  That was until I saw Steven Soderbergh's best film to date called Traffic, which not only broke through my top 10 list, it went straight to one.  Because this is quite the impressive thriller/drama combo.The film has a story with 3 different stories all connecting (not all to each other, but in one way or another) about drugs.  The drug selling, the people in the government trying to fight drugs, the problems in Mexico with drug cartels and people who don't even know that the money they get is from drug sales.  It is a vicious cycle that is well brought together by fine acting including Benicio Del-Torro as a hard working mexican cop brought in to fight the cartels, and Michael Douglas as a Judge who becomes the new drug czar while his daughter is slipping down the spiral of drugdome (ie Coke, Crack and Smack).  All of the performances are top notch and with that plus expert cinematography (I love the idea of having a different look for Mexico and a look for US) and finite direction, this is one of the best films I have ever seen on drugs in general.

A less holistic (or, more liner tracing of the drug trafficking) might have been more appealing, The film's editing doesn't take advantage of its emotional peaks, which should have built to a climatic crescendo. And, the camera, in an effort to enhance the strung-out storyline, shakes too much. On the plus side, the production and players are very good. Mr. Soderbergh comes close to capturing a 1980s (Cocaine Decade) feel; and, while unrelated to that mood, his cinematography is beautiful. Happily, the film realizes you don't declare ""WAR!"" on things like poverty, drugs, and terrorism.

12,michaelRokeefe,Nothing less than terrific. Drugs are the enemy in this war.,8,12 August 2001,"Kudos to director Steven Soderbergh for this look at the war against drugs. Cinematography, sometimes choppy editing and the great hand held camera work gives a feel of watching a news special instead of a movie. The subtitles almost get to be a pain in the butt. Very diverse cast and the myriad of stories that sometimes interchange make this one of the better movies to come along in a good while.Michael Douglas is a judge appointed by the President to be America's drug czar. He is very ambitious with this temporary assignment until he discovers that his daughter Erika Christensen is more than casually partaking of heavy drugs. Benicio Del Toro is a corrupt Mexican police officer that flirts danger by playing both sides against the middle. The ever so beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones is the wife of a cocaine distributor. Don Cheadle is an eager DEA agent. Dennis Quaid is a two-faced attorney. Miguel Ferrer is a captured import/export trafficer that is to be a star witness in federal court. Most of these characters lives intersect the others directly or indirectly. Users, dealers, investigators, politicians...each element is sampled in this glimpse into the drug driven counter culture.Supporting actors of note are: Luis Guzman, Clifton Collins Jr, and small roles for Benjamin Bratt, James Brolin and Albert Finney.

13,sunwarrior13,A Masterpiece Multi-Character Film,10,29 September 2012,"Traffic is a crime drama film that explores the illegal drug trade from a number of perspectives: a user, an enforcer, a politician and a trafficker. Their stories are edited together throughout the film, although some of the characters do not meet each other. The cast includes Michael Douglas,Don Cheadle,Benicio del Toro,Dennis Quaid and Catherine Zeta-Jones.The screenplay was written by Stephen Gaghan,which was based upon a miniseries originally aired in Britain; and it directed by Steven Soderbergh.The movie divides its time among three main story lines and almost a dozen locales. The first and primary plot thread, set in Ohio and Washington, D.C., concerns freshly-appointed drug czar Robert Wakefield, whose enthusiasm for his new prestige position is quickly offset when he realizes his 16- year-old daughter Caroline is graduating from recreational drug use to habitual abuse which happens to be a secret that his wife, Barbara has kept from him. South of the border, Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez attempts to wage his own war on drugs, heading off a cocaine shipment in the middle of the desert with his partner Manolo Sanchez. Surrounded by corruption, Javier approaches the drug war with an attitude of patience and compromise, which opens him up to investigation from General Arturo Salazar, the country's dubious drug-enforcement liaison to the U.S. Meanwhile, San Diego drug kingpin Carlos Alaya is caught in a sting operation spearheaded by DEA agents Montel Gordon and Ray Castro, leaving behind his very pregnant and very oblivious wife, Helena. At the behest of Carlos' lawyer and shady confidante, Arnie Metzger,Helena decides to carry on the family business that causes tragic consequences.Traffic is such a complex film yet artfully done in such a way that you cannot help but sit back and admire it.In terms of modern films, it kicked off a whole list of issue-related multi-character dramas like Syriana, Crash, and Babel.Apparently,it holds a candle to the films mentioned previously or it may be the best of all of them, even if some of its stories are stronger than others.Aside from that,the issues of ethics are gray rather than being presented as black-and-white especially with with no clear-cut good and bad characters in the film.Finally,great performances abound in this film from the cast involved.Also,don't forget the great direction and screenplay that it is easy to say that this film work at all levels.",Traffic
14,Theo Robertson,Somewhat Mixed,7,15 December 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Soderbergh`s interpretation of the British mini series just about works , but why shoot yourself in the foot by making it arthouse ? Like THE LIMEY Soderbergh doesn`t seem to believe an audience will watch a film where characters walk about without any visual gimmicks . Why does the director have to shoot in sepia in order to show us where the story is located ? I`d have absolutely no complaints if the camera work was done in a fly on the wall style but that wouldn`t be enough for this director.The other problem I had was the screenplay adaption .  ( !!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER TO ORIGINAL MINI SERIES !!!! ) In the original Channel 4 show the story starts with a British politician meeting a Pakistani politician and a German businessman . As the story develops it turns out the Pakistani politician is growing opium , turning it into heroin , selling it to the German businessman who distrubutes it all over Europe and indirectly sells it to the British politician`s daughter who is a smack addict ( END SPOILER ) In this film there`s little connection between the stories , I think the closest we get is when Zeta Jones character walks past Javier . Another minus is the fact that if you`ve seen the original you`ll know what happens next plot wise because - despite the switching to an American location - much of what happens is identical to the mini series .
Maybe that`s why I enjoyed the Mexican sequences so much which is total invention on the part of the screenwriter and has no equivilent in the British original . Javier is an incorruptable Mexican cop superbly played by Benecio Del Toro and very understated . Is he gay ? He lives on his own but look at the way he picks up the suspect at the bar . Always good to see an Oscar for acting going to a non English speaking partAll in all a fairly good film that`s worth watching once .

15,jotix100,Drug culture,10,7 September 2005,"We were great admirers of the mini series in which this film is based. Written with great attention to detail by Simon Moore, it was shown on Public television. We gather it might have made an impact on director Steven Soderbergh because he directed the film version. The screen play is by Stephen Gaghan, who transfers the action from Europe to America and makes it compelling as it involves us because both the director and the writer are speaking about things we all seem to be familiar with.The drug traffic in the film is basically from Mexico into the United States. We are given a prominent family at the center of the story, the Wakefields. We also see the Ayalas, who are the kingpins of the drug operation, and then, the soldiers who are in charge of distribution to all kinds of people in all ways of life. Robert Wakefield awakens to find out his own daughter victim of an addiction, he was not aware of.Mr. Soderbergh moves his large cast well. Some of the performances are brilliant. Benicio Del Toro makes quite an impression as the corrupt Javier Rodriguez. This was a role for him to play, as we can't imagine any other young actor who could have given the part the intensity and the dimension given by Mr. Del Toro.The other surprise is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who usually doesn't play this kinds of roles. She plays the wife of the obnoxious Ayala, and she shows at the end of the film she is really in charge of the action and she is not ready to let anyone interfere with the style of life that the illegal drugs have provided her with.The rest of the cast is excellent. Michael Douglas shows rage as he discovers to what extent he and his family have been exposed because he never suspected his own daughter. Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle make some interesting contribution to the film.

""Traffic"" is told almost documentary like and the most excellent cinematography, acting and dialog all contribute to the movie its raw documentary like feeling.The movie features several different plot lines with different characters but all stories are connected by one thing; drugs. The movie doesn't try to make things look better than they are, or give a hopeful message, it just shows how it is. The movie is very direct, straight to the point and confronting. The story and the situations all feel very realistic and that's also one of the reasons why this movie looks more like a documentary than a movie.Each storyline literally has its own color which works perfect and truly also adds to the atmosphere. Each storyline line is told like a movie on its own, with equally as much running time.The actors is also a reason why this movies works so well and is so extremely powerful. All of the actors give a very natural performance. Not only the main actors (Again director Soderbergh attracted an impressive cast with lots of big well known names.) but also the supporting actors. Apparently the movie has 135 speaking parts and I haven't seen one case of bad acting. But truly the one actor that really stands out is Benicio Del Toro. What an extremely good performance! Truly Oscar worthy. Also worth mentioning is Tomas Milian as the Mexican general Salazar.Seriously I can understand why a person will find this movie to be boring, I guess you just have to a bit of a movie-buff to fully appreciate and see the 'beauty' and the profession this movie is made with.

18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Smart and devoid of bias, and not only ""for a Hollywood movie""",8,4 October 2009,"This is something as utterly unusual as a film that actually presents a complex subject as, well, just that. There are no easy answers to the problem of drugs, and this acknowledges that fact. The opening scene begins a trend within this picture that goes on until the end credits start rolling; that of credibly conveying powerful points that cannot be ignored on the issue, as well as covering so many areas of it. This holds next to no manipulation. The plot is interesting, engaging and well-told. Each of story-line is treated with a tint appropriate to its tone. This works impeccably well. All acting performance are spot-on and flawless. The dialog is excellent and marvelously delivered. Everyone is perfectly cast. I don't know a lot about Christensen, but she is beyond reproach here, and I intend to keep an eye out for her in the future. This is the most compelling I've seen Topher Grace be. The pacing is swift without being overwhelming, so the running time passes by fast, without ever losing the audience. As a thriller, this is exciting and intelligent. Editing is razor-sharp, and the cinematography is magnificent, the hand-held camera is used to great effect, and not excessively. Apart from obviously featuring and dealing with narcotics, this contains plentiful strong language, moderate sexuality and disturbing content. The DVD holds four trailers(for this, The Gift, The Watcher and Rat Race), production notes, a photo gallery and B-Roll footage. This deserves all four Oscars that were awarded. I recommend this to anyone mature enough. 8/10",Traffic

It's not purely from the glamourous angle of being a drug kingpin, nor purely from the depressing angle of being a drug user; it explores all of that. There are the Mexican cartels and the different players south of the border, and up in America there is the smuggler, the smuggler's wife, the smuggler's lawyer, the U.S. drug tsar, the drug tsar's junkie daughter, various politicians, the DEA, the mid-level drug seller turned snitch, and various other bit players. It is a near complete package that paints a dismal picture.The performances were splendid all around. I'd hand out trophies to everyone in this movie. ""Traffic"" was about fighting a war on drugs and fighting a war for drugs, and it was also about winners and losers in the whole affair. The winners, regardless of what side of the fight, never totally win, while the losers can certainly totally lose. ""Traffic"" is unapologetically raw and glamorizes no one.

Another strong storyline involves a mother who turns to drug trafficking as the only way to keep her little boy safe. This was the first film to suggest that Catherine Zeta-Jones (who plays the mother) could actually act.Soderbergh, who himself served as the film's cinematographer, chooses to film each of the three story lines in starkly different lighting schemes, a gimmick intended no doubt to help audiences keep track of the complicated narrative and which should be annoying, but which instead lends the film a unique style.Grade: A",Traffic
21,ferguson-6,Face Time with Significant Others,8,12 January 2001,"Greetings again from the darkness.  And this time I do mean darkness.  The overrated Steven Soderbergh takes us into the belly of drug dealers and trafficers.  Sorry, it is a somewhat fascinating topic, but sure seems difficult to relate to.  The scenes in the Mexico desert seem cleaner than they should.  I enjoy overlapping story lines, and Soderbergh's use of grain/filters/lighting/color to dramatize the different worlds is a nice touch.  However, there are 15-20 minutes of the movie that could be lost and the pace would improve drastically.  Michael Douglas, with his strange amber dye-job, sleep walks through his role.  Face it, he is not the strong, silent type.  He is much more effective when he wears his emotions on his sleeve.  Two actors steal the movie: Benecio Del Toro and Don Cheadle.  Del Toro is marvelous!  Talk about quiet explosiveness - this guy has IT. Cheadle continues his string of strong support roles, both serious and funny.  The craziest thing about this picture is noticing how many of the actors are affiliated with real-life significant others or family members. Of course, there are newlyweds Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones; Benjamin Bratt (Julia Roberts); James Brolin (Barbra Streisand); Miguel Ferrer (son of Jose Ferrer and Rosemary Clooney); Dennis Quaid (ex of Meg Ryan); Amy Irving (ex of Steven Speilberg), and Selma Hayek (OK, no famous relatives, but she is gorgeous!).

22,anaconda-40658,Heavy Traffic.,10,21 April 2016,"Traffic (2000): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Toro, Amy Irving: Provocative masterpiece about the impact of drugs in our society. Michael Douglas plays a district attorney leading the war against drugs yet is unaware of his daughter's drug addiction until she is taken into police custody. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a wife whose husband is arrested for drug possession. When she cannot bail him out, she plots to have the squealer murdered. Benicio Del Toro plays a Mexican cop assigned to bring down a drug lord. He suspects foul play on behalf of his partner and is left with a decision that marks him with regret. Steven Soderbergh's best film to date, and certainly better than that overrated wretch he directed the same year called Erin Brockovich. Superb performance by Douglas whose ethics are crossed when family is involved. Zeta-Jones is excellent as a woman of vicious means. Del Toro is flawless as a cop who sees the dread of the system. Don Cheadle plays a cop out to avenge his partner's death and uses clever means in order to plant a device. Amy Irving is featured as the the wife of Douglas and whose daughter is involved in these crimes. Well crafted film that addresses its theme in a non traditional manner, which is needed. It is not so much about the drug war but about reclaiming those from its clutches. Score: 10 / 10",Traffic
23,HotToastyRag,I wish I'd never seen it,1,20 December 2017,"Even though Traffic has an all-star cast, the famously raw direction of Steven Soderbergh, and won four Academy Awards, I can't in good conscience recommend that you watch this movie. It's incredibly disturbing, and the main message of the film can be understood without having to sit through two and half hours of upsetting material: Drugs are bad, damaging, and prevalent. There you have it! Save yourself, memorize that message, and just pretend you've seen Traffic when anyone asks you.Traffic is about drug trafficking, and it shows the journey of drugs coming up across the border from Mexico, how they're transferred from drug dealers to drug users, and eventually how they end up in the hands of our most vulnerable: children. In the Mexican scenes, Benicio Del Toro-who won Best Supporting Actor-Jacob Vargas, and Tomas Milian star. When the DEA agents are trying to arrest American drug lords, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Miguel Ferrer, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Dennis Quaid, Steven Bauer, and Benjamin Bratt star. And in the scenes that tragically show bored teenagers developing drug addictions, Michael Douglas, James Brolin, Albert Finney, Amy Irving, Erika Christensen, and Topher Grace star.You can see why it's tempting to watch this film, since so many actors and actresses were recruited to take part, but unless you really enjoy watching gritty, upsetting movies that show the filthy underbelly of the country, you will be seriously scarred by watching it. If you are a parent, whether or not your child has developed a substance abuse problem or is as innocent as an angel, you will find this film extremely difficult to watch. Michael Douglas gives a wonderful performance, one that every parent and husband in the audience will identify with. Ironically, while there was quite a bit of hype of the real-life husband and wife pair starring in the same film, Michael and Catherine aren't in any scenes together, since they're separated by different storylines.I can't stop you from watching Traffic, but I can caution you as much as I can. The only reason I watched it was because I'd been cast as the lead role in the play Addict, whose title is probably self-explanatory. At the time, I had so little knowledge of drugs, I didn't even understand the lines my character was scripted to deliver. My brother insisted I watch Traffic with him as homework for the play. Given my druthers, I never would have watched it, and I sincerely wish I'd never been forced to sit through it in the first place.",Traffic
24,The_Void,"Dull, Boring and Excellent",1,4 December 2003,"This movie was really good, easily one of the best movies from the 2000's. A lot of people don't like it because it was extremely boring, but they're wrong.Yes, okay, it was extremely low in the entertainment department, but the storyline was fantastically dull and that's what makes it good! Why can't these people see that? The movie's lacklustre plot tackles America's increasingly mind-numbing war on the sale of illegal drugs. The film features a number of minimal, snail placed plots that reflect on this lacklustre 'war', featuring such uninteresting characters as a drug dealer's wife and some boring Mexican guy.The film is brought to life by Michael Douglas, who puts in the most boring performance of his career, Catherine Zeta-Jones was equally, if not more boring and Benico Del Toro's performance bored me away.
This movie features two hours of increasingly tedious plots and characters and if you can stay awake throughout the whole movie, you deserve my respect, not everyone can act like they're enjoying something that's as tiresome as anything you've ever seen.However, despite the fact that it's unceremoniously boring, this movie isn't quite perfect. One thing that it was obviously lacking was an 'Arnie' type character. he could have been employed by the US government to burst into the drug dealer's apartments and steal all their drugs. Then it could turn out that the government were stealing the drugs so they could sell them and build an army of super human cyborgs and take over the world. Actually, I suppose that might be entertaining, nevermind.So, in conclusion: this movie is extremely boring, and therefore award winning and therefore good. Watch it if you're in need of a nap.",Traffic
25,zetes,Has a few problems,8,6 January 2001,"Don't get me wrong, I do like this film, and I do feel that it might be the most important movie about the drug problem in the United States ever made (I don't know how many films could even compete with Traffic in that respect; how many films actually deal with this problem?). However, most of the characters in the film are two-dimensional, and the situations they experience are somewhat cliche. There are three main plot lines: 1) In Mexico, a police officer struggles with his own morality as he realizes that he is doing nothing but helping drug lords. 2) A pregnant woman's husband is arrested for being an alleged drug lord in California. She did not know what his business was before, but she is forced to deal with her husband's problems in a hurry as her life and the life of her son are threatened. And 3) A politician assigned to be the nations drug czar, the position which is basically the general of the ""war against drugs,"" finds out that his daughter is addicted to very serious drugs (freebase).Plotline 1 is interesting and exciting, but it is rife with cliches. Benicio del Torro is very good as the main character of this line. He is the cop who is involved in a corrupt system and who is getting sick of it. del Torro is good at showing his inner struggle, but the whole inner struggle thing is a cliche in itself. 2 could have been an episode of Hawaii Five-0 (not an insult, I love that show!). Catherine Zeta-Jones is excellent here, and she could be worthy of an Oscar nomination. Her situation is similar to the problem of Micheal Corleone in The Godfather (the first one), where he was the only law-abiding member of his family, but is forced to become a criminal. We watch Zeta-Jones go from offering lemonade to two police officers who are tailing her to trying to murder those same two officers. These two officers were my favorite characters throughout the film, mostly because of the actors who played them, two of the best character actors we have today, Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman. They are pretty cliche, too, but I guess any police officer in this situation would be. They wise crack as they sit in a van listening to bugged conversations, and when protecting a witness. The whole witness-protecting part is a little silly, though. They actually have hotel staff deliver food instead of police officers, which I'm sure is NEVER done. Maybe if the characters in this film were familiar with Hawaii Five-0, they wouldn't have made such a ridiculous mistake.3 perhaps works the best out of all the plotlines, and would work the best as a film of its own (the other two sections, I believe, would have failed on their own due to the cliches). The cliche here is that a busy man has too little time to deal with his daughter, so, isolated, she experiments with drugs. Micheal Douglas is excellent here. His final speech is very powerful in its simplicity. They could have written for this character a very long speech with heavy music playing behind it, but instead he has two lines that hit like a sledgehammer. The daughter is also excellent as the addict. My complements also to Topher Grace, Eric Foreman from Fox's That 70s Show, as the rich kid who gets everyone addicted to drugs. Liking him so much in That 70s Show, it is actually kind of hilarious to watch him here, especially with some of the very difficult lines he has to speak. The entire situation is, alas, all a cliche, though. I think it is Micheal Douglas' acting ability and his final speech, and even this section's conclusion, that make this the best part of the film.I actually like Soderbergh's other two crime dramas a lot better, The Limey, which was a very good movie despite the distracting editing (I reviewed it, if you want to link off of my name), and Out of Sight, which was one of the best crime dramas of the 90s, even competing with Pulp Fiction. Those two films were extraordinarily original works, while Traffic is more or less a collection of cliches. Luckily, the cliches are held together by both acting and direction (and cinematography, also, which was actually done by Soderbergh). It does turn out to be better than the sum of its parts. Its message is gotten through quite well, even if it is a message of hopelessness (although segment 3 ends positively; I'm not sure why we end with segment 3, del Torro watching a baseball game; perhaps I missed something). I give it an 8/10.",Traffic

You will still get the losers that want to get high but at least they won't commit any crime to get their next fix. But it's all utopia because even the governments are so corrupt by all the money that there is to be made that they don't want to win this war. The cast was really good for this movie.

Anyone who anguishes over a child or other loved one addicted to drugs may find it hard to watch. Even those whose lives haven't been touched adversely by drugs may find it disturbing to their peace of mind. ""Has our country  our culture, really come to this?"" some will ask. But, this is a movie that needed to be made. More like it are needed, including films that don't focus on the downfall, the fallen and the seedy ""business"" of the drug trade. We need a film that looks at the high society side of drug use. Hollywood, Broadway and other places where the celebrity and wealthy users keep the drug trade viable and lucrative in the U.S. Perhaps so many are part of the scene now that such a film isn't possible. This film is an independent venture – not even made in Hollywood. It was filmed in more than two dozen locations around the U.S. and in Mexico. The reasons for this film's ""R"" rating are obvious. But, as hard as it is, ""Traffic"" should be seen by every person from the early teens up.

29,namashi_1,A Treat!,10,20 October 2010,"Steven Soderbergh's Academy-Award-Winning Film 'Traffic' is indeed a treat of a film. First of all, by saying Treat, I mean, for those who love dark/intelligent cinema. This 2000 classic doesn't belong to mad-cap movie-fans.'Traffic' explores the intricacies of the illegal drug trade from a number of perspectives: a user, an enforcer, a politician and a trafficker. Their point of views and expressions are wonderfully explored on in those odd 145-minutes. The characters are so twisted and interesting, that just don't lose yourself in your seat. It has also has a terrific culmination working all the way to the advantage.Steven Soderbergh's direction is a pure genius. He handles a tough subject with multi-color and as mentioned, twisted characters. And, his Oscar-Win is his greatest compliment. Peter Andrews's Cinematography is top-notch. Screenplay by Stephen Gaghan is tough enough. Stephen Mirrione's editing leaves no stone unturned to become legendary.In the acting department, Benicio del Toro is absolutely amazing in a multiple-award-winning role. Michael Douglas is first-rate, as always. Erika Christensen is excellent. Catherine Zeta-Jones does well. Don Cheadle is hugely effective. Dennis Quaid is superb in a role that offers him shades.On the whole, an experience you have to catch if haven't. Two Thumbs Up!",Traffic
30,JamesHitchcock,"No, that's not ""Traffic"" as in ""cars on the road""",6,13 July 2013,"No, that's not ""Traffic"" as in ""cars on the road"", and it's not a remake of Jacques Tati's classic comedy. That's ""Traffic"" as in ""the illegal drug trade"". The film is an example of what has become known as ""hyperlink cinema"", the style of film-making which uses several different story lines intercut with one another rather than following one another sequentially (as in the ""portmanteau film""). Generally, these various story lines have a single unifying theme, here that of drug trafficking. The style is said to have been pioneered by the late Robert Altman in films like ""Short Cuts"" and became popular in the 2000s; ""Crash"", ""Syriana"", ""The Hours"" and ""Babel"" are other well-known examples from that decade. Here there are three separate story lines. In one a Mexican general launches a crack-down on the operations of a drug-smuggling gang, but only because he is in the pay of another cartel who want their rivals put out of business. In another a San Diego businessman named Carlos Ayala is arrested by America's Drug Enforcement Administration who believe him, with good reason, to be a major drug dealer, much to the shock of his pregnant young wife Helena who always believed her husband's business to be legitimate. The third story concerns Robert Wakefield, a judge who is appointed as the President's drug Czar but who discovers that his own teenage daughter, Caroline, has a serious drug problem. There is a certain amount of interlinking between the stories; one character from the Mexican story, for example, is hired as an assassin to try and kill the main witness against Ayala. Director Steven Soderbergh uses the device (also used by Stephen Daldry in ""The Hours"") of adopting a distinctive cinematographic tint for each story; this is particularly noticeable in the Mexican scenes, which have very muted colours. From my perspective, the best of the three story lines was that involving Judge Wakefield, a sombre but moving tale involving characters with whom the viewer could identify. There is a particularly distinguished contribution from Michael Douglas as the judge, a hardliner who finds his hard line beginning to soften when he realises that the drug issue, previously something of which he had only had academic knowledge, is something which affects his family personally. (The role was apparently first offered to Harrison Ford, who turned it down partly because he was not offered enough money and partly because he wanted to ""reconnect with his action fans."") Erika Christensen, only eighteen at the time, is also very good as the tormented Caroline, which makes me wonder why she was so bad in the only other film in which I have seen her, ""Swimfan"". The other two stories have a certain amount of dramatic power, particularly the one involving Ayala, but neither have what one might call a character with whom the viewer can identify. Catherine Zeta- Jones's Helena might initially seem a sympathetic character, a victim of her husband's cruel deception, but after his arrest she quickly reveals herself to be just as ruthless as he is, which must call into question her protestations that she was unaware of the true nature of his enterprise. Benicio del Toro's Mexican police officer is a man of integrity, but does not really emerge as the hero of the film. Like ""Syriana"" from five years later, ""Traffic"" is a film with a message, the message in this case being that the so-called ""War on Drugs"" is unwinnable and that a more liberal approach to the issue is needed; this message is driven home particularly strongly in the Wakefield story. (Both films were written by Stephen Gaghan, who in the case of ""Syriana"" also acted as director). ""Traffic"" is certainly the better of the two films; ""Syriana"" is over-complex, overlong and overly didactic. At least in ""Traffic"" Gaghan does not allow his political message to get in the way of the story, as he was to do in the later film. I would also rate ""Traffic"" as being more original than many of Soderbergh's more recent efforts, such as the formulaic ""Ocean's"" crime capers and last year's dreadful ""Haywire"". The main problem with the film, however, is that it is only fitfully (mostly in the Wakefield scenes) able to capture the sense of emotional power which marks hyperlink cinema at its best, as in ""Crash"", ""The Hours"" and especially ""Babel"". 6/10",Traffic
31,StevePulaski,This is a director with something to say,9,9 March 2013,"Director Steven Soderbergh, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite contemporary talents, has made over thirty films, some generating modest reception and others reaching high levels of praise. Traffic, by textbook definition, is probably his objective ""best,"" generating awards, controversy, discussion, shedding light on an issue, and most importantly, profit. All of its additional successes and trivia-points are well-deserved, as this is a truly compelling picture, unfairly shortchanged, presently, in the public eye. In a world where ""the war on drugs"" has escalated to unprecedented heights and profits are raging uncontrollably, this is a film that doesn't age with time and shows more than what should've been allowed.To put it simply and bluntly, Traffic is a work of an anti-anthology, where we are introduced to a number of characters in similar situations, yet none of them ever come full-circle in a wraparound story. I will make an effort sum up the characters and their stories as quickly as possible, so as to leave much to be desired to you. For starters, Benicio Del Toro plays Javier Rodriguez, a Mexican police officer torn between which of the two Mexican drug cartels he runs to continue supporting. Should he fend for one and forget the other, or turn in his information to higher authorities and completely compromise the profits he gets to survive? Michael Douglas plays Robert Wakefield, a conservative politician attempting to combat ""the war on drugs"" as quickly as possible, at the same time he finds out his own daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen), is a cocaine addict. Ranking in the top three in her Junior class at an exclusive private high school, Caroline resorts from hitting the books to feeding the habit, resorting to prostitution to support this lethal addiction. The final ""main"" story centers around Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an upper-middle-class woman whose life is shell-shocked when her husband is arrested for drug dealing, she realizes, and must take up a life of being a drug mule to possibly save his well-being in prison.Another story that keeps popping up every now and then involves Ray and Montel (Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle), two undercover detectives usually working inside their van and staging drug-busts on suspects. Their work is dangerous, demanding, and often, meticulously staged and they wouldn't have it any other way.Right off the bat, it's hard not to recognize the amazing cast of champions Traffic serenely, but effectively boasts. If there's a word for their performances all together, it's nuanced, as they are not showy and none of them appear to be designed with awards in mind. Everyone here, most notably Douglas and Del Toro, although there's not an average one in the bunch, are low-key and compelling, mainly due to their sympathetic nature. Even the most despicable acts done by characters, we at least have the ability to see where the characters are coming from.There are, undoubtedly, dozens of truths one can extract from Traffic in an effort to completely prove ""the war on drugs"" to be nonsense and almost wholly ineffective. The one truth I, myself, can extract with full confidence is a point brought up by Caroline, which is ""it's easier for me and my friends to get drugs than alcohol."" Because alcohol is legal, it's regulated heavily, with a certain age to be able to consume it. When it comes to drugs, especially with many of the hardcore ones banned in America, they are sold illegally by men and women who do not care what age the person is or what their reason is for acquiring such drugs. So long as they get money and lose some supplies, they couldn't care less what happens to them or what becomes of their habits.As of right now, this is Soderbergh's most daring exercise. He boldly stands up to the narcotics controversy that has plagued American for an untold number of years, showing the effects of prohibition and how numerous lives have intentionally and unintentionally been effected by drugs. This is not a work of exploitation or shock, but of blunt honesty, showing how numerous different people are effected and thrown into turmoil by a huge problem that is almost too large to contain. In many ways, I believe the issue of drugs isn't too far germane to the gun control issue. It seems people are bringing up flawed solutions to closet their views on the underlying, truly unavoidable result; the problem will likely never go away.On a final note, pay attention to the cinematography during the course of this film. The scenes in Mexico are heavily saturated, making the film have a yellowish glow to it, due to the sunshine and the gold sand. Often we can be blinded by the oppressive sunlight almost penetrating the camera lens through every shot, growing more and more fierce with every sequence. As a stylistic attribute, it's a rather noteworthy one, and may have subtle ambiguous serendipity to the story. Could it be that the climate as an effect on their behavior? Or that the sun itself represents something larger, like a watching eye? Or maybe does it reflect the constantly glaring, incorruptible pressure of their job by showing the oppressive relentless of something. Like many instances in Traffic, Soderbergh leaves you to be the judge.Starring: Michael Douglas, Erika Christensen, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Dennis Quaid, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Steven Bauer, and James Brolin, and Topher Grace.

32,=G=,Probably the best overview of the Mex/Am drug problem yet,7,29 May 2001,"""Traffic"" is a lean and sinewy flick which walks astride the US/Mexican border (mainly Tijuana, Baja CA) as it takes the audience into the ""war on drugs"" at many levels. The film interleaves several stories in a Magnolia-esque fashion so as to tell its tale from top (US Drug Czar) to bottom (street pusher). Sonderbergh uses a variety of techniques including jiggly shoulder cams, color filtration, grain/contrast, background music & sound, etc. effectively to help create coherence from the chaos which is the drug war as well as for artistic effect. The result is an excellent fast moving overview of the paradoxical Mexican/American drug problem in a 2.5 hour watch with drama, action, and even some moments of humor delivered by a stellar cast. A good adult drama which may be a tad over-touted and is more interesting than compelling and more compelling than evocative.",Traffic

I've never been very impressed by Steven Soderbergh and this film continues my disappointment. It starts off brilliant - a rough, gritty, European-like art-house epic with filtered colors and beautiful cinematography...but soon it goes downhill. It runs out of steam - fast. The characters and all their many stories start to become dull and plodding; I didn't really find myself caring one way or another about Michael Douglas and his daughter, played by Erika Christensen (who had the honor of acting in the film ""Swimf@n"" with resident IMDb spammer and self-promoter Monroe Mann, who claims to be ""Oscar bound"").Catherine Zeta-Jones is simply unimpressive (as always) and I was only really interested in Don Cheadle and Benicio del Toro's characters; they were not only the deepest but also most intriguing and well-acted.The plot - or whatever there is of it (it just seems to be a few stories connected by the central theme of illegal drug trafficking) is based on a European mini-series called ""Traffik."" The miniseries is better.I didn't hate this, but I was disappointed and soon found it testing my patience.

Secondly, the film was made the same year than another anti-drug movie: ""Requiem For a Dream"", the two movies complete each other very well, and would have made a better pair of co-nominees; parenthesis closed.""Traffic"" uses a narrative structure popularized by Robert Altman with ""Nashville"" (and later ""Short Cuts"") and Fellini with his ""Amarcord"", the term was coined as ""'Hyperlink Cinema"" and it defined movies made of different interlocking stories, with no apparent connection, until they all finally converge toward a final realization of informational or existential value. This storytelling method has been popularized by Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson but ""Traffic"" is less a ""Magnolia"" meets ""Requiem for a Dream"" than the true consecration of a form of storytelling, paving the way to many socially-loaded documentary-like dramas like ""City of God"", ""Syriana"", ""Crash"" and ""Babel"".""Traffic"" is a product of a new time where Internet had emphasized our capacity to process brief, impacting and flashy information at the same time, sometimes at the expense of understanding but most commonly, for the sake of objectivity as today's audiences are less inclined to believe anything shown from one perspective and even in the case of drugs, we need the big picture. And what ""Traffic"" does is reconciling a new positive mindset with big-scope storytelling, showing how the titular word is handled by Mexican law enforcers, one of them is Rodriguez, played by Benicio Del Toro in his Oscar-winning role, and American cops played by Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman.Many things happen that don't seem to have a connection, but we suspect they are many pieces of jigsaw puzzle. Halfway through the film, we learn that General Salazar (Terri Millian) is fighting the Tijuana cartel lead by the Obregon brothers and get them through the testimony of a local hit man. The Miguel Ferrer character, previously arrested by the American cop, accepts, in exchange for immunity, to give his boss, a civilized 'Tony Montana' played by his sidekick (Steven Bauer). The life of his socialite wife (Catherine Zeta Jones) all falls apart and she receives threats against her son and must find a solution to live up to her imprisoned husband's contract, going against the usual trend of drugs movies that reflect the way it affects impoverished lives, driving people into the corners of dealing and prostitution (and ""Traffic"" is no exception).Speaking of the rich, the core of the story is Michael Douglas as Robert Wakefield, appointed as a head the President's Office of National Drug Control Policy against drugs, ignoring that his daughter, a honor student played by Erika Christensen is a drug addict. This story-line is the actual link with ""Requiem for a Dream"" and it's essential to have the health effect, but not for the reasons that you'd think. Indeed, if the film was a mere denunciation, it would have fallen in the preachy trap. ""Traffic"" doesn't much denounce drugs than the uselessness of a crusade that actually harms more than it solves, the film pinpoints some aspects that can easily get overlooked in movies where you get your usual bullet-ridden hell storm and you forget that they don't call this organized crime for nothing. It is organized in the scenes that there are prices involved, the higher the danger, the more likely the bloodshed, but echoing a line from ""The Godfather"", blood is expensive.For all the stakes involved, the bottom prices are so accessible everyone makes hell of benefits, it's a profitable business no matter what and while drugs kill, war on drugs kills even more. Is it the lesser of two evils? Well, this is what Wakefield realizes. At first, he starts like your spear-raising crusader who lamentably fails when trying to display the same attitude toward his daughter, it's only until he follows her total descent into prostitution and when discovering the reasons his so-called partner in cause, Salazar, was fighting with such zeal the Tijuana cartel (and not the Juarez) that he realizes maybe corruption is so deeply rooted in humanity that crime will always prevail. When asked about the junkies, Salazar answers laconically, we wait till they die. Behind the cynicism the real point is that drugs victims aren't part of the equation, the point is not to have 'more' victims. In a way, it's like tobacco and alcohol.The film seems to end on a bleak and cynical note but it's actually more positive, because what it says is that you can solve the problem from the start (preventing kids from consuming) and the bottom (health program for addicted). The light of hope is shown through the slow recovery of Wakefield's daughter and a gesture from Rodriguez that says more than any political speech and is more efficient than any war. As a matter of fact, you could make a similar film about the so-called ""War on Terror' that made probably more victims than the terror it was fighting. But who could see any premonition of September 11 aftermath in ""Traffic""? Maybe I'm reading too much myself but that's how great ""Traffic"" is, it's relevant even outside the context of drugs.",Traffic
36,paul2001sw-1,"Traffic: flows nicely, but with some mixed signals",8,27 March 2005,"Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic', loosely based on a Channel 4 series of the same name, is certainly one of his more impressive films; a powerful, watchable and generally believable overview of the many facets of the drug trade; moreover, it coalesces into something approximating a coherent thriller with a nicely nuanced end. Politically, the film makes the point that the war on drugs is hopeless (or at least, that the language of war and ""Czars"" is not helpful when considering the problem). But it still supports the idea of narcotics as something toxic being fed into American society from outside, rather than an innate feature of almost every society; nor does it stress the imbalances of wealth that lie behind the existence of the trafficking routes it depicts. One of Sodebergh's typically overstated stylistic techniques, that of filming the U.S.A. and Mexico through different coloured filters, also exaggerates this sense of drugs and the drug lords as an essentially alien menace. 'Traffic' is good on the ""how"", but the recent documentary series on Channel 4, 'Cocaine', arguably did a better job at explaining the ""why"" of the drug trade, and was more emotionally powerful as a result.Caveats aside, 'Traffic' is still a strong, gripping movie that asks some, though not all, of the right questions; and the cinematography is interesting as well. In my books, it's Sodebergh's best film.",Traffic
37,g-bodyl,Wow!,9,6 February 2011,"All I can say about this film is wow. This film should make people more aware of drug trafficking issues in America. Even though this is not a documentary, it feels like one. This is one of the best movies of 2000 and I see why Steven Soderbergh won best director.This is about America's war on drugs. It's told through four different but interrelated stories. It's similar to what a best picture winner Crash did.The acting is powerful. Michael Douglas plays another flawed man and it works again. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Dennis Quaid also give out strong performances.Overall, this is a great piece of art. I would want to see it again. I rate this film 9/10.",Traffic
38,CuriosityKilledShawn,Strong movie,7,28 January 2001,"I will get my gripes out of the way first though. The movie really should have been made in widescreen and Soderbergh's direction did kind of annoy me. For someone I previously though was cool he resorted to TV commercial directorial style and Jerry Bruckhiemer editing techniques in way too many scenes.Sometimes this worked and sometimes it didn't. But there was so much going on the film that I was distracted from this for most of the running time. For a film that lasted 147 minutes I felt that it was very fast-paced and time just seemed to disappear.And any film in which Benicio Del Toro DOESN'T die is automatically worthy of my praise. Michael Douglas's character was displayed as being a man of power but power is the one thing he did not exude in the film. Turning into a mild vigilante and not really impressing me with his new drug enforcement policies was a bit of a let down. But he was hardly in it much anyways. It would have been worth it if he gave that rich kid's ass a royal kicking. But he didn't. I so much wanted to see that. I thought the plots about Del Toro's dedicated cop, Douglas's daughter and Miguel Ferrer to be the best moments in the film. It was wise to cast interesting and likable actors in these roles as wanting to see more of them makes the film go faster. Before I saw this I wasn't much of a fan of Don Cheadle either. Most of his movies (Family Man, Out of Sight, Boogie Nights) really annoyed me and so did he. But he was very good here as a DEA Agent. Playing a tough guy character without being bullheaded and irritating is pretty hard. But he seemed to pull it off with great ease.This film gets a definite 7/10.",Traffic

As a former well-regarded judge from Ohio, Bobby has the credentials and the smarts to try new approaches to fighting drug trafficking. But, he soon learns, its complicated. Meanwhile, his own daughter Caroline, an intelligent, beautiful sixteen year old, is experimenting with drugs with her boyfriend, Seth (Topher Grace) and his gang. Her parents seem not to know. Also, a Mexican police officer, Javier (Benicio Del Toro) works for a small salary to try to stop the huge cartels from sending their wares to the USA. A good guy, Javier suspects his bosses are in bed with the traffickers. He witnesses torture. Lastly, rich beautiful Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) lives the good life in an exclusive community near San Diego. Her husband, Carl (Steven Bauer) is, to her knowledge, a hydroponic fruit grower and exporter. But, he's really the kingpin of drug smuggling in Southern California and well protected with his own lawyer (Dennis Quaid). Yet, police, especially Gordon (Don Cheadle) , determined to find out who he is, captures an underling and makes him talk. Now, Carl is arrested and the business is shut down. Helena, unaware of her husband's profession, receives threats against her five year old darling son and jumps into the fray to save her wealthy existence, despite being six months pregnant. Man, is this one tough lady who has no scruples about bumping off witnesses. Far away, Robert travels the country to learn how he can change the drug smuggling, Caroline disappears into the underground world of drugs, and Javier does the tap dance of a lifetime to stay alive. Who will make it in a dangerous, dangerous situation? This complex, amazing film, surely the best on drug trafficking ever, has a mesmerizing, four-tiered plot and a wonderful, huge cast. Everything it takes to make a movie terrific is here; cast, script, costumes, scenery, cinematography, and direction. One more important ingredient is its ambiguity, for it tells a tale and makes no judgments of what is right or wrong, for the most part. Do you love thrillers with a profound impact?

40,johnnyboyz,"As it turns out, Soderbergh can in fact direct Traffic; and does so in this engaging and at times dream-like feature which emphatically hits all the right notes.",7,13 August 2010,"Steven Soderbergh's 2000 film Traffic was based on a British television series from the back end of the 1980s that I have not seen, here translated into a two hour plus opus revolving around a bunch of disparate characters of different ages, classes and nationalities; the item that ultimately connecting them all being that of drugs, which, on the whole, works really well. Soderbergh's skill as a director allows him to veer the adaptation down a number of routes, fleshing out each character and applying varying tones ranging from the political infused to pulpy crime thriller. The film offers an agonising and often gruelling peek into the world of drugs, spanning a dozen or so characters; two different nations and a whole lot of pain and emotion. It is told amidst stark and grossly varying colour palettes, with a series of harrowing sequences and individual shots, ranging from a pair of men standing over their own freshly dug graves to a middle aged man desperately seeking his lost, rogue daughter as he slowly cruises his way through a hostile African American community, sticking in the memory. It is a punishing, refreshingly multi-stranded and supremely mature piece that never preens nor lectures to an audience whom can be young enough so as to pick up on the film's message, and to those old enough to appreciate what drama Soderbergh has pulled off here.Traffic will predominantly revolve around American judge Robert Wakefield (Douglas), and his attempts at stopping the growing number of drug distributors whom operate across the U.S./Mexico border; his daughter Caroline (Christensen), an actual addict highlighting Wakefield's inability to deal with what should come first and foremost closest to him before going international; Benicio Del Toro's Mexican narcotics cop Javier Rodriguez, whom prowls the urban and desert zones of Mexico with beat partner Manolo (Vargas), as San Diego based DEA officers Montel Gordon (Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Guzmán) are employed to keep an eye on the wife of a highly wealthy man, of whom is unaware of the true extent of his career, in Helena Ayala (Jones). While varied and unbalanced in age and attributes, Traffic dramatically documents the fights and perils of each party as the battle for apparent liberation from drugs and the intrinsic link they have with one another in this regard, takes centre stage.In Wakefield's daughter Caroline and her equally aged cohorts, the film makes a point to linger on the potential dangers drugs pose to these rather gifted individuals. Placed at a private school, and initially apprehensive at the prospect of burning up and smoking heroin before going through with it and loving it, Caroline is led in by the bad company she keeps; sadly later coming to have to escape rehabilitation and prostitute herself so as to score a fix as she seeks ever increasing highs. On another strand, we first observe Helena at a golf club having a rich lunch with some of her friends, casually joking about her son perhaps becoming the next golfing protégé; the life of an apparent socialite whose grotesquely rich husband, and how he became so rich, will act as the catalyst for her own arc of realisation as the proverbial mirror is held up in front of her own existence with a torrid sweep of emotional distress; observation and plight taking over her life following this previously sheltered existence. This, as the dangers of apparently playing life straight in the war on drugs in the law enforcement characters, are inescapable, and both Del Toro, Cheadle and Guzmán do excellent jobs in playing supporting characters Soderbergh does well in squeezing out enough drama out of the plights of.The director free flowingly hops from each story, a new tact and overall tone in proceedings effortlessly inserted into the plights of these characters as harsh, warm reds accompany the Mexican strands and deathly cold blue hues the American ones. Most of Michael Douglas' scenes, as he plays this suit-and-tie clad judge before branching out into a concerned parent bounding from locale to locale in a causality driven fashion seeking his daughter, are socially and politically driven; the film going to some extent so as to provide depressing statistics and figures on the subject for our benefit during proceedings, as other similarly dressed officials stand around in the office hearing about it. The extra officials of whom, I read, are even played by real life officials in this field and must go so far as to inform Wakefield (as well as us) that there is no Mexcian equivalent over there as to what he is doing over in America. The film is not a two and a half hour slog-come-lecture with one thing to say in the form of ""drugs ARE, in fact, bad!"" as Soderbergh churlishly plays with his lens filters, colour saturation and delivers everything under this promise of big name acting talent doing what they do. On the contrary, Traffic is a smart and taut piece of drama; effortlessly combining an array of character studies, some more branched out and affecting than others, but all combining to form this marvellous drama of varying tones, stories and content which hit most marks they aim for.",Traffic

42,insomniac_rod,"A fantastic visual experience. It's moving, powerful, and tells you the truth.",10,25 July 2009,"I can't believe I haven't written about this movie. I watched it when it first came out in cinemas and to date, I can proudly say that it's the best Hollywood effort to display the crude and raw reality of drugs and th war against them. Drugs in general is a difficult topic because it affects any society. This movie perfectly displays the horrors of drug dealing, drug abuse, and worst of all, how drugs generate ambitions of any kind of people from any kind of social level.Drug dealing is the spinal cord of the movie and it's told in three parallel plots. It deals with the new American system against drugs and it's new chief. It also deals with a Mexican-American cop who gets into the drub business and mafia even that he's not the typical corrupt official. The other story has a wealthy American family involved in the dark business and how it changes their life including a nasty trial that involves two detectives and a witness.As a Mexican, I'm surprised that the movie talks about the reality in my country. Specially when it has to do with the General Rebollo's dark character. He was in charge of fighting against the Tijuana Cartel but it was later found that he had an alliance with another powerful drug cartel. A shameful truth.Another strong point in the movie is how it displays the crude reality when teenagers get into drugs.It changers everything in your life.Steven Sodenverg does a magnificent job by putting you the choice of whether drug traffic is relevant or not for your life and society. He just displays the truth of how it works in the legal system, American investigation methods, and Mexican corruption towards it.This is truly a powerful movie that will leave you breathless. One of the prime examples of how it displays a complex research towards the topic is Carl Ayala's trial and how all levels of justice get involved.Sure, the character of Javier is an utopia if you take in advance that everybody gets a piece of the cake when you get into this dark business. Take my word. Still, it was a great character that makes us believe that corruption does not necessarily happens.The ending musical score by Brian Eno is haunting, moving, perfect for the movie's tone.The best movie of 2000 and overall, one of the best from the new millennium.

43,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A well-told 2.5-hour debate about the war on drugs,9,28 April 2008,"When a film sets out to tackle a big issue, there's usually a lot that goes untouched, but not with ""Traffic."" This film doesn't hold back anything or give anything but a balanced look at the reality of the situation caused by drug-trafficking in North America.""Traffic"" follows many slightly interwoven story lines. The first is the side of the story in Mexico with two cops (Del Toro and Vargas) from Tijuana trying to catch the area's top narcotics dealers. The next is the story of Robert Wakefield (Douglas) who is the newly appointed Washington official in charge of the crackdown on drugs. We also follow his daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen) and her recreational drug use despite being a straight A student. Lastly there is Helena (Zeta-Jones) whose husband has been arrested for drug- related crimes she knows nothing about. She is also being watched by two agents (Cheadle and Guzman).There is a lot to follow in all of these story lines, but their slight interconnectedness allows the plot to succeed without getting too complicated. The result is that we see so many different ways in which drugs affect people. The most significant thing this film does, is really challenge the mentality and opinion of those who identify with the white, upper-class politician that is Douglas' character. It is clear director Steven Soderbergh wants us to identify with him and the movie as he learns about the harsh realities of drug use in America.This film is most effective in challenging the notion that drugs can just be stopped. Those who try and end it, every character, whether Douglas, Del Toro, Cheadle, they all find there is a big price to pay for such little reward and minimal difference made in stopping drug use. While that might suggest a bias in the film, there seems to be no suggestion made by Stephen Gaghan's awesome script that the war on drugs is futile and that the effort should be ceased. This film highlights the difficulty and in an incredibly convincing fashion.Soderbergh and Gaghan make a great team in this movie. Soderbergh uses different techniques and lighting, particularly with colors, to help make the distinctions in plot lines that are already solid to begin with. When everything appears yellow, for example, you know immediately that the scene will follow Del Toro and take place in Mexico. It also sets a tone for these plot lines on top of that.""Traffic"" ends up just being a really fantastically told, eye-opening lecture with encouraged discussion on the war on drugs. The film ends and there is a sense of the futility, the perpetual nature of what this illegal business does to people, but there is also a sense of hope, that ending drug use can start in the smallest of places with the people who have developed attachments to them.",Traffic

EVERY country in the world which has (proven) SUCCESSFULLY battled drug addiction has either legalized drugs or has decriminalized the use of drugs.

45,jzappa,"Soderbergh's Shrewd, Intricate Drama is Compelling Expressly Because It Doesn't Moralize With a Unitary Ideology.",10,3 August 2009,"Our drug laws behave as a price support routine for the criminal drug enterprise. They do not stop drugs. Regardless of billions of dollars spent and a high rate of fatalities, addictions, atrocity, demoralization and lives splurged in prison, it is easy today, as well as almost a decade ago when this film was made, for anyone who wants drugs to get them. ""For someone my age,"" says a Cincinnati honors student in the film, ""it's a lot easier to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.""Who shoulders the drug law enforcement effort? Plenty of conscientious and sincere people. Also politicians who may know drug laws are exhausted, but don't have the audacity to be seen as gentle on the issue. And untrustworthy police and other officials, who find drugs a fruitful begetter of buy-offs, percentages and blackmail. And the drug cartels themselves, since the laws make their business so rewarding. If the elimination criminal penalties for and removal of legal restrictions against drugs were ever actively contemplated in this country, the opposition would accommodate not only dignified public servants, but also the kingpins of the illegal drug industry.These are the resolutions I gather from Traffic, which follows the drug traffic in North America from the bottom to the top of the sequence of inventory. They may not be your resolutions. Soderbergh himself does not endorse legalizing drugs, but affirms substance abuse is a public health problem, not a crime. Of course drugs generate crime, as addicts steal since they must, and a more realistic approach would culminate in a lower crime rate and a less dangerous culture.In one regard, Traffic is fundamentally about borders and what it means for an individual to cross those that are bureaucratic and territorial, mental and temperamental, physical and conceptualized. For Soderbergh, also, there were other borders to cross, those amidst independent film-making and Hollywood, amidst organizing a self-controlled conception and finding a larger audience to appreciate it. It helps that the cast is enormous and top-drawer, even down to cameos, some billed and some not, by Salma Hayek, Albert Finney and Benjamin Bratt. Their minor but particularly enthusing presence carries tremendous weight. The leads are likewise persuasive, such as Douglas, convincing as Conservative Ohio judge Robert Wakefield loses touch with the less quantifiable things in life such as how much he loves his family.With graceful restraint, Soderbergh introduces the characters in irreducible scenes that simultaneously let us know who they are when the story begins and who they soon will be. In an extensive mansion in the affluent Cincinnati municipality of Indian Hill, Wakefield's 16- year-old daughter, Erika Christensen, an honors student wearing a private school uniform, is introduced to freebasing by her boyfriend, a very socially aware smooth-talker played by Topher Grace, her noblesse oblige ethics dissolving. In San Diego, after a lunch of idle chitchat and foie gras at the local country club with a sprinkling of the neighborhood nobility, the pregnant Catherine Zeta-Jones, with ethereal charm and, for now, genteel diplomacy, spies another possible future after her husband Stephen Bauer is arrested and the family's assets are frozen. In a flash, besides the indirect self-assertion of Dennis Quaid, she is caught between her husband's affiliates, who are urging money she doesn't have to give, and the DEA, which urges collaboration she doesn't want to surrender, while Bauer remains eerily resilient behind bars.Granted Traffic unravels continuously, the altogether amount of characters requires that the film have a intricate framework. In order to function as a compelling film altogether, even characters who never meet work in opposition. To that end, scenes don't just cut together, they appear to propel and fall against one another intrinsically, rhythmically, coincidentally.Traffic develops swiftly, then swifter still as the story shuffles promptly from Tijuana to Washington, D.C., to Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle electronically monitoring Zeta-Jones outside her San Diego estate, then back again to Mexico. Soderbergh tends to discard as much exposition as he knows the stories can endure. Each new scene has to pull its own weight, dispense its own briefing for the greater entity. In Traffic, this prominence on plot efficiency was encouraged by an inspired resolution to give the three main stories different colors. Using a compass of techniques, shooting without color-correcting filters, for example, Soderbergh conceived a sweltering, faded ocher for Benicio Del Toro's Mexico, his performance captivating in his understatement, alternating from sociability to shyness, the film's softly kindling ethical axis, and a graphically contrasting icy blue for Douglas' surroundings from Washington to Cincinnati. In comparison, the San Diego scenes of cat- and-mouse between the DEA and Zeta-Jones seem to bloom with ripe, virile shades that highlight the story's day-to-day nonrational automatism and unexpected juxtapositions. It's an audacious artistic design with a pragmatic profit: The colors inform the action, where you are and with whom, right away.This political crime drama, the cream of Soderbergh's diverse crop, is compelling expressly as it doesn't moralize with a unitary ideology. It is so subdued that at one moment, Michael Douglas's final speech, one wants one more declaration, reaching the bottom line, but, we having been shown the vast uncertainty of the drug wars, the movie lets us accommodate that thought for ourselves.",Traffic
46,bsmith5552,Three Powerful Stories With Powerful Performances Throughout,9,17 August 2001,"""Traffic"" involves three separate but intertwining stories concerning the activities of a Tijuana drug cartel. The first involves two Mexican cops (Benicio Del Toro, Jacob Vargas) trying to bring down the cartel by aiding one General Salazar (Tomas Milian). During the course of their investigations, they are exposed to the General's unconventional methods in achieving his goals. This causes some problems between the two partners. Del Toro is excellent and deservedly won the 2000 best supporting actor award for his performance. The second story centers around two federal officers (Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman) trying to protect key witness Miguel Ferrer, who is to testify at the trial of drug magnate Steven Bauer. Bauer's wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is surprised at his arrest and sets out to find out what is happening with the assistance of family friend Dennis Quaid who has his own agenda. The evolution of the Jones character is perhaps the most interesting one to watch. The third story involves a newly appointed Drug Czar (Michael Douglas), named by the President to head up the fight against drugs. His task is complicated when his daughter (Erika Chistensen) gets involved with drugs with some of her friends. Douglas is then torn between his family responsibilities and his presidential appointment. Amy Irving appears as Douglas' wife who is unable to deal with their daughter's problem. A number of familiar faces turn up in minor roles as well. Albert Finney appears as the President's Chief of Staff, James Brolin as a U.S. Army general and Benjamin Bratt as a Mexican drug dealer. The three stories are treated independent of each other, although some of the characters from the other stories do meet in passing. Director Steven Soderbergh has filmed each story using a different color tint which aides the viewer in keeping track of the various goings on.

47,freemantle_uk,The Impossible War,10,16 December 2009,"In the 1980s American intercities became notorious for becoming horrible slums, with people becoming addicted to crack and heroin. People started to take more drugs, in North America, Western Europe and even in the Soviet Union. Many countries ended up supplying the drugs, such as Columbia, Panama and Afghanistan. Ronald Reagen even declared on the war on drugs, a massive domestic and international effort to stop the flow of drugs in America. America is still fighting this war. The war on drugs became a source of influence to American storytellers, such as Tom Clancy with his good novel Clear and Present Danger, some episodes of the greatest American TV show the West Wing, and of course, Traffic, which was based on a British TV series. The action within Traffic ends up transfered from the UK to the United States and Mexico.Traffic tells three interwoven stories. One story is set in Mexico, about a Baja Californian police officer, Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro): an officer who isn't corrupt. He gets recruited by General Salazar (Tomás Milián), who is the head of Mexican anti-drugs campaign. In Ohio and Washington D.C. Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) becomes the head of the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and sees that massive scope of the problem. His 16-year-old daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen), who is a very intelligence, happens to be addicted to heroin and cocaine. Robert has to tackle both a massive political problem, and a problem at home. The third story is set in San Diego, about Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a suburban woman whom happen has been arrested for being a drug boss. She ends up getting in debt and struggling to survive. Her husband is being investigated by DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzmán). Helena is slowly forced into dark underbelly of crime.All three stories could easily have worked as individual films: but Stephen Gaghan and Steven Soderbergh have done a brilliant job combining the three stories in a really compelling film. It shows the complex nature of the war on drugs, from the cartels in Mexico who supply the drugs (and as we have seen recently Mexico is turning Columbia), law-enforcement in both the United States and Mexico, the actions that American politicians takes, from treatment problems, to law enforcement, and the personal efforts it on people. It's a complex film, and that's what makes it good. Gaghan deserves his Oscar for screenplay. Soderbergh won a Best Oscar for Traffic. He was nominated the year before for Edin Brockovich, which was a more Hollywood type film, Traffic had a more independence feel to it, and is Soderbergh's best film. He keeps the balance of all three story, not letting any of them drop. The film is wonderfully shot, using different filters and colours for the different stories. The Mexican story shot almost like a 70s style thriller, the Wakefield story is shot with blue lighting, giving it a more indie drama feel, and the action in San Diego is shot like a normal American film/TV programme, like the Wire. They is good pacing, and keeps the film going. He shows real skill dealing with a complex script.There is an excellent cast to the film, Benicio Del Toro and Don Cheadle are two talented actors who rarely put a foot wrong, both giving very good performance. Michael Douglas is in his best role since playing Gordon Gekko in Wall Street. This is easily going to be the best film Catherine Zeta-Jones will ever do. Erika Christensen gives a compelling performance as a drug addicted teenager, whilst Topher Grace is perfectly annoying (as he was meant to be).

48,dfranzen70,Six kilos of separation,9,6 March 2001,"A conservative, family-oriented judge is appointed to the post of U.S. Drug Czar. A somewhat corrupt Mexican cop undergoes a series of crises of conscience. A woman watches as her husband is taken away by the police on charges of drug smuggling. A 16-year-old golden child dabbles in soft and hard drugs.See the theme? Steven Soderbergh's Traffic is an odyssey painted on a wide canvas, as the general theme of drugs is expressed in how drugs are produced, how they arrive in the United States from Mexico, how they are bought, who buys them, and what happens to some who use them. It is not a preachy film, however, and that's one of the reasons this movie works.Michael Douglas plays the new drug czar, and his mission is to win the war on drugs. But how to win such a war? And is it even winnable? This has never been an issue with easy solutions, and Soderbergh is smart enough not to give us a mythical cure-all. Wakefield (Douglas) is a convinced, honest man who wants to do the right thing - but even with his judicial experience, he has no idea how to proceed. His job is, in some ways, devoid of actual meaning. He is a figurehead, a symbol to the people that stands for Something Being Done on behalf of the government to stop the growing drug problem.Wakefield wants to bring down the two biggest cartels in Mexico, both of which are smuggling drugs into the U.S. on a magnificent scale. On the Mexican side, a policeman named Javier (Benicio del Toro) first turns a blind eye to the corruption and smuggling, since the cartels are being fought (somewhat offhandedly) by General Salazar, a despot in the making. Javier is recruited by Salazar to join his task force dedicated to eradicating the cartels, and we're given a close glimpse at how such ""task forces"" operate. Javier, like Wakefield, is a very conflicted man. Corruption is prevalent in the Mexican police force, according to the movie, but when it comes to more serious crimes, Javier is not sure what to do. 
Ana (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the wife of a wealthy businessman (Steven Bauer). When her husband is arrested under suspicion of drug smuggling, Ana must learn how to cope - her neighbors and friends want nothing to do with her, and only one trusted confidant (Dennis Quaid) seems to be on her side. But whose side is Ana on?Wakefield's young daughter, a National Merit Scholar finalist and class brain, is rapidly becoming an addict to serious drugs. Her friends are also addicts, and when they get together it's a lot like those old existentialist/philosophical discussions that old-time hippies used to have - only without the profundity. These kids are as deep as a puddle.
This beautifully crafted film brings all of these characters together in some way or another - they're not always in scenes together, but what one character does might affect another character's actions. And, of course, the underlying moral issue of what to do about the drug problem appears throughout, no matter if the setting is rural Mexico or San Diego, California. The cinematography of a film is hardly ever what draws people to watch a movie, but it should be noted that this movie does some interesting things with the camera. For example, all of the shots in Mexico are in a grainy yellowish filter, while the U.S. shots are clear and nonfiltered. This might be to symbolize the differences in economic viability, or it could be that Soderbergh simply wanted to make sure people knew each scene's setting.
As for the performances themselves, Douglas is aces as the drug czar (a demotion from president, which he played in The American President), and Zeta-Jones is fine as the victimized Ana. But it's the Oscar-nominated del Toro who's wonderful as the complex Javier, and he stands a good chance of taking home the statue.The movie itself was nominated for Best Picture (and Soderbergh earned a directing nod, too), and deservedly so. It's two-and-a-half hours long, though, so don't make the same mistake I did and get to the theater late. I had to sit in the first row for 144 minutes. Not fun. My spine telescoped.",Traffic
49,meeza,No Road Rage Here!,9,3 March 2001,"`Traffic' is one of the most intelligent films of the year, and it will stimulate your though-provoking process. The outstanding assembled cast proves that the thespians of this film were heros and heroines. The film takes an intense  look at the never ending war on drug trafficking. The outstanding performances by Benicio Del Toro, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, and Michael Douglas did not surprise me because I know they are very gifted actors. However, I felt I was hallucinating when I saw that the usually non-talented Catherine Zeta-Jones was outstanding as the unsuspicious drug lord's wife. Also, Thomas Millan as the military general was for sure in command with his performance. The highest kudos should be given to Director Steven Soderbergh. He is quickly becoming one of the director lords of the movie business. So rush yourself in the next hour and catch `Traffic.' ***** Excellent",Traffic
50,Chris_Docker,How influential will this movie be?,9,3 February 2001,"(This contains minor plot spoilers so don't read on if you haven't seen the film and want maximum surprise.)Robert Wakefield, a conservative judge, is appointed to head America's war on drugs. Some time after taking the post, Wakefield (played by Michael Douglas) discovers that his own daughter, Caroline (played by Erika Christensen) is a heroin addict. Sub-plots involve the various cartels and authorities in Mexico, a high-ranking middle-class dealer in San Diego, and Mexican policeman Javier Rodriguez (played by Benicio Del Toro in an award-winning performance) who tries to do the right thing when there is no right answer.Traffic examines America's war on drugs in a thought provoking way. Extensively researched (and based to some extent on Channel Four's drug documentaries), it combines big name acting and the scope of a major movie whilst retaining many of the techniques of independent film-making - and much of its integrity.The crux of the film is the uselessness of the war against drugs, but it manages to make the point without making a sermon. This is both the film's strength and weakness: by not resorting to big speeches, larger than life characters or pulling the multi-layered plots together into a single, overpoweringly neat crescendo, Traffic convinces by osmosis, by displaying the facts and letting the audience make up its own mind. But in doing so its entertainment value is necessarily lessened, some of the characters and dialogue are underdeveloped, and it tip-toes around its conclusion (apparently that current policies simply do not, and cannot, work) with an emotionally bleak lack of commitment to any message (such as decriminalization, factual and better researched educational efforts, more treatment programs or treatment in, or instead of, prison). It never declaims its message with anger or wry bitterness but leaves the audience to find its own anger at the situation depicted. Although the subject matter has a constant note of urgency, the pace of the movie is somewhat splintered and our enjoyment is therefore largely dependent on how interesting we find the real-life dilemmas as portrayed in the film.In evaluating a film we could look at a film's value as cinema in isolation (in which case the Director's previous effort, Erin Brockovitch, for instance, is more entertaining), or look at a film because of its value outside of itself, because it makes a valuable point. Alternatively we could judge a film as good film-making because it effectively serves a purpose beyond that of cinema, because it not only makes a point but has an effect. If Traffic makes that sort of impact, if it becomes a wake-up call on drugs policy, then it may be some time after the initial release that such an impact can be judged.The war on drugs has been described as the ""most unexamined conflict of our time"". So is Traffic examining the conflict in a way that could influence it?The logic of the film suggests that the drug war benefits few of the people it is intended to benefit, keeps the drug cartels' businesses successful, disadvantages minorities, and generally throws money at the problem rather than analyzing it or implementing policy on the basis (for instance) of achieving the greatest good for the greatest number. The budget of the South American drug cartels is estimated at 200 billion dollars a year, whereas the budget expended fighting those cartels is estimated at between19 and 45 billion dollars. This means the cartels can afford the best in ensuring the drugs reach their destination and any laws are sidestepped.Laws may affect prices - not necessarily making them higher (low cost increases addiction rates) but they do not stop drugs. The stories in the movie, many of them based on real life, generally demonstrate with unnerving force that the war on drugs cannot be won, that governments refuse to admit it can't be won, that well-meaning people risk their lives trying to win it and that policy-makers are doomed and willing to repeat the same mistakes year after year.According to official figures, approximately five million people in the U.S. are addicted to drugs, only 2.1 million receive treatment, and 52,000 deaths a year are directly attributed to illegal drugs. It can be argued that the drugs war probably takes a greater toll on human lives than do the drugs.According to Michael Douglas, listening to comments at screenings, both the Drugs Enforcement Agency and U.S. Customs praised the film, believing it shows how hard their job is.The film goes into some detail about how drugs are marketed and how laws are neatly avoided, watching in documentary-epic style rather than judging. The audience hypothesizes that people are denied services because of the drain on the economy occasioned by uselessly fighting a drugs war, not to mention the crossfire of associated crime. Most education efforts are still blinkered by well-meaning lies and hypocrisy and, at a time when several states in America are going for legislation to allow non-violent drug offenders to choose treatment instead of jail, Traffic tries and succeeds in countering most of the arguments for the continuation of the drugs war.Under the pseudonym Peter Andrews, Director Steven Soderbergh also does the filming. Various cinematic techniques support the complex interwoven and parallel stories: across the Mexican border the film is grainy and light-blasted, with frequent hand-held camera work - the Washington and inner city lighting is equally key-signatured, though less obviously. Young Christensen's drug experience as she uses crack cocaine is emphasized as the camera goes out of focus yet, like the hand-held camera, it seems appropriate rather than pretentious or ostentatious (compare this to the other anti-drugs movie released at about the same time, Requiem for a Dream, where the fancy edits are central rather than supportive.)Del Toro's performance as a Mexican policeman, Javier Rodriguez - perhaps the film's most enduring character - puts him on the map as an actor of outstanding ability.  His sunken eyes and weary countenance contain a smouldering intensity that almost suggests a Puerto-Rican Humphrey Bogart. His moral disillusionment only adds to our awareness that there is no real solution or ""right answer"", yet his discernment is in striking contrast to the general headless and ignorant policies of the American authorities on the one hand, or the calm self-assurance of the cartels who know how easily they can outflank those authorities on the other. Rodriguez wants to believe, even in the confusing morass of double-dealing, that fair play, honour and integrity are nevertheless possible. His granite-like moral judgement is the film's most warming theme. But, like many of the characters, what he does will make little difference under the present regimes.Zeta-Jones, pregnant throughout filming, brings conviction to her part and more acting ability than I've seen in any of her previous roles. The rest of the cast all handle themselves well without hogging stage centre. The overall result, under Soderbergh's skillful direction, is an awesome movie.Soderbergh keeps us guessing what he will do next - after Sex Lies and Videotape, Out of Sight, and Erin Brockovitch, Traffic is his most ambitious and complex film to date. Soderbergh does not, himself, favour legalizing drugs, but believes addiction is a public health issue rather than a crime. The film also tends to the view that rational rather than emotive policy would bring down the crime rate and result in a safer society. Soderbergh is a well-respected director and his name somehow brings a confidence to a narrative - one commentator remarked how it was a good job he did this film before it was tackled by someone else . . . like Oliver Stone . ..Time will tell how important a landmark Traffic is. Cinematically it is a powerful and mature work that will spark off different thoughts in different viewers. It just about avoids falling between the two stools of thriller and documentary and, although its greatest weakness, this is perhaps also its most defining strength.",Traffic

53,slokes,Una Pesadilla Mas Fea...,7,27 August 2005,"The opening scene of ""Traffic"" introduces us to two men on a lonely desert road near Tijuana, one of whom, Javier Rodriquez, tells of ""a nightmare most ugly"" he had the night before, of seeing his own mother with a plastic bag over her head. He spits to get the taste of it out of his mouth.A nightmare is what follows, in triplicate, each shot in its own moody, surreal style, presenting various aspects of the war on drugs within the disturbing context of family. In Mexico, Javier (Benicio Del Toro) finds himself dealing with some suspicious lawmen, and a brother-like partner he is no longer sure he can trust. In San Diego, Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) struggles to keep her family together after her husband is fingered for cocaine trafficking. Finally, in Cincinnati, ambitious judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is named the nation's drug czar at the same time his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) discovers the joys of freebasing.""Traffic"" is part-white paper, part-""Miami Vice"" episode, part-afterschool special. Even though the parts aren't always that great on their own, the mosaic-like effect created by writer Stephen Gaghan and director Steven Soderbergh adds up to an often-compelling whole, as an array of compelling characters weave in and out of each other's stories ""Magnolia""-style.The resemblance of ""Traffic"" to a P.T. Anderson film is cemented near the beginning when we see two familiar faces from Anderson's ""Boogie Nights,"" Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle, a.k.a. Maurice and Buck, walking into the middle of what turns out to be a very screwed-up drug bust. Alternately comic and harrowing, and very real-feeling, it's a standout sequence in a movie with several such highlights.Cheadle and Guzman have the best time with their characters, while Del Toro won a well-deserved supporting actor Oscar for the harrowing ride of conscience he gives viewers as Javier. Most of the other acting is very good, even smaller roles handled by James Brolin (as Wakefield's predecessor) and Miguel Ferrer as the guy with whom Guzman and Cheadle's characters tangle. Topher Grace is also worth singling out as a smarmy preppie who gulls Caroline into the high life as an extension of his own ego-stoking, a real breakout performance from this generation's Michael J. Fox.The central message of ""Traffic"" is that of family, of how drugs kill family connections, how drugs compromise them. It's not arguing for legalization, or tougher laws, but rather makes a probing, non-finger-pointing case for how families and governments need to work together to destroy the source of drug use, their sinister appeal to those in crisis.I think it's a good message. I think this is a good film. That said, there are things I'm not impressed by. Zeta-Jones' sketchy characterization of a Welsh soccer Mom who transforms herself into Pablo Escobar, weakly written, is not helped by an inert performance. Just watch her attempt at registering surprise when Dennis Quaid tells her what her hubby really does. Zeta-Jones is good in other roles; here she's miscast.And what can you say about the unrealistically sloppy way the police guard their ace informant? Even the Dallas Police Department did better with Lee Harvey Oswald; they only screwed up once. A lot of bloviating and speechifying slows this film down, especially in the form of an unrealistic public breakdown Judge Wakefield has near the end, where he agonizes about how we can fight a war when the enemy is your own family. As Cheadle asks at one point, ""What, are we on 'Larry King' or something?"" But I like the film's message, the way it delivers it, the fine acting and occasionally powerful vignettes. Soderbergh is clearly a filmmaker of great power, and ""Traffic"" often delivers great things. It's not a great movie, or even at moments a very good one, but it's a worthwhile film to see, and see again.",Traffic

While some of the representations seem to be caricaturized, the film is quite decent in most respects.

55,Boyo-2,"Noteworthy for Del Toro's heartfelt, Oscar winning performance",7,31 July 2002,"I enjoyed this movie even though I didn't buy a lot of it.  Its a solid piece of movie-making but is not profound or unforgettable or a masterpiece or anything like that.  Most of this will openly discuss important plot points/characters, so beware..Most of the value I got from it came from Benicio Del Toro's performance as a man doing the right thing.  He's a silent hero, he's humble and just wants to be allowed to be the police officer he wants to be.  He's sacrificed money to do this work because he thinks its important.  As he explains, he wants to be able to watch kids in the park, playing baseball, in a safe environment.  That's all he wants and he knows the high price to be paid for that.  He's the good guy without the parade or the woman waiting in the doorway or the swell of music.  Benicio is terrific and supplies the movie with what little soul it has. Oscar voters did a good thing by awarding him his first Oscar.However, the rest was not as good.  I had a lot of problems with the Zeta-Jones/Dennis Quaid/Steven Bauer story.  Bauer did not go from zero to being dragged from his home, arrested for drug trafficking.  At some point, the FBI or the local police or SOMEONE would have had some kind of search warrant, and been in their house.  There would have been some sort of incident in their lives to indicate he's a heartless SOB.  Then, after he is arrested, she is in shock and pregnant to boot.  In no time at all, she's made contact with some of his 'business men' and is giving instructions to 'shoot him in the head'...are you kidding me?  While the babysitter reads 'Polly Wally Doodle', she's ordering assassinations to government witnesses??  Sorry, not buying it..The Michael Douglas story was not much better.  His daughter getting high with her friends is perfectly reasonable.  Seeing them sitting around doing coke seemed authentic, the drug talk all meaningless and fast and mostly just a way to use your jaw before it cracks off, or feels like it..then one of their group overdoses, and they dump him at the hospital (Literally! Was this a small homage to Dennis Quaids' character in ""Postcards from the Edge""?  He at least brought Meryl Streep INTO the hospital, not dumped on the sidewalk like a sack of mail, and he didn't even KNOW her!) and get caught doing so.  Turns out Mom Amy Irving knew of her abuse, but didn't tell husband/father Michael Douglas, who by the way just so happened to be named the new drug czar in the USA.  In no time, she is put into a rehab, escapes from that rehab, is turning tricks for a fix, steals her parents valuables and has to be rescued by Douglas.  Sorry, again..he'd have an army of cops shaking down every dealer within 700 miles, because he, of all the people ALIVE, could actually request and get that!!  So you see him driving 20mph down the ghetto streets, in his $45K mini-van, searching for his daughter.  Its possible he didn't want to create a media circus by inviting help, but since Mom, Dad & Daughter end up holding hands at an AA meeting, it didn't seem like he cared what everyone thought. There were other inconsistencies/awkward moments for me. In summary,  most of it rang pretty false.

If such barbarisms must find their way into common cinematic parlance, at least they shouldn't be allowed to walk in unchallenged.Soderbergh processes his film three different ways, so that the Mexico footage is burnt gold, the Washington footage is blueish, and the human storylines are natural but with a lot of white.  I suppose this was worth a try.  That's what they thought back in the 1910s and 20s, anyway, when they would tint night scenes blue, violent scenes crimson, ""warm"" scenes sepia, etc.  Soderbegh's colours are more attractive than tinted monochrome (not surprisingly), but it's worth noting that not too long after colour photography was invented directors found more creative and effective ways to play with the overall colour balance.But the real problem with ""Traffic"" is that it didn't want to be a film in the first place.  Educating people about the absurdity of the United State's drug policy is commendable (especially since so many other countries, including my own, have a similarly silly policy because of American pressure), but the film doesn't educate.  How could it?  That's what the printed word is for.  A picture is NOT always worth a thousand word; pictures cannot convey arguments.  I don't know how this film came into being, but it showed every signs of having been created when Gaghan (or Soderbergh or someone) wanted to deliver a reasoned argument, realised that people don't bother to read reasoned arguments, so cynically made a film instead.  It's like watching someone mime ""the house is on fire"" during a game of charades.  (Of course, if people really refuse to be told that the house is on fire any other way, it's worth a try.)It's still a competent, mostly involving film, because of the human stories (or the fragments thereof), which are well scripted and acted - and Soderbergh is consistent, if nothing else, in the way he uses his camera. We really become interested in the US drug tsar and his daughter.  On the other hand, the plight of the drug importer's wife is cliché-and-water. There's really no character there at all.I wonder about the scene with the four youngsters playing with drugs - drugs in general, not any drug in particular.  They inhale marijuana and snort cocaine and shoot heroin like they're at a buffet, mixing different kinds of cheese.  Does this kind of thing ever really happen?

But if you have not yet seen it you would be advised to set your expectations a little lower. This film is best summarized as what you would get if Quentin Tarentino and Robert Rodriquez collaborated in the production of a three-hour movie for Lifetime. Which means it is worth viewing but not the cinema classic many have made it out to be.Basically this is a propaganda film in which Steven Soderbergh uses a dramatic story to semi-successfully disguise a very tired anti-drug message as a profound social statement. There is nothing really new here, ""Go Ask Alice"" did it more effectively way back in the 1970's and there have been countless attempts since then-most of which have aired on Lifetime.Like ""Pulp Fiction"", the film intertwines four separate stories but ""Traffic"" does not mess with the timeline and instead of being nicely tied together by the end, the stories barely connect-even thematically. There is at least one story too many and the 147 minute running time is too long. Unfortunately, the best story (the pregnant wife of a arrested drug baron takes over his business-insert ""Godfather's"" Michael here) is the least developed and has the least talented cast.Except for making money for its production company there is nothing useful about ""Traffic"". Everyone already knows that the drug war is a joke. Having the prefect blonde teenage daughter of the President's Drug Czar become a crack whore would be exploitative if it were not so tired.

This is a long story and in fact in some places drags - it has over 12 main characters that it tries to divvy out screen time. Especially memorable were Don Cheadle and Benicio Del Toro both who rarely disappoint. However the family subplot with Michael Douglas doesn't due too well. As parents they seem hardly believable. And the girl's friend was highly grating to listen to. The color filtering was annoyingly bothersome as well. Still there are some great scenes especially with Cheadle and Guzman as well as with Del Toro in Mexico walking along the streets of Tijuana. The movies topic on drugs is clichéd, and the message on the war on drugs goes without saying that its pervasiveness and negative affects on people close to you make it sort of an ineffectual campaign.

There was a cheesy picture and a terrible soundtrack. All the camera work is shot by hand and we can talk here from a low-budget-movie. Perhaps the director wanted to create a film-documentary atmosphere but it didn't work. The whole story could have been told in a shorter way. There was absolutely no action and no suspense and that should be very important to entertain the audience. Okay the film shows us the problem with the drugs between California and Mexico and that hits an interesting theme. I think this movie is worth showing in all schools.

We are seeing successively its pieces and try to put them together which we can do easily because they really match very well with each other: the cops (corrupt or honest), the chief of the fight against drug whose daughter is an addict herself, the highbrow addicts, the dealers, etc. One character says at a given point something like that: the war against drugs is a lost war for the governments because it is being fought almost exclusively on the side of production and distribution and not on the side of consumption. And it seems that the head of that fight in the movie finishes to understand that. And I add: to fight that war on the side of the consumption it is nor enough to act upon the individual or potential consumers. It is necessary to change the society and its present values to make life attractive for the youngsters making them to prefer living in a world without drugs than in one where the only way to evade its poor values is by creating artificial paradises to live in.

64,DeeNine-2,Very well done,8,6 August 2001,"Obviously this is first and foremost an entertainment. We don't want to be confused about that. But director Steven Soderbergh does have a didactic point, and it's one I agree with. The ""war"" on drugs will never be won with guns or law enforcement. We can see this in the extraordinary sequence in which Michael Douglas, playing the newly appointed drug czar of the United States, steps away from his job and returns to his family. He stops his speech and simply asks how can we fight a war in which the enemies are members of our own family?Better yet, he might have asked, how can we fight a war when the enemy is ourself?Soderbergh carefully avoids the appearance of taking sides, but the ending makes it clear that the ""war"" will go on; indeed the war has become institutionalized, a way of life for us and those involved in it. In some sense the war on drugs has become an entertainment for couch potatoes napping in front of the TV, as well as a patriotic rallying point for others.I thought Michael Douglas gave one of his finest performances, and Benicio Del Toro as the Tijuana cop torn between what he believes is right and the reality of his situation, was excellent. The hauntingly beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones was chillingly effective as a woman without morality, a sociopath with the survival instincts of a hyena. Dennis Quaid, hardly recognizable without the grin, was competent as a sleazy lawyer who gambled big time and lost. Don Cheadle as the ""solider"" in the war who loves the battle, the ""war lover,"" so to speak, was intriguing. Erika Christensen deserves special praise for her compellingly true portrayal of an insecure teen who finds escape in the little death of heroin.But I wonder if the average person seeing this movie realizes what the message is, that the war on drugs is a fraud. Like the war in Vietnam it is a war that is, without changing the very nature of our society, unwinnable. It is a bureaucratic monstrosity that we have created because we need an evil we can hate.There is no ""solution"" to the ""drug problem"" because there is no solution to human nature. A better approach to keeping the problem at a manageable level would be decriminalization and a massive program of education. Why doesn't this happen? First, because the entrenched bureaucracy that has a vested interest in maintaining its position. Second, because the old ""moral majority"" in this country, people who imagine that they know the truth, and have the right to regulate the morality of others, will not allow it to end.They need a target for their hate. Note well that Douglas came home and renewed his efforts as a father because he realized that that is where he failed, as a father, and that is where we as a nation are failing. Education begins at home. If you don't know what kind of drugs your children are doing, then, as a parent, you don't know anything.Soderbergh tells this tragic story in a somewhat simplistic, but ultimately, very effective way. The use of tinted filters to lend atmosphere and perhaps to help orient the viewer did not bother me, but I agree with those who found them unnecessary and not particularly effective. On the other hand I thought the use of hand held cameras lend an intensity and immediacy to the action. Note that one of Soderbergh's techniques is to show just a partial view of the action, such as just the guns and the hands and arms of the killers as Dennis Quiad puts down the phone. We know what is going to happen from seeing only that much, and so does Quiad. In fact, this is the way we sometimes view the world, the salient objects in our view register and we act. Soderbergh's technique of showing the ""war"" at various levels and in differing environments and from differing points of view was obvious but nonetheless very effective.But Soderbergh did not go far enough. Instead of showing the vulnerability of a judge with a junkie for a daughter, he might have had the local police catch her trafficking out of her house and had them unconstitutionally seize his property. Maybe then the message would get home to the American people that the war on drugs has the potential to become a threat to our democracy and our republican form of government.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Warning***possible light spoilers ahead**** However, with all the story lines and inept sound ( I missed a lot of the dialogue)I started to lose track of the threads and had to suspend my disbelief at the following: The daughter's recovery from drug addiction is a little too pat, the wife being completely unaware of her husband being a drug lord is a little incredible in this day and age and the whole thread of the friend embezzling the funds and being after the wife a little too heavy handed and melodramatic. The plot then hinging on the wife getting as vicious as her husband (along with being pregnant) just went too far for me. Benecio played his role very well and deserved his Oscar. Oh well, I must be the only person in North America that is ho-humming this effort. A 7 out of 10 for Benecio,  Michael and whoever played his wife. Mighty fine acting.",Traffic
67,Screen_Blitz,Steven Soderbergh spawns an ambitious and gripping examination on the American drug wars,8,26 August 2017,"Drugs are bad, not doubt about it. But the worst and most incomprehensible aspect about drug usage is the complex politics that go behind the dirty business. From the government of the higher hierarchy to the law enforcement roaming around on the streets, the American war on drugs is a complicated business from inside and out. Morals are tested and families are threatened, and the consequences behind the illegal drug business are, more or less, as tragic as what director Steven Soderbergh displays on screen. Capturing its political concept in multiple story lines, Soderbergh straps audiences into a gripping portrayal of a society brought its knees by the illegal drug trade and the violent repercussions of the contraband activity, all while gripping us with an emotional resonance surrounding the gritty nature of a world run amok by moral ambiguity. The film, revolving around the American war on drugs, is told of three intertwining perspectives. The first one follows two Mexican police officers Javier Rodriguez (played by Benicio Del Toro) and Manolo Sanchez (played by Jacob Vargas) who are tasked by their boss Arturo Salazar (played by Tomas Milian) to take down the Juarez drug cartel, on to themselves wrapped up in a double-crossing scheme. A second following one following two DEA agents Montel Gordon (played by Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (played by Luis Guzman) who capture a local drug dealer who in return, rats out his boss Carlos Ayala (played by Steven Bauer), who is arrested and must face trial under the defense of his attorney (played by Dennis Quaid) while his wife (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) and child are threatened by his accomplices. Then a third one following a Ohio conservative judge Robert Wakefield (played by Michael Douglas) who learns his teenage daughter has become hooked on heroin.For such a heavy and bold topic such as the illegal drug exchange, it is only expected that Steven Soderbergh captures both the emotional and politically-charged atmosphere of its plot. In the midst of his ambitious approach, his efforts are mostly successful as he brings the script, written by Stephen Gaghan, to gritty effect. Soderbergh doesn't journey through the safe route of going for a straight forward approach to the story, especially for one told through three intertwining story lines, each of which are shot in alternating color shades to allow us to tell each storyline apart (as if the cast of characters for each storyline were not enough to make things clear). There are just a few problematic elements that lie within his daunting approach. For one, it is a little overlong, mostly with how the story meanders during the final half hour as each of the characters come to terms with their tragedies. On the other hand, that does almost nothing to take away from the emotional magnitude that the film pounds us on once the story kicks into gear. In addition, there is plenty to say about the nature of America during the war on drugs, and not in a way that shouts with condemnation against the war nor clear justification for it. That is mostly kept ambiguous. And the same goes for the characters of whom are portrayed with a morally gray persona wrestling in battles between right and wrong, the best of which is demonstrated in the storyline following Javier and Manolo who face the moral corruption of their superior officer who has something fishy going on behind their backs. If there is one thing that is made clear, it is that law enforcement officers are not always the good guys. Some of them may be worse than the drug dealers. With such an enormous ensemble cast sharing the spotlight, it is difficult to single out one above the rest in terms of the most grounded of performances. However, this crown would have to go to Benicio Del Toro as Javier Rodriguez, a man wrestling with his conscious when he along his partner witness the ugly image his boss reveals behind the mask. Although he doesn't fall into the hero category, he is one of the very few individuals we can sympathize with as he is dragged into a dark and complicated underworld of moral ambiguity. Michael Douglas, playing a conservative judge who faces every parent's worst nightmare: her child hooked on drugs, is powerful in his role as well. The same can said for Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman in their roles as DEA agent fighting against the bloody drug trafficking operations. Although both of their character arcs are shallow of depth, these actors show they have the acting chops to take on such daunting roles. Catherine Zeta-Jones is well with her performance. But again, nothing that avoids getting blown out of the water by the performance of Del Toro. After all, he is the shining star among the cast, despite the fact being in a supporting role like everyone else. All in all, it seems like everyone in the cast had their game faces on throughout filming. Traffic is a gripping, if overlong examination on the American drug wars shining the ambitious directorial methodology of Steven Soderbergh. For such a violent and gritty take on its subject matter, it is powerful, it is realistic, and almost never fails to capture the political magnitude of its concept.",Traffic
68,bobsgrock,A remarkable film by an encore cast.,9,8 February 2008,"For a film dealing with a subject as wide and varied and intense as the international war on drugs, Traffic deals exceptionally well. It balances the four stories so effectively that we sometimes forget the film is two and a half hours. Each story is carefully built upon itself until they all come crashing together. This reminds me of another film dealing with racism in the same way, Crash. This film is way better. Soderbergh's use of hand-held cameras and off-color film is brilliant to capture the gritty, messy side of America and Mexico that deal with this subject every day. The acting is excellent with Douglas and Del Toro both giving the best portrayals of a drug czar dealing with a heroin-addicted daughter and a Mexican cop who gets caught up in a corrupt web of drug dealers and police. The screenplay here is the key, and Gaghan is very good in keeping us up to date on all stories and ending them right so as not to reveal too much or too little. This is a film that provokes a lot of thoughts and opinions on drugs and how to deal with them. The film never takes a side, except to show how drugs are affecting the American youth and getting into this country with ease. Still, the audience is left to dissect this remarkable film and come up with a decision amongst ourselves of how we are going to deal with this. We need to; as Traffic shows, this is a serious situation.",Traffic
69,areatw,A deep and complex film about America's drug problem,7,20 April 2020,"'Traffic' is an impressive drama/thriller that provides a detailed insight into America's war on drugs. The film takes a 'neutral' stance, giving the perspective of multiple people on both sides without pushing an anti-drug agenda. Its documentary-style approach lets the viewer make up their own mind, which I appreciated.This film has multiple storylines running parallel with one another, which is not easy to pull off and has not always been a success when I've seen it attempted before. However, in the case of 'Traffic', it becomes immediately clear that we're in the hands of a skilled director and the film is expertly executed. It is a very realistic film and the characters are all highly convincing.Because of the subject it covers, 'Traffic' is not always an enjoyable watch and it highlights how deep America's drug problem runs.

They give a rather silly excuse as to why he's even in the picture at the end.I really think that a picture such as this can't even begin to understand the problem.  That and your dealing with alot of opinions too.  I've got some odd opinions in the matter.  I've never done drugs.  The only thing out of place I've done is drink beer when I was 12.  Now I'm 26 and I hate beer. (unless it's got a nice citris flavor. :) Iowa just banned this liquor jello stuff called Zippers.  Oh well.  Too late for me. But really, I don't think we should ban drugs.  I'm more into the concern of finding out why kids would wanna go to such stupid lengths in the first place.

71,baumer,"First and foremost, the best film of the year, but this is also a film that may introduce the rest of us to one of the best actors of our generation.",10,19 January 2001,"Maybe it was by design and maybe it wasn't but one of the best aspects of Traffic is that it doesn't preach.  It does show us the potential damage hard core drugs can do to you but it never really comes out and says that drugs are bad, drugs ruin you and drugs should be forbidden.  What it does instead is tell about five different stories that all inter-connect in some way or another.  There is the Michael Douglas story about an Ohio judge that is appointed to head a committee on drug enforcement, and also has a daughter that is hooked on crack cocaine.  Then there is the story of a wealthy business that is the biggest supplier of narcotics in So Cal and his wife.  He is fingered by one of his associates when he is busted and hopes to weasle his way out of his impending prison sentence.  Then there is the story of the two cops that are trying to keep the witness alive long enough to testify.  Don Cheadle has an astonishing performance here and he could be nominated for an Oscar.  Then there is the story of a Mexican General that is trying wipe out the drug trade in Tijuana, or so he says.  Then you have the story of the other drug cartels that are trying keep their business thriving and finally you have the most intriguing story in the film and that is the one about the two Mexican State policemen that are trying to help General Salazar wipe out the drugs.  Benitio Del Toro plays one of the officers and this is one of the most intriguing performances that I have ever seen, in any language.  We'll get to him in a minute.Every story is given ample time to grow and develop and we are equally intrigued by each of them.  Traffic is brilliant in every way.  Especially intriguing is the use ( or lack thereof ) of music and the way it is photographed.  There is no music in the film except when people are moving around.  But never during dialogue is there any musical interludes.  This gives it the feel of reality.  It looks like you are watching either a documentary or like you are watching a Super Eight home video tape that one of your friends filmed.  The editing is so obvious and deliberate that it looks like someone just spliced the pieces together without any care, and yet it just the opposite.  Technically speaking, this is a film that goes against perhaps everything that you may learn in film school.  No music, choppy editting and a grainy look to film that may put some people off.  Others will appreciate what the film stands for.  I am not talking about the message because frankly the message is one that we have seen before.  But what this film stands for the triumph of film making.  There are incredible, grandiose performances and Steven Soderberg should easily win best director this year.  There is no other film out there that can come close to this one.  What is also incredible about the film is some of the ideas and the writing of the thoughts behind it.  It will go on to tell you that drugs are an intracal part of American society and no matter how great an effort you give to eradicate them, they will always exist.  Put one drug Lord out of business and another will thrive.  Don Cheadle's character actually shows his only sign of mistrust towards himself and every ideology that he ever believed in when one drug dealer tells him that his whole life is transparent because by having him testify means that one drug lord is gone but the other is waiting eagerly to break into the same market.  In essence, Don Cheadle and the rest of the DEA are really working for a drug lord. Deal with that, he is told.  It is one of the great moments in the film.Far and away my favourite part of the film is Benitio Del Toro, who plays Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.  We may all know him as Fenster from Usual Suspects, whose performance has given drones of loyal fans hours and hours of enjoyment by imitating his talk, his mannerisms and his whole persona.  I honestly did not know if his accent was that of the one as Fenster, an American accent like the one in Way Of The Gun or if he was really as Mexican as he is in Traffic.  That is how layered and brilliant this man is. I would not have understood a word he said in this film without the aid of subtitles, but I would have been just as mesmerized by him even if I didn't. Everyone that I saw this film with ( all four times ) knew that this was a performance of monumental significance when we saw Rodriguez walk into a San Diego bar and work his magic to try and pick up an assassin named Frankie Flowers.  His smile is perfect, his nervous walk is brilliant and his flow during the flirtation with this man is nothing but perfection.  Then we see him telling the DEA all that he knows and he is troubled.  He goes through the widest spectrum of emotions in this film and we can feel every one of them with him.  Del Toro is, in my opinion, the best actor working today and he should be proud of his turn here.  If he does not win best supporting actor this year then the person that does should just give it to him and apologize.  Traffic is the best film of the year and if anyone else tells you otherwise, don't listen to them.  See it for yourself and be your own judge.10 out of 10- Will garner many Oscar nods this year and will make everyone aware that Del Toro is a special actor.  I absolutely love this film.",Traffic

75,jhclues,Powerful Drama From Steven Soderbergh,10,24 February 2001,"To say that this is a film with a message would be an understatement, because it comes across so emphatically clear and succinct, and it is this: To wage a war against drugs, you must first come to terms with the sobering fact that the enemy is often a member of your own family; and how do you wage a war against your own family?  A sobering message?  Insightful? Indeed.  And, when you consider the implications of it all, devastating. Ponder that awhile and you'll begin to get a sense of the futility visited upon those who would attempt to rectify a situation that affects practically everyone everywhere sooner or later, either directly or indirectly; and it is just that situation that is addressed and presented with no-holds-barred by director Steven Soderbergh in his brilliant, hard hitting film, `Traffic,' starring Michael Douglas and Benicio Del Toro.  The film examines the trafficking of drugs between Mexico and the United States, and the long-ranging effects thereof; and Soderbergh tells the story through a number of perspectives, which effectively presents the `big picture' of the drug trade and the subsequent impact it all has on the lives of so many people.  	Probably the most telling perspective in terms of futility is that which is shown through the eyes of Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a judge who is appointed the country's `Drug Czar,' and given the task of `making a difference.'  It's a pivotal character inasmuch as it is through his involvement that so much information is presented, not all of which is anything new, but when taken within the context of the story has a tremendous emotional impact.  Through Wakefield, not only is the unbelievably far-reaching problem of illegal drugs illuminated, but the attitudes of all of those it touches on all levels, from the heads of the Mexican cartels to the kids who use and abuse the product made so readily available to them by the drug lords.	A man of principle and high ideals, Wakefield begins by educating and familiarizing himself with all facets of the drug trade.  He quickly learns that although he is far from naive in terms of the reality of what he is dealing with, he actually has no concept of the depth and scope of it, like how much better equipped and financed the cartels are than the U.S. Government, for instance.  Another troubling aspect of the story involving Wakefield is the lack of respect accorded him by the young people with whom he comes into contact, not only in his official position, but simply as a human being-- especially by his own sixteen-year-old daughter and her `friends.'  Unfortunately, it realistically reflects an attitude prevalent within a wide faction of our society today; and it's one of the strengths of the film that it can so succinctly capture something so distressing, something that should be of monumental concern to everyone, for it's an integral part of a larger something that touches us all.  Also realistically portrayed is Wakefield's reaction to all of this; the helplessness born of the limited ways of combating what he encounters is extremely well realized and conveyed by the film, and it enhances even more that already overpowering sense of futility.	From the Mexican side of the border, the story unfolds through the perspective of Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), a veteran of the Mexican Highway Patrol; and it's from his side of the fence that we begin to understand the ramifications of the politics, money and power, and ruthlessness that so empowers the cartels.  In these segments, the dialogue is in Spanish (with English subtitles), and Soderbergh uses a tint to the film that lends a visual sense of detachment to the action; it's almost like watching an old newsreel, which gives it an air of authenticity that works because it's incorporated with the emotional substance that ultimately provides the real impact.	The superlative cast Soderbergh assembled for this film includes Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Steven Bauer, Jacob Vargas, Erika Christensen, Miguel Ferrer, Amy Irving, Tomas Milian and James Brolin.  An important film of gut-wrenching implications and staggering emotional proportions, `Traffic' evokes a sense of futility and loss (especially in the final scenes) that is, at times, overwhelming.  It makes you realize just how huge the drug trafficking trade is, and how any efforts to eliminate or even contain it simply pale in the light of it's enormity.  It's like a terminal cancer, spreading and eating away at the fabric of our society; a disease that reduces the value of human life to the barest minimum.  It's a movie that will affect everyone on a different level emotionally, depending somewhat upon personal experience and frame of reference, but there is no doubt that this is a film that will create a lasting impression on anyone who sees it; but be prepared, for this is powerful drama that elicits a sense of hopelessness which-- I'm sure for many-- may hit just a bit too close to home for comfort.  I rate this one 10/10.",Traffic
76,CharltonBoy,Not a Cheery movie but good never the less.,8,10 August 2001,"Traffic is a bleak look at what goes on in the drug trade across the US/Mexican border. We see all aspects of how the process of drug smuggling happens from the people who get it across the border to the corrupt police and army ,to the way it affects the kids on the street. This is quite a frank and somewhat depressing view of the modern day drugs trade. The direction is superb as is the acting. Every time we are over the Mexican border the film is shot in sepia and every time we are with another set of people they have a different way the film is shot. sometimes they cross paths. Im not sure the mexican side of the film was meant not to have subtitles but my DVD didnt , so i had to fathom out what was going on without knowing the language. I think i did quite well!

77,KnightsofNi11,Visceral yet human,9,21 June 2012,"With films like Traffic and Requiem for a Dream, drugs seemed to be a pretty big deal in the year 2000. But only one of these two films was recognized by ole Oscar, and that was Traffic. Not to say that Traffic is better than Requiem for a Dream, but I'd say it's a pretty close race. Traffic is a vignette of three different story arcs with a cavalcade of characters who are almost all played by huge names like Michael Douglas and Benicio Del Toro, who won an Oscar for his performance as Javier Rodriguez, a man from Tiujana working for the police gathering information about the drug cartels. The other story lines are Catherine Zeta-Jones' story as a wife whose husband gets arrested for drug trafficking, and she must clean up his own mess, and Michael Douglas as a conservative judge who is appointed by the President to helm the war on drugs, only to find out that his own daughter is an addict. It's an intense, dark, gritty, and harrowing film represents the brutality and futility of the drug war.Traffic is a film where everything pieces together just right. Soderbergh's poignant direction is stupendous and adds such a raw intensity to the entire film. The way he differentiates between the three stories is excellent and wildly creative. For the story centered around Douglas there is a blue wash over everything that represents the cold and bleak hopelessness of the story. For Zeta-Jones' story everything is much more vibrant to represent her esteemed bourgeois lifestyle. And for Del Toro's story in Tiujana everything is given a yellow tint to give it a much grittier, more raw, and much hotter feeling. What could have been a cheesy gimmick to make the film unique ends up being a stroke of genius by Soderbergh and his cinematographers that adds a whole new level of artistic value to this film.And while Traffic is visually striking it never lets up on the intellect and complexity of its stories. The film flows perfectly and the transitions from the three intertwined stories is seamless. There is not a moment in this film that takes you out of the experience. The script is perfect and the dialogue itself flows so realistically and so smartly that you would think this was a documentary. There is some obvious ad lib work going on here that adds to the intense realism the film touts all the way through. Traffic does not miss a beat in its story or characters. It is all played to perfection.One of the beautiful things about Traffic is that within its grandiose storyline it never loses its human connection. Drugs have affected all of our lives inadvertently, and anyone over the age of 16 can probably have an idea of where this war on drugs is leading. Traffic recognizes the futility of the drug war and this is one of its main focuses. Through the story surrounding Douglas and his daughter we find a very human element to the story as the drug war is brought home to the man trying to fight it. His daughter being an abuser was a genius move by the Gaghan, the screenwriter, and it changes the face of the film as Douglas realizes that the drug cartels cannot be stopped, the important matter is the one closest to home, helping those who have already been affected. It's a feat of exceptional storytelling that works wonders to the overall purpose of Traffic.Few films manage to be this intense and this visceral, while still succeeding in being a humane and emotionally powerful film. Traffic gets everything right, and it's possibly Soderbergh's best.",Traffic
78,Bob-45,Like Finding an Obscure Address in the Middle of a Big City at Rush Hour,3,18 June 2001,"`Traffic' is certainly an appropriate title for this movie.  The only way I can closely approximate the experience is to compare it to trying to find an obscure address in the middle of a big city at rush hour.  While much of what is going on is of great importance, much is simply distracting. Director Steven Sonderberg manages to keep everything confusing enough so it is pretty easy not to care which is which.   Perhaps the best comparison is the television series `Cops'.  While `Cops' portrays actual police operations, the technical limitations of portable equipment and uncontrolled environment makes it SEEM less realistic than, say, `Law and Order'. However, `Cops'  has the consistent sheen of betacam under either natural or ugly sodium lighting.  By contrast, `Traffic' looks like home movies developed by five different drug stores.Contributing even more to the confusion is the casting.  After a brief introduction to the `Law and Order conservative' judge (Michael Douglas), whom is about to be appointed drug czar, we get to spend ten minutes learning Spanish (never fear, English subtitles) with two south of the border cops, actors whom we have probably never seen before.  Shortly thereafter, we are treated to a confusing drug sting involving two undercover cops (hey, isn't that the guy who tried to kill George Clooney in `Out of Sight'?  Hey, isn't that the guy who did kill Patrick Swayze in `Ghost'? Say, isn't that one of the baddies from `Robocop'?)  Just WHO is the `good guy' here?  Next, we are introduced to Catherine Zita-Jones, playing a society matron whose husband has just been arrested for drug dealing (Michael Douglas?  Isn't he the `law and order judge'?  No, that's right, he's her REAL LIFE husband? Well, then who, Miguel Ferrer (`Robocop')?  No, it's Steven Bauer (who?), who hasn't even been introduced yet in the movie.  THIS is great storytelling?  `Big' stars doing little star turns and vice-versa in this movie (Salma Hyak on screen about 90 seconds as a hooker?) is another trademark of this movie, leading to even MORE confusion (WHAT'S the title again?  Ah yes, `Traffic'. )The BEST thing about `Traffic' is the overall message.  No, not that drugs are `bad'  (what a revelation THAT would be), but that the `War on Drugs' is the most misguided operation since Vietnam, with the same likely outcome, and largely for the same reasons.  There are no clear objectives and there are too many competing interests.  Like Vietnam, even the name is a misnomer.  This SHOULD be a `War on Drug ABUSE,' which would place the focus where it should lay  on the DEMAND side of the equation, i.e., the DRUG ABUSER. However, the `solution,' presented, i.e., the catchall term `treatment', is not sufficient.  Even though the generally accepted to be most successful treatment (i.e., 12 step program) is shown briefly in the movie, the KEY to THAT treatment is recognizing and acknowledging there is SOMEONE higher than oneself and THAT is never mentioned.  (For more information, read Dr. David R. Hawkins, POWER VS. FORCE). THAT would undoubtedly offend the liberal sensibilities of those who made `Traffic'. This is no more apparent than them allotting the main `finger pointing' to the movie's most loathsome character, i.e., the boy who introduces Douglas' sixteen year old daughter to the world of hard drugs and whoring.  If Douglas really was a `hard nosed conservative' this kid would be speaking those lines with jaw wired together and several cracked ribs.  Nonetheless, drug addiction is a SYMPTOM of underlying psychological problems such as unresolved rage and self-hatred.  Besides, who DOESN'T have an addiction, be it drugs, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, sex, shopping, etc.  Our society's very economic existence is based to a large extent on satisfying those addictions.  Certainly liberalism, with its emphasis on self indulgence, envy, materialism, instant gratification, ridicule of traditional values and non-accountability has done a HORRENDUS amount to create the climate in which a `pill' solves everything.  There have been historical cycles in drug abuse.  As this cycle ends, politicians will claim have been `successful' in winning the war on drugs. That `Traffic' has shown the emptiness of this argument is to its credit.  However, that is just about the only good thing I can say about it.",Traffic

Oh, then of course there's the stool pigeon who wants immunity from prosecution for dobbing his mates in...

The way it is often filmed in strange colours and apparently with a hand held camera gives me at... least the impression of amaterism rather than realism.Do not film-makers realise how important it is for many of us who watch movies that if you confuse us at the beginning of the film you will lose us for the rest of the film??!!Most of the characters in the film are unsympathetic...maybe... that was intended but what really irks me is that major parts of the film are totally not realistic and at times laughable....the incident at the Court...and the eventual behaviour of the Judge with a drug addicted daughter...and the behaviour of the ostensibly respectable wife discovering her husband is an alleged drug lord..... OK the movie is sittable...but only just....and the actor playing the Rodriques part is excellent but apart from that I am bewildered at why this film is being so well rated and received....as the film is badly directed edited and presented with a overloaded story line which does not work and which nullifies any ""statement' being made about the evils of drugs and trafficking in them. I have given this a 3 out of ten and that is generous. Please excuse my spelling mistakes....!!!",Traffic
82,gelman@attglobal.net,Why Can't Subtitles Be Made Legible on the Small Screen?,9,18 December 2005,"Since most movies will eventually end up on DVD, film makers need to pay more attention to what subtitles will look like on a TV set that isn't the size of your average wall. Traffic is a very good movie that was irritating because 3/4 of the subtitles were virtually illegible on a respectable sized but not huge TV set. Although it was usually possible to guess the import of the conversations on the Mexican side of the border, two folks with pretty good eyesight had difficulty figuring out exactly what was being said. Too bad because it detracted from what was arguably the more interesting half of the movie. Foreign films are generally better at this than American films, perhaps because foreign companies realize that the subtitles are essential if their films are to meet with any success on this side of the Atlantic (or Pacific). It really shouldn't be all that hard to figure out folks.",Traffic
83,Pedro_H,3D look at the world of illegal drugs,8,17 April 2003,"Multifaced and multifaceted look at the drug industry in various locations and through various experiences.So much of today's film world takes place among bullet proof heroes, plastic glamour and easy morality that when a movie comes along that treats you like an adult- and even includes a good measure of ambiguity - you are taken by surprise. This is certainly one such case.The original C4 (UK) series, on which this is all based, is actually much better because it tells the tale in more detail and includes more about the people that actually produce the crop (and their Mafia dominated lives.) Television, when at its best, can beat cinema in human drama simply by having the luxury of time.The handhold camera work and the use of filters gives the film a documentary style and I think that this really works. Nothing here seems clean, straight-forward or clear cut. Even the camera work seems jerky as if events where unexpected rather than scripted.The US drug chief (Douglas) coming face-to-face with the scale of the problem and the fact that drug taking is already in his own home stays in your own mind longer, but I prefer the scenes in Mexico where corruption is all around and is maybe the only way to live beyond hand-to-mouth. Great acting by Benicio Del Toro - maybe the best in the film.Praise for Michael Douglas for playing semi-weak and being part of an ensemble cast, although wife (in real life) Zeta Jones's accent seems to wander all over the place like provincial rep.As I said before, television has moved on to do human drama better than cinema anyway. But this is an important and thought provoking film about what drugs, money and power do to people. However I still think the original TV series is far better and it is sad that so few people got to see it.",Traffic
84,kenandraf,Flawed but still a classic!,9,18 April 2001,"The directing of this movie was good but over rated.I did not like the terrible colors which distorted the scenes of Mexico.It seems to be an apology to the racists in the USA for showcasing Mexico in a somewhat serious and positive manner.This was the director's and producer's slick compromise for that.You see,Mexico and Cuba are somewhat taboo to be depicted too straight forward.I do not like the compromise although I realise it is better than nothing.This movie deserves a lot of congratulations for humanizing the Mexican people.This movie had an incredible screenplay,good script,incredible acting and good story.Overall,this effort makes Traffic one of the top 100 action /drama movies ever and must be respected for it's genre.This movie could have been rated a lot higher if 1)the silly distortion/coloring effects were not over used(I do not buy the story cut off excuse for the color schemes)  2)the silly,unrealistic assassin is killed by assassin within moments sequence is taken out  3)the drug doll technology is explored  more  4)The Mexican side of the border action scenes were done more, particularly the Mexican General takedown 4)the amateurish shaky camera effects were not done. Regarding del Torro's great performance,he did an exellent job BUT his character was easy.All it called for was a Mexican stud who can reasonably act.Thus I do not think he should have gotten the best supporting actor academy award.I believe the performance of Erika Christensen as the druggie daughter was much more deserving of the Oscar nomination from this movie.I also believe the speech of Michael Douglas in the end of the movie was slightly over done and came off unrealistic and over dramatic.But I am being picky here in pointing out the movies missfires because overall,there are not too many movies out there that come as high a level as this great movie has.......",Traffic

86,skepticskeptical,"Brilliant, until the final ten minutes",8,21 May 2015,"I really enjoyed watching Traffic until the final ten minutes, which struck me as a slapped on Hollywood ending. It was so bad and full of ridiculously unrealistic hope. Sappy and schmalzy. Really. If the fascinating pastiche and intertwining narratives had ended where they should have, with the death of the scummy lawyer who was going to abscond with $3 million of his client's drug money and steal his wife but instead got whacked, then the film would have made sense.But no, we learn that the highly driven US government administrator who obviously spent his whole life in singleminded, obsessive pursuit of success has renounced his position and professional future to ... drumroll ... attend AA meetings with his boring wife (by his own characterization) and their teenage daughter and former crack-ho. As though that were not enough, we are told that the cop whose partner was killed by the drug dealer will eventually exact revenge, having planted an ILLEGAL bug in the couple's home. Hello? Okay, granted this story was produced pre-NSA snooping, but even then the evidence would not have held up in a court of law. Soderbergh should have stuck with the ambiguous oscillation between nihilism and crass realism. That was a thought-provoking film with flair. I recommend this for viewing, but do yourself a favor and turn it off at the ten-minute before the finish mark.",Traffic
87,Movie-12,"One of the best movies of the year, but not worthy of ALL of its praise. ***1/2 (out of four)",8,28 March 2001,"TRAFFIC / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)	""Traffic"" caught some of the most gratifying praise in the year 2000. Does the production live up to its expectations? To some extent. It is not a movie to take the family to on a Sunday afternoon, nor is it an ""entertaining"" popcorn extravaganza. ""Traffic"" is one of the best films of the year, but it is not a movie for everyone. I had my fair share of disappointments, and I think many audiences will walk away unsatisfied by its documentary-like style and unusual structure. ""Traffic"" is still a great achievement in filmmaking and visual style-worthy of some, but not quite all, of its great acclamation.	The movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, won Oscar nominations for both of his movies last year: ""Erin Brockovich"" starring Julia Roberts, and this epic about the never ending war on drugs. That first film is entertaining and charming, but this is far more complex in its story. There are actually three separate plots here, the first detailing two Tijuana cops (Benicio Del Toro and Jacob Vargas) who find themselves in the middle of a corrupt police force, working for Gereal Arturo Salazar (Thomas Milian),  Mexico's top drug aggressor who wants to shut down the Tijuana drug cartel by capturing a notorious assassin (Clifton Collins Jr.).	The second story has Michael Douglas as a conservative Ohio State Supreme Court Judge turned nation's new drug czar. He has a savage job, as we can see, but it is even more difficult being the father of a 16-year-old daughter (Erika Christensen), who gets straight A's in school, but uses heavy drugs and eventually prostitutes herself for them when the supply runs low. Amy Irving plays her mother whom herself tried every kind of drug in the market when she was young and thinks her daughter should be given more freedom in this area of maturing. Her husband strongly disagrees.	 The third story is a bit more complicated, dealing with the reactions of a typical pregnant homemaker, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), when she finds out her husband, Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), is not an executive, but a high-powered drug lord. He is taken into custody when undercover DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luiz Guzman) crack a disreputable drug cartel led by Juan Orbergon (Benjamin Bratt). Helena, with the help from her attorney (Dennis Quaid), must deal with the pressures by her husband's demanding enemies, as well as the DEA. Miguel Ferrer plays the middle-run drug dealer who is captured by the DEA agents and wants immunity for testifying against the high-powered bosses for whom he works.
	 ""Traffic"" does not have the harrowing, compassionate, hard-to-watch tone that ""Requiem for a Dream"" had earlier last year, which also contained three different although parallel stories.  That film depicted drug use as personal success followed by desolation and punishment. ""Traffic"" doesn't really make drugs personal, although the plot featuring Michael Douglas' drug addicted daughter touches on the idea, and the actors do a good job of making the character's attitudes hit home, but the film is more about the war on drugs within America as a country, and how it is a battle not likely to be won anytime soon. The picture does not capture the feeling of the characters like ""Requiem for a Dream"" did with its highly elaborate styles and camera effects. ""Traffic"" just isn't as emotionally profound as the much more worthy ""Requiem for a Dream.""	Steven Soderbergh does manage to capture an inciting style with grainy, high contrast photography exploring the atmosphere of Mexico. He pays attention to even the smallest scenes. Take a scene where the Benicio De Toro character encounters a young married couple who complain about their stolen car. Many directors would have left this scene on the editing tables, or paid less courtesy to it because it is not as important as many other scenes.  He gets the right mood, confusion of the characters, all while furthering the development of De Toro's character. Each individual scene here is interesting on its own merit. 	A top notch cast contributes superb performances in ""Traffic."" We expect and receive good performances from actors like Michael Douglas, Amy Irving, Dennis Quaid, Benicio Del Toro, and Albert Finney, but there are also some newcomers who shine with their material, including Erika Christensen and Topher Gracer. The actors really hold our attention, and with a running time of nearly 150 minutes, that is imperative. This film is greatly constructed and perfectly cast-it is the kind of movie in which you walk out of the theater wanting to discuss your opinions about it.",Traffic
88,the red duchess,America's greatest director updates 'The Wizard Of Oz'. (possible spoilers),9,26 March 2001,"'Traffic' is, ultimately, an affirmative film.  Like any movie from Hollywood's golden era, its impulse is towards resolution.  A genuinely troubling film would not have had Montel Gordon return to the Ayalas to plant an incriminating, feel-good bug, or ended with Mexican children - the future - playing baseball, Javier's dream of a cleaned-up country.Each narrative charts disruption and rupture, usually linked to family - Javier the policeman discovers his partner and boss are in league with drug barons; Wakefield's stagnant marriage reaches crisis point, the fallout being a junkie daughter; Helena, a seemingly WASPish wife, sees her husband arrested for extensive drug traffiking, and her son almost kidnapped; a cop watches helplessly as his partner and buddy is murdered in a fluffed assassination attempt.The journey Soderbergh takes us on into these characters' lives is at times deeply harrowing, especially in the narrative of Caroline, descending the circles of hell from drug addiction, date rape, jail, alienation from family, institutional therapy, becoming a runaway, until she reaches the very nadir.  This scene, where she lies semi-conscious having sex with a black man, is the film's most troubling - although Caroline is perversely serene, it is shot as a nightmare, the blur on her face suggesting all kinds of dissolution: social, identity, moral etc.; and the tight shot from behind her partner making us feel that he is crushing her, like a slab.
That he is a beast-like exploiter is confirmed  by Soderbergh's own, almost ostentatiously non-exploitative shooting of the scene, no nudity, no salacious opportunity for voyeurism.  It's as if the worse thing that could happen to a nice, rich, white kid is sleeping with a black man.  After this, she is in hell, numb, living in a dazed temporal blur of prostitution and drugs.  This scene is filmed like a nightmare, - and I'm sure it IS many racist WASP's nightmare; it's certainly not Caroline's nightmare in the film, so who's is it?And yet there is even an exit from this hell, and with a little parental understanding, everything might be okay (the plot - a young girl turns to drugs because daddy is never home - is reassuringly familiar).  It's up to the viewer how much one reads certain strands, as drama or satire.  Is it amusing that Helena's shallow, thoughtless wife can easily transform into a ruthless ganglord, or is it a very believable response to danger threatening the family (husband, son, home), that blood locus of drug cartels; is it a satirical point that all white middle class wives are compromised in some way like this?Is it satire that America's drug czar has major drug problems in his own home?  Or is it another moving narrative of an emotionally dead man who finds redemption through suffering and renunciation?  Javier might or might not achieve his dream at the end, but he is forever denied any chance of partaking in it.  His will be a furtive life of identity-changing, looking over his shoulder.Stephen Gaghan's script IS brilliant, one of Hollywood's best in years - it creates believable characters not by giving them contrived 'traits' or personalities, but by showing them in, and reacting to, action.  The connections between the various strands are skilfully done, and sometimes frightening - the mirroring of the two drug czars for instance.  The police are not the usual agents of state oppression, but Pasolini's class warriors.Even the overall, unAltman neatness is based on a terrible irony - in a society where alienated elements drift further apart; where the rich get richer and are all bascially gangsters or emotionally paralysed; where the poor or dissatisfied can only get relief through oblivion; where on America's border is a terrifying fascist state created in its own warped image; where children and parents don't even talk any more; where the President is always somewhere else - there is a connection bringing all these characters and social ruptures together, creating unity, structure, a map with which to grid the chaos, and that's drugs.In its linking of vastly different social milieux, its density, texture and length, 'Traffic' has the satisfying feel of a Victorian novel (a name like Wakefield is Dickensianly symbolic).  In its narrative of borders, outlaws, military, disguises, assassins, poisoning, it's like a Victorian adventure thriller.  It is this old-fashioned groundbass that makes the surface modernity so affecting.Soderbergh, America's greatest director, is like Hawks, Minnelli, or Sirk, a maverick who works the system to smuggle in his own subversive art.'Traffic' is a difficult film - splintered, violent, disturbing - but it all connects and resolves.  The important thing in a Soderbergh film is not the script, but his direction.  'Traffic' is full of his usual themes - surveillance/voyeurism (another frightening medium of connecting characters); the breakdown of family (especially fathers and daughters); the tensions within groups; the dissolution of the individual.  As in the mighty 'Limey', Soderbergh reveals his Western-like sensitivity to landscape, his arthouse-like sensitivity to interior space, and the resonantly mathematical way of filming both.  The explanatory apparatus of intertitles, news montages etc. serve to connect, explain, clarify, but Soderbergh's way of filming militates against it.  The'Wizard of Oz'-like formal division of sepia monochrome and colour creates a kind of fantasy world, where borders become magical thresholds of transformation.  Every  character crosses some border and becomes different.But change can be self-negating.  the mirror effect of stereotypically mysterious and sinister Mexico and normalised America creates unstable effects whereby the colour strategy of one realm seeps into the other.  The fantastic, Surreal, 'Fantomas'-like fast-motion/distorted resolution texture of the Mexican sequences and the bleached, chalky blues of the Wakefield search.  In other words, the kind of boundary-blurring narcotics supposedly effect.Benecio del Toro has rightly been getting kudos for his awesome performance, but it is the opposite of what usually passes for Great acting, which is showing, revealing, expressing.  Del Toro must spend the entire movie like an Agatha Christie murderer, playing roles, revealing nothing.  It is the kind of self-effacement people take drugs for.  He is the one character who dissolves boundaries, and yet seems to dissolve himself, melting into intangibility.  If he's part of the solution, than 'Traffic' IS pretty scary.  A modern masterpiece.",Traffic
89,FlickJunkie-2,Style impedes substance,7,30 July 2001,"Sometimes I just don't understand what the Academy is thinking.  The two key areas that detracted from this film were direction and editing.  So, of course, two of four Oscars this film won were for Best Director and Best Editing.Steven Soderbergh is one of the most creative directors around.  He is also one of the most self indulgent.  This is another example of style overwhelming substance.  After playing it straight with `Erin Brockovich', Soderbergh picks up where he left off with `The Limey' and attempts to break whatever record exists for throwing the most stylized techniques into a single film.  Admittedly, many of the images are brilliantly filmed with great impact.  However, the excessive technique begins to get in the way of the story and makes a complex plot even harder to follow (and stomach).The story is a fascinating look at the drug trade from the perspective of various players in the game.  Soderbergh feels compelled to color code the simultaneous vignettes with an assortment of hues by varying the filters to produce blue for one, sepia for another, etc.  This is not only disturbing, but a bit insulting to viewers who really shouldn't need the color code to follow the story (except maybe for the disjointed editing).  The editing is choppy and the constant use of hand held cameras while giving certain scenes a dynamic `in your face' quality, often becomes distracting and annoying.If there is one area that is uniformly excellent, it is the acting.  The entire ensemble does an outstanding job, top to bottom.  Benicio Del Toro is tremendous and deserved every ounce of the Best Supporting statue he received.  Don Cheadle gives a career performance as well.  Erika Christensen does a bang up job as the drug czar's addicted daughter. Michael Douglas is intense and unravels marvelously as his world comes crashing down around him.  The acting is a solid ten everywhere you look.As well received as this film was, I believe it could have been much better if Soderbergh restrained himself a bit.  Of course part of being Steven Soderbergh is to be obsessed with showing everyone just how brilliant a director can be, regardless of how it might affect the film.  (How producer Danny DeVito got Soderbergh to stay out of the way in `Erin Brockovich' is amazing to me.)I rated this film a 7/10.  Most people either loved it or hated it (far more loved it).  I did a little of each.  If the runaway director had been toned down just a tad, it could have been a true classic.",Traffic
90,khatcher-2,well-made documentary film,8,29 December 2001,"Excellent cinema. I think it is the first film in which I actually liked what Michael Douglas was doing. Soderbergh shows great ideas in his concept of not only planning the film but the filming techniques used. Intelligent and articulate  well, that needs some explaining! The use of modern-day North American English is certainly an up-date on my antiquated British style, as well as the fact that the Mexican version of Spanish was also an interesting language lesson, as there are great differences to the classical Iberian usage to which I am accustomed. Thus the already apparent authenticity of the film was enhanced even more. Superb, sober telling of the harsh facts of the narcotics business, and sensibly leaving out the clichés, over-acting and other banalities which could so easily have crept in. What do you say over there in the U.S? Ah, yes!  Kudos, Mr Soderbergh, Kudos to you, sir, and all the cast.

91,PeterMitchell-506-564364,"Soderbergh's stand apart film, may stall hungry movie goers",8,10 March 2013,"No doubt, you would have people who have scathed this movie, because not much happens in it, or expected it to be like an action movie. As hearing the radio trailer for it, that was my impression. And I was sorely mislead. But more so the movie is a well shot scenic piece, with three different sets of characters. 1) is the scumbags that profit greatly from selling cocaine, etc. 2) You've got the good guys trying their best to stop them from the DEA and prosecutors, where we see realistically it's a revolving door. 3) The most essential story, is it's victims, including a teen addict, the daughter of a Judge (Douglas) who's given long chunks of dialogue, in a part we're not surprised to see him in, although they're better performances. Shot in darker but duller color, this works effectively, in what is at most times, a pretty flat movie. My favorite scenes were with the pimp, Sketch, who was on top of Christensen, in a breakthrough performance of believability, as a Douglas's daughter addict, who even when put in a treatment facility, flees off for another fix, to a place of regularity. Here, she's soon resorting to hooking, probably half aware of it, in her drugged state, or just wanting to believe it's one beautiful dream, and the client's her prince, who can take her away from all of this. But this is no fairy tale. It's still happening today, right in front of our very eyes. At times Traffic has a doco feel, with some realistic sounding conversations, like Catherine Zeta Jones and her friends at a golf club. Although the dialogue involving wine and duck bears no real significance at all to it's story, we at least get a taste of her character, when she's not moving product for her husband (Steven Bauer, one of the better character performances). He's head of the this drug operation, involving a few cartels where he has a witness killed off, and in turn escapes another hearing. But also here one DEA agent buys it in a rigged car explosion. His obsessed partner and friend, retaliates secretly, hiding a bug under a table, in Bauer's place. You automatically know, that Bauer will beat it again, after the movie finishes. That's realism. As far as Benecio De Toro's Oscar win went here, me myself didn't think it was of Oscar standard. If viewing it again, which I haven't for a while, I might have a change of opinion. Although I must admit I found his character intriguing. His partner, also an undercover cop who buys it, impressed me, as after all, this is the same actor who played the dyslexic kid in The Principal back in 88'. James Brolin, Albert Finney, and Amy Irving-(remember her?) as Douglas's wife turn in solid performances, especially the latter, where this great actress should be doing more bloody films. But the performance that really made my head turn or stand up, was that of Clifton Gonzalez Junior as a young hit-man, donning a French accent, an actor who shows true professionalism, as seen in other films, of course that searing debut in 187. I admit, I found the movie grinding in some parts, in ""nothing much happening land"", the sudden ending too, flat. But this film, director Soderbergh took a big risk on, (Sex Lies And Videotape, still my favorite) it's the very good performances from a big ensemble of actors, some of who we saw last, in I don't know when, that make it work. It's enjoyable in the fact, you follow the characters and stories, in realistic terms, like how this bloody drug problem is approached, and the affect it has on the needed addicts, and the ones that try their hardest to takes these pr..ks down. There's a difference between a movie and a film. A movie earns it title as being an escapist fare. A film is a more serious movie, with many realistic themes and that's what Traffic is, a film, which unquestionably will leave a few people, pi..ed off or jaw dropped. I know a guy and his girlfriend who walked out half an hour into the movie. But again, I reiterate, it's a film, and not a bad one, and definitely one you can't term as poor.",Traffic

I'll have to say the interrelated stories are great and my favorites was the Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman story. The actors did all great but with the only exception of Catherine Zeta- Jones acting. Her performance was lacking with entertainment and she looked half asleep when she was acting even when she cried. The movie was intense and had good dialogue and the cinematography was brilliant but the big thing that launched it down was how boring it got.

Although there's plenty of drama and art in the film, you can view it as a pure thriller if you want to, which makes it similar to ""Training Day"". That's important to a guy like me who normally avoids dramas.However, unlike ""Training Day"" the plot was close but not perfect. The two main characters (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas) have separate plot lines that never touch. So it's almost like two separate movies. I didn't feel the ending wrapped up the story, either, even though I ""get it"" that the USA's ""War on Drugs"" isn't wrapped up and may be unwinnable. I quite liked Luis Guzman, who was hilarious. The film's about drug trafficking, but it isn't glorified so that didn't bother me -- although the filmcertainly speaks out against the current USA anti-drug approach.Who should see this film:-- action / thriller movie buffs who won't mind a little dramaand the plot not really coming to a bang closing-- drama buffs who don't mind the topic of drug traffickingI'll give ""Traffic"" a 7 out of 10.",Traffic

96,CinematicInceptions,Soderburgh gets heavy.,8,15 April 2018,"My first thought for this movie is that I want to see it again. I found parts of it very hard to follow, mainly the Mexico story line, but I think that the things that I missed on my first viewing will give me a better appreciation of the movie as a whole once I understand them better. There was a lot that I liked in how it handled the drug issue in my first viewing, especially in the Wakefield family line. It is good that the movie shows the different aspects of the war on drugs with the foreign war in Mexico, the domestic dealers and the empire surrounding it, and perhaps most importantly the individual addicts.One could argue that the movie gets too preachy at a couple points, but for the most part the dialogue maintains a realistic tone that is concerned more with being a narrative than an infomercial on drugs. However, I did have some problems with the long runtime. Most of the time I don't mind movies that are longer than the conventional 2 hours, but in this case, there were enough scenes that dragged that I got bored. There are really only a few scenes that I remember clearly, a few months after watching it, which doesn't speak great to the movie's ability to engage the viewer. Still, I remember that it was eye-opening to how complex the war on drugs is and how difficult winning the war is. I guess that shows my hand as an anti-drug person, so I will say now that this is not a movie that pro-drug people will like. The movie doesn't exactly tear down people who take drugs or overly demonize them, but it is intended to show the futility of the war on drugs, which by definition makes it anti-drug. That's just something to be aware of if you're considering watching it. It's also not concerned with showing any drug rehab process as in something like Trainspotting.In a technical sense, it is easy to tell that there were a lot of deliberate decisions made with the different color tones in the different story lines and the lack of score and the handheld camera. I suppose it was to good effect, though not the best that I've seen. I was surprised that it got as much Oscar recognition as it did, but I suppose 2000 was sort of a lower year for movies. Not to say that Traffic didn't deserve its awards, but it was surprising to me that there was nothing better to beat it out in its categories. The acting was all pretty good too, not spectacular but good for the story. I wouldn't recommend this as something to watch for fun as it's a pretty heavy movie. I watched it because I had to, and while I thought it was pretty good it still got to be a little bit dense. It is a good movie, but I would recommend watching it alone and as food for thought rather than entertainment. Overall Rating: 8.1/10.",Traffic
97,jhaggardjr,Extraordinary movie,10,21 January 2001,"""Traffic"" is one of the best movies that I've seen in quite a while. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (""Erin Brockovich""), this is a movie that takes a look at the U.S. drug war and does it brilliantly. Three separate stories about this subject are told here in ""Traffic"". One of the stories has Michael Douglas as an Ohio judge who becomes the nation's new drug czar. Then one day finds out to his shocking surprise that his honor student daughter (newcomer Erika Christensen) is a drug addict. Another story takes us to Mexico and follows two drug enforcement cops (Benicio Del Toro and Jacob Vargas). The third story takes place in San Diego, where a middleman (Miguel Ferrer from ""Robocop"") imports and distributes drugs, and two DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Lius Guzman) who are on his trail. And we meet the top executive for this operation, a respectable millionaire (Steven Bauer) and his socialite wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who has no idea where her money comes from. These three stories intervene throughout ""Traffic"" and the film moves at a brisk pace. The thing that amazed me about this movie is how it held my attention from beginning to end. I also liked the way director Soderbergh photographed this film (he did his own photography here under a pseudonym). When the film is in the U.S. it looks normal. But when the movie takes us south of the border into Mexico, the camera has kind of a yellowish grungy look. I thought that was real interesting. There are great performances by the big cast. Douglas is good as usual; Christensen is a terrific newcomer; Cheadle and Guzman are amusing; but the best performances are turned in by Del Toro (who says most of his dialogue in Spanish) and Zeta-Jones. Expect ""Traffic"" to be a major Oscar contender.

98,buiger,Not as good as they say...,5,2 May 2007,"I do not find the movie to have all the metaphysical meaning and power the critics claim. I respectfully disagree. I found it to be a tentative to accomplish too much at once, that ended up in accomplishing almost nothing in the end. The director would have wanted to make a thriller, a family drama, a political movie and a documentary, all in one. He has failed to accomplish that, in my opinion. The movie is to disconnected, following one of the 3-4 plots present in the film would have been more than enough, since all of them where very promising, and would have been great if fully developed.In other, the movie sports a great cast of actors and great filming (camera). On the other hand, the music by Brian Eno went unnoticeable. I find the Oscar awards that this film received to be fully exaggerated and unwarranted. I realize that it is ""modern"" to say that a movie by Soderbergh is good, but... In addition, the film probably got them for being so ""liberally Hollywoodian"" and politically correct (especially for the ending where a conservative judge abandons the war against drugs to listen-in at his daughters AAA drug addicts seminars....) Is this the correct message? Give up the fight? I think not.",Traffic
99,AKS-6,A masterpiece,9,15 March 2001,"Soderbergh is a great director; he has proved it time and again with such diverse films as Sex, lies and videotape, King of the Hill, and Erin Brockovich. (I am among those who thought The Limey was a disappointment, though.) Up until now I have appreciated his breakthrough film (Sex, lies...) most, but not anymore... Traffic is easily Soderbergh's best film to date and what a fantastic film it is! I am in complete awe. The directing, the cinematography, the script, the acting... Everything works in this film. Even though one might think that the film would feel episodic -- Soderbergh follows four-five different story lines that are only loosely intertwined -- it does not feel episodic at all. The editing is brilliant and you never feel like it changes from one story to another at the wrong time.The cast... It's impressive to say the least. Don Cheadle (I've been going on about him since the beginning of the 90s), the astonishing Benicio Del Toro, Michael Douglas, Dennis Quaid, Albert Finney, Catherine Zeta Jones, Erika Christensen, Luis Guzmán, Salma Hayek... The list goes on and on. The most impressive performances come from Del Toro (if he doesn't win an Oscar I don't know what I'll do!), Christensen, and Cheadle. Zeta Jones surprised me by doing a great job. Michael Douglas... Well, he's been in the best American films of 2000 -- Traffic and Wonder Boys -- and he's great in both.Traffic is an absolutely brilliant film. I even dare to say that it is a masterpiece.",Traffic
100,Angeneer,Oh no! They did a sequel on Insider!,6,2 February 2001,"It seems that directors have found a new path to commercial success. Take a well known age-old social problem in America, build a meaningless story around it and pretend to have made the defining docu-drama, the social-awakening masterpiece, the ground-breaking work of art. As far as the impact of the movie is concerned, Traffic is annoyingly self-important and pedantic, but nonetheless empty. It's the same emptiness we find in Fight Club, Magnolia and of course Insider. The shock value? Zero. We have seen it all before. Kids taking the wrong way? Try Kids. Kids using drugs? Trainspotting. More close shots on drug use? Pulp Fiction. Spoiled rich kids? Tons of flicks. Nothing original. Or is it the DEA against the cartels? Also we have the extremely boring and predictable family scenes and the cheese-o-rama of the group therapy scenes. I hope this dumbing down of our intelligence will stop (I know, it won't, but let's be optimistic).Apart from that, the Mexico segments are the best part of the movie. I guess they could make a very good movie on their own. I would go for Benicio Del Toro at least for an Oscar nomination. But in general I found much more realism and feeling to this part. I guess Latino actors are simply better. Also camera angles and filters are top-notch, which gives overall quality and partial visual redemption to the audience, but doesn't save the film.",Traffic
101,chrisbrown6453,Follow the efforts to control drug trafficking.,7,12 July 2001,"Traffic establishes that illegal drug trade is a problem affecting everyone. Traffic explores a set of diverse characters that fight against or for drugs, supply or consume them.When judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is appointed by the U.S. president as the new anti drug czar, his objectives must include joining forces with Mexican authorities to focus on the drug traffic flowing between Tijuana and San Diego, California. However, in spite of sharing a common enemy, each country's political and governmental differences stress the futility of their efforts to unite in battle against an evil industry that respects no boundaries. Working under Mexico's most feared crime fighters, policemen Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas) are exposed to and tempted by power and money: the fruits of corruption most enticing to this underprivileged couple. On the other side of the border, DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzmán) savor the idea of fabricating the downfall of drug lord Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), whose wealth has grown unquestioned by wife Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and by La Jolla's accepting society. As he prepares to make public through a press conference his commitment to win the war against drugs, Wakefield faces his own private defeat at home, where his wife Barbara's (Amy Irving) tolerance of experimental drug use has overlooked their daughter Caroline's (Erika Christensen) matured addiction.Traffic follows parallel stories involving very dissimilar characters, while demonstrating how drugs affect every one of them on some level. However, Traffic does not assume a specific position with regards to the production, distribution and consumption of drugs, and therefore, does not offer general moral statements. This is best exemplified in the character of Wakefield, who intends to govern with a zero-tolerance philosophy, yet whose wife and daughter practice a tolerance of experimental drug use. While Traffic clearly presents the devastating consequences of the daughter's drug addiction, the film also resists offering a clear condemnation of any character for her downfall. Rather than prove the premise that everyone is responsible for the negative consequences of drugs, the film's undefined intellectual or moral position seems to be more representative of an overall lack of creativity, as it does not solidly nor clearly develop its own theories. However, in spite of applying a general strategy of narrating its scenes with detached objectivity, Traffic does focus closely on the tragic quality of corruption and corruptibility, and on the destructive power of ambition; it does so successfully by establishing with realism the fundamental problem of fighting against invisible and untouchable drug warlords who have larger budgets and better arms with which to secure their empires. As its conclusion, Traffic offers a comment that speaks of the need to find moral support within the family unit before gathering the strength to confront the enemy.",Traffic

103,bat-5,"A great, complex film",8,13 January 2001,"Traffic is a film that can't easily be put into words.  The scope of the film goes beyond any idea that you may have had about the ""war"" on drugs.  The film tells several interlocking stories with great ease.  First, there's Benicio Del Toro as possibly the one honest cop in Mexico.  He's trying to fight the war on drugs even when his superiors are the main perpetrators.  When it's necessary, they use him to take down other cartels.  Then there's Michael Douglas who is the country's newly appointed drug czar.  His take on the drug war becomes rather skewed once he learns that his daughter is a user.  Then, there's Catherine Zeta-Jones as a well to do socialite who learns that her husband was a smuggler of drugs.  Through a very large cast, and finely tuned script, Steven Soderbergh infuses Traffic with an energy that slowly pulls you in.  His use of color to differentiate between settings.  Mexico is seen in a kind of sepia tone, dirty filter.  The halls of justice in the heart of America and in The White House have a cold washed out blue palor that underscores the politicians take on the drug war.  That it's not someone they know, but a statistic on a sheet of paper that they feel is the problem in America.  And San Diego is given a warm day glow tone to it, but underneath there is a sense of menace. Pretty soon, all the locations start to bleed into each other as the stories begin to intertwine.  The camera work gives you a you are there feel that takes you from being a third party observer, to a first person participant.  You are out in the desert intercepting drugs.  You are walking around the drug infested lower parts of the city and you are being hounded by the police and other interested parties.  Traffic is a complex puzzle that demands your full attention.  The film presents you with a current problem that has plauged the US for the past forty years.  The answers that one gets from the film may not sit well with many people, but it opens your eyes to the fact that perhaps the current war on drugs, is not the right one.",Traffic

That's the kind of movies I like!And then, if a movie has nineteen important actors and they are all fantastic, I don't need more! Steven Soderbergh made them all act so naturally and authentically that sometimes it seems as if he hadn't directed but accidentally filmed some scenes. I'm looking forward to seeing some other of his movies, although they are supposed to be completely different.Concerning the drug problem, I was anxious that the movie could be too moralizing and too negative towards drugs as American movies usually are, but it wasn't that bad. There is no unrealistic happy-end and no moral. And the drug problem is dealt with mainly on a high official level.In case I become a director, I'll do the cinematography, too.

110,OttoVonB,Missed opportunities...,7,31 July 2002,"A troubled Mexican narcotics cop (Del Toro) fights the dirty fight in the dusty streets of Tijuana. A new US drug czar (Douglas) favors career over family and ends up bogged down in moral ambiguity and domestic chaos with his ironically drug-addict daughter (Christensen). A trophy wife (Zeta Jones) discovers the drug baron business after her husband is arrested by relentless cops (Guzman and Cheadle). These are the intertwined stories of Traffic.Say what you want about Steven Soderbergh, the man is willing to take risks. When making Traffic, he joked that nobody in their right mind would bankroll a 40-million dollar dogma film, and while Traffic has more polish that his quote might imply, it is only by a slight margin. This is perhaps the film's greatest asset - that and an impressive cast - giving it an immediacy and raw power that party help make up for its shortcomings.First, the good. The raw visuals and style are truly invigorating, and throw you headfirst into a perfectly realized, morally ambiguous universe. The Mexican narrative thread, the best of the five in the movie, is gripping, held together by Benicio Del Toro in a star-making and award-winning performance. Don Cheadle and Katherine Zeta-Jones hold their ends up well too, standing out among more seasoned players.Then, the bad. Juggling so many subplots, the script inevitably falters, and it does so in an arguably crucial aspect: short-changing the drug-user element. We are asked to empathize with drug czar Michael Douglas' on screen spoiled brat of a daughter, and though Erica Christensen gives the role everything she's got, the part is simply does not work, and cheapens the entire film as a result, as does the way Douglas' character arc unfold as a result.Traffic's one nod to Hollywood conventions proves its undoing: after over two hours of watching drugs corrupt everyone and everything they touch, we are asked to believe that love is the only right answer. Thus honesty and authenticity are ultimately scarified for the sake of feel-good sentimentalism. There in a nutshell, is why its detractors hate it. And yet...For all the aforementioned problems, Traffic a brave film by an inspiring director. It contains weird flaws and traces of greatness, sometimes a single cut apart. It is definitely worth watching, if only to see what happens when the Hollywood machinery is stretched beyond its comfort zone.",Traffic

113,Rockwell_Cronenberg,A revelation.,9,28 October 2011,"It's a monumental achievement and a huge demonstration of the diversity and range of Steven Soderbergh that he released this in the same year as Erin Brockovich. Not even a year after that standard and heartfelt piece, he unleashes this biting and ultra-real exploration into the drug war that plagues this nation. He removes all of the glitz and Hollywood sensationalism that typically fills up a film of this nature and instead shoots it up with a major sense of authenticity that grabs you by the throat and shows you the world these people are living in.The use of different film stocks for each setting is a brilliant decision on his part, I'm honestly surprised that more filmmakers haven't tried to utilize the technique. The scenes with a blue-collar family are given a cold, reserved aesthetic that depresses you whenever you're around it, like sitting in a hospital waiting room and the Mexico scenes feel grimy and claustrophobic, you can really feel the sun beating down on your back anytime we shift focus. This technique shows you that even though these people are soldiers, collateral and casualties in the same war, they are living in very different worlds.At first the hopeful ending felt a little false to me for a film that spends two hours showing us that we are losing this war on drugs and for every win we are hit with two more losses, but after letting it resonate with me I found a sense of decency and humanism in it. Soderbergh shows us that even though we're losing, there is hope to be found in the little wins we get every day. With a smile on Don Cheadle's face we get a little hint at the future potential.Writer Steven Gaghan does an amazing job here, making it feel as though this truly is a mini-series folded down into two and a half hours; which sounds like a criticism but is actually a huge compliment. Thanks to Gaghan and the tremendous cast we get the development and intensity of a ten-part mini-series packed into one film without anything feeling rushed or too brushed over.

114,smakawhat,Brilliant performances in abundance,8,11 January 2001,"Traffic details the continuing war on drugs, by telling 4 interlocking stories.  There is Michael Douglas as the newly appointed drug czar whose daughter (Erika Christensen) ends up a freebase addict, Benicio Del Toro  as an honest Mexican cop with his partner (Jacob Vargas) trying to survive in a lawless land, Catherine Zeta-Jones  as a wife of a drug kingpin who gets arrested and faces a possible huge jail sentence from a former partner, and Don Chealde  and Luis Guzman as the DEA agents who bust a big informant that plans to testify at the kingpins trial so that he can get immunity from prosecution. Watching this film, it only confirmed what I already now about the US drug war.  It is an exercise in futility. This is a great film where every single actor and actress gets their part to shine.  We jump through every scene of the drug war, to Soderbergh's sunburst colour film shots of Mexico, to highly  orchestrated scripted meetings in clandestine Washington.  Douglas, and Benicio are EXCELLENT in their roles and one thing that is for certain that Traffic shows, it is that the war on drug produces no winners.  It only produces bodies.
Although the film has some predictability, it is a very IMPORTANT film and will remain so for years to come.  It's not perfect, but Soderbergh's use of interlocking the story and showing the characters acting ability is superb. From the great main performances of Benicio and Douglas, to the supporting cast of Don Chealde, Luis Guzman, and Catherine, AND even to the minor characters such as assassin Francisco Flores (Clifton Colins Jr.), and General Salazar [MY FAV!] (Tomas Milian) make this film so enjoyable to watch.  Powerful performances are in abundance in this film, also it has a great score that really creates a fantastic mood. Can't believe this was done by the same guy who did Erin Brokovich.

115,B24,Fifteen Years Later,5,24 May 2015,"Nothing has changed as of 2015 in the so-called ""War on Drugs"" as it relates to the streets of Nogales, Sonora, where much of this tale was actually Filmed on the pretext it was Tijuana. There are still two main cartels that control production and distribution, two parts of a community divided by an ugly and ineffectual fence, and two faces on people directly involved in a farcical but deadly struggle to maintain sanity in the face of a community psychosis. At the moment, for example, the current police comandantes and their hirelings are extorting every peso they can get their hands on before the next political machine is swept into power by a disgruntled electorate who know, sadly, that it will only result in a new batch of uniformed hoodlums. ""Traffic"" only scratched the surface of the ongoing problem in 2000, and we are left with no better filmed drama today.The problem of this film, now and when it was produced, is that it is a series of vignettes rather than tightly constructed narrative. The viewer is left with no central notion of why it was made, and for what purpose. The main characters played by Del Toro and Cheadle grasp at thin air when it comes to defining themselves as other than (a) a guy who likes seeing happy kids at play in a safe environment and (b) a guy who wants to exact revenge for his friend's death. Neither carries a moral standard for the story (if there is one). The character played by Michael Douglas has even less on which to base his one-dimensional purpose: to save his daughter from drug addiction. Not exactly the stuff of high intellectual drama. What a shame neither country has yet rid itself of a mental health malady that continues to shape life-or-death issues, preferring instead to seek political solutions backed up by brute force. A movie made today on these same streets employing the same kinds of people could make that point as this one has not.",Traffic
116,Eternality,Traffic is Soderbergh at his commanding best.,9,14 January 2011,"2000 was a great year for Steven Soderbergh, who made two Oscar-winning films in Erin Brockovich and Traffic, the latter landing him his first Academy Award for Best Director. Traffic missed out on the Best Picture award, which went to Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000), but managed to pocket four statuettes in total, including a Best Supporting Actor win for Benicio Del Toro. Considering that Traffic is an independent film of sorts, it is a remarkable achievement. Soderbergh's work is deservedly acclaimed, and it remains to be one of the American auteur's most potent efforts.Together with Alejandro Inarritu's Amores Perros (2000), Traffic also made popular the trend of dramas weaving separate story lines into each other, forming an intricate web where characters, often strangers to each other, interact by chance. In Traffic, this interaction is not as pronounced or life-changing as observed in, for instance, Inarritu's 21 Grams (2003) or Babel (2006), because for Soderbergh, his interest is to depict the far-reaching effects of an issue that has plagued the U.S for decades – drug trafficking, or more specifically, cocaine trafficking.The ""main"" storyline follows a judge Robert Wakefield (played by Michael Douglas), appointed by the U.S government to work towards stopping the devastation that drugs bring upon Americans, especially the young. In an ironic twist of fate, Robert discovers that his daughter is addicted to cocaine, straining their family dynamics. The two other story lines include a high-flying wife whose husband is arrested for his involvement in a drug smuggling business, and a Mexican cop (Del Toro) who finds it tough to impose law in his corrupt city.From the film's first moments, it is fairly obvious that Soderbergh intends to achieve a visual look through the use of color that would help viewers identify the different settings. Saturated yellow is used to depict the harsh and hot Mexican desertscape, while a cool blue tint envelopes Robert's world of cold politics. A natural color tone is used for the rest of the film. As it may be confusing to follow the film because of its rapid change of setting, Soderbergh's use of color is spot-on, and also adds considerably to the overall aesthetic of the film.I would like to give special mention to Douglas, whom I feel gives the best performance here. Sorry Del Toro. But I thought his portrayal of a man torn apart by the escalating war on drugs, both on the ""battlefield "" and at home lends a strong emotional touch that provides Traffic with a measure of human warmth in a mostly hard-hitting film, most evidently in the scene where Robert finds her drugged daughter in a worn-down hotel in a town populated by blacks.While gritty and violent, Traffic also gives us a glimpse of the fragility of the human condition. It works as an anti-drug film, and despite it not being as visceral and explicit as Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream (2000), it is still a timely (and painful) reminder of the detrimental effect of drug use. The futility of fighting the war on drugs is laid bare here because of corruption, inadequate laws, and the sheer profitability of the industry. Traffic is Soderbergh at his commanding best, a film that is both powerful and unsettling, capturing the essence of the U.S-Mexico drug trade as it is, and without the need to moralize.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",Traffic

Part of the film's unbalanced pace in ""Traffic"" reminded me of another great and very edgy thriller that also dealt with the drug trade - ""The French Connection"".  Director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan have carefully created and mended a story that feel completely like reality (and it's believable, too).  The question that I have about the film is who is the main character and it tends to lean more towards Benicio Del Toro, who portrays a by-the-book Mexican cop who's up to his neck in corruption than Michael Douglas, a judge from Ohio who has been picked as the new Drug Czar.  Besides, I was still amazed and impressed by the movie and the effect it left on me.  ""Traffic"" is a monumental achievement for Soderbergh himself and the history of cinema.",Traffic

The editing is remarkable.  The directing fluent and diligent, while remaining stylish.  The result: a film that keeps you thinking, not only about the plot, but also about how different people see drugs and why, and that plays out wonderfully with a fitting ending.  A harsh look at the interdependency of drug and society.

120,nicolechan916,Intermixed story-lines depicting the drug industry.,8,8 November 2015,"This complex and inter-weaving story-line gives a great overview of the many different 'stages' so to speak, of the drug industry. From the creation of drugs in Mexico, to the distribution and consumption of it in America. There is a filter used that depicts Mexico as a dirty and corrupt land while America is presented as clean and sterile. I did not really care for this contrast, though it did add to the mood of the scenes.The acting was pretty good as well. All the actors and actresses did well in their parts. Plus, because there are so many characters to follow, we do not get much character development. But the film does show how the drug industry affects each of these characters and how it changes them. I liked how this film makes the characters come into contact with each other, while not really knowing the other person. For example one would walk by another and not even interact, but the camera would be following one character and then switch to another. I think this might have happened more than once, but I can only think of one instance in which this happened. It is a cool technique regardless. The action is very thrilling and engaging, with each story-line making you invest in the outcome. Also, though many things are occurring and one would expect to be easily lost and confused, that does not happen. The film carries itself well, and the directing and editing is great in keeping the audience on top of what is happening on screen. The transitions between characters happen so smoothly that you do not feel that you have just gone from state to state, or to another country. Overall, a great movie depicting most aspects of the drug industry. An all star cast with a great story, the film also hints at how Mexico who mass produces the drugs aren't only to blame, as the demand is coming from the U.S. Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Traffic

123,galileo3,A harrowing and compelling examination of drug trafficking - a clear cut masterpiece,10,31 December 2007,"TRAFFIC (2000)Top 100 - All Time ""This is an understated modern classic. Relevant, powerful and effective. A masterpiece""When you watch films like 'Traffic' you start feeling appreciation for the medium of film. Traffic is a restrained outcry to the problems in our society. The problems with the measures against drug trafficking; how the authorities deviate power from one drug baron to other without even knowing it. Furthermore it looks at the ever existing cracks in our society. There is this great scene, where Michael Douglas is searching through the deprived neighbourhoods of Cincinatti to find his drug addict daughter with one of her classmates:Robert Wakefield: I can't believe you brought my daughter to this place.Seth Abrahams: Woah. Why don't you just back the f*ck up, man. ""To this place""? What is that sh*t? OK, right now, all over this great nation of ours, 'hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are cruisin' around downtown asking every black person they see ""You got any drugs? You know where I can score some drugs?"" *Think* about the effect that that has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities. I... God I guarantee you bring a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, into f*ckin' Indian Hills, and they're asking every white person they see ""You got any drugs? You know where I can score some drugs?"", within a *day* everyone would be selling. Your friends. Their kids. Here's why: it's an unbeatable market force man. It's a three-hundred percent markup value. You can go out on the street and make five-hundred dollars in two hours, come back and do whatever you want to do with the rest of your day and, I'm sorry, you're telling me that... you're telling me that white people would still be going to law school? Traffic is an important film. Powerful, gut-churning, effective. It revolves around three interralated stories in the USA and Mexico, involving a newly appointed naive Drug Tsar in the USA (Douglas), his family, an honest cop in Mexico (played exceptionally by Benicio Del Toro), and a San Diego millionaire who gets arrested under suspicion of drug trafficking - his wife (played by Catherine Zeta Jones) trying to rescue her husband. The film is tense, perfectly directed and edited with a great screenplay.Steven Soderbergh, in his film, simply lays out a story and lets the viewer make judgements. How do we deal with the 'Drug War'. Around 20 billion dollars are spent in the United States every year to combat the seemingly impossible forces of the Drug Empire stretching across the Latino Americas. Would investing 20 billion dollars in rehabilitation programs and regeneration of deprived areas help the problem more.There is a great scene at the end of the film, where Robert Wakefield and his wife attend a group support meeting for drug addicts and alcoholics. Robert exclaims, that he stand by his daughter. A group therapy session was the easier method for Wakefield to help his daughter, with just a few hours dedication. Not the war he fought, against drugs and corruption.The most important film of 2000 and quite possibly the best.10/10",Traffic
124,Gubby-Allen,Above average (but only very very slightly),6,27 March 2002,"This was stange film as there was so much good about it, but sadly so much awful about it. Now what I know about the deep core of drug culture you can write on the back of a postage stamp, so the realistic / unrealistic aspect I'll sit on the fence with.Loose spoilersBut on the credit side, good acting from Del-Toro & surprisingly Douglas & Don Cheadle too. There are some interesting stories running through. It's relatively easy to follow, carries one or two good message, occasionally builds up some suspense with some excellent scenes, kept me interested and was one of the better drug related films I've seen, but I'm not a huge fan of the genre.On the debit side however was really that I'm not sure what the purpose of the film was at all. In on sense it was far too long. 2 hours & 20 minutes to tell at story that only occasionally verged on fascinating or exciting was too much, mainly due to there being one segment lasting for 6 minutes without a word, just background music, another one for about 3 minutes.However in another sense, the film only ever touched on the plot. There were between 3-4 plots running along. Any one was long enough for a film on it's own. Thus you were left with 4 stories that sort of come together but sort of didn't. The characters (Douglas, Del Toro, Jones) never met up or came together. None of the 4 plots were completely resolved. It was as if we were left to wait for a Traffic 2 like with Lord of the Rings. We're left with Don Cheadles camera under the desk? Well what then? The Mexican story may have resolved itself but if it did I missed it. I can't hand on heart say I understand exactly how the General, the presumed dead bloke or the Obrego brothers were left when it ended & what the viewer was meant to presume.Two scenes severely let Traffic down though, Zeta Jones going from doting mum & housewife to gangland villain overnight & Michael Douglas entering the drug den to take on all comers on his own.Worse than all of that though was the editing & poncy colours they used. I generally don't like that but can put up with it if I see how it adds to the film. But for the life of me I can't see what the Mexican scenes being in yellow & the odd Douglas one being toned blue actually achieved. For the first hour the Mexican based scenes were the best but by the end they'd become a pain up the arse. The film was always soap opera style ie one good scene, but then have to sit through a dull one to get to the next interesting bit, by which time you'd forgotten what had happened in the previous one.There was no one character here to like or connect too, occasionally Del Toro but never enough, nor was there any real resolvement to the plots that had been set up. There were a variety of messages it sent out but no clear one & despite not a bad film I couldn't help thinking ""what was the point""?A low 6-10",Traffic
125,asifahsankhan,Sit Down and Write Two Letters...,8,5 February 2017,"Drugs are everywhere, their presence has been steadily increasing (if it hasn't already maxed out) through the years. But, people who want to lament over today's drug problem lose sight of the fact that drugs have been prevalent since before modern times. People want drugs, not everyone mind you, but a lot of people do. They want illegal drugs, prescription drugs and drugs that aren't thought of as drugs, such as alcohol and cigarettes. Illegal drugs, for the sake of the movie I'll restrict myself to hard stuff like cocaine or heroin, are a big business, perhaps the biggest business in the world. The second biggest business may be the war on drugs, but the difference is one enterprise routinely prospers while the other runs in the red all the time.I'm not going to get into my own personal drug politics, but I am someone who has spent most of his life around drugs and has seen how they affect everyone they touch. Traffic isn't a message movie in the sense that it tries to say this is good and this is bad. It is a message movie on two fronts, first is the message that drugs affect everyone they touch. Second is the message that the war on drugs is being lost and may be more harmful than it is helpful. I happen to agree with both points, so in that regard Traffic is already off to a good start with me. But, it shouldn't come down to personal politics, the two main points touched on in Traffic should be common sense, but they aren't. It's easy to see how drugs affect everyone they touch, users, dealers and those who fight against drugs are all impacted by the mere presence of drugs. The war on drugs is an abysmal failure, that much is obvious by spending a few hours in any local high school. Traffic superbly tells its tale so as not to shove these points down the viewers throats, but rather to give the viewer a glimpse at what is happening and to allow the viewer to come to their own conclusions.Traffic excels in the banality of the drug world and in essence the world in general. The miscommunication shown between different groups of government, the plight of Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, how the smallest of details can affect gaggles of people. At the same time it excels in showing how the most banal of things in our world are escalated tenfold in the world of drugs.I was amazed in Traffic with the relative ease of the story and Soderbergh's direction. Up until Traffic I was not a member of the Soderbergh fan club, but with Traffic I can see little touches that do make him a modern filmmaker to watch out for. His use of colour was not something I was prepared for, but it was exquisite to take in. Each region being filmed in a different hue not only allowed the viewer to know what place they were at in a hectic and fast moving story, but it added texture to each locale. Mexico looked grimier, Ohio looked more serene, and so on. Without these markers I don't know if the story would have flowed quite so easily, nor do I think it would have without Soderbergh's inventive shot selection and pacing choices.The acting in Traffic was great across the board, with nary a performance that didn't grab my attention. Michael Douglas & Benicio del Toro are the obvious point of discussion because their performances do anchor the film. But, I was most impressed with Don Cheadle and even more so with Luis Guzmán. There was genuine humour in Traffic, and most of it was supplied by Cheadle and Guzmán, but they were also poignant and honest characters.It's always a joy to discover an overlooked gem. The masses may not have overlooked Traffic, but I did and I am glad to have finally discovered it. Traffic was a well put together story with interesting characters, a compelling narrative, messages I found intriguing and honest, as well as moving at a fast pace while maintaining a unique look and feel. If you haven't yet seen Traffic, try not to miss out on this gem like I did.",Traffic
126,Shiva-11,A very different drug movie,8,4 January 2001,"Traffic:  On September 5, 1989 George Bush announced his ""War on Drugs"" platform intended to combat the explosion in cocaine use among the yuppies of the  ""Me Decade"".  Good intentions aside, the program was doomed from the beginning: there was no consensus on how to attack the problem, the different law enforcement units (local, state and federal) refused to play well together, and unlike the arms race, there was no way the government could outspend the nouveau riche druglords. Consequently, several years and billions of dollars later, America found itself on the losing end of its third war. It doesn't look like anything is about to change anytime soon.As the new drug czar it is Robert Wakefield's job to solve the nation's drug problem, but he faces several dilemmas: should he target supply or demand? Fund treatment, or pass stiffer sentences?  And how can he hope to solve an omnipresent global issue when he can't even keep his daughter away from crack?  Meanwhile, in the border town of Tijuana, Javier Rodriguez is the one good cop in a bad town trying to wipe out the local cartel on a whopping salary of $350 a month.  Will he sell out or keep fighting for the principles he has sworn to uphold?  Finally, when her husband is arrested, Helena Ayala discovers that her upper class lifestyle is funded by his cocaine smuggling business.  This is accompanied by the realization that she really likes the finer things in life and isn't about to give them up for something as minor as a major felony. Six golden globe nominations, ""Best Movie of the Year"" predictions, widespread accolades and ""Traffic"" hasn't even opened yet.  Is it that good? It depends on how you rate a movie.  I like to start with the cast. Michael Douglas is riveting as Robert, turning in his second great performance of the year (remember ""The Wonder Boys""?). Robert is a committed man and arguably one of the most powerful people in the world, but he becomes so wrapped up in his work that he doesn't realize that his home life is crumbling.  When he finally takes notice, and discovers his daughter's problem, he is humbled to discover that he is utterly powerless.  Douglas avoids becoming the cliched ""Death Wish"" dad out for vengeance, instead he sincerely tries to understand and help his daughter.  Benicio Del Toro does an outstanding job as Javier, the poor Mexican cop trying to do the right thing.  Del Toro's understated man-of-few-words style serves him well and you marvel at his character's determination.  Erika Christensen is fantastic as the beautiful-straight-A-student daughter who also happens to be a drug addict. Her freshness is matched only by the burned out shell that remains after her binges.  Keep a close eye on this young woman.  Then there is Topher Grace, the smart mouth from ""That 70's Show"" who plays a smart mouth, street-wise rich kid whose gift for glib is amazing.  Finally, the bulk of the supporting cast, notably Don Cheadle, Miguel Ferrer, and Luiz Guzman, does a wonderful job.  But there's more to a movie than the cast.The parallel plot lines are not only different in terms of locations and characters, indeed, almost pulp-fictionesque, they are also very different stylistically. Whenever the story is following Robert or the characters in his world, the scenes are shot with ever-present rich hues of blue.  When the story follows Javier in Mexico, the scene is shot in sepia, with the same washed out look that was used in ""The Three Kings"", and is reminiscent of an episode of ""Cops"" - rapid, jerky, camera movements, and quick zooms. The shots for Helena however, slowly evolve, changing from bright locations, to shadows and dimly lit rooms as her character changes.  One of my favorite scenes is the shot of a moving and descending helicopter filmed from beneath - it is striking, and made me feel claustrophobic.  With the good, comes the bad.The change in Catherine-Zeta Jones' character is too rapid and extreme to be believable. The audience is expected to believe that a pregnant upper-class woman who believes her husband is a legitimate businessman can be transformed into a sophisticated big time drug dealer and cold-blooded killer in the space of a week. And she manages to do this- by herself - while her husband is in jail.   It was simply too far fetched.  And what is with Benjamin Bratt?  I realize he is dating Julia Roberts, and is a good-looking specimen of a man, but I wasn't sure what I found more ridiculous - his character or his accent?  I also had problems with the pat ending - everything turned out too well.  And although I enjoyed the stylistic use of color in the film (previous paragraph), I liked it better when I saw it the first time around in ""Tuvalu"".  Finally, I think several sequences could have been edited out, and brought the runtime down from 150 minutes without adversely affecting the final product.
An interesting take on a complex issue, and definitely worth seeing",Traffic
127,JoshtheGiant,Powerful,9,20 October 2005,"Traffic is a very powerful and scary film. It is also very honest about drugs, and the lives of people who have been basically ruined because of them, the best film of it's kind since Pulp Fiction. The story is amazing, well the stories are amazing because there are about three different stories, and many lead characters in each one, this would have ruined most films. But with a screenplay this good you could have almost any story and it would be great, the dialogue is amazing. The screenwriter also seems to understand all the different angles of the drug world as well as all the different places this film shows. The acting is fantastic. Benicio Del Toro, Michael Douglas, Erika Christensen, and Topher Grace are the standouts, I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the last two can actually act.

128,coop-16,"One brilliant film, two good , but flawed ones, combined...",9,3 February 2001,"The problem with reviewing Traffic is that it is not one film, but three films  in one. While that might work with the Holy Trinity,it is dangerous to try on screen.Soderbergh, however, does pull it off..the total film IS more than the sum of its parts. There are three narrative threads.The first, and the best thread, is set in Mexico, using Mexican actors, and  ayellow filter. Here, Benicio Del Toro gives a performance as a morally ambiguous, but strangely dedicated Narcotics cop that is nothing short of brilliant.The second thread is  police procedural of a different sort, with the DEA going after  a drug kingpin and his wife. This thread is shot in rich, glowing colors, almost  a parody of Miami Vice. The best things in this sequence are a terrific performances by Don Cheadle, as a skeptical DEA agent, and Miguel Ferrer as an extremely articulate ""informer"" who offers a devestating critique of U.S. drug policies.The biggest weakness of this sequence is a flat performance by Dennis Quaid as, the drug king pins double-crossing ""best friend"".Catherine  Zeta-Jones is surprisingly good,as the drug -king-pins wife, who begins the story as a sweet-natured, charnming society lady and has degenerated into a cold-blooded criminal master-mind by the end.  The third thread is probably the one that will have the greatest emotional impact on American audiences, as it shows the impact of drugs on ""middle America"". It is also I thought, the weakest sequence.Micheal Douglas plays a conservative Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, who  gets named federal drug czar, probably by the Bush administration.Ironically, he is so wrapped up with the war on drugs that he doesnt notice that his gifted, charming young daughter is ON drugs. Douglas and his wife ( played by the recently invisible Amy Irving) finally manage to get her into treatment. This thread is hurt by some cliched sequences and an unsubtle performance by Douglas. However, even here, there were good things.Topher Grace gives a truly fine performance as a preppy drug pusher. Albert Finney is effective in a cameo as the President's Chief of Staff. There is also an amusing sequence early on when Douglas is a t a party, getting advice from various U.S. Senators-Hatch, Nickles, Reid, Grassley( who merely smiles and nods his head vigorously as Orrin holds forth)and Boxer.This sequence may be the first time since Advise and Consent when political conservatives have actually been portrayed in an Hollywood film as saying intelligent things.

130,MF210,An Amazing Movie,10,7 September 2003,"My Rating:**** out of ****.When I saw Traffic I thought it was a great film. It has Great Performances, Great Script, Great Cinematography, and Masterful Direction. Traffic may be depressing for some people because this is real life right here. This movie shows teenagers on drugs, drug cartels, and the effects of a woman whose husband is a drug dealer. Traffics acting is one of its best strengths. Michael Douglas leads the pack with a good, solid performance. Catherine Zeta-Jones really impressed me here, I thought she should have been nominated. She played a naive wife of a drug dealer, then became more authorative when her life and family were in danger. Benico Del Toro turns in a brilliant performance as a Mexican Cop. Erika Christiensen is Great here too as the drug-addicted teenager.
The Cinematography is great in Traffic. The yellowish color of Mexico represents the climate but also represents it as a ""hot"" place for crime. The Blue of Ohio represents that its a depressing place, with teenagers getting drugged up. California has a more normal color, which I think means that this could be anywhere, it doesnt really have a depressing or ""hot"" feel for it.

131,Gideon24,Why the war on drugs is a war we're losing,8,2 March 2015,"The year 2000 brought us two very different films centering around drug addiction and the war against drugs.Traffic is a sweeping epic that flawlessly weaves three separate stories together in an incisive examination into the war against drugs and how it is a battle that, no matter what we do, we will continue to lose.One story revolves around a judge, played by Michael Douglas, who is appointed by the President of the United States to be the new Drug Czar and as serious as he is about his job, his neglect of his home life is revealed to have its own consequences as it is revealed that his own daughter has become addicted to crack cocaine, an addiction that has led her to selling her body to a drug dealer in order to continue getting high.Another story involves the pregnant trophy wife of a major drug trafficker (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who has tried to turn a blind eye to what her husband does, but when her husband is arrested and facing serious jail time, she opens her eyes and takes charge up to the point of ordering a hit on the primary witness against her husband and continuing to negotiate international deals to keep her husband's product moving.Benecio Del Toro won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in the third story, a somewhat corrupt Mexican border cop who finds out his new boss is not who he thinks he is and how his work has put himself and his best friend (Jacob Vargas) in serious danger.Director Steven Soderbergh blindsided Ridley Scott by winning the Best Director Oscar for his brilliant weaving of these stories together, which also includes riveting turns by Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman as cops assigned to keep their key witness against Zeta-Jones' husband in one piece. Though Del Toro won the supporting actor Oscar, I personally would have given it to Cheadle, who is just magnificent here. Erika Christensen is very effective as Douglas' daughter as is Dennis Quaid as Zeta-Jones' husband's sleazy attorney, who has always had his own agenda regarding his boss and his boss' wife. Miguel Ferrer also scores as the witness Cheadle and Guzman are assigned to protect.Soderberg proved to be a master cinematic storyteller with this compelling drama told on a large canvas that sustains interest and stirs emotions in equal doses, a sobering indictment regarding a war that we continue to be in denial about losing.",Traffic

It truly is hard to know where to begin, and imdb's 1000 word limit truly limits me. I really only have one question and please email me with the answer if you know it. Who do I sue to get my money back?1) Numbingly long. 2 hours and 40 minutes of painful, boring, incomprehensible, crap! Typical film maker who thinks if he bores you long enough, he will get the critic's to start wondering if there is something here. And, the sheep will surely follow!2) 3-4 story lines that are largely unrelated to each other. If you like a garbled mini documentary styled movie then this is it. If you are like me and want to go see a movie that has a beginning, a middle, and an end where all story lines are related somehow, then this is the LAST movie you want to go to.3) THE WORST CAMERA WORK IN THE HISTORY OF FILM!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely no exception to that and I challenge anyone to show me one that is worse. For one thing, every scene in Mexico was visually washed out. The theory, I suppose is to somehow try to convey the washed out nature of Mexico. But, I got news for you. IT WAS IRRITATING AS HELL! Also, the camera was CONSTANTLY jumping around on every single scene at every single second. I needed dramamine just to keep from getting sick. Thought I was watching a jeans commercial for 160 minutes. I suppose the theory is that it gives it that edgy feel. Well, I got news for you. IT WAS AS IRRITATING AS HELL! And, then there were hundreds of times when it was intentionally out of focus on specific characters or surroundings. I suppose that the theory is that it makes things less ""clear"" in this muddled druggie world. Well, I got news for you. Yeah, you guessed it. IT WAS AS IRRITATING AS HELL!4) If I want to go to a movie to see Zeda-Jones, I'm not going to see her pregnant. Comprendo? And, Amy Irving has never looked worse. In fact, she has never come close to looking even as bad. Just so I'm not totally sexist, Peter Reigert was a true stick figure. Cheadle and Douglas gave good performances, but Douglas always does and this wasn't his best.5) Can't begin to tell you how many ludicrous things happened. Like we are going to believe that a teenager is going to start spouting statistics to the drug czar in the front seat of his car while he is looking desperately for his daughter. Like we are going to believe that a self-professed non independent woman is going to suddenly become a drug kingpin in place of her jailed husband - without his help no less. Like we are going to believe that a drug czar is going to give a speech to the Washington press and then stutter like first grader caught stealing out of his momma's purse - only to spout the pat ""I can't do this.""

He lives in an affluent bedroom community in suburban Cincinnati, despite all his money, he can afford to ride around in something better, yet he just drives a Cadillac, and he gets snookered on Scotch, what makes me think he is a Republican? I will give you odds!!...So what is the basic political party generalization of a Republican anyway? You eat oatmeal six times a day, and your sofa and drapes match each other with that really hideous plaid pattern!!!...You don't have sex past age 32 and your kids don't do drugs, right?...That is for those Long Island Liberals who are afflicted by sociological curiosity!!....You are labeled a pro-society sap head(this word is a G-rated replacement for the real one) your daughter does not even mind this stereotype, it is just that she is bored!! Spending gobs of money at the mall no longer amuses her!! So!! as a result, her spoiled adolescent cliques all have the desire to do dangerous drugs, furthermore, this year it is in-Vogue to hate your father!!This movie has a single culprit, DRUGS!! It (this movie) evokes a potpourri of pecuniary monsters who are morally bankrupt, their only real opposition to the Mexican Drug Cartel is that they want residuals!! Other running characters include: The aging GQ attorney who is a sleaze ball, the executive housewife, who is burdened by malaise, which means she is avaricious beyond imagination, and of course. there is the pusillanimous aura of the Country Club set who exemplify the term despondence, and make it extremely lethal!! Nauseating reality persists, Law School does not make sense because of drugs and money!! The Drug Cartel has the profit numbers to put it in the Fortune 500 category, hence, it acts like a Fortune 500 Corporation!!! Irrational logic patterns of drug induced behavior lead to violent confrontations, some people get killed, but what is the real impact of such deaths? Put it this way, I just killed a mosquito!!The film ""Traffic"" exudes reality to an unprecedented rudeness level!! Ultimately, Mr Conservative Politician realizes his family is deluged with catastrophe!! He is scared senseless (another G-Rated replacement for the real word here!!) Truly indicative of a politician's inflated ego, his problems have to be heard by a solicitous audience!! This film is tremendous, and it astutely effectuates pejorative realism to the point where the characters in this movie might want to think twice about whether or not they should look in the mirror!!

137,Geofbob,"Superb technique, pity about the clichees",7,3 May 2001,"For anyone who still hasn't seen this movie, and worries about such things, the following contains a couple of SPOILERS marked towards the end.The overall message of Traffic is one that needs to be made - that it is fallacious to regard efforts to control drug use as a ""war"" being fought by ""us"" against ""them"", when the ""enemy"" includes our children and fellow citizens. However, the movie deliberately leaves open the question of what action should be taken. Technically, Traffic is brilliant, especially the skillful way Steven Soderbergh weaves together the  different stories. The production values, camerawork and editing are all first class. As well as indicating when the action moves from one sub-plot to another, the colour washes for some portions of the movie are a visual reminder of the mind-bending effect of the drugs that the film is all about.  Most of the performances are credible or better, with the possible exception of Catherine Zeta-Jones who is ill-suited to a role that is itself the most unrealistic in the movie. Michael Douglas is very effective in a straightforward part, that requires him to act his age, and be magisterial for once - quite a contrast with Grady Tripp of Wonder Boys. Oscar-winner Benicio del Toro stands out as a Mexican cop trying to do the right thing, as does Erika Christensen, as Douglas's druggy daughter.However, all those merits admitted, I found some aspects of  the movie rather tired and clicheed. Unfortunately, this includes much of the way the Mexican side of the story is handled.  American film-makers seemingly find it impossible to regard their non-English speaking neighbour with an objective eye, and can see only poverty, ignorance, corruption, brutality, degradation and sweaty heat - all features not unknown north of the border.
(SPOILERS) Other hackneyed episodes in the movie are not one, but two, pairs of buddy-buddy cops, one of each pair being killed; the old chestnut of the vital witness under police guard, in the usual seedy hotel room, who is nevertheless found and ""offed"" by the mob; a lot of the US street action concerning drugs; and the black judge in the court case (a constant stereotype in American movies and TV, though most  movie/TV counsellors are white). Nevertheless, this is a film to see, probably more than once, to appreciate its cinematic qualities, and simply for the story.",Traffic
138,senortuffy,"Hardhitting, honest film about drugs.",10,14 July 2003,"This is a really superb piece of film making.  It's hard to find any fault with it - the acting, the editing, the story are all riveting.  Nearly two and a half hours long, but you won't move from your seat.This is a film about drugs, on each side of the border with Mexico.  There are several plots interwoven with each other, but altogether, the viewer gets a good sense of what drug trafficking is doing to people.Michael Douglas plays a newly appointed drug czar in Washington who discovers that his teenage daughter has a bad drug habit.  Benicio Del Toro is a Tijuana policeman who's recruited by one of the drug cartels. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the wife of a major American importer of drugs who gets busted.  Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are a couple of DEA agents tracking the dealers.The movie is shot in a semi-documentary style, with much of the movie done on videotape.  The acting, especially Benicio Del Toro, is great. 
There are no heroes per se, except for Del Toro's character, who turns his new bosses in to the DEA in exchange for a baseball field for Tijuana's kids.  You follow the trail of the drug trade and watch the casualties mount up, and in the end the traffickers are still in business and nothing much has changed except for the players.  Kinda like real life.This movie is Steven Soderbergh's finest work and he was very deserving of the Oscar he won as best director.  Benecio Del Toro won for best supporting actor also.A perfect 10 in my eyes.",Traffic

There are no fierce gun battles, hot fights, passionate music and bed scenes that American movies are good at. He is more similar to the record. Textbook case of multi-line narrative. The model of the use of filters, the yellow dim Mexico, the blue cold drug world, Soderbergh directly opened the three main lines with the lens. Around the center of drugs, the three main characters pull out three main clues. These three clues are not separated by a unit, but they are pulled around each other and go hand in hand, and finally woven into a ""drug network."".",Traffic
140,cofemug,Worst movie about drugs,2,18 March 2001,"I saw this in January, and again, recently.  The movie sucks.  It sucks, Sucks, SUCKS.  This is a bad, unoriginal movie that Soderburgh even rips off his own styles for.  I hated this movie and can't understand what people see in this movie.  The plots on their own were highly unoriginal.  We have drugs corrupting a mafia-like Mexican law, we have the rise of the next head of a drug crime syndicate, and the story of parents dealing with their kids doing drugs.  Could be, without a big stretch of the imagination called Goodfellas, The Godfather, Requiem for a Dream/Sunday night movie.That's the most base of qualms for this turd that stunk up the theaters. Another is the style.  It took the style of Magnolia or Short Cuts.  But, it insulted my intelligence with the color schemes.  The color schemes do not mean anything deep, it was just a way of separating the stories.  Now that's insulting.  I can watch Short Cuts and keep those stories straight, give me some credit.Another stylistic fault is the color schemes themselves.  When changing around they started kind of cool, but got irritating.  I had seen the bluishness in Out of Sight and the brown in the other nominated (and much better) Erin Brockovich.  Both directed by Soderburgh.  In both movies they worked because they fit the theme of their scene.  In this, they just got boring.And, finally, the camera work.  It was another case of over-stylized camera work whelming the movie.  Do we really need the slo-mo/fantastical/sped-up camera work?  It was highly unnecessary and boring.  I do wish that style had a point when it was used.  Like in Requiem for a Dream it had a point. IN The Doom Generation it had a point.  In this movie, it didn't.The only thing good about the movie, I must concede, is the acting. Unless you survive off acting, it can't save a movie from the doldrums.  Skip this movie, and go watch something redeeming instead.2/10",Traffic
141,DanB-4,Should Have Won Best Picture,10,29 August 2002,"Best Director and Screenplay, but not picture? Oh well, Soderberg's stunning win as Best Director for this amazing film locks its place in history. Gladiator may have taken the big prize, but this was the best film of 2000.This is a long a complex film that you need to see more than once - the kind that is worth owning on DVD and watching again and again. It has no real plot, but just tells interweaving stories that show, as the director has said, that the war on drugs is a constant losing battle that acts as a price support system for the cocaine and heroine trade. There are three parallel stories about characters who never meet, but who are all affected by the drug trade. Benecio del Toro is brilliant as a Mexican cop who is a straight as he can be and as crooked as he needs to be, trying to bring down a drug cartel. Michael Douglas plays a judge recently appointed to the federal commission on drugs, who is unaware that his own daughter is a junkie. Catherine Zeta Jones has the performance of a lifetime as a country club wife who comes to realize that her husband is not the pillar of society she thought he was.None of these people meet, but their lives are controlled by the same evil, but in different ways. What needs to be observed in this film is how these characters all draw the essentially same conclusions via different avenues.This movie is a directorial triumph. Soderberg threads these plots in and out of eachother without making the movie messy or confusing. A lesser director would have had some giant conflict or shoot out scene where everyone meets at the end so we can see all the big stars at the same time. But ""Traffic"" is more concerned on showing how widespread the cancer of the drug trade is, that the same narrow avenue can completely consume so many people without them ever knowing who eachother are.Migeul Ferrer, Luis Guzman (miss him on ""Oz""), Don Cheadle, Erika Christensen and Benjamin Bratt all play key supporting roles with ease.There is no Hollywood ending here - but a film that ends with a sense of futility and frustration.

I also liked the way they portrayed the ins and outs of the drug trade.  It shows that their are no real winners in the war on drugs.  The cast was exceptional even though the story was bleak.

However, in giving this commentary, I may give away things which may be considered spoilers. All I can say is if I had read my comments, it would not have spoiled anything for me.Following four different perspectives on the drug issue, this movie provides much hardship, little reward and hardly any finality. It's as if the movie dropped in, filmed the participants for a while, and dropped out. Good. The drug issue isn't something that can be packaged. I got an impression of helplessness and futility. The hands of drugs are far reaching and without barriers. What especially got to me was the perspective of the drug agents in the USA. Basically trying to clean a beach of its sand with tweezers, they go on doing their job. I found it really powerful and sad. What I really enjoyed, however, was that it wasn't being crammed down my throat. This movie doesn't tell you anything, it allows you to make conclusions. I was totally captivated during the entire movie and took it home with me to think about. In the end, that's what this type of movie should do, and that's what it did for me. 9/10 I also recommend seeing ""The Insider(1999)"" if you liked this movie.

The film does not tell the story of Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), an Mexican police struggling to keep its distance from the corruption that seems to follow him everywhere; is not the story of Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) and Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle), two DEA agents trying to transform the drug dealer low Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) against drug cartel chief; is not the story of Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the wife of the innocent cartel drug boss who suddenly discovers that her husband really is, and what he does for a living; is not the story of a new head of the DEA, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a man so involved in his mission end the war on drugs, he fails to realize that his own daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is becoming addicted to crack. It's not only one main story, it is all these stories that construct the film in a fantastic way, showing the traffic world from various perspectives. And much like in the real world, the events of each story, directly or indirectly affect each other.In terms of history, ""Traffic"" is absolutely brilliant, Stephen Gaghan (screenplay) uses a writing so incredible, delivering over 100 scenes of dialog between the characters and their stories. They all serve even as an anti-drug message, and the direction Soderbergh helps complement everything.The film is so well directed that the public feels suffocated. There is no background music at all, leaving the viewer feeling as if witnessing scenes of real life, not just watching a movie. These techniques to make a very personal experience for that Soderbergh, as in previous films, uses various shades of color specific to enhance a mood or a feeling of awareness of what is about to happen in each story of a character.The film's cast is totally flawless. There is no better or worse in the film, each and every character adds something significant to the history of film, and each actor is excellent. But three actors, in particular, stand out: Benicio Del Toro simply superb gives a performance so realistic and PERFECT to his character; Don Cheadle fantastic as always; Catherine Zeta Jones delivers a performance so complex and gets better with every passing minute.A stunning movie, ""Traffic"" has a steady gaze hard on called ""war on drugs"", which is perfectly clear and uncompromising. Director Steven Soderbergh and writer Stephen Gaghan stand up the various points of view of the drug culture, ranging from users, traffickers, police and politicians. And weaves his characters and their different stories into one story that is deep in his ideas, but very simple to understand with pure realism that the film manages to show. In terms of history, direction and characters, ""Traffic"" is easily the best Soderbergh film to date, and one of the best films made in recent years.",Traffic

A Mesmerising Achievement",7,13 December 2006,"Drug trafficking has become a major, worldwide problem; it's causing havoc across the globe and brings crime in many forms. You hear about drug-related problems on the TV, the newspaper, the radio and the general media as a whole. It has become a media sensation, governments are supposedly trying their best to stop it and police forces are supposedly tackling the problem down to the core. A lot of people see the ""drug epidemic"" as something that is communicated through small triangles coming via low-life street gangs corrupted by poverty. Now when tackling a problem like drug trafficking to the core a word such as ""corruption"" is a central key to the problem. Traffic proves just how big the drugs ring is and that it is a triangle that is constantly moving.Traffic is a study of social dilemmas that are faced in the recent war on drug trafficking. The film puts forth so many details of how everyone is affected by the problem. Traffic, unlike other drug films like Trainspotting or Requiem For A Dream that focus on the soul affects of humans Traffic's heart is set on showing the involvement on everything. It's a wonderful anti-drug film that shows the tackling and breeding of the problem. The film's gritty nature is needed to create the fast-paced style, the fade in/fade out editing is usually perfectly and does not detract the viewer from the story. Everything is crafted with elegance; the story manages to work around the script with an astonishing amount of pressure.Traffic personifies film-making and with what is easily some of the finest direction from the 21st century it will remain a highly reminiscent work of film. Stephen Soderbergh is a director who I've personally never been a fan of, but Traffic stands out as a tour de force example of highly challenging cinema. The direction grips you; it captures the persevering and dirty nature needed for the film. The excellent editing and screen-transitions show tremendous skill at the art of film-making. The use of colours to distinguish the different stories works as a brilliant metaphor. The wonderful soundtrack accompanies scenes with a polished style, each song or piece of music is chosen to fit each scene flawlessly.The cast is one of the best casts to ever come out of cinema in recent years. With the likes of Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta Jones, Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle and Dennis Quaid you may expect the film to feel very ""mainstream Hollywood"". Yet it doesn't and each actor manages to pull off their performances with the needed emotional power. Benicio Del Toro gives the best performance of his career (along with the latter 21 Grams) managing to create a believable character who reacts to a situation with the needed realistic response. He becomes his character throughout the film's two and a half hours running time, which never fails to lose its grip nor fall into pacing/structure problems. The other shining performance is that of Catherine Zeta Jones who gives a highly poignant performance reminiscing one of Oscar material. Overall it's Benicio Del Toro who steals the show, deserving his Oscar with what is a genuinely effortless example of brilliance.Traffic gives the viewer morals through conflict; it's a film that should be taught in schools as it shows the ultimate effects of what drugs do to our society. It puts fourth many questions of ethics, values and responsibilities in a controlled and sophisticated manner. The substantial amount of dialogue that the film relies on manages to remain an absorbing cinematic device helping to understand the character's current situations and pasts. It's sharp and digs down to the point, seeing as that's what is needed the film succeeds in another area of greatness.One of the greatest films of the decade so far, a film not to be missed and one that forges a mile-stone in direction.",Traffic

151,jckruize,The 'War on Drugs' is unwinnable.,9,31 May 2004,"Steven Soderburgh demonstrates his mastery of the film medium with this sprawling, multi-character and plotline expose of American law enforcement's mammoth, endless campaign against illegal drugs. Three distinct story arcs and numerous characters are expertly woven into a compelling narrative that scores its points without attempting to wrap everything up into a neat package. The real world is messy and often ambiguous, and this film does a good job of reflecting it.Screenwriter Stephen Gaghan has said that his research revealed one common denominator among those on the front lines of this 'war' and that is despair. Supplies can be interdicted with the proper application of force (and funding), but the underlying problem of a society's demand for mood-altering substances is rarely acknowledged and even more rarely addressed adequately. There may be those out there who can make the case that we're winning this war but clearly these filmmakers would beg to differ.Benicio del Toro won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of a conflicted Mexican policeman, but many others in the cast are equally impressive. Highest compliments go to Erika Christensen as the high school over-achiever who's also an addict; Michael Douglas as her father, a judge appointed to the position of federal drug czar who gets a hard lesson in the way drug abuse can insinuate itself into any stratum of society; and Don Cheadle as an undercover cop whose efforts -- and those of his comrades -- all too often lead to naught. In the latter section, Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a good, non-hysterical portrait of a trophy wife who learns more about greed and ruthlessness, and herself, than she could have imagined.Soderburgh's cinematography (he operates his own camera) differentiates the three intertwining story lines with stylistic precision: yellow/overexposed hand-held camera-work in Mexico (del Toro and the Federales' assault on the Tijuana cartel); predominantly blue tones/dark interiors in Ohio and Washington, DC (the judge and his daughter); and warm sunny tones in San Diego and La Jolla (Cheadle and his team's bust of Miguel Ferrer and their stakeout of kingpin Steven Bauer's estate). It's not just a gimmick; it works. This is an adult film. It entertains but makes you think, without preaching. Soderburgh, Gaghan, et al know there are no easy answers.",Traffic
152,shaid,"Good,very good indeed.",9,17 April 2001,"""May contain spoiler""I like Steven Soderbergh. When I watch a film from him I feel I am treated with respect. I never once has the feeling that someone think I am stupid. This film is no exception. An intelligent directing to complicated script that always assume that I, as the viewer, can follow more than one story in one time. The script follows 3 stories which run simultaneously. The first one tells the story of a judge, Robert Hudson Wakefield (Michael Douglas), who is appointed as the new head of the D.I.A. while his daughter is on her way to drug hell. The second story revolve around a Mexican policeman, Benicio Del Toro, who tries to run his life through conflicting situations. The third story is about a Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who has to deal with her husband arrest and find herself taking over his business. Soderbergh jumps from story to story and use different colors to establish which story we are watching(no use of titles to let us know that we are now in Mexico or in the USA). The fact that some characters from one story appear in another one, show us that everything is related and connected to everything, and also keep our attention to the screen.I find the film to be very good and though it lasted 2 1/2 hours it passed very quick. I don't think its the best Steven Soderbergh has ever done (Erin Brockovich & Out of Sight were much better), but nevertheless its better than most movie which come from big studio's in Hollywood, and when his next film comes out, I'll go and see it because to my view Soderbergh is one of the most original and interesting director in today's movie world.",Traffic
153,darkjosh,Slow Moving Traffic,7,19 January 2001,"Traffic is an ambitious, lengthy, and often dull film that examines the effects of drug smuggling and use in the lives of three people, two involved in diminishing its availability and another unaware her livelihood comes from illegal drug trade.Call Traffic a mixture of last year's poignant, masterful emotional Magnolia and The Insider's slow but utterly effective character study. However, take away the smooth story and cinematography transitions from character to character in Magnolia and Insider's thoughtful, meaningful moments of slow movement and solitude and you get Traffic.  Not to say Traffic is a bad film - it never gets preachy or goes the way of Oliver Stone and turns into a loud diatribe.  What it is missing, however, is a charge of electricity that never truly gets the thrills going.What Traffic lacks in solid storytelling it makes up for in a heap of fantastic performances, most notably Benicio Del Toro's turn as Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, caught between serving his personal belief on the drug war.  Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman also serve up two witty characters, and Miguel Ferrer's best role since 1987's Robocop as a dealer turned witness who believes the drug war is futile.That's the main message of Traffic, and again, thankfully, we are not beaten over the head with it: the war on drugs is futile and the best prevention of drug addiction comes from the support of family and friends, not from a billion dollar government project to stop drugs from entering the country and taking down drug cartels.Despite its loose, meandering, and sometimes unsuccessful interweaving storylines, Soderbergh still manages to illicit some great performances from his cast.

Where do they come from, where do they go  ... and how are real lives affected?   If you really want to know, this cesspool spills skillfully onto the screen in several intertwined tales that riveted my attention for 160 short minutes.  Two governments (US and Mexico), a drug lord and an American Family offer storylines that intersect and leave you with more reality than you could possibly hope for.The belly of the beast (a drug shipment interception) is where you start. You slide deeply down into the bowels of the cartels and their oily circles of influence.  Separating the good from the bad and the ugly is a daunting task for the viewer.  Little is as it seems to be.  Nice is ruthless; ruthless can be nice.  It's a business.  Move the powder.  All of it makes this film believable.Though only an expert could confirm, logic and the senatorial cameos tell me this work accurately microscopes into the drug world's inner workings.  It's laundry day for the cartel machinery, hanging it out on the line for viewers to inspect.  It delivers an entertaining education into a reality affecting 22% of the U.S. population: an eye opener for those of us (me!) who live with our heads in the sand vis a vis this reality.The cast is spectacular.

Summing: Casting's Debra Zane, `. . .ya done good.'30 years ago, in the French Connection, 'Popeye' Doyle (Gene Hackman) asks an addict, `Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?'   Traffic gives you the HOW TO version while defining his catch phrase question once and for all. The picture itself is a course in the ways of the addict; but the film is so well-crafted on the consequences side of the balance, it's a course from which wise people will veer clear.A second viewing will be necessary for me to collect all the gems this movie has to offer.

158,WilsonLau,Mediocre at best,1,10 June 2001,"This movie further sustains the fact that no matter what role Douglas plays(with the exception of Falling Down), Douglas acts exactly the same. Its just like the same person with a different name and occupation. His facial expressions for every situation is the same, his actions and reaction for every role, every emotion, every situation that his character faces in every movie is the same. He is Steven Seagull without a pony-tail.The movie is incredibly over-rated. The direction of Steven Soderberg is grossly over-rated. This movie's plot is too simple, too weak, predictable and too straight forward. There are minor plot curves but like I said they are minor and also few and far between. A general conception of this movie after I watched it and looked at the big picture was to put in as simple a way as possible,(which is fitting for such a simple movie) is that is was ""JUST PLAIN BORING"". Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas does nothing in this movie. You could of put anybody in that role. The only good out of this movie was the superior acting of Don Cheadle. He is the only person in this lack-luster cast that shines. Which makes me sick to think that it was nominated for a best-movie Oscar. Much worse is the fact that it won best director.4.5 out of 10- very very ordinary",Traffic
159,RussianPantyHog,"OK, but one enormous flaw",5,23 February 2005,"The story of a conservative judge appointed to head US drug policy, intertwined with sub-plots involving his own daughter's drug-taking and the criminals actually producing narcotics at the other end, with a sub-plot of an initially innocent woman gradually taking over her husband's drug business. Most people seem to think this film is great. The reason I don't is because I've just seen the European version of Traffic, a TV movie made a year earlier, and it is SO much better. It's impossible not to make comparisons. Michael Douglas is excellent as always in the lead character and so was Peter Reigert (wasted in a small role) but that's about it. If only Catherine Zeta-Jones' talent could match her ambition. Her Welsh/South American accent is laughable. The worst aspect of this film is the superficial ""Disneyesque"" way it deals with Douglas' daughter's drug-taking. It's a joke. We don't see anything ""nasty"" and at the end she simply comes back to Daddy and gives up drugs. The Euro version really does show the filth and the squalor and the utter despair of a junkie as the young Oxford student drops out and descends into a life of thievery and prostitution to feed her habit. SO much more convincing. I'm annoyed by this movie because it was made later than the European version and had a much higher budget so it should have been better, and it simply isn't.",Traffic
160,Manthorpe,The self-perpetuating War on Drugs.,10,8 July 2004,"Finally a film has been made that displays the War on Drugs for what it is, a completely futile failure. How many people's lives must be taken by the drug lords and gangsters that profit from recreational drugs being illegal, and therefore extremely profitable, before we realize as a people that something else must be done? Not to mention treating drug offenders with compassion rather than condemnation?Some may completely disagree with my stance, but the way I see it, it's an impossible idea that it can be won in the ways in which we have already tried. Get rid of the profit, get rid of the crime and criminals. This would mean all recreational drugs would have to become legal, and in turn purified and protected by our government like normal prescription drugs. It'd be harder for young people to get them that way, they'd be safer, and there wouldn't be people killing each other over them because the market would be gone. Likely? Probably not, but it's because I don't think we're mature enough as a people for this idea to come to fruition yet. And in the end, what business is it of yours what I decide to put into my body as long as it doesn't hurt another human being on this planet? None of your f-ing business! End of f-ing story.As for the film, complete mastery in all departments. The cinematography is simply beautiful and entirely fitting. The scenes in Mexico have a gritty feel to them and are dominated by orange and yellow hues, which is further complimented by the gritty, shaky feel of the camera. The political and family scenes, in which Michael Douglas appears in, have a much more subdued and soft feel to them and are dominated by blue hues. This is meant to display opposite spectrums of the war, the war that both fronts are fighting in futility, just in different ways.  I think this is also portrayed in the drug dealer scenes, featuring Catherine Zeta-Jones, and her drug lord husband. These scenes are displayed in regular color resembling the real `traffic' of the film. At least that's my opinion.The cast is second to none and I especially enjoyed Benicio Del Toro here, as he's entirely convincing as the torn Mexican policeman. He more than deserved his Oscar. The acting and ensemble cast is, overall, nothing short of perfect. But the direction, screenplay, and editing are what really make the movie unique and interesting besides it's amazing message and undoubtedly deserved the three Academy Awards it received in those departments. Soderbergh really catches the eye here and will no doubt be a force to be reckoned with in his future films. Many directors have recently tried splitting up scene presentation to keep the audience entertained and many have failed. This is certainly not one of those films.
Excellent and extremely entertaining cinema about a very important issue in today's society, and with a powerful message to boot. Very highly recommended.",Traffic

It involves three different stories that are in some way connected that tells how lives are effected by the drug war. This movie doesn't tell you what to think, it lets you make up your mind, but it clearly shows how the drug war, at least the way we are fighting it now, is failing. This movie comes from the line of other great films like Magnolia, and one of the best films of the 90s, Pulp Fiction, in becoming a movie that involves different stories that are interconnected and works surprisingly well. My only complaint is that it's somewhat confusing. It's a movie you need to see more than once. I give Traffic a 9 out of 10.",Traffic

This is the conclusion it took us millions of dollars to articulate.  If you want to waste the next two and a half hours of your life seeing how we did this, please stay in your seat._Traffic_ is just inexcusable, especially when you consider the fine talent that went into it.  I don't even know where to begin... I suppose we should just go point by point.1) Screenplay: I heard an interview in which Michael Douglas said that this film was meant to present three closely interwoven stories.  I suppose ""closely interwoven stories"" is supposed to mean ""unrelated and random episodes concerning similar themes.""  The entire film was completely disjointed and made only minor attempts to connect its three major plotlines.  The number of characters in the film is beyond unwieldy, as evidenced by the thin dialogue and number of lines we hear from each actor. Quaid, who gets near-top billing, probably has about 20 lines throughout the film.2) Style: Every story in this film looks different.  Now, I'm just a college student with some background in film, but I'm not sure that this promotes cohesion.  It smacks of a bad Kubrick imitation.3) Overwhelming and oppressive agenda: the political anti-conservativism of this film is just overwhelming.  If any other group had been portrayed this badly in a film, there would be a major poop-storm over it.  Honestly, though, the teens-doing-drugs-under-the-noses-of-their-conservative-parents scenes were so over the top that I actually found myself wondering if the film was trying to be funny.Ugh...if this film wins Oscars over _Quills_ and _O Brother Where Art Thou_ I will be be seriously disappointed.",Traffic

The eerie musical backdrop is a little over-used throughout but it gives you time to reflect as the plot gathers momentum and develops quickly. Revelations come and can be brief in detail - you need to piece things together for yourself. It's not all laid out for you. The cast is excellent and the 4 interwoven stories are cleverly told with subtly and nuance highlighting vast competing issues.

This movie deserves a big-screen projection or at least a widescreen version; unfortunately, my video store had the VHS only in pan-and-scan.  I had looked forward to seeing it for more than six months! From my recent impressions, I strongly (Rating of 10!) recommend this as one of the very few superb films released last year.  It has, however, something to offend everyone's sensibilities.  It kept me watching till the final credit to see whether Director Steven Soderbergh thanked the Clinton White House for location shooting (actually the shots are at ""The West Wing"" mock-up stage).  The U.S. Senators come across as a bit sycophantic, in my opinion.  The teen characters are quite unappealing even as they are superficially ""beautiful"" and ""cool."" It offended me with what looked like authentic drug paraphenalia and smuggling material but the source material, I'm fairly sure, included all of the simulated usage for its shock value.  The ending is certainly positive and I hope the situation it depicts along the Mexican-U.S. borders has been sufficiently ""rubbed in the noses"" of the policy makers and elected officials nearby. I'm not quite sure how I'd answer briefly what it finally says about the ongoing Federal War on Drugs -- is it a Civil War waged primarily upon ""family members"" (fathers ""fight"" daughters as in the film) or a Vietnam War with entrenched soldiers who are ""grunts"" versus die-hard propagandists (an African-American ""foot-soldier"" versus the ""traitor"" informant who is being witness-protected to no avail, for example)?

It was like we had this excellent film and they spliced in sections of a Turner Television Movie of the Week. I can't take seriously the image of a Judge and a senior government official wandering through the poorest section of town asking drug dealers where his daughter is.

172,MadReviewer,The Real Best Film of 2000,9,16 July 2001,"A dazzlingly complex film, `Traffic' takes a hard, unflinching look at the so-called `war on drugs' that is perfectly clear and uncompromising. Director Steven Soderbergh takes the various viewpoints of the drug culture -- the users, the dealers, the police, and the politicians -- and weaves their differing stories together into a single story that is both deep in its ideas but very simple to understand.  In terms of story, direction, and characters, `Traffic' is easily Soderbergh's best film to date, and one of the best films made in recent years, period.`Traffic' takes a look at the world of drugs through the stories and lives of different characters.  Some are loosely connected to one another; some are not.  There is the story of Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), a Mexican policeman struggling to keep his distance from the corruption that seems to follow him everywhere; there is the story of Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) and Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle), two DEA agents trying to turn the low-level drug dealer Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) against his drug cartel boss; there's the story of Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the unsuspecting wife of the drug cartel boss who suddenly learns who her husband really is and what he does for a living; and then there's the new head of the DEA, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a man so wrapped up in his mission to stop the war on drug, he fails to notice that his own daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is becoming addicted to crack.  Much like in the real world, the events of each story directly or indirectly affect the events of the others, leaving all the characters to consider their roles in the drug culture . . . and what, if anything, they can do to change those roles.In terms of story, `Traffic' is absolutely brilliant.  I'm still amazed that the film could cover so many plotlines and dozens of characters so effortlessly.  Each story -- whether it's Helena assuming the role of her drug-dealing husband, or Robert canceling DEA meetings so he can deal with his drug-addicted daughter -- is powerful and brutally honest.  `Traffic' isn't afraid to look at tough or uncomfortable issues.  `Traffic', somewhat surprisingly, never preaches, either -- while it's safe to say that the message of the film is essentially anti-drug, it never comes out and outright says that message.  A lesser film would've had some grandiose speech imbedded somewhere in the film denouncing the use of drugs -- not `Traffic'.  It's wise enough to let the viewer take what messages they want from the film, without ever preaching.  (A minor quibble -- did Michael Douglas' character really have to be the new drug czar of the United States? The fact that he was the top law enforcement drug official in the U.S., and that his daughter was addicted to drug . . . well, it seemed a little too far-fetched, and a little too movie-like.  If Mr. Douglas had been playing ONE of the top drug officials in the federal government, instead of THE top official, I would've found his character to be infinitely more believable.)Soderbergh's also at the top of his game with his direction of `Traffic'. The film is virtually filmed entirely with hand-held camera, giving each and every scene an up-close-and-personal feel.  There's also a distinct lack of background music, which lets the viewer feel like they're eavesdropping on real-life scenes, and not just watching a movie.  These techniques make for a very personal, intense experience.  Soderbergh also uses a technique he's used in some of his other films (Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich) -- certain scenes are filtered a specific color, to heighten a mood or a sense of awareness of what's about to happen.  The scenes in Mexico featuring the Mexican detective Javier, for example, are all filmed in a very bright, almost disorienting yellow.  It's a technique that can be irritating at times, but for the most part, it serves a bold purpose that truly adds to the film.As for the characters, and the acting . . . jeez, `Traffic' is without a doubt one of the best-cast films of all time.  I mean it.  There are no weak links, no poorly written characters, and no badly played characters.  Each and every character adds something significant to the story in `Traffic', and each and every actor is outstanding.  Kudos must go to possibly one of the best ensemble casts of all time.  Three actors in particular stand out, though -- Benicio Del Toro (who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance), Don Cheadle (who was actually slightly better than the brilliant performance of Mr. Del Toro, IMHO), and Catherine Zeta-Jones. I'm normally loathe to use the word `flawless' when describing a film, but the casting of `Traffic' was indeed flawless.`Traffic', with its unflinching look at drug use in America today, can be uncomfortable at times to watch.  It certainly can't be termed a `happy' or a `feel-good' film.  That doesn't change the fact that it is an amazing, thought-provoking, powerful film -- and without a doubt the best film released in the year 2000.  I can't recommend this film enough.

It was kind of like PULP FICTION except no dancing at Jack Rabbit Slims.The first story is about a cop in Tijuana, Mexico named Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and his partner (Jacob Vargas) who go undercover as drug dealers and learn about the horrors that occur in the drug business.The second story is about a pair of police officers (Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman) who are protecting a powerful man named Eduordo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) who is to testify in court against a powerful drug lord named Carl. Carl is being held in prison while his nervous wife Helena (Cathrine Zeta-Jones) begins to take over his business by dealing drugs.The third story is about America's new drug czar named Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas). He is trying his hardest to keep the youth of America away from the biggest drug dealers and drugs that rule our country. But, a crisis in his family is occuring. His 16 year old daughter Caroline (Erika Christiansen) has fallen in with the wrong crowd in school and has now become a drug addict.

174,kira02bit,Lower your expectations for this overrated mediocrity,3,17 December 2002,"Lower your expectations for this overrated mediocrity.  Nothing irks me more than critically overpraised films and few fall so squarely within those parameters as Traffic.  Based on a vastly superior British miniseries, this U.S. adaptation unfolds like a Readers Digest condensed overview of the drug trade.  It hops, skips and jumps between several stories, none of which are given enough screen time to truly engross the viewer in what happens.  For all of the kudos heaped on the film, it breaks no new ground and its assertion that the war against drugs is pretty much a hopeless battle has been explored more effectively in far better films.  The cast, with a few exceptions, is solid.  Michael Douglas does quite well as the U.S. drug czar trying to educate himself on the drug war, while his own daughter (Erika Christensen) is selling herself to finance her next high.  Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman make the most of underwritten roles, while Dennis Quaid is totally wasted as a conniving attorney.  Benicio del Toro brings a nice weary note to his character of an embattled Mexican police officer, but he really did not deserve an Oscar nomination (much less the Oscar) for this performance, especially in such a great year for supporting actors. Catherine Zeta-Jones is light years beyond ludicrous in a completely incomprehensible role that seems to go from one extreme to the other in the blink of an eye.  Hers is by far the weakest acting in the film.  As far as Best Director Steven Soderbergh, his only contribution seems to be that he films all the events in Mexico in a headache-inducing yellow tint, all of the events in Washington D.C. and Ohio in a washed out blue/gray and all the events in California in normal hues (no wonder why this was so big with Hollywood).

Steven Soderbergh started his career by directing the highly recommended independent movie ""Sex, lies and videotape""- which I unfortunately didn´t watch until today. But I loved ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Out of sight""- movies that walk on the thin line between art and commerce. The last one is one my alltime favorites! Only a fool would call them star vehicles.

Scary thing about this is, Soderbergh's best work may be yet to come.This crime drama is his finest work to date. In 1998, critics were heaping praise on ""Out of Sight,"" but it was virtually ignored by the Academy. The Academy was wise enough to know that awarding him for that film would be premature. It's like they were telling him you have promise, keep going, make us proud.'  Off he went, making ""The Limey"" and ""Erin Brockovich."" The latter seemed to be the ticket. Big-time actress in a solid human drama gives performance of a lifetime. The director finally connects with an audience, for the first time since ""sex, lies, and videotape."" Is ""Brockovich"" the film Soderbergh went to the mountain and came back with? Heck no. It's not THAT good.Then, nine months later, comes ""Traffic."" Shot almost exclusively in handheld, it feels a lot like a documentary. the central character is Robert Wakefield, the President's appointee to be the new Drug Czar. Michael Douglas is having a great year as well. First with ""Wonder Boys"" and now this. Seems like he's being very choosy about his roles. Apparently, though, he wasn't Soderbergh's first choice. Douglas stepped in when Harrison Ford passed on it (Ford must have a screw loose). We're so used to Douglas giving these great performances, this one hasn't raised one eyebrow, at least not with critics. Who listens to these people anyway?Wakefield's story focuses on his transition into his new office, his confirmation jeopardized by his teenage daughter, who's become a drug addict. It sounds corny on paper, but just watch the film. There is real power in this storyline. The best performance in the film is given by Erika Christensen, who plays Caroline, Wakefield's daughter. As with Douglas, critics have ignored her while heaping praise on the film and its director. Maybe the Academy will see it differently.Many different stories are told, intersecting each other now and again over the film's 2 hours and 20 minutes. Every character is connected with the other in some way. All of it has to do with the flow of illegal drugs across the Mexican border into the United States. If we're to believe the film, the War on drugs is unwinnable. The War is about containment, not outright victory. This is fiction, but there are facts the back up this story, scary facts. One example: The cartels spend more money on their intelligence than all of the U.S. government agencies battling drug trafficking combined. Another: from a business perspective, drug trafficking may be the most successful industry in the U.S., maybe the world.The film visits the War on all fronts. Wakefield's battle is waged with the cartels themselves, but also within his own family. While he's spending time away from home, taking meetings with agency officials and visiting the U.S./Mexico border and Mexico City, preaching the merits of winning the War on the demand side and not the supply side, he's losing touch with his daughter. His empty sermon: If the kids stop wanting the drugs, seeking them out, then the War is over.The reality is that the drugs will keep on coming and the government will never stop fighting. The cycle will continue forever and ever. Knowing the government cannot win, the cartels claim victory. They're laughing at us. If anything, `Traffic' is a call for the DEA, the FBI, Customs, to get serious. Mere containment is not enough.The entire subject of the drug war has been forgotten lately. It's still raging as intensely as ever but it's become an unpopular subject, like nuclear weapons. think of `Traffic' as a public service, its intention to renew interest in a vital issue. It's an excellent composite of the War's effect on our country. Probably the best ever made.If Soderbergh doesn't walk away with Best Picture for this, I'll be very surprised.

180,LaurieMann,Extremely Well-Made Movie,8,15 March 2001,"It's a very good movie, but it does tend to leave you with the impression that drugs are an issue for Mexicans, for people in the DEA, for very rich people and very poor people. I suspect the middle class is involved in there somewhere!Soderbergh has directed a very ambitious movie and has, for the most part, succeeded admirably (and to release the very entertaining Erin Brockovich in the same year was quite a feat). My main complaint about the directing was the selection of an odd ""lighting/texture"" of the film, particularly in the Mexican sequences.  It made the film hard to watch.  But the performances and pacing were both terrific.I'd never noticed Benicio Del Toro in a film before, and he really fills the screen in this film.  He looks like a larger, Hispanic Brad Pitt with a much broader acting range.  That he's nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor (he dominates well over half the movie) is a shame. OTOH, it means he probably will win the Oscar, since it does look like Russell Crowe's year for Best Actor.On the other hand, that Michael Douglas was completely blown off of any major award nominations in a year when he gave two of his best performances ever (for Wonder Boys and Traffic) is also a shame!Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman have terrific chemistry as DEA agents working in drug-enriched San Diego.Catherne Zeta-Jones gives a very good performance as a confused, arrested drug-lord's wife who gradually becomes less confused.Even Benjamin Bratt, in one short but pivitol scene, is spot-on.This year has been a disappointing year for films.  Traffic (and Erin Brockovich!) makes it less so!",Traffic
181,EThompsonUMD,One of the half dozen best American films of the last decade.,10,23 June 2001,"[Very slight spoilers] Director and cinematographer Steven Soderbergh creates in Traffic an Altmanesque narrative mosaic of epic scale and complexity. In developing its unflinching examination of the contemporary drug scene, the film takes us on a sweeping journey across a social landscape that ranges from the political drawing rooms of D.C. drug policy-makers, to the posh houses of California drug lords, to the meanest street abodes of pushers and users, and to both sides of the Mexican-American border - the putative `frontline' in the hapless, perhaps even hopeless, war on drugs.Masterfully inter-cutting among three plot lines, Soderbergh also interweaves three symbolically-suggestive cinematographic styles: a grainy, handheld, sub-titled documentary style for the Mexican scenes, a cool Conformist-like blue for many of the drug use scenes, and a `realistic' color palette for the middle-America scenes. Perhaps the film's greatest glory, though, is its extraordinary wealth of fascinating characters  some are admirable, many are despicable or pathetic, but all are developed with incredible economy of dialogue and screen-time. Much of this success, of course, must be attributed to the casting. Michael Douglas gives an understated, highly nuanced performance as Robert Hudson Wakefield, a U.S. drug czar whose failure as an administrator opens the door for his redemption as a human being. Erika Christensen, as Wakefield's troubled, drug-addicted 16 year old, is continuously surprising and convincing.
Among the Mexican characters should be mentioned not only Bernicio Del Toro's much-deserved Academy Award winning turn as a corrupt cop with an idealistic heart, but also Tomas Milian's chillingly wonderful (and under-praised) performance as Mexican General Arturo Salazar. Catherine Zeta-Jones, pregnantly (literally and figuratively) playing a drug lord's pregnant wife, is a revelation, dominating the screen in every scene she appears in. Other fine performances are turned in by Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman, as DEA officers, Miguel Ferrer, as a middle-manager in the drug-pushing business, and Topher Grace, as a glib high school pusher. All in all, Traffic's use of a high quality acting ensemble to choreograph and humanize the drug plot and the film's social and political themes also bears comparison with the socially-conscious Altman of Nashville and Short Cuts.
Having rooted heavily for Traffic to win this year's Best Picture Award, I was pleased when a viewing of its recent DVD release only reinforced my original reaction that this was far and away the most artistically ambitious and powerful film in the Academy-nominated field, the beauty and intrigue of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon notwithstanding. I'd now go further and claim it as certainly one of the half dozen best American films of the last decade.",Traffic

Ensemble work good--heroics distributed among a number of guys who play it very cool. Real politicians for texture.  And a conclusion that gives you something to take out of the theatre.

I'm about three-quarters done and have taken three breaks. The movie is so boring and depressing I keep having to turn it off.  This time I may not turn it back on.  It doesn't seem to make it as a drama, as a suspense film, or as a documentary.  Here are some of my problems:  Can anyone who has sat on the bench and is appointed Drug Czar be so naive about drugs?  Does no one in the Hudson home have a sense of smell?  Can the major drug distributor in LA be penniless? And can his wife be totally ignorant of his real job?  Did Gen. Salazar study dramatics under Hannibal Lechter? Where is Anthony Quinn when we need him!?!  I've decided; I'm not going to watch the rest of it.

184,tommyg,Audio Memories,10,2 February 2001,"I left the subterranean parking structure yesterday (February 1, 2001) after viewing TRAFFIC with two audio memories. The first was a comment heard in the screening --one row behind me -- by a man making a comment to his wife.  This moment was fifteen minutes into the movie when he said, ""This is a good movie!""I knew this as fact five minutes before his comment.  TRAFFIC is not a usual type movie by any means but one in which I found my own heart racing in anticipation of another experience in the politics and power of drug movement between Mexico (Tijuana) and the US.  I felt as if I were personally living every Los Angeles Times article that I ever read that deals with scandal and corruption within local and national policing departments.The second audio memory was two hours later, when I emerged from the subterranean parking at Century City (Los Angeles).  My radio was muted by a weak or non-existent signal on its preset digital to a local NPR (National Public Radio) station as I drove around and up the structure to exit.  At the moment that sunshine slapped my windshield at street level, the radio was clearly tuned into an NPR commentator mentioning Mexico's frustration with police corruption in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico with specific reference to Mexican President Vicente Fox's declaration of a ""war without mercy"" against drug trafficking.  We all know the latter as fact five years before this movie.  But, somehow, TRAFFIC cuts though the politics of politics and denial, and provides an easy path to a clearer vision of the drug addiction problem in the United States and a solution that goes beyond police effort against the local seller or user.The supply-and-demand curve must be attacked with aggression, but not from a supply side perspective.",Traffic

His direction of Traffic is lifeless. It is amazing how much ""Traffic"" seems bored with itself.        The performances in Traffic run the range from excellent (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to bad (Benicio Del Toro). I wonder why Soderbergh told Del Toro to say his lines so slowly. No human speaks as slowly as Del Toro does in this movie. His performance has to be one of the worst ever to win as Oscar. I don't understand how both critics and audiences saw his performance to be good. The scene in the pool is absolutely the........ worst........... in..............the ........moo.......vie.        The best part of ""Traffic"" is Catherine Zeta-Jones' story line. That part contains the best acting, writing and direction. Michael Douglas also gives one of his finest performances in this movie, though that story line is incredibly boring except for Douglas. Rent ""Requiem for a Dream"" if you want to know how someone can be demeaned by addiction to drugs. ""Traffic doesn't go far enough"".      ""Traffic"" was a wildly uneven movie, clearly not one of the best of 2000. ""Erin Brockovich"" had uniformly good acting and the direction was always lively and innovative. ""Erin"" was the better movie.",Traffic
187,Jose E,One of the best movies of 2000,10,16 June 2001,"Traffic is one of those movies I have enjoyed more the second time. Aside from being so well made and acted I think I like it most because doesn't portray Mexican people as evil and US as good. It was time a movie dealing with the delicate matter of drugs put everybody in the right place. There's good and bad on both sides of the border.I'm so touched by the colour contrast in the movie - the parts taking place in Mexico have a sort of mild orange, while the ones from the US are in a normal color. The beginning and the end are particularly impressive.
The cast is superb, mainly Benicio del Toro, Dennis Quaid, Don Cheadle and Michael Douglas. Even the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones shines here, as the disappointed wife of a big drug dealer from San Diego. When her hubby is busted she feels a sort of rejection towards him, but eventually she is willing to fight tooth and nail for him, even if that means traveling to Mexico to take her husband's role as chief of the drugs traffic in San Diego.Judge Hudson is very busy fighting drugs all over the country and beyond that doesn't know he's got the enemy at home. Her daughter is hooked on heroin and when he finds out he is so appalled. Later she starts getting laid in a sloppy flat to afford her spending on the white powder and he goes crazy, chasing her through all the city.The whole film is so realistic, and the (deserved) success it has achieved surprises even more, given Hollywood's known love of harmless stuff. Fortunately movies like Traffic help keeping some faith in that something believable can be done over there now and then. To me, movies that make people look at their navels and think ""We are the best, and we are perfect"" are plain expendable. It's great that Traffic doesn't fill that slot.Ten out of ten.",Traffic

190,Nocgirl72,One of the most AMAZING movies EVER-the second time around.,10,4 September 2001,"I saw this film at the theater after hearing alot of good things about it. I had a hard time at first following the characters and who was who, who was good and bad, who was a cop and a trafficker, etc..It took me watching the movie the second time to know completely who was who and after you get that figured out, this film is amazing, so well made and realistic. I was not a big fan of Benecio Del Toro at the time but while watching the film, something about him stood out and I think he is awesome. There are several different storylines and although some of the characters share no scenes together, they all are in it together for one reason-DRUGS.
There are 2 main heavy drug cartels in this movie. The Juarez cartel amd the Tijuana cartel. When both sides are happy nobody gets killed, as long as they make their money. When things are bad, people die.Benecio Del Toro earned this well deserved Oscar as a slightly crooked but anti-drug cop who is tired of seeing his country torn apart by drug traffickers. His partner in crime is his buddy Manolo who is also has some tricks of his sleeve.  They are working for a local corrupt police force when the opportunity arises for them to work for a bigger entity.
Michael Douglas plays a judge who is just appointed to being the drug czar for the US. He has a 16 year old daughter who is an addict.
Catherine Zeta Jones plays a pregnant housewife whos husband is  arrested and being charged with drug trafficking. Don Cheadle plays an undercover cop. Him and his partner bust one of the largest dealers in the country-Eduardo Ruiz and they try to get him to snitch on his superiors.The movie is intense. I couldnt keep my eyes off of the screen although like I said, the first time it was a little hard to follow. The second time cleared up almost all of what I was confused on the first time. The hardest part is just figuring out who all the people are, but for some people who are good at following slightly confusing movies, they won't have a problem following it. The ending is awesome.

Everything does come together and does make sense later.  This one shows the complexity and the difficulty of the drug war and it also brings a personal touch.  The tragedy of nearly losing (or losing) a daughter/son to the drug war.  I also have to admit, this is one of the few films that shows how the system can turn an innocent spouse into a vicious criminal.This one is a great film about the reality of the drug war and its affects. It also shows the flaws of the system in both prosecution and the criminals it can create.Over all, definitely worth your while (8 out of 10).",Traffic
192,MyDarkStar,I had high expectations - it lived up to them all !,8,5 December 2001,"Because of some bad luck, I never got a chance to see this in the theater. So I had to settle for renting this. Thus, I already had heard the hype of ""Traffic"". Already had seen Benicio Del Toro get his Oscar. Already had heard how it was ""the real Best Movie of 2000"" etc. etc.So, when it came time to watch this movie I had VERY high expectations.
""Traffic"" did not disappoint !This is the best movie I have ever seen on the ""Drug War""....I would even go so far as to say that there will probably never be another movie that depicts the Drug War as thoroughly. That is because this movie covers EVERY SINGLE STAGE of the Drug War from foreign drug lords, to foreign police, to Southern California distributors, to street dealers, to users, to the American undercover detectives, to the head of the DEA. You just can't get more extensive than that !This movie does a brilliant job of putting all the pieces together in the drug puzzle. The idea of using the head of the DEA's daughter as a child drug-addict is a perfect way to segue between users and government. It is the only way that this extensive story could have fit into a single film.The direction is also brilliant. The most amazing part of the direction is the fact that it was done by Steven Soderbergh, who directed ""Erin Brokovich"" the same year !!! That is one busy individual ! He completely deserved to get the Best Director award. He really adds interesting elements to certain scenes, which help capture the moment : In Mexico he uses a orange/gold lens filter that exemplifies the dry feeling of the desert. In the assassination scene he uses quick, short shots to show the panic of the moment. The scenes depicting the teenagers freebasing cocaine (and later shooting heroin) are downright eery.The script is great as well. So much so, that you want to listen to the bad guys talk, because they make really great points when they do.I give it a 9/10.",Traffic
193,advaitkamat,Stylishly mounted and masterfully executed.,10,20 August 2013,"It took me multiple viewings of Steven Soderbergh's magnum opus ""Traffic"" to fully appreciate its zeal. And with each viewing I learned something from it, something that was slyly hidden beneath the skill Soderbergh so wonderfully inculcated in it. There's no doubt that few filmmakers know the craft better than him. I mean, look at ""Sex, Lies And Videotape"". Does it seem like someone's directorial debut? Nope. And yet Soderbergh managed to assemble a movie that was nothing less than a lesson in screen writing and film-craft. ""Traffic"" is no less. The plot follows intertwined stories of the people involved in drugs through four perspectives : Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), a Mexican police officer, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), a conservative Ohio judge and drug czar, Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle), who runs an undercover DEA operation with his partner Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) and Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the pregnant wife of an arrested drug lord Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer), who is trying to keep her husband out of prison. Javier Rodriguez wants to keep his nose clean even though the corruption is escalating around him. Wakefield, who plays the prime role in the war against drugs, finds out that his own daughter is a druggie. Gordon, who had arrested Ayala and is out to nail him for good, tries to protect a whistle-blower after his partner is killed. And Helena wants to get rid of the debts that her husband has piled up and try to keep him out of any trouble. The story-lines entwine to give one plot wherein every character tries to, in some way, wreck the drug business.In the movies that I've watched, there has rarely been a compelling portrait of America's war against drugs. And here's the ferocious ""Traffic"" with its ambitions too heavy for its own shoulders trying to pull off what many have - and failed - before it. To tell you the truth, I hadn't anticipated the prodigious power that ""Traffic"" withheld. But the marvelous script from Stephen Gaghan and Soderbergh's assured direction made it an interesting mishmash of a striking narrative and visual treat that chronicled the events smoothly. I especially noted the hand-held camera technique that Soderbergh employed on several occasions, giving it a documentary-like aura and believably recreating the right mood. Yet another notable film technique that stood out was the effective use of lighting for each of the sub-plots. A grainy, tinted look and feel is given to each separate story and that's requisite if the makers want us to invest into 135 speaking parts and a story that spans over 7 cities. That's cheeky but beneficial, real beneficial. Though I savored ""Traffic"" in every which way, I found the Wakefield storyline to be the best among them all. Yes, it did contain an intimate account of the effects of drug addiction but I found it to be more engaging precisely because it felt real. And yes, it also contained one of Michael Douglas' very best performances. It's one story that you could easily relate to, you see, because it had characters that surround you everyday, doesn't matter where you're from or where you live. That was the one sub-plot that got closest to being a documentary.Benicio Del Toro, who won a deserving Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work on this film, is a live-wire with his powerhouse performance. He feels astonishingly real and his performance as Rodriguez ranks a point higher than the one as Che Guevara in ""Che"", another Soderbergh picture made in 2008. Douglas should've nicked an Oscar nod too but sadly did not. However, he is excellent as Wakefield, chiefly in one of his final scenes where he has to deliver a speech in front of a live press and instead has a minor breakdown. Cheadle and Zeta-Jones are likewise very convincing in their respective roles.Though many may not agree with me on this but I find Steven Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" to be his best work yet and certainly his most ingenuous. Vastly undervalued, it ranks among my favorite movies of the '00s because it takes a difficult story and works wonders with it. ""Traffic"" is not so much about drugs as it is about its characters. If you want a different cinematic experience, an enthralling cinematic experience, then I'd recommend it to you. Brilliant. I find no other word to describe it any better.",Traffic
194,silviopellerani,"Rude, crude but realistic",6,25 August 2001,"Have seen many films about ""narcotraficantes"" and drug addicts but I must say that this one directed by Steven Soderbergh goes deeper than anyone else.The uncontrolled Mexican border with power and political interests is well represented by the local policemen which are looking for information about the ""Narcos"". Michael Douglas is a judge with special power for the drug fighting in USA. His position is rather political and less operative. Has a beautiful family with a daughter who is a drug-addict. All the shots in Mexico are in a sort of black and yellow colors which give a dusty and unsecure atmosphere. There are some passages of the film really well achieved like the one when the judge has a press conference and decides to modify it according to his personal and familiar problems.Far better than ""Scarface"" is a psychological not too violent film about this rotten world.Rating: 6/10",Traffic
195,charlietuna,Platoon yet done with style,6,19 February 2001,"Steven Soderbergh is to be commended for his ambitious effort in Traffic. With very few break downs, Soderbergh managed to advocate the viewpoint that the ""War on Drugs"" is stale and futile without being overly pretentious. Yet ""Traffic"" is a far more ambitious project than either of his earlier successes, the ""Underneath"" or the ""Limey"".  Multiple narratives, combined with the big budget seduction of the obligatory shootouts and explosions added a bit of weight to the 147 minute running time that could have been better spent on character development.  The audience is asked to be quite forgiving as Michael Douglas throws off the cares of his high level government appointment to become a flat foot in search of his daughter, and the seemingly victimized Catherine Zeta-Jones is transformed into a savvy, ruthless drug lord.  Be that as it may, Soderbergh handles the complexities of the decades old ""War on Drugs"" more deftly.  Without standing on the alter of treatment over punitive deterrence measures, the screen play does a credible job of illustrating the myriad of motivations for everyone from the user to the dealer.  While those of us with a more intimate knowledge of American drug policy over the last two decades may quibble that Soderbergh stopped just short telling the whole the truth, ""Traffic"" represents the most comprehensive overview of the problem presented to the viewing public other than the real life trail of Manuel Noriega.  As we all know, that event didn't exactly make it to Hollywood, much less the Academy. 
From a cinematic viewpoint, some purists have had trouble with Soderbergh's use of filters and Stephen Mirrione's editing of the Mexico sequences. While clearly used as a punctuation for the differing challenges the drug culture presents north and south of the border, the script was effective in illustrating them without the added visual hyperbole.  However, the same could have been said about Coppola's heavy use of filters in ""Apocalypse Now"" and Stone's overbearing utilization of religious symbolism in ""Platoon"".  Fortunately for Soderbergh, his effort in ""Traffic"" comes closer to Coppola. All in all, this is a solid crime drama that in addition to entertaining the audience, may provide the ancillary benefit of perspective on a political question that is far from resolved.Benicio Del Toro shines above all in the film and from his work this year in ""Way of the Gun"" and ""Snatch"" appears to be on his way to establishing himself as one of the better actors on the scene today.  On a side note, it was pleasing to see Steven Bauer cast as a state side drug kingpin while Jacob Vargas's character took on the moniker of Bauer in De Palma's ""Scarface"".

196,mal karma,One Of The Best Of The Decade,10,26 September 2002,"'Traffic' is about the eternal war between the drug dealers and those people in the governments that are trying to 'erradicate' them. Even though there has never been a true advance in that field, which is actually growing.
The acting is great even for Catherine Zeta Jones, who always seemed to be reading her lines from a board somewhere. The environmental lighting is great and gives more depth to the scenes, and remarks the social, economical and cultural differences between the countries. This is also a movie about loyalty, morality and principles. And not to mention devotion and maintaining an objective look of the situation, no matter what is going on around you.This is a film that can't be missing in any good modern top 10 or 20.

197,Strider_1978,"An excellent, uncompromising, honest portrayal.",10,3 March 2008,"Best director, best adapted screenplay, best actor, best film editing.It is quite obvious how this picture got its acclaim.More often than not, the narcotics industry is glamorised, or portrayed with stylish gangsters. More often, the actors are being theatrical, or the violence is brutal, even in a given context. More often than not, the thread is quite simple, and involves lots of people getting shot, or mutilated, or meeting a grisly demise.Not very often it is, that a picture can convey the effects of the drugs world on all social tiers of society, which such uncompromising honesty.Traffic, with an all star cast that are so incredibly natural that it is quite easy to see the characters and not the actors themselves, has four running story threads, that occupy the same world and era in time: The upper class politicians family, the drug lords wife and her child- entwined with the two cops that are striving to make a case against him. And the honest, hard working Mexican cop, trying to do the best that he can in a dangerous world that he believes is worth fighting for and preserving.It would go as far as to say that Traffic is not a film you watch for thrills. It is not a jazzy crime thriller, nor is it full of explosions and fireworks and car chases. What it is, is beautifully shot, incredibly well acted, and driven with maverick skill.The messages- there are many. One, as mentioned above stands out more poignantly than the rest. Narcotics affect us all. They affect our families, are streets, our neighborhoods, our parks, they affect 'us'. Sodenberg shows us, with a documentarians eye glass, how things are beneath the sugar coated iceberg. After the beaches and the duck course luncheons and the Georgetown mansions there is a world that many of us would like to shy away from. To close our doors and smile sycophantically and pretend does not exist. Only to shut our doors, is to perhaps to confine ourselves to the real war, at home.Indeed what fools we all are, going to law school, undertaking a hard days work with our lunch buckets, teaching a classroom full of rebel children. Why, we could be out there, earning multiples of our paychecks by running and pushing an industry that far exceeds any government resource levels.I strongly recommend this picture to anyone seeking an honest, emotional, yet also artistic ride.

198,ravenus,Awesome thriller cum human docu-drama,10,5 October 2004,"The film as most of you will already know deals with the drug-trafficking phenomenon prevalent in the US. The narrative is told in the form of 3 interspersed stories set in the US and Mexico: a high-level DEA official (Michael Douglas, who's actually good in this movie!) whose efforts to curb the traffic are contrasted with his own daughter's addiction problems, the wife of a gang boss (Catherine Zeta-Jones, thankfully not stripping) who struggles to gain control of her life in the aftermath of her husband's arrest (and ends up doing more than that) and a Mexican cop (Benicio del Toro, good debut) who is trapped in a suffocating haze of corruption around him. Each of these stories appears to have been shot in a subtly different style, the Mexican portion standing out because of its docu-style photography (kudos to Soderbergh for this), downplayed acting and stark lighting schemes. The screenplay moves at a good pace and considering that at least 2 of the stories, the DEA agent's and the Mexican cop's, had the potential to be individual movies in themselves, always comes across as pithy and gripping. Soderbergh thankfully presents his material in a very matter-of-fact fashion thereby avoiding the pitfalls of a more melodramatic approach, especially with reference to the portions that relate the addiction escapades of the DEA man's daughter. This is miles ahead of Sex, Lies & Videotape and, I expect, Erin Bronkovich (which I refuse to see, it being a Julia Roberts star vehicle). Technically the film is quite sharp and in this case not just garnishing over an empty dish. I also mention the music (Cliff Martinez) which offloads the burden of orchestral scores to take a more synth-based sound which, although not riveting in itself, adds a lot to the film's atmosphere.

(The first 6 minutes is entirely in Spanish, without subtitles. The only words I recognized were the dirty ones.)The premise (as stated on the IMDB page for the film) seems like a good one, but this is so arrogantly made, ignoring the audience, that it seems designed only to appeal to equally arrogant critics (who scorn anything that's actually popular).In summation: Ghastly, unless you're one of the latte and croissant crowd who calls movies ""cinema.""",Traffic

201,movie_dude719,Brilliant,10,25 January 2001,"Movies like Traffic are few and far between. A movie that grabs your attention and forces you to watch it. This isn't a movie to see in a case where you are looking for laughs. For laughs, go down the hall to Miss Congeniality. Anyway, it is a drama that is gripping, intelligent, and smart. It is based on the British mini-series Traffik written by Simon Moore. Stephen Gaghan writes the screenplay for Traffic and it won him a Golden Globe. 	The plot is a little complicated. There are about three different stories going on at the same time. One of the plots involves a Mexican police officer, Del Toro. He is working against a Tijuana drug cartel. These sections are in Spanish and that adds to the authenticity of the movie. The next plot involves Michael Douglas. His character is a speaker against drugs. But the irony of it all is his daughter, Christensen, is a cocaine addict. She will do anything, and I mean anything for drugs.	The next one is about Catherine Zeta-Jones' husband who has been arrested for drugs. Two cops, Cheadle and Guzmán, think she might be involved, so they follow her around. The movie isn't as complicated as it sounds. You can tell what story is taking place by the color tone. The Del Toro scenes are orange-ish. The Douglas scenes have a blue tint, and Zeta-Jones' is regular.	The drama and suspense build as the movie progresses. The performances are great. Del Toro won the Golden Globe for best supporting actor, a well-deserved win. There is every sign of a great drama: Good plot structure, good performances, and, most importantly, it is interesting. The movie shows all the bad things about drugs. It leaves in all of the ugliness of them. Because, in life, there is nothing pretty about drugs.",Traffic

203,andy-933-696608,Traffic Movie review,10,8 January 2011,"The war on drugs has proved to be a difficult battle. ""Traffic"" itself has given us viewers a clear and speculative glimpse of how much is truly lost in this war, who the enemy is, and who truly suffers in the end. Director Steven Soderbergh divides this well made close look into the world of drug trafficking, separating its plot into 3 individual stories, showing the multiple aspects of the war on drugs. The main factors he tries to educate viewers on are the concepts of addiction, widespread corruption, and even the desperation shown by several characters. It all begins with a simple drug bust, turning into a variety of open opportunities for Mexican police officer named Javier Rodriguez (Del Torro), in the eyes of a questionable Military general, using what he's seen to further eliminate more drug cartels, including the real life Tijuana Cartel. You'd think that all the efforts General Salazar is making to eliminate these cartels is noble and cunning, only to work more for his advantage, as well as for those he truly works for, the Juarez Cartel. The film shifts back to the U.S. where Judge Robert Wakefield (Douglas), hits the big time in Washington, earning the title of a Drug Czar, hoping to reduce the flow of drug trafficking, and the consumption of illegal substances. In the eyes of a politician it will be challenging, and even inspiring. But how will it see to the person they truly are at home, when the very enemy they are fighting comes in the form of a loved one? Wakefield's daughter's addiction to multiple lethal drugs bring her father into a new viewed aspect on how challenging the war on drugs really is, entailing the true horrors of waging war on someone who means the world to you. In San Diego, 2 undercover DEA cops, Gordon (Cheadle) and Castro (Ruiz) bust a big time drug dealer, who willingly makes a deal to sell out the big man of his operation, as well as the father of his second child to come from his spoiled and soon to be corruptible wife Helena Ayala (Zeta-Jones). As Carlos Ayala, is dragged out of his home, and placed on trial, Helena's desperation to protect her son, and maintain the wealthy lifestyle she's been accustomed to drive her to the tainted art of her husbands unforgivable business of illegal distribution. All it took was some debt, some threats from their rival groups, and a little push from her husbands lawyer Arnie (Quiad). All these stories put these characters into corners where their moral compasses direct them to make final decisions that influence not only each other, but the general outcome of America's stance on the war on Drugs. Javier faces the difficult decision of whether or not he should side with Salazar as well the very drug distributing devils who make life in Mexico hell, or if he should reveal all that he knows to the DEA, in the exchange that they make a change for the children in his neighborhood. Robert realizes the depth of how vicious a battle they are facing against drugs, seeing the desperate acts of his daughter's addiction to obtain more drugs. Helena folded and decided to stain her soul with the choice of her husbands business and all its requirements, including the will to murder, lie, and further push for the distribution of drugs in America, with more advanced knowledge. As we've seen the war on drugs in America is a war where winning seems impossible, particularly in the methods the politicians, and state and local agencies hoped for. It's not clear if we will win this war, however our efforts proved not in vain, as the actions of few show that many out there have the possibilities to make a difference to win this long battle. Roberts actions to listen and support his daughter are noble enough to prove that despite facing an unwant able enemy, our hope is not lost. Javier's need to help those in need, and throw away his desires to help those without fortune show the desire to change, what the influence drugs and their cartels have created for innocent and easily corruptible people. I especially enjoyed the conclusion to Helena's story, how Gordon in a premeditated act, slips a transmitter well enough to show, that the enemies will at some point face the true hands of Justice. ""Traffic"" is more than just a look into the very process of transporting drugs across the border and there. It's also a glimpse of the battle of those for and against drugs, how this conflict affects our country and the people in it. This battle is still going on today, right now, and despite the odds of percentages against us, through our determination to not only cut down the distribution, but help those tainted by drugs is comforting enough for Director Soderbergh to send the message that we can win this war.",Traffic

Not long enough.  Feels like the ""greatest hits"" from a longer drama- which, not having seen the British miniseries on which it is based, I suspect it might be.  Rarely do I feel that a film would be improved more by adding than removing footage, but ""Traffic"" would be.Many characters' motivations are unexplained, or just inexplicable. Complications of drugs and the 'war' on them are raised, then abandoned. Name actors pop up, then disappear.  Another 30 minutes or so could have helped add some definition to ""Traffic""'s skeleton of ideas.  Or, better yet, make a two-hour movie revolving around Mr. Del Toro's character.  The other two stories aren't nearly as compelling, at least not as they're told here.Mr. Soderbergh's direction of the actors is assured, even delightful (I'd love to see those Cheadle/Guzman outtakes!).   But his photography, while gorgeous, it's also obvious in its nature.  I felt I was being nudged every time the movie changed locales:  oh, we're in Mexico; ok, we're back in D.C. This, and frequent shortcuts taken by the script, underestimate the patience and intelligence of the audience.  I am glad to see such a mainstream, politically-oriented, open-minded movie produced; certainly the conversation it has engendered is welcome, and we need more films like it in these respects.

209,fiozinho,"The chaos of the drug trade, brilliantly evoked.",8,26 March 2001,"This is a brilliant evocation of the tangled web that is the drug trade, set in Mexico/USA but universal in its relevance. Soderbergh has taken various strands of society that affect or are affected by the flow of drugs onto the market place and made them all, at times harrowingly, human. Each strand, each element, is so vividly brought to life that it's impossible not to get involved with every character, and there are many, that moves across the screen. Of these, Javier (Benicio del Toro) is by far the most sympathetic, and it's a tribute to this actor's talent (never has an Oscar been better deserved) that the internal torture of the underpaid Mexican drugs officer is always crystal clear yet never overstated. He is the brightest star of a film that only loses points in its determination (mistaken, I felt) to leave no end loose, so that the tying up of the situations of the main characters comes across as mainstream Hollywood, when the feel had been refreshingly independent throughout. But that's maybe to gripe - it's a gripping film by an outrageously talented director. A must-see.",Traffic
210,matt caccamo,4 stars,7,7 January 2001,"`No one gets away clean' reads the tagline for Steven Soderbergh's new film `Traffic.'  This is the most accurate way to summarize an engaging and disturbing film that blows holes into the `war on drugs' we see on television.  In this film, Soderbergh takes on a contemporary subject with courage, showing the reality of American's drug problem as in issue that touches all. Following disparate stories taking place simultaneously in Tijuana, San Diego, Cincinnati, and Washington D.C., `Traffic' illuminates what our leaders try to hide from us everyday.  The war on drugs isn't a practical, traditional war that can be won through force; instead, it is one that thrives on force and turns that force around to kill the supposed good guy. The multi-layered storyline of this film portrays drugs in America as an issue all should be concerned with, not just politicians, police, and dealers.  By using separate stories spread across states, cities, and suburbs, Soderbergh sheds light on the food chain of drugs in this country. The producers, middle-men, dealers, buyers, and law enforcers are all caught up in a battle where the goal is blurred and the ending nowhere in sight. 	 The vital character to this story is Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), an Ohio State Supreme Court judge who has been chosen as the new federal drug czar when the film opens.  While his official role links him directly to the war on drugs, it is his personal dilemma, as the father of a drug-addicted teenage daughter, that makes his story complete.  He is, in effect, a symbol of the two-sided drug problem in America.  He sees both the small picture and the big picture: his daughter is an addict in need of help and discipline; his country and government are addicted to a solution that solves nothing. 	Soderbergh enhances Douglas's role with a wonderful ensemble cast. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the wife of a drug importer who ruthlessly frees her husband from a trial that would have certainly put him away.  Benicio Del Toro, in the film's best performance, plays a bilingual police officer from Baja California caught between a two-timing Mexican drug official and the lure of helping American D.E.A. agents in San Diego.  Also adding strong roles are Dennis Quaid, Don Cheadle, and Luis Guzman.  Soderbergh effectively moves between cities and strong, important characters without ever confusing or cheating the audience. 	In the end, this film works so well because Soderbergh avoids moralizing; he leaves the judgement to the audience.  Some may walk away from this film thinking our war on drugs is a terrible failure; others, like conservative Utah Senator Orrin Hatch (who plays a quick cameo), may believe this to be an anti-drug movie which illuminates how hard, and necessary, our current form of fighting drugs is. 	At one point in this film, Douglas' character has an awakening to his job and his government's role in fighting drugs.  After seeing his daughter fall victim to drug addiction and his plan to destroy a cartel in Mexico fall victim to corruption, the drug czar sees that the `war on drugs' has become a war on each other and, in his case, a war on his family.  Soderbergh shows us that the `war on drugs' isn't simply a war on drugs; it's a war on everything and everyone associated with drugs, from a Mexican policeman to a teenage addict to a dealer's wife.  And no one gets away clean.",Traffic
211,magicsinglez,knowing all about drugs and feeling superior in our knowledge: is the method they use to keep us off them,4,23 July 2006,"A bunch of people lie to and kill each other. Everyone in the movie is either corrupt or incompetent, with the exception of a Mexican police official/crime lord and a black American DEA agent. The crime boss is a good-guy because, no matter the body count, he has a playground built for kids. The drug agent is a good-guy because, he keeps plugging along trying to get drugs off his streets. Oh, and it's a good idea not to get your girlfriend high in the hopes of having fun, because, not only will a bunch of people lie to and kill each other, your girlfriend may end up the property of a drug dealer/pimp. It's an interesting menagerie.It may all sound pleasant (if yer some kind of masochist I suppose). Regardless, I didn't find the movie pleasant. Traffic was lacking some in the humor and drama department. Actually, even with humor and drama, I usually don't find these crime shows pleasant. There was only one scene I found pleasant. The humor I found in this scene is probably due to the fact Drug Czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) reacted to the scene in the movie almost exactly the same way I was reacting in my seat.This is a movie for people who feel the need to know about the illegal drug industry. I'm sure there was a huge audience for this movie in that this (knowing all about drugs and feeling superior in our knowledge) is the method educators and entertainers use to try and keep us off drugs, in our 'tolerant' world.

We've all seen similar plots in similar films before, but rarely are the performances this believable, the direction this excellent, or the stories this gripping.  I loved the changes in cinematography used to contrast the different settings, the highly original camera angles and the clever interweaving of the separate plot lines.  I know there are some who think that Zeta-Jones lets the film down, but there is not one dud performance in my opinion. Every cast member shows a strong window into their character's plight.  Whilst Del Toro was very good, I did feel that all the acclaim and awards that he received from this role made his performance a little overrated.  He was wonderful to watch, but my expectations of him were very high due to the hype surrounding the film.  In retrospect, I think I understand what was so impressive. It was great to see Cheadle and Guzmán paired together against a very under-used Miguel Ferrer, as well as Quaid and Douglas in meaty roles.  Very refreshing use of interwoven plot lines since the swarm of movies using them post-Pulp Fiction.  I've noticed a few comparisons to Magnolia because of this, but that is the only similarity.  You get more closure in this movie and it hits the point quickly and clearly.  In all, Traffic is an excellent film worthy of all acclaim it had received.  It deserved to win the Best Picture Oscar, considering it won in all its other nominated categories (but we all know that Gladiator had the Hollywood Epic sign stamped all over the voters).

217,Alex-Tsander,Diluted version of the British original.,7,29 March 2005,"Two stylistic features of this movie are immediately striking. The documentary style and the use of monochrome colour cast, being a sepia for the Mexican scenes and anti-Tungsten for the U.S parts. In summary, these things sound gimmicky but in practice they work extremely well.Whilst the plot line of the original German / British TV version remains essentially intact the axis of UK / Germany / Pakistan has been transposed to U.S / Mexico. In and of itself this has the effect of distancing the separate elements from each other. The Douglas character lives in a completely different world to the druggies and the Mexicans might as well be on another planet. Whereas, in the original, the English equivalent character lives in London, where communities of politicians, druggies and Asians from the sub-continent all live cheek-by-jowl. This creates a kind of friction and dissonance between the different elements which is entirely lacking from this version. Perhaps it is to compensate for this that the director works in scenes where the different characters pass by each other oblivious, in their travels. Which, in fact, seems extremely contrived and gimmicky indeed.On a related point, the plight of the daughter seems somewhat softer than that of her counterpart in the earlier version. If for no other reason than that she is an American living in a huge house rolling in money with which to fix her habit. Whereas the British equivalent character endures her fate amidst irredeemable grittiness under the grey-skies of claustrophobic England.Another weakening of the story centres upon the cartel-wife played by C.T.Jones. In the original, she is a German married to a Pakistani and when she is forced into her husbands ""business"" she ends up continuing to run the operation after his release, giving him the orders. Whereas, in this version Jones' character seems to retire back into the role of housewife almost as soon as Her Man is home.Connected to this is the failure to truly clarify the way in which she is sucked into the drug business and the moral choices that ""law enforcement"" cause her to face, forcing her to choose the ""wrong"" side. Similarly, Toro's detective starts with a cynical attitude towards Salazar but after snitching on him say's that he feels like a traitor. But we are not shown any intervening explanation for such an emergent sense of loyalty to Salazar, who is perhaps the nastiest character in the story.I personally found all the ways in which alcohol issues are worked into the story as a rhetorical way of raising the question of whether drink is a drug to be extremely heavy-handed. again, it may be that there is more of an inhibited attitude towards alcohol in the U.S which makes the comparison between cocaine and Scotch more credible. The argument is spurious and detracts from the main theme of the story, being the futility of the ""War on Drugs"". Nonetheless, in spite of these failings, the movie is an engrossing and suspenseful tale. The sub-text remains provocative in spite of having maybe been diluted for the U.S. market and the visual style makes it very watchable indeed.( Viewed 26.3.05. Previous version commented upon recollection of viewing several years previously ).",Traffic
218,Kevin_Maness,"A movie that very badly WANTS to be ""important""",7,6 January 2001,"If you believe the TV ads and trailers for Traffic, then you'll think it wants to be an Academy Award-winning political action thriller.  When you go see it, you'll also realize that it desperately wants to be a so-called ""important"" film.  It's not.  Traffic succeeds only in being a moderately entertaining action flick that will not hold up to the scrutiny to which you subject it during the 10-minute car ride home.Actually, what Traffic does is prove that, even with a great subject (the complexity of the North American drug trade and the futility of the US war on drugs) and plenty of recognizable actors, a movie still can't be good without convincing characters and fresh, well-written dialogue.Traffic actually does quite well in showing America's drug problem to be mind-numbingly complex.  In one scene, Douglas's new American drug czar asks a planeload of policy experts to give him some new ideas on how to stop the flow of illegal narcotics from Mexico into the US.  The only suggestion he receives is a request for more funding and less restricted training of enforcement agents.  Otherwise, the plane is a silent as the movie's audience, no one having any idea how the problem might be solved.  If the Mexican supply problem is knotty, the demand issue in the States is just as complicated.  With high street values, ready availability, and millions of underoccupied, overpaid white suburbanites willing to pay for the goods, there's no way that anybody is going to ""just say no"" to buying or selling drugs in America anytime soon.  Traffic makes the war on drugs seem quixotic, tragic, and ultimately ineffectual, and that, I think is a worthwhile statement to make in a movie.Unfortunately, Traffic makes its statements not with creative filmmaking, but with shameless news talk show moments in which stock characters recite stock speeches designed to explicate the weighty issues without needing to bother with character development or well-crafted screen-writing.  The movie occasionally pauses for a minute or two while various characters--the drug czar himself, a beleaguered convict-turned-star-witness, an uppity private high school student--step up on their soap boxes to deliver show-stalling diatribes on drugs in North America.  There's nothing wrong with the politics of Traffic, in my opinion, but don't mistake engaging political discourse for good movie-making.So the dialogue is bothersome, but so are the characters who speak it. Traffic presents us a host of characters who are at times engaging but who all too often slip into movie-cliche and stereotypes.  There's the high-principled drug czar slightly nauseated by the grasping, hypocritical officials he rubs shoulders with during his Washington workdays.  There's his teenage daughter who is ironically abusing drugs recreationally while her father does off fighting the war against those same drugs.  There's the marital strife when her drug habit is exposed and dad wants to punish (to send a message) while mom wants to forgive (hasn't she suffered enough already?).  We watch the speedy decent of the daughter from weekend abuse to prostitution in a matter of screen minutes (and real life days).  It all feels so familiar, which doesn't jibe with the ""important"" aspirations of the movie.  And when Catherine Z-J's character goes from a pregnant wife of a US drug lord who's ""never been on my own--there's always been someone"" to a sadistic, pregnant lionness who can order mob hits, stare down the Mexican drug king, and produce dolls make of cocaine, I know I'm seeing the kind of movie magic that can only make sense in Hollywood.  Simply stated, the movie would be much more legitimately ""important"" if it could offer believable characters who look like the people I've known rather than the people I've seen in other ""important"" movies.There's a place for this kind of screenwriting on prime time news shows like 20/20, 60 Minutes, and Nightline.  We'll hear speeches like the ones in Traffic on Academy Award night, too, but they will come from the mouths of the privileged, ribbon-wearing presenters and recipients, and (hopefully) not from the nominated films.",Traffic
219,greenforest56,"great picture, wrong message",10,1 October 2005,"Artistically, this is a great picture, well worth seeing. Forget the content or the message, for now, let's just look at the picture.First, using a sepia tone for all the Mexican scenes. This was great, giving a perfect emotional tone to the moral and physical poverty that is Mexico. It was also an easy but clever way to let us know when we passed from one side of the border to the other.The shot of the helicopter landing in Mexico City  what a great shot!!! That right there is a tour-de-force of the imagination. To make something mundane like a helicopter landing and turn it into something artistic is a small triumph, and this picture is full of such small triumphs.Shooting the picture in a semi-documentary style at times lent a powerful immediacy to many scenes.Note something you won't note while watching the film: the score. Why won't you note it? Because it is almost non-existent. Since silent pictures movie makers have used the power of music to emotionally manipulate audiences. We have heard these emotional musical cues so often we now respond to them automatically like Pavlov's dogs.But in this picture the score is almost non-existent, yet the picture is still powerfully gripping. This let's you know just how great the acting, directing, editing, casting, scripting, is. Everything that needs to go right in a film went right in this one.Now, to the message content. Many say this picture is not preachy. I must disagree. The message is nihilism. That the whole war on drugs is pointless, so why fight it? The only smart thing to do is to sell drugs, after all, the drug dealers are winning anyway. That's the message.I must disagree. If selling drugs was just a slap on the wrist misdemeanor, a little public service time, I wouldn't be writing this right now, I'd be selling drugs  and trying to get you hooked so I'd have another steady customer. .......And you'd be doing the same thing.....instead of reading this.One personal note: I did not feel any hostility to any of the characters, good or bad. I accepted them as they were. The one character I did want to slap the crap out of was (Michael Douglas' on screen daughter) Caroline Wakefield's boyfriend, Seth. What an amoral, self satisfied, conceited, spoiled little brat. That shows what a good, well drawn character, he is; as was the social worker.

The Mexicans, both police andcriminals, seemed to have an unerring instinct to find anybody theywere looking for, no matter how they tried to hide, while the Americanofficers seemed totally lost.But, despite all that, it surprised me in being a very good film. Itweaves several different story lines, bringing them together despitethe fact that the characters in each line seldom came in contact withthe others. There is some excellent acting.

225,strangie,Traffic seemed to be at an amber light,6,20 March 2001,"I must admit that I was rather looking forward to seeing Traffic.  A couple of friends had seen it and thought it was really good, and if the hype was anything to go by (not something I usually look toward though, I confess) I was in to see a really good flick.  I was disappointed.The story follows a whole bunch of people - we have the Mexican cop who is wanting to battle the drug cartels, we have the judge who has just been appointed head of the Anti-Drugs Commission who has a daughter who is a user (who didn't see that one coming?), we have the society wife who is ""shocked"" when she discovers that her husband is a drug lord as well as sundry little stories off the main three.  There was nothing new being told in this film - and I thought it lacked the punch that the hype had built.  Not only that but it's overly long and seemed to be stuck in neutral half the film - it really didn't get going. The cast was terrific, but I felt that the scripting at times let them down - you can only work with what you're given, I suppose.  Traffic struck me as a little Robert Altman ish in its use of several stories intersecting with each other - which I believe to be a clever genre if used well and in this case it was used effectively.  Catherine Zeta Jones' character, Helena Ayala (not sure what accent she was trying to portray), was poorly written.  She goes from completely ignorant of her husband's business to completely au fait then back to charming society wife without blinking - thoroughly unbelievable.  Benicio Del Toro's character, Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, was well rounded and Del Toro is rightly in the running for an Oscar for his performance - very solid.  Michael Douglas is very convincing as the judge whose daughter is a user - showing real emotion.I was a fraction bemused by the sepia colours used in the Mexican scenes (perhaps it was the old good vs bad colour thing reinvented: America the good in colour instead of white and Mexico the bad in sepia instead of black). There also appeared to be quite a negative portrayal of the Mexicans with regard to 'the drug war' whether or not this is true I don't know.That said, it is worth seeing but I wouldn't hang out to see in in the cinema, it's a video flick.",Traffic

228,experten,Entertaining but half baked.,7,14 October 2001,"Traffic is an entertaining movie, but it is absolutely not a masterpiece. The scenes from Mexico are the best in the movie, but this story should have been developed more, I would have liked to see more of whats going on I Mexico. Benicio Del Toro got an Oscar for his performance and he is really cool and a very good actor. (Not only in this movie, think about his performances in The Usual Suspects and Way of the Gun).Different stories take place in Mexico and USA and in the states we get to see Michael Douglas doing his usual role as a bigwig. There is nothing wrong with his performance, he can do this in his sleep, but it is strange that such a powerful figure can do so little to help his daughter (b.t.w. excellent performance by Erika Christensen), but maybe that is the point. Some of the scenes involving MD seems unnecessary though and if I had directed the movie I would have skipped this part entirely. The other american story in the movie is hard to believe. I am not thinking about difficulties to protect witnesses, those kind of scenes have we seen many times before. But how can Zeta-Jones transform from an innocent housewife into a cold-blooded druglord ? That is what she very rapidly has to do to protect her family life in luxury, but how can she manage ? Where does she get the knowledge ? It is also hard to believe that Dennis Quaids´ character is so stupid. It would have been easy to change things so that Quaid, who knows what is going on, takes care of business instead of Zeta-Jones. The point that she is prepared to do anything to protect her interests did not have to be lost, she could still encourage Quaid to act ruthless on her behalf. The movie consists of three different stories and this fact is both a strength and a weakness. All the stories are half baked but the shifting from one story to another makes sure that we never get bored with any one of them. 7/10",Traffic

231,mattwakeman,good intentions but so let down by a packaged ending,6,4 May 2001,"This is not a bad film. It really isn't. Unlike the series from which it is based it misses out on where the drugs come from, who grows then and why they're grown in the first place. I imagine that this was done for space reasons.The film attempts to show the tangled web that drugs weave whilst looking at the effects that they have on individuals and it actually manages to come close to pulling it off. Almost. But then you get the all too neat and very packaged ending which simply ruined all that had gone before it.This has a vary good cast and for a (long) while it is a very, very good film. The immense pressures on people in Michael Douglas' position, the intelligence to realise that annoying some people doesn't make them angry, it gets you dead (a fantastic Benicio Del Toro). It shows the difference between the feel-good' rhetoric of drugs are the enemy of youth etc etc.' and the actualities of the people who are moving the drugs and making huge sums of money. Putting aside the vagaries of the plot demands in which the latest US drug tsar's daughter is free-basing like it's going out of fashion (which it is unlikely to) as well as the (massively out acted Catherine Zeta-Jones) hideously unbelievable episode of a drug barons wife taking over the reigns whilst he languishes in prison. It all kind of hangs together and it is a nice touch that the various strands of the story are colour coded, Mexico in an arid brown and the daughters world collapsing whilst bathed in ice-cold blue light.But then, well, then near the end it all just falls to pieces. I knew the film was in danger as soon as Michael Douglas began to falter in his talk to the press, beginning with the inevitable clichés and platitudes with which these people (i.e. politicians always talk) but ending with the clichés and platitudes that only actors ever say. The film started off with the whiff of realism in the air but only managed to finish with the stench of Hollywood obscuring all vision. What was the end supposed to mean? That good people who stick together with love and hope can conquer the evils of drugs? That bad people will get caught and pay for their crimes in the end? Steven Soderbergh said that he wished to avoid telling a story in which the audience felt like they were being educated. Well he certainly managed that.Drugs are probably the single biggest problem facing the western world at the moment and yet only one character (a friend of the daughter) actually looks at the prevailing conditions in society that limit some people to no opportunities and no chances. No hope and no future. And if I had that to look forward to, then maybe I'd be buying small bags of white powder to obliterate my brain cells as well. In fact the only character that has any inkling of how to really control the influx and threat of drugs is that of Benicio Del Toro. At least his character understands that the way to eliminate drugs is to reduce the demand. Give children hope and a future (even if this means in the film that it is that age old apple pie favourite of the states (*yawn*) baseball) and then maybe they will say no' themselves. And if everybody does that, then drugs cease to exist.The film has its heart in the right place but it ultimately lacked the courage to see its intentions through. It was truly hard to care about the daughter (a better story of the utter blitzkrieg that drugs can do to an individual is Requiem for a Dream') and the end of that strand was utterly bland and clichéd. Much better (in my opinion anyway) would have been to let people see that whilst the fight goes on, there isn't a lot of hope, and precious little chance of victory whilst the world stays as it is at the moment.",Traffic
232,Brap-2,Three different shades of colours...,9,6 January 2001,"I saw this movie basically for two things:1) Screenplay - For a movie that lengthend to about two and-a-half hours, I was impressed as to how the screenplay kept everyone in synch with the movie. Every scenario got it's share, and every scenario ended up blending in with everyone else's scenario somewhat.Probably the most interesting part was when Benicio Del Toro went to the baseball game at the end of the movie. I had no clue that the cast was going to come up like it did. For a movie of it's length, I could sense when it would end. For ""Traffic,"" I couldn't see it. It's like it struck me in the face with cold water softly. That element also gave me the idea that this movie had no begining or end. Everything started in the middle, and everything finished in the middle. There was no positive solution; Montel (Cheadle) continued to keep his eye on Zeta-Jones' husband, Caroline (Christensen) tried her best to get off her addiction with the aid of her parents, and Jaiver (Del Toro) saw the youth that were going to be the future in the baseball scene.2) Cinematogrophy - Spotting the imagery in a movie for the first time is very interesting and it gives you so many ways of looking at that particular movie. In ""Traffic,"" there are three basic locations for the three scenarios: Mexico (Tijuwana, Mexico City), San Diego, and Cincinati/Washington, D.C. Everytime a scene took place in Mexico (mainly Tijuwana), the camera's quality was a bit different and a strong reflective colour of sun yellow was always there. In Cincinati and Washington D.C., the colour was always a clear morning-sky blue. In San Diego, it was right in between Mexico and Cincinati.The point is, I noticed that where ever corruption lingered around (where it was visible), it was surrounded and shown by the strong yellow light of Mexico. Whenever the blue light was shown, it was in a place where order and attempted resolve to drugs was present. Supposedly, this blue light symbolized purified American; perfection. And, in San Diego,the light was not too strong. No one could tell that Zeta-Jones' husband was the leader of a cartel. No one around their neighberhood could tell.The light was neutral.Bottom line: The movie's elements' two main elements (stated above) were what I could see flat out. If it hadn't been for those two main elements, not even the acting (which was excellent, by the way) could've saved this movie.Excellent job, Mr. Soderbergh.",Traffic

I couldn't say that about many people including siblings and lovers. ""Traffic"" is not a departure for Sodebergh, all of his films are. He is an artist with a golden touch. He can travel through opposing universes with amazing ease. In ""Traffic"" the universe is uncomfortable, muddy, almost ugly and yet, it fascinates and attracts with the power of a magic magnet. Benicio del Toro and Erika Christensen are the two inhabitants of this peculiar universe that get under your skin and carry with you as if they were part of a personal experience. No, not if.

Then there's the covert racism. I've been to Tijuana, and it doesn't have the sickly sepia tone that Sonderbergh insists on filming it and the rest of the Mexico scenes in, making the country look like some kind of bizarre third-world hellhole.

That was one of the most physical andstrange performances I've ever seen. Del Toro and the actor whoplayed Manolo were wonderful as cop buddies.  The Mexican movie was fast paced, never tried to grab atsentimentality and forced one to keep up with the story and stayalert. It worked for me and I saw real craftsmanship all the waythrough. The San Diego movie lacked a sense of place, a sense ofurgency and a strong enough actress to make the story believable.I thought that Catherine Zeta Jones was way out of her leaguehere. Of course, she didn't have much help. The writing in the SanDiego movie was ridiculous and the only ones who seemed to beable to make it work were the cops with witness (Don Cheadlewas very good,) but even that element wasn't all it could havebeen. Dennis Quaid was out and out awful in this film. The closingscene where Cheadle kind of gets his revenge goes absolutelynowhere and I have no idea why it was left in the movie except tomaybe let us know that Cheadles character was still trying. Butthat's another thing. It takes Soderberg about two hours to defineCheadles character when he has the witness guy go into a monoabout what motivates Cheadles character. I spent the previous twohours wondering if these guys were good cops, buffoons, caredabout each other or themselves. The Cinncinatti/Washington movie was almost as bad, but it wassaved by some interesting filmaking. The characters were weakand the situations they were placed in were almost silly. The drugczar of the United States busts into a private school and drags astudent off by the collar. A drug dealer holds a gun to the head ofthe Drug Czar of the United States and teaches him a little lessonabout who really has the power here. Okay. I think this is the major problem with this movie. Undefinedcharacters who move through the movie and are well photographed and are appealing, but one is never moved by them. I didn't feel for Catherine Zeta Jones when her son wasthreatened. My heart didn't ache for Michael Douglas when hefound his daughter doing drugs in the bathroom. I didn't feel hisanger and frustration when he said, ""I can't do this..."" at the pressconference. Even in the Mexican movie, I felt little for Manolo's brideas she worried about her missing husband, or her pain when hedied. The only actor who really drew any emotion out of me as aviewer was Toro, who I felt was given a chance shine. But let's faceit, he didn't have to say too many of these lines. Other than that, theonly one I felt for was the kid who played the boyfriend of MichaelDouglas' daughter. I wanted to strangle him. But that might havemore to do with the fact that I really hate him on that Fox show. All in all, a very ambitious attempt and some beautiful filmaking,but there is no substitute for a strong, believable storyline andlines that a decent actor can be expected to be able to deliver.

That's the question that stuck in my mind after seeing this almost perfect film by Soderbergh, who is in my opinion one of the great American directors. His vision on the 'war on drugs' is worked out well, executed well by a terrific cast (Del Toro, Cheadle and Guzman stand out)and, in the end, absolutely destroyed with shamefully moralistic scenes. It seems to me a producer got a big hand in the end, which obviously had to send out a positive message. So after being entertained for a long time, you leave the cinema disappointed with such a terrible finish.

238,sean_36,the best film of 2000,9,6 December 2001,"This has to be the best film I've seen this year. Traffic is an extremely well done drama that manages to be insightful and thought provoking while at the same time not seeming like a paid advertisement about the danger of narcotics.  The film is about the drug trade between the Mexico and US border.  The plot involves several different story lines. Michael Douglas plays a newly appointed drug czar who is in charge of fighting the war on drugs but runs into some problems when his daughter gets addicted.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is the unsuspecting wife of a narcotics importer, who only learns of his business after he gets arrested.  Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are two cops assigned to protect a witness before trail, who also happens to be an importer.  There are several subplots as well but the real eye catcher is the performance of Benicio Del Toro as a corrupt Mexican police officer, which is sure to grab him an Oscar.  That being said, the whole cast practically deserves an Oscar.  There is not one bad performance in the whole film.  It could be said though, that the real star of the film is its director, Steven Soderbergh.  I don't know what it is about this guy but all the critics seem to be in love with him. Personally I don't think he is all that great.  Sex, Lies and videotape nearly put me to sleep, Out of Sight wasn't anywhere near as good as critics said it was and although I did like The Limey it was by no means one of the years' best.  However earlier this year the director managed to strike a cord with audiences (and of course critics) when he made the mega-grossing Erin Brockovich, putting him on the Hollywood A-list.  Which brings us back to Traffic.  The film has a nice look to it; the scenes in Mexico were all bleached with a yellow tint giving it a very atmospheric feel.  I'm kind of split on the camera work though, which was also done by Soderbergh.  Because he carried the camera instead of using track shots; scenes are often shaky and unprofessional looking.  However you soon get used to this and after 20 minutes you won't even notice it.  It also kind of helps the movie adding a grittier feel to it.

Soderberg's almost documentary-esque style of filming gives the film a decidedly realistic ambience, plus the use of diegetic sound is superb. Finally, perhaps what I found most impressive with the film is the amazing soundtrack. It may be somewhat superficial to like a film simply on the strength of the score alone but Cliff Martinez is a genius. I cannot think of a (recent) film where the soundtrack has moved me quite so much. As for Brian Eno's final score ('Ascent') well...it still gives me goose-bumps when I hear it even to this day.

241,jack_thursby,Preachy and contrived garbage,1,28 October 2005,"""Traffic"" is a movie that features three characters -- a Mexican Cop (Benicio Del Toro), a Senator who is the head of the DEA (Michael Douglas) and the wife of a drug baron (Catherine Zeta-Jones)-- and their three stories in the drug business in the US and Mexico. There's also a fourth story concerning two US cops but it's more of a sub-feature. The stories are connected, but don't overlap and the characters don't meet each other.Although this movie is intended as a ""serious"" look at the ""drug problem"" it comes across as a pathetic joke. Aside from the story featuring Del Toro, few of the situations, characters or resolutions are even remotely connected to reality. In addition, the themes and commentary are preachy and contrived. To me, this movie is a parody of Hollywood ""message"" movies. The more I think about it, as I am writing this review, the movie is... what's the word?... oh yeah, stupid.Here's just one scene that is so idiotic that it defies description. The Senator's teen-aged daughter has become a drug addict, run away from home and is living with a drug dealer in the ghetto. The Senator finds out where she is and shows up at the ghetto tenement to get his daughter back. Threatened by the dealer, the Senator breaks down and begs the dealer to turn over his daughter, and then meekly leaves when the dealer says no. Is there any father in the world, especially one who is a US Senator, who would act like this when his daughter's life is at stake???This movie was written and directed by a crew of idiots.

242,49235781,Ending Muddled in Traffic,8,7 January 2001,"Traffic (in my humble opinion) is the second best film of the year.  ""Almost Famous"" was better, but thats another discussion for another time.Traffic is indeed a fine film... star-power cast, a superb story, with an adequate script.   The visual style of the film is gritty -- no punches pulled.  The cinematography is beautiful, but in a different way from the most beautiful film of 1999 (American Beauty)...  the angles used are so ""out of the box"" that its gorgeous.What is not gorgeous, however, is how the story gets pulled together in the end.  The audience is sold-out... after investing over two hours in this film, the viewer is treated to a flimsy, very preachy, sad-excuse-for, slapstick, and quite frankly disappointing ending.  There is no payoff for the viewer.  Might as well have slapped on some footage of a man getting kicked in the groin, because it would have made for a better ending.  I won't give away what happens, but the ending takes Traffic from being a poignant piece of social commentary, a terrfic piece of storytelling (much as American Beauty was) to being another popcorn flick.  Audiences aren't idiots... yet Hollywood continues to treat the masses as such.
Don Cheadle is such a fine actor -- and continues his high calibre of acting in this film, yet at the end of the script, he's reduced to much of the same schtick we see in the lackluster Eddie Murphy films as of lateI gave Traffic 8/10, but that's being VERY generous considering the way the film ended.",Traffic

But all that came back when I got around to seeing the multi-Oscar winning movie, Traffic.It's truly hard to know where to begin in the list of weaknesses and insults this film lays upon the viewer.  The performers log in uneven performances--each of them having to fend for himself in the modulation and reality of the performance.  OK, that's the director's fault, but sometimes that can be overlooked if there's a good visual articulation to the movie. None such luck in this movie:  the directorial style is trite and derivative.  Usually cinema creates a new language which is then adopted by TV, but Soderbergh takes tired tropes from TV commercials and re-introduces them in a movie as if it were some new visual language he's discovering.Take the use of high-contrast and sepia printing in the lab for the Mexican sequences, and the absense of an 85 filter on the filmstock in order to get the blue effect in the Michael Douglas sequences.  Well, all that was done in the 'sixties in Europe, in the seventies in independent American cinema, in TV commercials in the 1980's and now in the next century Sorderbergh usues these cliches and the Academy gives him an Oscar???  Get serious.The script is laughable.  Anyone with half a brain can see holes in the plot and logic that a Mac Truck could drive through.

249,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,One stand-out story line and two good ones...,8,1 April 2001,"I saw this movie with the harshest of audiences. Nobody seemed to like it. Perhaps it's because this film was marketed as a drug-related thriller in The Netherlands, which it most definitely is not. Instead it's a multistory investigation into the impact of drugs on American (and Mexican) society. And although it has its fair share of action, it's far more a character driven event.The movie is comprised of three story-lines, of which the one set in Mexico (starring justified Oscar-winner Benicio Del Toro) is easily the best, both in a dramatic and cinematic sense. With almost European cinematography and a tale low on cliche and high on realism, it's far better than it's other two counterparts. I had particular difficulty with certain scenes in the storyline featuring Michael Douglas (as a judge assigned to fight drugs) and newcomer Erika Christensen as his addict daughter. To me, certain scenes felt just a tad moralistic. One could also hold against it, especially in The Netherlands,  that it's not exactly saying new things.Still, this is a well crafted and especially well acted film. If you prefer dramatics above action, and are in any way interested in it's subject matter, I urge you to go see it. You just might agree with the four Oscars it recently got.Rating: 8/10",Traffic

Also at 2 and a half hours nearly, the movie didn't really hang well, being quite one paced and meandery in parts.  But when it worked it worked really well.  Don Cheadle is fantastic as always and the ending is quite a satisfying conclusion.  Overall, well worth a look, but you'd probably have to be in the right (patient) mood.

253,ewa-3,"More than Oscar bait, less than a masterpiece",8,15 January 2001,"A real example of luxury casting--""bench strength"" in NBA terms. One could take those NOT listed on the poster and have quite a cast. Albert Finney, Benjamin Bratt, Salma Hayek, Amy Irving, Steven Bauer, James Brolin, Miguel Ferrer and Luis Guzman are quite a supporting cast. And given the screen time and importance to the story, Guzman should replace Dennis Quaid in pride of place in billing. But billing is another story, so...Of the interrelated stories, the San Diego cops vs. the local drug dealer (Guzman and Don Cheadle are the good guys, Ferrer the bad guy) is the most engaging, tightly written and believable, at least on movie terms. It has all the makings of a great ""buddy"" flick. Guzman is a real pro and a wonderful actor, underplaying to Cheadle's slightly more manic, take charge persona. They are excellent together and (in my case at least) that is the story in which most the emotional involvement was.The Zeta-Jones character was just a bit too competent. She goes from being helpless and scared as her husband is taken to jail to having the chutzpah to face down a tough drug lord on his turf while eluding surveillance from the DEA. And drives a REALLY hard bargin as she does it. 
Michael Douglas and Amy Irving had the unenviable task of making us sympathetic to another upper middle class suburban couple who have no real control over thier lives or that of their child. The angst was laid on too thick. Erika Christensen who played their daughter also failed to engage, but came across well as a spoiled kid who was caught in the grip of addiction.Benecio Del Toro did an excellent job as the only honest drug enforcement cop in Tijuana. His character seemed conflicted throughout the film and was subject to making tough decisions. Jakob Vargas was essentially the sidekick--they were the South of the border version of Guzman and Cheadle. Marisol Padilla Sánchez as Vargas' wife made the most of a small role and is a real beauty as well.It will not give away the ending(s) to say that the various stories are resolved in ways that will allow Academy members to vote for the picture and the actors and other artists when Oscar time comes around.",Traffic

A great performance from Michael Douglas and Amy Irving as his wife. My personal fave is Catherine Zeta-Jones who is much more than a beautiful woman here, she's a strong-willed woman who tries to take his husband (who is guilty) out of the prison. We are treated with different points of view, by loving Douglas' ideals yet we root a little for the efforts of Zeta-Jones, knowing his husband is a real drug lord.

258,Foopy-2,Like no other film I have ever seen before,9,9 January 2001,"This is the best movie about drugs I have ever seen, along with Gus Van Sant's ""Drugstore Cowboy"".I loved the directing; in particular, I liked the documentary-like feel of the movie because it made me feel like I was watching a documentary about real life, not a Hollywood movie.  This helped me get really attached to the characters (although much of that is, of course, due to the script and many other factors); normally when I'm watching a movie, I'm thinking ""well, I wonder if they're going to kill this guy off now"" but in Traffic I was surprised to find myself actually caring about the characters as though they were real people.One of the greatest things that I think Traffic has going for it, much moreso than other anti-drugwar films like Drugstore Cowboy, is due to the potential impact the film has on the general public.  Most drug films I've seen are very liberal and are geared towards a younger audience; I would be fairly reluctant to show Drugstore Cowboy to my 50-something mother, for example.  However, despite the fact that some say that we know everything Traffic tells us about the drug war, I think there are a lot of people who don't know everything Traffic tells us about drug war, and Traffic is the best movie to enlighten them precisely because it's so accessible to all audiences--not just to the Green Party supporters who think drugs should be legalized, but to anyone concerned about the drug war, whether they're ultra-liberal, ultra-reactionary, or somewhere in the middle.  For instance, my mother saw Traffic and said she learned a good deal from it.Another thing I liked best about the film was its sympathy (and realism) in portraying all parties involved--most of the main characters who used or trafficked drugs weren't portrayed as the ""no-good punks"" or ""heartless profit-mongers"" that the elderly have often stereotyped drug users and traffickers as, and most of the main characters who were fighting the war on drugs (particularly Michael Douglas' character) weren't the blind idiots that young liberals have often stereotyped government officials as.  Of course, such stereotypes do come from reality, so they should be in the movie to some extent, and they are: but fortunately most of those stereotypes weren't the main characters that the film focused on.  Rather, they were embodied by the individuals who shaped the environment around the main characters, which I think was a great idea.Someone mentioned that they thought the idea of the ""valedictorian drug user"" was a total cliche in Hollywood, but I don't think that could be further from the truth.  Maybe I haven't seen the same drug-oriented movies as everyone else, but I can't recall a single film other than Traffic in which such intelligent and downright ""dorky"" people--people like my friends, who play trivia games answering questions about Greek playwrights on their laptop in their spare time--were avid drug users.  In my opinion (and my mother's, actually), the film's portrayal of teenage drug use was actually one of the most poignant parts of the movie.And as for those people who were disappointed that the film didn't mention the legalization of drugs: I think this movie is meant to portray the problems with drugs and the drug war; it is not meant to offer solutions. Furthermore, the film would've had to be extended by at least an hour if it even delved into the issue of legalization, and moreover it probably would've freaked out conservative audience members to the point that they wouldn't listen to everything else important and eye-opening that the film had to say.  It also probably would've had to take a stance on the issue of legalization if it brought it up, and since legalization is about as touchy a topic as abortion or euthanasia, it's probably a good idea that the film didn't address it.  Taking a stance on such an issue would've undoubtedly branded the film as being either liberal or conservative: and in my opinion, the greatest asset of Traffic is that it essentially denies itself a political stance, which is a rarity amongst drug-themed films.",Traffic

260,Bill-276,"""Traffic"" is NOT the solution. You are!",10,22 January 2001,"I only wanted to review this film because I felt that so many people I've heard talk about the movie dismissed it as an anti-drug war film. I thought ""Traffic"" did an amazing job at NOT taking a side and allowing the audience to decide what it thinks about the subject. It presented a story--a very credible one in which it shows the United States losing badly to the drug trade with Mexico--and it walks away leaving you to decide what to think and do about it.The problem with so many audiences today is that they want to be told what to think. In my humblest opinion, the mainstream wants to be hit over the head with a message and when it doesn't get one, it will invent one where one doesn't exist. I actually heard someone in an elevator the other day say, ""Don't see 'Traffic'. All it says is, 'We're losing the drug war and we're not going to win it so why even bother?'"" This is NOT what 'Traffic' is about. I also had a friend tell me one of the movie's points was, ""Once drugs make their way into our family's homes, there's nothing that can be done."" WHAT!!??? I assure you, ""Traffic"" does NOT make this point either.I think the line in the film that negates those views comes at the end when Michael Douglas' character tells his daughter's support group that he is there ""to listen."" The movie definitely makes the point that our current campaign against drugs is a miserable failure. That leaves two options if you believe this. One is to quit the war on drugs, legalize everything and hang on for dear life. Or the other is to talk to these people who are creating this overwhelming demand, find out what personal and societal problems cause them to become addicts and try a more tolerant, empathetic, educational approach (see the Netherlands and their statistics on drug addicts and crime). The current strategy by the United States of thinking that blindly arresting drug lords will wipe out a major supply when all it does is create a new drug lord is obviously not working.I think THOSE are the things ""Traffic"" wants the audience to think over and to talk about afterward. It does not go into the solution whatsoever (which again is why I think so many were disappointed). But I found it to be an outstanding film for that very reason. Hopefully it will create better dialog on this sensitive subject.",Traffic

264,saugoof,Alright,7,25 December 2001,"Traffic is a pretty good, though somewhat overrated film. It portrays the ridiculous War on Drugs that US (and occasionally other) politicians run in a grab for cheap votes. The movie is quite ambitious in that it tries to show three different angles to the story. There's the side of the Mexican cop played by Benicio Del Toro who has to fight against corruption as well as drug smuggling. Then there's the two US cops played by Don Cheadle and the sublime Luis Guzman, who go after importers on the other side of the border in San Diego. Finally there's Michael Douglas as the newly appointed head of the DEA.The three stories are filmed in distinctly different colour schemes to make an easy distinction that becomes more distracting than anything else. Thus, the head of the DEA story is drenched in blue tones and the Mexican shots are all covered in yellow but the whole thing becomes gimmicky very quickly and the film would have been better without it.What makes the film good is that it generally strays from the obvious path and instead shows that there are no easy solutions. As long as there's a profit in it people will always push drugs and no amount of manpower or moralistic high ground is going to change that.Where it loses it somewhat is when it tries to hammer home some points with a few cheap shots. There's the head of the DEA who has a bit of a drinking problem himself for one. Even worse is his daughter who becomes a junkie in a badly executed ""we try to fight a global war while we can't even control what's going on at home"" point. This is really underdeveloped and badly done. Erika Christensen who plays Michael Douglas's daughter goes from the upper class nice girl who occasionally does dope on campus to a drug addict who runs away and prostitutes herself for dope within a couple of days. This is a bad lapse into the ""one sniff and you're hooked for life"" cliche that is behind a lot of the War on Drugs policy.Another lapse of taste is the ending which I won't give away here, other than to say that it's an obvious test audience ending. I'm certain that after an initial test screening a couple of hicks requested a more upbeat ending that really spoils an otherwise good film now.Unlike a lot of US movies, particularly ones dealing with drugs and pushers the characters are quite well developed and Steven Soderbergh avoids painting them in simple black and white. His direction is quite good apart from the above mentioned points. There are a lot of different characters and plots in this movie but these are woven together quite neatly. The film also never looses it's fast pace and despite it's length is very entertaining to watch.   As a point on the war on drugs Bill Hicks summed it up much quicker a couple of years earlier though, ""It means that there's a war and that people on drugs are winning it"".",Traffic
265,TigerlilyBramble_of_WillowBottom,Now get out of the car and shoot him in the head!,8,16 July 2002,"I didn't completely understand ""Traffic"" when I rented it, so I'd have to watch it again. I do know, however, that it deserved all four of its Oscars.The dialogue was brilliant, especially Robert Wakefield's, Caroline's, and Javier Rodriguez's. The writer picked realistic but intelligent-sounding lines that make it worth watching even if you don't understand the story. Sodenberg deserves the Oscar and lots of praise for a directing job well done.Benicio Del Toro, the only Oscar-winner for this film not named Stephen or Steven, was awesome. I believed his every word and action, especially when he speaks English because it really sounds like he doesn't know it fluently. He is the only reason this film didn't seem too fast, because Javier Rodriguez was really the only character that had the slightest hint of uneasiness. You can also feel the cop's tension when he has sort of a breakdown trying to get out of the SUV. I definitely want to see more of Benicio's movies, even if that means I have to sit through an action flick, my least favorite genre besides war.But Erika Christiansen, Jacob Vargas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Douglas, and Topher Grace (is that his name?) were also great. Kudos to Erika, who pulled off many convincing scenes where she was high, specifically after freebasing for the first time.

266,somehope,Too much but enough (just like the war on drugs),6,28 March 2009,"Stephen Soderburgh is one of a kind. I love his indie efforts of ""sex,lies, and videotape""; ""Bubble""; and in a strange way, ""Schizopolis"". I like it when he develops characters, but I haven't seen a majority of his ""big"" films because I see him as an innovator and more of an indie film maker. Maybe I should. I don't know.With that intro out of the way, let me say that everyone in the film under the direction of Soderburgh -- Michael Douglas, Catherine-Zeta Jones, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Benico Del Toro, the assassin guy -- everybody plays their part well and they act well -- but the issue is the war on drugs something we see only glimpses of on the news and in the streets (and, yes, in the labs and fields, etc.) I appreciate the effort of the film and its overall message that it this ""war"" is unstoppable and you take victories where you can get them. But the film, in all of its cool glory, never takes enough time to let us know these people, with the possible exception of Del Toro's cop.There's so much going on: the color schemes, the characters ""representing"" a specific piece of the war (legislation, drug dealers, etc.) with a such a star-studded cast that we always see the actors and actresses on the screen rather than their characters. Del Toro's cop, Javier Rodreguez, is allowed to be fleshed out more than anyone else in the movie. We think he is a good man, than we wonder, then we realize that is again, and then we realize why he wants what he wants. In a movie with interlocking stories, color screens, and this and that, he is a human being to whom we can relate. The rest, even Douglas' performance, fail to move me as beyond stereotypical.I don't hate this film; I just think it was trying to do too much, and lost its emotional core, except for Del Toro.

Movie features other great actors like Catherine Zeta-Jones and Don Cheadle who play their parts equally well.Movie deserves credit for it's change in cinematography during scenes in different locations. Scenes happening in Mexico are always brighter and are shot with lower quality. As we move to West Coast USA the picture becomes clearer but the brightness stays. This is a great way to express how USA and/or it's habitants are richer and live more ""secure"" life than those in Mexico. Scenes taking place in the East Coast are cold and almost blue-ish.Traffic also has a depressing ambiance. The heavy topic has that effect. It's sometimes hard to watch the struggle of the characters being taken over by drugs. Traffic is a hard movie but recommended.",Traffic

Overall, however, i was left with a feeling of ""Is that all?"" It all comes down to the final scene where Michael Douglas' character is giving his speech to the support group, and, just like another person has suggested here, it was just too much, too cheesy, and too cliché.Having said that Michael Douglas fills his role well and Benicio Del Toro was nice to watch.Worth seeing once perhaps but this one was definitely over-rated 6/10.",Traffic
276,David Igra,"""The war on drugs"" battle for battle",9,11 March 2001,"It is clear to me that one of this year's great achievement in the category of acting is Benicio del Toro's fantastic interpretation of a Mexican police officer. It is equally clear that this film will take up a lot of space at the Oscar's and most likely even at some European film-festivals. The reason obviously being it's splendor and bright scary realism. For anyone living and working directly or indirectly with the many levels of the fight against narcotics and the crime that follows, this is the film portraying their situation with upmost sincerity. The lesson learnt after having seen this film is basically this: you win a few, you lose a few That simple.

277,leliorisen,Needed more editing,7,11 March 2001,"I do not understand all the excitement about this movie. Having watched both Erin Brockovich and Traffic, the one thing I felt they both have in common is that both stories could have been told with 15-30 minutes less running time.By the final half hour of this movie, I was repeating a mental mantra....edit....edit....edit.Part of the problem for me was that the topic alone made it clear that there is no true resolution, which is part of the point of the picture. But if one knows this already, all the drawn out tendrils of plot are going to lead to nowhere anyway.I don't have an issue combining languages and using subtitles in an essentially English language film, but it happened so frequently I think it jarred the overall pacing of the film.One final thought...and I say this, because I believe that the Oscar pundits have already annointed Benicio Del Toro with the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, BEFORE the awards. Del Toro was good, but how does anybody beat Willem Dafoe in Shadow Of The Vampire this year. I think any number of actors could have pulled off a performance comparable to Del Toro's turn here. But there are only a handful that could have duplicated Dafoe's magic and brought Nosferatu to life.",Traffic
278,Ihad,mainstreamed Hollywood remake full of clichés,5,6 August 2004,"""Traffic"", a technically interestingly made movie based on the British BBC mini series ""Traffik"", comes with three plot lines and suffers highly from bad script writing. While we have no remake here per se, the script is based on original material of a 6 hours BBC TV mini series from the 1980s and compared to the original material this movie looks very pale indeed. Soderbergh could have done a lot better than this.Plot one: a new judge is appointed by the president to fight the war against drugs (weakest, superfluous); Two: an US cop duo tries to nail a drug dealer boss (cop soap style); Three: a Mexican cop duo fights drugs on their own peculiar way by working for one of the drug bosses (the heart of the movie).Plot #3 has the most screen time and is far more compelling than the other two, mostly due to brilliant acting from Benicio Del Toro. Plot #2 is so predictable that it hardly serves any purpose at all and plot #1, the father-daughter conflict between the drug fighter judge (Douglas) and the drug addict daughter (Christensen) is mediocre and shallow at best. Granted, there are a few lines that go deeper but far too few to prevent this movie from reiterating clichés.Eventually, in the best tradition of Hollywood cinema, we are catered a mainstream ""happy ending"" on all plot parts, everything is explained to the last detail, the good guys will get the bad guys eventually and the kids will overcome their drug addiction.Go see the original.5/10",Traffic
279,omouallem,The most powerful movie of the year.,8,22 May 2001,"When the Godfather came out in 1972, it did more than just open the eyes of movie-goers to the life of organized crime.  The Godfather opened up to the American government.  It sent a powerful message to our leaders and questioned their authority on the justice system.  Now, Traffic steps forward with plans to follow in the same direction.The cast of Traffic is like that of no other.  It stars Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Don Cheadle just to name a few. Separately, they are only a supporting piece in the puzzle, but collectively; they create the most astounding performances of the year.When Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is hired as the new US drug control officer, he is sent to Mexico to research the drug trafficking.  Wakefield is tough on drug violations, but unaware that the real war on drugs is right below his nose.  In his 16 year old daughter's room, lays a girl who is all too familiar with drug addiction.Another character the film follows is Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro), a Mexican state Police officer.  Javier battles the constant criticism of not following orders, and has just found himself mingling with the wrong people.A third story develops from Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whose husband is facing conviction on selling narcotics.  Observe Helena's transition from a middle-aged yuppie, to a panicky mother, living in fear of her family.Other key elements in the making of this film, are it's unique editing, lighting, and cinematography.  These may seem like little touches that have no immediate effect on the story, but Traffic would not be the same if Soderbergh had simply filmed this like any other motion picture.  Each location in the film has a specific lens color, that helps reflect the characters personality.  Soderbergh cuts through scenes in a time lapse, but only to create a more intense atmosphere.The message that Traffic sends is clear.  To clean the drugs in our country, we must reverse our war on drugs.  We must attack the demand, instead of the supply, because their will always be suppliers.  Steven Soderbergh's Oscar for best director goes untouched, for Traffic is the most powerful film of 2000.",Traffic

283,Gordon_Six_Echo,"The Best Film of 2000, Soderbergh has crafted a remarkable masterpiece of a movie.",10,17 January 2001,"With a running time of two and a half hours, Steven Soderbergh's Traffic is one of those movies that grabs you and hooks you into its world right from frame one. The film is never boring, connecting four interlocking stories, all taking place within L.A., Mexico, and Ohio, each of which are masterfully told and brought together in a remarkable resolution in the end.
The first story given to us is an account of Mexican drug informant Javier Rodriguez, played brilliantly by Benicio Del Toro much deserves the oscar for best supporting actor. Rodriquez is in the midst of taking down two different drug cartels in Mexico, where we learn that law enforcement is a profitable business. Javier is above all an honest man in his profession, determined only to recieve a little pay, stay alive, and do his job.Then the story moves to Ohio, where Judge Robert Wakefield, played to perfection by Michael Douglas who deserves a best actor nod, has just been appointed by the President of the United States as the new U.S. Drug Czar. Wakefield is a true crusader in his fight in the war on drugs, but his family life is near destruction when he realizes that his daughter, Caroline (Erika Christensen), is doing drugs right under his nose, which poses as a threat on his professional life.The third account is that of federal agents Gordon and Castro, played by ""Boogie Nights"" alumnists Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman, who capture high profile drug kingpin Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer). They plan to keep Ruiz in custody and have him testify against against the DEA's principal target of the drug business, which leads directly to the fourth story.Around the same time the feds arrest Ruiz, San Diego DEA agents arrest top billionaire executive Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer). His wife, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), is completely unaware of her husbands activities, until Carlos' business associate and lawyer Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid) informs her that Carlos is no a legitimate businessman, but the most wanted drug distributor in the nation. Helena is first stunned by the news, but then soon develops some criminalistic manuevers of her own in order to ensure her husband's safety from a life in jail.Traffic is without a doubt the most effective motion picture ever made about drugs and the terrible effect it has had on our government, as well as the youth of America. One distinctive aspect of the movie is the brilliant way Soderbergh switches the use of color in order to give his settings the proper look. The scenes in Ohio, are shot in dark metal like blue, while the scenes in Mexico consists of effective grainy, desaturated look, much in the same way ""Three Kings"" was shot. Soderbergh also puts some hand-held camera action to very good use in a number of key scenes.Traffic is an undeniable brilliant epic of a film with an effective message under its belt. It includes one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen before, and it has boosted its director, Steven Soderbergh, to movie-making stardom, in addition to directing last year's hit ""Erin Brockovich"", which I didn't rank as high as most critics did. Traffic I easily consider Steven Soderbergh's masterpiece, with ""Out of Sight"" in a close second. Hands down the best film of 2000, and it should get all the oscar nominations it can get!",Traffic
284,TheColt,Truly Awesome Filmmaking,10,6 January 2001,"When i got wind of this movie a couple months ago, I was thinking it would make for an interesting movie.  When the trailer came out and I viewed it, I got sucked in wanting to know more about what the movie was truly about.  I saw it last night at a sold out theatre (people were sitting in the aisles!!) and everyone was blown away.  This movie left me thinking how the war on drugs might be going on in this country.  It is interesting to think how someone fighting the drug war would have someone close to them as an addict.  The corruption in Mexico and the trafficing and dealing into the states was just as important as well.  Steve Soderbergh did a truly remarkable job:  It was perfect to have all the Mexico scenes filmed in the yellow hue and the Washington/Cincinnati scenes be filmed in blue...it made following things a lot easier and eventually the connections came together as scenes shifted.  Performances were outstanding: The more i see of Benecio Del Toro, the more i think he is gonna make it big one day.  I think he just did.  Douglas and Zeta-Jones did over the top jobs.

285,Tony-114,Undercooked.,6,4 February 2001,"For its concept and execution, ""Traffic"" is very well-made and crafted. And it takes the ""correct"" stance that the American War on Drugs, at least as it's now being waged, is unwinable by its very nature.
Yet in the end, what do we have? Three stories that have no pat resolutions, but no cliffhanging tension, either. It's never entirely clear what motivates Del Toro's character to do what he does (for family? for faith? for Mexico?); we never really see Zeta-Jones' lust to keep the lifestyle to which she's become accustomed (for a woman who was supposedly oblivious to how her husband made their money, her transition to hit-ordering drug moll scarcely registers), and the whole undercover segments seems to have been purloined from a 40's police caper. And I'm willing to have ""Traffic"" end unresolved, but shouldn't there be some sense of OUTRAGE that things are the way they are? Instead of feeling that we ought to do something about the drug war, we're left feeling just as complacent as if there really HAD been a happy ending after all.And whose fault is this? Steven Soderburgh's, who's likely to become the first director to be Oscar-nominated for two films in a single year since Michael Curtiz in 1938. Which, given this lousiest film year in memory, is par for the course. I can't believe I'm saying this but -- go rent ""Erin Brockovich"" instead! Better yet, go rent ""The Limey,"" Soderburgh's 1999 outing with Terrance Stamp in perhaps his best performance.",Traffic

The story was choppy and at times hard to follow but after about 1 ½ hours and lots of sub-titles the stories started to slowly come together and make sense.  What just about destroyed the entire movie was the way Soderbergh shot the movie.  I think half of the movie was shot with a 8mm hand held video camera and a cheap one at that.  There was so much unnecessary camera motion it totally distracted me from the good acting and interesting story.  And if a hand held cam was not enough we had close in shots with the main characters face out of focus and at times off the top or the side of the screen.  It looked like a ten year old with daddy's old super 8 video shot 1/3 of the movie.  What was Soderbergh thinking?  I gave it 6 out of 10 and that's generous.,Traffic

Well, I loved it. There was never a boring moment in the entire film, and I was captivated from beginning to end.The plot, in a nutshell, is how drugs affect everyone and all of our lives, from informants (Benicio Del Toro) to drug czars (Michael Douglas) to house wives (Catherine Zeta-Jones) to High School prep students (Erika Christiansen, Topher Grace): cops Javier and Monolo (Del Toro and I think Miguel Ferrer) are caught in a drug corruption, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), on the verge of becoming the nation's new drug czar, has just discovered that his daughter Caroline (Erika Christiansen) has a serious drug problem, and Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones) must do her best to protect her family when her husband (Steven Bauer) is arrested by the DEA, no matter what she has to do.This cast was incredible. Michael Douglas did a very impressive job, as did Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Miguel Ferrer. Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman added much comic relief as two joking DEA agents keeping an eye on Helena and her family. This is the first time I've seen Erika Christiansen perform, and she made a very good first impression-she had the ability to make you feel sad for her character. And after watching Topher Grace play nice boy Eric on That '70s Show, I was very impressed with how well he played the role of scuzzball Seth Abrams, who gets Caroline hooked on drugs in the first place.While some people might've been annoyed w/ the jerky camera movements (Soderbergh used a handheld camera), I found it great, since it seemed to give the movie a realistic feel. I also like the color coordination of each place: in the first part of the movie, it would say on the bottom where the story would move to. But after awhile, they no longer needed to do that-you just had to see which color was being used and you'd know where the movie was now. Very, very well done!This movie deserves Best Picture.

289,ImmortalCorruptor,so close to perfect...yet,4,1 May 2002,"I really loved so many things about this movie, but NOT everything.  The directing was brilliant.  The use of coloring gave a precise flavor that set the perfect atmosphere.  The story was believable, informative, and quite a shock to anyone who doesn't understand the nature of how the drug industry operates (at least part of it) in parts of North America. Del Toro is the true star of this film.  (I'm not going to be a fair judge. I think the man is brilliant in almost everything he's done.)  When he's on screen, the pace is perfect.  He creates intensity.  This is done by several other actors in the film as well.  Yet these actors aren't given the credit. The credit goes, in my opinion, to the actors who ruined it. My major mouthful of sour grapes came from the fact that this film was cast with some major actors.  This movie was produced, written, and filmed to be a realistic depiction of life in a corrupted world that exists all around us.  I understand that the studio wanted this to be seen by a wide audience. To get the audience=put in big names.  Sadly, for me anyway, I would've felt the multi-layered stories more significant and honest if they weren't portrayed by actors I'd never taken too seriously. If you can enjoy big famous celebrity actors working in a film that presents itself in an almost documentary style, then rock on.  This is something you're going to love. I believe, however, that the star power ruined this whole thing.  No one in this movie should have been more famous than Del Toro.  This would've made a gritty and thought-provoking piece of film that would set a standard for movies dealing with drugs.",Traffic

291,LuckyGraveyardBoots,"Slightly inconsistent, but overall great movie",8,21 February 2006,"Let's just start out by saying: I loved this movie. I recommended it to all my friends. I even wrote this review. It definitely did not get the attention it deserved. With a somewhat confusing ending and web-like plot, it was intellectually challenging on many levels--a very good thing in movies, but not too popular, as evidenced by the remake of The Manchurian Candidate and the recent flop Syriana. Basically, an upstanding San Diego businessman (Steven Bauer--whom some may recall from the 1983 Scarface) has been busted for drug smuggling. His shallow wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) feels betrayed and in danger. Two cops (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) keep her on constant watch, while guarding a corrupt tuna fisherman/coke trafficker Ed Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) who also happens to be the main testifier against Mr. Bauer. Meanwhile, back in Mexico, morally ambiguous vigilante cop Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and his sidekick Manolo execute odd jobs for Gen. Salazar (Tomas Milian) while simultaneously dealing with the fact that Salazar may not actually be as ""anti-drug"" as he says he is. Politician Bob Wakefield (Michael Douglas) must deal with the drug demons within his own home as he attempts to battle them in his career.Overall, this movie is bittersweet. Some of the characters get revenge, others don't. Some conflicts are resolved, and some aren't. Mostly this movie is memorable for its portrayal of drugs and drug culture. When you ask most people what should be done with smack addicts, they aren't too concerned...""Oh, ship them off to rehab"" ""They're all corrupt, amoral excuses for human beings"" but what happens when all that gets closer to home? This movie shows the bridges on the gap between the private and the public, especially with the Bob Wakefield storyline. The Catherine Zeta-Jones storyline seemed mainly concerned with one woman's incredible power to survive and pull herself together in the face of loss--and her discarding of any morals about drugs she may have previously had. OK. Let's talk acting. Basically, watch this movie for Del Toro, if nothing else. Benicio Del Toro is a diamond in the rough--he never overacts, which perhaps lends some to believe he is flat--but everything he does is completely natural and unaffected. For instance, his somewhat stony demeanor is temporarily interrupted by a pure animal reaction when a colleague is killed. Michael Douglas's acting is OK (not great) but I can see him acting. Del Toro I cannot. The very idea of movie cameras surrounding him seems absurd. Another cool part is when Javier (straight for all purposes) pretends to be attracted to Clifton Collins Jr.'s character in a seedy San Diego gay bar so that he can be deceived and led into interrogation. His half-suppressed smirk (which Collins must have interpreted as flirtatiousness) had me convulsed in laughter. For more comic Del Toro goodness, see him as the infamous Dr. Gonzo in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas...an experience not to be missed. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrible, for reasons many and colorful. The inflection on her sentences is wrong, her facial expressions are wrong, her character development is wrong. She neither convinces us of her love for Steven Bauer, nor convinces us she is a ready and willing adulteress. And with the drug-dealing thing at the end, that was completely out of the blue. Truly horrible stuff. I also disliked Michael Keaton's daughter. I'll give her one thing, she did ""stoned"" really well. So well, in fact, that she felt obliged to show it off for the whole movie, even when her character wasn't supposed to be stoned. I liked the idea of her character--so many great drug movies (such as Scarface, and Carlito's Way) do not have anybody receiving the brunt of drug abuse; it just shows the top lords and their glitzy lives. There is nothing romantic or operatic about her addiction. Yet why, exactly, is she addicted? I don't care that she's a popular prep, they can be depressed too, but she showed no reason or glimpse into Caroline's darker side...just a stoned prep. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman were...well, awesome. I loved them as a team. Luis Guzman just did ""Luis Guzman"" as always--comforting bordering on the vaguely irritating--but Cheadle was completely natural and played off Guzman very well--and was not, for all the comedy, 2 dimensional. His reaction at a tragedy involving Guzman is extremely sad. I won't go into everyone here, but some minor performances I really liked were Topher Grace as Caroline's well-meaning yet weak dealer boyfriend, and especially Clifton Collins Jr. as the endearingly pathetic psychotic gay assassin Francisco ""Frankie Flowers"" Flores. Collins has a tendency to completely submerge himself in his role--for example, I was surprised to learn, after watching this movie, that Collins is not actually gay. For more Grade A acting, watch him as ambiguously psychotic gay serial killer Perry Smith in Capote. I thought Frankie was a character with a lot of potential to be interesting (especially in his dinner conversation with Salazar: ""I've always liked stereos. Most people don't understand."") I was sad that he didn't have more lines.The cinematography was again incredible. At times I thought it approached the annoyingly artsy, but symbolically it outlined the impenetrability of different cultures and economic classes, with a cold blue light shadowing the lives of the upper-crust politician and his family, a glimmering golden light showing off the easy lives of San Diego rich whites, and a mud-spattered, dirty-looking front for the story of the independent cop who makes $300 a month.Overall, some of the acting could have used help, the screenplay was not very good (note quotability factor: nil) and some of Caroline's lines were just embarrassing--but some of the acting, directing, video editing, and cinematography were just too good to miss. And let's not forget how it shows up the drug issue...Conservatives, get ready to revise your opinions. A",Traffic

The biggest disappointment was Del Toro who I now believe was a poor choice for the Oscar because I saw at least 20 other superior performances. Acting means the ability to portray a wide range of emotions. This performance was a stoic slogging through the part with little acting ability displayed. This is especially true since I have seen Del Toro interviews and he is exactly like the part he played. Being your self is not acting.Another particularly disappointing feature of this film is the story of the judge portrayed by Michael Douglas. I just don't buy the line that a person in his position and power would not get help to find his drugged-out daughter in the drug district.

There have been lots of movies which tried to be an expose on the futility of the drug war, but what influence will they have on the law?

I know that Orrin Hatch has seen the film (he gave an interview to the Salt Lake Tribune about it), and I'm fairly certain that many of his colleagues, and not just the ones who appeared in it aside him, also have - because everyone wants to see a movie if their friends are in it. This is such a great ploy on Soderbergh's part. Upon first hearing about this I thought Soderbergh was doing the same thing Bunuel did with Viridiana. Viridiana was a blasphemous film made with the full cooperation of Franco's Catholic Spain - Spanish officials even praised it and accepted the award at Cannes for him, until they saw it, were humiliated, and banned it. Bunuel was delighted. So here's Traffic with a cameo by clueless Orrin Hatch, who is later giving interviews about how he supports the film's ""strong anti-drug message"", and I thought this was Soderbergh's way of getting a laugh. Then I realized it's the way he's trying to make sure the message gets to the right people.That's the best thing about the film. As far as just a film, it's worth watching, it's good, I enjoyed it a lot, even though it is a little sappy sometimes.",Traffic

301,lmitrani,"Absorbing, entertaining story of Drugs' Grip on America.",9,9 January 2001,"It's perhaps ironic that Traffic is released at a time when we're seeing less discussion of the drug problem than any time in recent memory.  On the other hand, retrospectives often appear after their time of major impact. The Drug War was a `no show' in the presidential campaign, and there's been limited discussion in recent years.  In polls asking citizens about their main concerns, taxes, jobs, and the economy top the list while drugs are seldom mentioned.  Perhaps this is because of the national drop in crime. Nevertheless, the problem is still with us, and this film is a sobering look of how embedded drugs are in our culture.  Even `nice' people, suburban youngsters in affluent homes, are addicts (who we call `recreational users').  The movie, without preaching, shows us the difficulties of eradication.  The profits are huge, the marketers are far better motivated and financed than the enforcers, the users can often be children of affluent Americans, and the `highs' experienced are euphoric.   We're reluctant to prosecute our own children and to call them addicts.Several stories are cleverly interwoven for dramatic impact and visual variety.  Michael Douglas, in another strong performance, is appointed U.S. drug czar in a high-profile `war on drugs.'  His daughter, an over-achieving student, and her friends, often get high on free-base cocaine.  In a fast-paced and well-edited story that takes us to Tijuana, Mexico City, Washington and Middle America, we see all facets of the trade and how money, sex, corruption, intimidation, politics, race and ecstasy are intertwined. There are about a dozen major characters we meet and get to know.  Many are deplorable, but have redeeming qualities that make them real.  The movie shows us the breadth of the problem, and how its eradication would not only rid us of traffickers, but also deprive young people of a pleasure source, and the marginally employed of income.  I can't say I knew every character's motivation at all times, but the totality hangs together very well in conveying this message.  A strong case is made that the problem is on the demand side, and that the combination of large amounts of drug money, lax enforcement, a limited national commitment and the pleasure our leisure class derives from drugs make a solution very difficult.
The locales and characters chosen, as well as the use of the Spanish language, convey a sense of authenticity.  Catherine Zeta-Jones as a drug dealer's wife, Don Chadle as a field agent and a host of other characters in minor roles, including some real Senators like Orrin Hatch, combine to make the acting as strong as the story.  While this may not be the best film this year, it ranks among them.  If anyone questions you about the county's commitment to fighting drugs, encourage them to see this film, and ask them for their solutions.",Traffic

Each different story is given its own visual style which is a really nice feature. The stories are well interwoven and the acting is flawless throughout. However, I felt that this film was too distant. The stories were all great but never went into enough depth to draw you in. There seemed to be so much potential but it never really came tougher.The cast is amazing, and in my opinion they make this film. Benicio Del Toro is absolutely brilliant; unfortunately you never get to see further into his character and his story which is a real disappointment. The acting is the best feature in the film; it holds it tougher and makes it a worthwhile viewing experience. But acting alone doesn't make a film. The story and directing may be good, but that is it.In my opinion Traffic is no more than good, which is a shame because it could have been great. If you're a fan of Benicio Del Toro I would recommend you watch it but other wise, its nothing special. Had they taken every story and made separate films of them then that would have been worth watching, they all disserved more time but never got it. I never got the chance to fall in love with traffic simply because it chooses the multiple stories route but never quite pulls it off leaving the stories feeling rushed and wasted.I give it a 7 out of 10 because it is well directed and acted but never really drew me in and ended up seeming rushed.

One was the treatment of the DEA agents -- I cannot believe that even an agency as questionable as theirs would be so inept. Second was the Judge and his family -- I just couldn't accept him being in his position and his daughter being so plainly stupid.Perhaps this film tried to bite off way too much.

When showing scenes in Mexico, the cinematographer changes the color of the scene into a sandish color. Gotta see it.My first time seeing one of Steven Soderburgh's films and I find it amazing.

313,Cathz,"A very impressive, serious movie",7,19 October 2001,"Having anticipated seeing 'Traffic' for a long time, I found it all in all to be well worth the wait. For a start though, I would have to admit that I do not consider this film to be a masterpiece in any way.  It has some outstanding good points, and gives quite a realistic slant on life - and yet some major flaws just spoil the overall seriousness of the issues involved.First of all, I just HAVE to mention Catherine Zeta-Jones' performance throughout this movie.  Although her actual acting of the role is excellent (in fact, perfect), I have never heard another actor/actress speak in American, English and Welsh accents all in one movie!  It is rather a shame I found this so noticeable, because otherwise I feel she had surpassed herself in this film.Meanwhile, Michael Douglas I found to be extremely likeable, which is a new thing for me. Benicio Del Toro just once again convinced me that he IS the most interesting and intense actor around at the moment.  I don't believe he has ever made a film where he has not put absolutely everything into his role, and this is no exception.  Beni, even as a less-than-white character, always carries a strong screen presence which commands a certain respect and admiration.  Don Cheadle is impressive, Dennis Quaid is also pretty good, and I was surprised to see a cameo from Albert Finney (how strange to see him in this movie!)  The drugs issues in this movie are, on the whole, very true to life and almost depressingly realistic.  I watched this film shortly after a shocking incident at my school which I found this movie echoed perfectly.  As portrayed by the daughter in 'Traffic', it is often the rich kids, with too much brains and money for their own good, who end up turning to drugs and crime.  However, in other respects this movie was rather shallow.  I found the typical all-American 'lets-all-smile-and-forgive' ending extremely disappointing and in a way it seemed to erase all morals and messages that the film was trying to get across.  In my opinion it would have been better to keep this film a warts-and-all story, which was done impressively with the Mexican scenes.  If director Soderbergh had perhaps been a little less warm-hearted and given this film a more brutal edge, I perhaps would agree with his winning the Oscar.  As it happens, I feel Ridley Scott was wronged after re-opening a whole genre with 'Gladiator'.  At least they got it right with Benicio Del Toro - a subtle, masterly performance which surely should seal his star status.6.5 out of 10",Traffic

Magnolia may have also had better camera direction, but the acting and script for both movies were better then great. But why compare these two movies, lets talk about TRAFFIC.The film had a documentary type feel with the camera never staying still. Also each story was told in different tints and colors which helped you figure out where you where and who's story you were watching. The performances were dead on with no one doing a bad job. Michael Douglas did awesome, and nods to Erika Christensen.The interesting part about it is that TRAFFIC doesn't pretend to have answers. There are explanations why things are the way they are, but no real solutions. TRAFFIC focuses on human tragedy on different levels, in different ways. This movie is far from perfect. Most of the storylines loosely interlace, while others are very involved. It seems like they tried but couldn't connect them all fully. The production was great but no Magnolia, but hey, what is...Don't see this movie if you think 227 minutes is too long for a movie, because it just might be.

Simply not enough action for me. However, I am glad Benicio Del Toro received an Academy Award for his role as Rodriguez Y Rodriguez. He was the nuts- and-bolts of the movie portraying a character of great depth and personal strife. Conversely, the sub plot of the movie, in a role supported by Michael Douglas, was a tad too Hollywood for my likes and really did not stimulate me intellectually or emotionally. On the good side, an interesting use of filters in the movie and an unexpected solid performance by K. Zeta Jones helped legitamize this picture in my book.

It has great lines. It has powerful, moving scenes. But this is one of those films that was molested by a directorial technique. In this case, it was what we call color correcting or DI, Digital Intermediary. Sodenberg - whose many films I like - chose to make the narrative storyline have a color theme. Blue-ish for the drug-addled kid. Orange-reds for the Mexico stuff, and so on. Wow. Deep.That technique, heisted from TV commercials, music videos, and hack college students, rarely suits a good feature film, and almost always looks lousy when employed for such a stretch. It usually distracts and detracts, and this film is just plain annoying. This top-250 indulgence - this highly vaunted film is no exception.***Here are the scene spoilers*** This film sucks beyond DI because...That ""let's smuggle toys made completely of cocaine"". This crappy film *pivoted* on that ridiculous premise. That was borrowed from a 007 film. When I go to a 007 film, I expect to be entertained. But this was a BIG STATEMENT Film, and it has nothing but BS and to back it. Or a poorly thought-out story. Bad story.Oh, and there is Luis Guizman's character getting killed by being blown up in an car because of an assassin's bomb. And the cutaway is for show, and it features a 50-year-old couple ducking for cover from the explosion. But twenty seconds earlier, there is a huge shootout, maybe twenty-five bullets or more BLASTING out of half a dozen guns or so. And yet, THIS COUPLE, FIFTY FEET AWAY, WAS NOT DUCKING FOR COVER ALREADY???????? Instead, they are ducking for the big car bomb explosion. Makes for good visuals, sure. But while it had visual impact, this film is supposed to represent something real, and totally unreal moments just makes it suck MORE. Bad Story.Bad (really, high-school level) story, directing, and editing.It was not cohesive, it was stupidly directed and color-corrected, it was not a great cut, c'mon, must I go on?

318,Barry Lyndon-3,Overrated,3,28 February 2001,"I applaud every effort this film tried to make, but, I believe, it failed on every account.  This is a story that's supposed to show that drugs are a major problem in our society and that we are losing the war on drugs.  Then why, may I ask, is there a happy ending?  The daughter's in rehab - she'll be fine, Benicio Del Toro gets his baseball field perfect ending, and the cops plant a new bug at the drug dealer's home (even though earlier they said they check their home and offices for bugs once a day).  To show that we are losing this war, there should have been casualties of this war.  Yes, I know a cop dies, but he was a minor character.Secondly, I love how the Steven shoots and edits most of his films, but I found his efforts to try to seperate the three major locations using high to low contrast looks to be fruitless.  If the war on drugs is everywhere - why make all the locations look different?  Show the unity of the problem.And I found the ""look"" of Mexico - the grainy, high contrast, ""ugly"" look - to be rather insulting.Finally, the casting of Catherine Zeta-Jones was wrong.  I can't believe that a pregnant woman who's husband is a drug dealer would 1) not know for however many years what her husband's job was and then 2) turn so drastically in such a period of time.  Was her desire to have her children brought up rich with dirty money really more important to her than putting her unborn baby's life at risk while she traveled to Mexico to make the drug deal?

And the screenplay was fantastic, Gaghan well deserved that oscar.But, despite great performances by all the cast members (although, unfortunately, a great opportunity was missed - none of the plots are interwined) and a superb script, the downfall of Traffic is that it's based on a TV miniseries, limiting what the director, producer and writer could have done with Traffic, and making it seem longer than it had to be (about 20 minutes too long...).Also, the plot about the senator's drug-addicted daughter is just mediocre...watch 'Requiem for a Dream' (which rightfully deserved the best picture nomination more than Traffic) and you'll know what I mean.Despite this, Traffic is still a recommendable and very good movie, but if it didn't have it's miniseries roots, it could have been a lot more (think the X-Files movie).7.8 out of 10.",Traffic

It switches for story to story depending on the location and events but confuses the audience on whats exactly happening. If the stories tansitioned to one another a little bit more smoothly i feel like it could've held up exceptionally well and caught the audience to the end.
Michael Douglas resigns because he comes across an epiphany that makes him realize that the war on drugs is happening outside of the US when it should be resolved and fixed within the country. Michael Douglas sees this war happening within his own family and realizes Americans suffering form drugs should be helped rather than killing the supplier because there will always be a demand for the product.
The colour change helped the movie by helping you know which story is playing on screen, but on occasion it seemed very over exposed. Whenever the story in Mexico would play you could tell that the picture was a little over exposed and is a little irritating to the eye. I believe that the colour change could've benefited the movie but it was sort of gimmicky to me because it just wasnt executed properly. It was just way too noticable and odd.",Traffic

Camerawork also is a major (and unique) part of this film, and it helps greatly as a story-telling device.  I don't just want to mention tidbits of the components (like the numerous perspectives that one sees the world of drugs from) of this overwhelming film, so I'll just say that Traffic' is one of the best movies I've seen, and that everyone involved in the making of the movie should be very proud of themselves.Go and see it![10/10]",Traffic
332,moviefan-50,Very complex film,10,14 April 2001,"This film showcases the disturbing realism of the underground drug world. The characters just get trapped in a vicious whirlwind, an unforgiving incessant cycle of depression and self-hurt. So many films like to portray the positive in life: people winning lawsuits, a love story, etc. However, those very films shy away from the very diverse world earth really is. There is so much suffering in the world: some by people who have no control, such as children abandoned by their parents, some by people who purposely destroy their lives, such as the drug addicts portrayed in this powerful story. This is a very complex film, intertwining 3 very different stories and characters, some of whom are drug dealers and addicts, others are law enforcement working to combat drugs. Whatever they may fight for, you'll see displayed so poignantly in this film, how they are no doubt deeply affected by what they do and the decisions they make in life. Definitely a film realistic in every sense, brilliantly filmed and directed, with superb acting, by all 3 acting leads: Benicio Del Toro (who won a well-deserved Oscar), Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Michael Douglas. You'll come out of the theater with a lot to think about, not only your life but others around you.",Traffic

While some films focus less on story, ""Traffic"" succeeds in its narrative and vision, thanks to director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan.  I would also like to acknowledge its outstanding cast, including Benicio del Toro as Javier, a Mexican police officer caught between two powerful drug cartels.  He is one of the many characters that the viewer(s) encounters throughout this fine film, including a newly appointed drug czar(Michael Douglas), his teenaged daughter (Erika Christensen), and a San Diego wife (Catherine Zeta Jones) who realizes her husband's a drug lord.  It is through these characters and the situations they are forced into, intentionally or not, that makes this film worthwhile.  Clocking in at two and a half hours, I felt compelled to know what happened to these characters.  It's no wonder so many critics loved ""Traffic.""  With its excellent direction, well-crafted characters, and a thought-provoking issue, ""Traffic"" is an intelligent film.  I strongly recommend this. 10/10",Traffic

335,jerome-23,Excellently Shot Very Well Written Contemporary Film,9,16 June 2006,"This is a severe film of incompetent people.i) A teenage schoolgirl who develops a hard drug addiction (and focuses _in treatment_ too much on her present instead of her future), ii) A powerful drug importer who gets informed on by an underling and also with little physical security, iii) A mother who ignores her daughters ongoing drug abuse threatening her and her families entire lifestyle and wellbeing, possibly due to her own declared previous drug use, iv) American Policemen who fail; get shot, can't protect their witnesses nor themselves, and end up pettily grasping for success, v) A prominent drugs politician who cannot cope with the situation he is in, vi) A lying presidential system, vii) A Mexican policeman who lacks a desire to financially improve himself, viii) A high level drug dealer who is arrested, ix) An assassin who is tortured and also assassinated, x) A corrupt Mexican military general who is killed.The strongest elements are i) A treatment centre that attempts to provide an insight into a cure, ii) A black drug dealer who mercifully lets the politician leave with his brandished $1,000, iii) The creep boyfriend who retains his desire to go to law school, meets the US Drug Tzar on, albeit immaturely uneducated, drug socio-economics and has a distrust of the previous generation.If this is how the drugs scene was seen then it's honest. The dialogue is excellent. Douglass plays his incompetent, out of his depth-although well qualified, character professionally. This out of place contrast suggests that the filmmakers see the War on Drugs as futile. The fact that $1,200USD can be made in an hour on the street, with contacts, is not a valid excuse for participation, and acceptance of its presence is not only unpalettable but unjust and suicidal.On the other hand, the cinematic judicial results are:i) The schoolgirl (whose first filmed word is 'no'), although broken from parental and macro-societal micro-rejection and non-conformity to exposed survivor, survived her experience, ii) The importer ended the film with his pregnant wife and her country club social life, comparatively large home, and business starting a boom, iii) The wife ended with her husband in his career, and her daughter still at home, a family, iv) The policeman survived, v) The politician was assured of his career, vi) The presidential system rules over a far more socially, politically, economically and factually technologically advanced country than its neighbour, vii) The Mexican policeman survived and was close to a lady, viii) The dealer shot a policeman, and provoked this policeman on his occupational hazzards moments prior to his own assassination, ix) The assassin lawlessly killed people, and was assassinated, x) The General tortured the assassin, and was murdered.The cinematic winners: Decided by achievements made after getting paid: i) The Mexican policeman who gets the park for his neighbourhood from the US, ii) The importer who started a boom in business with a new technology, iii) Mexico who gets a park, one less assassin and one less torturing General.Notable filming: i) Cars turning right, ii) The chase jumping over train tracks.The despicable, treacherous, dealer turned informer and his police escort are saved only when walking away from their car, the assassin killed by the new assassin in the car park background, the inept policeman then returns to the car only to be killed by the now dead assassin. An undertone of pollution is apparent. The politician in his role as saviour father, discovers his daughter using at home, in her ensuite bathroom, when he leaves his car to walk into his home. The viewers are shown the life of the Mexican policeman and his method of gathering income by tourists liberated from their car.The phrase used by the politician, ""self medicating"" is a powerful and libertarious phrase. His expanded phrase ""a way of self medicating"" makes it seem like a '60s' Eastern religious discipline.It is not made easy to like this film. The heroine, pun intended, is broken but survives, the main protagonist in the politician is a failed hero, the secondary protagonist in the Mexican policeman fails to achieve personal gain.The viewers are shown a black future. The death and omni-destruction in this intoxicating aspect of life is dragged into the shared future of viewer and film. The setting being very much the present day, the real world, using with a small part the shining West Wing set and the story itself set in the most powerful nation on earth. We are shown technological innovation only in the traffic of drugs. The technology of the police in their small bug is known to the audience to be effortlessly swept away. The snooping van with its supposed technology doesn't have a gun mic.The strong dialog is evident in the perhaps improvised scenes in the group of upper class teenagers. Also, the politicians being powerfully political, and the police being ordinary.A strong theme of escaping from this blackness is evident.The film stars trucks, cars, a plane, a helicopter, jeeps, suburban 4x4s, a train and a van.It is a very professionally acted film and a landmark in contempory, faux-Real World, human-issue cinema.--- by Jerome, computer coder, author, and voter of 1,000 films.",Traffic

There is something special to this movie that should not be missed by anyone and of course it's reality. You watch action films and you say to yourself, Hmmmm? I wonder how this was done and then you look at the behind-the -scenes look. With this film there is no behind-the-scenes special effects because it's so real. It seems we walk across an action film and always ends up Fictitious Sci-Fi etc.
The plot was a little complex but if you really listen to the movie it should help you understand the movie better. Each piece of event was very important a little hard to follow ,but you should be able to grasp the concept later in the movie. And to anyone who didn't like the movie I find it hard to believe.

If this movie is meant to show us that the war on drugs is silly and costly, it could have easily pointed us to that as an inescapable conclusion, but it never does. It edges to that direction delivers some powerful punches, but never a knock out. Which, as I sit here thinking about it, may be the whole point. Casting, filming, performances, scripting... all way above par. Steven Soderbergh has proven himself with this film. Its scope is awesome.",Traffic
338,Different_Voices,"Left me very, very Cold",6,8 August 2006,"Traffic is a movie I'll never really understand. Yes its intelligent, yes its very well crafted but all the same it really only demonstrates to me that Stephen Soderbergh doesn't know how to handle emotion. The film follows a number of parallel story-lines, all of which follow the central theme of drug-running. Many characters in the film are on collision courses with each other, men and women who have really forgotten who they are.The storyline sounds very promising. Maybe there is an exceptional movie in Traffic somewhere. But this definitely isn't it. For example one of the story-lines follows the tale of a U.S. Drug czar (Michael Douglas) who slowly comes to realise that maybe not all is right at home. His final speech at the end of the film is indicative of his story on the whole: yes its very intelligent, but at the same time it leaves you cold. Its too cerebral: there's really no tragedy, or even the slightest hint of emotion in the tale. The film gets you thinking, but not for very long. Themes come first, characters later, creating a cinematic experience that while enlightening us, never shocks or touches us.Another one of the story lines that left me unmoved was the tale of a Mexican cop (Benicio Del Toro) who takes on a powerful drug runner. Although there is a lot of potential there for a great story its never really used to its full potential. We never get to know the character: he's incredibly distant, almost forgotten by the film at its finale. There's not enough there for us to become convinced that he's a real hero. Although one would be foolish to call the character a villain, he never really inspires us at all.The film would have worked wonderfully had it been a documentary, following the real life story of drug addicts or drug runners. Maybe then Soderbergh would have had an excuse for leaving us so untouched by the end of the film. He could have claimed the movie was only meant to make us think, not immerse us in these characters lives. Nevertheless the direction is pretty amazing. Soderbergh has a wonderful eye for beautiful images and colour schemes. As I've said before, its just sad that he just can't handle character's lives. Steve Gaghan went on to do wonderful things with Syriana. This film however, is a major letdown for the writer. Maybe he's the one to blame: his story keeps us distant from the characters, never really revealing anything about their lives or motivations. They're cold figures on the horizon, nothing more, nothing less.This was one of those films I just wish I could have loved. Unfortunately it only strengthened my secret conspiracy that maybe Stephen Soderbergh is in fact a robot.",Traffic

The four plot lines outlining four of the areas of drug traffic and the dealing with it, in four different locations, using different filming techniques were new to me. The director, Soderbergh, has done good work in the past but this is his ""Citizen Kane"". The performances were uniformly good but this is Benicio Del Toro's movie. He owns it and controls it. Not since I saw De Niro in ""Mean Streets"" has a performance by a relatively unknown actor blown me away.In addition to all this, the film gives a message to all of us who think that drug use is under control. The message is so strong that several politicians participated in the cocktail party scene, telling new drug czar Wakefield (Douglas), their opinions on the status of the drug war.You come away from this movie excited because after all these years, there are still new ways to tell a story.

I left the theater with many of the prevalent themes lingering in my mind after sitting through an intensely intriguing film. The two most important characters, I think, are played by Benicio Del Tora and Catherine Zeta Jones.  Both would not have been nearly as effective without the talents of these two actors.  Del Tora's subtle take on the tortured cop is very representative of the film's message that we are trying to do right, but are we really making a difference?  Zeta-Jones is full of surprises here, leading us to never quite be sure what to think of here, even at the end. My only real criticism for ""Traffic"" is the teenage daughter that falls so rapidly into drug addiction.  It was a little difficult for me to believe how low she sunk in such a short period of time, especially considering her privileged background. For all purposes, ""traffic"" really is the type of movie that has been missing all year.

343,oveets,the film shows several approaches to drug use and enforcement,8,15 February 2001,"Traffic is a reasonably good film portraying drug use and drug enforcement attempts at different levels.  It touches on the actual use of drugs (which is well done as the main theme in 'Requiem for a Dream') by a group of middle class teens, not portraying it necessarily as a form of overt escapism, as is the stereotype, but as a way to have fun.  The problems come in when dependency occurs, well shown by the deterioration of Michael Douglas's character's daughter in the film.  The power of the cartels is brought across to show the futility of the war on drugs.  Personally I don't know how realistic this is, but it is an important part of the debate on drugs.8/10",Traffic

Hatch playthemselves), is either severely morally compromised or complete scum. Theostensible main point of the movie, that the war on drugs has too manyunacceptable casualties, is delivered with smarm (just like Soderbergh's Oscar acceptance speech) rather than compassion and the entire 140+ minutesgurgles and hand-wrings fitfully over its plot machinations with little drama and even fewer original ideas.",Traffic

The film shows that while drugs can be destructive in people's lives, the war against them can be just as destructive. Some of the things touched on were; how are government disregards property rights through asset forfeiture, teenagers find it harder to get regulated alcohol than illegal drugs, how it corrupts police and even governments, and turns murderers and thugs into millionaires.""Traffic"" may make you question if the billions of dollars we spend fighting drugs is a good investment.",Traffic

She's a bored, rich girl from an unemotional home--so is that supposed to explain her dependence on drugs and make the audience feel sorry for her?  Sorry, I didn't buy it.  The performances are OK, but don't deserve the Oscar hype they're getting.  The director, who shot the film himself, uses color imaginatively at first.

Here are some of the problems with Traffic:1. The cinematography is NOT innovative.  Soderbergh stole the color scheme from his own Out of Sight (Detroit was shot in a metallic blue), and just because he shot it all with handhelds doesn't make it 'great.'  If this film gets nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography, then The Blair Witch Project should've been nominated for the same award in 1999.  He wasn't even consistent with how he framed some of the characters. 2.  The points made in this film are made and made and made until the viewer feels beaten over the head.  Much of the anti-drug dialogue felt like a third-string Dateline reporter wrote it. 3.  Not enough time is spent with these characters for any of the events to matter to the audience.  (SPOILER ALERT!!)  And what motivation did Catherine Zeta-Jones's character have for putting a hit on the informant besides maintaining her upper-class lifestyle?  We go from her not even knowing that her husband's business is legitimate to her taking control of a drug empire?  Where's the transition time?  The only character that I remotely cared for was Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez, and it's only because he's trying to do good with the money he comes upon.I liked the plot in how the characters interacted, and when someone wasn't preaching about how easy it is to get drugs in America, the dialogue was decent.  But I have to wonder what this film would've looked like if Soderbergh had made it before Erin Brockovich.  Before that film (which I did like, by the way), he was an independent-minded filmmaker who made films that also appealed to the mainstream.  Traffic is a mainstream feel that tries to appeal to an artsy crowd.  One of the best movies of the year??? It's not even one of the best drug-based movies of the year.6/10",Traffic

Sure it's nice to escape the manipulative Hollywood sacharin of ""Pay It Forward"" and friends into the realistic quasi-intelligent pastures offered up by Traffic, but gritty grime alone does not a good movie make. This is a busy film with lots flitting in and out by scores of similar characters seemingly not doing much. Brief scenes dart from one part of the country to another relieve the boredom but I walked away fully aware of the fact that I hadn't enjoyed the last 150 minutes at all. None of the characters are developed beyond their pop-up introduction and they may as well have tattooed 'bad guy', 'corrupt policeman', 'dea wife' etc onto the actors' heads. Ultimately my biggest issue with Traffic was that I simply didn't feel anything about a single one of these people; they could have all died or got married or flown into space for all I cared, and frankly I wish they had.

Instead of showing how drugs are bad for your health, it goes one large step further and widens the scope of the issue. It does this by showing the viewpoints of the five most important group of people in the drug ""war"": drug consumers, drug producers, drug dealers, anti-drug enforcers and the affected families of the people involved. Many people have complained that the interchanging of the stories was too regular and too confusing.. Well that only brings out one conclusion: if they can't watch important & serious movies they should stick to popcorn propaganda i.e. Bruckheimer. The production isn't perfect, but I don't see how Soderbergh could have done any better. The camerawork was sometimes shaky and amateur but this was only done to give more realistic grit into the film, and also pay homage to the origins of the film: Traffik - the British documentary miniseries which this film is based on. The acting was mostly impressive. Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Don Cheadle give good, endearing performances while Benicio Del Toro gives possibly the best male performance of the last two years.

It's heavy, but when you come out you'll feel greatly rewarded.On a final note: pay attention to the color scheme.

It was encouraging to see Benicio Del Toro pick up his Best Supporting Actor award at the Oscars as I cannot think of anyone who has played such a convincing role since the beginning of the millennium. Erika Christensen too, puts in a powerful show as Michael Douglas's troubled drug addict teenage daughter and there are enough light hearted moments - generally between Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman - to keep proceedings from ever becoming dull. Soderbergh deserves credit too for not coming over all moral on us and leaving the notion of whether ""drugs are bad"" entirely up to us, the audience. Maybe this film's not one for the popcorn munchers out there, but for those of us who like an intelligent well acted piece of art, this is a must.

My only speculation is that the politics of the film cut it slack. The direction, of course, it terrific and Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman and Benicio Del Toro are worth watching in anything, so this movie isn't a total loss... but the script is just god-awful. Screenwriter Gaghan comes from a TV background, and that's exactly how this film plays -- like good-looking but still second-rate TV.The sequences with Michael Douglas and his daughter are straight out of the After-school Special book - predictable and badly emotionally manipulative. There's nothing interesting about this story. The Benicio Del Toro and Catherine Zeta-Jones arcs are straight out of the most boring Miami Vice episodes - mostly hollow, slow and dull-witted, with paper-thin characters doing predictable things. The Benicio arc would probably make a decent one-hour episode of a TV show by itself, but that's as good as it gets in this script. The Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman characters might be a joy to watch if only they had been given interesting things to say and do... instead we're treated to stock situations, TV cliches and unbelievably lame dialogue.And then there's the proselytizing. I'm not against this per se, and I'm certainly thrilled that these issues are being brought up in mainstream entertainment, but what groaners. You can see these speeches coming a mile away, and pretty soon it becomes clear that the characters and situations exist merely to give the screenwriter an opportunity to make a speech.I wish this movie the best and in fact I'm relieved that it's received the praise it has. Hopefully, it'll have a genuine impact. But I don't think it's fair to call this a great film or great entertainment - great direction, great actors, sure, but too bad about the weak and uninspired script. The point of it is fine, but do we really need to sit through all this half-assed melodrama just to get the point? Soderbergh should've made a documentary and Gaghan should've written a letter to the editor.If you already think the drug war is a bad thing, and you're not a gigantic fan of the director or actors, then I don't think there's any reason why you should spend two hours of your life watching this one.",Traffic

I take that all back now.  She is a beautiful and has amazing talent.  She truly is a great actress.  Benicio Del Toro and Michael Douglas prove once again that they are two of the few actors that truly can say they have talent.  Phenominal performances by both.  And Erica Christensen does a tremendous job in her first really notable film.  Though the story is somewhat old, it has never really been told from this point of view and with this awe, it hasn't been told better than this.  It deserved every oscar it got.  Go see this film.

362,Diss,great representation of the drug war on all fronts,9,13 December 2001,"This movie clearly defines the drug war from several points of view. It has a message, but it isn't preachy about it thankfully. And much of that message is open to viewer intrepretation; to the director's credit. There was a spot in the movie where there could have been a preachy message in Michael Douglas' speech, but they realistically avoided that. It is such a relief to see a movie use subtlety. The movie ranks as one of the top 5 films of 2000, if not the best. But it isn't a masterpiece, just a fine work of directing and acting.In fact, this movie shows what it means to direct and act in a film. I would hope more directors and actors take note of how it is done right. So many do it wrong...The only bad thing I can think of in this movie is the strong use of tinting. While I do like the concept of tinting, I think it is slightly overdone. But it doesn't detract from the film itself which is a good thing. Mainly because the storyline blends several complex stories seamlessly. I don't know of many directors that can accomplish this.And I certainly had no complaints about the use of Spanish. To do anything different would make a terrible film. They were trying to paint a realistic picture after all. If you don't want to read anything in a film don't watch this movie.It's unfortunate people don't realize how difficult it is to blend several stories together effectively. I have seen so many movies that can't accomplish this. If you have a short attention span, and like short action movies, do not watch this. There are some obvious complaints from these people. Aside from an early intense gunfight in the movie, there is not much else in the movie in terms of action. Watch this movie not for some special effects, action bonanza, but for a film flawlessly directed, with fabulous acting on top of a good storyline.summary: definately watch this movie if you like ""real"" movies.",Traffic

Perhaps that is why I didn't 'enjoy' it as much as either Trainspotting or 'Requiem to a dream.' They too were depressing but I though they were far better films than this.When will someone make a film where a non-smoker is the hero and cigarettes and drink are exposed as the corrupt, money making machines they are?

364,liamsroberts,A movie that is still relevant after nearly two decades.,8,15 February 2018,"When Traffic came out it won 4 Oscars including Best Director and Best Supporting Actor. I was looking forward to seeing it in film class because of all the recognition it gets. In the end I don't think Traffic is quite as good as people say it is. One flaw that stuck out for me was that at times the pacing dragged a little bit, specifically when it cuts to Catherine Zeta-Jones' character. I didn't latch to her character as much as the other characters like Benicio Del Toro's character. But the story of this movie is the most interesting part about this movie. It shows you different sides of the war on drugs and it is still a relevant topic which is why it has aged very well. One of the best parts of the movie is the arc of Michael Douglas' character. In the beginning of the film he is on the anti-drugs side of the war but towards the end he finds out that his daughter is a crack addict and then he drops out of his position. Reasons he dropped was because he can't fight a war where he has to fight his own family, he would rather support his daughter rather than be at work all day and even if he would win the war someone will eventually start it up again. Steven Soderbergh chose a very interesting choice on how the movie looks. When it is in Mexico it is very over exposed and when it takes place in Washington it has a blue tint to it.

365,Hamza21,Addictive traffic,9,10 September 2009,"The insidious nature of drugs and the efforts -sometimes useless to stop their use- are revealingly exposed through the anxious lens of director Steven Soderbergh in his work, Traffic. In a mosaic of intertwined histories, Soderbergh again speaks about a controversial subject of deep common interest, one that affects all the social layers and triggers ominous conflicts and tragedies. Two Mexican policemen, Javier Rodriguez and Manolo Sanchez, working in the border with the United States to stop drug traffic, will be caught in a corruption network. In the United States, Judge Robert Wakefield is named the new Czar Antidrug of the country, and while he looks for allies at the Mexican government to fight the war against drugs in both countries, he and his wife sinks in a personal battle against the increasing addiction of their adolescent daughter. At the same time, in San Diego, DEA special agents Montel Gordon and Ray Castro work in a case to eliminate one of the most powerful Mexicans cartel, and when they catch Carlos Ayala, key contact, his wife Helena will be dragged to the squalid world of her husband in order to save both hers and her son's life. Histories of the innocents, the guilty, the manipulators and the victims connect all in Traffic, an excellent cinematographic piece that stands out for being a vehicle for entertainment that sends out an important message. An absolute triumph of direction, screen writing and performances, Steven Soderbergh's film is a powerful ""docudrama"" that challenges our intelligence, impresses us and it affects us. The cast is sublime and everyone without exception offers a memorable interpretation. Each actor inhabits their space without nothing or nobody robbing their momentum. Stephen Gaghan's script slowly involve us in histories of common people, until we entered in the different worlds where their lives take place, from the vast and hard Mexican desert, passing by the most luxurious offices of Washington, to the suburbs where the drugs abound, waiting for their next victim. Soderbergh, a director capable of wonders, again improves himself giving the film a different look, using colors to represent diverse atmospheres and histories and using the camera-in-hand technique to intensify the realism of the scenes. Generally, the world of drugs is displayed in movies to reflect the self-destruction of the people who use them. In Traffic, is not about an affected person, the whole society is the victim, addicted in one way or other to this terrible affliction. Many people are in the incessant search of answers to end this situation. Answers that, -judging by Soderbergh and Gaghan's expositions of -, have never had effective solutions. The movie is not about criticisms, nor does try to propose ideas, is simply trying to show a reality where nobody will get away clean.",Traffic
366,tomas38,Excellent Movie,9,10 September 2009,"Actually, it is an excellent movie. Shame so many in our dumbed down society are incapable of understanding anything as thoughtful and complex as a 2 hour movie with a brain. Excellently acted with a great cast, Traffic is a quick and dirty tour of America's disastrous war on drugs. The inherent failing of the war, the movie argues, is twofold. One: The government intends to wage the war on moral grounds. The understanding that doing and selling drugs is morally wrong. This posture is hypocritical, intrusive & pretentious. What place does a government have in establishing and enforcing a code of morality? Also, the drug laws are draconian, unrealistic and inconsistent. Potheads and people who deal crack to minors are treated as one and the same. Also, there is the simple fact of the matter that drugs in America are treated with the same nod and wink attitude of every vice from pornography to gambling to adultury. Universally deplored and widely practiced. Two: By the time the gov't got around to declaring war on drugs, the superstructure of drug trafficking throughout the world was so developed and well-financed, it was like fighting machine guns with bows and arrows. Too little, too late. There are dozens and dozens of ways to circulate drugs between and throughout countries. The pipelines are mindboggling complex and numerous. Nothing less than a 100% military effort to shut down the drug trade will be of any use & that has never been the case. For instance, nothing less than a military takeover and declaring martial law in Columbia will kill the drug cartels. That will never happen for obvious reasons. By the mid 80's, when the War on Drugs was announced, drugs had been a part of our culture for decades. Movies about drug use and drug dealing were made as early as the 40's, mostly as film noirs. Sherlock Holmes, the English Victorian sleuth created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle sniffs cocaine in stories written over 100 years ago. The gov't was rather late to this ballgame. Talk about closing the barn door after all the animals had gotten out. If the American Gov't is really serious about prosecuting the war on drugs; it needs to start over from the ground and rethink every aspect in both philosophy and implication. This movie provides ample food for thought and proof of that assertion.",Traffic

This movie isn't too old and although I wasn't too enthralled by it, I do think it aged well. The cinematography may not be the most spectacular but it does has nice aspects that aren't dated yet (the tone, the shots). For me, the different tones from each location were the most interesting part to watch, seeing where they put each colour in and when and also why. I was wondering why they put the blue on only sometimes in Washington; I think I would've figured it out if I had watched closer. I think the colour tones helped move the storyline along really nicely as it created a different mood and feeling each time it switched. Much enjoyed. In the end when Michael Douglas resigned, I think it was because he finally realized he was fighting a losing battle. The drug war was hopeless and he knew it because there are always going to be more people filling in for those who get arrested. Also, he knew he couldn't be fighting his daughter because she would just spiral further; it wouldn't work. A final reason would be that he knew he was doing the right thing by stepping down; he needed to lead the next movement of helping and supporting those who struggle with substance abuse instead of fighting them and pushing them away.

The first thing that I noticed as soon as the movie started was the different colours for all the different story lines. In the beginning, I wasn't a fan of the colour changes. I found that it was distracting and made it hard to follow what was happening. As the movie went on I was able to focus on the plot instead of the change of colours. 
Overal, I think this movie has aged well. I have seen the different colours in a few other films created after 2000. Other films use the different colours in flashbacks or to set the mood. 
Michael Douglas' character was very important in this film; he was my favourite character. His character was very developed and we were able to really feel what he felt. He was trying to control the drug use in the Usa. Little did he know, his daughter was using. He could no longer work to fight drugs if he couldn't keep his own home drug free.

I found it intriguing of the reasons why Michael Douglas, the father, had resigned from the job with the government. I think the reasons he did it for was because he saw that the war on drugs couldn't be won though force on the cartels and after a cartel fell a new one would take it's place. Also he didn't want to fight a war on drugs when he would be fighting with his own family in doing so. He wouldn't be able to take the pressure of having his daughter addicted to drugs and be fighting her in fighting the war on drugs.

Each character is believable, but none of them are especially interesting or sympathetic. Yes, that means the picture is balanced. There are no real heroes, and no real villains. Unfortunately, that sucks a whole lot of the air out of what should be heartstring-tugging scenes. It's as if, in desperation to not be melodramatic, the director decided to have no drama at all. Either that or there just wasn't time to develop any of the characters to the point of likeability.

They explain that ""To a wise man, it is obviously a beautiful suit of clothes, but to a fool it is totally invisible"". The emperor ""Not wanting to appear a fool"" proceeds to ooh and ahh about the non-existent clothing and a vicious cycle continues until almost the whole city is convinced the Emperor is parading down the street in his wondrous new wardrobe when he is in fact completely stark naked.What does this have to do with the movie Traffic you ask? Well, an attack of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" syndrome is the only rational explanation I can possible proffer to solve the perplexing riddle that is the popularity of this movie.The critics, rating as they do based on artistic elements and the fine equasions that go into what they deem to be ""quality cinema"", loved the movie, and Joe Public, ""Not wanting to appear a fool"" is convinced they are watching a cinematic marvel, when in fact they are watching three hours of cinema which rivals a perpetually looped stock-market report for sheer enthrallment value.Traffic came and went from Australian cinemas in the space of two weeks.

Del Toro did alright but other than him and the youths of the movie the acting was sub-par (I especially liked Majandra Delfino from ""Roswell"" and Topher Grace from ""That 70's Show""). If the camera shots and angles had been any more sloppy (7 seconds people, the average persons attention span is 7 seconds Eyes Wide Shut is not a good film to copy a style from), not to mention the cameras themselves any more crappy (you can keep the camera balanced at least), the film would be worse than the average Indie flic.

The color is artsy.Bleached yellow for Mexico and bleached blue for the US.  The political message is so broad in scope that Democrats will be able to embrace it as politically correct, and Republicans will not be offended.  The plot is cliched and predictable beyond belief.  It steals broadly from all the drug movies you've seen.  Big chunks of the plot are stupid.  Rich judge searches ghetto for daughter.   (Why didn't he think to hire a PI?)  Cops can't protect key witness.  (They trust anybody.) Politicians argue in vain about how to/differ ways to stop the flow of drugs across the border.  (But of course no one suggests asking Pat Buchanan or the Israeli Army how to do it.)Another thing the movie does is point out how quick family members are to save their loved ones after they do something stupid.  Catherine Zeta-Jones(Douglas)' character's husband is arrested.  She yells at him, but then suddenly changes her mind, and sets out to have a bunch of guys killed.  Too many abrupt changes in story line makes movie hard to follow.  Stephen Soderbergh should have made this movie without all of the jerky camera garbage, color changes, and actually have a film score.  Please, for god's sake, change the movie when you release it on DVD. Then again, judging by how many theaters this film is playing in, people may forget that it was ever released",Traffic

As an action movie it is dull, making drug dealing seem about as exciting as the paper clip industry. Several of the characters are unconvincing in their motivation (like the preppie honor student who becomes a crack whore). I agree with its advocacy of better rehab and treatment programs, but PBS Frontline does a more engaging job of presenting that POV.

392,Mustard Seed,"Outstanding, absolutely",10,2 October 2001,"I can only imagine why this film didn't get Best Picture - perhaps it was too complex, and pushed the envelope a bit much, for a large segment of its audience.But for me the film was compelling from start to finish.  First and foremost: Soderbergh's direction and Gaghan's writing were stunning individually; but in combination created something beyond that, something that carves out a new and personal appreciation for gritty drama and dark irony.  Director and writer worked closely on this and it shows; it's something directors should do more often.The acting was superb, without exception (something I've never before said of Catherine Zeta Jones).  The party that Wakefield (Michael Douglas) attended was a treat; I cackled aloud as Orrin Hatch and the other senators opined there - but you know that Orrin, He-Devil, has an excellent singing voice.During the first few scenes I squirmed a bit, worried the entire movie would be washed in uncomfortable tints; but at the first true-color scene I relaxed, and found it well-chosen thereafter.I found it difficult to read the subtitles at times, which struck me as a pretty beat snafu given the skill of the rest of it, but overall this movie is among my favorites and a no-brainer 10.",Traffic
393,Punky Monkey,E's nekked!,1,12 August 2001,"I'm pleased to see that I'm not the only one to notice that the Emperor is wearing no clothes. Traffic was a catalogue of self-indulgence and affectation, with cardboard off-the-shelf characters and a plot could have come straight from Ronald Reagan's propaganda machine in the 80's.Far too many plot and character opportunities were wasted - particularly with regard to Michael Douglas's home life. Here, the movie chooses a 'safe', familiar, and ultimately insulting and naive route of depicting a brilliant young girl turned bad as a result of evil nasty DRUGS!It reminded me of Kroger Babb's ""public information"" exploitation movies in the post-Hayes Code Carny days. Check out ""Reefer Madness"" or ""She Shoulda Said No"" - no less complex in its commentary than Traffic, methinks. But we have no problem identifying these works as the crap that they are. Perhaps if Kroger Babb had kept is camera handheld, shot half the movie in Spanish, and given the finished print an over-exposed sepia wash...The idea of constructing a narrative from unrelated plot threads is intriguing but hardly new (I actually liked ""Honky Tonk Freeway""). However, none of Traffic's plotlines go anywhere, hold my interest or make any attempt to parallel one another.In short, I found Traffic naive and preachy with nothing to recommend it. This is, however, one of those rare movies that manages to be insulting in its badness.",Traffic
394,royalewcheese11,A skillfully constructed drama dealing with major worldwide problems.,8,15 May 2015,"Steven Soderbergh's Traffic is a harrowing look at the war on drugs – a war that is not only political, but also familial. Told through multiple interconnecting plots, the heavy themes unfold smoothly without succumbing to melodrama. It manages a tonal balance that equates to an interesting, exciting and thought-provoking experience with help from its massive ensemble cast, introspective screenplay, sharp editing and grounded though effective directorial touches – all of which earned Academy Awards for their achievements.Representing the U.S. in this modern drug war is a conservative judge (Michael Douglas), who struggles to uphold a positive reputation when emotions intervene upon the reveal that his very own daughter takes drugs herself. Meanwhile, a trophy wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) attempts to save her husband's corrupt drug business when he is arrested, while fearing for the lives of her loved ones. Protecting a witness with significant knowledge of the business are a couple of DEA agents (Don Cheadle & Luis Guzmán) who simply want to do their part for the sake of good. Finally, a Mexican cop (Benicio Del Toro) has trouble in this department when he realizes his boss may not be as dedicated to the same purpose, to say the very least.Among this stellar cast including Del Toro's Oscar-winning work, there are plenty additional appearances from other big-time players such as Dennis Quaid, Albert Finney, Salma Hayek and even Topher Grace in a surprisingly notable performance. All of the main actors convey their characters' internal conflicts with realistic nuance and along with the writing create a much more involving story out of material that may usually feel wooden due to a lack of humanness at its core. Traffic feels like an important drama that takes a grounded approach to themes that have a universal impact on people in the real world.Equally responsible for the success of the execution is Soderbergh himself, setting the atmosphere with decidedly un-cinematic camera angles and consistent cuts benefiting the illusion of reality, almost akin to the style of a documentary. The editing is commendable as the nearly two-and-a-half-hour runtime flies by. The different story lines are highlighted by different color filters, often melding with the tones of each respective segment. The soundtrack is aces too, thanks to the great composer Cliff Martinez and a particularly memorable use of music at the very end, carrying on into the closing credits which keeps the viewer stuck in a profound emotional state of melancholy as the clarity of the big picture sinks in. Everyone has once been as innocent and happy as a kid playing baseball, and only later do their lives take drastic turns leaving many of them confused and joyless, and in some cases tortured by drug addiction. Whether such detriments are avoidable or inevitable, none of it is even a concern when you're a kid on a field playing a good old game of baseball with friends and family.Overall, Traffic is a very good film that surpasses others of its kind due to extra attention devoted to the emotional end of a spectrum as substantial as the issue of illegal substances. With equal focus on technical aspects, character development and entertainment value, it evades any kind of forced sentimentality or over-dramatization and instead makes its mark with refreshing subtlety and purity oozing through each colorful frame, even including some organic moments of natural humor. It doesn't reach awe-inspiring heights nor does it falter in any particular way. Amidst the traffic of other similar films aspiring to achieve greatness, it does weave through and drive steadily ahead.",Traffic
395,brianhan-84901,A truly intriguing movie.,9,20 February 2018,"The film 'Traffic', directed by Steven Soderbergh, traces three different stories in one movie, with one theme holding them together. The war on drugs. This film is so far one of the most intriguing and creative thriller movie I have seen. With a somewhat common bond holding this movie together, the government's attempts to abolish the drug industry, the film still makes no problems making this subject seem fresh and new with creative filming and editing as well as the different story arcs. This lead to this movie standing as a masterpiece in present time, due to it's wild creativity with editing and complex yet intriguing storylines. This 18 year old film is not only a film that hasn't aged, but something that will never rot. 
 The most beautiful feature of this film are the bittersweet endings for all three stories shown in this movie. Unlike a wild racing ending like many crime action movies, the film decided to capture, bitter endings. In the end of story one, the arc with the two policemen caught in this war, we see Javier (Benicio Del Toro) sitting alone in a neighborhood kids baseball game. There are two things to catch in this final scene of the movie. We see his subtle complex melancholy facial expression, battered up and exhausted with his partners horrific death, excellently presented by Benicio Del Toro. His once sunglass shaded eyes are now visible, showing off a blank, grey pupil. However, it is not only grief we see in his facade. We also see relief, relief from the escape of this corrupt drug war. As a baseball is smashed by a child, we see his hand slowly clap subtly, but eventually forming a prayer. The second thing to notice is the baseball game, well lit with electric light. These new lights are from Javier himself, when he asked his new boss drug lord kingpin for baseball lights so that children don't have to play in the dangerous dark. These two things, Javier's relieved yet melancholy face, and the well lit baseball field, shows us a perfect bittersweet ending. The scene is trying to explain to us, without any words, that even though the war on drugs will never be over, Javier tried to make his own town a little better and safer with his small demand. This heartfelt scene is the final scene of not only Javier's arc, but the whole movie. As the baseball game continues, the credits roll. Even though it was a long movie with a whopping two hours and thirty minutes, this heavily emotional and simply beautiful ending itself will be worth your time. 
 Another bittersweet ending can be noted from an another arc. The second main arc of the film is the drug czar. After watching his daughter prostituting herself, Robert wakefield (Michael Douglas) claims he can't have a war with his own family, and leaves his position as the drug czar. This ending is quite a surprising one, as Robert showed no change of plans to his job before his quitting. However, after long hesitation, he finally speaks his thoughts, and rushes off the podium. This ending shows us that Robert will spend more time with his family after realizing that the war on drugs will never be one. The director purposefully connected the police duo arc and this arc with a smaller theme: a never ending war. Both started eagerly to participate in this forever war on drugs, each taking different sides. However, at the end, they realize what was more important was right in front of them: The daughter and the neighborhood. Arguably, the most beautiful perk of the division of stories were the overlapping themes. These bittersweet endings really contributed to painting this masterpiece. 
 Apart from it's simply amazing storyline and ending, another act we have to praise is the way of filming and editing. This movie was filmed by the director himself, and is purposely meant to look unstable. The camera is never completely still, and resembles a way a documentary or an indie film is filmed. Even though it was a movie that starred several hollywood stars, the filming and editing seemed cheap. Some might disagree, but I believe this was not a blunder by the director. To match the sketchy, unstable tone of the whole film, being a thriller, the way it was caught on camera was perfectly suitable for the tone and mood for this film. 
 In the editing process, the editing team implemented a creative way to differentiate the complex stories and set the mood: colour. The colour plays a gigantic role in this movie. It helps the audience to understand the tone and mood as well as which story arc we are in. The two police arc has a heavy orange and yellow colour, matching the deserts they are usually in. It also matches the heated action and thrill in their scenes, engulfing readers into the movie. The czar arc's colour is the complete opposite. It is a cold, strong blue like the arctic sea. It seems to display the cold, corrupt world of governments and the political side of the war on drugs. The colour freezes the audience on the spot, making the thrill of the movies scenes more powerful. This technique was not only a mere gimmick, but something that bonded the movie together and what truly painted the movie. 
 This movie was truly something magnificent. It sucked the audience in with vibrant colours. It made the audience bite their nails in the tense mood. And at the end, gave a truly satisfying bittersweet ending. This movie, though not the easiest to watch and understand, was a full course meal of fine story, filming, and intensity.",Traffic

You get a very unsatisfying film, which also has surprisingly little of any coherency to say about drug abuse and the law enforcement surrounding it.

399,cdh-2,Soderbergh scores again!,8,16 July 2001,"Director Steven Soderbergh's latest film, ""Traffic,"" covers the US/Mexican War on Drugs-specifically, cocaine-from several different angles.  Three separate but interconnected storylines show dealers, users, cops, smugglers, lawyers, government officials-everyone but the South American growers.We get to hear the arguments on all sides and see the impacts on many people's lives-innocent, guilty, and everywhere in between.  But in an early scene when Erika Christensen takes her first hit of freebase, the look of sheer bliss on her face sends the message that this war is already lost.  As long as something can give people this kind of high, they won't care about how much it costs them and not all the laws and governments on Earth will keep it from getting to them.The cast is large, full of good actors in juicy roles-Michael Douglas, Benecio Del Toro, Dennis Quaid, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Miguel Ferrer, to name a few.  Newcomers Christensen and Topher Grace stand out as spoiled teenage cokeheads.  And if you look carefully, you can spot brief appearances by Albert Finney, Salma Hayek, James Brolin, and Benjamin Bratt.  There are also cameos at a cocktail party by a real-life governor and five senators, at least one of whom (Orrin Hatch) has since denounced the film.Each storyline is photographed in a different style-all shot by Soderbergh himself, with a hand-held camera, under the pseudonym Peter Andrews. Cincinnati and Washington are blue, hard, and cold; Mexico is overexposed, dusty, and brown-filtered; and San Diego is warm and soft-focused.  At times I thought the jerky camera movement and jump cut editing started to get pretentiously artsy and distracting, but the story and the characters always pulled me back in.The script by Stephen Gaghan-based on a 1990 British TV miniseries-may use situations and character types familiar to us from years of TV cop shows and other movies, but Soderbergh and the cast make them seem fresh and exciting again.  For a change, style and substance work together, not against each other.  It was like when I saw DePalma's ""Scarface"" or the series ""Miami Vice"" for the first time.The only time my credulity was challenged was when drug czar Douglas went looking for his addict daughter in the worst-and apparently all-black-part of Cincinnati, kicking down doors and threatening an armed dealer himself. The guy's supposed to be a popular, hard-nosed, law-and-order judge.  Surely he could've found some sympathetic cops to handle the rough stuff for him. This, for me, was the only scene where the movie took a turn for the stupid. And, to the film's credit, this stupid behavior almost gets Douglas killed.Soderbergh got my attention three years ago with ""Out of Sight"" and knocked me out again last year with ""Erin Brockovich"".  He fully deserves all the nominations and awards he's been getting lately.  >",Traffic

I don't think there was much of a plot other than just watching what happens to drug dealers, drug users, and family members of both.  The police officers of Mexico and the US were the only enjoyable characters to me.I don't understand how some critics/movie goers are ""moved"" or ""touched"" etc. by this.  Are we supposed to be surprised that drug dealers can be brutally killed and double-crossed in their business?  Are we supposed to feel badly for the rich, spoiled kid who ends up being an addict with her other spoiled rich kid friends?  Should we be shocked that when the Mexican police ends up playing around with drug lords that one ends up being killed? I just don't see much of any shock factor or anything that I'm supposed to feel sorry for.  I did feel somewhat badly for the father of the addict.  He was the only one that wasn't playing with fire before he got burned.I found it VERY difficult to believe Catherine Zeta Jones's character.  She is devastated that her husband is arrested for being a drug-lord, and has had no idea that he's been doing all of this for so many years as he has somehow hid all this from her.

407,brianb0806,"Excellent, realistic movie",9,10 March 2006,"When I first saw this movie, I was living in North Carolina and had never traveled to the US/Mexico border. I had experienced the same exposure to drugs as every high schooler raised in America has but had never used drugs. I saw friends and relative self-destruct, but was not really involved in the game. I thought it was a very good and interesting movie. A few years later I watched this movie as a federal agent working on the front lines of the drug war in southern CA. I now know what an extraordinary movie this is. The story line is realistic. The cinematography is amazing. Anyone who has traveled to a Mexican border town can instantly relate to the yellow tint used in the film. Political correctness aside, Mexico is DIRTY. The only ""hero"" in the movie was the Mexican cop trying to avoid corruption. I know it is a cliché that Mexican police are corrupt, but that is easy to say until you have walked a mile in their boots. Cartels run Mexico. Work with them or die is often your only options as a Mexican official. Mex cops are paid little and have everything to lose by enforcing the law. I don't condone it, but I understand why. Traffic is the only movie I have ever seen that portrays this group of people as they really are. Bottom line, traffic is as entertaining and realistic movie as you will see coming out of Hollywood. And it has an important message. Regardless of your take on drug laws, watching this movie makes you admit that something is terrible wrong with the current policy.

Nancy Reagan would be proud of this film. Never have the media-hyped fears of the white patriarchy been so well captured on the screen. (WARNING: SEMI-SPOILER APPROACHING) For example the film fallaciously implies that the only place a rich, young, white girl can find drugs is in a poor, African-American neighborhood. With people-of-color only drug dealers and a visual aesthetic that renders Mexico as a burning hell-hole, the film also offers a distinctly racist point of view. This film is sexist too. Feminist film-theorist Laura Mulvey would have a field day with how this film offers the young white girl as the primary victim and reason for fighting the war on drugs. Furthermore, the performances are only partially believable with the exception of Benicio Del Toro who is truly amazing. His performance is the film's ONLY redeeming quality. He should be offered an Oscar.",Traffic
410,zanzibarwhite,what's going on,2,31 August 2001,"I found the movie Traffic not only to be extremely dull and slow moving, but also unbearably hard to follow.  It amazes me that anyone even finished watching it without falling asleep.  It's long winded preachy tone makes it sound like a D.A.R.E. poster.  I honestly cannot believe it was even considered for best picture.",Traffic
411,Sunny_Kumar,Good drug cartel movie,7,11 June 2019,Traffic is well organized and extremely engaging film largely from a star studded cast. Benicio Del Toro takes home an Oscar with a brilliant performance as Javier a Mexican police officer who is just trying to get by. Soderbergh knows what he is doing with the ability to control the cast and their characters and uses innovative techniques such as an interesting use of color. Soderbergh creates well in-depth stories that connect with poise and a certain wit that only Soderbergh can create.,Traffic
412,insectus,Could of been great,7,21 April 2001,"This is truly a very interesting movie, but after watching it I really think that it is over rated. The best, without doubt is the acting. All the performances are excellent, from oscar winning Benicio del Toro to  Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones, they are all flawless, I was quite impressed by Zeta Jones. The story is very well written in terms of the slow connection of the separated stories, but the stories themselves aren't that good at all, what makes them good is their connection along the movie, rather like in ""Magnolia"". The direction is good, but I was really expecting bether, in my opinion the oscar wasn't deserved. The pace sometimes is to slow for the type of story being presented. A really very good movie can't be strong or capture the audiences, it as to do both. This movie only does the first and part of the second. No one was bored by ""Schindler's list"" despite the fact that it was three hour long! Most of the people who watched Traffic with me couldn't stand it any longer before half! Finally, two notes: The photography was brilliant, a very effective narrative tool, and the score was very intense, creating an almost supernatural environment sometimes. Watch it and judge it yourself.",Traffic
413,simon24tb,Brilliant,10,1 June 2001,"This one, with ""Almost Famous,"" ties for best film of the year.  Steven Soderbergh's film about the drug war in Mexico and the U.S. is one of the most important and one of the best made films I've seen.  The cast is comprised of one of the best ever in film: Michael Douglas, Benicio Del Toro, and Catherine Zeta-Jones nail the emotional scenes perfectly and make this movie what it is.  It amazes me how Douglas, Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle, and the actress who is Douglas's daughter were overlooked for major Oscars. The great writing by Stephen Gaghan, which won an Oscar, was so pure and exceptional as well as Soderbergh's directing, which was also great for ""Erin Brockovich.""  This film truly details the world's drug problem, and if it would be shown in high schools everywhere, Soderbergh's views might change the drug world as we know it.  10/10",Traffic

My friend fell asleep 5 times in this film, only adding to the ludicrosy as to why this film was brought out in the first place. This is beyond me. Trust me, this film is best avoided. If you've got a wish to be thoroughly bored for the day, then see this. It should rise to the occasion on that level at least.So what about positive things about the film? I suppose there is one or two rather well crafted scenes in the movie, but mostly it makes for dull viewing. Even Douglas and Zeta Jones' screen presence didn't enliven the proceedings much. Very disappointing and not recommended. Certainly not a film for the family. However, another positive thing about the film is that it does portray a dangerous insight into the world of drugs. It's certainly a good thing to learn from about the dangers of drugs.This film alone makes dire viewing, but the fact that it highlights the dangers of drugs gives it reason to watch it, but mainly, it's a boring film.

Michael Douglas left his position as the head of the drug department because he could not fight a war against drugs if that meant he was fighting against his family, and because he couldn't deal with the constant questions and requests. It also appeared as if he was slightly depressed or just angry at the system and how it worked/didn't workI think that the film being shot in different tones really helped keep the viewers attention without them even knowing it.

I just don't think that Hollywood has any business commenting on the war on drugs.  I guess this is supposed to be one of the good films that Hollywood puts out so that they can get away with all of the violent unrealistic films that they constantly release.  The whole thing seemed like a very trivialized summary of the issues to me.I have mostly liked the work of Steven Soderbergh in the past, but this movie was not very good to me.  The blue and yellow color shifts were just plain annoying and I have no idea what they were supposed to symbolize. None of the acting stood out for me.This was just one overhyped bad movie.

These agents behaved like true idiots in the way they""protected"" him.  The other flaw I saw was it seemed that the drug czarcould have used his ""bully pulpit"" to make some changes in the systemrather than just throw up his hands and walk away.I liked it very much, though.  One question it implied is ""What do wedo?""  Do we legalize drugs?  If we do, aren't we abrogating theresponsibility of the government to oppose those things that are harmfulto our society?  If we did legalize drugs, would we be telling our youththat it really is OK to be addicted?

434,elsajansson9,Terrific Fik,8,15 May 2015,All-around Traffic was a fresh and accurate look on drug trafficking. It wasn't sugar coated nor was it sorrowful. The use of colour during the edited process set the tone for the film which made it feel somewhat real. Together with how the director related sound into the film added an extra dimension to the viewing experience. This was most prevalent during the first car scene.The acting in this film drew you into the characters and their stories. Personal I was drawn to Catherine Zeta-Joneses character Helena Ayala largely because of her character development. At the beginning she was naive and fragile yet by the end of the story she had transformed into a strong and bold woman. Likewise with Michael Douglas's character Robert Wakefield who played both a conservative judge and father of a drug addicted daughter. He was set in his ways about the war on drugs but by the end he no longer believed what he once fought for. Another clear example of character development.When it came to the storyline I loved it mostly because I am drawn to films with multiple story lines. The reason why I love films like this is because you get to see multiple points of view on one underlining theme. This makes it easy for multiple demographics to relate to one story. And this issue on drugs is still current which doesn't age this film a bit. Drugs and Alcohol will be an ongoing issue. I was somewhat surprised that the film was 15 years old. Overall I would recommend this film to anyone.,Traffic
435,MilanElliott,All in all very good,8,27 May 2015,"I'll be honest, I had no intention of seeing this movie but I am actually very glad I did. The movie was visually and technically very good. I really liked how the film used two different filters for the two different story lines. I also enjoyed how they kept the two story lines very separate but still left you feeling that they were strongly intertwined. The director did a great job of making you side with people who were involved in illegal activities. It also showcased that not all drug addicts are sleazy low-lifes. There are parts in the movie, that I won't spoil, that make you almost feel wrong for watching it. It really takes you on a journey of dark emotions. It was really effective in this aspect. This movie came out in 2000 and it covers an old story but I still found it really interesting. The movie may be a bit out-dated but even today it still stands as a great film.",Traffic

Also, it shows that drugs is a problem that can directly affect us, our family ,and our friends friends, as the conservative judge finds out his own daughter was a drug addict. This movie was very well structured and had a strong ending that had a big impact on me as well, but it may feel dull and a bit exaggerated sometimes; but it might have purposely done that way to emphasize the story. In conclusion, it was a movie worth seeing, and I would recommend this because of the message it gives to you.",Traffic
437,chrisunderscoreroberts,movie,8,21 May 2015,"This film made one of my top favorite films for many reasons. The writing was really really good and the story line intertwining between the the teens, the Americans, and the mexicans made it very enjoyable to watch. I think they did this well because they could end an exciting scene in one of the story lines and move to another and then they go back eventually to the first which keeps you always interested even if it's a slow scene with no action. I really enjoyed how they left out some of the end of scenes and left it to interpretation to what it would have looked like; for example when the guy is going to shoot heroin in her foot it cuts the scene, and when one guy is torturing another guy with some kind of liquid it cuts but keeps the audio. The other element I thought really added to it was the colour correction. At first I was weary as to if I liked it but after a while it made sense and I thought if it didn't have the colour correction it wouldn't have been as powerful for some reason. Maybe the writing enhanced the colour correction... I thought the acting was very mature and quite realistic. There were a few scenes that were maybe not as realistic but added for effect but everything from the sweat and dilated pupils to the tense conversation kept it very realistic.",Traffic

The plot line is really well written, but in my opinion it is overcomplicated. I feel like the film strays from the main plot line while trying to follow the journey of numerous people. I think the main cop played his role really well. Traffic was well directed by Soderbergh. Alongside him, the acting in Traffic made the film much better. This movie also had well selected music that set the scene and mood of the film. Traffic is interesting to watch because it shows what the drug world can be like. It also shows how different people can be involved. Traffic takes us into a raw Mexico and America and makes visible the corruption that occurs because of drugs.",Traffic

The tangent of story lines almost seemed too much or unnecessary at times, but even though they could be unnecessary I didn't care because they were intriguing. Something great about this film was there were so many different main characters you could relate to. Whether is was a drug-abusing teen or a father who is looking out for them.

The main idea of the ""war on drugs"" is still a huge topic in todays society and Traffic continues to be relevant. Michael Douglas played an interesting role in this movie as he started out being the voice against drug cartels. In the end he decides to resign for many reasons. Some reasons why I think he resigned is that with his busy work schedule, he failed to see what was going on in his own household with his daughter and her drug issues. Another reason was that he realized whenever they would take down a drug cartel, more would take it's place and it was a never ending loop. In the end, Michael Douglas is seen attending rehab sessions with his daughter giving her his full support. Something that interested me was how the director had different tones for each story line. When the scene was in Mexico there was a yellowish tint, and when the scene takes place in Washington, there would be a blue tint. With this simple feature, it was easy to tell what story was taking place and prevented any confusion.

Traffic shows in gritty (and sometimes brutal) reality America's drug infestation.  More so, however, it shows what happens to the people involved.

450,LkgNyc,Pretty and Potent,8,9 December 2000,"Long but very absorbing.Benicio del Toro IS fabulous: whenever he's on-screen, the attention is fully occupied by his subtle inhabitation of a multi-faceted character; his body language is perfect and his hooded face somehow reveals whatever is needed.So many other actors and actresses also deliver wonderful performances, no matter the role or level of star-power...and there's lots of both in this drug-war epic.  (The actors playing ""Frankie Flowers"" and ""General Salazar"" are just two shivery examples of excellence.)I saw the British miniseries this movie is based on (""Traffik""), and Soderbergh's version goes much deeper in exploring complex and confusing humanity, and primal, controlling forces.The movie's cinematography is sensual, with lovely hues: Mexican scenes slightly sepia; the U.S. washed in cold blue.  All locales are filmed with a caressing attention to texture and detail, whether rough and weathered or sharp and polished.For me one lingering theme of Soderbergh's ""Traffic"" was the power of strong-willed, risk-taking individuals to affect their environments in ways that may seem small and isolated, but can have tremendous impact.My only caveat is the ending seemed maybe a bit pat in terms of tying up loose ends.Warning: Considering the topic, there are surprisingly few drug and violence episodes, but those are VERY graphic and wrenching.",Traffic

I don't know why so many IMDB members have given this film a slatting, I thought it was incredible. The direction was spot on, (initially I was dubious, but I got used to the filtered lenses) the acting was fantastic, Benecio Del Toro's under-acting earned him a well deserved oscar, I used to not like Michael Douglas, now I think he's amazing and Don Cheadle is my new favourite actor. The story is engrossing and really hits home at the when Michael Douglas's character finally discovers his daughters problem. Imagine being a parent and finding out something like that. An astonishingly powerful film that will leave you thinking about it for days afterwards. Out of the 200 or so movies I've voted on, only 16 have got 10 out of 10, and this is one of them.",Traffic

454,Mb3,One of the best films of 2000.,10,28 March 2001,"""For someone my age, it's a lot easier to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.""Filmed in 8 different cities with 135 speaking parts, the three stories in ""Traffic"" unfold against a background of drug deals, drug trafficking and drug addiction. It takes a multi-angled look at the problem and it's effect on people of all walks of life. It looks at the big picture of what is being done to try and restrain the drug trade, and also shows us an intimate look at drug use within families. It illustrates how involvement with drugs has consequences for more than just those who take them, regardless of what race or class you are from. It asks us to think about what can be done about one of society's critical issues, one that affects us all.Michael Douglas plays the newly-appointed head of the US anti-drugs commission Robert Wakefield, a man shouldered with the responsibility of winning the drug war. His daughter Caroline is the third-ranked student in her class at an exclusive private high school, but is getting into drugs in a big way. Wakefield is oblivious the presence of drugs under his own roof, as he's hardly ever at home. He'll face dire consequences for his ignorance. Amy Irving is convincingly human as Wakefield's wife, Barbara. Caroline's boyfriend Seth (Topher Grace, That 70's Show) also has scenes of big impact, as he escorts Michael Douglas through the seediest of drug neighborhoods to look for his daughter, which teaches him more in five minutes than he could ever hope to learn from years on anti-drug committees.Douglas' real-life wife Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the innocent (and pregnant) housewife/socialist, Helena Ayala. She is being helped through her turmoil by her husband's business associate, Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid). Her husband Carlos (Steven Bauer) has been arrested and stands accused of trafficking drugs across the US-Mexican border. His arrest is due to the work of DEA agents, Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman). These two have a fun chemistry between them and I really enjoyed seeing them work together again after being great in Boogie Nights.A cast this good doesn't come along too often. They are all impressive, and full of powerful and credible performances. Much of the acting acclaim this film has received has been for Benicio Del Toro, in his role of Javier Rodriguez, an honest Mexican cop whose job is to stop the illegal import of drugs across the border into the US. He deservedly won an Oscar for best supporting actor for this role. But my personal favorite performance from the film was that of Michael Douglas. His role is low-key for a lot of the time, but he delivers it with perfection. Also worth highlighting is the performance of his on-screen daughter, 18-year old Erika Christensen. She is effective at capturing both the innocence and, later, the lost innocence of her character. I was surprised to learn that this was her first film role. Also watch for small parts from the likes of Albert Finney, James Brolin, Benjamin Bratt and Salma Hayek.Directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also made Erin Brockovich in the same year, he deservedly won the best director Academy Award for Traffic, after being nominated for both movies. He first got his start with his debut ""Sex, Lies & Videotape"", and is also responsible for the critically acclaimed ""Out Of Sight"". He is one of the most promising directors around today and I hope to see more great movies like this one from him. I'm looking forward to seeing his next film, ""Ocean's Eleven"", which also has a cast of numerous big stars.Traffic is innovative in terms of it's style, filmed with rough, shaky camera movements, which makes it look like a documentary. The scenes cut back and forth between the different stories, and thanks to some Oscar-winning editing, these transitions never feel forced or made at the wrong time. But the most noticeable look to the film are different color schemes which have been used for each location. This helps the viewer distinguish where we are (again the great work of Soderbergh, who also did the cinematography.) Some viewers have said this made it hard to watch, but I thought it was helpful to separate the stories and make it a visually interesting movie to watch. Music and score wise, there isn't much used, but this adds to the documentary feel.This movie is hard-hitting and honest. Once you've seen it, it may leave you with some disturbing images. It is a movie that gives you something to think about long after you've finished watching. This film is a ""social commentary"" that has much to show us about drugs, and it does so by simply observing what is going on, without attempting to provide any answers or preach to us. You, as the viewer, can draw your own conclusions. This is such an important movie, in my opinion a movie that needed to be made. 5 stars.",Traffic
455,TipsyMcstagger,Best film in a year,9,16 January 2001,"*mild spoiler* I saw *Traffic* the other day and it was the best film I've seen at the theatre in a year.  Many of the past films that won or should have won the Oscar were better, but, given the dearth of great movies this year, it should win Best Picture.  Benicio Del Toro, as the Mexican cop Javier, reminds one of a world-weary James Dean.  Michael Douglas is good, playing a non-adulterer for once.  As for some of the negative criticism on this page, a film does not have to be highly innovative to be great.  So what if Soderbergh previously used many of the same techniques, which were used by others before him?  I found the Mexican cinematography visually arresting rather than annoying.  I don't know or pretend to know why that device was used - if it was a comment on the DEA's and America's distorted view of Mexico then it contradicts attempts to show the real travails of Javier - but it was a very immediate way to transport the viewer to Tijuana without relying on context.  *Traffic* was not at all boring, and the two and a half hours flew by.  As for charges of propaganda, guess what?  Free-basing cocaine is bad for you!  Of course not everyone who does it derails his life, but many do.  If the daughter's story seems unbelievable, it is because of her uniqueness - a daughter of privilege and top scholar at an ivy prep school who likes her drugs hard and frequent.  Probably the most unbelievable thing was the notion that America's Drug Czar would radically change his mind about the ""war"" on drugs and hold his ideals above political survival.  Ultimately, the best thing about *Traffic* was the acting, and it is on this basis that it should win the Oscar.",Traffic

It might be more horrendous than Plan 9 From Outer-space, and at least it had a plot! Aside from the terrible performances given by Douglas, and Zeta-Jones, Benicio Del Toro delivers an incredible performance.  In fact, he is the only thing that is tolerable in the film.

457,fotd-1,One of the best movies I've seen this year...,9,14 May 2001,"Traffic is a fantastic fast paced story that just keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. With three great stories that never slow in there intensity . Director Steven Soderbergh tells a great set of stories in this film. The use of handheld cameras scene of the D.E.A bust and in the ensuing gun battle gives the story a frenzied pace and intensity not unlike the beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan. The Judges daughter as an addict is probably every parents nightmare, and the issue of the parents not being aware of a childs problem is obviously a common situation parents find themselves in as they become so caught up in their jobs, The Judge as the newly appointed head of the Drug task force at the White House doing exactly that and not seeing his daughters plight is a nice piece of irony within the story. The only real complaint I had was the story about the Mexican General enlisting the aid of Javier to take on the drug cartel and then his motive of being in the other cartel being revealed was a little to obvious, even though I tried to avoid reading to much about the movie and avoided looking at any spoilers it was still a little to pedictable. Benicio Del Toro as Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez good cop surrounded by corruption you knew he was going to stop at nothing to see that justice was done and that the General was brought to task for his crimes. Michael Douglas as Judge Wakefield the father who eventually comes through for his lost child, and realizes eventually that a job is only a job and is not as important as family. Catherine Zeta Jones as Helena Anala she showed an unexpected vicious streak after she was leaned on for money her husband owed the cartels and her son was threatened she played the vicious she wolf this was an amazing change from her normal role. Topher Grace as Seth he showed that he can play other types of role besides the good guy teenage characters like Eric Foreman in that 70's show and I look forward to seeing him in other movies. All in all a great movie that is worth seeing again and again and a video tape of this movie is definately destined for my video collection.",Traffic
458,MammaMiaSuperfan,Perfect,10,4 November 2006,"This movie was amazing.It takes 4 different stories in four different places and connects them with drugs.Let me start with the Washington D.C./Ohio story.... Robert Wakefield (Douglas) is the president's new drug czar. While fighting against drugs, he learns that his daughter (Christensen) is a drug user. Michael Douglas portrayed Robert Wakefield wonderfully. He's a great actor. Erika Christensen played Caroline Wakefield. Erika is so talented. She played a very difficult part flawlessly.Let's go to the DEAs' story... Ray Castro (Guzman) and Montel Gordon (Cheadle) are two cops who are in charge of making sure nothing happens to Eduardo Ruiz (Ferrer), the leading witness against Carlos Ayala (Bauer). Guzman and Cheadle are great. Their parts are very entertaining. Their characters are very serious about their work, and yet, they throw a bit of humor into the movie.Onto San Diego... Helena (Zeta-Jones) is the classic trophy wife. Helena learns that her husband has been smuggling illegal drugs into America. Only having her husband's best friend Arnie (Quaid) to lean on, Helena takes over the drug business and also tries to keep her husband out of jail. Catherine Zeta-Jones was definitely robbed of a Golden Globe. Her portrayal of Helena Ayala was incredible. She played the part perfectly.And finally, Mexico... Javier Rodriguez (Del Toro) is a cop who is dedicated to his work. While trying to help the people of Mexico, he learns the secrets of his boss. This story was very confusing the first time I watched it. The second time, however, I saw how amazing it was. Benicio deserved his Oscar. He played Javier with complete ease.This movie was amazing.

460,thehockeyczar,"""Big Stars Equal Big Hype""",4,4 August 2001,"""Traffic"" is one of the most overrated films ever made, and certainly the most overrated film of 2000.  The film starts off slow and never gets going. The director chose a unique way to capture the action, however it is little more than ""unique"" and becomes quite tiresome after the first 30 minutes. ""Traffic"" parades out a cast of big name stars, many of whose roles would be called little more than a cameo. The acting, with the exception of Don Cheadle, is unimaginative and bland.  Even the usual scene-stealing Catherine Zeta-Jones seems flat in her role.  Michael Douglas offers nothing to the film and was a poor choice to play the role of the Drug Czar. It is clearly evident why Harrison Ford (who declined) was offered the role over Douglas. Benico Del Torro is the biggest disappointment of the entire film. Del Torro won Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film and The Academy couldn't have been more off, did this guy really out acted Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator? ""Traffic"" jumps around from scene to scene and doesn't seem to follow any specific order.  The story-line itself is very good, but it is delivered in an unflattering manner.  It is a perfect example of a film that simply tries too hard.  It becomes evident from the first few minutes that this movie was made just to compete for an Oscar.  It has all of the basic elements that would make it a ""powerful epic"", but their inclusion hurts more than it helps. The drugs within the family aspect is explored in a way that is ridiculous and downright insulting to the viewer.  It makes modern parents appear inept and provides a realistic but still common place look at the teenage drug culture that offers nothing new.  The director tries to make it seem that he is the first to tackle the drug issue on screen.  The simple fact of the matter is that there have been many more films that have done it before and have done it much better than ""Traffic"".  ""Traffic"" is a boring, poor acted, less entertaining version of ""Clear and Present Danger"". No wonder Mr. Ford stayed away, he did it right the first time. 1.5 stars out of 4.",Traffic

You had to work too hard to keep the characters (and their motives) straight.I didn't particularly care for the subtitles (although the Spanish added a flavor of reality) and I thought the sepia tone was over used.Let's get really, real though.  There is no way on God's green earth that the Drug Tsar of the United States of America would be driving around the slums by himself looking for his strung out daughter.  It just WOULDN'T HAPPEN!

Not for one second do I believe it.  This guy has enough power to have law enforcement all over this drug dealer, but he just walks away.  And his wife, she just sits there and says the daughter has to find herself.A contrived movie hoping to make the point that the fight against drugs is hopeless.  It might be hopeless, but should the government do nothing?  The movie never answers that question.

464,rileyfreer,Accurate Description of the War on Drugs,7,10 April 2005,"Traffic is a very realistic movie about the drug war between the US and Canada. It's pretty long but it's understandable because it looks at the issue from many different positions. From high up government officials, to US cops, to Mexican cops, to dealers, to teenagers using the drugs and other innocent people caught up in the action. It is very gritty and to the point, showing just how much can be lost from the war on drugs, your friends, your family and your life. I think the main message of this movie was delivered quite well, that the war on drugs will never be won, it's a hopeless cause. I liked the acting and I didn't see anything stupid or out of place at all. Everything seemed very legit and totally plausible as to what could happen in real life. You really started to feel for the people at the end, though some of the angles could have had a bit more focus put on them.

465,lmphil,quite the masterpiece,9,10 February 2005,"This is quite possibly my favourite movie, as it has something of everything. I particularly enjoy films with large amounts of characters, completely different story lines, and some degree of complexity. This film has all three.Each character is interestingly developed, and characters are not typecast as being good or evil. For example, the drug dealers in this movie are shown as having clear financial motives for committing these crimes. No one is judged as being evil for dealing drugs; this is left up to the viewer. If one believes the financial rewards justify committing the crime than one could view the dealers as the better side perhaps. One reason this film is so compelling is that it shows the conflict's two sides objectively. Nobody wants propaganda.In addition, the directing, editing, etc. is all very well done. The director has some amazing shots in this movie, such as the helicopter descending. The musical score is also fitting.I find it sad that this lost the 'best picture' academy award to Gladiator. Regardless, I recommend this motion picture to my fullest ability.",Traffic
466,zacks-matsen,This deserrved so much more,8,23 March 2012,"Traffic, written by Simon Moore (the writer for the British miniseries, Traffik, upon which this script is based), is superbly crafted and woven. We learn just enough about each character to give us some insight into their motives for the courses they choose to follow. By the films end, matters are not neatly wrapped up; there is not a fairy tale ending. This simply adds to the realism of the issues presented within the movie. Furthermore, the intertwining stories drive home the fact that drugs are closer to you than you think.The script is bolstered by the phenomenal, ensemble cast. Zeta-Jones and Del Toro have both received Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Actor in a drama for their roles in this film. Don Cheadle is superb in his role. Michael Douglas gives his usual performance while Erika Christensen does a good job as his daughter. Topher Grace (of TV's That 70's Show) is excellent as her upper-class, druggie boyfriend. Dennis Quid's character, while played adequately, is underused.The stories were shot using various filters and lenses, neatly separating them as the film went from one to another and adding to the viewing pleasure of the movie. Mexico is filmed through a hand held camera and yellow lens to give it a dry, grainy, shaky look that heightens the feel of unrest involved with Del Toro's situation. Douglas' story is initially filmed in a hue of solemn, comforting blue. Zeta-Jones' story is filmed without the use of lenses, suggesting that her situation and actions are the most realistic and achievable of all those presented.Despite some dialogue that spouts off statistics and seems a bit preachy, Traffic ranks among the top ten films of 2000, surpassing even Soderbergh's other venture, Erin Brokovich. Don't be surprised if this film picks up the Oscar for Best Picture.By film's end, the message is clear and powerful.

If you want to see something really rough and utterly amazing in direction, acting, writing, and cinematography, check out the mini series Traffik from 1989, that's what the movie is based off of. Some of the characters have been changed, but it's essentially the same story. So to reiterate, yeah, this is an amazing movie, but the original is easily better. Del Toro has made and acted in better movies than this, yet this is obviously the peak of Soderbergh's career as a filmmaker. Also, there is too many unneeded language in this version.

471,docshaman,"Overall, a good film for students of sociology and criminal justice classes.",8,4 April 2006,"The film Traffic is a useful commentary on the obvious relationship between family, government, and law enforcement and the overall drug problem. One might begin the discussion with the question, is there a drug problem at all? As a former federal parole officer I can tell you that many parolees with drug problems often commented that they did not have a problem with drugs at all. It was society that had the problem and that drugs were simply a recreational alternative and adaptation to the world itself. Obviously, this is a mechanism used by deviants to manage their deviance. It is obviously a problem if your parole officer has to violate you and send you back to prison. Redefining the deviant act and finding explanations that can make it acceptable are often utilized by the deviant.I found the film useful in discussing the relationship between the three underlying components related to the drug problem: international diplomacy, law enforcement, and the family. This involves understanding the nexus between micro and macro issues. The government and underlying greed and corruption pose a systemic and macro sociological dimension. The family and law enforcement can be usefully viewed inside the labeling perspective and takes on some interesting twists with regard to deviance in general. the micro sociological issues surrounding the law enforcement strategies (the use of informants, and the typical street-savvy expertise of the narcs were excellent displays of this phenomenon.Students might understand the complex web of meanings that can both explain and obfuscate the so-called drug problem. Deviance is relative to the context in which it is found. It is again similar to the other categories of deviance easily classified in criminal justice courses, but becomes problematic in the domain of the sociologist.The following issues are raised in terms of both juvenile justice, deviance, and general introduction to criminal justice course work:In the movie, TRAFFIC, the main themes surrounding the drug problem are portrayed. What do you think is the solution to the drug problem? Is there a drug problem? does rehabilitation, law enforcement, or international diplomacy play the key role(s) in solving the problem? Is one more important than the other?How does the family contribute to the problem of drug abuse? What is the attitude of the parents, the spouse? and how does the family play a role in the overall drug abuse problem?What is the relationship between government, the individual families, and law enforcement and how does each interact with the other in contributing to the overall drug problem/solution?",Traffic

However, the film as a whole is not satisfying. During many of the scenes involving the ""Michael Douglas and his Daughter"" thread, I was bored because of the sheer predictability of it all. Although the chemistry between Cheadle and Guzman in the DEA thread is enjoyable, it's something that has already been done before in a number of movies. It appears as if the only thread that brings something new to the table, is that involving 'Manolo' and 'Javier' (del Toro). In addition, most likely due to Soderbergh's ""realism"" angle, the film is awfully slow-paced; in some scenes, downright boring. Soderbergh's earlier effort ""Erin Brockovich"" is by far the better of the two, and I don't see how this movie can beat an epic like ""Gladiator"" for the title of ""Movie of the Year"", which seems to be a possibility. But I don't let critics make my opinion and you shouldn't either.

479,jimmy-120,A unique and terrific film,10,20 January 2001,"The world of film criticism is filled with cliches, but I will submit yet one more:  this film was one of the best I have seen in a long time.  The plot has been covered, so there is no need for me to do that again; but what needs to be stressed, above all the good things about this film, is the quality of performance by the actors.  Benicio Del Toro played a character that I will not soon forget, and his Golden Globe nomination proves that (as should his win).  A pregnant Catherine Zeta-Jones' character was not only beautiful but believable in its complexity.  Michael Douglas is Michael Douglas, and I think he is beginning to turn his ""name brand"" into something more than meaning just a solid performance.  Juan Guzman and Don Cheadle are hilarious.  Particularly Guzman, who, as Paul Thomas Anderson might say, was F***ing terrific.  And don't forget Miguel Ferrer playing yet another nasty person (I am reminded of his character in Twin Peaks, who gets decked by Sheriff Truman and threatens a lawsuit).They all blend into an intriguing film that I could have watched for another hour or two and not felt encumbered or angered by the loss of time. Benicio Del Toro deserves an Oscar nomination, but I think most people understand that he will probably not get it.  And this is a shame too.  But if you have followed the Oscars over its history you understand that the award has always been a popularity contest, the award is given out to bolster the image of the film industry.  Just look at all the great films and great performances that have never won  and all those that have been forgotten that actually did.  But I don't want this film to be forgotten.  It has something to say, and it doesn't hit you over the head with it.  To put this review even more briefly, and to add yet another cliche: go see this film. Notice the rating by IMD users.

If there is any justice in the world, come Oscar night the name Steven Soderbergh will be announced as the Best Director Oscar winner of the year 2000, not for Erin Brockovich, but for his gorgeous film opera Traffic.

481,josh-162,Unique and engrossing,9,8 January 2001,"Like all of Steven Soderbergh's movies, Traffic does not fit completely into any category. Each of the movie's five overlapping storylines has its own unique look and feel: one minute you're watching Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman in a buddy cop picture, (complete with good cop/bad cop routine and one-liners); the next, you're watching Michael Douglas in an after school special. Does this interfere with cohesion? Yes. Does it cost the movie in terms of dramatic impact? Of course. This is not a movie with a spare, elegant narrative arc; it is not an emotional bombshell. Soderbergh's genius lies in recognising this as a necessity and playing to it: instead of trying to maintain a consistent tone for three hours and 30-some speaking characters, he gives each storyline its own tone of dialogue, color scheme and editing style. He could have made a three hour epic about any one of his themes (trafficking, corruption, addiction, public policy, money laundering,) maintaining a consistent message. Instead, he made a series of loosely organised shorts, threw in an enormous amount of detail, and explored almost every aspect of the drug problem.Everyone gets their say in Traffic: DEA agents tell us that drug trafficking is immoral and strictly a law enforcement issue; a mid-level trafficker argues in turn that he is on the side of history. A teenage cynic (Topher Grace, brilliantly slimey,) rails against uneven enforcement of drug laws; an angry parent responds with a long, contemptuous look that asks where a spoiled little rich boy gets off lecturing him about the realities of the world. I have heard this movie decried as both preachy leftwing propaganda and preachy rightwing propaganda, (although most people seem to *really* like it,) and what strikes me is this: every claim made in Traffic is disputed. There are no easy answers, nothing is agreed on, and nothing is solved. And in that, in feels more like a documentary than anything else.Plus, the last shot is haunting.",Traffic

Weaving back in forth between very different settings and story lines would be confusing, you would think, but it is done effortlessly.

Michael Douglas is excellent as usual, boy does he have an eye for a good script. He also has an eye for a good woman...Catherine Zeta Jones is rather good in it also. Benicio Del Toro got all the praise he deserved for this film. It is what I like to call a ""well screwed together"" film. By that I mean all the storyline points have maximum effect due to the quality of acting, music and cinematography. Great use of Brian Eno's music, and effective use of colour filtering to convey mood. Just watch it and be absorbed.Edit (After having watched the TV Mini-series on which it is based)I say based but it is mostly a straight copy apart from the Mexico/Pakistan parallel. Whilst my comments about visuals and style still stand, less credit should go to Soderbergh. I'm still a big fan of his but the scope and variety of plot lines and characters come directly from the mini-series.In conclusion, the film is the series compressed and stylised into a nice bitesized Hollywood chunk. Well done to the teams that produced both film and series.",Traffic
487,lilsuburbboy,This Movie is All About One Actor to Me,9,6 June 2004,"Traffic follows the effective, but not-so-often utilized method of crossing over many stories into one central theme. Another movie for reference may be Magnolia. It is a presentation about the institution, effect, and battle against drugs.On one side you have an unknowing wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who must take over a drug empire once her husband (candidly played by Steven Bauer) is indicted on trafficking charges. On the other, is the newly appointed ""drug czar"" (Michael Douglas), who attempts to ""go to the front"" and attack the enigmatic problem of curbing the demand for drugs in the U.S. Interestingly, all the while, his daughter (a straight A student with a seemingly bright future) is falling victim to her own battle with drugs.The story does not stop there. Perhaps the most provocative, though hardest-to-follow aspect, is the corruption that befalls Benicio Del Toro's character, Javier Rodriguez. He brilliantly plays a common Tijuana cop who discovers an army-run drug ring, and throughout the movie, internally battles with himself about whether or not he should share his knowledge with the D.E.A. in the States, all the while fearing for his life in the process.Although the Mexico sequences seem at first not to correlate with the rest of the movie, and the subtitles are difficult to follow (the only movie with subtitles that I really enjoy is Seven Samurai), it is Del Toro's performance and the fate of his character that make you want to watch. Put another way, he is not the reason I went to see the movie in the theaters, but he was the reason I stayed. And although it might be crude to say that the whole movie's credibility falls on him, Del Toro was definitely deserving of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar he won for this role.The movie itself attempts to approach the ""drug issue"" from an objective standpoint, and for the most part it does. There are times when the script is lagging, but that tends to appear in many movies. I would rate this movie at 4.5 stars, leaving only the landmark films to become 5s. For an interesting, thought-provoking film go see this movie.",Traffic
488,sharkie-294-946704,decent!,7,18 February 2012,"I've been remiss in not discussing the acting earlier. This film has an amazing ensemble cast where everybody is working at the top of their game. However, Benicio Del Toro definitely stands out with the breakthrough performance. I don't think it's accidental that the movie begins and ends with shots of him. He plays Javier Rodriguez, a Mexican police officer caught in a futile and corrupt system, and it's as compelling of a character as Michael Corleone. Del Toro is exceptionally relaxed and subtle, keeping his thoughts and feelings private from the other characters in the films, but sharing it with the camera. Del Toro navigates the audience through a world of impossible choices and moral corruption, quietly simmering with intense conflict just beneath the surface. Benicio's been an indie stalwart for years, but this film should shoot his stock through the roof. If there's justice in this world, he'll be rewarded with Best Actor Awards aplenty.Michael Douglas is also terrific, adding another strong performance to his gallery of flawed men in power. He shows genuine fear and vulnerability in a harrowing scene in which he searches for his daughter in a drug dealer's den. I've never seen Erika Christensen before, but she makes an impressive debut. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman (they should star as a team in every movie!) are as loose, limber and spontaneous as ever, providing plenty of comic relief as well as keeping it real. Catherine Zeta-Jones takes a complete 180 from her past roles and admirably plays against her looks, appearing very pregnant while thrown into gritty surroundings. Dennis Quaid is appropriately slimy as a corrupt lawyer.Anyway, film geeks and anybody else starved for a genuine piece of filmmaking should breathe a sigh of relief and give thanks that Soderbergh has come to save the day.",Traffic

I thought Soderbergh was a guru for thinking all this up until I paid a random visit to the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City soon after seeing the film. The Museum showed clips from a British television series called ""Traffik"" which aired in the early 90s. The plot was EXACTLY the same; only the locations were different. So Soderbergh is less brilliant than I first assumed, but his cinematographic techniques have to be commended, along with the performances he got out of the cast.

The acting is great, each character is unique and help us to understand the reality of different places, the one that I like most is probably Benicio del Toro that shows his feelings and emotions just with his face and body, he doesn't even need to talk. The stories are set in different cities and are characterized by different vivid chromatic colors. An episode, set in Tijuana in Mexico, is filmed in a way that every scene change quickly, the muggy yellow color of this story shows the difficult atmosphere of a country where corruption is clearly visible. The scenes filmed in Messico look like old paintings. Ohio and the rooms of power in Washington are wrapped in a blue that is cold and gelid; the main character of this story is Robert Wakefield ,that works against the big world of drugs, but he doesn't even know how to fight this problem in the intimacy of his family; the cold colors of the city are perfect to represent the cold atmosphere inside his family. The sky of San Diego has a neutral light but this apparent perfection is not real.

I enjoyed that in Mexico everyone speaks Mexican during the whole movie and this makes it more real. The actors are remarkable, first of all Benicio Del Toro who deserved the Oscar for best supporting actor. Sometimes I found myself a little bit uncomfortable because this movie faces a really heavy topic and I felt those feelings not because I didn't like the movie, that I love it, but because the subject, I didn't know a lot of things about that. It's interesting that even if this movie was filmed 15 years ago, we nowadays have almost the same problem regard the drugs.

The stories are interconnected and although the characters do not meet their actions influence one another. Traffic does show some of the effects that the drug trade has on people. Several innocent lives are cut short and previously law abiding citizens are turned into criminals, by the drug trade. The futility of the ""war on drugs"" is also well illustrated as one drug lord escapes prosecution when a key witness is killed. The problem with the film is that in attempting to show the drug trade from so many different angles it spreads itself to thin and none of the stories or issues get looked at in enough detail.

One small complaint, I would have liked them to reduce the level of sepia tone in the Mexican scenes. I know why they did it and I agree with the decision, but it was a bit over done at times. The three stories themselves were stand alone movies, each good enough to have been a great movie on it's own. Steven Soderbergh  has done Altman here and has done it better than Altman ever has.

Robert DeNiro is the only other actor whose movies I will watch because of his name being associated with them.  Del Toro has joined such fine company.  I would have to say, hands down, that Del Toro is one of the top five actors in Hollywood today.The negatives of this movie were the length (2 hours would have been sufficient) and the atrocious acting of Catherine Zeta-Jones.

This character goes from business accomplice of Carl Ayala, to making a silent pass at Helena Ayala, to being murdered by Carl's thugs for plotting against him. These are the only three scenes that this character really appears in the film so I assume that any other developments depicting his traitorous acts ended up on the cutting room floor.If the director wants to make a social commentary about the state of America's war on drugs, why include unrelated subplots?This underdevelopment extends to most of the character w/ the exception of Javier Rodriguez who miraculously betrays both Mexican cocaine cartels and the Mexican drug enforcement agency and lives to tell about it.Obviously at this point, the film has lost all elements of believability and basically unravels into a celebrity display while delivering a stern message that the war on drugs begins and ends with consumer demand.",Traffic

Traffic is an achievement from beginning to end, and shows the power that film can have.Douglas, Zeta-Jones, Del Toro, Cheadle, and the other cast members give the performances of a lifetime.  Catherine Zeta-Jones' performance is particularly riveting, a testament to her underrated abilities.  Douglas is utterly convincing as a man struck down by the irony that he is leading the war on drugs but can't even win a battle at home.  Benicio Del Toro controls the screen as a torn Mexican cop.  Don Cheadle delivers, as always.Traffic is considered by many to be three films crafted into one.  Yes, that is true, but each part indirectly depends on the other.  Soderburgh uses a different color for each of the stories, an effect that helps delineate between the separate plots.

513,lambodriver,This was perfect,10,29 January 2001,I don't say this very much but this movie was perfect. Its hard to explain but when I left the theatre I was shocked.  The movie goes on with three different stories that are all done in a different special way. You would expect that the three stories come together for some kind of final story. Well thats not the case. When the movie starts the three stories are already started and at the end of the movie none of them are finished. The feeling I got from this movie was amazing!  The camera shakes a little instead of being completely steady which starts out to be annoying but after a while you forget about it and it makes you feel like your in the movie more. There is basicly three plots but they are not in depth at all. The characters never have there moments and nothing is as you'd expect. Put all of this together and you'll notice that everything just happens and there really is no plot.  That sucks you might think. Well its perfect.  Its too hard to explain.

518,Mladen Radic,Slow and strong,8,13 March 2001,"`Traffic' is a silent rage. Slow and devastating, like a virus. Maybe we don't see that, because we expect to have fun, we just expect to spend a quiet evening and then (maybe) to go to sleep. Still, there's so much more in the movie than the gathering of stars like Douglas, Del Toro, Cheadle, Guzman, Finney, Zeta-Jones, Quaid and others. There is a story based on questions so many times asked before. But, are there any answers? Yes, there are answers  but  do you really want to hear them?The movie is not pessimistic. The story of a drug traffic that involves many sides in it doesn't even pretend to be didactical, although it may seem so. Sure, you can learn much, but director's only intention (so seems to me) is to tell a story. In a matter of fact, to tell more stories which are united around the same topic. Steven Soderbergh is very intelligent director, he can't always stand a cliché (just take a look at his `Schizopolis'), and he must do something with it. He uses yellow filter on camera for scenes that are happening in Mexico so we can almost feel the heat, and blue one for the scenes in Washington. He puts his protagonists in the close-ups so we can know them better. One last `trick' that S. uses are the roles of Steven Bauer and Miguel Ferrer. In this movie they both play drug merchants, but in the non-fiction miniseries `Drug Wars' (1990) they both played DEA agents that were fighting against drug traffic in Mexico. Oh yes, in this movie, for a change, people in Mexico do speak Spanish, all the time. When I compare `Traffic' to `Traffik' (the original British series) I can only say that Soderbergh knew what he was doing. Do you want me to explain that? Then see the `Traffik' first.`Traffic' is slow. So, if you want action, better look some other way. But if you want something that you'd remember the next day, when you wake up, this could be one of the best choices you can make.",Traffic

If there hadn't been recognizable faces of prominent actors within the movie, I might just have reached for my remote to check that I wasn't on A&E. While well-directed and acted, this didn't really seem like a movie at all. After all the hype, I felt let down. The producers of this film needed to take a page from Ron Howard's take on Apollo 13.

Yes, not since ""Titanic"" have so many words been wasted on so little.""Traffic"" manages to be self-important without being important -- the film is in fact a trivialization of subject it pretends to care about. Worst of all, the plot line of the original German-British TV series was butchered almost beyond recognition.
One of the critical elements of the series, both dramatically and in terms of the fundamental telling of the tale, was omitted entirely, and arbitrarily. Without the storyline of the opium farmer, this telling is incomplete.What is left is told without passion or commitment. The characters are detached, shallow and uninteresting. They seem nearly as bored with the movie as we are.And what can be said of Soderberg's art-school direction? Smug? Distracting? Gimmicky? He insultingly assumes we cannot distinguish one locale from another without using that laughably awful color-scheme. Well, if that's the case, it's a problem introduced by the director himself -- jiggling the camera around until the audience is claustrophobic and nauseous.Anyone who is tempted to think this a good film, let alone a great one, owes it to themselves to sit down with the original series (entitled ""Traffik"") the next time it appears on PBS.

523,rajkowski,"An entertaining film, enjoyable at face value.",7,11 February 2002,"Traffic is certainly a film a cut above the average dross and is enjoyable taken at face value as a drama/thriller. It isn't however a remarkable film, and falls down slightly by trying to be more profound than the script warrants.The film is edited in a style I enjoy (the Robert Altman mold), however the style can be used to keep interest in what could otherwise be a dull plot (like a Soap Opera), and i feel this film would be very boring in traditional format.Different camera filters are used for each of the plot threads: Bleached for Mexico; Blue for the Czar; and diffused for the dealer/court thread. I pondered why these were used and if it could signify some subtext like in the Trois Couleurs trilogy - however i can't seem to see any, and suspect it is just for atmosphere (or i dread to think, to ""colour-code"" the plot lines to keep things simple.) Much more could have been made of this element though.A minor complaint is the bulk of the story takes place during the space of a month (from the Drug Czar's induction to his first speech), resulting in some plot elements lacking a sense of proper pace e.g. Helena and The Czar's daughter's rapid transformations.One of the worst things a director can do is patronize the viewer by over explaining things and drilling points home repeatedly (one of the only things i didn't like about Magnolia). Soderbergh holds up quite well in this respect (by not falling into the obvious trap of preaching), but does end up over explaining a bit too much i.e. we have unlikely characters blurting out social commentary on various aspects of the drug war. This works very well in some instances (The Drug Czar's introductions gives Soderbergh a wonderful opportunity to present a variety of views), but looses some realism a lot of the time.The film overall is highly watchable, but lacked depth in many ways (which made a second viewing very boring). It would also have been interesting to have a strand on the source of the drugs i.e. the farming.The final scene is my favorite - understated credits, a nice score and some wonderful cinematography. The assassination scene is quite clever also.There are a good number of films tackling addiction, and Traffic holds up quite well - it pales though against others such as ""Nil By Mouth"", ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Midnight Express"", and ""Once Were Warriors"".",Traffic

The fact that the wife didnt know what her husband was was unbelievable, considering they vaguely hint that she came from the streets. The thing that got me the most was that there were no real consequences of the daughter's actions.

Of the multiple interconnecting narratives, the most effective relationship is between a father and daughter, allowing for an emotional and tense story that will be relatable to millions of parents across the world.Traffic takes no prisoners in its delivery. Soderbergh lays out the nitty gritty details of the North American drugs industry to viewers and holds back no punches in laying out the disturbing truth. Whilst doing this, the film is fantastically shot in showing harsh realities.However, with all its acting talent and engrossing storyline, Traffic falls very flat in certain places throughout the film.

530,rose_patinkin,Wonderful,8,13 March 2012,"It certainly has been a good 12 months for director Stephen Soderbergh, hasn't it? Erin Brockovich, probably the most underrated film of last year, eventually got the recognition Soderbergh, Roberts +Co deserved, as did this film, a chilling account of drug trafficking in North and Central America. As seen in 'Erin Brockovich', Soderbergh often deals with people under immense pressure, and this is quite evident here, telling the story of a new US drug control officer (Michael Douglas) whose daughter is rapidly becoming a drug addict (Erika Christensen). It also shows us the struggles of a drug trafficker's society wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whose husband is facing a conviction, and also that of a cop accused of corruption. The direction is superb throughout, speaking in tones, very believable tones, and contrasting atmospheres. The portrayal of Mexico, as a behind-the-scenes nightmare world of seediness, humidity (you can almost FEEL the heat) and as a place where one murder matters not, is handled excellently, Soderbergh quite cleverly using sepiatones to convey the mood. This high standard, which is often difficult to maintain in a movie of its length (2 ½ hours) is maintained, and while at times it borders on arty, it is done thoughtfully, incisively and effectively, the scenes of importance delivered in tense, muted tones. Javier Rodriguez's (Benicio Del Toro) character and personality is both strong and incredibly well-acted - the quiet, thick skinned yet razor-sharp mind suiting his environment perfectly, and his acting is often crucial to the moods set in the film, for example in creating the tense, unearthly atmosphere of Mexico. This quiet confidence is also a key part of one of the film's many underlying messages, namely a study in resourcefulness and where it gets us, particularly in Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, a trophy wife of a drug trafficker who is under arrest. Resourceful as she is, it takes her down the darkest and lowest moral alleyways, and this can be compared to 'Erin Brockovich', where another stressed woman used a different kind of soul and fighting spirit to get results. This film also deals with family life, and the movie cliché of 'daddy never being around' is handled exceptionally well. This time the daddy is the newly-instated drugs officer (Michael Douglas) fighting drugs on two fronts: the Mexican Border and his own home, as he struggles to keep his adolescent daughter on the straight and narrow. The characters are all strong and well acted, I can't put my finger on a single bad performance, but Benicio Del Toro is by far the best on show and his Oscar was well deserved. Michael Douglas proves again that he's a class act, as does Catherine Zeta-Jones and strength in depth is clear all round. All in all, then, a great film, combining good acting, clever psychological undertones and classy direction, which particularly stands out. Combining an ability to keep us interested with the snappy, modern style which he has brought to the movies today - this film is a gripping account and a very comprehensive display of Soderbergh's impressive arsenal of film knowledge, understanding and talent.",Traffic

533,gosia_rybak,Troublesome awareness,10,9 October 2005,"It is all true: the film structure, with three interweaving plots, the dialogs, reduced to the absolute minimum, the way the movie has been shot  all that contributes to its status of a masterpiece in cinematography. If someone says it is boring, I'd like to reply: it is so condensed with the content, that if you have enough gray cells under your skull, they will not stop working even for a second during the perception of the film.Personally, the film has overwhelmed me. It was a short peep into another world  the world of which existence it would be more convenient not to know. Not that I hadn't, before I watched the movie. Perhaps I was more absent-minded on that theme. The film's documentary-like quality made me feel, even more than think, that while I eat my meals, look after my family, sleep or work, somewhere in the world the whole death-machine runs non-stop. Some young girl with their whole life in front of her prostitutes herself for two centimeters of heroin, some driver's palms sweat when he crosses the frontier with drugs hidden in his car, someone falls out of the game with a single shot in his forehead, maybe having wetted his pants out of fear before he died. And, first of all, the money and power continues fluctuating, both between the prominent ones  the drug-businessmen, who tenderly love their children, and between the marginalized  the people who, through drugs in that or another way, get their own piece of power and control. E.g. the black people (""black"" emphasized, to stress their marginal position) successful at dealing the drugs to white students, thus getting back the sense of domination they wouldn't have been able to attain in the white-privileged society by any other means.So, even now, someone is getting stoned, maybe for the last time in his or her life. I cannot say if this consciousness is going to carry me from the sense of powerlessness to any sort of a constructive counter-action. As you are reading this, I know that you smile and say: so idealistic, naive and banal. I don't care. A single lost life is an undeniable fact that lays some weight to my shoulders. After watching ""Traffic"", try as I may, I cannot shake that weight off.",Traffic
534,marius-244-692142,Entertaining & still up-to-date,7,24 May 2015,"First of all I would like to mention that the film was produced in 2000 – 15 years ago, which makes it to me an old looking movie nowadays. While writing this I try to ignore that fact and not get into 'negative' aspects, caused by older technology or other techniques used that time. The story line has some very interesting parts and is still in the year 2015 up-to-date, if we take a look at the teenage drug problems for example. As a teenager I know there are lots of problems with drugs and I can imagine there are lots of young people, who want to try new things and explore even the more dangerous drugs (like shown in the movie). The part I cannot really relate to is the very bullheaded behaviour of Caroline (Erika Christensen) in the movie. It seems a little too much to me, but that's my personal opinion – anyways, great that people like Steven Soderbergh make the effort to show and call attention to these problems. By the way, in the movie the father of Caroline, Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is a conservative judge, who's been appointed as the US drug czar, what makes this part of the story pretty controversial and funny. Another big plus for this movie are the absolutely impressive locations. ""The film has 135 speaking parts and was shot in over 110 locations in eight different cities."" (Quote of 'Did you know' IMDb) Personally the most impressing venues for me, were the ones in Mexico – very realistic and I think there is no movie nowadays I can remember, that has more suitable or better looking locations for this kind of film. Also the color treatment fit here very well. I really appreciated the great acting performance of Benicio Del Toro as Javier Rodriguez a Mexican cop (he got an Oscar and other awards for his role) and the connections of the different plot lines. On the whole the movie was entertaining with all its action scenes (gun-warfare, sniper scene etc.), acting performances and story lines, but not my favourite movie, it got a little boring in between sometimes.",Traffic

It seemed as though it was intended as a ""serious"" film, rather than a simple profit generator, but all of its subplots seemed simultaneously obvious and silly.  I could only imagine that the director thought he was revealing some important truth about illegal drugs, or the ""war"" on them. Well, maybe if you were asleep for the last quarter of the twentieth century this movie might tell you something you don't know about the illegal drug trade, and the criminals and politicians whose livelihoods depend on it, but otherwise - I don't think so.Anyway, it isn't a documentary, so maybe it is unfair to criticize it for not being informative.  But it isn't even entertaining, despite some pretty decent acting, due to basic problems of structure and execution.  There are too many plots, necessitating too many technical events (cuts, etc.) that make the whole thing look like a soap opera.  That gimmick with the colors is embarrassingly corny, the more so because it is completely unnecessary. The only subplot that hangs together is Del Toro's; both Zeta-Jones's and Douglas's plots made me groan due to their implausibility.All in all, I give it a 4, because I am feeling generous this season.",Traffic

The camera work is particularly impressive, going well beyond simple presentation and adding much to the tone and story of the film.  And unlike some, I have no problems with the pacing, feeling that it unfolds and refolds itself in a reasonable and compelling manner.  But some elements simply didn't work with the rest of this otherwise credible film. For example, nothing in Catherine Zeta-Jones's initial performance in the film prepares you for the monumental change her character must go through later, and when that change does occur, it is simply not acceptable.  Zeta-Jones can't pull off the change, and Soderbergh doesn't help her at all.  Another issue is casting. Several major film ""stars"" fill relatively minor roles and they do so to the point of distraction. Albert Finney, Dennis Quaid and Selma Hayek all take secondary roles that should compliment the leads but instead they are out in front of the scenery, pulling focus. And Douglas's big highlight at the end -- when he walks away from the press podium - simply doesn't ring true.  It is a manufactured moment that doesn't fit the character or the plot and it really weakens what should have a much stronger ending.

Direction was solid, but as a whole the film was nothing more than a hyper-long dragged out episode of Homicide.  We've seen all these story points before.  The drug warrior's daughter on drugs who ends up the victim of the black drug dealer?  Not new.  The depiction of the kids getting high was interesting and Soderbergh did a good job of nailing that, but as a whole the movie glossed over the problems with the drug war.  And I just don't know how people can comment on the cinematography as being anything above average.  If this is how we are holding the bar for values in the cinematic field, Directors Of Photography all over the world are breathing a collective sigh of relief.",Traffic

About the only bad thing is the length of the film - it is difficult to sit in a theater for the 2:30 or so hour flick. Still, a sad and intriguing look at the problems of our ever-losing battle in the drug war.  Tons of cameos in the film including US Senators from both sides of the isle.  Benjamin Bratt does very good in a very small role. Anyone interested in the drug war should search out and find Frontline's four hour special on the drug war.",Traffic

Bravo to Mr. Soderbergh for having the courage to show that the two ""opposing"" sides are really nothing but mutually benefitting perpetrators of an indefensible fraud committed upon the minions residing in this country.

549,mark-555,A let-down of a film after hearing all the reviews in the press.,5,10 February 2001,"Well, never have I been so disappointed in a film that was acclaimed by the critics as how I felt when I sat through Traffic yesterday.  Even the ratings on this site suggest that there are a lot of viewers who enjoyed it, yet the audience I was in just sighed at the end; you could also hear them muttering on the way out of the cinema about how disappointed they were too.Basically, there are three plots going on in the film and none of them cross paths.  Michael Douglas plays the Judge, appointed to be the drug czar of America, only to find his own daughter is becoming an addict.  Catherine Zeta-Jones has a husband who becomes entangled in drugs through his business; I won't go into that plot any further.  There is also the business of the Mexican police and their clashes with a particular Mexican army general.Anyway, the camera work is very clever and good use is made of colour in the film.  It's not all viewed in hi-colour, as you will see.  It is basically used to remind you what plot you are in at any given time.However, whether the plot / story-line, call it what you will, whether this is interesting or not - and it is mildly, you still feel bored as the film moves along slowly.  Lasting over 2.5 hours, you are feeling like you want it to end after about ninety minutes.  You don't feel anything towards the characters, it's all apathy.  I couldn't have actually cared any less for them - which is why I was disinterested and bored long before the end.There are a lot of clever things in the film and about how it was made etc, but it doesn't capture you as a paying member of the audience.Trust me, you will not come out feeling excited about it, or feel entertained.You will also not want to bother to watch it again.  Then, however, it's up to you and your personal taste.  As I said, trust me.",Traffic

Another rising actor, Don Cheadle, gives an amazing performance.  The director Soderbergh does a well done job with the color filters.  He doesn't color the screen too much but does it just right.

553,chittle-3,Great movie about impact of drug use in USA,8,29 November 2000,"I saw this film at an Amazon.com pre-screen. It is really good. It's long (2.5+ hours) but I really enjoyed it. This is an anti-drug movie. It shows how drug use affects those around them, and how the war on drugs is failing. The impact of the war on drugs and its impact on their families is more far reaching than you think. It affects many, many lives. The ""two-tone"" camera work (Mexican scenes are grainy, high saturation film, where USA scenes are standard) is really neat. The all-star cast (and I mean ALL star, deep down to the bit parts) is what makes this movie. It does run a bit long and takes a while to get to the point, which I took to be that a kid using drugs today impacts everything -- and creates the cartels, drug dealers, and ruins families. Michael Douglas is pretty good as the US drug czar who's own daughter is a smack/crack/dope head, but his, as other characters, could have been developed better. The exception to this is the fantastic Benicio Del Toro, beefed up for this role, and he does shine as a the Mexican state police officer. His all-Spanish speaking role is subtitled throughout (as is all the Mexican scenes, a smart move which lends authenticity). Also well developed is Don Cheadle, who plays an American cop who loses his partner. The USA-side scene stealer is Topher Grace whom who know as ""Eric"" on ""That 70's show"" making his feature film debut. His (unintended) funny political introspective on the white American drug problem is well-written and played. He will be back on the big screen. If you saw ""Kids"" and was shocked by how ""in your face"" the acting, sex, and drug use was, this movie will rekindle those feelings. It can be very, very disturbing. This is an all-drama movie, very little ""action"" and its causes you to reflect on drug use in this country.",Traffic
554,tzimmerman,The inane nature of this awful movie shows why America has no coherent policy on Drugs,2,11 July 2001,"Only someone extremely stoned could be impressed with this tainted piece of fluff.  The plot (what little there was) was so flat and cliche as to be sleep-inducing.  The acting was mediocre, at best.  The cinematography was cliche (anyone else see ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and her Lover""?) The ""color change equals mood change"" has been done to death.As a true-blue American movie fan, I could ignore all of these flaws with ease if the movie didn't attempt to make some high-and-mighty statement that ended up leaving a very sour taste in my mouth.First, let's address the race issue, because that's the most appalling aspect of this film.  According to this movie:  Drugs are shipped here by evil unscrupulous and corrupt Mexicans, they are imported by latin-americans with dumb-but-corruptable wives, they are fought against by slightly hypocritical, but otherwise likeable aging white men, and they victimize pretty little white boys and girls who end up ruining their honor roll status.  Come on.  The height of the racial tragedy that is this movie is when the pretty little white girl's depravity is symbolized by her sleeping with the large naked black man who sells crack through the door.  The little stupid speech in the car by the kid from ""That '70s Show"" is only icing on the putrid cake that is the twisted racial message portrayed by this awful slop.Even if we could get past the racial issue, there is still the issue of socio-economic class, an issue very much tied up in America's drug woes. That issue, to say the least, is bass-ackwards in this movie.  Basically, the only people portrayed as injured are very rich people, while the people who live in the ""bad neighborhood"" are quite happy to profit off of the suburban kids' drug habits.  Let's face it, drug dealers live in bad neighborhoods because that's where their customers are.  90% of drugs go to the inner city, and stay in the inner city.Finally, the backhanded way that American foreign policy is dealt with shows how far from the truth the writer of this movie really was.  It is also offensive to believe that the only people capable of solving crime in Mexico are DEA agents.  Typically, it has been American DEA agents that contributed to all sorts of corruption in Latin America.I could go on, but this movie isn't worth any more words.  I strongly suggest avoiding this crud. If you want a ""fun and brutal"" drug movie, go watch Scarface, or even (yuck) New Jack City.  They were both better than Traffic.",Traffic

If felt that the film makers thought they were putting together some profound masterpiece, but it was all just yesterday's news.This might have been considered bold to some shut in (in the league of Rip Van Winkle, that is), but I recommend the next time you shoot for ""profound,"" then try something novel.",Traffic

Endemic police corruption in Mexico set against sea green incorruptibles (black, white and hispanic) in the States evades key issues. The need to have a feel good ending with the American family reconciled and all pulling together was trite and phoney.The performances are good and the pace is slow but deliberate and held my attention throughout, but everything was just too neat - and the epiphany and the press conference was a cliche too far.",Traffic

Anybody with a crayon and a piece of paper could have written better dialog than the trash that comes out of these character's mouths.

Maybe I am just crazy but that's a lot of people paying way too much for something that amounts to a drink coaster.Well enough about the good things in the film, I'm going to go watch Requiem For A Dream again just so I can remember what a real movie about drugs is like.",Traffic
559,timoregan144,"A balanced, artsy take on the Drug War",9,11 January 2001,"This is Steven Soderbergh's take on the Drug War and its affects on all sorts of different people. What I find amazing about this film is the objective way that he tackles it. Two people could watch it at the same time and come away with completely different opinions on the Drug War itself, along with the movie. That may be the movie's greatest strength and weakness.This film is based on the British miniseries named ""Traffik."" I haven't seen it, but that didn't detract anything from Soderbergh's epic. I found the whole thing quite fascinating and found that the movie's 2 and a half-hour running time flew by.Some people may be distracted or confused by how the 3 separate (but vaguely related) storylines switch back and forth. I found it pretty easy to keep track since the director used different kinds of film for different locations. The Tijuana storyline is shot in a bright, grainy style that almost leaves a dusty taste in your mouth. The San Diego scenes are shot in a bright, soft light that tastes like a peach. The east coast (mostly Washington) scenes are more stark, and sometimes gray and colorless. It leaves a taste of grime in your mouth. But it's expensive grime.The Washington story follows Michael Douglas' character as he is being groomed to ascend to the office of Drug Czar. To those not ""in the know"", the Drug Czar is charged with keeping illegal drugs out of the country and out of the hands of Americans, not the other way around as the title suggests. This is all made more complex by the fact that his daughter, your standard, over-achieving, straight-A student, is becoming a heroin addict. In my opinion, this is the one weak link in the film. Perhaps it's because I have some personal experience in this matter, but her downward spiral wasn't quite convincing enough for me. Douglas gives an excellent performance as a well-meaning, but distant father. Through the course of the movie we find that Douglas's character and his wife (played by Amy Irving) are having marital difficulties which are relevant to the issue at hand.Meanwhile in Mexico, a cop named Javier Rodriguez (Benicio del Toro), an underpaid and under-appreciated nark, crosses the path of General Salazar. Salazar (Tomas Milian in an excellent role) is a mysterious man out to eradicate the Obregon family's drug syndicate. He is poised to become the Mexican equivalent of the Drug Czar. Javier starts working for him, but soon becomes suspicious of Salazar's methods (this might as well be set in present day Columbia - the situations are very similar). We gradually learn that Javier is the one honest cop in all of Mexico (or so it would seem). Benicio del Toro gives an awesome performance in this flick - it could make him a big time star. Someone called him ""the soul of this film"" and I would have to agree. He's a simple man, but he's honest, and that's more than you can say for most of the rest of the characters.The third storyline deals with Catharine Zeta-Jones' character (Helena Ayala) and her shock as her husband is inexplicably arrested by federal agents. She learns he is a drug lord. But she is used to their lavish lifestyle. She grew up poor and she doesn't want her young son and unborn child to suffer the same fate. She also finds that her husband has debts which will have to be repaid with the life of her child if she can't find several million dollars. Reluctantly, but firmly, she starts taking over his business and plots to kill the stool-pigeon who is the star witness against her husband.Confused yet? Yes, it's a fairly involved story - this is not a popcorn flick. Soderbergh deals with the drug war in a serious manner befitting such a serious issue. I was able to glean his personal feelings on the issue, but I was impressed by how he doesn't let them swamp the film. Again, this is a balanced film, and it let's you go on believing whatever you want to believe about our nation's costly, ineffective and ridiculous drug war. It does, however, make it clear that the war is unwinnable. It hints that the cure may be worse than the disease.Some people have commented that certain characters tend to give lectures on the cold realities of the war, but I think this is quite realistic. I am prone to such lectures myself, but they are a function of the incredible repression (social & political) that came with the Drug War zealotry with Nancy Reagan in the 80's. Ever since then, criticizing the Drug War has been taboo, and perhaps that is why Soderbergh feels he must try to be so objective. It also explains why people, given the chance, can erupt into long rants about the injustice of the war. We've been bottling up our opinions for so long, they tend to explode when we let them seep out. That is why I am so impressed with Soderbergh's balanced and fair direction, even though the Drug War is so full of fallacy and lies and corruption and hatred and racism that it probably doesn't deserve it.But don't worry. If you think that the best way to cure addiction is to throw people in jail, take their house, car and computer, terrorize their family and ostracize them, then this movie won't completely change your mind. But it will give you something to think about. One last thing, though - if you believe that the Drug War is still winnable, this movie will destroy your fantasy world and you will be forced to concede that there is no way we will be able to keep drugs out of the hands of our fellow Americans. Ever.",Traffic
560,bigrogges,Traffic delivers a powerful message with impeccable flair.,10,9 January 2001,"Early in the year 2000, director Steven Soderbergh's film, Erin Brokovich, sizzled at the box office  (bringing in over $130 million) while receiving critical acclaim.  Now, with the release of his latest film, Traffic, Soderbergh stands to earn Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Picture for both of these movies.  It's no wonder, either, as Traffic is one of the most gripping films to hit theatres in 2000.Traffic takes on the complex issues involved with the war on drugs in the United States and Mexico from the view of these nations as a whole to the very personal level.  In the film, three  stories unfold to illustrate the near impossibility of ever stopping the drug trade, despite the billion dollars that the US spends each year for just that cause.  While the tales are related, the characters rarely, if ever, cross paths with one another. This is one of the elements that allows Soderbergh to deliver his message so effectively.The first story features Benicio Del Toro as Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.  A cop in Baja, Mexico, he enforces the law and allows the wheels to be greased from time to time.  After pulling off a huge drug bust on the Juarez drug cartel, the powerful General Salazar swoops in to confiscate all of the drugs and the credit.  Later, Javier and his partner are recruited by Salazar to fight the war on drugs by aiding him in bringing down the Obregon cartel that has plagued Tijuana for some time.Meanwhile, back in the States, Judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) of the Ohio Supreme Court is about to be appointed by the President as the nation's new leader in the drug war. For the judge, the drug war is about to become more personal than he could ever have imagined.In San Diego, Monty (Don Cheadle) and Ray (Luis Guzman) are two federal agents perpetrating a drug bust on a slimy drug supplier named Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer).  The events that follow lead them up the drug food chain to Carlos Ayala, a well-to-do suburban man who has been smuggling illegal drugs into the country from Mexico.   His arrest leaves his pregnant wife, Helena (Katherine Zeta-Jones, who was really pregnant during the film), to fend for herself while taking care of their son, court costs, and a $3 million dollar debt to the drug lords in Mexico.Traffic, written by Simon Moore (the writer for the British miniseries, Traffik, upon which this script is based), is superbly crafted and woven. We learn just enough about each character to give us some insight into their motives for the courses they choose to follow.  By the films end, matters are not neatly wrapped up; there is not a fairy tale ending.  This simply adds to the realism of the issues presented within the movie.  Furthermore, the intertwining stories drive home the fact that drugs are closer to you than you think.The script is bolstered by the phenomenal, ensemble cast.  Zeta-Jones and Del Toro have both received Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Actor in a drama for their roles in this film.  Don Cheadle is superb in his role.  Michael Douglas gives his usual performance while Erika Christensen does a good job as his daughter.  Topher Grace (of TV's That 70's Show) is excellent as her upper-class, druggie boyfriend.  Dennis Quid's character, while played adequately, is underused.The stories were shot using various filters and lenses, neatly separating them as the film went from one to another and adding to the viewing pleasure of the movie. Mexico is filmed through a hand held camera and yellow lens to give it a dry, grainy, shaky look that heightens the feel of unrest involved with Del Toro's situation.  Douglas' story is initially filmed in a hue of solemn, comforting blue.  Zeta-Jones' story is filmed without the use of lenses, suggesting that her situation and actions are the most realistic and achievable of all those presented.Despite some dialogue that spouts off statistics and seems a bit preachy, Traffic ranks among the top ten films of 2000, surpassing even Soderbergh's other venture, Erin Brokovich.  Don't be surprised if this film picks up the Oscar for Best Picture.By film's end, the message is clear and powerful. The fight against drugs is a long, uphill battle, but it is better than no battle at all.",Traffic

562,mkrotov,the best american film of 2000,10,20 January 2001,"Traffic is an incredible movie. The director, Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies and videotape, out of sight, erin brockovich, etc...) has created a film that combines elements of Hollywood and independent filmmaking. On one hand, he has created an epic that has a very wide scope and has used some famous Hollywood actors. On the other hand, as the cameraman for the film, he has shot it with a handheld camera and and makes the film visually very different from traditional films. He presents the drug war in the United States from three perspectives. The first is of a police officer (superbly played by Benicio del Toro)in Tijuana struggling with the difficult situations that such a job creates in the center of drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States. Catherine Zeta Jones plays the wife of the leader of a drug cartel in San Diego who gets arrested. Once naive about his business, she takes charge of the operations. The third story deals with the appointment of conservative Ohio Supreme Court justice Robert Wakefield, played by Michael Douglas, to the post of drug czar. This occurs while his daughter Caroline, portrayed emotionally by Erika Christensen starts descending into a world of drugs thanks to her boyfriend Seth Abrahams. (Topher Grace from ""That 70's Show"" plays Seth) These three stories are distinguishable visually. The Tijuana story is shot with different tones of yellow, giving everything that goes on in the story a feel similar to that of a hot desert. The San Diego story has warm soft colors, representing Helena Ayala's (Catherine Zeta Jones' character) once peaceful social soccer mom life. Finally, Cincinatti and Washington, D.C., the cities where the story of the drug czar takes place is shot in a cold blue, giving it an emotionless feel. Despite the importance of the visuals, what makes this film that much better is the fact that Soderbergh does not moralize. There is not an anti-drug stance but there is also not a strong advocacy of legalization. Traffic shows a problem with no current solution. The viewer has to decide for himself. 10/10",Traffic

566,adam_gascoine,Style over substance...,5,8 January 2001,"Well, I didn't like this movie at all. Here's why:The plot was remarkably weak. I did not find the stories in depth at all. In fact, I thought the movie lacked any cohesive plot, despite telling several different stories at the same time. This, I think, is where the movie fails. SPOILERS The individual plots are shallow, and where they are not shallow, they are unbelievable. I am surprised that anyone was really taken by the Catherine Zeta-Jones plot line. A young mother, who knows nothing about her husband's business, doesn't use drugs and seems righteous, careful and law abiding, ends up becoming an international drug dealer to save her husband. She has people assassinated using car bombs and handguns, she transports drugs across the Mexican border herself (drugs formed into the shape of little dolls). She manages to get the car bomb placed on a car outside a courthouse where the leading witness is testifying and there IS NO SECURITY. It's laughable. How naive is this movie? They have the witness holed up in a secluded hotel, protected by several DEA agents, and yet when they approach the courthouse they take no precautions whatsoever? It's ludicrous.Another plot line is the drug addict daughter of the leading man in the government's war on drugs. At no point is it explained why the girl is on drugs or what she is going through, the true effects of addiction. I believe at one point she states that she is ""bored"". I sympathize. There is even a scene where she is completely out of her head and having sex with a local drug dealer. She can barely see when she finds a needle in his stash. We are supposed to be shocked that she's about to move on to the hard stuff. The question is if these are the hard drugs, what was she doing to get her to sleep with a drug dealer in a dangerous neighborhood in the first place? There is no impact in that scene at all as she's already doing outrageous things for drugs. Bad movie making, sorry. If we were supposed to feel shocked at seeing her lying helpless beneath this dealer, it didn't work. I have never felt so detached from such an integral scene to a movie. It was completely emotionless. To cap this plot thread off, Douglas has a speech to accept his position as Drug Tzar. He stutters, falters, and eventually says he can't do it (after what he's been through with his daughter). Anyone who did not see this scene coming from the first scene of the movie must be blind. It was all so damned predictable.Thing is, it's very well acted. Apart from the expected good performances, Catherine Zeta-Jones puts in the best film performance of her life (that I've seen). Michael Douglas is strong as always, and Del Toro brings life to a very dull and minimal script. The camera is used well, so are filters but none of this style can cover the simple lack of substance. The film is empty, and is more a study in the director's panache than than it is a piece of entertainment. The movie needed solid, simple structure, not steady cams clever sound design. It's a mess.I have a feeling that this one will not be remembered. Despite the good reviews it is receiving, a second look at the movie will reveal all the glaring omissions and plot breakers, not to mention the lack of originality (if you're bored watching this movie, try to spot all the stolen moments from other Movies like the French Connection etc). Two and a half hours of shaking the camera and adding blue filters does not a movie make.",Traffic
567,evadstruction,Most Over Hyped Film of 2001,6,7 January 2001,"When I read the very high rating that most of the media gave ""Traffic"" I was excited to see what was obviously going to be the best film of the year. However, the first night it showed, the theatres were so full that I had to buy advance tickets for the next day. The next day I was surprised when the theatre was half-full when we seated ourselves.  Now that I've seen the film, I figure the word of mouth must already be out on this overly-long, mockumentary.Others have written that some storylines were vastly superior to others. That's a major understatement; the  Don Cheadle (Montel Gordon)and Benicio Del Toro (Javier Rodriguez)segments were the only ones that had any active acting and a storyline worth watching. Prior to the film, I read reviews about Katherine Zeta-Jones ""Oscar caliber performance,"" and my only question is, ""Who paid those people off?"" She gave a lackluster performance in a nothing role.  Michael Douglas's storyline was so insipid, and his performance so uninspired, that I halfway expected the audience to acknowledge his segments like the professor's on ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" with a resounding chant of ""Boring.""This film needs some serious editing. Based on a BBC miniseries shown on PBS, it shows like someone taped all the episodes of a miniseries and strung them together.  It is overly long, and the Michael Douglas segments were so stultifying that they incited a mass exodus for cigarette and potty breaks, refreshment runs, and cell phone conversations by the audience.
By the way, the real low point of this film was a Douglas segment where his daughter is (gasp) having sex with a black drug dealer, and I heard audible disgust from a viewing audience that had ho hummed an earlier scene where she's shot up heroin. Nothing like using racism to jolt the sensibilities.There were some good performances, most notably Cheadle, Tomas Milian as General Arturo Salazar, and  Del Toro.  However, regardless of Del Toro's standout performance, if Steven Soderbergh was hoping to achieve a gritty authenticity, he really should have used a Mexican actor because Del Toro's Puerto Rican Spanish sounded very out-of-place in Tijuana. He seemed at a loss when trying to use Mexican slang.  This also underscores a cultural insensitivity because Steven Soderbergh doesn't seem to be aware that there are differences in accents and idioms between Hispanic cultures. After all this time, there should at least be a ""token"" acknowledgement for differences in Hispanic culture in films.  For example, if a film is set in Florida, actors of Cuban descent should be used; if it's set in NYC Puerto Rican actors might be used; in California, use actors of Mexican descent. If not, at the very least, for the sake of authenticity, use a language coach.I rate films on a tier of ""big screen,"" ""video,"" and ""cable.""  I recommend this one for the ""video"" category because you can employ the fast forward button to maximise your viewing enjoyment.",Traffic

Normally, when I see movies (can be action movies, comedys or whatever) I don't ponder the message of them, or the meaning of them after the movie. Traffic just ain't one of them.It really makes you think: How naive can America's drug politics and assumptions really be? What is America (and other big countries) doing to attempt to cut down on the drugs? What are the consequences of having a drug-addict in the family?I think the main reason that it just feels so ``real'' is because they filmed it with a shaky hand-camera.. and maybe also because they made it so that when a scene is filmed in Mexico, the whole picture is like a dusty yellow screen and when they filmed in USA it's like this cold, blue, environment.

The movie takes enough time to tell the story without getting boring at any single point. The four plot lines are only loosely connected but all contribute to the broad picture, a picture so realistic, it is scary.

Traffic has none of these.Traffic is easily the poorest excuse for a film ever nominated for an Academy Award.How is it that so many have been duped by this sham movie?  It appeals to the masses because it manages, in three hours, to say nothing and offend no one.  Does anyone honestly think that a movie that has speaking cameos by both Barbara Boxer and Orrin Hatch could be saying anything controversial? Only a middle-of-the-road, fence-riding, piece of trash like Traffic could manage that.This movie is as realistic as the worst after-school special.  Not only are there better episodes of Miami Vice, I've seen more feasible plot lines in soap operas.  A rich, white girl on cocaine and heroin who manages to get all A's in a private school, be a member of six billion school clubs, and do volunteer work all while keeping everyone but her druggie friends in the dark.  A married couple has a serious (apparently ongoing) argument about their only child and a few days later both say nothing more than, ""I'm sorry,"" and then Presto! turn into SuperCouple.  A pregnant housewife who is upstanding citizen one moment and smuggling drug lord the next.  In short, this movie has not one believable plot line or character.  Not even the great Benicio del Toro could make his character powerful. If he stands out in this film it's only because everyone and everything else is so bad.  His perfomance is a diamond in a dung heap.There isn't a single line of memorable dialogue in this entire film.  The characters speak in cliches.

589,lging34,No one gets away clean....,9,23 February 2003,"In Pulp Fiction-like fashion, Traffic interlocks three different tales that focus upon the ever-increasing problem with the war on drugs.  The three stories are vastly different and, at the beginning of the film, there seems to be little connection among them.  However, Traffic weaves the stories into one dramatic tale that, by the end, depicts the realism underlying the drug trade from several viewpoints.In the first story, a Mexican policeman (Benicio Del Toro) finds himself in a web of corruption as he tries to rid Tiajuana of a controlling drug cartel.  In the second, the President's newly appointed ""drug czar"" (Michael Douglas) battles cartels on the United States' front while he simultaneously copes with his own daughter's addiction.  And in the third, two DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) in San Diego try to take down a wealthy smuggler, whose wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is suddenly forced to learn the truth behind her husband's financial success.  The tales are interrelated because they share a common, central theme--the drug trade.Steven Soderbergh, whose efforts earned him Best Director honors at the 2001 Academy Awards, blends the stories with distinct coloring styles.  The first tale is saturated in brown, effectively capturing the feel of Mexico while maintaining its cruel realism.  The second tale is distinctively washed in blue, seemingly hiding the hard reality of addiction.  The third is filmed without a coloring effect, as it reveals the difficult truth to blind eyes.
Soderbergh unites the stories in a style not too unlike that of Quentin Tarentino in Pulp Fiction.  Soderbergh focuses on each story separately, but he ultimately ties them together by the end.  Unlike Pulp Fiction, though, Traffic proceeds sequentially, whereas Tarentino's film jumped forward and back at the drop of a hat.Aside from Soderbergh's creative style, the story and acting is superb. Benicio Del Toro's portrayal of the Mexican policeman won him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and it was well-deserved.  Michael Douglas gives another great performance as the President's ""drug czar,"" coping with the effect of drugs in both his professional and personal life.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is convincing as a wealthy smuggler's wife who is sadly innocent and naive one moment, terribly ruthless and power-hungry the next.  Don Cheadle's performance as a DEA agent was, generally, overlooked when the film was released.  But, he was excellent.Traffic is certainly a film that was worth its praise.

None of the friends I watched the movie with noticed them and I don't think Soderbough had intentions to have them especially in the light of his pro African-American spiel.That said, I haven't left a movie feeling so personally affected by a movie since possibly _The_Mission_.  Even though my life has never been directly affected by drugs, the movie let me feel personally involved.

597,PKFPILE,A creation of the media,7,8 January 2001,"Traffic features excellent acting, direction, and story lines.But, somehow, Traffic falls short from being a great movie.If you have read, as I have, reviews and plot summaries of this movie, you have found them to be almost universally extravagant in their praise of this film. The critics are all awed at the powerful performance of Benicio Del Toro. Steven Soderbergh is praised for his second great film of 2000. Either Moore or Gaghan has garnered a screenplay nomination.The fact is, this movie doesn't deserve that much credit. Yes, all of the actors... ALL of them, and there are many, many, many of them due to the three convergent story lines... did a fantastic job with portraying their characters. But the script leaves little time for any of them to truly develop the characters. A perfect example of this is Zeta-Jones. Her character begins as a naive housewife to a drug lord. She is disgusted to even see her husband in court. Then, without much on-screen metamorphosis, she hires an assassin to target the lead witness against her husband. That's pretty far from naive.Del Toro's Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez is more of the same. From what I have read about the film, he is supposed to be on a one man mission to stop drug smuggling, and willing to go to extreme measures to see this done though never crossing lines. Well, the critics must have been given a Cliff's Notes of the film to peruse during their viewing, because Del Toro's character is never portrayed that clearly on film. We know through two or three lines of dialogue that he wants the kids to be able to play baseball and have the parks back. We know that he fraternizes with the enemy, but his motives there are very, very hazy, especially when he explains to US DEA agents that he feels like he has sold out by helping them. In the end we see him watching a baseball game, as if to say he's a good guy? No, it doesn't work that easily.And I haven't even touched on the story line involving Michael Douglas.In the end, let me just say this: Traffic would have made a FANTASTIC eight hour television miniseries. But there is way too much going on for what was approximately two hours and twenty minutes of cinema. The scary thing is, it's not even an editing problem, I dare say there's nothing that could have been removed. But so much more could have been added. It would have saved us the jumpy three minute segments that dominate the first forty-five minutes of the film. It would have let the exemplary cast really delve into their characters. It would have allowed the story to really hit home in a way that wasn't quite possible in this version, lest you live in an American border town, I suppose.For those of you wondering, I scored the film a seven out of ten. It's supremely acted, well directed (despite the sometimes obnoxious filtering used in all Mexico scenes), and well, if under, written. But as a moviegoer, sitting through this, I had plenty of optimism that things would continue to get better and the film would grow into the triumph that had already been proclaimed by critics nationwide.

606,supafly_311,Amazing...,10,18 January 2001,"Traffic is the Pulp Fiction of the 21st century.  In the Quentin Tarantino fashion, Director Steven Soderbergh, of ""Erin Brokovich"" and ""Out of Sight"" fame, tells multiple stories, weaving them together seamlessly into one amazing picture.  Traffic relates the tale of Robert Wakefield - the newly appointed ""Drug Czar"", or the man in charge of all American Anti-Drug related activities, his daughter, Caroline Wakefield - a former 4.0 student ranked third in her class turned drug addict, Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (yes, that's Rodriguez Rodriguez, it's not a typo) - the righteous Mexican cop that works to shut down the drug trade in Tijuana, Montel Gordon and Ray Castro - the team of American cops that provide comic relief while hunting down drug dealers in California, Helena Ayala - An everyday, common housewife whose husband  is charged with Drug trafficking, and who eventually takes control of the family business, Eduardo Ruiz - A former drug-dealer for the Ayala Syndicate turned snitch, who just happens to be the only evidence against Carlos Ayala, General Salazar - A Mexican General out to destroy one of Mexico's two major cartels, but not for the righteous reasons he presents; The list goes on and on. What makes Traffic unique, however, is not the multiple stories, but the way in which these stories are weaved together.  Soderbergh gives no single character importance over another.  All of the plots in the movie are given equal importance.  Also, none of the major characters, whether anti-drug, or pro-drug, are portrayed as ""good"" or ""bad"", they all are human, and thus at times can be a bit of both. Another major factor contributing to Traffic's success is its all-star cast.  The film features Michael Douglas (Robert Wakefield), and Catherine Zeta-Jones (Helena Ayala), it also stars several lesser-known stars like Benicio del Toro of The Usual Suspects fame (Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez), Don Cheadle from Bulworth and Out of Sight (Montel Gordon), Luis Guzmán from Magnolia (Ray Castro), Dennis Quaid from Any Given Sunday and Frequency (Arnie Metzger - a friend the Ayala family), and Topher Grace of ""That 70's Show"" (Seth Abrahams - a friend of Caroline Wakefield's).  The film also features several cameo appearances by Salma Hayek, five real senators, and the governor of Massachusetts.  The clear stars of the movie, in terms of their acting in the movie, are Cheadle and Guzmán.  The two of them are hilarious as a team of cops, and add basically the only constant comic relief throughout the movie. My favorite part of the movie though, is the small details.  The movie, evenly divided into a half set in Mexico and a half in the US, uses novel techniques to provide insight as to the settings.  When showing America, the picture is extremely bright, and very blurry, suggesting that America's feelings of superiority have served only to blind itself of the truth. When showing Mexico, however, the picture is dark, and the quality is extremely grains, thus implying the exact opposite. The sound is also innovative.  At times, the sound is deafening.  The gunshots are loud enough to make someone cover their ears.  Yet other times, there's complete silence.  You see events that should be loud.  You see people moving their lips, yet you hear nothing.  All of this serves only to heighten the immense tension. So go see Traffic.  Although it's a long.long movie, it's so interesting that you wont even notice the time pass.",Traffic

612,Faculty,"Traffic is a very assured masterpiece, which boasts superlative performances as well as oozing visual intelligence and dramatic complexity.",9,7 May 2001,"As I watch more of Soderbergh's films, Out Of Sight, Erin Brockovitch, his narrative ability goes from strength to strength. In Out Of Sight the chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and George Cloony is sustained throughout the film. On paper the plot of Erin Brockovitch is utterly predictable, yet with one or two great performances and Soderbergh at the helm the film turns out to be good entertainment. With Traffic Soderbergh merges these two aspects, sustenance and narrative, to create a very powerful and riveting attack on drugs.Soderbergh is obviously not happy with the US situation over drugs- while he admires the USA's inertia at tackling the problem he thinks that drugs should be seen as part of health care, not as part of the problem, and Steven Gaghan's brilliant screenplay realises these different aspects.
We see a domestic goddess (a pregnant and stunning Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life is turned upside down struggling to accept that her respectable husband is a cocaine importer.Michael Douglas plays a Judge Robert Wakefield who has been appointed the president's new czar- just when his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is fast becoming a drug addict.Benicio Del Toro is a weary but square Tijuana cop, Javier, on $316 a month, yet he and his partner,Manelo (Jacob Vargas), still manage to get tips on the big drug leaders - treading on a General Arturo Salazar's (Thomas Milian) toes and becoming drawn into the dangerous world of Mexican drug barons.Given the variety and focus of these stories Soderbergh could easily made a leaden film which preaches the morality of drugs to us - thank God it doesn't. The first 20 minutes opens with a take down two traffickers with their truck load of cocaine. Thrilling opening, but what really opened my eyes was the cinematography that Soderbergh  employed - overexposed burnt reds and yellows with natural light which really gave your visual cortex something to work with. Couple this with some shaky camera work (don't worry, not like the Blair Witch Project) and there is a real sense watching a powerful documentary, like the scenes shown is the real footage from a drug bust. Soderbergh's even audacious enough to have them speak in a native Spanish tongue, meaning subtitles. Never have I enjoyed seeing subtitles so much (and I've seen a few).The plight of Caroline is something which I enjoyed watching because of the ambiguity of reasons for taking drugs. She is a 16 year old girl, she was a grade A' student, yet she still chooses to take them. When Gaghan wrote this scenario (lauded for its implausibility) he was drawing from experience, what it was like at his school. Being the same age as Caroline (16) I had some fun trying to identify her reasons. Soderbergh never actually provides a reason (which is sure to infuriate some), the nearest he comes is: `I think I'm angry about a lot of stuff. I'm just not sure what.'. He leaves it up to us to fathom why `25% of high school kids take drugs' and why `in high school drugs are easier to get than alcohol'.An example of how powerfully the film makes it point is when we see Douglas searching for his daughter, after running from her support group, and when he finally does she is drugged up in a bed after having sex with a business man for drug money. She looks at him with a beatific smile, `Hi, Daddy.' `Hi, sweetheart' he says softly, and then starts to weep. The image evoked is one of a father saying good night to his young daughter, but in this scene that innocence is shattered - and that's what makes it powerful.Soderbergh also offers us an insight as to why drugs are so available, especially amongst black people. If everyday people came to your neighbourhood with money asking, `Have you got drugs? Have you got drugs?' then pretty soon people would respond to the demand. Instead of blaming it solely on black people(which is often the case) perhaps we should look at our own influence on the problem.Steven Soderbergh obviously loves his actors. Believing in the beauty of the unforeseen he even rewrote Catherine Zeta Jones' part to accommodate her pregnancy-  and it enhances the struggle of her as a mother by making her appear very vulnerable with the pregnancy. Douglas was good, although I as slightly more impressed with his role in Wonder Boys. However, while all the cast shine, the brightest star has to be Benicio Del Toro's performance as the Tijuana cop, Javier. He lights up the screen with his effortless presence, relaxed accent and he is a joy to watch, surpassing even his role in The Usual Suspects. If he doesn't receive an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor then a great injustice has been done.Accomplished as he is as a director he is also a very good cameraman. One of the advantages of being both the director of the film and the photography is that you know how to compliment them both. Partly for visual flair, partly to help us Soderbergh uses different cinematographic techniques in relation to the location; the steely, subdued blues of Douglas and Washington,the burnt yellows of Mexico and lascivious shots of Catherine Zeta Jones in San Deigo. The use of unsteady camera work serves to give an added effect of realism.The only flaw of Traffic is the slightly self-indulgent length. The penultimate 20 minutes don't quite measure up to the pace and the story goes on autopilot temporarily, promptly coming out out of it when Javier tips the DEA (for a big bust). Other than that Traffic is a very assured masterpiece, which boasts superlative performances as well as oozing visual intelligence and dramatic complexity. Recommended.",Traffic

Soderbergh gets kudos for doing a great job of interweaving three loosely connected stories. Unfortunately, each one of the stories is no better than a made-for-TV movie. The Drug-Czar (Michael Douglas) story was essentially a bad, preachy, made-for-TV movie. The U.S. drug dealer (Don Cheadle/Catherine Zeta-Jones) story was not quite as good as an average made-for-TV movie.  OK, the Mexican drug connection story was actually at the better-than-average made-for-TV standard.  The acting was nothing special, although I won't begrudge Benicio Del Toro his Oscar. Three less-than mediocre stories cannot make one great movie no matter how well the actors (only Benicio was noteworthy) act and the directors direct.

This is a movie that shouldn't be missed by anyone sixteen and over, and one that should be used by politicians to change policy, rehabilitation counselors to demonstrate the ugliness of drug use, and by society, wherein all of us need to accept responsibility for creating a stigma that prevents users from seeking treatment, and an indifferent attitude that makes it okay for drug cartels to seek a profit at the expense of people's lives.

620,thoeff,a totally American narration,5,30 January 2001,"First things first, this is not a bad movie at all. But I've seen it in many rating lists as best movie of the year, and taking that into account it has to be measured against somewhat higher standards and - at least for me - fails to come up to them.True, the movie plays with the imagery, different colors for the different locations and the overall look of the movie is not the standard Hollywood boredom we are so fed up with. But is that really all it takes to give a movie an ""independent"" movie character?The development of the characters and their decisions to change their directions would be a nice parallel, if each of the turns wasn't so stereotype. The cold-blooded politician (Michael Douglas) turning back to his family life, giving it a higher value than his career suddenly; the decorative wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who discovers her intelligence and talents to become a successful criminal; the straight cop (Benicio Del Toro), who uses his knowledge about a criminal organisation to follow his own philosophy of drug abuse prevention by getting the american police to finance a baseball stadium for kids (!). It sounds as if it could be meant ironic, but I am not so sure, that that is really Soderbergh's intention. He cannot be really serious about ""the daughter's"" (Erika Christensen) renunciation of drug's with the help of her parents and a self-help group, though. If this is not a joke, the movie is just too ridiculous.It must be noted that the performance of the actors is remarkable, especially Benicio Del Toro and Erika Christensen, who succeeds in not looking silly in a few scenes which could have easily been such (the drug taking and ""turkey"" scenes), deserve to be mentioned.Altogether a poignant narration, without the need for drastic effects, that still remains to be a totally american movie.",Traffic
621,xraymonkey71,Soderbergh's best film is a thrilling ride...,10,19 December 2000,"The film more than delivers on every level and is certainly a lock for Best Picture of the year. Soderbergh has been on an astonishing roll, demonstrating exceptional versatility in his choice of genres and tremendous agility in balancing artistry with entertainment. He's been America's most consistently brilliant and unpredictable filmmaker for the last decade, and Traffic is the culminating work of his career. First and foremost, it's a richly entertaining epic that recalls the great works of the 1970s, when directors like Robert Altman and Francis Ford Coppola engaged mass audiences with works of genuine substance. Soderbergh works on a larger canvass than he's ever done before, bouncing several characters and plot-lines against and off each other, so that images and themes rhyme and echo. Although the subject matter is drug trafficking, this is not an ""issues"" movie per se. Instead, it's a profoundly affecting dramatic thriller where the destructive forces of drugs cut across different sections of society. What's most impressive about the direction is how Soderbergh manages to avoid both sentimentalizing and moralizing about drugs. As with Erin Brockovich, there's a graceful absence of self-importance and bombast in the presentation. However, this doesn't mean the film lacks a strong point of view.Stylistically, this film represents a major breakthrough. Soderbergh shot the film himself (under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) and Traffic takes all of his past experiments with color, available light, and hand-held work light-years beyond The Limey and Out of Sight. He has created a brilliant style that could best characterized as expressionistic naturalism. His loose hand-held style lends the film an extremely spontaneous realistic tone, but the modifications of color amplify the drama. Each storyline has its own distinct look that accentuates the emotions underlining the film. (The Mexico story involving Benicio Del Toro is told in earthy saturated yellows, the story of Michael Douglas and his daughter Erika Christensen is told in an aquarium blue, while the Catherine Zeta-Jones, Luis Guzman-Don Cheadle story gets a natural available light look). In addition to being visually striking and cool in a completely unpretentious manner, Soderbergh's camera technique transcends mere virtuosity and actually becomes another character in the film. As usual with Soderbergh, the film is edited with musical verve and skill, where time is collapsed and expanded, and characters are seen reflecting on past actions.I've been remiss in not discussing the acting earlier. This film has an amazing ensemble cast where everybody is working at the top of their game. However, Benicio Del Toro definitely stands out with the breakthrough performance. I don't think it's accidental that the movie begins and ends with shots of him. He plays Javier Rodriguez, a Mexican police officer caught in a futile and corrupt system, and it's as compelling of a character as Michael Corleone. Del Toro is exceptionally relaxed and subtle, keeping his thoughts and feelings private from the other characters in the films, but sharing it with the camera. Del Toro navigates the audience through a world of impossible choices and moral corruption, quietly simmering with intense conflict just beneath the surface.  Benicio's been an indie stalwart for years, but this film should shoot his stock through the roof. If there's justice in this world, he'll be rewarded with Best Actor Awards aplenty.Michael Douglas is also terrific, adding another strong performance to his gallery of flawed men in power. He shows genuine fear and vulnerability in a harrowing scene in which he searches for his daughter in a drug dealer's den. I've never seen Erika Christensen before, but she makes an impressive debut.  Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman (they should star as a team in every movie!) are as loose, limber and spontaneous as ever, providing plenty of comic relief as well as keeping it real. Catherine Zeta-Jones takes a complete 180 from her past roles and admirably plays against her looks, appearing very pregnant while thrown into gritty surroundings. Dennis Quaid is appropriately slimy as a corrupt lawyer.Anyway, film geeks and anybody else starved for a genuine piece of filmmaking should breathe a sigh of relief and give thanks that Soderbergh has come to save the day.",Traffic

It was long, unexciting, trite... and frankly ... BORING... the acting was average at best even though it was loaded with some name brand stars ... it had no real plot and its central theme was mundane b.s... not to mention disjointed... moreover, it was more than mildly annoying in filming with video camera and color coded geography for so-called ""effect""... i.e. yellowish for mexico!! Give me a break! Heck, the Blair Witch Project made better use of this technique.. but it added nothing to this movie... IMHO.
I would urge people not to buy into the hype, and save their $7-$10 on tickets... if you are curious to see what all the fuss was about, rent it on video in a few months! You'll be happy you saved your money.

The only reason we did not walk out of the theatre was because one in our party didn't want to leave, because she had already invested 90 minutes and was determined to see the end of the debacle.In short the movie lacks everything a movie is supposed to have to make it enjoyable.  There were 2 separate plotlines that didn't really tie together, and for a movie about the war on drugs there was an awful lack of action. The Mexican plotline was hard to follow and not very interesting while and the American plotline I didn't particularly care for either because it was predictable, you knew that the daughter was going to be ok.  The acting was horrible.  I can't believe that the movie was nominated for an Academy Award.  The flickering on the screen also made my friend so sick that he had to go to the bathroom and puke.Conclusion:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen, this does not include The Lost World which I never saw because I walked out of the theatre 5 minutes into the movie, nevertheless I would have given the vote a negative rating if it was possible.

640,jorisd,A showcase of naive Americanism and cultural imperialism,5,13 March 2001,"Well I have recently watched Traffic in a sneak preview in a Dutch theatre. This particular theatre is in the habit of rating those films and Traffic scored a meagre 5.7. Let me tell you why.Although this film tries to portrait the war on drugs from a neutral and objective point of view, I do not think it succeeded at that. In fact, this film is shot from an American perspective and practises some blatant examples of cultural imperialism. For example, most of the Mexican in this film are corrupt, and when they are not they are nicely Americanised. They end sequence of traffics illustrates this. The Mexican hero has acted well, and the Americans have favoured him by setting up nice lights so Mexican kids can play baseball in the evening. This sequence suggests that when the Mexicans have adopted American culture everything will be fine.But there's more. M. Douglas' daughter does do a record-breaking slide from being a some-time user and experimenter with drugs to become a drug addicted prostitute by the end of the film (the entire time span being a few weeks). Not only does this implicitly support the theory that experimentation with drugs leads to addiction to the worst substances, the producers of this movie also thought it necessary to involve sex to make it worse. This is a highly unlike course of events. A lot of empirical evidence has been gathered against the theory described above, and the girl hardly needs to sell her body as she had just previously stolen her mother's jewellery.The last thing I would like to point out is that the reason why America is loosing the War on Drugs, as presented by this film, appears to be not enough budget and the fact that those blasted dealers blow up every key witness. Taking a harder stance against drugs is the opposite of the more relaxed and realistic policy of my country (the Netherlands). The success of this policy can be inferred from the fact that most Western European countries (including France) has copied or want to copy our policy. Last, I feel very happy and secure living in a country that cannot send me to jail over the testimony of only 1 witness.I could go on for a while but keeping an eye on the length of this piece I will only give you some more keywords.

There was no heroes, neither victims just characters living situations for the first time in their lives and doing what they can. There were a lot of remarkable quotes (you can see some of them in the quotes section) which were a reflexion call for the viewers.The editing and photograph was the best, since the director (Steven Soderbergh) used different kind of filters, lights and shadows according to the feeling he was trying to sell.

653,smilinsimon2219,One of the greatest ensembles of all time collaborate..,10,8 July 2001,"One of the greatest ensembles of all time have collaborated on one of the greatest films of all time. The acting in this is first-rate and brilliant, and if one of these actors had been left out, this movie could not have been what it was.  I was a huge Benicio Del Toro before, but this movie has sent me into obsession.  He is spectacular as a Mexican cop who is forced to make a moral dilemma.  Michael Douglas seemed right at home in his man in power role, this time the President's new drug czar, but it was refreshing to see him have emotions. It was also refreshing to see Catherine Zeta-Jones as something besides a pretty face.  She was tremendous as a San Diego wife who finds out her husband's ""true"" life. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman provided some humor and yet some serious and emotional points as well. Jacob Vargas was enjoyable as Del Toro's partner in Mexico. However, for me the real stand out in this film has got to be Erika Christensen, who plays the drug czar's (MD)addicted daughter.  She will be a force to be reckoned with.One of the best parts of this film was the cinematography, the color choices made by Soderbergh were absolutely astonishing.  The colors represent feelings about the towns involved.  The ""dustiness"" of Mexico shows us all how difficult a life it is below the border.  The ""blue"" of Cincinatti, shows how upsetting life can be with drugs in it.  While the ""normalness""of San Diego and La Jolla, show how this could be Anytown USA involved in this phenomenon. The way Soderbergh and film editor Stephen Mirrone allowed these scenes to flow was a highlight that any movie would love to have.This will one day be on the next top 100 of all time list because of it's message and sheer enjoyment.  For me this two and half hour film sped by in no time and I was sad to see it end.  The one thing this movie has that others have not, is the fact that it has America talking about a situation that needs to be discussed.  If you want to see a movie with an excellent cast, cinematography,  direction, and an important message, that isn't preached at you, this is the one that should be chosen.",Traffic

Clearly, there will be an investigation on the Federal Agent's death which would reveal that the last person the killer talked to was Catherine Zeta-Jones. 2) When the snitch actually does get killed, his security was a joke. You tell me you are going to let some guy serve him breakfast, who you don't even know who he is. People clearly wanted the snitch dead. Also, why is Don Cheadle's character protecting him? Isn't that the US Marshal's job? The snitch shot at Don Cheadle and Don Cheadle shot the snitch. So clearly they aren't going to make Don Cheadle the snitches protection. 2) At the end of the movie, Don Cheadle puts a bug underneath Catherine Zeta-Jones' table. As the movie had shown earlier, the house was already bugged. So what would that even matter. It was obvious that the bugs didn't help anything because they knew that the house was bugged. There were things throughout the entire movie that I found far fetched. I could keep going, but I would be here forever. I don't even want to start on Michael Douglas' character and his daughter.The one line of the movie that I actually liked was when the snitch was talking to Don Cheadle and told him that essentially he works for the drug lords too since all he is doing is helping the Juarez cartel.",Traffic

Traffic omits really cool segments of the drug trade that ""Traffik""(English version) covers. If you ""really"" liked Traffic, then you will like ""Traffik"" even more. Traffic DIRECTLY steals from the English predecessor. The dissolving statues. The hit with the poison in the eggs. The drug ""czar""'s daughter becoming an addict. However, the English version is VERY detailed in the descriptions of the drug manufacture and smuggling of heroine. The final episode in the English ""Traffik"" version is Epic compared to Traffic.",Traffic
672,amlindblom,It isn't as good as you might think,6,8 December 2012,"I was very disappointed with this movie. Partly this was due to the high expectations I had, but there really is a lot wrong with it. First of all, the majority of the acting is average or even below average. The exception is Benicio Del Toro's performance. He did a very good job; however, I still felt like his character could have been a little more compelling. Many of the actors seemed like they were not quite in character once filming started and I was very conscious of the fact that they were acting. Don Cheadle's character was, if not a parody, an exact copy of all of his other roles. Michael Douglas did not deliver a powerful performance as he should have under the circumstances. Then, Catherine Zeta-Jones seemed more interested in looking attractive than acting.Dennis Quaid was mostly just awkward to watch. Erika Christensen was okay, but she didn't really act much different when she was on drugs than when she was sober. So, the acting was sub-par. The acting is not the only part I did not like. The script was very boring and plain. It was even laughable at some points. You can tell it was only there to advance the plot. Lastly I felt that in many of the scenes the director insults the viewer's intelligence by over-explaining things that should be obvious. On a positive note, Del Toro did give a very good performance, and I felt that the way the 3 main plot points were orchestrated was quite good. Really the only thing that was not average, or below average, was the scope of the plot. Overall, given the material and the actors, I feel like Steven Soderbergh should have made a much better film.",Traffic
673,gogela,Breathtaking,10,16 February 2021,"I don't know what to tell you. The soundtrack is truly breathtaking, encompassing some of the best artists of the era. The cinematography, the acting, everything. This is one of the most amazing movies I've seen. I'm reviewing this in 2021.... if it came out today the result would be the same. This is one of the best movies ever made full stop.",Traffic
674,loverboy9881,This was the best movie I have seen in a long time!!!,10,14 March 2005,"This is a excellent movie for one, the director uses a problem that we still fight today. The movie deals with the Drug war we still fight to this day and, have fought for years. This war has not been able to be stopped yet so what make people think we can stop it now. So with that said the United Staets should legalize Mary-Jane to a certain extent. The way they can do this is to have a single area that you can go and smoke in peace and pleasure. They can stop an hole lot of crime by doing this. I am not by far a druggie but I hate to see the world try and fight a war they can not win. People can always get drugs they can receive drugs from the streets and/or go to the doctor and get them the drugs for a medical disorder that they do not have. The states should take my advice and work on it so they can do this to stop the crime with drugs and the death rate. I say death rate because if they do that the killings with stop and the drug war will not be as big of a war that it is today. So with that said I would be glad to see what you think about what I said, so e-mail me at loverboy9881@yahoo.com thanks and have a nice day Jonathan Fauver.",Traffic
675,lkodroff,traffic,9,5 May 2005,"The main theme of this movie was focused on drug trafficking in Mexico. However, each subplot within the movie honed in on a more specific aspect. Poor foreign relations, government corruption, and the low quality of life in Mexico were stressed throughout the film. Since independence from Spain, Mexico has struggled with many aspects of their government and economy leading to dishonest administration and widespread poverty.Historically, Mexico has been subject to problems with drugs and corruption, but compared to other countries discussed in class, like Columbia, their problems did not seem quite as horrific. After Mexico achieved independence, frequent shifts in power and profitable foreign relations made the government a lucrative profession, if manipulated correctly. This relates well to the fact that the man in charge of the national police task force, General Salazar, was also connected with in the high ranks of the Jaurez cartel. The city streets were also depicted in context with Mexican history. Besides for an extremely small elite, much of the population is impoverished. I think that the director did a good, but slightly biased, job in portraying Tijuana. Whenever the scenes that took place in Mexico were playing, it always had an overtone of horrible place to be. Although poverty and corruption my run rampant throughout the city, that was the only thing the director played up. I think, that by showing other more positive cultural aspects of the country they could have given Mexico a more objective role compared to the United States.The movie overall was excellent. The way the plots were all interconnected made it exciting to watch. The characters were all cast very well and did a good job as their parts. Benicio Del Toro did an especially good job playing Javier Rodriguez. I could tell how hard it was for him to help out in arresting General Salazar because it was made clear how the drug cartels find out absolutely everything. I also liked how all he wanted in return for his help was to fix up the baseball field and park and put lights up so the children in Tijuana could have something safe to do in the evenings. Also, I really enjoyed how it portrayed so many different sides of one topic. It gave interesting accounts on everything from personal addiction struggles to the greedy, corrupt, and harsh ways of General Salazar as the Drug Czar (the Mexican counterpart to Michael Douglas' character) to the many interconnections between Mexico and the United States involving the drug trade. The cinematography was also good. They way that most scenes were filmed in somewhat of a dim light most of the time really helped relay the somber mood of the movie.While this movie was amazing to watch for entertainment, with its dynamic characters and overlapping plots, it didn't give a realistic feel of the overall life in Mexico or serve a greater educational purpose. Therefore, I would have to give it 2 separate ratings. As a movie for the general public to watch and enjoy, I would give it a 9. But, for a Latin American History class it only deserves about a 2 or 3.",Traffic
676,fdalmolin,A very well aged film,8,21 February 2018,"I personally think that Traffic has aged really well. Firstly, that's because of the intricate and still modern plot that involves a lot of deep characters very well portrayed. Most of all, the performances of Benicio Del Toro (as Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez), Michael Douglas (as Robert Wakefield) and the debuting Erika Christensen (as Robert's daughter) were absolutely stunning. Douglas stands out with the character of the new head of DEA Wakefield who at the end resignes from his post because of several reasons. For example, his daughter ends up in an addiction from cocaine and he decides to stand by her side. He also thinks that the war against drugs can't be won, because it's an endless cycle and when you think that you finally defeated it, it is actually just getting worse.
Finally, I also appreciated the experiments with filters (blue, yellow and neutral) and light. Even if in some cases I found them a little bit too exaggerated, I think that they add drama to the story and that they help the audience distinguish the three main stories.",Traffic
677,ericou-40022,not bad,6,13 February 2018,"Traffic was an interesting movie, it had very intense scenes but also boring parts. 
I think it would have been a good movie back in the 2000s, but now it hasn't been aged so well. 
The different tones in the scenes help you know the difference in places and situations, so in one part it helped in the other part maybe the color they added was maybe too intense. However, the movie was filmed good, all the angles and the characters were also very good.",Traffic
678,surfingkiwi-51791,Outstanding film making!,10,27 February 2018,"Wow where to start?? This film absolutely dazzled me when i first saw it. Id already heard about benicio del toro who was at the time one of my favourite actors (usual suspects). Also I was a big fan of Steven Soderbergh so for me this was ideal. 
Based on a mini series on channel 4 in the UK the story centers around a judge, his daughter, and a Mexican cop. 
each strand of the story is shot in a different tint of colour. This helps keep up with the story. 
Its superbly made and deals with drugs extremely well. The scenes involving actual drug taking are sometimes hard to watch but expertly shot. Erika Christensen is an absolute revelation in this movie as the daughter. Real and you find yourself becoming sympathetic towards her character.
The star of the show though is Benicio as the cop. 
Absolute genius from start to finish, Benicio announces he is here to stay with a gigantic mesmerizing performance. 
Quick mention for Stephen Gaghan the writer whose masterful script keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish 
One of the best films i have ever seen. I highly recommend it",Traffic
