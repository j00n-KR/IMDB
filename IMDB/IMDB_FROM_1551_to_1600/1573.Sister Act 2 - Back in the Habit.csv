0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not as good as the original, but still entertaining",7,9 March 2011,"Sister Act 2:Back in the Habit is not as good as the original, but it is still entertaining compared to the disaster it could have been. It is not as well thought-out in the plot, the direction is lacking a tad, and the film does start off rather slowly.Thankfully though it does pick up, and the latter half almost equals the best parts of the original. The cinematography and production values are excellent and the script is funny and charming. Whoopi Goldberg once again has fun in her role, Maggie Smith once again is a welcome presence, the music is joyful and upbeat and the nuns are as infectious as ever.All in all, an entertaining sequel. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
1,bkoganbing,Undercover nun,6,13 March 2017,"With Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit Whoopi Goldberg is back as a faux nun who gets a request from Mother Superior Maggie Smith from the first Sister Act to go back undercover to help save a Catholic School run by the Catholic brothers headed in this case by Barnard Hughes. They need a music teacher and Whoopi's credentials were amply proved in the first Sister Act.Once again plot gambits are taken from those Bing Crosby classics that Leo McCarey did. Like in The Bells Of St. Mary's Whoopi is sent in to a failing Catholic School. Like in Going My Way she forms a really great choir from the raw material she finds in her music class. She also has to deal with a secular villain with church ties. James Coburn is hardly anything like the lovable Henry Travers as Mr. Bogardus in The Bells Of St. Mary's and has to be dealt with differently.If you bring Whoopi back you surely have to give her that lovable posse she formed from the first Sister Act. Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena and the lovable veteran Mary Wickes have all returned as well.The music is the best part of this film especially Lauryn Hill who is the centerpiece of that choir. Lauryn's scenes with Sheryl Ralph playing her mother who thinks her music aspirations are foolish are quite tender and real.The element of personal danger for Whoopi is not present in the sequel, it's lighter and at times a bit silly. Still I enjoyed it and Whoopi Goldberg's fans and many others will as well.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
2,SnoopyStyle,"good music, good young cast and Whoopi",5,28 November 2015,"Deloris van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) is headlining in her own show in Vegas. Sisters Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy), Mary Robert and Mary Lazarus attend her show. Mother Superior (Maggie Smith) had sent them to retrieve her to teach music in St. Francis High School. She agrees becoming Sister Mary Clarence once again. The school is run by Father Maurice with math teacher Father Ignatius, Latin teacher Father Thomas and the cook Father Wolfgang who only makes bratwurst. The rambunctious class includes leader Rita Watson (Lauryn Hill), brown-noser Tyler Chase, new Muslim Ahmal, white rapper Frank-Hey, graffiti artist Sketch, Margaret (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Maria (Alanna Ubach). She discovers that the school is being closed by the end of the semester.The premise makes no sense. It's obvious that this is a movie driving for a young cast and the returning characters led by Whoopi. The premise is a simple excuse to get the movie there. Once there, the music is good. The young cast has a few standouts and a couple of familiar stars in their early years. The returning actors are great. However, the story is flat and lacks any freshness.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
3,mark.waltz,"Nun of your lip, now!",4,7 May 2015,"The sisters are back, and here, they are running a school far away from the quiet San Francisco convent where they first met Dolores Van Cartier (Whoopie Goldberg). Mother Superior Maggie Smith, having lightened up towards ""Sister Mary Clarence"" in the first entry, sends her old pals Mary Wickes, Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena to Vegas to bring Dolores back, to help save her school from scheming property owner James Coburn. Like ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", they are in danger of loosing the school which may not be accredited, and Goldberg's job is to help them win financial support by getting the unenthusiastic chorus to L.A. for a choral contest. Yes, this is basically a Mickey/Judy movie, ""Let's put on a show and crush the goals of some mean adult"", only in nun's habits and catholic school uniforms. But while not as well thought out as the original, it remains entertaining and diverting.The edge is gone with the lack of a mob intrusion into the convent's life, but with many Catholic schools going under thanks to lack of funding or decreasing attendance, this was much more realistic. The subplots concerning individual students are many, from the troubled rebel who yearns for her mother's approval but doesn't go about the right way in getting it, to the talented young boy who shows he just needs some guts to bring out his true spirit, and pretty much the entire school's need to understand that these nuns are just as spirited, if more, than they are.What isn't realistic is the fact that just a year after singing for the pope, these nuns aren't recognized by the kids, and that they don't know who Dolores Van Cartier is from her previous newspaper headlines. ""Are you really a Vegas showgirl?"" one student asks incredulously. ""No, I am a headliner"", Goldberg says as only she can. The lack of continuity between the two films gives it a definite ""sitcom"" feel, but unlike most sitcoms, this one rises above mediocrity because it is just so pleasant to sit through, especially when the kids get their act together, take it on the road, and sing to the Lord, not just to win, but to show that they've grown ever since Sister Mary Clarence came into their lives.Like in the two 1960's film where she played a bus driving nun, Mary Wickes gets back in front of the wheel, and also continues the string of funny delivery with lines that with other actors would just draw blank stares. Coburn is appropriately stolid, while such popular character actors as Barnard Hughes and Michael Jeter take on priestly roles with joyous glee. The same group of Broadway supporting players are back as singing nuns, with special mention to Susan Johnson, Beth Fowler and Ruth Kobart, as full voiced on screen as they were on stage. While the original ""Sister Act"" got its own big Broadway musical, the producers of that show (including Whoopie) were wise to realize that based upon previous experiences of hit musicals attempting sequels to just quit while they were ahead. ""Sister Act II"" is great as a video entertainment, and to take it any further would be fruitless.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
4,jboothmillard,Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit,6,6 July 2005,"The first film was more original, funny and musical, but this sequel is certainly worth a look, from director Bill Duke, aka Mac in Predator. Basically Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) is back in her Las Vegas lifestyle being a more successful singer, and at her show Sisters Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy), Mary Lazarus (Mary Wickes) and Mary Robert (Wendy Makkena) come and take her to Mother Superior (Dame Maggie Smith). She asks Deloris if she would help teach music to students at the run-down parochial school, and knowing that the nuns helped her get more success, she agrees to don the habit again to become Sister Mary Clarence. At first the students are determined not to learn anything, and they also have their fun making Deloris look foolish (e.g. super glue on her chair), but they soon the school is due to be closed by local authority chief Mr. Crisp (James Coburn), so they are determined to prove they are learning. So forms a choir, and all talent breaks out, so much in fact, that they are entered into the state choir singing competition. Best singer Rita Louise Watson (young Lauryn Hill, from the Fugees) goes, despite her mother forbidding her to sing, and even with some pretty good choirs before them, and the same song as one of them, they do a fantastic performance, and deserved to win it (well, we probably knew they would anyway). Also starring Barnard Hughes as Father Maurice, Michael Jeter as Father Ignatius, Sheryl Lee Ralph as Florence Watson, Robert Pastorelli as Joey Bustamente, Thomas Gottschalk as Father Wolfgang, Brad Sullivan as Father Thomas, Alanna Ubach as Maria, Ryan Toby as Westley Glen 'Ahmal' James, Ron Johnson as Richard 'Sketch' Pinshum, young Jennifer Love Hewitt as Margaret, Devin Kamin as Frankie, Christian Fitzharris as Tyler Chase, Tanya Blount as Tanya and Mehran Marcos Sedghi as Marcos. Goldberg is very likable, Najimy still has the wild eccentricity, and even with a story that is not as engaging as the first, the musical and song sequences, such as ""Oh Happy Day"" and ""Joyful, Joyful"" keep you entertained. Good!",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
5,ccthemovieman-1,"Very Offensive, Poor Sequel",1,25 May 2007,"As with many sequels, this doesn't measure up to the original. In fact, I found this film - as opposed to the first one - very offensive. Of course, my beliefs had changed since first viewing ""Sister Act."" However, this film definitely irreverent.There are many irreverent remarks made throughout this film made by a number of people who just take the credibility of a real Believer to task. Yeah, the nuns are still ""good guys,"" but don't fool yourself: there's a lot of secular bias in this script. Nobody in here, including all the Catholics, takes Christianity with an seriousness. Hey, if Hollywood takes it as a joke, it wants everyone to do the same. That seems to be the message of this movie.Also, as in many sequels they took a part of something that worked, and then overdid it the second time. In this case, it's Kathy Nijimy's role. She was cute and bubbly in a minor role in the original, got recognized for her performance and now has much bigger part. Unfortunately, they overdid all that giggling to the point where the woman is downright annoying.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
6,ma-cortes,Likable Woopy Goldberg goes back as Sister Mary Clarence to teach music to a group of rebel students in a rundown college,6,23 June 2013,"This is an acceptable though inferior sequel to ¨Sister act¨ , a surprising box office hit ; it has a similar casting and set at an old High School which is destined for closure . The club singer Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) is again asked to don the nun's habit to help a Catholic school , presided over by Superior Mother (Maggie Smith) and formed by charming nuns (Wendy Makkenna, Kathy Najimy , Mary Wickes, among others). Friendly Deloris back and has to teach music to a bunch of students in their parochial college which is fated for closure . She creates a choir to participate in the state championship . A group of stereotypical botcher monks (Barnard Hughes , Michael Jeter) and a greedy administrator (James Coburn) attempt to detain them . However ,one of the girls (Lauryn Hill) , who is the most talented of the team , is banned to sing by her mummy (Sheryl Lee Ralph) . Los Angeles lounge singer donning nun's habit and organizing the convent choir formed by sympathetic nuns who steal best laughs and including a spectacular as well as amusing concert .This entertaining film with some genuinely funny moments follows the formula about a fish out water . Motormouth and kind Whoopi Goldberg is pretty well as the vaudeville star become unexpected nun , she is a complete show . Whoopi Goldberg was very unhappy making the first film and made this sequel only after Disney decided to finance her dream project, Sarafina! . Good performances from agreeable nuns , Wendy Makkenna , Kathy Najimy , the veteran Mary Wickes and excellent Maggie Smith who disapproves modern methods . Fine support cast , being this the first movie for Lauryn Hill, Ryan Toby and Jennifer Love Hewitt . And Whoopi Goldberg's daughter, Alex Martin, appears in this movie as one of the classroom children . The musical numbers in 'Diana Ross and the Supremes style', magical choreography and songs are catchy and done with gusto . The movie is amusing and entertaining with enjoyable set pieces but don't let it make you expect too much . Well-done musical score with swinging tunes by Marc Shaiman and Miles Goodman ; including colorful cinematography by Oliver Wood . The film is geared directly toward Whoopi Goldberg fans and young viewers . The motion picture was professionally directed by Bill Duke . Bill is a known and prestigious secondary actor , usual in villain roles as Commando (1985) and especially as one of Schwarzenegger's jungle commandos in Depredator (1987). After cutting his directorial teeth on the small screen , Duke directed his first feature film with the crime drama , ¨Rage in Harlem¨ (1991). This was followed by another impressive crime film ¨Deep cover¨ (1992), then made this comedy sequel , Sister Act 2 (1993). Duke has since continued to divide his time between appearing both in front of the camera and behind it , and remains a dynamic, stimulating and creative talent in Hollywood.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
7,moonspinner55,Desperation time...,3,29 January 2006,"Fairly desperate sequel to 1992's ""Sister Act"" has one-time lounge singer Whoopi Goldberg now a big attraction in Las Vegas, but called back to the convent by those kooky nuns to help bring order to a school full of rebellious teenagers. Poorly constructed script just begs for a lighter touch, but everything is hammered home. James Coburn looks appropriately puzzled as the proverbial villain of the piece (he wants to shut the school down, and after meeting the students, any audience may come to sympathize with him). Goldberg's mere presence brings a smile, but this is hand-me-down material (much more so than the cookie-cutter first installment) and is completely without merit. *1/2 from ****",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
8,studioAT,A joyful joyful sequel,5,8 June 2012,"Did the original Sister Act need a sequel? Probably not but the success of the first one meant that the inevitable sequel was made in 1993.And to the credit of everyone involved it's not that bad and proves and enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes. While the story isn't really that strong and the first 30 minutes are a little manic as the director tries to re-establish the characters, the story and the reason for Goldberg going back in disguise (because, let's face it, that's what audiences want to see.And so begins a film that has some good moments of comedy and music. It's not as good as the first but then again most sequels aren't. The main thing is that this film doesn't tarnish the reputation of the first and shows again that nuns can be funny.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

10,CinemaSerf,Nundercover antics...,6,18 October 2021,"The ""Reverend Mother"" (Dame Maggie Smith) seeks out the now hugely successful ""Deloris"" (Whoopi Goldberg) to help her to save a school from closure. Upon arrival, and assumption of her clerical moniker ""Sister Mary Clarence"" she discovers a disparate band of students who have little faith in themselves, each other - or their teachers. Can she lick them into shape and use their newly formed choir to save the school from the bulldozers? The premiss is not a patch on the first film, and neither is the execution. Dame Maggie offer a few classy cameo roles, as does an on form Mary Wickes with James Coburn appearing occasionally as the ferret-like administrator determined to help ensure the school does actually close, but for the most part this is akin to an early episode of ""Fame"". The kids, including an early appearance from Lauryn Hill, are almost auditioning - either to the nuns or to the audience, and even the ending is just a little like the end of ""the Sound of Music"" (only admittedly, somewhat livelier!). It's not terrible, but somehow it misses the faux-menace of the first in the series. It was made very quickly after that first one, so i wonder if this was more about capitalising on that success rather than making a quality sequel?",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
11,Calicodreamin,"Fun, but lacks novelty",6,17 August 2021,"Nothing can top the novelty of the first sister act, and it's sequel tries a bit too hard to repeat its success. Though most of the main characters return, which is always a major win. The storyline starts out shaky, but then gets into a good groove and finishes strong.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
12,view_and_review,Not a bad follow up,7,1 July 2020,"Like most sequels that try to capitalize upon the success of their original, ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"" feels rushed. Not that the movie wasn't decent (it was better than most sequels), it's just that compared to its predecessor it isn't quite what you'd hope for.So, how did they get Deloris aka Sister Mary Clarence (Whoopi Goldberg) back into a habit and back into the San Francisco convent?The local Catholic high school, St. Francis, was a failure. The staff of friar and nun teachers could not affect any kind of change in the students nor inspire them to learn. It was ""To Sir, With Love"" U.S. style (it wasn't quite as bad as ""Lean on Me"" and not nearly as bad as ""Class of 1984"" or ""The Principal""). If the nuns could convince Deloris to teach the music class, just maybe her presence would bring about an entire culture change at the school.Deloris stepped in and did what she does. She had some very talented students in her class with Rita Watson (Lauryn Hill) being the most talented.SA2 had a modernized look, feel, and vibe to it. The musical numbers were outfitted to have a 90's hip-hop and R&B sound. Some of the older numbers were performed as well, but the youngsters added their own flavor to the music they performed. SA2 was not bad as a follow up, but I'm glad they stopped at one sequel.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
13,OllieSuave-007,Pretty good Whoopi Goldberg Sequel.,7,10 March 2014,"This is a pretty good comedy starring Whoopi Goldberg as Reno lounge singer Deloris Van Cartier, who duns the habit once again when sisters Mary Patrick, Mary Robert and Mary Lazarus ask her to teach music to a group of unruly students at a Catholic School. And, to make matters worst, the school is slated for closure.Goldberg gave another comedic and strong performance as Sister Mary Clarence, and her trying to crack the whip on her rowdy music class and teach the students to take responsibility for their education and well-being are touching and an important moral for the story. And, the subplots about school chief Mr. Crisp (James Coburn) attempting to make sure the school closes so he could go onto an early comfortable retirement, and about music student Rita Wilson (Lauryn Hill) being forbidden to sing by her mother are an interesting twist to the story that are interwoven to the plot very well.I enjoyed seeing a number of songs performed by the music students, especially their take on ""Oh Happy Day"" - a catchy and stirring song. I could have live without some of the kids trying to overly act ghetto, like the Frankie character. And, it would have been great to see Jennifer ""Love"" Hewitt given more screen time and dialog, as she would go on to be a much more recognizable actor than the other student characters.Overall, not as good as the first film, but still definitely worth a watch.Grade B",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
14,ElMaruecan82,"Unoriginal, predictable and not-that funny ... a disappointing sequel ...",5,23 January 2013,"In ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"", the mother of Lauryn Hill's character, disapproves her ambition to become a singer. Was it because she didn't think much of her daughter's skills, or because she saw no future in singing for a girl of her background? Or maybe because she had the same dream at her age and it reminds her of her own failure? In fact, the only reason of the disagreement I could see is because the writer wanted to create a mother-and- daughter conflict, for an obligatory emotional pay-off at the end, when she comes to see her daughter singing and realize she didn't have the right to interfere with her dreams.There's nothing in the sequel's script that doesn't feel totally artificial. Every plot element is constructed as the upsetting set-up for an uplifting moment. Any person with a minimum of cinematic knowledge, let alone a critic, would see every scene coming a mile away. Starting with the very premise of the film: Sister Mary Clarence, back to a poor class and help students to  I don't even need to go on, did you say 'inspirational teacher', 'rude and rebellious students', isn't that one of the oldest and most predictable plots ever? Hello, ""To Sir with Love"", ""Blackboard Jungle"", hell even ""Rebellious Spirits"" two years before with Michelle Pfeiffer should have canceled out any attempt to recycle the plot for the whole 90's decade, and we'd be waiting for the French ""Chorus"" all the more conventional, but at least better done.The sin of ""Sister Act 2"" is not just to reuse a plot ""as old as the hills"" (quoting Roger Ebert) but to blatantly recycle the plot of the first film, which is to teach music to a group of outcasts in order to help them to achieve one goal. This time, it's more serious because they are all students from slums, but like the nuns, they all have the same great predispositions for singing, and naturally, the most rebellious of all (Lauryn Hill) starts defying Mary Clarence, and is therefore pushed off the group. Were we surprised that she had the most beautiful voice of all? No less or no more than the fact that all the students could sing, and the irony of their learning is that they can go away further with music rather than education.But the film isn't intelligent enough to question these considerations, and in fact, it doesn't mean much to enumerate all the clichés recycled by the film. I think ""Sister Act 2"", which is not necessarily a bad movie, could have benefited for a better script, if not plot-wise but line- wise. I mean, the main problem of the film is simply is that it's not funny, not enough anyway. The first film wasn't hilarious but it was enjoyable nonetheless, in the sequel, it's like all the elements that made the original so warm, fun and enjoyable were killed off to make us care for characters that had no originality whatsoever. Nuns? Now that was original. Misfits and outcast students with the whole 'social commentary' undertone, sure, why not, but at least try to leverage the film with a few good laughs.Even Whoopi Goldberg can hardly save the film, she doesn't even have this little spark, this wisecracking temper to provide the obligatory gags, the youngsters are so banal that they can't replace the nuns in our hearts, and the unforgettable trio of Mary Robert, Patrick and Lazarus is reduced to a simple comic relief level, which is quite frustrating. Which hooks our last hopes to music  well, the film contains enough music to be enjoyable for the amateurs of R&B, gospels and maybe rap. Personally, I don't mind music unless it serves the film not the opposite, I'm still waiting for a story, for engaging characters, for surprises, none of that happens. And what's with the overuse of rap in the background, so loud and annoying, it seemed that all the teenagers were rapping when they were supposed to talk. The whole film has a sort of video clip feeling, something that could have inspired ""High School Musical"" or ""Glee"", which is not saying much. It's a film made for the sake of it, fun and entertaining, but original, warm and funny, no? Predictable? Painfully and appallingly predictable, it belongs to the same category of useless sequels such as ""Look Who's Talking Too"" or ""City Slickers 2"", once the premise of the first film is assimilated, the only purpose of a sequel is to offer something new or something as funny, if not more. ""Sister Act 2"" failed in every category. It's not a disaster, it's not totally dull, and the teenagers play quite better than expected but are they aware that they're exploited as stereotypes of outcast students that can only go away with artistic expression.I have always thought that art could be the perfect escapism and the best way to express one's anger and frustration, but it seems so simple, so automatic in ""Sister Act 2"" that what was warm and cute in the first became a dangerous misleading caricature in the second, the same that encourage wannabe singers to exploit their background and build a legend out of an inexistent career. Coming from a poor neighborhood, learning the hard way, becomes the obligatory marketing argument to create a sort of success story. See, there is nothing in ""Sister Act 2"", that is not archetypal.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
15,ericstevenson,It's not the most horrible movie out there,5,20 June 2018,"I was surprised to find out that this only has a rating of 7% on RottenTomatoes. I admit that it's definitely bad, but not flat out horrendous. This sequel features Whoopi Goldberg becoming a teacher. The film is mostly brought down by all the clichés. We get the contest that they need to save the school. We get the outcast girl who helps them in the end. It's just nothing interesting. I will admit that it's nice to have such a charismatic person like Whoopi Goldberg back in her role. Comedy sequels are in fact rarely good. Well, I personally loved ""22 Jump Street"". The songs are also pretty good. It's just something you can skip. **",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

17,filipemanuelneto,Not as bad as the critics usually say.,5,7 February 2018,"I usually don't like to criticize a sequel before the opening movie, but I decided to make an exception because I watched the first movie years ago and intend to re-watch it as soon as I can. After revving up a nunnery in the first film, singer Deloris Van Cartier is called back by the nuns to help them to prevent the closure of a Franciscan high school by taking up the position of music teacher. The film retained much of the original cast, and it was nice to see the most charismatic and funny nuns of the first convent in a different setting. The script is absolutely predictable, and we instantly realized much of the story, but that wasn't a problem for me because it didn't prevent it from being funny and entertaining.Whoopi Goldberg is the star and she carried the film on her back to the end, with coolness and professionalism. I don't know how much she liked to do this character but the fact is that she deserved the applause and behaved like a pro. The same can be said of Maggie Smith, a notable actress who gave us the Mother Superior. Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, Mary Wickes, Barnard Hughes, Lauryn Hill and Ryan Toby also deserve the congratulations for the work they have done.""Sister Act 2"" is far from the impact and magic of the first film, and that's certainly why it has always been messed up by criticism. But we cannot go so far as to say that it's entirely bad. There are quality values here, the main one being the ability the film still possesses to entertain the audience and not make us regret having watched it. And this movie, from the moment it's a comedy, is all about being funny and entertaining. It's not supposed to be a work of art nor the movie of our lives, but just make us laugh, and if its true that it cannot get us laughing out loud, it will definitely make us smile.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

Hastily cobbled together to cash in on the success of ""Sister Act"" it presents the Hollywood Cliché afficcianadoes with a positive cornucopia. How could you not enjoy a movie that presents squeaky clean well - dressed multi - talented ""Ghetto Kids"" from every possible racial group pretending to walk the walk and talk the talk whilst meekly submitting to Music Lessons in an inner - city High School run by the Catholic Church with beaming tolerance?They perform an emasculated version of rap after doing a ludicrously polite ""Dozens"" routine that would have been laughed out of The Projects in any big city in the U.S. Just naturally the re - activated Sister Mary Clarence wins them over and blends them into a choir fit to enter the All - State Choir Competition (only in America - one hopes). Oh,and incidentally,the school is threatened with closure just to add to your pleasure. Just how it resolves itself will surprise only those who can count the number of movies they have seen on one hand. So you can safely dismiss it then?Well,actually ......no.Because ""Sister Act 2 - Back in the habit"" has some glorious musical moments.""His eye is on the sparrow"" is exquisitely sung,""Ode to Joy"" the winnning entry in the competition (oops! did I let something slip?)is accompanied by a pianist using some fantastic chord substitutions and is performed with the exhausting energy only the young and enthusisastic can summon up.

The amount of joy that radiates by seeing people who have been told they have no chance their whole lives finally being able to exist authentically is immeasurable.

It really made me feel good and smile, especially when Deloris (Whoopi Goldberg) performed her solo act at the beginning of the movie. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. The best things about it, in my opinion, are the musical number. My favorite song of the movie would have to be either ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" or the St. Francis Academy's rendition of ""Joyful, Joyful.""

22,pensman,"Singing, singing, dancing and Whoopie!",9,3 December 2017,"Of course it is a formula. It was 1993, remember 1993. It's Andy Hardy dates Sister Mary Clarence with James Coburn as a villain. And who cares? This film helps people remember how much fun Whoopi Goldberg could be and there are some wonderful music numbers that will get you moving and feeling good. Then there is possibly the best credit run ever at the film's conclusion. Plus you look at the young cast and think isn't that Jennifer Love Hewitt or Lauryn Hill? Older audiences will recognize Barnard Hughes, Mary Wickes, Michael Jeter, and Dame Maggie Smith the Dowager Countess of Grantham.There is nothing bad about just admitting you were entertained and felt good as the credits roll on. I wish Whoopi had stayed with film and Broadway. To this day I remember her one woman show on Broadway which was later broadcast as an HBO special. What a talented woman. I know it's PC to say ""person"" or ""actor,"" but I don't care; Whoopi Goldberg is a great entertainer and I can't understand why we can't accept and acknowledge she is a woman. Her performances over the years have made me cry and laugh such that I thought I would burst.Know what, just go to Apple or Amazon, rent the movie.

I just think that its cashing in on a sure thing, and its the height of laziness, and on top of everything else, 95% of them have no business existing.This one is not exactly enough to make me re-think my position, but this movie has a lot going for it and is not an offensive rip-off of the first. The story goes in a different direction and although its as obvious as the sky how it will all end up (unless you've never seen another movie in your life), I still like it very much.  I like choir singing, and the last twenty minutes contain some beautiful voices and songs.None of the actors look embarrassed to be there, which of course is a great thing, and Whoopi's effortless performance anchors the movie. Look for Jennifer Love Hewitt as a student, who is curiously absent from the dance numbers.  Brad Sullivan, Michael Jeter and Barnard Hughes are some of the comic relief, and Kathy Najimy and Maggie Smith are back as well.

It's bad all right, but not in any normal sense.  This is bad in its own unique way.Whereas the original had a sense, style, clarity and humorous thrust all its own, ""Sister Act II"" goes on a completely different tangent than the original.  It abandons the old neighborhood from the first movie, adds a bunch of characters that are introduced then forgotten, there are no references to the cop (Nunn) that helped out Whoopi in the original and aside from Sister Mary Patrick (Najimy, always good for a laugh), everyone looks bored beyond belief.The sisters are back, there's a lot of music but they had to add a bunch of sitcom kids that would have been more at home on an episode of ""Growing Pains"" or something produced by Bill Cosby.  Even with the palpable talent of Lauryn Hill, singing and acting her heart out, there is little support and little to no laughs.And Whoopi: I guess any ""Sister Act"" sequel would have to have her in it by design, but she just seems so weary by the whole idea that she wants to scrunch down into her habit and hide from everybody.I can't blame her.  And there isn't even a Witness Protection program here to help her.One good line (""We haven't the balls for that!"") does not a movie make.

The film does not quite live up to the first film, as previously mentioned, but there are a few laughs in it. This is worth seeing once if you watched the original film and enjoyed it.

This time, the groovy lounge singer/erstwhile nun Sister Mary Clarence (the same ol' Whoopi Goldberg) has to help save a failing Catholic school. Okay, so the story isn't exactly Oscar material. That's granted.Here, the real attraction is in the relationships between Deloris and the nuns, not to mention Deloris and the students. Over the course of the movie, they all discover parts of themselves they never knew they had. And, of course, one of the funniest characters in history, Sister Mary Patrick, is back, so fun is guaranteed.Some parts can feel a bit trite and even pointless, and I wouldn't go so far as to say it was better than the original, but on the whole, it deserves a much higher rating than it has now.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

32,mnpollio,Too Horrible for Words,1,23 January 2007,"I have to admit I truly enjoyed the original Sister Act. Perhaps it is my religious upbringing, but the sight of the nuns being coached by Whoopi Goldberg to integrate do-wop and Motown into their choir music never fails to tickle my funny bone. So it was with great pleasure that I looked forward to the sequel. Unfortunately, there is nary a laugh to be found. The original mined the material of watching the unlikely combination of a sassy Las Vegas wannabe singer inspire the zany cloistered nuns to irreverence. The sequel brings Goldberg back to the fold in a highly unlikely development and in place of the singing nuns we get...singing teens in another stale 'let's put on a show and save the day' scenario. Wow! How original and clever! This story was threadbare in 1930 and there is nothing funny about the kids in question. In fact, they are about as funny as an amputation. Overlooking the fact that there is literally no credible reason for the Goldberg character to leave behind being a Las Vegas headliner to help at a floundering inner city school, one could easily see some comedy being mined from Goldberg tackling the disrespectful teens. Instead, she plays straight man to a gaggle of unfunny kids. There are no classic Whoopi moments and she looks terribly bored. Also, why is she required to go ""undercover"" to teach these kids and keep her real identity from the male members of the teaching staff? It makes no sense. Nor does the fact that the world in this film seems to have undergone collective amnesia. Despite her character being on the cover of magazines and having entertained the pope in a media event, not only do none of the teens recognize her, but neither do any of the adults nor the male contingencies of the teaching staff. The film does come briefly to life when the nuns from the first film do a cameo number, but the main returnees such as Maggie Smith (I hope she was paid well), Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena are irrelevant. Even worse, when the lame-brained singing competition caps the film, you know the show is in trouble when ALL of the competitors seem better than the group you are supposed to be rooting for to win. A total mess akin to having dental surgery without Novacaine.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
33,random_avenger,Sister Act 2,4,9 January 2011,"The music-filled 1992 comedy hit Sister Act was a positive surprise both financially and quality-wise but that does not mean the inevitable sequel would be any good, of course. Directed by Bill Duke, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit tries to introduce a few new elements into the familiar premise, some of them successful, others not.Some time after the events of the first movie, Deloris Van Cartier (still played by Whoopi Goldberg) has returned to lounge singing and headlines a popular show in Las Vegas. When her old friends from the nun convent pay her a visit and ask her to help them with their work at a financially struggling high school, she cannot let them down and agrees to become the school's new music teacher. The students are unruly, the administrator Mr. Crisp (James Coburn) is uptight and the school is under risk of being closed down but luckily Deloris (a.k.a. Sister Mary Clarence) knows that the power of music is never to be underestimated.The movie starts energetically with one of Deloris' Vegas performances that catchily recounts the events of the previous movie. It is also pleasant to see that Wendy Makkena, Kathy Najimy and Maggie Smith return in the roles of Deloris' fellow nuns and that this time there are also monks present among the school's staff. Contrary to the first movie that dealt more with the other nuns, this time the comedy is for the most part based on Deloris' interaction with her new rebellious students who prefer freestyle rapping to gospel choirs. I wonder if rap music had more of a novelty value in mainstream entertainment in 1993 than it does in 2011 because seeing it now, I was left hoping for more actual songs instead of brief sessions of verbal rhyme battles and tough talking.During the latter half the music finally gets going and we hear fun songs like the funky ""Get Up Offa That Thing / Dancing in the Street"" and the final choir performances (""Joyful, Joyful"") near the end. The end credit version of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" performed by various cast members all together belongs among the most entertaining moments of the film as well. However, the movie is not really a musical and should also be judged by merits other than the soundtrack. On this front it is not very successful, in my opinion. The plot is extremely predictable, the noisy kids are annoying and the funniest characters (like the eccentric monks) are not paid enough attention. Fans of Lauryn Hill will surely be interested in her breakthrough performance as a young discouraged singer Rita Watson but I was not too big a fan of the ballads she sings here. More cheery songs like the first movie's ""Shout"" are what Sister Act 2 would have needed.Setting the plot in a school makes sure the story does not repeat the first movie's ideas too obviously but I wish they had used the different environment for something less predictable than just another tale of a new teacher cleaning up a rundown school by inspiring troubled kids to believe in themselves. I guess that if you absolutely loved the first movie, there is no reason why you would not like the sequel too (at least moderately) but generally speaking, I do not think Sister Act 2 is very good film. It seriously lacks the will to deviate from the tried and true patterns of comedy conventions and failed to make me laugh or even smile, unlike the original film that featured better songs and antagonists. You might as well save your time and watch the music clips on YouTube or something; the rest is pretty skippable.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
34,budikavlan,"A slow starter, but......",7,26 November 2001,"Different in many ways from its predecessor, Sister Act II is easy to dismiss as an inferior sequel, but such a cavalier rejection is unfair.  The original film was something of a surprise:  it put a familiar personality in an unfamiliar situation and had a lot of fun with the juxtaposition.  After watching it multiple times on video, I realized that it tailed off somewhat in the second half, as the writers struggled to resolve the thriller elements of the plot.  On the whole I still believed it to be a good film, but not a great one.  The sequel, on the other hand, seems to have been conceived from the end backward.  The second half of the plot is exciting (if familiar) and well-played.  The earlier events, setting up the finale, however, leave much to be desired.  The tough, inner-city school milieu is as tired as it sounds, and while the young actors playing the teenagers do a fine job, the characters don't take on a life of their own until the movie is over halfway done.  When the real plot of the film takes off (as the choir begins to sound like a choir), Sister Act II becomes a fun if unspectacular movie.  Whoopi Goldberg remains a familiar, comfortable yet always interesting screen presence.  The other nuns and the friars who administer the school with them are underused but entertaining.  James Coburn hams it up as the villain, but doesn't seem out of place.  The nun choir from the first film puts in a silly appearance singing ""Ball of Confusion,"" but this too doesn't dampen the proceedings.  If the filmmakers could have found a way to compress the 45 minutes or so of exposition into a shorter opening, Sister Act II would at least have been as good as the original.  As it is, it remains an underappreciated if unspectacular movie.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

You cheered every time those kids accomplished something, just as you did when the St. Catherine's Choir of the original movie became successful. A great inspiring movie about people tapping into their own potential and realize they have more to offer than they think. Both movies did a good job of getting this message across. Sister Mary Clarence didn't seem like a fish out of water like she did in the last movie, either, and that's probably why a lot of folks think this movie isn't as good as the original.

For example, The gifted student who doubts himself, the shy kid who can really sign, the white kid who acts like he from the hood, the parent who does not want his/her kid TO perform till they arrive late and see their child performing and change their mind and the run down old school they all belong too.....YAWN!!

40,lizziebeth-1,Bonus music video clip over the end credits. 7/10.,7,18 July 2002,"It's a real shame that this is such a rushed sequel to its highly successful predecessor just a year earlier, Sister Act (1992). I think this was the last time studios absolutely insisted on a quick cash-in with a formula sequel, but you can see that already there were some good intentions in this screenplay. Sister Act2- Back in the Habit is essentially a musical rework of To Sir with Love (1966), a very high pedigree story indeed. The plot is still hackneyed, probably because two groups of writers had a go at it. Sister Mary Clarence (Whoopi Goldberg) is temporarily wedged out of her Las Vegas contract for no good reason to an inner city high school, supposedly to teach music to underprivileged kids as a nun. It's ridiculous. Why did they need her, specifically? Why couldn't they use the charming Father Ignatious (Michael Jeter) instead? -no doubt because using him had been in the old, discarded version of the screenplay. On top of this ridiculous premise, the story has to survive a subplot involving an obstinate mother, Florence Watson (music diva Sheryl Lee Ralph who was so personable in The Distinguished  Gentleman (1992)) opposing the singing of Rita (Lauryn Hill), the young heroine of Sister Act2. Again, how dumb is that? No proud mother could possibly deny her own joy at seeing her beautiful daughter shine, even if it's at what supposedly killed her bozo husband. More thought should have been given to even needing this subplot. In To Sir with Love (1966), the problem was the poverty that undermined the parents' indulgence of their kids and made the parents brutish; although they still kept their sense of humour and sense of pride which then allowed Mr Thackeray to win them over. This subplot with Mrs Watson does not go anywhere deep enough to be realistic, so it feels like an afterthought, and fails. It would've been great instead to see Whoopi become a full-blown female Mr Thackeray to the kids (who are the real talents in Sister Act2), just as the charismatic Sydney Poitier had back in 1966. Thanks to music supervisor Marc Shaiman and impresario producer Scott Rudin, there is still some real quality injected into Sister Act2. The soundtrack is first rate. Make no mistake, this movie has some of the best Baptist choir music ever recorded on film, and it was pulled off by kids. Young Ryan Toby (Ahmal) absolutely slays me (this is what all performers live for) every time he hits that famous high note, in ""Oh Happy Day"". I really start sobbing. So it feels like such a betrayal when the Catholics in his audience in the movie just smile and clap politely - politeness is entirely inadequate in the presence of such talent. We're supposed to feel humility! Tanya Blount (Tanya) and Lauryn Hill (Rita) are just as evocative with their rendition of  ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"", yet Tanya claims ""...that's just for church"". Oh no it isn't, baby! So what if I'm not a Baptist? Very few people wouldn't know that Lauryn Hill was already then the lead singer of The Fugees; so I doubt these vocalists were just picked off the street by Marc Shaiman; but even if they were I would be all the more impressed. Boyz II Men were just a street corner a cappella group too, until their megahits blew America off their couches (my all-time favourite of theirs is ""It's (So) Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday"", and I was thoroughly disappointed it wasn't on the Sister Act2 soundtrack). These hugely talented young people should have had their own movie set in a more inventive plot so they could have been showcased properly. If allowed to be developed as first intended, the movie might have had the same reception as the original (and created a second possible franchise); but unfortunately Sister Act2 only had one studio purpose:- to be a sequel. Its box office slump was due to the formulaic shackles imposed by Touchstone Pictures. At least you can tell there was some real bonding between the ensemble cast. The best thing about Sister Act2 is the, haha, video clip at the end. This was the beginning of the new fashion: to include hilarious out-takes, sometimes completely invented for the purpose, under the end credits. That style has become the yardstick by which I judge movies now. In this case, the cast is choreographed into various Busby Berkeley-style overhead trick shots, and Michael Jeter is especially irresistible as he dances and runs around the camera dolly. Sister Act2 is also noteworthy for launching the careers of both Michael Jeter (Father Ignatious), and Alanna Ubach (Maria), both of whom are just a complete joy here and elsewhere. Michael Jeter has already been noticed: he was recently cast as the nervous little Frenchman with the mouse in The Green Mile (1999). Alanna Ubach is Maria, the enchanting choir student who only knows the words to ""Love Boat"". She's only been memorable in two movies that I can think of: as the smitten lesbian (very left field, but still adorable) friend of Marcia Brady in the first Brady Bunch Movie (1994), released a year after Sister Act2; and as the bravura feminist/ drama queen Jenna Marino in The Sterling Chase (1999). Hollywood needs to pick up Alanna's gauntlet because I really want to see more of her in scenery-chewing roles. Casting directors! Hello? Ding, ding, ding. So overall, Sister Act2 is a pleasant enough diversion that also delivers profound musical talent. Good fun. 7/10.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
41,spencer-w-hensley,Watchable sequel with some charm; needless to say the original was better,7,17 January 2019,"Sister Act from 1992 was a small little film that didn't look very promising from the beginning. It was originally written for Bette Midler who turned down the role, and then Whoopi Goldberg fresh off her Oscar win from Ghost took the lead role instead. Even she didn't have much hope in the small little comedy in which she plays a Reno lounge singer who is the girlfriend of a mobster, and when she witnesses a murder she is relocated to a San Francisco convent where at first she has trouble adjusting to nun's life under the guidance of Mother Superior (Maggie Smith). Along the way she befriends other nuns and eventually becomes the choir director, revitalizing the convent. But as fate would have it, the movie, became one of the biggest box office hits of its year, grossing over $200 million worldwide, and one of the most successful comedies of its era. It was charming, funny, with witty dialogue, very likeable characters and good performances all the way around. So it would only be obvious Disney, the movies distributor would want a sequel to cash in on the popular orginal's formula. This sequel picks up with Whoopi having left the convent at the end of the first movie to be a Las Vegas headline singer this time, who is immediately visited by her nun friends from the earlier film in Vegas where she performs. The chipper jolly Sister Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy), the humble Sister Mary Roberts (Wendy Makenna), and the crusty but loveable Sister Mary Lazarus (Mary Wickes) come to tell her that Mother Superior (Maggie Smith) needs her back at the convent to return as Sister Mary Clarence to teach a music class at a struggling high school. As she did initially in the first film, Whoopi is hesitant to take the assignment as her singing career is booming, but remembering her fondness for her nun friends she eventually agrees, and then it becomes a formula movie where the music class at first hates Whoopi then loves her, a greedy superior tries to shut down their school, there is a stubborn kid who eventually loves Whoopi and the choir but her hard working mom thinks it is unrealistic for her to sing and demands she quits the choir and they have a singing contest at the end of the movie, win the grand prize, the school doesn't shut down, the strict mom has now earned her daughter's respect and Whoopi as Sister Mary Clarence saves the day. Although the movie is very watchable and has some big laughs and pleasantness about it, this sequel was put in the hands of different writers and a director than its predecessor and they seem to forget about the charm, and witty dialogue and situations that made the original so much fun and popular at that. It seems that Disney was in a hurry to get a sequel out because they needed another hit on their hands so they decided to go with the old cliche plot that borrows everything from ""Lean on Me"" to ""Dead Poets Society"", because those movies had popular formulas and this sequel tries to inspire in the same way those movies did, while relying on Whoopi's charm as an actress rather than a comedienne. A lot of what is absent this time around is the interplay Whoopi had with the nuns in the previous film. Najimy who was wonderful in the first film, still gets some big laughs and so does Wickes, and Makenna as in the original has some nice and heartwarming moments, but they practically have nothing to do this time around except provide minimal support to Whoopi's students and remind Whoopi constantly of how she is the saving grace of the school. More interplay between all of them and Whoopi as well as more scenes with Smith would have made this sequel on par with its predecessor. Smith additionally has very little to do, and the first film had a lot of heart in her interplay with Whoopi, and how she eventually learned to accept her before the movie ended. The kids are talented singers and good actors, but the screenplay essentially turns them into a stereotype of early 90's kids that you were used to seeing in every other movie and show from this period, without giving them anything exciting and original to do. It was funny seeing nuns sing an alternate version of ""My Guy"" in the first film, but with the kids doing their singing schtick this time around it proves to be pretty generic. Another flaw is in James Coburn as the villian attempting to shut down the school. Coburn gives a fine performance, it's just the character is written so blandly that it's hard to appreciate him as a villian. Although not blindingly original, Harvey Keitel's villian in the first movie had some edge about him to at least make him an effective character in comparison. The sequel is not without its charm. As aforementioned there are some big laughs and moments of warmth. The real question is in mentioning the flaws it has would I recommend it? My answer would be, it depends on how much you really liked the first film. If you really enjoyed the original, which I did, you will enjoy this one for what it is while realizing it could have been better in some respects. As long as you don't expect it to be on par with the first film, you will have some laughs and fun, just realize it is very formulaic, you have seen the story a million other times before and after, expect some enjoyment and you will not be disappointed. It is good that Disney did get the hint though and not take another trip with Whoopi to the convent for a Sister Act 3. At least they knew when to stop beating the dead horse and end the story here.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

The music is amazing and they picked really great people to star in this movie for this choir. I think that this movie is better than the first movie. I think the story is better and the mucis is better. I definitely recommend this movie to people of all ages cause I think anyone at any age can appreciate this movie, it's comedy and it's messege. And I'm sure anyone who liked the first movie will definitely like this one too.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

I have not seen the first so i can't compare, but with its up-Lifting gospel tunes and funny characters, Sister Act 2 was very good. I liked the way they took old gospel songs and made them hip by adding rap vocals and urban beats.The acting is great. Whoopi Goldberg has done it again. I think she is one of the funniest people out there and her talent shows here. Kathy Najimi is funny in her supporting role and Lauren Hill should consider doing more acting because she does have talent. *** out of ****",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

I don't know why, because it is an eternal cheese-fest, but it is such a feel-good film. I love everything about it from the Whoopi Goldberg and Lauren Hill to the corny storyline. OK, so it's certainly no masterpiece, but it's also no Teenwolf 2 either. I think this is an underrated gem and deserves more than the 4.5 rating it has received. It's worth watching just to hear the amazing voices of some of the individuals involved.

It's one of the rare instances in life where a sequel is not only as good as the original, but EVEN BETTER. Lauryn Hill has a beautiful voice, and all the choir singers sounded great too.As importantly, the film comes out with a message. If you want to do something meaningful with your life, you need an education. And if you work hard and together as a group, you can accomplish anything. And of course know that Jesus loves you. This film gently mentions Jesus without shoving Him in your face. (God is a gentleman anyway.)This film is roughly 40% ""To Sir, with Love"", 30% ""Sister Act"" and 30 % ""Glee"".*****SPOILER ALERT**** Lauryn Hill's rendition of ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"" is one of the best ever.

Whatever her other pros and cons, Whoopi plays to the ensemble in this one, never the scene hog. What a pleasure to see an icon like Maggie Smith so thoroughly and obviously enjoying herself---ditto Mary Wickes, after being such a steadfast fixture of a supporting character on screen for nearly 70 years, her penultimate screen appearance.and really that's the whole point here isn't it? simple enjoyment, by actors and audience, in a meld of plots so familiar and comfortable, especially at holiday time.

Whoopi Goldberg comes to help out her friends (nuns) that are now teaching at a struggling school. She goes undercover to teach a music class and tried to turn the school around. Her main challenge is her class. It's fun, inspiring, funny, and entertaining. The only thing I don't like is the brown nosed student. His overacting is a bit annoying, but the rest of the movie is worth itIt's a great family film. My daughters love it. There is one mention of promiscuity/ sex being a topic that's covered in one of the nuns classes, but no details are given.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

Whoopi Goldberg's character Dolores agrees to go back undercover as a nun while she teaches a class with the rest of the sisters at an inner city school that is about to be closed. But of course, ""Sister Mary Clarence"" is able to whip the kids into shape and form a kick-ass choir. Although this film is not the most profound thing out there, I found it bearable. The scenes where the kids sing are really good, especially the one at the end. Overall, I'd give this film a 6 out of 10.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

I thought it was better than the 1st but I can see from reading the other comments not many people agree with me, but that's OK.  I'll just be alone in this one.  What makes it for me is the teenagers.  I love the kids in this movie.  Amual makes me crack up every time I watch it and I think Lauryn Hill is fabulous! OK so the ending is very predictable but I think would have been disappointed if they hadn't won.  Am I right?!  I love watching the ending over and over, or when Amual hits that high note for their first concert. Anyways...I don't see how people don't love this movie, it's so fun and has such a great message!  I'd much rather watch teenagers that I can relate to in the sequel than a bunch of old nuns in the 1st Sister Act but that's just me!  Guess I'm alone here!  One thing I want to say though regardless of anything is that I think every school choir should show this movie!  I'm in the choir at my school and unfortunately we have very little spirit and most people in it don't care very much.  I'm going to recommend that we show this movie to my choir teacher.  It may not help but it can't hurt.  I recommend every choir see this one just to show that a choir can dance and have fun while singing.  At least show the ending if nothing else!  Ok there's my two cents!  Everyone needs to see the movie at least for the music and to have a good time!I give this movie a 9.5/10!",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

While this film definitely took a different tone from the first ""Sister Act"", it was still and funny, yet heartwarming and had a good plot. Another super soundtrack, and another great appearance from the nuns' choir. Adding the Fathers to the mix certainly added a new element of comedy and was an essential part to the success of this movie.I loved the story, the cast, and the soundtrack--need I say more?

61,thom_kitty,Great movie... but weak subplots,9,27 December 2004,"Some people will always look at sequels and compare them to the first.. but the sequel is another chapter in the story, not a continuation of the first. The only way it is a continuation is when we pick up from the end of the first movie. I have watched several before and after Sister Act 2. The movie is still great, and love it. I have just watched it again as I am writing this. The story of her helping the school that she had went to school when she was young is well done. But there's a couple of things that I think should have be edited better. The first one is when Mary Clarence finds out about the school closing through Crisp and the Archdiocese members, discussing it between themselves over ice cream. Then when the kids learn of it later. Then nothing is done of it until the sisters learn that the school had won choir competitions and entered them in the All State in LA. How did we/they make the connection of it?The second one is the story behind Rita and her mother. The story line is stupid. Growing up, my parents didn't try to stop me for going for my dreams. But when a mother tells her daughter that she can sing or be in a choir, that woman needs a major attitude adjustment. Not every 16 or 17 year old doesn't know what they want to do. And when confronted by the teacher, she should have a heart to listen. Course, the script was written that way and the full story was there. I understand that completely. And before the editing, the story was clean. But afterward, the story will have a different meaning as well and should have had the continuity checked.",Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit
62,Mattsohot-49331,Definitely a great hilarious sequel,10,28 August 2021,I don't care what anyone says this is one of the best movie sequels of all time. The first one was great also. I really love how both of the Sister Act movies are musical/comedy movies. A lot of parts in both movies had me rolling laughing. The whole entire cast totally fitted their roles like Champs especially the kid actors and actresses like Lauryn Hill and Jennifer Love Hewitt. They all did a terrific job. I also loved how in this movie Lauryn Hill's character Rita towards the end of the movie went to the singing competition against her own mother's wishes. That took a lot of bravery and courage for Rita to follow her heart. If I were in a situation like that I would have done the exact same thing. Another part that I love in this movie is how the one boy let out a loud whistle register during the kid's first choir performance. There's a lot of people and singers that can't do that. Heck I admit that I have a pretty good singing voice and I honestly can't even do that whistle register. That part gives me goosebumps every time I watch this movie. I don't understand why people don't like this movie and the first one. I mean they're both musical comedy movies what do you haters from this kind of movie expect a revival of a horror movie like Jaws? Unreal. I highly recommend this movie to those who haven't seen it as well as the first one.,Sister Act 2 - Back in the Habit

The acting is fantastic, the cast are phenomenal (particularly Ms Lauryn Hill and Whoopi Goldberg), it has some wonderfully hilarious scenes and characters, the music is incredible, but what's lovely is the overall message of the film. It's about community, individuality, not giving up, struggle, passion, understanding, relationships, coping, and how by working together, getting a little help from friends, and establishing commonality, can have an incredibly positive impact on someone, others, and the world around them. For me it's a tearjerker in the end, empowering, uplifting, but fantastically funny too. I rewatch this movie sporadically and I am so happy it exists.

If you are one of the reviewers with less than kind things to say about this movie, then you definitely missed the point! Whoopi Goldberg is an entertainment dynamo with so many talents, it boggles the mind! Combine her with Maggie Smith, Kathy Najimy and you have many laughs and a great on screen chemistry. This movie should be in everyone's family library (along with the first installment) for sheer entertainment value! A resounding 10!! As a public school music teacher, this movie speaks volumes to the heart. Students need to hear a message of hope and possibilities, whether it be a center city high school filled with rebellion, or a rural America elementary school. This cast and crew has put together an entertaining, thought provoking musical frolic!! I use this as an end of the year teaching tool as I send students on to bigger and better things in life.

Both bring back lots of great memories of when I directed a Spanish choir at my church when I was in high school (gosh) twenty years ago.The music is fun, and yes the plot can be a little sappy at times. Definitely predictable. But at the end of a rough day when a little inspirational feel-good movie is needed, just can't go wrong with this little gem.One thing though, after skimming through the comments posted here on this movie: the actors don't seem all that bored.

This is a feel good movie. Funny, entertaining, heartwarming, with songs I still find myself singing to this day after seeing it almost 25 years ago.I imagine all these reviewers have no idea what it's like to be a student in rough neighborhood or a teacher trying to relate and teach those students. I not only spent my childhood going to a catholic school in the South Bronx but my father also taught there as a music teacher.The effort he put in, really trying to gain their respect and believe in these students when they felt like no one else did, like their lives and fates were sealed, so why even try, changed my life and perspective and this film always reminds me of those times. So many scenes and situations are exactly like the things he'd do.So if you think this is just Hollywood or Disney nonsense, you're wrong. Sure it's uplifting and it has a fairy tale type ending, and it glosses over the hard at times violent realties but sometimes it not a bad thing to be positive.My dad took his kids to perform at Madison square Garden and other places no one ever believed they'd go, but he believed and they were awesome.So I genuinely do not understand the hate.

My friend and I watched the movie tonight for the first time in years only to realize once again why we love it so much. The kids in the movie not only add to the singing but also add a more updated touch. Much better than the original movie this one has just as many moments that make your hair stand on end. I could on and on about the many good qualities of the film. From the music to the acting, the jokes, and not to mention some cute guys and girls to look at too :). It was also nice to have the reoccurring roles of many of the previous nuns coming back. The fact that it had a much larger cast of bigger names such as Lauren Hill and Michael Jeter not to mention the return of the amazing Kathy Najimi as Sister Mary Patrick. The movie contains much of the humor of the original while giving it a new hip-hop beat. This movie will forever be in the eyes of me and many others one of the greatest Whoopi movies ever.

That was all I had to say but gotta make 10 lines so: Pros of Sister Act 2 1: Completely predictable ; You won't risk hurting your think-bone. 2: You can use the time to contemplate what exactly Ted Danson was thinking when he decided to get with Whoopi. 3: It will show you everything you'll be missing when you go to one of those ""good"" movies.

Now I'm going to ask you a question or series of questions and I want you to answer honestly. Did you or did you not a) tap your foot b) clap your hands c) sing along or d) get up, dance, and belt the music with Lauryn and/or Ryan Toby? Because if you chose any of the above (but especially [d]), you'd understand that's what this movie was made for. There are some movies that are not created to challenge the viewer cinematically.

Less church music than the first one, more modern hip hop stuff on this one. Probably not one for the children though. In good humor, there isn't any swearing on it, one of the few these days and I did catch it today on the Disney Channel so it was all good and recommended for children.

However, Sister Act 2 is a different kettle of fish, in spite of the return of a few known characters. I can seriously relate to it, and so can people working with kinds, teens and 'tweens' , in schools, inner city urban situations. I like a movie where people of no hope end up with hope. Found myself wipe off a few tears at the end. And in life almost imitating art. I was asked to help out as choir director for a bunch of kids and teens that were being taken care off by our local Salvation Army. They, you guess it decided to form a choir. They were kids from different,sometimes dysfunctional and even broken homes, with a few suffering from ADHD !
