0,MartinHafer,This represents pretty much everything I hate in films.,2,19 August 2021,"Some people loved ""Charlie's Angels"" and they have a right to enjoy an action picture like this. I didn't like it in the least..and I have that right. After all, it's all about personal taste and what I hated, others liked.For me, the problem with ""Charlie's Angels"" is that the film seems like it was designed for kids with ADD, as there were no quiet times during the film...just one stunt after another after another after another. The plot seemed there to serve the stunts instead of the other way around. Just watching the first five minutes really showed me all I wanted to know about the film. It was brash, loud and featured stunts that make those in the ""Mission: Impossible"" movies seems mundane and believable. For me, I wanted stories...characters who weren't caricatures and something to challenge me. Too many slo-mo scenes, too much loud music and just...well...too much! The only thing that challenged me about this one was my patience and I can't believe I actually finished it. Yes, that's how much I disliked the film.",Charlie's Angels
1,TheLittleSongbird,Enjoyable movie that is also a little silly,6,8 February 2009,"This movie is not a favourite, but it is entertaining. It is a bit loud in places, and the script has its ups and downs. The film is about three women who try to find a kidnapped computer boffin, and the prime suspect is a man named roger Corwin. It turns out that the kidnapping was a set up, to kill their boss, so it's up to the girls to stop him. The music does get a bit much, but it is common in films like these. The stunts were actually better than in most Jean Claude Van Damme movies. On the acting front, the acting is a mixed bag. Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore were great fun as the girls, while Bill Murray gives great comic relief as Bosley. Sam Rockwell isn't really up to my liking, but you would disagree. Tim Curry has been better, but in a small role, he was good too, as were Crispin Glover and Kelly Lynch. Worth watching, but avoid the sequel! 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",Charlie's Angels
2,Leofwine_draca,Worst of the worst,1,9 September 2018,"It's difficult to describe in words just how awful this big screen adaptation of CHARLIE'S ANGELS is; a gurning, self-aware, self-important film which you get the impression is supposed to be cute and funny. It's really not. I only watched this due to the presence of a Hong Kong screen stalwart (Yuen Woo-ping's brother, no less) doing the action choreography, but it's all slow motion, sub-par wirework which copies THE MATRIX and looks absolutely ridiculous. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu are quite possibly the worst actresses it would have been possible to choose as the crime-fighting trio, and I spent the whole time cringing with embarrassment at their juvenile antics. Even poor old Bill Murray can do nothing but look embarrassed at being around. Next time I try to think of one of the worst Hollywood blockbusters I've seen, CHARLIE'S ANGELS will be at the top of the list.",Charlie's Angels
3,SnoopyStyle,McG tries too hard for High Octane fun,6,2 June 2014,"Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz), Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore), and Alex Munday (Lucy Liu) are three girls recruited to work for the mysterious Charlie. Natalie is geeky brain with the body. Dylan is the rough and tumble rebel. Alex is the rich girl with ambition. Bill Murray is the new Bosley. Chad (Tom Green) is Dylan's weird boyfriend. Jason Gibbons (Matt LeBlanc) is Alex's clueless actor boyfriend. They have a new case to find kidnapped tech entrepreneur Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell). They are hired by Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch) and Roger Corwin (Tim Curry) is the lead suspect.McG doesn't waste anytime and tries to push this high octane reboot of the campy 70s TV show. It's action, skimpy outfits, and more action. Bill Murray does his Murrayest best but it's obvious McG didn't write him much of anything. Then there is the oddball Tom Green. No matter how hard they try, they're unable to bring the comedy to this movie. The best thing about this is Cameron Diaz. It's always great to have her shake her assets in her underwear. And the girl can surely kick. At least, she goes all out dancing a storm with a smile. Drew and Lucy doesn't have Cameron's energy but who does? Crispin Glover plays a great villain. Overall it's a lot of flash but it's not quite as funny as it wants to be. It's not as fun or exciting as it should be. It's McG overload.",Charlie's Angels
4,gavin6942,Entertaining Fluff,6,13 September 2017,"Three women, detectives with a mysterious boss, retrieve stolen voice-ID software, using martial arts, tech skills and sex appeal.This is not a good movie, but it is a fun, fluffy popcorn movie. The cast is incredible, the soundtrack top notch. I cannot even imagine the budget on this thing. And the inclusion of Bill Murray? That was inspiring.And then there is Tom Green. Now, I actually like Green in small doses. But he is the odd man out here. The character of ""the Chad"" just seems wrong on so many levels. He disrupts the flow of the comedy and the gratuitous outfit changes. (Oddly, despite the obvious attempt to push the ""sex appeal"" angle, I feel like this film probably has more female than male fans.)",Charlie's Angels
5,lee_eisenberg,Charlie does surf!,7,21 July 2006,"OK, so it's just eye candy, mostly appealing to horny teenage boys, but the ""Charlie's Angels"" movie is pretty neat. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu reprise the roles of the 1970s crime-fighting babes. This was one of the only movies based on a TV show to get it right (a far cry from ""The Flintstones"", ""I Spy"" and ""Bewitched""). Maybe it was Bill Murray's neat characterization of Bosley, but this is definitely a movie worth seeing - although I heard that the sequel was one of the worst movies ever made.Anyway, you're sure to enjoy this movie. It's more proof of the talents of all involved. Also starring Sam Rockwell, Kelly Lynch, Tim Curry, Crispin Glover, Luke Wilson, John Forsythe, Matt LeBlanc, Tom Green and LL Cool J.",Charlie's Angels
6,jboothmillard,Charlie's Angels,3,11 July 2005,"I had seen the odd bit of this, and knew the three leading actresses, so I suppose it was necessary to see the film based on the popular 70's TV show in full, from director McG (Joseph McGinty Nichol). Basically a mysterious guy named Charles Townsend, or just Charlie (who we only hear the voice of, by Dynasty's John Forsythe) runs a private investigation company, and he has three female agents working for him, Natalie Cook (gorgeous Cameron Diaz), Dylan Sanders (the beautiful Drew Barrymore, also producing the film) and Alex Munday (stunning Lucy Liu). Their mission, with a little help from their boss John Bosley (Bill Murray), is to find stolen voice-recognition software, created by Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), owner of Knox Technologies. The big suspect is Roger Corwin (Tim Curry), and they also keep coming face to face with the Thin Man (Back to the Future's Crispin Glover). Also starring Kelly Lynch as Vivian Wood, Luke Wilson as Pete Komisky, Matt LeBlanc as Jason Gibbons, Road Trip's Tom Green as Chad and LL Cool J as Mr. Jones. The fight scenes can be stupid and too much similar to The Matrix, the special effects don't help much, the story has hardly real point, and the only good reasons to see this film are for the good giggly support by Murray, and the titillation by three beauties, but that's it. Adequate!",Charlie's Angels
7,ccthemovieman-1,Eye Candy No-Brainer Fun To Watch,7,29 March 2007,"This is a stylish and entertaining action film, albeit a stupid one mentality-wise. However, there are a lot of movies in that category, so you just put your brain on ""hold"" and enjoy the ludicrous story. Here, it's three gorgeous babes kicking the tar out of everyone.....which IS ridiculous! The story may be lame but the visuals are a real treat, and I don't mean just the girls, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu. The colors in this movie are vivid and fun to view.The story is cartoon-like in nature and and funny in a number of sots. If you took this story seriously, you'd be insulted. The only warning I would give is for smaller kids because there are a lot of sexual innuendos in here along with a number of closeup shots of cleavage and butts. (Not that I am complaining!)",Charlie's Angels
8,Tweekums,Good cheesy fun,7,13 November 2016,"Based on the '70s TV show of the same name this film follows the adventures of three beautiful secret agents; Natalie, Dylan and Alex. They work for a mysterious man, who they have never met, called Charlie who gives them their instructions over the telephone when he calls his assistant John Bosley. After a prologue which sees the Angels deal with a bomber on a plane the story proper begins. There assignment is to rescue Eric Knox, a kidnapped software engineer, and retrieve the state of the art voice recognition program he created. Chief suspect is Roger Corwin; the head of a rival company whose communications satellites could spy on anybody if combined with Knox's program. They manage to rescue Knox and break into Corwin's company only to learn that things aren't as they seem. They are soon in great danger as is the secretive Charlie.If you are looking for something vaguely believable then this isn't the film for you; it is cheesy and everybody involved is clearly aware of that. If you want to spend an hour and a half watching brain-in-neutral silliness you could do a lot worse. The story is pretty solid; it is just the execution that is deliberately silly. Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu are a lot of fun as Dylan, Natalie and Alex respectively and Bill Murray is on good form as Bosley. There is a good amount of action, nothing too violent but exciting enough. The special effects aren't very special but that isn't too much of a problem given that it isn't meant to be taken seriously even the plane in the opening shot doesn't look real giving us a hint that what follows will be silly or just poor I'm sure plenty of people will find it poor but I rather enjoyed it. Overall good silly fun if you are in the right mood.",Charlie's Angels
9,BA_Harrison,Switch off your brain and relax.,7,20 July 2014,"When Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), head of a successful software company, is kidnapped, Charlie and his 'angels', Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu), are hired to rescue the missing man, unaware that they are merely pawns in a complex revenge plot.No matter how dumb this big-screen adaptation of the '70s TV series gets (and it gets REALLY dumb in places), I find it hard to hate too much on any film that steadfastly refuses to take itself seriously, exploits every opportunity to squeeze its babelicious trio of stars into sexy attire, delivers several truly ridiculous action scenes, and features Crispin Glover as a creepy kung-fu kicking villain with a unique way of smoking a cigarette.Some of the silliness can start to grate (yes, Tom Green, I'm talking about you!), but the gratuitous eye-candy and excessive scenes of mayhem more than make up for any cringe-worthy moments, best bits being the OTT opening that quickly establishes the 'anything goes' comic-book tone, Crispin Glover's alleyway brawl with the girls, Diaz dancing in her pants, and the sexy trio dressed as German milkmaids (patting each others' heinies to an Oompah tune).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Charlie's Angels
10,moonspinner55,"High-spirited, infectious ridiculousness",6,26 June 2005,"Head-spinning collage of technically marvelous effects in theatrical remake of cult late-'70s TV series. Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Lui are attractive, funny, resourceful, sexy and--most importantly (and surprisingly) quite convincing as super-detectives. Their case (involving rival software companies, a kidnapping, and the planned assassination of boss Charlie) doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and Bill Murray is out-of-it as confidante Bosley, but director McG's modern-comic action is so lightning-fast and silky smooth you may be having too much fun to notice. Some of the satire is actually rather smart, and the girls are game for just about anything. **1/2 from ****",Charlie's Angels
11,blanche-2,an atrocity played out before my eyes,2,13 May 2001,"Thinking I would be entertained, I mistakenly watched this film - and I use the term ""film"" loosely. It's not a film. It's a bad music video filled with obvious and cheap process shots, lots of blue screen stuff, slow motion signifying nothing, no plot, no background as to the characters or their relationship or who any of them are, no characterizations, no acting, not even a discernible era. Cameron Diaz wakes up after dreaming about doing a disco number - and that's as close to getting a time period on this film as it gets. All, of course, set to music!I can't believe this cost $92 million to make because it looks incredibly cheap. Lucy Liu needs to stop having plastic surgery - her face is nearly paralyzed. The only people who showed personality (though neither had any character definition in the script) were Bill Murray and Drew Barrymore.I'm still in shock. This is not even good camp like ""Valley of the Dolls"".After this and that disaster TV show ""Titans,"" I think Aaron Spelling needs to hang it up.",Charlie's Angels
12,Quinoa1984,"Oh yeah, a real winner",3,6 November 2000,"When I say that statement, please understand the sarcasm in it makes Dennis Miller look like George Washington.  Because, this film is a waste of time, in anyway you look at it.  The story (if worth following) has three girls (Diaz, Barrymore and Liu) who ditzy around in a case that even if you never saw the show know the plot.  A bad film on many levels, and isn't failed over here because of Barrymore's constant charm and sexuality and Bill Murray has a couple of laughs (but even he, the Veinkman, can't redeem anything here).  Even the action seems fabricated in a way that isn't even trying to be OK, but MTV violence.  D",Charlie's Angels
13,wes-connors,Consenting Angels,4,25 January 2009,"Originals ""Sabrina Duncan"", ""Jill Munroe"", and ""Kelly Garrett"" are not seen, nor are subsequent graduates ""Kris Munroe"", ""Tiffany Welles"", and ""Julie Rogers"". ""Charlie"" (John Forsythe) is still running the Townsend agency, and ""Bosley"" is played by Bill Murray. The new angels are: ""Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel"" Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz), ""Angel of the Morning"" Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore), and ""Undercover Angel"" Alex Munday (Lucy Liu). Those songs introduce the angels; and, the production is filled with music video-type songs.Ms. Diaz's bootylicious dancing proves baby has back. Ms. Barrymore's wide open shirt will push your PG-13 buttons. And, Ms. Liu's dominatrix scenes are to die for. The three as singing Swiss Maids (if that's what they are you'll know the scene) are wet dreamy. Mr. Murray's ""Bosley"" lacks the innocent fey-amongst-hotness manner which make David Doyle's portrayal so successful. The new angels are fine, but their screenplay is flat.**** Charlie's Angels (2000) McG ~ Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu",Charlie's Angels
14,BandSAboutMovies,Fun,4,6 April 2020,"Remember when McG was a thing?The director of Charlie's Angels began his show biz career by producing Sugar Ray's first album, co-writing their earworm song ""Fly"" on their second and directing videos and documentaries for Smash Mouth, The Offspring and Korn. This led to ads and finally, to this remake of the 1970's TV series, moving it a more spy-friendly direction.After Terminator Salvation, We Are Marshall, the Chuck TV series and several abortive attempts to direct bigger studio films, he has seemed to settle into directing Netflix films like Rim of the World and The Sitter.But man, for a while, he was the toast of the town.This movie combines everything late 90's into one tidy little time capsule for you. Cameron Diaz, producer Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu are the Angels for this generation, not jiggling and definitely more aware of their sex appeal. They work for Bosley - Bill Murray, who famously treated Liu like offal to the point that she physically attacked him - and the always unseen Charlie (voiced by John Forsythe, just like the series).For that matter, McG has always claimed that Murray beat him up on the set. I'm sure he had his reasons.The Angels' mission? Find and rescue a software genius (Sam Rockwell) from an evil communication magnate (Tim Curry). Along the way, they encounter a hair-sniffing lunatic that continually gets the best of them in fights. As played by Crispin Glover, this movie represents the actor's return to the mainstream while remaining a complete maniac, which is always appreciated. After all, he was supposed to have speaking parts, but Glover refused to voice them, wanting his character to be even more mysterious.Of course, Rockwell is really evil and tries to kill the Angels and Charlie, who he blames for killing his father in Vietnam. And oh yeah - Tom Green, Matt LeBlanc and Luke Wilson all show up as boyfriends.The real heroine of the film? Barrymore, who bought the movie rights to the show and pocketed $40 million on this movie and $80 million on the sequel. Seeing as how she had to read through thirty versions of the script, I'd say it was all worth it in the end.",Charlie's Angels
15,michaelRokeefe,Ravishing and lethal detectives rescue stolen software.,6,8 June 2001,"This is a clever big-screen adaption of the popular '70s TV series. A trio of martial arts trained detectives with drop dead gorgeous looks work exclusively for an unseen boss 'Charlie' Townsend(John Forsythe). The angels are played by Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu. With the sometimes inept help of Charlie's assistant Bosley(Bill Murray), the striking detectives investigate a kidnapping and retrieve some highly technical software that could lead to the death of their boss.Also in the cast of this fun, run and gun romp are:Tim Curry, Matt LeBlanc, Kelly Lynch and a very impressive villain played by Crispin Glover. If you have yet to fall in love with Miss Diaz, you deserve no mercy. She proves again to be charming, sexy and very talented. Miss Barrymore also has that way of being funny while not losing an ounce of sex appeal.Although contrived and a bit silly this movie is an action filled escape.

Along with their helper Bosley, the Angels are sent into action when electronics genius Eric Knox is kidnapped, with the nefarious Roger Corwin as the prime suspect. But they soon learn even bigger danger is afoot -- the kidnappers have gotten their hands on Knox's latest invention, a system that can monitor voice communication from anywhere in the world, virtually ending the notion of private conversation.This entertaining confection possesses the substance of the TV show, the pacing of a Hong Kong action movie and the production values of a James Bond thriller.Also,it was a good view for people who love action and entertainment.There is nothing more it except that.",Charlie's Angels

18,preppy-3,"Sexist, stupid and boring",4,15 November 2000,"Wow!  What a load of c**p!  I didn't think it was possible, but this movie is even worse than the TV show!  The plot is beyond stupid--to be totally honest I can't really remember it.  Anyways, it's just an excuse to have Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz get into VERY tight outfits and prance around.  I'm really surprised this film got a PG--there's so much flesh shown on these girls!  It goes VERY close to an R more than once. Also the jokes are very stupid--one of them has Liu being a lousy cook!  I thought that stereotype disappeared in the '50s!  As for the acting--Lynch is very good in her role; Bill Murray looks miserable; Barrymore looks confused; Liu can't act; Matt LeBlanc (as Liu's boyfriend) is basically playing Joey from ""Friends"" and Tom Green is REALLY annoying as Barrymore's boyfriend.  Only Cameron Diaz gives out a good performance--she's so lively and fun.  Also Luke Wilson is very good as her boyfriend.  Those two have great chemistry together.  So, I gave the film a 4 only for Diaz, Wilson and some good fight scenes.  Otherwise, this is a mess.",Charlie's Angels
19,zardoz-13,A Marvelously-Lensed Matriarchal Melodrama!,8,24 September 2008,"Surprisingly, ""Charlie's Angels"" stacks up as the best big-screen adaptation of a vintage TV show since the Harrison Ford ""Fugitive"" in 1993! This top-flight but formulaic feminist empowerment fantasy about three gender-bending babes clones surefire elements from the ""Mission Impossible"" movies, the James Bond franchise, martial arts actioneers like ""Romeo Must Die,"" and the kitschy, self-depreciating humor of the ""Austin Powers"" escapades. Cameron Diaz of ""Any Given Sunday,"" Drew Barrymore of ""Never Been Kissed,"" and Lucy Lui of ""Shanghai Noon"" generate genuine camaraderie as the three newest heavenly bodies: Natalie, Dylan, and Alex. They constitute a heroic trio of resilient, gorgeous-looking, crime-busters with their high-kicking, gravity defying ""Matrix"" inspired derring-do and their beguiling feminine wiles. As the solitary hold-over from the ABC-TV series, John Forsythe returns as the voice of Charlie. ""Ghostbusters"" Bill Murray replaces David Doyle as the avuncular Bosley and adds solid comic support while providing somebody for the Angels to rescue.Predictably, while women dominate men in this marvelously-lensed matriarchal melodrama, they still respond to their secondary domestic roles as obedient daughters currying favor for an off-screen father figure. Clocking in at a Spartan 92-minutes, this ballistically charged, tongue-in-cheek, high-tech cutting edge, cleavage fest gives the old ""Charlie's Angels"" TV show a commemorative, larger-than-life make-over, preserving its traditional strengths and pumping up its action quotient. Written by ""Tapeheads"" scenarist Ryan Rowe, ""Bill & Ted"" scenarist Ed Solomon, and ""Go"" scenarist John August, ""Charlie's Angels"" recaptures the essence of its small-screen predecessor with its nostalgic opening credits but embellishes the formula with kinetic, high velocity, action sequences.Principally, the story focuses on these aggressive Angels taking the fight to their enemies rather than luxuriating in romance as passive participants. Sure, romantic interludes figure in the plot, but these staples of the television show take a backseat to the stunning action sequences that overshadow the Angels in their peripheral roles as girlfriends. As usual, anonymous millionaire Charles Townsend contacts Bosley by computer and over a voice box briefs sweetly naïve Natalie (Cameron Diaz), tomboyish ringleader Dylan (Drew Barrymore), and exotic tech-pert Alex (Lucy Lui) about their latest assignment. Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch of ""The Desperate Hours"") has hired these elite private eyes to rescue her recently kidnapped business partner, a young Bill Gate electronics wizard named Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell of ""Galaxy Quest"") who has created a revolutionary voice-identification computer software package which could replace fingerprinting.Initially, our heroines compile clues that lead them to suspect wealthy satellite network honcho Roger Corwin (Tim Curry of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"") and his silent, sword-wielding henchman (Crispin Glover of ""River's Edge"") as the masterminds behind Knox's abduction. Happily, nothing appears quite as simple as it seems. Not only do our heroines find themselves hurtling through one flaming hoop after another to save their derrieres, but they also must thwart a vengeful villain from killing Charlie.What ""Charlie's Angels"" lacks in narrative originality, former music video helmer Joseph McGinty Mitchell, billed as 'McG,' compensates for with audacious, over-the-top, high-octane histrionics. McG pares the plot down to basic essentials, but he never misses an opportunity for a delicious digression as when he introduces the Angels, showing Natalie in her braces giving her driving instructor a fit of anxiety about her erratic skills as a motorist.McG aligns our sympathies with the heroines at the outset and make the cunning adversaries as despicable as possible. Crispin Glover with his saber spouting cane and lean, mean Kelly Lynch make memorable villains who pose a clear and present challenge to our heroines. Not only does ""Charlie's Angels"" maintain a full-head of steam throughout its preposterous maneuvers, McG keeps these butt-kicking Barbies in the thick of the gunfire and explosions. Alex's quick thinking and agile physique enable her to survive a deadly ambush in her boyfriend's bullet-riddled trailer that appears as a refreshing variation of a similar episode in ""Lethal Weapon 2"" when a helicopter strafed Mel Gibson's mobile home.Although they shun conventional firearms, these statuesque dolls demonstrate incredible kung-fu skills which would make Jackie Chan and Jet Li flinch. ""Charlie's Angels"" appropriates the latex masks from ""Mission Impossible,"" but has the good sense not to overuse them in an entertaining introductory aerial episode. Although they depict nail-biting melodramatics, McG and his scenarists know when to let off steam with humor.If you're counting, at least four self-mocking hair flips occur, occasionally in slow-motion, along with advice from Dylan and Alex to Natalie to flip her hair to attract a love-stuck bartender. Five songs featuring Angels in both titles and lyrics can be heard, including ""Undercover Angel"" and ""Angel of the Morning."" Ten references are made to wiggling booties, while only a couple of shots of cleavage show up.Despite its dazzling state-of-the-art computer graphics, McG's vigorous, energetic directing, and an above-average cast, ""Charlie's Angels"" owes its success as a top-notch cliffhanger comedy to spunky Cameron Diaz's blinding, mega-wattage smile, sassy Drew Barrymore's cleavage, and Lucy Lui's cute eyes and squeaky leather outfits.",Charlie's Angels
20,Calicodreamin,Solid fun,8,6 November 2019,"While this is certainly not an Oscar winner, it's always been a low key favorite of mine. The acting is comparable, the action is a bit far fetched but fun, and it's got funny moments. I enjoy the chemistry between the angels and I think their personalities are perfect for each actor. The plot is well developed and there's a good flow to the movie. I think some of the effects don't work, too much showing off in the fx department. But thoroughly enjoyable.",Charlie's Angels
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Stupid beyond belief,6,6 November 2004,"Another (Hollywood) remake of something that was popular... I haven't seen the original TV-series, but I tend to believe that it's a hell of a lot better than this. Despite huge star power and sex appeal, the film fails on pretty much every level. The action is dull and powerfully overdone. The plot is ridiculous... 30 script rewrites, and that's what they end up at? Jesus... the acting is good enough, I suppose, but for so many big names in the comedy genre I expect to actually laugh during the movie. The movie spends a lot of time referencing far better movies. The special effects are decent. Too much of the film is ripping off better movies... the slow-motion bullet effect is an obvious rip-off of the much better effect presented in The Matrix. The film is predictable and barely makes sense. The plot has multiple gaping holes. The only worthwhile thing in this movie(don't bitch about me saying this, I'm a guy, and the director is obviously as well), I'm sorry to say, is the sex appeal of the three main characters/actors. There are plenty of scenes that are really alluring and it's hard to completely hate the movie, due to that. The movie is silly, corny and cheesy, but if that's your thing, you might enjoy it. Otherwise, avoid like the plague... unless you're a straight (preferably teen) guy. Decent for a single watch and then forgetting, if you don't actually have to pay for it. 6/10",Charlie's Angels
22,gridoon2021,Fluff,5,24 July 2009,"Okay, the original ""Charlie's Angels"" TV series was (from the few episodes I've seen, I plan to see more) no great shakes in artistic terms, but it had a pleasant lightweight tone - this big-screen transfer is too jokey and self-conscious. The way the heroines can fall from great heights or be blown away by bombs and emerge with barely a scratch, you'd think it was all based on a cartoon series or something. The action is uneven - there are a few very good scenes (Cameron Diaz defending herself against an assassin in a public restroom), but too much obvious wirework and ""Matrix""-like gimmicks elsewhere, which make the film look dated already. It's a shame, really, because Cameron Diaz clearly worked hard to get into top shape for this role, and we already know Lucy Liu can pull off a fight scene. The sexiest woman in the movie is, IMO, Kelly Lynch (amazing body); in fact, all of the villainous characters (Sam Rockwell, Crispin Glover) are more interesting than the generally unfunny supporting good guys (Tom Green, Matt LeBlanc, and yes I would have to include Bill Murray in this list). It's a film that has its moments, but could have been a lot better. ** out of 4.",Charlie's Angels
23,Uriah43,Wasn't Half As Good As the Original Series,3,14 May 2014,"Although the critics loved this film and showered it with a ton of awards I have to say that this was probably one of the worst movies based on a television series I have ever seen. The action scenes were awful and the humor was practically non-existent. Not only that but if you're going to do a remake of Charlie's Angels then it's really important to understand what made this show so successful in the first place. To that end let me just say that it was no accident or mere coincidence that Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson were easily the most beautiful team of females to grace the television screen back in the mid-to-late 70's. Call it chauvinistic or politically incorrect but what made this show so special was the fact that they were all gorgeous. And back then everyone knew this. That said, realizing the effectiveness of this simple formula, whenever one of these lovely ladies left the series the producers always ensured that they found other incredibly attractive women to take their place (Cheryl Ladd, Shelley Hack and Tanya Roberts). In that regard I thought that both Lucy Liu (as ""Alex Munday"") and Cameron Diaz (""Natalie Cook"") were adequate selections. But quite frankly, Drew Barrymore (""Dylan Sanders"") has no business being one of Charlie's Angels. She simply doesn't have what it takes. As a matter of fact, Kelly Lynch (as ""Vivian Wood"") would have been a better candidate than her. To make matters even worse, I thought Bill Murray totally botched the role as ""John Bosley"". He was awful. At any rate, to sum it all up this movie wasn't half as good as the original series and I have rated it accordingly. Below average.",Charlie's Angels
24,anaconda-40658,No Angels Here.,2,25 December 2015,"Charlie's Angels (2000): Dir: McG / Cast: Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, Bill Murray, Sam Rockwell: Generates for the very purpose of showcasing three women seducing their way to victory. They are not given personalities. They are simply Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu throwing their feet about. Diaz meets the mailman at the door in her Spider-Man underwear. Barrymore strokes her tongue on someone's steering wheel. Liu swings a mean stick as she addresses a classroom full of males. Charlie is heard but not seen as he instructs the Angels on a mission. Title suggests that these women are not timid. The plot is numerous martial arts scenes that bare nothing to the original show. McG films it like a music video, but one wonders whether he actually remembers anything from the original show because this is a total farce. Barrymore fights off opposition while tied to a chair. Diaz engages in combat while talking on a cell phone. Bill Murray is cast as Bosley their mentor and while there are hints of comic flair, it is obvious that the role is pure cardboard. Sam Rockwell plays the villain whose role is about as enticing as a kick to the family jewels. Its feminist view seems to encourage retaliation against male society. In return, the male society should retaliate against this stupid film by burning every copy in existence. Score: 2 / 10",Charlie's Angels

26,zetes,*SPOILERS* People were begging me never to see this movie...,7,6 June 2001,"But I did anyway. And those people were wrong. Charlie's Angels, while not showing up at any awards ceremony (although the people who run those might be wrong, too), is quite a good action flick. In fact, I don't often like action movies, but this one turned out to be special.I'll go through a few cons first before I get to what I did like: the script is the biggest problem of the film. The action sequences almost always work, if not for the adrenaline rush then for the giddiness of them. It is the exposition that hardly ever works. The introductory vignettes give the film an immediate sour flavor, and, for a long time, the movie heads downhill. Don't worry, though. As soon as the next action scene starts, you'll forget about anything excessively crappy that came before. The humor of the script often worked, but not always. They went a bit too far with the tongue-in-cheek shtick. Wink wink nudge nudge. The only technical thing I can complain about is the constant desire to Matrixify the action sequences. I despised the Matrix, and I'll quickly tell you why: it is NOTHING but an action flick with a script no deeper than Charlie's Angels YET it believed that it was speaking grand profundities. What's worse, audiences bought the pseudo-philosophic mumbo jumbo it was spitting out. As for that film's action, the first slo-mo scene is neat, but it is used so poorly throughout the rest of the film that it renders itself ineffective YET people still ate it up. Films that The Matrix influenced have sort of made better use of the technique, but, really, you can only go so far with it. Charlie's Angles does some pretty neat stuff with it. The bullet scene in Charlie's Angels, stolen directly from The Matrix, is put to decent use here, showing us the truth of a situation where in regular speed the truth would have escaped the audience (as it does the characters).Pros: well, the action, dummy. This film has some of the most beautiful action sequences this side of Die Hard.Also, something that is never noticed with action movies, usually because they are so schlocky, but Charlie's Angels has some of the most beautiful cinematography I've seen in recent years. And that's not just because the frames enclose beautiful women or scenery. The DP and director know how to use the camera, especially how to move it. There is a long, unbroken shot in Knox's apartment that is truly awesome. A cinematography award would not be out of place here. It's techniques are often innovative, too, even if it does also steal a lot. The scene where Drew Barrymore gets shot out the window is amazing in the way it rewinds the scene to show us what actually happened. The use of split screen is also good. It is not new, perhaps, but I haven't seen it done in this way. I hope the director, credited as McG, directs even better action films in the future. All he needs is a great script and, bam, you may just have an action masterpiece, something that is rarer than the dodo.One actor has to be singled out, and it is not one of the angels: Crispin Glover. He's always been sort of an odd fellow in his films, but it was impossible to predict him as a James Bond's-adversary's-main-henchman type, sort of like Jaws from Moonraker. He says not a word, but he's just so good at what he does in this movie. It would be kind of sad if he were from now on terminally type cast as that character, but I'd love to see him in another similar role.As for the Angels themselves, well,  they are gorgeous. I'm not a Drew Barrymore fan, usually, but she's pretty hot here. Lucy Liu is also good, and Cameron Diaz is a goddess.",Charlie's Angels
27,JamesHitchcock,Film-making without Due Care and Attention,3,17 October 2007,"The original ""Charlie's Angels"", which ran between 1976 and 1981, was a highly successful TV series, but nobody at the time thought to make a big-screen version of the adventures of Jaclyn, Farrah and Kate or their later successors. And with good reason. The original format was deliberately constructed to fit American television's one-hour-minus-commercial-breaks timeslots and could not easily be extended to the two hours of the average cinema feature. In recent years, however, Hollywood's dearth of original concepts for new films has led it to turn to old television shows as a source of new ideas.The ""Angels"" of the title are three young women who work for a private detective agency. Every episode of the TV series used to begin with the three sitting on a sofa and being given their instructions by their boss, Charlie. Charlie never appeared in the series and the angels never got to meet him; instead he communicated with them by a speaker (presumably connected to a radio link). The Angels' adventures were all crime-fighting or espionage-related exploits, told in a light-hearted style reminiscent of the Bond films. Although the series showed women as strong and capable, it was sometimes criticised by feminists for concentrating too much on its heroines' physical charms and for an occasionally patronising tone, such as the way in which the voice-over which accompanied the opening credits always referred to the women as ""three little girls"".The film version keeps the same basic idea. The three Angels in this version are called Dylan, Natalie and Alex. One morning Charlie gives them their instructions on their latest case, the kidnapping of a software expert, presumably by a business rival. They quickly manage to trace the kidnapped man and free him, only to find that they have got involved in a scheme to murder Charlie himself.That, at least, is the basic plot. It actually gets a lot more complicated than that, but plot is not something the film takes seriously. Come to that, it's difficult to say exactly what the film does take seriously. It is never sure whether it wants to send up the original series or to celebrate it. At first it looks as though it is being satirical, replacing the original voice-over with a more feminist-friendly one about how the ""three little girls"" grew up into women, but any intention of satirising seventies sexism is soon shelved.Shelved, but not replaced with anything tangible. The plot is generally either implausible or incomprehensible. Characterisation is negligible; the three Angels seem to have interchangeable personalities and the villains are all completely colourless. At first I thought that Tim Curry's arrogant, overbearing tycoon would prove to be the exception, but it turns out that he is not the real enemy. The heavily stylised fight and action sequences are unconvincing; if the oddly-named director McG thought he could achieve a similar balletic effect to that found in Chinese martial arts films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", he was sadly mistaken. All the film has to fall back upon is the physical charms of its three heroines, and while these are considerable (Lucy Liu looks particularly lovely), glamour alone is never enough to ensure the success of any film (except perhaps softcore porn).The film aims at being light-hearted but ends up as simply lightweight, the sort of brain-dead popcorn blockbuster put together without any real thought. For me two things stand out as symbols of this slapdash approach. The role of Alex was originally written with Angelina Jolie in mind; when Lucy Liu was drafted in at the last minute, the scriptwriters neglected to change the character's Anglo-Saxon surname (Munday) to something more suitably Oriental. An important plot-point hangs upon Natalie's ornithological skills, specifically her ability to identify a Pygmy Nuthatch, but the bird we see is not a nuthatch at all but a member of the oriole family. McG and Drew Barrymore (who acted as producer as well as taking the role of Dylan) should be charged with film-making without due care and attention. 3/10.",Charlie's Angels
28,StevePulaski,The sucking of soul,4,3 August 2012,"It's been a while since I've felt so distant watching a film. I think the last time was when I watched and reviewed Film Socialisme, a picture that's idea is still unfathomable to me today. But while that film was a piece of indulgent French cinema, Charlie's Angels is a piece of mind-numbing American cinema, so pick your poison.I have yet to encounter a film based off a Television show from decades past that has amused me enough to earn a recommendation rating. The Dukes of Hazzard was a hackneyed and a cherry-picking reboot to a show that must've had more appeal than mindless car chases (the show was unseen by me), the film Starsky and Hutch was elevated just barely by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson's capable casting, but everything else was seemingly on autopilot, and do we even need to mention Bewitched? And don't even get me started on those CGI/live action hybrids...Back on track with Charlie's Angels, the film I should be discussing. Its basic story concerns the three angels, Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz), Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore), and Alex Munday (Lucy Liu), and their mission, which they choose to accept, involves safely returning Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), of the famous Knox Enterprises, back from Roger Corwin (Tim Curry), a satellite-communications expert who has kidnapped him for one reason or another. The angels use their sly and sexy skills, if that's what we're calling them, to infiltrate the scheme and rescue the man as fast as possible.Am I not mistaking? Isn't that how the back of the box would describe ""Charlie's Angels: The Video Game?"" I would say so. The film looks and plays less like a movie, but more like a cheap, video game demo involving three girls who hunger for action that were summoned straight out of a lonely geek's head. There's even several pointless scenes (and there are many of these, but these kinds are certainly the most pointless ones) involving Natalie dancing in her underwear as soon as she gets out of bed or grooving it to that ever-so-mindless Sir Mix a Lot jam, ""Baby Got Back"" on Soul Train while numerous people chant, ""go white girl, go white girl!"" It's scenes like that that make me wonder if a film even cares if we pay attention to it or not.The same thing Hollywood would later ruin about The Dukes of Hazzard becomes Charlie's Angels most glaring problem; the insulting simplification of its story, plot, and characters. When Hollywood proposed the idea of creating a Dukes of Hazzard film, they most likely thought up the most logical thing to feature in a film with ""them Duke boys"" and that thought immediately was car chases. When the executives thought up the most logical thing to feature prominently in a Charlie's Angels film, it was ""the character's sexiness and fulfilling the urge to blow somethin' up real good."" That's exactly what it did. It doesn't even have the humor and barely passable idiocy Michael Bay's Bad Boys had, and I can't believe I'm complementing one of his films for having something that another doesn't.If development would've been taken into consideration, if a wider range of ideas would've been explored, and if the route of featuring flyweight women in tight leather suits would've been traded for some serene wit and at least some sign of intelligence, we might have a decent, memorable Charlie's Angels film. But that's asking a lot from an industry that sucks dry everything likable about something classic and reworks and remolds it into something of total banality.Starring: Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, Sam Rockwell, Tim Curry, Crispin Glover, Luke Wilson, Bill Murray, and Tom Green.

29,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Oh, those silly angels, if only they weren't so exploited",5,24 October 2006,"I remember in 2000, I was a sophomore in high school, so naturally, you'd think this movie would've been perfect for me. But I got so annoyed with how advertised it was and how Cameron, Drew, and Lucy just wouldn't stop holding hands! It was just so annoying and Charlie's Angels proved to be that this was the director's wet dream when he was a pre-teen looking up at those famous Farah Faucett posters.Charlie's Angels was a fun TV series in the 70's about three very attractive ladies: Alex, Dylon, and Natalie who fought crime and just had so much fun with their sex appeal. It was a fun time and wasn't too exploited, well, if you watch this movie, forget all that. I decided to wait until I was ready to watch this movie without being so judgemental, well, it reached my expectations when I was 15! Basically, the girls are just trying to save Charlie's life from a villain who thinks Charlie killed his dad. This film made me wonder, the 70's action sequences worked so well, so why did we need all the CGI effects in this film? Not to mention, Cameron Diaz could break easily, this was so not believable.Cameron, Lucy, and Drew, these girls just didn't seem like the perfect angels. But maybe that's just me. Charlie's Angels wasn't as bad as I expected, but still, that's not saying much, it just couldn't stay on the right direction and was too exploited. I wouldn't mind taking a peek at the sequel, I'm hoping maybe they might do something right, but if the rating on IMDb is right, maybe I should think first.5/10",Charlie's Angels

31,MovieAddict2016,Delivers What it Promises...,6,4 April 2003,"""Charlie's Angels"" has been taking a lot of heat for being stupid, ridiculous, immature, etc...and while it's definitely not a great film, I can't help but half-enjoy it.Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu fill in the shoes of the Angels, from the hit TV show ""Charlie's Angels""--remember that show? Well, in this film, the Angels must stop a madman from doing something bad somewhere in the world. I'm not really sure what the plot was, because there really is no plot per say. This film is an excuse for two of Hollywood's prettiest women (Cameron Diaz & Drew Barrymore) running around blowing stuff up in bikinis. I'd have to say that the only thing that keeps this movie from being a better piece of entertainment is the annoying (and horrible actress) Lucy Liu. According to IMDb.com and shows like ""Entertainment Tonight"" and ""Access Hollywood,"" Bill Murray (who played Bosley in this film) did not return for the upcoming sequel because he didn't like working with Liu. I can't say I blame him. Just the sight of her ugly face on screen makes me cringe. I remember an interview with Murray back on the set of the original film, and they asked him about alleged arguments with Lucy Liu on set. He said the accusations were false, but I could tell he was lying.But apart from her, the cast is quite ensemble. The hilarious Bill Murray keeps this film from becoming nothing more than a bikini advert, and the enjoyable Tim Curry helps Murray a lighten the mood a bit in one of the scenes.Sometimes the film uses very odd filming techniques, and ""McG,"" the director, seems to try and go too much for a modern look. But, in a way, it gives the film more of a summer-flick feeling than anything memorable, which is all I want ""Charlie's Angels"" to be.The person going into this expecting Oscar-material has a screw loose.This movie is a lot like the film ""MI:2"" (""Mission: Impossible 2""): it delivers a whole lot of action for a nice night in. It's a summer flick, and nothing more. Pure Entertainment. Maybe a bit whacky at times, but nevertheless entertaining and fun, regardless of some flaws.3/5 stars -John Ulmer",Charlie's Angels

33,sddavis63,A Flawed Remake Of A 70's TV Series,4,17 June 2013,"This is yet another in a long list of movies that Hollywood has put out in the last couple of decades based on old TV series from the 60's and 70's especially (which to me, more than anything else, suggests a lack of creativity on Hollywood's part, since these old shows and premises just keep being recycled one after the other, but that's a whole other story.) Some of these remakes have worked; others haven't. ""Charlie's Angels"" falls more into the latter category to be honest.The TV show was never one that could be taken especially seriously, but for the most part it did try to be serious. This movie, on the other hand, sets ""serious"" aside almost from the opening moment. It's heavy on martial arts fight scenes, and is more of an action movie than anything else. The story (about the attempt of a villain to identify and kill Charlie) lacks coherence and isn't especially logical, but on the other hand the story is really just an excuse for everything else that's happening.In fairness, the fight and action scenes are pretty well done, and the ""Angels"" (played by Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu) are quite lovely, and the movie makes no attempt to hide the fact that it's going for sexiness (all in an acceptable ""PG"" type manner, of course.) Bill Murray adds no sexiness, but he is along for the ride as Bosley. Charlie, as in the TV series, is never seen but is voiced once again by John Forsythe.Generally speaking, though, the story here is simply weak. I wasn't in the least riveted to the screen while watching this, and it really (to me at least, and I admit that I wasn't a big an of the show but I did see a few episodes) didn't capture the spirit of the original ""Charlie's Angels"" TV series.

I do vaguely remember watching the series when I was a kid, but I have no real recollection of it at all. However, this is a film that I hadn't seen, so I decided to give it a shot, and to be honest with you, I really didn't like it. In fact, it really didn't seem to have much flow, and in a lot of cases it was basically all over the place.The film is about three women who live double lives, namely because they are members of an elite crime fighting force. Their missions are given to them by a mysterious Charlie who only ever speaks to them over a radio. There is also another guy who is a part of the group, John Bosworth, who is played by Bill Murray (and Bill Murray does have an ability to always shine in the roles that he plays, and he is no different in this one).To be honest with you, this just seemed to be a collection of action scenes that are thrown together with a vague concept that somebody could refer to as a plot. There are twists in it, but in a lot of cases it really doesn't seem to make too much sense at all, which is probably why it took me at least three goes to actually watch this film, namely because I kept on falling asleep. Then again, it is probably also because I watched it later at night, but then again I have watched other films at night and haven't fallen asleep, so I suspect that it had more to do with this film as opposed to me simply being tired.Yeah, I would recommend giving this one a miss, unless of course you really do want to see Bill Murray, but then again he is in lots, and lots of other films so you don't need to watch this one just to see him.

39,TheMovieDiorama,Charlie's Angels is a heavenly paradise for inexcusably camp charades.,5,24 December 2019,"Adapting classic television series into a feature film was becoming a common trend in the early part of this century. But maintaining the aesthetic appeal of its source material is often blurred with the requirement of targeting mass mainstream audiences. Would viewers of the original Charlie's Angels watch a film continuation? Most likely not. So the legendary (and I use that adjective lightly...) McG decided to go full Hollywood, embracing action spy thrillers that came before, and produced one of the campiest guilty pleasures of all time.Can I describe the plot? Absolutely not. It's thinner that Diaz' lip fillers and needless botox. Three ""Angels"" who privately work for a millionaire are assigned a task in investigating technology giant Red Star. Stuff happens, a predictable plot twist unravels and the booming soundtrack of The Prodigy and Fat Boy Slim illuminate my ears.Let me start by saying I love Charlie's Angels. I love it! It's a film I hold very close to my heart, and a crucial element to my childhood. Probably a reasoning for my raging homosexuality, let's be honest. I mean Barrymore, Diaz and Liu kicking a ""creepy thin man"" repeatedly wearing tight leather costumes in 'Matrix'-stylised slow motion whilst working together as a cohesive unit of female empowerment!? Just lay me to rest, now! Give me a slice of that angel cake and let me never lose that heavenly flavour.Yet, the amateur critic inside me just cannot classify this film as ""good"". Why? Well, because it's not. And it's that ever-growing conflict between biased favouritism and legitimate critiquing that has me torn inside. Firstly, the plot is a mess. To the point where the story is a secondary product to the action set pieces and humorous dance sequences. When talented actors, such as Rockwell, are crucial aspects to this afterthought, it unfortunately wastes their efforts. The frantic editing prevents a natural flow of events, including the extravagant action, that anchors these angels. They are unable to spread their wings and fly.A dire shame considering the undeniable chemistry between the lead actresses, each harnessing a unique personality that allows their characters to connect as a team. Diaz is the ditzy dance queen, shaking her tush on Soul Train. Barrymore is the rebellious punk, sticking her middle finger up to everyone. Liu is the intellectual well-mannered lady, riding horses and piloting space rockets. They each add enough humour to come together seamlessly. Essentially, I live for them. The dialogue is cheesy and contagious, if ridiculously vacuous in subject matter. And the constant use of the same songs, namely ""Heaven"" and ""Smack My B**** Up!"", lacked variety. Despite my internal love for The Prodigy and Fat Boy Slim.As far as guilty pleasures go, Charlie's Angels is up there for me. It's poorly directed and woefully written, but I cannot deny my adoration for this campy beast.

42,Anonymous_Maxine,Who's that guy? That's George McFly!,6,7 May 2001,"Charlie's Angels is a pretty sad attempt to cash in on the looks of three of the more attractive actresses working today (although I am sad to say that Drew hardly fits in that category anymore), and the film's similarity to the traditional James Bond formula is a little hard not to notice. Cameron Diaz is an absolute bimbo in this movie, and although Drew Barrymore plays a relatively respectable character, her effectiveness isn't that great, especially given her whiny performances in such recent movies as Home Fries, Never Been Kissed, and The Wedding Singer. The biggest contribution that Drew made to this movie was getting her boyfriend to take a bit part in it.Despite the lack of creativity and the blatant sexual exploitation of Charlie's Angel's, there can be no denying the fact that it just had some good action and at least a few scenes that were really good. There was some fighting action that was really fun to watch, despite the fact that the cinematography was literally stolen from The Matrix, and let's not forget the fact that the Thin Man, with whom the angels had their first confrontation and who made surprisingly classy appearances throughout the film, was the guy who played George McFly in the great Back To The Future trilogy (well, part I and some of part II, anyway). Those are some of my favorite movies ever, and I haven't seen him in many other movies, so I thought it was really cool to see him in a movie again.
Charlie's Angels is an un-creative action crime film that continuously and excessively exploits the hotties that star in it, and relies almost solely on their looks as well as some flashy music to push the movie along. There can be no doubt about the fact that the music in the film was thrown in just to promote the soundtrack and make more money. There was hardly a second that went by that there wasn't another song playing, regardless of whether or not it had anything to do with what was happening on screen. There's so much trendy music packed into this movie that it almost overshadows everything else. Notice that they put that ridiculously popular Jennifer Lopez song (the title of which I don't know or care to know and, of course, by ridiculously popular,' I mean that it's ridiculous that it is popular) over the end credits. Some of the music was good, but it was poured on so thickly that it becomes cloying and suffocating.

To my surprise, it turned out to be an entertaining movie, if you don't take it too seriously. Based on the 1970s TV series of the same name, this remake is updated to the present and is essentially a comic book come to life. The plot is incidental to the babes, the action and the seemingly impossible array of stunts. It is surely a showcase for the physical attributes of its three female stars.All are given ample opportunity to display their fabulous figures and to wear various fancy super-hero costumes. Some of the situations are taken right from the old Saturday afternoon serials. For example, the three heroines get blown up at least twice, fall off buildings, one even dodges a bullet and all emerge without so much as a scratch or a hair out of place. Starring as the ""angels"" are Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and the delectable Lucy Liu. All have the bodies and mischievous twinkles in their eyes to carry all of this nonsense off. Bill Murray as Bosley almost steals the picture. It was good to see him back in form. The only holdover from the TV series is John Forsythe who again provides the voice for the never seen Charlie. Others in the cast include Sam Rockwell and Kelly Lynch as the good guys/bad guys, Tim Curry wasted in a small role and Crispin Glover as a sort of robotic henchman. LL Cool J and Tom Green put in cameo appearances along the way. ""Charlie's Angels"" is a fun movie.",Charlie's Angels
47,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Charlie's Angels,7,18 October 2019,7/10 - campy 2000s action flick is a lot of fun for an evening-in,Charlie's Angels
48,meeza,Not Heaven Or Hell!,6,6 July 2001,"The film version of `Charlie's Angels' was in limbo so many times during pre-production that many critics felt that this one was going straight to hell! However, I guess `destiny' took its course and the film was completed despite of many `child'-type obstacles that included a feud between stars Bill Murray and Lucy Liu. Speaking of Destiny's Child (who sing the theme song to the movie) my destination is to write this review with their song in mind:Stars Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Lui did look good- they got it!The screenplay was very intellectual and enticing- not got it!The special effects and choreography was very inventive and original- it got it!The ending was unexpected and creative- not got it!So `put your hands up in the air' if you like good looking actresses & cool set designs- go see it! But if you are looking for an original plot and diverse screenplay- don't see it! (sorry Charlie!)*** Average",Charlie's Angels
49,Chris_Docker,No frills entertainment - switch mobile phone and brain off first,5,27 November 2000,"Available in a cinema near you in lobotomyscope and lycravision, Charlie's Angels kung-fu there way through this enjoyable spoof without wasting time on subtlety. Don't worry if you were admiring Diaz's lovely torso at a critical plot juncture - if you missed anything they will explain it again slowly a few minutes later. Diaz seems to have such a great time being a superhero that I wonder if she should have paid the studio a few million instead of the other way around - but at least she comes across with verve and a certain charisma. Sidekicks Liu and Barrymore realise this movie doesn't require too much acting skill and so don't lower themselves to such seriousness. From fantastic outfits to cool locations and the latest slow-motion bullet sfx (taken shamelessly from the Matrix), Charlie's Angels spends 90 million dollars without too much attention to plot, script or anything else except providing a feelgood action film with three lovely ladies strutting their stuff as they chase villains and lots of nice explosions and fast cars and things. Don't go to see it in a critical mood - make it the finale to a good night out on the town and soak up the entertainment value.",Charlie's Angels
50,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,One of the highest-powered crime flicks I've ever seen!,10,30 January 2006,"Despite the fact that I haven't seen the TV show, this is one of the highest-powered crime flicks I've ever seen. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu really dazzled as three detectives who are really good masters of disguise. If you ask me, they were also very pretty. They can really give a high-powered crime flick a nice touch. I was really surprised at the way Dylan (Drew Barrymore) used her karate skills and then said, ""And that's kicking your a**!"" CHARLIE'S ANGELS really kept me on the edge of my seat. It was really enjoyable. It was really suspenseful, too. Lucy Liu flick I ever saw. You go, girl! Go, Cameron! Go, Drew!",Charlie's Angels
51,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A bubblegum blast of energy,7,11 January 2016,"I never saw the original Charlie's Angels TV series, so I don't know how the film version holds up in tone and consistency, but I do know I enjoyed that hell out of it, and that it makes a terrific standalone movie. The tone is pure radical sassiness, mainly from its three hyperactive stars who are equal parts dangerous, cute and fun loving. Lucy Liu is all flippant business as Alex, Drew Barrymore a tough cookie tomboy as Dylan, and Diaz the bubbly, slightly ditzy Natalie, perhaps the most fun out of the trio of performances. They each have their integral qualities as individuals, but it's when the three get together as a group that the film's invigorating sense of fun truly takes hold, whether using teamwork to throw around all kinds of wild karate justice or simply just hanging out in their office chatting, these chicks are no end of a good time. The movie is helmed by McG (before he ruined his street cred with the abysmal Terminator: Salvation) and flies along with frenetic style and a whole bag of shiny filmmaking tricks that look like Oliver Stone made a flick for MTV. Bill Murray plays Bosley, and his chemistry with the gals is flint spark perfection, the scenes with the four of them the crest of the wave that the film let's you ride on. The four of them get entangled in a plot involving several shady characters including Sam Rockwell and a spindly Crispin Glover as a shrieking weirdo with a hair fetish. Other players include Matt Leblanc, Luke Wilson and a certifiable Tom Green as Dylan's extremely strange ex boyfriend. Plot gets left in the dust of the stylistic momentum that hurtles at you like a candy coated lip gloss steam engine of attitude, which is fine by me. It's more of a vehicle for the three gals to have fun, play dress up and kick butt than a serious detective story, which for me was a wise move. John Forsythe is the only character to reprise his role from the show, as the kindly voice of Charlie, ever heard but never seen. The 2003 sequel is the same, but more. More juiced up style, more celebrity cameos, more, more more. While still fun, it's overkill and will leave you nostalgic for this first outing, which got the formula just right.",Charlie's Angels
52,slokes,Women's Work,6,21 January 2013,"Is it a crass rehash of an old TV series that wasn't that great to begin with? Or is it a clever distillation of 1970s entertainment spruced up with a welcome blend of comedy and flash style? I can't really decide, but ""Charlie's Angels"" manages to earn its wings, if not a halo.Sorry. Be warned, though, there are a lot of bad puns in this movie. ""Charlie's Angels"" never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously, and if you don't either, you can have a bit of fun.The set-up is instantly familiar for those of us old enough to remember the ABC-TV series. Three beautiful young women work as private detectives for a mysterious millionaire, who gives them impossible assignments they carry out with ease. The latest job involves a computer tycoon named Knox who is kidnapped, apparently by a rival. The Angels set out to save him, then find out the case is more complicated than it appears.That's not really important, though. The big question: Which Angel does the best hair flip? I have to say its Lucy Liu, though Cameron Diaz's short hair doesn't give her much to work with and Drew Barrymore's Angel with attitude isn't really flipping her hair unless she's in a fight, which kind of buries that bit of business for her. Not much else distracts from the hotitude of the stars, suggesting that the trainers on set were Oscar-worthy even if the cast wasn't.The script is kind of weak, not that the show itself ever was ""St. Elsewhere."" Caught wearing only a bedsheet in a guy's apartment, Barrymore's character is asked if she's ""working undercover.""More funny are the exaggerated references to how deadly these pretty ladies really are. ""They come on all lovey-dovey, until they find out I can shatter a cinderblock with my forehead,"" sighs Liu. Here at least the comedy works as a kind of running gag worth pursuing.This silliness is abetted by Bill Murray as Bosley, the Angels' major domo, working his comedy mojo in a lazy but effective way, describing a jail as looking like ""Cher's bedroom."" Diaz has the most fun with her part, as Natalie the klutzy cutie, showing off a wonderful body as well as some fine comic chops left over from ""There's Something About Mary."" Whatever happened to her, anyway? I also really like Crispin Glover, as a bad guy who never says a word but steals every scene he's in with creepy gusto. Too bad the film never seems to know what to do with him, though at least he's not wasted like Tim Curry is here.For the most part, director McG and his writing team just use the story as an excuse for action scenes that are often impressive but don't make sense or connect up with anything else. These Angels are hard to distinguish from bad guys, as they crash cars, depressurize airliner cabins, and generally wreak all kinds of havoc on unsuspecting civilians. You aren't supposed to wonder about all this because, well, it's that kind of film.And that's fine, when the film does as much as this one to keep you diverted. That's all you get here, and all you really need. I mean, if you are going to watch a film called ""Charlie's Angels,"" you shouldn't expect tight plotting and stuff. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. I did.",Charlie's Angels
53,Boyo-2,"Perfect balance of comedy, f/x action and Angels",7,23 April 2001,"I was not a fan of the TV series ""Charlie's Angels"" and I doubt I ever saw an episode.  What seems funny about that is that now I know more about the show than I ever did, thanks to the movie.  If there were stupid plot points, lots of jiggling in teeny costumes which change by the second, and explosions, then the movie followed its inspiration closely. There was several laugh-out loud scenes, some very boring scenes and a lot of things that go boom for those impressed with that. I like Lucy Liu the best of the Angels and my favorite scene involved Drew in danger of getting killed in a penthouse apartment. Something about the way it was photographed made the scene stand out, I can't explain it totally but it seemed very different from everything else. Nice that the girls found time for their guys, and for Tom Green too.",Charlie's Angels
54,questl-18592,CA1,5,14 March 2020,"With the recent release of Charlie's Angels (2019), whichi didn't love, it felt like it was time to go revisit the 2000 film. I'm glad I did too, because my memory of this really wasn't doing me any favors.Right up front, it's so obvious that this was filmed by a guy, which is so not a good thing. The Angels are stereotypes, they're constantly oversexualized and regularly focus on they're relationships with men, not to mention an odd sense of fawning over the disembodied voice of Charlie as well as Murray's Bosley. With a contemporary perspective on gender equality and feminism and all our modern political correctness... Oof. This fails hard at that. That said, the ladies are strong and capable on their own, it's just hard to take that serious when they're constantly presented as sexual objects.That's the main negative of this movie to me, but take that away and this is an energetic, action and comedy packed extravaganza in that crazy late '90s early 2000s style of craziness. The actors all seem to be having a lot of fun with it, the story makes sense and I always enjoy Rockwell.I try not to hold modern standards against older movies as strongly but it's so all over this one that I can't help but heavily knock it down for that. Still, it's a fun, mindless watch if you get the chance.",Charlie's Angels
55,rbverhoef,It's hard not to like the girls,6,3 August 2003,"Whether you like 'Charlie's Angels' or not will probably depend on whether you like watching beautiful ladies Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore. Up to a point I liked it, or actually I liked the fun the women were having with their parts. Especially Diaz and her behind and Barrymore in total really show they have a lot of fun. Another part of the fun comes from Bill Murray who has a lot of moments that will make you smile.What about other things in this film? Story for example. In a film like this that really is the last thing you should worry about. The film is not about story, it is about the three ladies in their action scenes. Admittedly they look great in them, although most of the action scenes were not that great. Again, for watching Diaz, Liu and Barrymore because they are beautiful or to see the fun performers can have 'Charlie's Angels' is worth watching. But for no other reason, I would say.",Charlie's Angels
56,a_chinn,"Vapid fluff, but entertaining fluff",6,21 October 2017,"This film is wildly 1990s hip and very of it's time, which is probably indicatives of how vapid the late 90s were, lacking in a clear identity of it's own, instead relying on retro nostalgia. Sure there was grunge, ""Friends,"" and the Spice Girls, but those were really all just throwback as well and I'm not sure that's much of a cultural identity. But enough about 1990s being a cultural wasteland when compared to the 60s, 70s, or 80s. As vapid and lightweight of a film as ""Charlie's Angels"" is, it's also a whole lot of fun. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu play the super spy/detective angels, with the help of Bosley, a always great Bill Murray, have to foil a plot to steal software or something. The plot here really doesn't matter because the film is basically a series of barely connected but funny scenes/vignettes consisting of comedy, sexiness, or well done fight sequences (choreographed by Cheung-Yan Yuen, the fight choreographer from my favorite Jet Li movie ""Fist of Legend""). The fun does feel forced at times, but it's an extremely likable cast, which include a ton of familiar faces in supporting roles (Sam Rockwell, Tim Curry, LL Cool J, Luke Wilson, Matt LeBlanc, and Tom Green (there's a 90s wasteland figure I'd forgotten about!). Crispin Glover is the biggest standout of the supporting cast as the deadly mute assassin know as ""Thin Man"" who dresses like he's stepped off the set of ""The Avengers."" Overall, ""Charlie's Angels"" is the epitome of fluff, but it's enjoyable fluff and not all that dissimilar from a 1960s Flint or Matt Helm movie.",Charlie's Angels
57,triple8,Bears Little resembelence to the TV show and is a bit better then it could have been but not great.,6,17 August 2003,"Charlie's Angels the movie bears little if any resemblance to Charlie's Angels the Television Show and it might be good to keep that in mind. That said-turned out better then it could have. Parts of it are funny but you have to keep in mind it's like watching a movie about 3 different women. None of the 3 angels in the movie have any completely developed, distinct personality, their all sort of these spastic women, but the personalities are not developed, they all kind of mirror each other.This is more a movie to watch for the killer action sequences where Barrymore, Diez and Lu show what they've got with leaps, kicks and other funky action scenes. It's enjoyable in a popcorn sort of way, just don't sit there thinking you'll even get a glimpse of the original Jill, Kelly or Sabrina.",Charlie's Angels
58,Spleen,Let's not be too hard on the Angels,6,14 June 2001,"You know, these Matrix-style fight sequences are starting to get annoying. I'm not a fan of the genre, but I can tell that the CGI choreographers are missing something here: they fail to convey ANY sense of what's possible, in the world of the fiction, and what's not.  The fight between the three angels and the whippersnapper with a briefcase is like a video game fight between two opponents who have set their strength and agility at ""maximum"" and their hit points at ""limitless"" - it's uncreative, and trying to watch.The basic fantasy is good.  And I'm glad to see that the film doesn't dilute it, for the sake of either realism or subtlety.  A fiction that so nakedly indulges male daydreams - some female, and some gender-neutral daydreams as well, no doubt - needn't reign it in for subtlety's sake.  If anything ""Charlie's Angels"" doesn't indulge our daydreams (ahem) nakedly enough. This is not some prime time television show - this is CINEMA, for God's sake, and a few bare breasts wouldn't be too much to ask for.  Well, I suppose cheerful, G-rated pseudo-erotica is better than nothing.  Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu, tame though their teasing is, are a delight to look at; Cameron Diaz might be as well if she wasn't playing the foolishly grinning doofus type.  I admire her nerve: time after time, she allows herself to be cast presumably against type as the Comparatively Unlovely Woman.  (""My Best Friend's Wedding"" and ""Being John Malkovich"" are two other examples, although in the latter she tries too hard, and becomes more appealing than her co-star after all.)Several critics have wondered aloud if there's a movie here at all underneath all the shiny plastic packaging.  I think there is.  It's not good, but it has some positive virtues, and it deserves marks for unreservedly entering into the fantasy of the television show when so many other tv-based films maintain a knowing distance.  A mere ten years ago ""Charlie's Angels"" would have been a sour disappointment.  These days it's above average.  Not by much, I'll be the first to admit.",Charlie's Angels
59,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It entertains mindlessly,6,6 July 2014,"When it comes to female leads in action roles, the names Angelina Jolie or Milla Jovovich may come to mind. They play serious roles with a tad bit of wisecracks and a bunch of violence, specifically with weapons. When that genre is flipped on its head and made into an action comedy, it then fits for a different set of actresses. In some ways, this movie is the definition of how masculine a chick flick can possibly get. It still has all the basic set-ups for a chick flick, but this time it includes explosions and hand-to-hand combat. There's nothing wrong with that particular element, but as a whole it really doesn't have any substance that defines itself from other chick flicks of that decade (other than its explosions and combat).Charlie's Angels (2000) is another cinema adapted TV show from the 1970s that hoped to capitalize on its nostalgic feel while mixing in Hollywood's biggest grabs at the time. Our main protagonists are Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu as the spy trio who take orders from a faceless billionaire named by Charlie (voice by John Forsythe). Helping them in their travels and spy tactics is Bosley (Bill Murray). When they receive a distress call about a scientist (Sam Rockwell) being kidnapped, they head out to infiltrate and save him. This is all fine but everything else involved in the writing is fairly one-dimensional. I'm guessing because all three writers were guys and they had no clue what to include except the cliché things.Problems arise in the movie's plot when the story tries to focus on each of the Spys' personal lives. Each Angel is in the state of ""Ugh, I can't find a way to balance my professional career with my social life"". Though somehow, one would think when they agreed to work for Charlie they would've understood that from the start. Besides, these particular subplots didn't go anywhere anyway. There wasn't much closure at all other than what you would expect when it came to the main plot. Along with that are either some obvious sexual humor, meaning to play off of the female leads. Some of it might produce a chuckle but sometimes it painstakingly bad. There's even some jokes that may not be understood at all.There are also appearances from other actors you wouldn't expect to see too often. Matt LeBlanc, Tom Green, Luke Wilson, Crispin Glover and even Tim Curry. Sadly everyone mentioned before Curry gets more screen time than he does. Tim Curry will always be an underrated actor and he should've been given more screen time. How do you shorthand Tim Curry? But Curry did at least sumo fight Murry. That was funny. When it came to action however, it entertained. Hand-to-hand combat is always more interesting to watch than constant explosions because there is always room for improvisation. This also what helps make this movie more fun than a normal chick flick because our three main leads have not taken on very many action roles in their career. It's a nice turn.Of course a number of action sequences aren't believable at times but they at least will keep the attention of the viewer. That's important. The camera-work was fairly steady and the cinematography by Russell Carpenter looked good. It wasn't breath taking, but there were nice set pieces and backgrounds he did get shots of. The music by Ed Shearmur was interesting at best. There were moments where he was able to create some good tension while at other times it didn't work or there was contemporary music played instead. Mehh,...it was alright. What did surprise me was how many times the movie tried to make references to angels in general. Come on, we get it. No need to hammer it in to our skulls. It's an OK film.Its humor helps slightly in its favor along with likable leads, fun action and underrated supporting actors like Bill Murry and Tim Curry. Yet, it still can't remove itself from feeling like a chick flick.",Charlie's Angels
60,Kamurai25,Drew Barrymore and Tom Green make a cute couple,6,4 July 2020,"Good watch, might watch again, can recommend.This is a weird one to analyze. It's a anti-male sexist (it basically makes the point that all men are horny, dumb, animals unless they have something as an equivalent drive), but is certainly presented in a fashion for people into women (chiefly men) while the main cast (the 3 women) acts like alpha male frat boys who talk like nerds. Granted all this is the stereotypical movie versions, so maybe the point is that movies are dumb and they do poor portrayals of characters as real people.If you get past that stuff, or just try to enjoy the movie, it's a lot of fun and it has some really good action, though there is some obvious wire work.It also has a fantastic cast: while I'm not a fan of Cameron Diaz or Drew Barrymore, I can't deny them as good actors, Lucy Liu, Tim Curry, Bill Murry, Sam Rockwell, and Crispin Glover (George McFly) are all great.The story uses some decent writing, but fore shadows a little bit much in places, which does create a payoff, but if you can cut that and the villain monologuing, I'd even say this is a great action movie.But that is coming from someone that believes an action movie should be more than an action movie, so take that as you will.",Charlie's Angels
61,philip_vanderveken,"""Oh, another movie from an old TV show.""",5,2 November 2004,"I guess the best joke could be found at the beginning of the movie. In the airplane a black gentleman, played by Drew Barrymore, says to the passenger next to him (her): ""Oh, another movie from an old TV show."" when the movie T.J. Hooker, the movie is shown. I couldn't phrase it in a better way. Hollywood seems to think that we all have been waiting for movies based on comic books (Hellboy, Spiderman, ...) or old TV series, most of the time from the seventies (Charlie's Angels, Starsky and Hutch, ...). Perhaps other people have, but I certainly haven't. That doesn't mean that the original series weren't any good, but they were created for an audience in the seventies, with ideas and techniques from the seventies. As a kid I loved ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" and ""The A-Team"", but that doesn't mean that I want to see them in a new movie.I really don't like all those remakes, yet I watched Charlie's Angels anyway. I did so, only because a friend recommended it to me. He said it was one of his favorite movies, so I gave it a chance... but it didn't convince me at all. It's just not my kind of movie, it feels too much like James Bond, with the only difference that this time the action hero isn't a man, but three completely different ladies. Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu are very nice eye candy (I'm only a man of flesh and blood), but their performances in this movie haven't convinced me to watch other movies in which they play. The story is unbelievably thin and shallow and the main concerns clearly were about the gadgets, the explosions and about how to show the girls in the best way possible (without showing any full frontal nudity). But I have to be honest, I didn't think everything was bad. The fight sequences are well choreographed, but are clearly inspired on the ""The Matrix"" trilogy (including the ""bullet time"" effect, for which the Matrix films are famous), which hasn't got to be a bad thing of course.As a conclusion I would like to say that I guess that I belong to the wrong demographic to fully appreciate this movie. I think this movie will be loved most by young males in their puberty. Another possibility is of course that I ask too much of a movie. Up to you to decide which of the two is true...

Sometimes I had the impression to watch ""Hot Shots"" or ""The Naked Gun"" or a parody of James Bond movies. The film was well accompanied by music hits from the 80s to 90s. I don´t have much more to say about only just average. Definitive not a must see. Perhaps the second Charlie´s Angels will be better. 6/10.",Charlie's Angels

This movie captures that self-mockery formula, and plays it to the hilt.Like the 70's show, three beautiful ladies don such outfits as tight black leather jeans, exquisite nightgowns, and of course the old standby, skimpy beach wear. Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu drop kick, sucker punch, and otherwise hammer the snot out of unsuspecting villainous extras, usually while telling one-liner jokes. The plot is something about stolen software, but who cares? The point of the whole thing is the Angels and their antics, nothing more.Bill Murray, an A-list celeb who occasionally pops up in supporting roles in crazy movies just for the fun of it, is wasted as Bosley, liaison to the mysterious Charlie, since all he is given to do is ham it up and mug a little bit. John Forsythe reprises his voice-over role from the TV show as the unseen boss of the outfit, a pleasant, nostalgic touch.It's a good thing that it's all supposed to be camp anyway, since Drew and Cameron couldn't box their way out of a paper bag. Their fight moves are so comically awkward, that you know it was intended to be absurd. Lucy Liu, however, is not somebody I would want to meet in a dark alley at night--she is sensational in the action scenes, and gives this movie whatever credence it does have.Just a joke movie all the way through.

The Plot makes a bit more sense than Full Throttles did. Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle's plot was incomprehensible. I really don't know what exactly the film was about. That film was forgettable, this film is memorable. I know that lines like "" I think the client was blown away"" are stupid. But Charlie's Angels has a good soundtrack, and it's just plain fun.

68,baumer,All hail Crispin Glover,6,6 November 2000,"There are just some films that you know are going to be huge.  It's inevitable.  Audiences have a varacious appetite for certain films but figuring out what types of films those are is half the game.  With an ever vacilating market and fickle fans staying away from the theater with the exception of a few monster films thus far ( including Meet The Parents, Remember the Titans, Gladiator and Mission Impossible II ) Charlie's Angels looked all the more appealing.  With every commercial and trailer for the film, I kept saying to myself and everyone else that would listen ""this film is going to make 30 million in it's first weekend.""  And you know what, it demolished that prediction.  It made 40.  Perhaps we have been waiting for a silly yet fun film like this to grace our screens ever since the summer faded into fall and what reveries we had of the summer were nothing more than a handful of good films and tail wind of mediocrity.  Last year was one of the best summers in recent summers.  With  financial successes and well made films like Sixth Sense, Blair Witch, American Pie, Dogma, Notting Hill and so on, this year all but crumbled under the added pressure of last year. There were few good films to cheer for.  Now, here we are heading into ""the Oscar season"" and we have two huge films that audiences are seemingly in love with that have no chance of winning Oscars.  And Charlie's Angels is one of them.Was this a good film?  I personally don't think so.  But it certainly wasn't an awful one.  When I pay to see a film, there are two things that I hope for when I sit my butt down in the theater.  One is to be entertained and two is to not be insulted.  Charlie's Angels got half of both of those right.  I was mildly entertained and I was somewhat insulted in some of the film.  The insulted part is really just a matter of taste so perhaps we can look past that, but only perhaps.  As for the entertaining aspect, allow me to retort.To be honest, the only part about the first half that was good, was Tom Green and Crispin Glover.  Green's ""Was it the Chad"" bit was hysterical. Chad was really just his character from Road Trip, on a boat.  It's fun to see bit parts like this stand out.  Crispin Glover was also brilliant.  And it is funny to say that about him because for one, he didn't say a word and two, most people that I know think of him only as George ""Hey you, get your damn hands off her"" McFly from Back to the Future.  That is a long time to be stuck in a stereotype.  But I think after this movie is secured in the annals of film, his smoking, karateing, hair sniffing, silent, smoking, square jawed, Thin Man character will be up there as one of his best characters.  He was sinister and even though he was a parody of so many film and television villains, he stood out on his own.  I turned to my friend at one point in the film and said to him, ""Who would have thought McFly was so agile?""Charlie's Angels is fun in many ways but then it is also bad in so many other ways.  I wasn't sure what it was trying to do.  Was it trying to parody some films or just plain rip them off because it couldn't think of anything intelligent to say when the script called for some intelligence? And this is where the the frustration sets in.  One bad scene in particular is the Drew Barrymore scene where she is tied to a chair and five or so thugs are about to manhandle her.  She then tells them to stop and they do, and then she tells them exactly hoe she is going to dispose of them, ala True Lies.  It was funny in True Lies, it is embarrassing in Charlie's Angels.  It doesn't ring true.  And that is what I didn't understand about the film.  Was that the aesthetic that it was going for?  Did it want to be a satire of spy films, did it want to have no mind of it's own?  I'm not sure but that is where it insults me.  Those are the areas that I did not enjoy.  There was plenty of Charlie's Angels stuff to use from the television show that they did not need to use any of the material from good films.  When you have no identity, your film lacks and in the first half of the film, I thought I was going to walk out.  It really was quite bad. Cameron Diaz saved it for me because, well, she is, to be quite blunt, gorgeous.  Her ditzy turn as a sexual being without knowing she was, was quite titilating.  But physical attributes of a character do not make the film worth while.  Even the silly antics of Bill Murray as Bosley seemed to be wasted.  And when Bill Murray just blends into the film without standing out, you have problems.The second half of the film was better.  It wasn't great but it was certainly better than the first half.  The Thin Man is featured more and there are some great battles between the Angels and the bad guys.  That does not mean the film is redeemable enough to be a good film, it just means that it gets better as the film goes on.  There is one other thing that bothers me about Charlies Angels and some other films today and that is the fighting sequences.  Here is a tip to future choreographers of fights.  There is a reason that Reeves and Fishburne and company could fight the way they did in the Matrix.  They were inside a frickin COMPUTER program!!!!  That is why they could walk on walls and kick seven times in mid air before they hit someone.  With recent films like Romeo Must Die and now this one, they make their heroes and heroines fight like they are Gods.  It may look neat to have Barrymore and Diaz and company do the splits in the air and then kick two guys before flipping backwards and then landing on their feet, but it doesn't make any sense!!Charlie's Angels is fun....sometimes.  Other times it is quite tedious and silly and well, you get the picture.  It doesn't really matter though. People are going to love this film and it will make a ton of money and hey, that is fine.  I'm critisizing this film and I will swear on all that is holy that the Friday the 13th films are some of the best horror films in the world (only up until the 4th one, come on, give me a bit of credit).  Go figure.  To each his or her own, I guess.  So if you see this film, enjoy it for what it is, not for what it seems like it could be and what it may be in the makers heads.  Whatever!  It is entertaining and it serves it's purpose. That may be just enough.  Plus, the Thin Man is fun to cheer for and against.  6 out of 10",Charlie's Angels

71,mattymatt4ever,Pure trash...none of the fun,3,21 April 2001,"I've seen a lot of trashy films in my time, and you know what I think of most of them?  I actually thought they were pretty cool.  So I want everyone to know that I'm no cinematic snob.  I've endured tons of criticism for liking ""Starship Troopers,"" ""The Avengers,"" ""Hollow Man"" and films of that type.  But this time...I wasn't having any fun.  But I'm sure the guys are thinking, ""When an action-packed movie has three hot chicks, what can go wrong?""  Watch this movie and you'll know.The jokes are so cheap, the action is so noticeably faked and the whole film is edited like a music video--It was directed by McG whose only previous experience was with music videos.  Coincidence?  People complain about Michael Bay's films having too much cutting.  Watch the opening action sequence of this movie, and you'll see what it means to have too much cutting.  A story seems almost non-existent, so it looks like just a series of vignettes with the girls changing costumes by the minute.  I've never watched the old TV show, but I'm pretty sure this is another overblown Hollywood handling of a classic program.  Never underestimate the uselessness of a big budget.I got tons of criticism from angry men and women who thought this movie was awesome and thought I was a tight-a** for not liking it.  Well, I'm pretty sure my private message box will be filled an hour after I post this review, and I don't care.  This movie was just so unbearable for me to watch, and I found it more unbearable thinking of how much money these producers wasted redundantly on these mindless action sequences.  With all this money that could've been contributed to a worthy cause, Hollywood is fleshing it out on junk like this.This movie takes the trash factor to an all-time low.  There is a scene where Drew Barrymore--apparently--gets shot.  The window behind her cracks and she falls out of it.  I guess we're supposed to assume she's dead. Please keep in mind I'm holding in my laughter right now.  A couple scenes later, we see Drew rolling down a hill and a flashback of what REALLY happened in that scene.  We watch a slow-motion replay--which would've been suitable if it were a football game and not a movie--of the bullet barely missing her and shattering the glass from the window.  Sure, the audience is now nodding their heads and saying ""Ahhhh.  So THAT'S what happened.""  This is a pure insult to one's intelligence.  This is the type of movie that is so dumb it seems to reach out to a target audience of 9 year olds. Probably even they could point out every flaw.If you ever watched the Pamela Anderson show ""VIP"" you should know how it's going to feel watching ""Charlie's Angels.""  Tons of hot chicks, yet unbearable to watch.  Seems like an oxymoron, but it's actually true in both the cases.  As I said, this is trash without the fun.  This is guilt without the pleasure.My score:  3 (out of 10)",Charlie's Angels
72,hall895,Looking good isn't enough,4,26 October 2012,"Charlie's Angels. They kick butt and they look damned good doing it. Unfortunately you need more than good-looking women to make a good movie. For starters, you need a story. And in the story department this movie fails miserably. The plot never engages at all. The surprises aren't surprising. The villain's big scheme is a total dud. Eventually the movie dispenses with the plot altogether and just starts stringing action sequences together. This wears thin very quickly as do the attempts at humor which go from bad to worse as we move along. A movie such as this is meant to be silly, lighthearted fun. Well they got the silly part down. Fun? No, fun is in very short supply.The movie drops any pretense of realism or seriousness right at the start with an opening scene which is absurdly, ludicrously over-the-top. But maybe that's not so bad. Who wants a serious Charlie's Angels movie, right? But the movie never really gets going. It has its three babes, played by Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu. But it doesn't know what to do with them. It seems director McG's guiding principle was ""When in doubt, have Cameron shake her butt again."" We're treated early on to a scene of Diaz dancing in her underwear, shaking it for all she's worth. And then later on they put her up on a stage and just have her dance all over again. Because this movie really has no other ideas. The other girls do get their moments. Barrymore has a scene where she hops in a car, tries to set the world record for most cleavage exposed in a PG-13 movie, and does an interesting thing with her tongue. Liu has a somewhat amusing scene as some sort of corporate dominatrix with a leather fetish. But outside of that one scene Liu shows very little personality while Barrymore is not particularly convincing as an action hero. If any of the three girls could be said to shine it's Diaz. She's the funniest, the hottest, and the kick-buttingest if kick-buttingest is actually a thing. But pretty much everything which surrounds her disappoints. The plot stinks, the villain is a snooze, the dialogue is bad, the humor falls flat and by the end the action sequences are repetitive and interminable. In a movie sorely lacking personality the movie has the wonderfully wacky and unique Crispin Glover on board and then makes no use of him whatsoever. Bill Murray and Tim Curry mail in their performances, not that I can really blame them. The less said about the desperately unfunny Tom Green and Matt LeBlanc the better. Sam Rockwell, Luke Wilson and Kelly Lynch are all here and they all add pretty much nothing to the proceedings. Basically the three girls have to carry the movie on their own and they can't salvage it. Diaz is pretty good, Barrymore and Liu at least passable. But this movie really is a mess. Maybe they should have just let Diaz keep shaking her butt. It's the best thing the movie had to offer.",Charlie's Angels
73,vip_ebriega,Charlie would approve.,8,20 September 2008,"My Take: Energetic, mindless summer eye-candy entertainment. It's easy to smirk or be nit-picky at something quite as silly as a $92 million big-screen version of CHARLIE'S ANGELS. Looking back, its roots date back to a successful yet critically-reviled TV series in the 70's. Bring it here, at our modern period, and be sure to be laughed at. Joel Schumacher did it, in his 1997 mega-expensive bomb (if you call any movie grossing more than a hundred million dollars, a bad as it is, a bomb) BATMAN AND ROBIN, which was immensely hated by everyone (including yours truly). Now comes CHARLIE'S ANGELS, another big-budget comedy action film lifted from some age that probably no longer exists (at least not on our generation). It's director is a former MTV director. And the script, forget it! How could they make a movie like this? Or maybe a more interesting question would be, after watching it, how could I have possibly loved it? Yes! Regardless of having to remind myself that it was meant to be ridiculous, I positively loved CHARLIE'S ANGELS, silliness and all. You can nitpick all the dumbness and stupidity of the script, but here's someone (among a surprisingly high number of others) who are happy to defend its silliness. It's pure style-over-substance matter, and the style really won me over. The stunts are completely unbelievable, the story probably never left the 70's and the script, the whole script, injects enough camp to make this piece sit right there with the original TV show (of which I wasn't exposed to). But the great thing about that is it was thrown in for laughs and a whole lot of fun. The entire piece never took itself seriously, throwing it a lot of brainless fun at every turn. Director McG (born Joseph McGinty Nichol) uses his stylish skills as an MTV director to good use. Every bit feels like an exhilarating no-questions-asked playhouse of brainless style, and I mean that in the nicest of ways.The film is one-part MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (and in one instance, after the Angels have described their plan to break in to a room, like that in the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE movie, one of their superiors tells them ""That's impossible"", followed by a ""Sounds like fun"" response of excitement from the crime-fighting Angels), another-part John Woo action flick, one-part pure 70's camp and another part spoof of it all, and thrown in, for good measure, some MATRIX-inspired slow-mo stunts. After opening with one of its first few outrageous stunt sequences, the story proceeds, concerning a new set of Angels, including smart and uber-sexy Natalie (Cameron Diaz), tough-cookie but never-not-attractive Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and no-nonsense and no-less sex-appeal Alex (Lucy Liu), as always taking orders from unseen voice-in-a-speakerphone Charlie (voiced by John Fosythe, returning to his voice-acting role form the TV show). Their new mission: Retrieve a stolen voice-recognition software from wealthy programmer Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell). They suspect it may be the owner of a rival company (Tim Curry), but the plot thickens. But what plot? This is all but a clothesline for a series of gravity-defying (or at least every form of science imaginable) stunts (an extremely enjoyable array of fight sequences and a slam-bang helicopter finale). There's humor too, provided by the always reliable Bill Murray as Bosley, Charlie's liaison and the Angels' reliable comic-relief sidekick. Bonus points go to the oddball Crispin Glover as the ""Creepy Thin Man"" for providing the finest silent villain since Jaws in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.CHARLIE'S ANGELS is still bound to create a sort of love-hate relationship amongst its viewers. Some will probably hate it for its total disregard of logic and sense. Others will embrace it for what it is: A good, fluffy entertainment (a guilty pleasure if you will). I'm joining that club! Rating: **** out of 5.",Charlie's Angels
74,jhclues,A Dynamic Trio,7,8 November 2000,"In the history of the cinema, most feature films that are the progeny of a successful television series have been less than satisfying or able to capture the essence of the original.  There are exceptions, of course, and `Charlie's Angels,' directed by McG (Joseph McGinty Mitchell), and starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu, is one of them.  A great movie it is not, but it is fun, the trio of Angels are engaging, and it is non-stop action from beginning to end.  It starts with a dynamic skydiving stunt and never slows down.  Along the way a lot of things blow up, there's music,dancing, plenty of stunts, some clever lines and a bit of comedy relief from Bill Murray (Bosley).  There's just enough plot to keep things interesting, but it really doesn't make much difference; this is like a party to which everyone's been invited, and Angels Natalie (Diaz), Dylan (Barrymore) and Alex (Liu) are everything their T.V. counterparts ever hoped to be and more.  This is the way Charlie's team was meant to be. 	What really puts this movie over, though, is the Angels themselves; there's a natural camaraderie between them that seems sincere and never forced, and they all seem to be having a great time, especially the charismatic Diaz, who could easily win an Oscar for Best Supporting Smile.  Barrymore looks good and exhibits plenty of spunk, as does Liu, who has a captivating screen presence as well.  It's all played pretty much straightforward, there's no attempt at parody or heavy drama, and nothing is taken too seriously, which enables the story to move along without getting bogged down with any unnecessary business.  Murray is used just enough to make his presence welcome and effective, and he makes his Bosley fit nicely alongside this latest incarnation of Angels.  The action sequences are well done and the choreography (by Cheung-Yan Yuen) is exciting; the influences of John Woo and `The Matrix' are obvious, and the less experienced McG was wise to draw from the best, for it adds to the success of his film.  There's something of the James Bond films in here, and `Mission Impossible 2' (of course), but to McG's credit, it mainly plays like an extended, more detailed version of the original series. 	The supporting cast includes Tim Curry (Roger Corwin), the versatile Sam Rockwell (Knox), Kelly Lynch (Vivian Wood), Tom Green (Chad) and, in smaller but effective roles, Matt LeBlanc, Luke Wilson, and Crispin Glover.  The familiar voice of Charlie is once again supplied by the man who created the original, John Forsythe.     There's so much energy in this movie you get the feeling that the Angels must have always started their day's work with a triple from Starbucks; it's a high voltage romp that's upbeat and filled with fun and positive vibes.  In the end, `Charlie's Angels' is an entertaining, feel-good  movie that should satisfy a new, younger audience, as well as those with fond memories of the show that started it all a generation ago.  I rate this one 7/10.",Charlie's Angels

You get ""Charlie's Angels"", that's what.  And like ""Mission: Impossible 2"", ""Charlie's Angels"" is another high-profile action movie with A-list everything that just lays there. It has nothing special to offer the viewer outside of some young female star power.  It's one of those movies, that, because of the expense put into its production, has the power to hold your attention for two hours. But after it's over you're bemoaning your wasted time. There's not much here at all. And there's much better in the genre.",Charlie's Angels
77,Bob-45,Drew's Three for Three,7,11 December 2000,"Besides being one of Hollywood's most expressive actresses, Drew Barrymore proves once again she is one of its savviest producers. Her take on CHARLIE'S ANGELS is goofy, cotton candy fun, an terrific evolution rather than remake of the original television series. These three genius airheads (Barrymore, Diaz, Liu) fascinate with their intelligence, arouse us with their looks (for the record, Liu has the best bottom, Barrymore the best bust and Diaz the best all around figure), and entertain us with their cheerleader perkiness; the original angels seem positively arthritic compared to these girls.Evidence that the savvy Barrymore knows her stuff: the film sidesteps the gun issue by having the girls use martial arts and bows and arrows instead of guns.  Within the story's context, this decision makes perfect sense.  However, it does inadvertently point out that guns are PRIMARILY used to AVOID violence when subduing an adversary.  Eschewing firearms, the Angels must resort to kicking butt, opening the Townsend agency to a nasty ""excessive force"" lawsuit, not mention causing unnecessary injuries to both friend and foe. The chemistry between Diaz, Barrymore and Liu is unmistakable.  Barrymore has graciously given her costars more ""showy"" roles. In fact, Barrymore tends to come across as a bit more of a bimbo than either Diaz or Liu.  Nonetheless, all three Angels acquit themselves very well. NOTE TO BARRYMORE:  Don't waste your money on Bill Murray as Bosley. There are lot's of character stars whom would be just as good.  In fact, Murray was a bit of a distraction.  A viewer always expects a ""star"" like Murray to have more to do.  They can't help but be disappointed when he doesn't.As pure escapist entertainment, CHARLIE'S ANGELS, is an even more pleasing movie-from-tv series than either THE FUGITIVE or any of the STAR TREK films. This is eye candy and junk food for the mind.Note to Diaz. You make a great looking redhead.  You out to go for that look for a while.Oh, and one last note to Drew.  Ditch the eye makeup.  You don't need it, and in that scene with you in the jumpsuit at the track, I ASSURE you, NOBODY was looking at your EYES.",Charlie's Angels
78,stamper,"Nice, very nice",8,23 July 2001,"First of all I must say that I enjoyed this movie a lot. Ok you might think it is cheesy when you see the commercials, but it is not. It is just a whacky comedy that really sucks you into the story without ever letting go. This is due to a lot of fun, action, comedy, good actors and actresses (except for one)  and the fact that the jokes never are too cheesy or outrageously stupid. It just sets the tone of comedy immediately in the first few seconds and from there on, the makers stick with that kind of humor.The best things about this movie, besides the fact that it is fast paced and that the length is just perfect, are probably, that there are a lot of action, a lot of jokes and three women who tease the male audience. First of all I must say here that the action scenes are really great (à la The Matrix). The stunts and the kicks are mostly shown in slow-motion, until somebody actually gets hit. Then it's: Wham! and off he goes with tremendous speed. That is really well done and cool and you actually believe that those Angels can do all that stuff.Secondary these babes are high class spies, which work with every weapon they got (the strongest of which are their appearances). Therefore they often dress up in different styles throughout this movie, which I must say fits Drew Barrymore perfectly I must say (blonde, redhead, black hair, she is just HOT). Lucy Lui is OK in all of her outfits and the only one who is kind of a setback is actually Cameron Diaz, whose natural color of hair seems to be the only one that suits her. Talking about appearances, there are many beautiful things for the male eye in this film and some things for comparison for females.Well about the jokes. Some are a bit far out maybe, like when the Angels dress up as German Fräuleins and hop around in traditional clothes they bought in the Alps. But I was not too bothered by them as I was in some other films, although I felt it really showed us, what the best weapon these babes had were, their appearances. I mean, when a guy is confronted with such beauty, his brain is immediately sucked dry of all available blood (which goes elsewhere) and therefore cannot think clearly anymore.Well I really liked this film a lot. Good script, director, actors, actresses, good score, good soundtrack, good camerawork, good producing (keep on going like that Mrs. Barrymore) and good effects. So there I said it all. No wait, there is something wrong here. Oh yes, good actors. All of them? NO. So who is that sucker? Well simple, it is Tom Green, who was also my least favorite character in Road Trip. So, in the end I am really looking forward to seeing a sequel to this film and if Tom Green is not in it, I cannot even wait to see it!

It is as if they are watching another movie entirely. It's as if they were watching the leaden Charlie's Angels sequel Full Throttle. The first Angels however is a great movie if you keep three things in mind. It is mindless. It is fun. It is mindless fun. Never has eye candy had so many empty calories. As nutritious for your brain as a deep-fried Twinkie and with about as much substance, Charlie's Angels is about as quintessential a summer movie as you can get. This is not a bad thing. With a great soundtrack, three hot girls, solid supporting cast and non-stop action even brainless fun can be well good. It is not easy to make a film this shallow, this entertaining. (As the sequel proved and come to think of it dozens of movies prove every summer.) In reality there is a fine line between fluffy, bubble headed, featherbrained fun and feeble-minded, half-witted, imbecilic drudgery. Charlie's Angels stays solidly on the featherbrained, fluffy side. It is that rather rare film that is smart enough to keep it simple and needless to say mindlessly fun.",Charlie's Angels
81,fernandoschiavi,Forget the script totally predictable and full of easy solutions to the puzzles shown. Forget the laws of physics and rational and logical side and embark on wild action,6,4 April 2021,"When news broke that the hugely successful series ""Charlie's Angels"" win a version for the big screen, it's impossible not to refer to the 70s when the first episode of the series debuted, more precisely on September 22, 1976, without even being born or experienced the season. The effect was instantaneous and that moment catapulted the trio Kate Jackson, Jaclyn Smith and Farrah Fawcett especially the success and level of sexual symbols. There was not a pretty thought, and many were the order of women who wanted to have their hair Farrah. The show had 5 seasons and ran from 1976 until 1981.Almost 20 years later, we see three beautiful girls and talented of the new generation in a big-screen version of this phenomenon of the 70s, and the story is basically the same as the show. In the film we see three multitalentosas and intelligent detective, played here by the stunning redhead Drew Barrymore (Dylan), by descending irressistível Asian Lucy Liu (Alex) and the beauty of the current film, Cameron Diaz (Natalie), who work for a detective agency under the command of his boss Charlie Townsend, who only know by voice, never revealing to its contractors. It is through Bosley (Bill Murray), Charlie goes tasks to their detectives. Contrary to the use of weapons and only using their martial arts skills, intelligence and sensuality, the Panthers, as they are known, are facing another challenge during the investigation of the kidnapping of billionaire Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), which can cause your company, Knox Technologies, lose millions of dollars, while having voice recognition software stolen by a rival of Knox, who recently tried to buy the company for Knox but the proposal was rejected. They go after the clues and as events progress, realize that in fact the enemy cannot be expected and that the goal of achieving everything was actually someone very important to the girls.Director McG, documentary Korn: Who Then Now?, And the short film Sublime, and later director of Terminator - Salvation is who was in charge of performing this adaptation, and ended up getting a nice final product, sensual and fun, without further commitments. The film begins with an important sequence that plan right away has the skills and shows how fearless are three girls in a great escape from the scene by air plane and a speedboat. In this sequence even already have the first auto movie reference, when the airplane passengers watch TJ Hooker - Movie and complain: ""One more feature film made from an old TV series."" Was there set the tone that the film would follow from that moment on, not taking too seriously.Then the protagonists are presented according to their characteristics in an interesting: Natalie is the girl always cheerful, clumsy, dreamy and romantic and loves to dance. Alex has always been more serious, intelligent and with great prominence in all sports and that it intended to do since childhood. Already Dylan has always been a ""rocker"", rebellious and easier to engage with men. The mode of action and physical differences were well differentiated, but the friendship of friends and how they are strong together is essential to understand here.What is interesting here, besides the numerous jokes, hilarious situations, and self-referrals are the influences of other recent productions such as Matrix-inspired slow motion entitled, juggling unimaginable bodily movements dodging balls, strikes in martial arts and speed effect when the shakes leaves the barrel of the gun, the Mission Impossible as in the scene where they invade the company Roger Corwin to deploy the device in the company's core mainframe so ""invisible"", and the films of James Bond . Even the idea of Jackie Chan to show errors Hilarious recordings during the closing credits are shown at the end.Some of the scenes are priceless referring more to the '70s, with the presence of some cars of the era, the soundtrack to many successes of the era, the dance number that Cameron Diaz stars in a nightclub. Others also are highlighted, and generally appears when Cameron. When she wakes up from the dream that is dancing, the way she dances alone and move your body just blouse and panties and finding the postman talking phrase dual leaving you awestruck by the beauty of the girl and the situation itself, is hilarious. The she answers the phone as it hits the bad guys during the rescue Bosley also worked very well, as well as his involvement with Pete (Luke Wilson).Drew Barrymore, who is also producer of the film, also participates in important scenes. His scenes with the character Chad (Tom Green) are great. Lucy Liu, you love to be serious, it was more on the action, but was much helped by Jason (Matt LeBlanc) which is excellent in the scenes where they are together. At the time, LeBlanc was at the height of the sitcom Friends playing Joey Tribbiani.Unfortunately, the producers could not come to an agreement to hire Panthers originals for small stakes. Left over from the old show just the concept, the faceless voice of Charlie, the same actor from the TV series, the late John Forsyth, and the theme song from Jack Elliott and Allyn Ferguson. We highlight the soundtrack to Edward Shearmur, editing efficient dual Peter Teschner and Wayne Wahrman and photography Russell Carpenter.For what is proposed, the film entertains divinely. We have action scenes of explosions, there juggling the Jackie Chan martial arts, trails, struggles, and more. With inspiration from numerous sources, McG had the chief merit of making it work the chemistry between the leading trio. Cameron, Liu and Barrymore complement each action scene, and explore other great sex appeal contained in each of the three beauties. It is difficult to imagine the Panthers current being represented by other girls. Even the disagreements between Lucy Liu and Bill Murray came to disrupt and not clear in the public at any time.Then forget the screenplay by John August overly simplistic, and Ryan Rowe Ed Solomon, totally predictable and full of easy solutions to the puzzles shown. Forget the laws of physics and rational and logical side and embark on wild action. By ""does not take seriously"" the movie ended up saving to be one of the worst of the genre. It pays to be with wounded, nor that it is only to fill the eyes with Cameron Diaz dancing in panties and wet clothes, or to see Drew Barrymore with a breathtaking neckline, or sultry Lucy Liu dressed as a Geisha massage clinic.",Charlie's Angels

McG tries to get some cool Matrix stunts in but it all doesn't hold together. Too much make up.Though, admittedly the Angels are hot just not believable as action heroines.

Charlie's Angels profits from their glee in this harmless joyride. The recent trend since The Brady Bunch movie is to make fun of the seventies by adapting a television show from the seventies. I, for one, hate this idea with a passion. Yes, the seventies are easy and fun to make jokes about, but why ruin beloved shows with pointless mockery. Charlie's Angels manages to stay away from this for the most part while still poking fun at the show a little. While the angels are fine, it is the villains that make the movie for me. Crispin Glover, Sam Rockwell, and Kelly Lynch dominate the angels in style. The fight scene between the thin man and the angels(set to Prodigy's ""Smack My B**ch up"") as well as the reveal of Sam Rockwell as the main villain(set to Marvin Gaye's ""Got To Give It Up"") rock. Drew Barrymore is hot, Cameron Diaz needs to get over her fascination with own butt, Bill Murray goes crazy, Luke Wilson remains the dull Wilson, and Tom Green should be shot.

Re-watched the movie today when I'm almost 30 and guess what? It still is. 
It's very infectious with fun and positive attitude.
This one movie has everything:
1. Ridiculous but competently shot action and stunts (some really good ones)
2. Beautiful ladies (yet a little oversexualized and objectified)
3. Tons of early 2000's cultural references. I mean, I felt like a kid again. Korn, Prodigy, Nokia, Tom Green, The Matrix, Mission Impossible, ""cool computer stuff"", you name it. This movie is so 2000s. 
4. 90% of the dialogue was just funny nonsense. Almost every line makes you say ""what?"".
It gets a little boring closer to the end, but it never gets too long anyway. Leaves you on a positive note though.

Their boss still is Charlie and his right man Bosley is played by Bill Murray. The plot line goes in the lines of: important software stolen, get it back, who did it. But that matters very little, as the movie has only one aim: to be as cool as it is humanly possible. And when it get tired of being cool it just starts throwing goof ball humor left and right.I honestly have trouble of reviewing this film as a real movie, as it obviously doesn't even try to be one, but then again what is a real movie.

The usual film from the Hollywood dull factory.  Hollywood seems to be obsessed with making successful television shows from the past into full length features.  Does not hold a candle to the action films of Michelle Yeoh, Anita Mui, Maggie Cheung, or Yukari Oshima.  Charlie's Angels(2000) is an unimaginative action film that fails to be good or creative.  Bill Murray can't even save this turkey with his appearence as Bosley.  The three actresses are average in their roles but are not action heroines that can have a larger than life quality.  For people who want to see something that has cult appeal and is dazzling than I suggest the films, Diabolik(1968), and The Heroic Trio(1992).",Charlie's Angels
90,Movie-12,"Good looking production, but pointless, mindless, and thoughtless. **1/2 (out of four)",6,6 February 2001,"CHARLIE'S ANGELS / (2000) **1/2 (out of four)""Charlie's Angels"" is a movie that wastes 98 minutes of your life without you realizing it until the closing credits role past. In the adaptation of the old sitcom of the same name, director Joseph McGinty Nichol fabricates an effective glossy style, a jayvee soundtrack, alluring costumes, convincing make-up and set designs, intriguing dialogue, cool cinematography, and a lively mood of comic adventure. The problem? The movie is pointless, underwritten, obvious and does not require the work of a single brain for you to watch.The film doesn't take a lot of time in introducing the whole concept of the Charlie's Angles attitude. The film is based on the popular television program, and it is clear the filmmakers try to be faithful and authentic to the series, but judging by the character development and seemingly spacious motives, it really would not matter if there was a basis for re-writing of the material or not.The movie stars a gifted cast, with Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, and Cameron Diaz taking the title roles as Dylan, Alex, and Natalie. They are three sexy private investigators working for a mysterious man by the name of Charlie, whose identity is kept a secret. Charlie's front man, Bosley (Bill Murray), assigns the three agents to investigate the kidnapping of Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), the founder of Knox Technologies. Knox recently invented an extremely accurate identification program, and the company's president, Vivian (Kelly Lynch) believes his old rival (Tim Curry) is responsible for the kidnapping.When you have a movie like ""Charlie's Angles,"" why even bother with the plot when it consists of a series of stylized action scenes linked together by a lame excuse for a story. Several of the action sequences are entertaining and exciting, and the ending is kind of amusing in its cheesy sort of way, but you will not see a scene this year as ridiculous as the fight sequence where the three heroes battle a man in a dark ally. What is with ""The Matrix"" styled material? It makes us wonder what kind of powers these girls behold.""Charlie's Angels"" is wonderfully cast, from the leading actress trio to supporting roles from Tim Curry, Luke Wilson, Tom Green, Matt LeBlanc, and LL Cool J, the cast often makes the movie's eye candy more swallowable. But the action is all over the board here. There is no focus or direction to the film's endless boundaries. If it was better directed, maybe ""Charlie's Angels"" would have turned out to be more than mindless fist fights and glossy imagery.",Charlie's Angels
91,FlickJunkie-2,Heavenly fun,8,9 April 2001,"Action adventure has probably never been this much fun.  This comedy sendup of the 1970's TV series has a plot as flimsy as Cameron Diaz's outfits, but who cares!  It gives us inane comedy interwoven with serious action, making it wonderfully mindless entertainment.From a technical standpoint, the film is first rate.  First time feature director Joseph McGinty Mitchell (McG) who has won numerous awards for music and commercial videos seems unfazed by this gargantuan project ($92 million budget).  Though the film is done in a hodgepodge of styles (a hallmark of video directors), each is extremely well done, using locations, color and sets imaginatively and effectively.  The pace, like McG himself, is like a frenetic roller coaster ride and the humor generally works.Probably the most impressive elements of the film are the fighting scenes. Diaz, Barrymore and Liu all trained tirelessly on the wire to produce fabulously athletic fighting scenes that look authentic.  The editing of these scenes is outstanding and when you see them, it seems that Cameron Diaz really can jump eight feet in the air, travel ten yards and kick her foe in the face three times!  There is an excellent behind-the-scenes feature on the DVD that shows how this was done.  This is only one of the many special features on this loaded DVD.  In addition, the DTS sound on the DVD is outstanding and explosive.The acting; well there is not a lot of serious acting going on here.  It is all very tongue in cheek and all three angels handle their roles with an excellent combination of sarcastic humor and sexiness.  Bill Murray is great as the twenty-first century Bosley.  Kelly Lynch is also delectably evil as Vivian rendering some good fight scenes herself.This film is a real crowd pleaser.  I rated it an 8/10.  It has terrific production values, great action, amusing humor and a killer cast.  With all this, who needs a story?",Charlie's Angels

Barrymore and Diaz were excellent, and Liu surprised me given her role in Ally McBeal.Bill Murray was also very good as Bosley, and the story managed to hold weight to the end.Worth a look without a doubt.",Charlie's Angels
93,cariart,"Once Upon a Time, there were 3 Little Girls...",8,14 November 2000,"As much a tribute to pop culture as a big-screen version of the '70s series, 'Charlie's Angels' has so much energy and tongue-in-cheek charm that it DARES you NOT to root for its three young stars! And while the film won't erase the images of Farrah Fawcett in a thin tanktop on a very cold day, there is a wholesome sexiness and accessibility in Barrymore, Diaz, and Liu that none of the various teamings of TV 'Angels' ever achieved!The pre-title sequence is outrageous, and fabulous! A mad bomber onboard a passenger jet meets his 'contact', a black terrorist in native dress, while watching 'T.J. Hooker - The Movie'(!) Grabbing the bomber, the terrorist crashes through an emergency exit; in free fall, the struggling pair are joined by skydiving Lucy Liu, who tears the bomb away, and hurls it, exploding, into the ocean, then does a controlled chute landing onto a speedboat piloted by Cameron Diaz. The black terrorist then drops, via a hidden chute, onto the boat, rips out a voice scrambler and removes a latex mask (a la 'Mission Impossible 2'), and a perfectly coiffed Drew Barrymore is revealed! The trio zooms, laughing, into the opening credits!
Each Angel has a unique backstory...Natalie (Diaz) is an upbeat 'Soul Train'-dancing wannabe who 'shakes her booty' at home in Spider-Man undies, looks for 'Mr. Right', and is a crack driver; Alex (Liu) is a 'leg waxer'/extra on an action movie set, who is a lousy cook, sleeps with the film's star (Matt LeBlanc, in a funny cameo), and is an expert in high-tech gadgets; Dylan (Barrymore) is an ex-high school 'bad girl'/free spirit involved with a seedy, insecure hippie living in a tugboat (humorously portrayed by Tom Green, Barrymore's real-life boyfriend), is a master of disguise, and martial arts.As in the TV series, the Angels work out of the Townsend Detective Agency (still located in the famous colonial brick building), and communicate with the never-seen Charlie (voiced, as always, by John Forsythe) via the telephone. As the trio's liason, Bosley, Bill Murray is simply perfect, hilarious in his patented 'smarmy but lovable' persona!
The plot revolves around the kidnapping of a Bill Gates-type computer genius (Sam Rockwell, 'The Green Mile'), and a technology that can pinpoint any person's location, anywhere in the world. The prime suspects are competitor Roger Corwin (Tim Curry, in a delightfully wicked turn!), and his hitman, portrayed with kinky relish by Crispin Glover. Hired by Kelly Lynch (who has a ball in the role of Rockwell's partner!), the Angels embark on a case with all the twists, action, humor, and mayhem that a fan could ask for!
Loud, good-natured, and pulsating with a soundtrack of '70s-'80s Top Ten songs, the film combines 'Matrix'-style freeze-frames and slow-motion FX with a ton of Pop Culture references and a swashbuckling sense of derring-do! The film literally rocks, and never lets up!
Is this 'Great Cinema'? Certainly not! But in its sheer audacity, and sense of fun, no recent film can match it! And while the original series teased with a visual sex appeal that was was largely ignored in the storylines, the big-screen version has a 'if you got it, flaunt it' attitude that is both refreshing and empowering! This is a 'Girl Power' movie, in the BEST sense of the word!I HIGHLY recommend it!",Charlie's Angels

What a farfetch'd movie. Bill Murray was OK and Cameron Diaz was a little OK but everybody else were either bad at acting or just couldn't make it up. The action is totally unrealistic and very fake. All I have to say good about Charlie's Angles is that most of the women were hot even Drew Barrymore.

It was a pretty good show in the beginning until all the cast changes turned the show into a dud. Now we have the movie version of ""Charlie's Angels"". And the result: it's an average picture with good and bad qualities. The good stuff: the three actresses who play the title characters. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu are three of the most joyful actresses around, and their presence in ""Charlie's Angels"" is about as good as it can get. They flat out make this film watchable. There are also amusing bit parts in the film featuring LL Cool J, Matt LeBlanc, and Barrymore's real-life ex-beau and current beau, Luke Wilson and Tom Green. But there were some things that disappointed me about ""Charlie's Angels"". First off, the villains in this picture were dull. Second of all, some (not all) of the action scenes were kind of distracting and looked sloppily done. And last, Bill Murray. Here is one of our funniest actors having appeared in such hilarious films as ""Ghostbusters"", ""Stripes"", ""Caddyshack"", ""Scrooged"", and ""What About Bob?"". But he comes off disappointing here in this movie. He's not real bad in ""Charlie's Angels"". He does have a few good moments from time-to-time.

I never expect too much when I push play - dated technology, limited acting skills, watered-down scripts for mass appeal, etc... But, often these old films are surprisingly well-made, especially considering the limitations of the era.This is a terrible movie. Surprisingly terrible. How, you might ask, does a project with this cast, with over 30 versions of the script to choose from, and with this massive budget, become such a terrible film? I don't have a great answer, although art majors could write doctoral theses about this colossal failure. I guess poor judgement and a lack of attention to detail are mostly to blame. The Cameron Diaz Soul Train scene is not funny, makes no sense, is embarrassing, and might be racist. The idea that anyone, ANYONE, would approve that scene in the final cut speaks to the poor judgement of EVERYONE involved. Cameron Diaz should have had more self respect and should be ashamed of herself, and 'McG' (whoever the **** that is) should have been tar and feathered, old school style.This should have been a sexy, fun film. Instead, as I watch a body double in flesh colored bra and granny panties fall out of a window of the Jetson's house, and roll down a cliff without injury, and magically turn back into a nude (but covered) Drew Barrymore, I am just irritated that my intelligence continues to be insulted and my time continues to be wasted.

100,chrisbrown6453,Can anyone say Franchise?,9,20 July 2001,"Featuring a killer soundtrack, some amazing stunts and special effects, and some bad ass babes, Charlie's Angels is destined to become a very lucrative franchise. Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu head up the cast of a very cool, very stylish film that has all the markings of a summer film, but in the fall. The three Angels are an elite fighting force run by a reclusive millionaire named Charlie. Lead by their boss Bosley (Bill Murray), the ladies are always trying to save the world from disaster. The movie starts with an opening sequence that would make James Bond blush, with a midair parachute chase and explosion. We get a little but of a back story of the girls, but nothing too specific. Then the story kicks in. It seems as if a famous software company's owner has been kidnapped by a rival. The plan is to combine the two forces and create a system that can track any person in the world, by their voice and their phone. The Angels are recruited to help find the company owner and foil the plot. But with a somewhat predictable plot turn, everything gets flipped upside down, and soon the Angels are fighting for their own lives, as well as the lives of Bosley and Charlie.
I'm thinking plot isn't a huge issue in this movie. The movie is all about explosions, fighting, killer outfits, and of course, the Angels. Right from the start, if you don't like Diaz, Barrymore or Liu, you aren't going to like this film. Their personalities are what carry the movie. I find them all pretty likeable, and of course extremely attractive. But director McG makes sure that even on the off chance you don't like the girls, there is a lot more going on to keep you involved. The fight scenes are straight out of The Matrix (and in the case of the first fight scene, better) with all three ladies involved in kicking some ass. A lot of slow motion martial arts sequences are used to make it seem cooler, and there's enough cheesy dialogue to rival a Schwarzenegger film. The Angels all play to character as well. Diaz is the cute hot one who doesn't realize how good she looks. She's just very likeable, even when she's in positions she shouldn't be in (such as the Soul Train scene). Liu is the hard-edged girl who looks like she could kick anyone's ass, and generally gets the tougher jobs in the film. And Barrymore is the slightly ditzy girl who seems to jump into bed with almost anyone (including her real life boyfriend Tom Green in a strange cameo appearance). But it's also not a situation where the girls are just eye candy. All of them are very strong physically and mentally. They all seem like the kind of girls you'd like to hang out with, and at the same time the kind of women that could beat you up in a heartbeat. Nice combination. One great thing about this movie is that it never lets up. I don't remember any time in this movie where there wasn't something going on. A lot of times there is an unnecessary romance that takes up time, or sad parts that take away from the action, but here it was non-stop the entire way through. Yes they threw in some down time, but never for more than a minute. The movie also had a very slick look to it. Very stylish but not over the top comic book hero type style. And the soundtrack was very cool. Whether the music was just in the background, or helping to describe and add to the scene, every song had a purpose. Sometimes music isn't supposed to be in the forefront of a movie, but in these types of all out action films, music helps pump up the audience, and makes the action on the screen that much better. The only things I would have liked to see were a little more of Bill Murray and his comic genius, and a bit more on the background of the Angels. Murray is easily one of the funniest men in film today, but his role was small and his comic talents were kept under wrap. And while I did enjoy the fact that the movie kicked into high gear from the start and kept it up throughout the film, I think a little bit more about how the Angels came to be would have been nice. Maybe in the sequel. So overall I enjoyed Charlie's Angels. It had some great action, some funny moments, a great soundtrack and three hot ladies. Great mindless entertainment for these cold days of winter. I'm looking forward to seeing more of the Angels, and some more work from McG.",Charlie's Angels

Natalie, Alex, and Dylan's characteristics are distinct and unique but complementary to one another. A script writer does a good job delegating personalities to each character. Also the actors, Barrymore, Diaz, and Liu carried out those roles with charm, charisma, and beauty, proving that a woman can be a strong and independent individual.3. The existence of Charlie. The plot is bland, but this mysterious Charlie adds the sense of mystery, more dimensions to the story, and another point of view to look at the movie.Weakness1. Storyline. Bland, simple, and blah.. but easy I guess. I enjoy the movie without too much focus, hints, or messages.2. It would've been better if I saw more of three women's talent and skills rather than seduction to solve the case. Secret agents disguise and use sex appeal but more of brains and intellects. I suggest this because this move is already feminist movie with great women empowerment.",Charlie's Angels

How embarrassing it is to see those lame presentations of so-called ""strong women""? How watching Cameron Diaz dancing half naked, bra-less, in her underpants and telling the mailman he can put the stuff into her slot - doesn't go hand in hand in delivering that message?

The film is over before realizing and that's due to its videoclipstyle as there isn't one minute left for serious words, it's all glimmer and glitz (says enough about Superman V, the next movie that will be directed by McG). Of course it's all based on that series from the 70's...three girls do what they're told to do by some invisible multimillionaire called Charlie and this time the client who asked the help from Charlie has to get Charlie himself as he killed his dad in some war. The ladies are brilliant and not one moment that I could keep my eyes off Cameron Diaz and Murray does what he is famous for : being an idiot...

And the best thing about it is that it doesn't try to be anything more or less than just a grand ol' time.I ought to clarify myself there.  An interesting phenominon I've noticed is that a lot of movies start out being just for fun.  Then about midway through or so, whoever's in charge decides to hit the audience over the head with a Message or something.  ""Ferris Buellar's Day Off"" is a good example. (Don't get me wrong, I love that movie as much as anyone, but what's the deal with Cameron's nervous breakdown at the end?)""Charlie's Angels"" doesn't pretend to have a message.  It's just good, clean, check-yer-brains-at-the-door fun.  Thank goodness for it!By the way, just because I feel the need to address this, be forwarned that the scenes with Tom Green and Drew Barrymore just raise a lot more questions than they answer.

Charlie's private investigation company is addressed by programmer Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), owner of Knox Technologies, whose revolutionary voice-recognition software has been stolen. Charlie's Angels Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) are sent to place a bug in the system of bitter rival Roger Corwin (Tim Curry), who is under strong suspicion. But after the deed is done, the Angels and their boss Bosley (Bill Murray) face the fact of a destroyed home base as well as Charlie's life in immediate danger. But how do you protect someone you never met? One thing a little weird about Drew Barrymore's character in this movie is that she falls for the guys that turn out to be the bad guys. This is yet another movie that is based on a TV-series movie classic along with Wild Wild West, Starsky and Hutch and Mission Impossible. I also liked at the credits when they where showing the bloopers! After this they made sequel that came out in 2003 which was another success! Action filled and funny too!

The three ladies knew how to use their sex appeal and talent to work things out and get away with the thugs along the way.I remembered my father at times mentioned about the original TV series's version because he did watched it when it was on air here.

110,SamJamie,Fun & Campy.,8,14 February 2020,"Charlie's Angels is a 2000 American action comedy film directed by McG, and written by Ryan Rowe, Ed Solomon, and John August. It is the first installment in the Charlie's Angels film series, a continuation of the television series of the same name created by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, which is also a continuation of the series story. Unlike the original series, which had dramatic elements, the film features more comical elements.Charlie's Angels is not a perfect film by any means, but that is what makes it so much fun. The three leads are fantastic together and much superior to the new leads we got in 2019. The film is nostalgic and fast-paced and there is never a dull moment. The film is like marmite, some will hate it, some will love it!",Charlie's Angels
111,Stompgal_87,"My teenage obsession packed full of action, eye candy and laughs",10,6 December 2013,"I vividly remember this film being publicised and Destiny's Child's 'Independent Women Part 1' being in the charts as well as clips from this film being featured in the video when I was 13. I wanted to see this film when it was out in the cinemas but I couldn't see it then because I was too young due to its 15 certificate in the UK (strangely enough, it's a 12 in Ireland and a PG-13 in America) but when I was 14, my mum hired the DVD and I watched it under her supervision due to its violent content, meaning I was okay. Finally when I turned 15, I received the DVD for my birthday, that complemented my PS2 perfectly, and I'd watch it every day after school to write down the script, much to my sister's annoyance and frustration. I still have that DVD and I also found the film on LoveFilm Instant. After having watched it for the first time in a while, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it just as much as I did as a teenager.I'd already heard of Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore when this film came out but this was the first time I'd ever heard of Lucy Liu, all of whom played the Angels perfectly with their high-octane stunts, numerous disguises and active leading roles, especially Diaz as Natalie, my favourite Angel who I found the funniest with her laugh-out-loud lines and superb dance moves, whether in her dream or against a Soul Train replica stage. The story was gripping and dramatic, especially when the Angels discover that Eric Knox's kidnapping was a set-up and have to get their Bosley back. The lines are mostly fun if a bit silly yet memorable while the soundtrack is very good and I also have that on CD. Not only did the film's soundtrack feature songs that were on CD but also songs that were not on it (e.g. Michael Jackson's 'Billie Jean' and Blur's 'Song 2') and snippets of incidental music consisting of various arrangements of the 'Charlie's Angels' theme tune plus some eerie, powerful and tense pieces. A lot of hard work and effort were put in the stunts and action scenes, the film is somewhat fast-paced and some of the special effects are incredible, especially the camera zooming into the cloudy sky of the Columbia logo before cutting to a plane flying against a real sky and the slow-motion bullet Knox fires when the moment he shoots Dylan out of the window is replayed. Afterwards, Dylan rushes towards a house where two boys are playing a computer game and she asks them for help, that house being the one featured in 'E.T. The Extra Terrestrial' in which Barrymore starred when she was a little girl. I was so impressed with the leading ladies' roles in this film that it prompted me to watch other works of theirs such as Diaz in 'There's Something About Mary,' Liu in 'Ally McBeal' and Barrymore in '50 First Dates.' This film also inspired me to write a spin-off television episode that was based on the Simpsons episode 'Trilogy of Error' as well as a crossover story in which the Angels meet Shrek (the titular character of yet another brilliant Diaz movie). While this film has several mistakes as listed on the likes of Slipups.com and Movie Mistakes.com, they were still fun to spot and were saved by the humour and the action sequences. The outtakes at the end were a laugh as well.Overall, this is an amazing girlie action flick that features memorable dialogue, stunning stunts, fantastic special effects and a superb soundtrack. I also recommend the sequel, 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,' which is even better. 10/10.",Charlie's Angels

The first time I saw it when I was 13 & I thought it was kick-ass at the time. But now, I'm 20 & the plot was not that interesting to me. All I could think about was how exploited these girls were while making the film. They had fun I am sure, but they exposed themselves so much. Still, its fun for a one time watch. I still haven't seen Charlie's Angels 2, maybe it will be better than this. But if IMDb rating is anything to go by, this is better than that. I hope its wrong, because it could be so much more fun. Charlie's face wasn't even shown. I am curious as to might he be. Maybe Full Throttle will give the answers.Cameron Diaz's recent My Sister's Keeper was awesome & her best performance was in that.

The women were sexy, there was no plot to get in the way and even the makeup was appropriately cute after the explosions  just the right amount of shadow in exactly the right places to accentuate the actresses' faces.There is no deep thought or greatness here  but real laughs and fast and entertaining action.  The sound editing is especially good.This film is what `Mission Impossible: II' should have been and was not.It did rely a little too heavily on the super-slow-motion sequences that `Matrix' created; but it was fast, furious fun.The only parts that seemed to drag were when Tom Green was on-screen  the rest of the time it moved quickly with the requisite number of explosions, fight scenes and fast cars that any action film should have.I was pleasant surprised at the chemistry between the three leading women of the film:  Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, and Cameron Diaz.  They work together well and complement each other's talents  I want to see more of them working together  and I have the feeling I will be.I hope that the inevitable sequel will have the style, action, pace and lack of plot this film had  I anticipate it eagerly.",Charlie's Angels

Lots of my friends speak about how this is a childhood favorite but honestly it isn't all its lead up to be. There are a few positives but also a fair few negatives.Positives:
Cast is hugely filled with A-listers and their characters are mostly interesting and funny at times.the fight scenes are a bit over the top but pretty cool and they dont have the usual 1v1 fight with 10 goons which is good to seethe gadgets/ props are really cool and creativethe plot on paper is interestingNegative:
the director has a extra Chromosome and did a terrible job with what should have been a interesting story with a huge cast.the writing/dialog isn't great and I found myself not being engaged in their convos. They also have super cheesy work around to situations which is lazy writinga huge one is how misogynistic and overly sexual this film is. It feels like the whole film is just a soft porno which is irritating (this coming from a straight 21y/o man.)the cgi/green screening is also quite bad and hasnt aged well at all.Overall:
This film is not great by any stretch with most problems being due to the director, poor characterization and over serialization that takes away from the good cast and decent idea of a story. Overall I probably wouldn't reccomend you'd watch this unless high or very very bored. 5/10 it was pretty average.",Charlie's Angels
119,danielll_rs,Against all odds it's pretty good,6,17 February 2001,"CHARLIE'S ANGELS (2000) *** Directed by McG. Starring: Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, Bill Murray.CHARLIE'S ANGELS is the kind of movie that seems to be a miracle- it had everything to go wrong... but (surprise!) it is pretty fine indeed. Yes, I was also not trusting at CHARLIE'S ANGELS, but I was pleasantly surprised. See my situation: I never liked the TV series very much. It was fun, but the three leads, especially Farrah Fawcett, didn't know how to act. Maybe it took itself too seriously. What happens in the movie is just the opposite- it doesn't take itself seriously in any moment, so we can accept all the implausible scenes (there are many of them).Much of my praise go to the three leads, who make us forget how Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson, and after that Cheryl Ladd and others, were so sexy-but-bland. Surprisingly, Drew Barrymore is the best of them. She can fight extremely well, acts well as Dylan and makes fun of herself (playing a bad girl turned into a good girl). It's great when she falls naked (!) on the same yard of her house in E.T! Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz don't stay behind. The first one shines as Alex, the brilliant girl who can't cook, while the latter is Natalie, a clumsy but smart girl who talks on the cell phone while defeating the bad guys. Not to talk that all of them look very, very, very good. Bill Murray, as Bosley, doesn't need presentations.A great thing are the fight sequences. Drew Barrymore, who was also a co-producer, forbid the use of guns, so the three angels have to use their muscles to defend themselves and defeat the bad guys. In fact, these sequences are kind of ironic, shamelessly copied from THE MATRIX (when a bullet is shot against Drew Barrymore and it makes the same movement of the bullets in THE MATRIX, we have no doubt).So you may ask what's their mission? In the movie, they apparently have to rescue a genius of the computers. But their mission is to make you have fun... and it works marvelously! So despite the usual plot holes and implausible situations, and the over-the-top direction by McG, an MTV son, put in your mind that this is not a work of art, but a big budget Hollywood flick, more uncompromising than most. CHARLIE'S ANGELS is pretty good: it has some hilarious lines, very funny scenes, great fight sequences, a fun soundtrack, sexy and gorgeous three leads, it's charming and colorful, and there's even a place for an unexpected plot twist. This film won't win any awards or save the world, but it will save you from a boring weekend.",Charlie's Angels

It's a simple plot, actually the plot is meaningless, simple action, just the type of movie in which you have to turn your brains off and just let them entertain you.But the rest is great. The stunts are amazing, the action scenes are great, the actors play surprisingly good, and the debutant director McG does a very good job. This is the perfect action-comedy film. It can't get any better than this.

Also add a few 'Mission Impossible' elements and there you have it.The plot is about a kidnapping with a twist (as expected) accompanied by a number of irrelevant, boring and totally stupid scenes. I wish I could find a more sophisticated way to say it, but the movie is stupid unless you're 8 years old. Also, was it necessary to make the girls act like whores?

The three foxy ladies of Charlie's detective agency are on the case getting caught up in a variety of hi-jinx that eventually puts all of them in mortal danger, and even threatens the life of their boss, the demure and debonair Charlie himself.Three little girls went to the police academy, their they were assigned very strenuous activities. However, I took them away from all that. And then, I was bought up by Drew Barrymore's production company to be made into this piece o' cr*p! This has to be one of the worst blockbuster's ever made, the women perform a variety of Matrix moves that happen for absolutely no reason apart from the fact that, er, the producers wanted them in there. Cameron Diaz dances in her pants, should be sexy, but comes off as actually quite sad, kind of like a man wearing a Borat style thong, as it seems a bit desperate really, which, for a film which is supposed to be about female empowerment, is just pathetic. Bill Murray clearly wishes he'd seen more of the script before signing on the dotted line and ghosts through the movie, although to be fair to his skills, his scenes in this production are one of the only good things in it, his scene in prison and with the sumo suits is great, but he seems to be wishing that someone would find money enough to make ""Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Lost in Translation"" in order to rescue him from films like this.And for me, this is the biggest travesty of this film, that with a cast that includes Cameron Diaz, Bill Murray, Sam Rockwell (Great in ""Galaxy Quest"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"", here ...Dismal!) and the completely underrated Tim Curry, that such an apocryphal film should be made. Tim Curry is always underused, and both Sam Rockwell and Bill Murray's careers managed to survive this disaster, but in many ways this has had a devastating impact on Cameron Diaz's career. Before this she was arguably one of the most sought after light comedy performers in Hollywood, with a string of good performances from ""The Mask"" through to ""Soemthing about Mary"" with glimpses of more depth with ""The Last Supper"" and ""Being John Malkovich"", however since these dismal outings she has largely become known as that woman that Justin Timberlake went out with and that great potential that she displayed not long ago now seems woefully underused.That this is so high a score on IMDb is a travesty to justice and an indictment to the power of advertising and hype as, like the Policeman said, there really is nothing to see here!

The other 2 are woefully out of place: Drew Barrymore, a co-producer, is chubby, bloated in the face, and un-pretty. Lucy Liu, older than the other two by at least 5 years, is too petite and looks un-comfortable in the part. Bill Murray hasn't much to play against as Bosley, and fades into the background. John Forsythevocalizes Charlie again, now with a creaky-sounding 80-year-old voice. The villains are inconsequential, paving the path for routine multiple explosions.

Some rate it quite high; some don't, mainly or maybe because they didn't understand the movie as they should. Truth is that Charlie's Angels is already a classic, no one can deny it. Hit stroke the blockbuster list, profited millions, and are rare those who don't know who the angels are. We look at Diaz (already a star, and one of my favorites!) and remember her cleavage sexy suits, her stunt acrobacies, and her in jokes. We look at Barrymore and is impossible to forget her danced choreographed fights and her nude scene (so much for innocence in ET!), and every time Ally MacBeal airs, all of us know that one of them is an Angel  Lucy, this is yours. Having said that, lots of expectations were surrounding the project: big budget, big stars, effects and successfully adapting an old TV Series is not an easy job. The chances of failure were enormous, first time director, an over written script, but after all it proved otherwise. Director McG did a great job, giving the movie a music video look, that was the exact choice here, the screenplay was great, full of jokes and twists (some predictable) but anyway, it is not surprising, since Ed Solomon (Men In Black) was behind it. Is the movie new? No. Are there reasons why this movie should be loved? Yes. Are there reasons why this movie should be hated? No. Is it good? Awesome, actually. Did it work? Of course it did. Charlie's Angels was a surely refreshing movie to see, the Angels were all great at their own way, the supporting cast was also hilarious (only Tom Green and is Chad could have been expendable), it has also a great villain, Sam Rockwell is great, having the right measures of charm, irony and anger. The soundtrack is also great. Drew Barrymore shined on the fighting scene with the hands tied. Lucy Liu was hilarious as the domineering leather business woman at the Red Star meeting. Cameron Diaz was hilarious in, hum, pretty much everything. She was the best Angel. Also it is impressive that she also looks beautiful and hot in every disguise. We'll, I can't keep on writing forever, although the movie leads me to it, I can't say there is a single thing I would change from it.

They are so outlandish in possibility that they reach the level of being cartoonish. While the three ""Angels"" follow the idea behind James Bond of being capable of doing everything from driving a race car to climbing buildings to flying a helicopter, the fight scenes are Kung Fu in nature with wild twists, turns and hits that violate the laws of physics applied to the human form.
The story is also not that great, the premise is that a set of two rings containing the encrypted information regarding the people in the federal witness protection program is sought by the evil characters. They will stop at nothing to acquire them and so everyone associated with the attempt to acquire or retain them is at risk.
One of the male opponents of the Angels is some form of super being whose powers are never explained. While he is a superb physical specimen, that would not protect him from being injured by fire.

129,jamiecostelo58,The angels have fallen (big time),1,12 December 2006,"I was optimistic about this adaptation of the classic 70s and 80s show, but on first viewing, it did nothing but disappoint. This movie is simply too over the top, and the 'funny' moments are quite laboured.Great karate moves and special effects are spoilt by the weak storyline and a ridiculous performance from Bill Murray. Nice to hear John Forsythe reprise the role of Charlie though.A shame that one of the men responsible for the original TV series had a hand in producing a poor adaptation. Why did Leonard Goldberg bother? Original star Kate Jackson also commented on how the film failed to capture the spirit of the TV series: I see her point immensely.This movie is a poor excuse for something that is supposed to be based on a legendary TV series. It is simply ridiculous and over the top nonsense that is absolutely nothing to get excited about.",Charlie's Angels
130,maxmages,Fetis movie!,3,25 August 2018,"It's not so much a movie as a collection of pretty women dressed in strange costumes who are supposed to cover some of the charms.
It's like a PG 13 version Russ Meyer or as if someone had created a cinematic parody on Totally Spies.just well ... you know ... just not good.I do not know what the bigger ordeal is either the constant cartoon sound effects that for some reason completely override serious scenes of the movie that absolutely add to the strangeness of acting or the way too colorful colors and fast scene changes that were clearly inspired by music videos and only Cause strain on the eyes
But if I had to decide right away, I would say the high cringe factor that stretches across the entire movie like a red thread could cause some viewers to burst their veins. I also feel sorry for all the actors who have to play in this junk because that's a pretty good cast almost allstar cast and it's sad that this movie is one of their best known.Where the actresses and the great costumes can be seen in the film nothing happens except that a character in a provocative disguise rips somewhere the other two are in the background we are turned on for a few minutes then it goes to the next place and the whole thing happens again with one of the other three women characters.I have little idea of the original TV series but I doubt that was a decent adaptation if the series was not so good from the beginning and is therefore unsuitable for a movie adaptation.
in some places it seems like one of those exaggerated films that are supposed to cast a satirical view of the original, but that's not cartoony enough, for a good adaptation of the original it's not serious enough, for an action comedy writer it's neither exciting nor funny enough for a Guilty Pleasure, the movie is not erotic enough for a Guilty Pleasure, the movie is not over the top and embarrassing enough and for a good movie, the movie is not good enough.",Charlie's Angels

Having said that, it's a pretty fun movie with lots of silly plot twists and over-the-top characters, some good gags and some great talent (Crispin Glover makes a particularly cool villain, and Bill Murray is as awesome as ever) and of course there's plenty of pretty young ladies falling out of their costumes.

There was no ""secret organization"", but a normal detective agency where the Angels worked out of. They weren't tramps, but serious professionals of law enforcement who were discriminated against due to gender... But they were the top of the top.In this remake, it seems that you had 2 rejects (an airhead and a slut), and one somewhat normal person (Liu's character) brought together for the team. Sorry, but I didn't buy it. Yeah, in the fights they were interesting, but the mental state of the characters were silly. Instead of a salute to a classic series, we ended up with a weak parody. The only returning person was John Forsythe as Charlie. Guess he needed the money.Bill Murray was interesting, as well as the villain. The story idea wasn't bad. I would even say it had a nice twist.

No Oscar nominations here!But the movie is a brilliant pop-corn affair  highly entertaining, visually pleasing, matrix/crouching tiger style action and brilliant corny, campy comedy.It's directed by a music video director - McG (probably not his real name!) and it is shot in a music video style  heaps of unique scenes with contrasting colours, costumes and settings.I would check this baby out if you want a film that isn't hard on the grey matter  8 out of 10!",Charlie's Angels

If the situation was bad before this came out, it turned completely upside down with the new Charlie's Angels: the same unseriousness that was peculiar to Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, was revitalized by the new edition of rocking super chicks.To some people the best from angels is like the worst from James Bond, but I'd heavily suggest contrary interpretation. There is no use to go back into original angels, who were more ""angelic"" than these ones, but instead, by creating new angels that are modelled after contemporary idea of more superficial heroines, we get rid of the junk that the whole action genre has been producing during last few decades with the worst actors in Hollywood. Even if this is morally not the best way to improve modern cinema, the creative destruction of these angels, or Charlie's Demons, has an impact that will eventually twist the crap out of the whole action genre.",Charlie's Angels

This is the adolescent male's idea of women's liberation and the entire movie feels as though it were scripted by a 13-year-old boy.The actors do well with what they are given, and you can catch a few entertaining cameos and two or three funny moments, but that's about it. The special effects from the Matrix are extremely overused and began to approach the point of satire by the end of the movie.  At least in The Matrix, all that 3-D stop/start gravity-defying fighting made sense in the context of the film.  Here, you are left to believe that somehow the laws of physics are suspended around the three 'detectives'.  Cameron Diaz manages to stay suspended longer than Michael Jordan and still deliver a kick that bowls over Crispin Glover, who thankfully is given almost no dialogue. Actually, that very fact led me to rate this movie a 4 instead of a 3.Let's hope that Cameron gets back to making almost anything else, Drew finds roles that equal or surpass her work in ""Ever After"" and ""Wedding Singer"", and Lucy Liu goes back to oblivion where she belongs, and takes Tom Green with her.",Charlie's Angels

Cameron Diaz was just hilarious as Natalie, she did a really great job.

Now, kids watching TV at home with their pals have a fair good chance of seeing a fighting fit, butt naked woman falling on their courtyard to borrow their bicycle and T-shirt... Wow! You'll understand this comment when you watch this movie - that is a less a remake of the TV series of the same name than a witty, humourous parody of sci-fi and spy movies, with lines and scenes that'll bring some of the best to your memory. Since the agents are three female, the main villains are adequately three, two male and one female, providing for a climactic end sequence where the heroines battle it out to an explosive climax (pun intended) with them. This way, unlike many movies that promise and don't deliver, you're allowed to see spectacular hand-to-hand mixed and woman-to-woman battles. Those who cater for violence are certainly put off by the film's classification for teenager audiences, but that derives from the (excellent) choreography of the fights, and the humour that tempers the action. There's plenty, and much better photographed, fighting in this movie than any of those that premiered in the last couple of years. The villainess is as sexy, and durable as any of the heroines - making her more believable than others. Please don't start crying out loud in the theatre when you see the first couple of heroines dying a gory death! (Sorry! You SHOULD go see the movie anyway! I'm warning you...)

The 1st is the serious approach the 2nd is the fun approach.This film take the 2nd approach and succeed. The makers of the film seem to realize that with such a camp and trashy source they will kill themselves if they try to be serious. The result is a brain-less fun that mange to be entertaining while saluting the TV series. Part of the fun is the in jokes that the film has. The other part is the feeling that the everyone involved in the film had so much fun that it reflects on screen.The fight scene are good though I too had problems with Drew Barrymore's fight scene, however that didn't affect my enjoyment.Sometime we need some mindless fun.So if you look for a film with serious messages or meanings look somewhere else.

There are hot women who work in bikinis, lots of guns, a large software company with a ridiculously complicated security system...All the ingredients for fun, senseless, campy eye-candy.  And an awful, awful plot, of course. The best thing about the movie might have been the set.  A lot of work went into some of the scenes and how they were shot.

Like many people, what disturbed me most was what this movie seemed to be saying about a lot of real-life issues.  Like the original series, it's a complete mockery of feminism.  The movie is riddled with classic stereotypes.  Cameron Diaz is the dumb blonde.  Lucy Liu is the exotic, oriental, dragon lady that Hollywood loves to propogate so much.

146,Criticalstaff,The most 90s film ever,7,19 July 2021,"When future generations will ask about the zeitgeist around the turn of the millennium, they will look at this film. It is not funny enough to be a classic comedy and the action is pretty weak for an action film. However as a time capsule, it captures so much of Western mainstream popular culture of the late nineties. Just for that reason, I think it is highly culturally significant.The plot is almost non-existent and the whole movie has nothing to say or to contribute in any way shape or form to anything; the film is extremely superficial. Yet, it is so plastic that it becomes remarkable in itself. And it also recalls a quality that a lot of movie pre-Sopranos had. Movies used to be more empty and lighter in terms of fun. Of course these movies were forgotten or discarded like tears in the rain, and frankly this movie has been largely forgotten as well. But, there is enough genuine fun in this film that it remains watchable twenty years later. The song are cheesy and bad, but they are of that era. Which means that instead of being cool, most of the songs and the actions scenes that go with them are heavily cringy now. Which in turns makes it adorable. It is the movie version of a poster of Eminem or Britney Spears in your teenage room at your parents' house. It is immature and deeply embarrassing, but it is genuine and sweet at the same time.The movie is a succession of action scenes with needle-drops that are engaging at first but become rapidly overused and annoying. The plot is almost saved by the prescience of turning a nerdy tech billionaire into a soulless psychopath. Yet, the film is truly saved by the individual acting and the fact that most of the cast seems genuinely to have fun.If you have never lived through the nineties and seen how culture (and the world) changed in the following decade, this movie is of no interest. It will do nothing for you. But for people who did, this is like those pre-historic cave paintings, they are a carefully preserved reminder of who we were, what types of entertainment we valued, how we lived.Finally, I would like to point out that, when this movie came out and was successful, Hollywood had the idea of developing films into movie franchises. For now on, films series would be built like TV shows. Charlie's Angels the movies would be developed like, Charlie's Angels the show. Charlie's Angels is where this idea comes from, not X-men, not James Bond. This is the origin; this is the starting point of every Marvel movie, Planet of the Apes remake or Star Wars reboot.

Obvious use of flying wires in several scenes, and let's not forget that we MUST have repetitive, raucous music start up EVERY time the angels engage an enemy.

Those two words will register with anyone who grew up in the 70's, but the movie version is a treat, a pure popcorn movie that never slows down.The plot is utterly disposable, but that's part of the charm: You have the feeling Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu probably get more mileage out of an enterprise like this than a 'serious' movie. The film is a superb mix of three factors: 1. The almost-unbearable HOT-ness of the three lead actresses. 2. Adrenaline-pumping action scenes. and 3. Comedy.The action is cleverly staged by director McG, who is a veteran of music videos. Unlike most of the quick-cutting maniacs that have come out of the world of MTV, McG lets us *see* the action and he keeps wild cutting, noise, and incoherent violence to a bare minimum.All the actors perform well: You can't think of anyone else other than Diaz, Liu, or Barrymore for the Angels, Sam Rockwell is good, Kelly Lynch is a (female dog) on wheels (she and Diaz have a terrific fight scene late in the film), Bill Murray is Bosley, Crispin Glover is delightfully creepy as 'The Thin Man', and the invaluable Tim Curry is another villain (seeing him and Murray duke it out in sumo suits is hilarious).All things considered, 'Charlie's Angels' is a terrific ride that will leave you grinning.",Charlie's Angels

Not much to add except this...Any woman who is interested in strong female characters and real girl power should avoid this film at any cost as it will only insult her intelligence.The movie is a horridly failed attempt at being hip, exciting and fun. The soundtrack is way overdone and does not feature any original music, only tried-and-true chart hits which are swapped for other chart hits every other 10 seconds. Needless to say the film is quite tiresome.Apart from this music video-approach the movie shamelessly copies the Matrix bullet-time camera-work and fake kungfu by actresses who probably can't even beat a 12 year old karate student. All the ridiculous action scenes are completely over-the-top, which was probably intentional, but is equally annoying.Add (or subtract) to this the lame humour, the low believability in what is virtually no plot, and the complete lack of charm of the ladies, and what you have is a film that is a complete insult to the original show. The TV show might have been cheesy but at least it was far more entertaining with charming, beautiful women,who fought with their brains rather than with phoney martial art-moves.Go watch the TV-series and don't waste your time on this turd. 1/10",Charlie's Angels

It possessed a good mixture of script, fine visually creative directing and the cinematography and fight/action sequences get a firm thumbs up. Plenty of chemistry between not only the actors, but within all the main ingredients to bake a well worth ticket purchase. If you take it all a bit tongue in cheek, then I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride this film gives. Strong soundtrack that is used very well and the final edit with just the right pinch. Cameron just lit the screen up with that sunshiny smile of hers and that wonderfully wacky shtick she so innocently delivers. Yet the strongest performances came from a man of two and one that uttered not a word. Sam Rockwell, (Galaxy Quest) and Crispen Glover, (McFly of Back to the Future). I was excited to see how comic booky and sinister Crispen poured from this character. And Director McG caught the true essence he portrayed. Sam got a juicy opportunity to play the semi shy computer geek that turns to stud muffin psycho dude. And what a performance he gave. Spitting food on Drew was such a nice additive. Helped to give that character a bit more bite, as well as when he twirled that gun like a majorette on New Year's Day.For a film that didn't even have a finished script by first shot and was handled by no less then seven (count em) seven writers, (or is it eleven...)I'd say it was put together quite well. Expect a second installment, but don't think for an instant it'll come cheap! Guestamating...13mill for Diaz, 5 for Lucy Lui, probably 9mill for Drew plus some additional producer kick back. Oh, and I'm sure Murray will want his penny shined quite brightly. More then deserved I'm sure. Then McG will get a good upfront and back end deal not to mention the offers assuredly pouring in about to cramp that schedule of his. I guess for the upfront piece of the pie, around 45 million.

159,ericjg623,"Pure, delicious fun !!",9,2 June 2001,"I was amazed that Roger Ebert rated this a mere 1/2 star, since I normally find his reviews spot on. I mean, how can you NOT enjoy this movie? It is sheer, pure fun for 90 minutes, that was clearly the intention of the makers of this film and they delivered on every front. The girls look great, the soundtrack is wonderful (you know you're in for a wild ride when the opening scene has 2 of the Angels, along with a villain who has a bomb strapped to his chest, falling out of the sky over the California coast to the tune of Motley Crue's ""Live Wire""), the stunts and martial arts are terrific, The sets and locations are vivid and colorful, you've got action, you've got comedy, you've got sex appeal, what more can you ask for in the way of entertainment? There's no point to this movie, which is exactly the point. The plot is silly, but who cares? As with any decent Bond flick, you just sit back and go along for the ride. And in this case, the Angels play the role both of Bond, fighting evil with wits, style and physical bravado, and that of the Bond women, in terms of beauty and charm. Ebert wonders how these three actresses could have allowed themselves to be part of this movie, after seeing the film and watching the behind the scenes features on the DVD version, I can only ask ""how could they not?"" Perhaps he should acquaint himself with the 80's classic ""Girls just wanna have fun!""",Charlie's Angels
160,Philaura,The Angels were suppose to be BEAUTIFUL weren't they?,1,3 April 2001,"The thing I enjoyed about the TV series was that the gorgeous women paraded around in sexy clothes that showed off their assets.  A real eye candy sort of thing. Loved it.  This film took 3 women that I have seen appear to be beautiful in other films and made them look awful.  Carmen Diaz looked like a scarecrow she was so thin and her hair was so stringy and no makeup. Whoa - can't say I enjoyed going there.  Every now and then Drew Barrymore looked attractive, but not often enough to make a real show of it.  And I don't get the popularity of that third angel.  Her hair is nice I guess.  Bill Murray looked like a derelict.  Then there was the stunts. REALLY BAD.  At least I wasn't expecting much of a story and wasn't disappointed there.  Had to turn it off about 45 minutes into it.  There had to be something else better on TV.",Charlie's Angels
161,Denver53,"Interesting mix of action, humor and cheese",7,6 November 2000,"I liked Charlie's Angels more than I expected I would. The trailers and commercials painted a confusing picture of a movie that was based on a cheese-and-jiggle TV show yet looked like Mission Impossible: The Movie with three women as Tom Cruise. ""Surely,"" I thought, ""this movie can't be both and it will suffer as a result.""I was wrong. CA *is* both cheesy (but with a wink and a nod) and action-packed. Somehow it manages to be entertaining at the same time. Oh, the plot is silly and obvious and there are no surprises. But the three actresses win the viewer over with sheer exuberance and effort.
There are many clever touches in the film, which range from the way-over-played smoking bad guy (and his over-the-top menacing looks) to the goofy way the film replays earlier scenes to make sure the viewers ""got it"" when a key plot point is revealed. It's not like you need the replay, but it is humorous to see it pop up kind of like slo-mo replay in football games. Bill Murray is terrific as Bosley. He adds even more goofiness. And there are weird, unexplained touches such as a bad guy who looks like Dana Carvey in a 70s wig who apparently likes to dance when he is happily anticipating mayhem.The one thing that irked me, and it didn't irk me as much as it might have in a less cheesy movie, is the stupid ""Matrix-style"" fighting effects. In The Matrix, it was believable that the characters would leap nine feet in the air, kick two or three times, then flip over and perform another attack like some kind of steroid-enhanced kangaroo. That was because the Matrix world was a simulation and the characters could manipulate it with their minds. In CA, however, it is the ""real"" world. It is ridiculous to have people doing the things these girls (and some of the bad guys) do, when you know it is impossible. All those effects do is cause you to remember it's just a movie and you are watching special effects.Overall, I had a much better time than I thought I would at CA. Too bad the original angels were too snotty to appear in cameos. That would have been the cherry on top off this light-weight but funny sundae. We rated it a 7.",Charlie's Angels
162,Calysta,A fun blockbuster,8,28 November 2000,"CHARLIE'S ANGELS is the type of no-substance movie that guarantees an audience regardless of when the film debuts at the box office or whether the opening is marred with somewhat widespread critical panning. With the infamous stories of spite, jealousy and rivalry that emerged from the set during the past year, along with the three stars vying to wear the best scantily clad attire possible, this has in part fueled an increased awareness among the teenagers. Everyone else probably went along to compare the faithfulness of another TV/film adaptation, or to sigh at the possible ruin of yet another classic TV series. The movie seems to be built around stereotypes of the stars type cast persona, and surprisingly the screenplay seems to be doing all it can to back this up. If this film doesn't get Lucy Liu beyond her `Ally McBeal' credibility, or at least in terms of box office figures, it is hard to say what will. Her performance is definitely enjoyable, but once again, she seems to struggle past the dominatrix bitch that has probably influenced her film work since day one as Ling Woo. Yet she is the only Angel that can convince one of her suitability to the role. Cameron Diaz's transition to an action style flick hasn't allowed her to leave at home the familiar tricks of goofiness employed in `My Best Friends Wedding' with equally cringe-worthy scenes in both films and Drew Barrymore's heartfelt sincere moments seems to retread everything from `Ever After' to `Never Been Kissed.'Despite the comic implementation of Bill Murray, he seems to have few funny things to do, let alone lines to proclaim. While I enjoy Matt LeBlanc's performance on `Friends' for many weeks throughout each year, is it not possible to allow Joey Tribianni resting time during the film release season? If LeBlanc continues to reprise the dim actor in film appearances, it is likely that his movie career will become washed up after the comedy series comes to an end. It is probably Tom Green, Drew Barrymore's real life boyfriend delivers the goods in his hilarious and very welcome performance. The remainder of the film's characters seem to be hurriedly stolen ideas and spoofs of the quintessential film villain, which the screenplay makes no attempt to develop except in a abrupt change of pace that doesn't really work when culminated with false dramatics.Music video director McG has a somewhat coveted film debut with the popularity of the film at the box office. However, the surprisingly well executed action of the first thirty minutes of ANGELS begins to sag after this point, and never quite redeems itself even at climax. The opening credits of the film are in itself slotted together like a music video. Unfortunately, the light-hearted elements of the film are often a major let down, and are unfortunately few and far between, while I questioned whether or not I was obliged to laugh dutifully. This is merely the fault of the screenplay and its seventeen writers, in which its flaws are covered up with the obviously big-budgeted and purposefully, planted action sequences. It is quite difficult to believe that such a large pool of writing ability was unable to come up with a stronger story. The film's sound track is a mixture of 70s, 80s and 90s music, along with a few new additions. There's nothing too special here, but the music is often used at unnecessary moments in many sprinkled handfuls throughout. Obviously the biggest treat of the film was the Matrix-like action style effects. Sadly enough, I don't think they know what they're doing in there either.CHARLIE'S ANGELS the TV series was big, loud and cheesy. Merely it was all about the look of the show, and at the end of the day, what people thought of it. The film probably does credit to this factor. I enjoyed the film, and it definitely can't be taken seriously, but I hope it won't be necessary to alter my opinions if a string of sequels released for the sake of it follow.

163,Funky A,"Entertainment, where are you???",2,19 January 2001,"I haven't seen all the movies released during 2000, but Charlie's Angels is undoubtedly one of the worst. This is everything required in low-quality entertainment for people who have such low standards they should stop choosing the movies they go see and just go see something, which should be enough for them. Seriously, if this entertains you, you have a problem. This movie is bad from A to Z, skipping the letter M which stands for Bill Murray, an entertaining actor in a bad role. The acting is so unconvincing, you will probably ask yourself if what you are seeing is more than a bunch of girls reading cue cards!!! I'm serious. Barrymore is as bad as usual and Liu is awful. Even Cameron Diaz, which showed that if you give her a good script, a good director and a good partner(A Life Less Ordinary) she will be a good actress, proves that if you give her no script, a bad director which seems to have graduated from the ""MTV school of directing"" and a bad cast to interact with, she can be absolutely awful. Talking about directing, this movie must be one of the most poorly shot movies of all time. This is the first movie directed by Joseph McGinty Nichol, and I hope it is the last since his directing is so poor you will have troubles understanding how this guy can have the rights to direct. I mean, there should be a law against letting this guy direct. Everything is shot way too close(breasts and butts being zoomed in so often that it seems to be the point of the movie). Cheap camera effects are used to give people who don't know what a director with style is the impression that this movie was shot by a guy with style. You want to see style, see a Danny Boyle movie. You want to see wannabe-style, see Charlie's Angels. The action sequences are boring and shot using everything that made The Matrix original. Note to you, Mcg(as he is credited here): something is original the first time around but when you see it in twenty movies in less than a year, it's called following a trend. I'm just hoping this trend will end soon, because I'm getting tired of it. Really tired. Actually, every scene in this movie has been done once or twice before. And I will not waste a second to talk about the story, since there is none to talk about. Oh, and please, stop with the Friends stars cameo(in this case, Matt Leblanc). And one last thing, Tom Green is not funny, he's just stupid. As is this movie.23%",Charlie's Angels
164,Ripe Peach,"I'm not proud of myself, but...",10,5 February 2001,"Incredibly mindless, aimed at the lowest common denominator, superficial, truly awful dialogue, I could go on and on.  Charlie's Angels is a dreadful film.  And I loved it.Despite most of the cast (especially Bill Murray) looking distinctly uncomfortable, and despite having almost no material (lines or clothing) to work with, the three leads give it absolutely everything they've got.  The sheer energy and charisma of their performances raise what could be a cynical soft core sexploitation into a fruity, fun frollic.",Charlie's Angels
165,TimBoHannon,A dead zone in entertainment,2,25 July 2003,"Charlie's Angels is a B movie trying to pass as a blockbuster action flick. It is not a blockbuster, not is it even a B movie. Big names do not a film make, the names in this case being Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu (as the angels), Bill Murray, Sam Rockwell, Tim Curry, Luke Wilson, Matt LeBlanc, and Tom Green. Add in a contemporary rock and pop soundtrack, a load of mindless action, and a good movie will come out the oven, right? Wrong. To paraphrase James Bond, Wrong, Dead Wrong. One more star, rapper LL Cool J, has a cameo at the very beginning, he is lucky enough to exit quickly and walk away unscathed.Supposedly 18 writers were used for the script. That is embarrassing. It is not so much the dialogue that stinks which it does, but the situations in which the story takes place. At one point there is a midair rescue of guy free-falling without a parachute, which reminds me of an equally moronic sequence at the beginning of ""Moonraker."" We see the angels dance in pointless nightclub scenes (Diaz), dress as belly dancers (Barrymore and Liu), deliver telegrams dressed as school-girls while their pal Bosley (Murray) plays the tuba, and lecture software employees about new ideas in the style of Nazi Gestapo (Liu). One protracted section shows pointless scenes of the angels at play with their de facto boyfriends; no significant plot movement happens. Its sole purpose is to waste ten minutes of film.While they are not doing this, they are involved in harebrained action pieces. Bullets fly at them and they dodge them with flips that are only possible in the matrix. Of course, their entire fighting style could only exist in the matrix. After one such scene, Barrymore even dances to the soundtrack, which at its best sounds like level tunes from a Mega-Man game.There is even a tribute to ""Mission Impossible"" involving a software vault with ultra-tight security. This includes pressure sensitive floor pads that sound an alarm at any contact over a quarter second. Since the pads never deactivate, even after the outer security has been passed, we surmise that the techs can only cross it by doing cartwheels. Diaz tries that tactic out, although she touches the ground for well over a quarter second in the process without sounding the alarm. That company needs to hire an electrician.Are we, as thinking people, supposed to find these silly, boring scenes entertaining? Maybe, if you are a teenage male who calls footage of the angels flashing skin and doing utterly stupid work entertainment. If entertainment can be derived from the fighting, the viewer is required to care about the outcome, which is not an easy task. What a pity that three attractive and talented actresses would choose to reduce themselves to this.Bill Murray tries to be comical as Bosley, but he is not given any humorous material. Sam Rockwell completely falls flat as the villain, and Tim Curry's brilliance is swallowed up in the meaningless pomp and circumstance. Luke Wilson was cast as comic relief, but neither he nor or anyone else is funny. If there is a more annoying and unfunny actor than Tom Green, I don't want to see him. He makes Andre Braugher look like Sean Penn.I always try to find positives in bad films, but I can't think of any in this one. I suppose it is to be expected when the director feels he is too cool to use his birth name.Oh! there was one scene where Drew Barrymore is bound to a chair with duct tape drawn over her mouth. As she helplessly watches the villain ascertain the location of Charlie, she begins to cry. So bad was this movie that it brought out the masochist in me and I actually enjoyed her anguish.",Charlie's Angels
166,Mike Astill,A feisty spoof.,7,12 October 2001,"This feisty spoof of the popular seventies TV show is loud, brash and colourful. It's completely vacuous, but at the same time great fun. Diaz steals the show with her trademark dumb blonde routine and delivery of innocent sounding smut, but Liu and Barrymore are at least as enthusiastic in their own roles. They don't get to do any funky disco dancing though.Best not to even mention the plot, but the action comes thick and fast, and it's sufficiently punctuated with enough costume changes and casual T&A to keep us blokes happy, but with gallons of girl power added to try and ensure no one takes offence (nice try).The martial arts sequences seemed misplaced and mildly annoying at first (kung fu seems to be popping up everywhere these days, even when it has no or little right to be there), eschewing the lame judo chop' style of fighting I seem to recall from the TV show for full-on Matrix style high-tech fu. Choreographer Yuen Cheung-Yan (brother of Woo-Ping) does a fine job though  the girls kick ass and look great as they're doing it. 
Worth a view then, particularly if you're into high-kicking babes, or if you want to reflect upon how cringe-inducingly bad the TV series really was.",Charlie's Angels

168,great_sphinx_42,A Promise Kept,7,1 April 2001,"I always love to look at the scoring demographics, and here it's interesting to note that women in every age category give this flick higher points than do men. I'm sure there is a person out there sneering that it's because women are dumb and don't know what makes a good movie. That person is a creep. I think it has more to do with the fact that we so rarely get to see female action heroes, particularly ones we can like. We had Trinity at the beginning of The Matrix before the movie quickly found a man to focus on, and we have Max and Buffy on television. It's a sign, though, that even silly movies featuring women kicking butt are so popular among, well, women. We need this. We need strong females in leading roles, even in silly movies. And this is a very silly movie, make no mistake. I also think it intends to be that way. Each scene has it's own cartoon feel, and the movie itself is like a comic book come to life. There are some very nice and admirable touches, added at Drew Barrymore's insistence. We see the Angels eating heartily, we see the Angels use martial arts abilities instead of guns, we see the Angels saving gentlemen in distress. Certainly, there are aspects that could be regarded as sexist, but this is 'Charlie's Angels', for crying out loud, based on the show that spawned the term 'jiggle-television'. Worth mentioning is the wonderful Crispin Glover playing one of the odder and more unforgettable villains I've seen. Does he even have a single line of dialogue? And only 'Charlie's Angels' would feature a villain like Eric Knox. He's like the quasi-cool younger brother of those guys from 'Night at the Roxbury'. And Bill Murray is Bill Murray. There's not much else to say about that. Ultimately, the movie works because it never promised to be more than what is is- an action-comedy about three hot babes wearing cool clothes while kicking bad-guy ass. Anyone who watches it and condemns it for being anything other than that has only himself to blame.",Charlie's Angels

It works as well as it does due to the very colourful, fun and tongue firmly in cheek vibe that permeates throughout the film. This is mainly down to the zany atmosphere created by first time film-maker, but expert pop-promo director McG, In fact the real tribute has to go to him for crafting a film this good out of a very difficult production, which faced an incomplete script, and personality clashes between some of the cast. The film is clearly tongue in cheek, and references a lot of the stereotypical visual elements of action movies. From matrix bullet time to music video like super slow motion shots, the films works slapstick comedy into a serviceable plot. The three leading ladies are good value, ably supported by the rest of the cast, albeit Bill Murray's role seems to almost like a one man stand up show has been worked into the film, and seems a little out of place. Russell Carpenter's photography is vibrant and colourful, and musical choices work well for the story.Overall a lot of enjoyable fun!",Charlie's Angels

But, I'm not ashamed to say that I strong enjoyed myself during Charlie's Angels, it was mindless entertainment that all audiences can enjoy.Charlie's (an unseen John Forsythe) private investigation company is addressed by programmer Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), owner of Knox Technologies, whose revolutionary voice-recognition software has been stolen. Charlie's angels, Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) are sent to place a bug in the system of bitter rival Roger Corwin, who is under strong suspicion. But after the deed is done, the Angels and their boss Bosley (Bill Murray) face the fact of a destroyed home base as well as Charlie's life in immediate danger. But how do you protect someone you never met? Although the film is dumb and silly, it is irresistible and entertaining all at the same time. The explosions and many other death scenes are done in entertaining, clever and creative ways while the characters are all likeable (apart from the baddies). Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu obviously all had a brilliant time making Charlie's Angels, while director Joseph McGinty Nichol looks like he had a blast ordering them around nicely!Silly, enthralling fun that deserves to take up your time if your in the mood for a kick-ass movie.I rate Charlie's Angels 7 out of 10.",Charlie's Angels
173,MadReviewer,"Messy, Incoherent, and Occasionally Fun (But Not Often)",3,8 May 2001,"`Charlie's Angels', for the uninitiated, is about the mysterious, unseen Charlie (voice by John Forsythe) and his band of three glamorous private investigators:  Dylan (Drew Barrymore), Natalie (Cameron Diaz), and Alex (Lucy Liu).  The Angels, under the occasional direction of the bumbling Bosley (Bill Murray), solve mysteries and kick the crap out of villains. In this particular film (probably the first of many . . . shudder), the mystery involves computers and some high-tech voice recognition software.  The story never gets much more complicated than that, as the entire plot is simply a MacGuffin to link the comedy scenes and action scenes together into a reasonable facsimile of an actual film.The saving graces of `Charlie's Angels' are Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu.  As Natalie, Diaz exudes the right amounts of bubbly, air-headed charm and toughness to make her genuinely funny  and genuinely appealing.  Diaz is clearly the star of `Charlie's Angels', and she makes the most of what she's given.  Lucy Liu's portrayal of Alex is also dead-on great; she's hell on wheels with a sharp tongue and deadly wit. (The scene where she impersonates a leather-clad corporate trainer is possibly the best in the film).  Once you get past Diaz and Liu, though, there's not much left worth watching. Drew Barrymore is horrible as the supposedly street-tough Dylan; she's not sexy, she's not sympathetic, and she certainly doesn't come across as tough. Barrymore would be doing herself a huge favor as producer if she bowed out of the film and let somebody else take her place (my replacement vote is for Eliza Dushku of `Buffy' and `Bring It On' fame).  Crispin `McFly' Glover is a waste as one of the main villains, Bill Murray doesn't do anything but mug for the cameras, Tom Green is simply annoying . . . the list of bad performances goes on and on.  Toss that in with the witless plot and the action sequences stolen straight out of `The Matrix' and the entire Jet Li film catalog, and the result is a whole exciting lot of nothing.If you're truly compelled to watch this movie, just rent (not buy) the DVD, so you can shoot straight to the few good scenes prominently featuring Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu.  The rest of the movie's not worth watching. It's sad when it seems like a film is dragging . . . and it's only 98 minutes long.  Grade: D",Charlie's Angels

Yes, it bored, then irritated, then angered me and twenty minutes into this puerile mess I was contemplating never watching another movie in my life and taking up a hobby like making corn dollies. From the frantic start it is clear that very little attention was given to writing a decent script and it goes downhill once the scriptwriter decided to inject some ""humour"" into it. ""I like it STRAIGHT"" the airplane passenger tells the camp air steward. (ooh ow stop it I nearly bust a gut laughing) Later, poor Cameron Diaz gets to wiggle her ass in her panties and even answer the door to the postman in her scanties - where she hilariously tells him that he can put it in her slot whenever he wants.  Hey!! Its called a letterbox!  The standard of comic writing is 1000 times below that of the very worst Carry On film.  Its as if a particularly stupid idiot college boy thought he'd add a few risque giggles to spice up an already well below par script. And as for the direction! Did anybody actually bother to direct this?  Never has a screen been filled with such a mess.  Even the potentially exciting fight scenes are so clumsily choreographed as to take away any possible excitement. (""Crouching Tiger"" this certainly ain't). The whole thing plods along humourlessly and tediously and perhaps you can waste a few minutes wondering how many good films could have been made with the budget.

It doesn't help that this movie is loaded with more unintentional humor than the real thing.

There was a 70-year-old guy next to me at this movie who kept asking his wife what the heck was going on? I can sympathize and I'm half his age. So this is the way action-comedies are headed. This is what we've aspired to. ""Charlie's Angels: THE MOVIE"" was just one long music video with electronica pounding on the soundtrack throughout. I don't know where to begin. The story is lame. As usual, it's just a formula as an excuse to have cute scenes with the three leads wearing different revealing costumes. Crispin Glover has no lines, just fight scenes that are entire special-effects jobs. (It's time to stop showing us the camera trick of people freezing in mid-air and then having the image rotate while still frozen. We saw this five years ago in a Gap ad and it was perfected in the 'Matrix' so stop it already. While we're at it, no more pulling an impossibly realistic mask off to reveal another character underneath. In this movie a 250-pound black man is revealed to be Drew Barrymore. Come on!) The only reason to see this video-movie is to see the actresses in various stages of undress. This is a very good reason. Watching Cameron Diaz shake her panty-clad ass at you is almost a cinematic moment in and of itself.Bill Murray is completely wasted as Bosley. That's too bad because this movie badly needed some of his type of humor. I also heard there was conflict between him and the gals while making this, and that's why he isn't doing anything here except walking around acting stupid (Bonk! Duh, I hit my head. Doh-de-doh!). In fact all the men in this movie are nobodies. Every male character is merely a walk-on for some fringe actor who saw the title and said, ""Oh yeah! I gotta be in that 'Charlie's Angels' movie! Call my agent!""This movie is exhausting. But I don't want to give the impression that it's a total waste of time. There are many scenes mocking the old TV series, which is always good for an easy laugh. The look of the movie is the best thing about it. My biggest beef is when it was over it felt like I had ridden a roller coaster for two and a half hours straight. But it was only 90 minutes. And what kind of a name for a director is McG?

Many of the scenes leave reason way behind (e.g. what happened to the airline passengers in the pre-titles sequence? (Presumably victims of the need to get a breath-taking, high thrills opening section)), but that is what you have to expect in a film targeted four-square at the eye and the gut and forgetting about the brain virtually entirely. Taken in that vein, I think this earns its popcorn.",Charlie's Angels
181,Rinho18,I was very disappointed,3,21 January 2001,"I ( male ,16 ) just came back from the cinema. I saw ""Charlie´s Angels"" with Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu. I have seen the trailer, so I thought it could be quite good, interesting and sexy. But it was bad, uninteresting and not that sexy. The actors are bad, except Drew Barrymore ( she was good ). Cameron Diaz tried to smile as much as she can and thought anyone could like that. My friend ( aged 19 ) liked this movie a lot, but I do not understand why he did. The opening sequence was very stupid and to fast edited, so you could not see what actually is going on ( and that goes on for the rest of the movie). This movie is very illogical. If Drew barrymore is tied up a chair, she would not be able to fight against FIVE men. Maybe James Bond does, but not Dylan ( Drew B. ). All in all, I hated this movie and I am still wondering why I did not fall asleep during the movie. I rated this movie 2/10, it is very disappointing.",Charlie's Angels
182,GLanoue,Brainless fun,6,2 January 2011,"This remake of the 70s cult hit that helped launch Big Hair (RIP Farrah) is so cartoonish that by comparison the original seems as complex as a Bergman movie. Still, it's all in good fun. High spirits, nice cinematic fight scenes, dopey Bill Murray (always welcome), bend over shots (nothing too racy, though) of three really fit and appealing women. What more can one ask? There are enough allusions to the original (the speaker phone, for example) to get the audience involved in the referencing game and make us all think we're so clever; it's an effective strategy to get us on board. Since the movie is a reinterpretation, it has to add something extra to the vapid quality of the original. Besides the stylised violence, here, director McG goes for colour. Almost nobody gets seriously hurt, and the girls don't use guns. But the bright and sometimes grating colours drag the audience into the pacing, since they are so forcefully vivid and jarring that they unconsciously keep the audience on the edge of its collective seat. It's a happening, man, like Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. Whatver, someone knew what they were doing and managed to overcome the inherent silliness of the whole concept. Enjoy the movie, go along for the ride: it's fast paced, and the three stars are sufficiently airheaded (to give them credit, they manage to communicate being modern without playing up sex) that they gain our sympathy.",Charlie's Angels

You combine three great-looking women, an awesome soundtrack, fun lines and mindless action. You get a great movie with a high entertainment value.When I walked into the theatre I had very low hopes of this being a good movie, 'cause when I see a director on the credits with the name McG my expectations sink to an all-time low (this partially due to The Cell by Tarsem). But he managed to pull it off.The women play exquisitely, everyone of them. Crispin Glover is great as the ultra uptight henchman of the bad guy ""Creepy Thin Man"", and Bill Murray was for the first time in years again his old self.The dialogue was very well-written for this sort of movie, lighthearted and funny. Out of all the Holiday fluff that was released this year this one stood above all else with head and shoulders. This will make a great DVD.If they can make this into a successful series, they have my blessing.8/10",Charlie's Angels

188,MissCzarChasm,Pure Entertainment at its Best!,10,4 November 2000,"I agree with one of the comments that was posted about this movie that some critics would tear this film apart. Now i've read some critical reviews of the movie and some critics liked it but for the most part i knew that they wouldn't get the concept. This movie is made solely for Entertainment value. so ignore the plot and just have fun watching 3 beautiful and talented ladies kicking butt and having fun doing it.i would waste time writing about the lack of plot but i will write about the things i liked and didn't like.The good: The 3 angels are great in the movie. Drew Barrymore who also co-produced the movie is great in the movie. she was easily my favorite angel in the movie. she's beautiful and very talented. Lucy Liu was my sceond favorite angel. She's so sexy and very talented and i would love to see her in more movies. Cameron diaz comes up 3rd but she is the funniest angel and she's a great comic actress. i loved her in this movie.Bill Murrary is a positive in the movie but he's really underused. However, the scenes he does appear in are hilarious. he has great comic timing and was a great addition to the cast.The villians kicked ass. Starting with that hott chick kelly lynch who played vivian wood. she was great and had a chance to kick a lot of butt in this movie. Crispin Glover as the ""thin man"" was very creepy and weird but he was great and his fight scenes are  out of this world. The main villian however nox, isn't that great. he's effective but compared to the rest he's a weak link.The soundtrack is way awesome. some good tunes in this movie. that was a plus for me.The action sequences rocked the house. they were very matrix like but they were way cool. in my opinion cameron diaz and lucy liu handled their fight scenes the best. but drew's big fight scene when she's sitting in the chair is awesome and way funny.The Bad:this is a dumb reason but it's too short and it made me wanting more and i guess that could be a good thing but i left the theatre wanting more of these angels.Anyway all you boring critics out  there get a clue and enjoy this movie and any other movie that is made dfor entertainment value. i hope critics get the clue very soon",Charlie's Angels
189,MissCzarChasm,Pure Entertainment at its Best!,10,5 November 2000,"Charlies Angels was awesome. I have never been so entertained by a film in a long while. Now critics had it all wrong when they viewed this movie. Roger Ebert called it ""mindless and dumb"". If he would've viewed this film from a an entertainment stand point he would've realized that this movie is pretty good. Instead he, and along with many other critics picked apart the plot. This isn't trying to be American Beauty people, it was made so we could have fun while watching it and i for one was very entertained.The acting is the best part mainly because the actors don't take the material too seriously and they know what kind of movie they're making. Drew Barrymore who was a driving force in getting this movie made, was my favorite angel. She's fierce, sexy and talented and she is becoming one of my fave actresses. Cameron Diaz is second. Boy she was hilarious. Wait untill you see the soul train scene. i was laughing so hard. Lucy liu ges to kick the most butt and this film shows that she can hold her on in a major motion picture. Bill Murrary is underused as Bosley but the scenes he does appear in are really funny and he was a joy to watch. Crispin Glover and kelly Lynch are so cool as the villians. crispin glover plays it very weird but his fight scenes are way awesome. kelly lynch is cool too. She's bad and kicks a lot of but.The fight scenes are another highlight of th film. they are well choreagraphed and they are really cool to watch. I especially liked Drew's fight scene towards the end. it was great.If you want to be fully entertained this is the movie for you just sit back and don't take it too seriously. 8/10",Charlie's Angels
190,thomasgulch,Second worst movie I have ever seen,1,5 February 2002,Maybe the idiots that made Travoltas' Battlefield Earth should seriously get the idiots that made Charlies' Angels and have them do the much rumoured Battlefield Earth: The Sequel.What a waste of film.,Charlie's Angels
191,Rainbowbeany,Entertaining!!,8,28 June 2019,After seeing this movie on opening night back in 2000. I fell in love with all three of these leading ladies. They brought a sense of charm to their roles. It's hard to pick a favorite out of the three. Cameron has a girl next door quality to her. Lucy is a force to be reckoned with but also cute and funny. Breaking away from the normal ice queen that we are used to. (I.e. her character on Ally McBeal). Drew brings a tomboy characterization to her role. She is the more rough and tumble one that I relate to the most. The movie starts out with them as the Angels already. They are a kick butt team of goofy secret agents. I say goofy but they take their job very seriously. For the most part. There is a lot of cliches here and some unrealistic disguises but it's all in good fun. In real life spies are to blend in when these girls are designed to stand out. The action is from the post Matrix phase. Lots of slow motion high flying wire stunts. Which I enjoy still to this day. Again unrealistic but fun. I call this type of movie a bubble gum pop action movie with a killer soundtrack. It's more fun if you turn your brain off at the door.,Charlie's Angels
192,rastaban3,Another remake but cheesy,6,31 March 2001,"I liked watching the series ""Charlie's Angels"" when I was a kid.  I thought this movie would be just as good.  I was a little disappointed with it. The special affects were good.  A few of them could have used a little more work as they reminded me of some of the special affects that were common in the 70's and early 80's.  However, the affects in the fight scenes were first rate.  They compared well to some of the scenes in ""The Matrix"".  The plot line was original and helped the movie.  However, this movie was set in the here and now.  So some of the scenes were unbelievable for this movie.  If this movie had be set in the future, they might have been more believable. This was the a major minus to the film.I am glad I waited to rent this one.  I would have been more disappointed in the movie if I had spent seven bucks to see it in the theater.  Overall, this movie is a good remake of an older series but has some unbelievable scenes that take away from the movie.  (6 out of 10).",Charlie's Angels
193,MyDarkStar,Terrible !,3,28 November 2001,"The only reason I even give this movie a 1 is because of the opening scene, which is by far the most original and exciting scene in the movie. The fight scenes are over-choreographed. The plot is rediculous. The acting basically consists of the three main actresses playing their ""look"" into the camera. Even Bill Murray is dissapointing. Did somebody actually go to this, and leave the theatre thinking ""Yha, that was worth my time and money."" ?Just like the one-line summary says, TERRIBLE !",Charlie's Angels
194,larrysmile1,"Not your father's ""Charlie's Angels""",6,4 January 2002,"Dear Drew: I know from the credits you are one of the ""producers"" of this film.  If you were paid a lot of money for this ""fluff"" movie, OK. Now, please, never make another movie where you ""share"" the female lead role equally in an ensemble team-concept like Charlie's Angels.  Also, don't accept roles where you have no meaningful speaking lines.  Uttering two-line cue card dialog between scene takes is not ""serious acting.""  You are capable of carrying a complete movie feature as the solo actress and your lines should be spoken in meaningful paragraphs rather than ""Valley-Teen DUH words.""  Now, I know it was fun for the three ""karate-expert"" Angels to make this film.  OK.  You have gotten it out of your system.  Let's get back to some serious acting.  You are lovely in costume period roles!  Enjoy being the fairy princess that you are!Having John Forsythe's voice as in the original Charlie's Angels TV series is a necessity.  I am old enough to know what he really looks like.  Many women, today, would swoon over him if he were as young now as he was back in the  middle of the last century.  Having Bill Murray in the Bosley role was acceptable.  Of course, it's a better movie when Bill Murray is the star and has the entire movie to display his unique brand of comedy.  Tim Curry played the role of a not-so really bad guy with a sense of comedy well.  No adverse criticism here.  He is always a good character actor.  He lends class to any movie he appears in.For the rest of the male actors, sorry, you were completely forgetable once the film was over.  It's amazing that all these beautiful lady-stars are so young and have such amazing karate/martial arts skills.  Even all the bad guys are karate trained!  If an average person were kicked in the chest or head even once, they would be rendered unconscious or incapable of getting up to fight another round!  Unbelievable!In the original Charlie's Angels the gals were not so high-tech.  They used their powers of deductive reasoning, femininity, and race-car driving ability to win the day.  Here, it seems that the new era of Angels have to have all-kinds of engineering degrees to complete the mission.   And - they speak Asian languages, to boot!  Unbelievable. Cameron Diaz seemed too silly in her role to be taken seriously.  Although it was nice seeing her ""shake her booty"" during the Soul Train scene.  Lucy Liu seemed lost trying to be the serious-minded Angel. 
And, for all their powers and sophistication, the Angels had a ""love interest"" that was beneath their intelligence level.  The original Charlie's Angels would not jeopardize their mission by falling ""gaga"" for some unlikely ""hunk.""  Not a good choice, movie writers, for having the girls in bed with guys during the course of completing the ""mission"" for Charlie. 
Although the director was shown on Cinemax, prior to a recent TV showing, making self-praise for his first full length directing feature, he should take the money and run and not bore the viewing audience with self-aggrandizement.  For, it was not earned with this film.The double meaning, gratuitous, phallic symbol sex joke exchange between characters Roger Corwin and Alex Munday at the massage table was in poor taste.  Cheap trick suitable for late-night cable standup comics but not for a PG-13 general release movie!Sure, watch it just to see the pretty girls as this is what we are supposed to do with Charlie's Angels.  And, don't believe anything about the movie from that point on!",Charlie's Angels
195,ShinKyo81,"A brilliant film between Mission Impossible, Matrix and Austin Powers",7,2 December 2000,"I had always heard of the famous TV series called ""Charlie's Angels"", but I never saw the show. Then, I saw on the papers that it was a film based on the series in production. And I found it interesting, more interesting when I read that Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore, three beautiful and excellent actress would play the role of the supersecret agents.The film is a mixture, from my point of view, of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (because the superagent-thrilling action), THE MATRIX (because of all the fight scenes, the camera rotations, the japanese manga style in the fighting) and AUSTIN POWERS (because of the '60s atmosphere, the pop music and the retro-ambience).I must say that I didn't expect so much enjoyment from this film. It's incredibly fast, dynamic and smart. Drew, Cameron and Lucy play our roles with extraordinary naturalness, showing the best of them (in all the meanings :) ). But I must say that this films is not as chauvinist as it seems. It's just 50/50 in that point, because in some parts of the film, man is ridiculed by the power of women :)So, if you like action, humour (just don't miss Bill Murray's performance: incredible!), fighting scenes, and of course, the ""presence"" of Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu (and for the female audience, Matt LeBlanc appears also on the film!), just go straight into the theatre to spend one hour and a half of entertainment.

196,LDB_Movies,Not as bad as I thought it would be...,7,9 December 2001,"Didn't see this film when it came out because it didn't appeal to me at first - but just watched it on cable. Now I am VERY critical of most movies and it takes a lot to please me. That being said, this wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.Actually it was kind of cute. The best parts were in the first half, when the girls were dressing up in all kinds of different costumes and going ""undercover"" to scout out the crime and criminals. Then unfortunately the movie turned into Jane Bond and went way over the top. The first half is very true to the TV series and the second half isn't. Other complaints are the presence of Tom Green (not just in the movie but basically on planet Earth) and the stupid Matrix-Crouching Tiger fight scenes. But those fight scenes were required in every movie in the year 2000, I think - and now that the 3 Musketeers remake with those fight scenes bombed - we have a reprieve for a while.

Almost everyone in the film is great, with the only false note being Drew Barrymore. She does the best she can, but pales in comparison to the other 2 angels, especially Cameron Diaz, who comes across like a reincarnated Lucille Ball: a drop-dead gorgeous woman with a fantastic sense of comic timing.

Then there's the script, and I use the word loosely. A mishmosh of boyhood fantasies of what the original show was mixed with the worst of pop culture references and bad imitations of the Matrix. (Why is it that Hollywood never understood that The Matrix is much more than some martial arts moves and slow motion bullets?)I only hope that the next one is either a quantum leap from this horrible drek - or that everyone boycotts this franchise the way they did The Real Cancun.One more thing - bad music from the 80's is not kitsch - it's just bad music!",Charlie's Angels

This leads to a film that makes no sense and moves along at a slug's pace.The whole cast is just wasted with the three stars making total fools of themselves with the only thing keeping it entirely afloat is the unique chemistry between Tim Curry and Bill Murray and a rather interesting bad guy played by Crispen Glover.The action is lame and rather cartoonish which leads to an identity crisis: who was this film intended for? Kids will be bored and even adults will tire of the endless and tasteless t&a jokes.Bottom-line? This is a crash and burn mess.

What really makes the film work is the charisma ( & physical charms )of the 3 leading ladies, combined with well-choreographed action sequences and the tongue-in-cheek script.

That doesn't make it LESS stupid, but it is refreshing to see a film not take itself seriously.

206,Psycho Mantis,Forget the plot - this is fun!,7,7 July 2001,"After I had seen the awful re-make of the old TV-show ""The Avengers"", I had my doubts about ""Charlie´s Angels"". Do we really need to see another forgotten classic remade for the new generation? Apparently, we did.Three beautiful special agents, Natalie, Dylan and Alex, works for a mysterious man named Charlie, and together they go by the name of Charlie´s Angels. They save the world from all kinds of troubles, and this time they are going to save the important man Eric Knox, but things are not quite what the angels expected.If you can forget about the silly plot, and just look at the cool action sequences and the amusing dialogue, you are in for a treat. The movie looks really good, with great special effects and the girls look drop dead gorgeous in all their different and stylish outfits. And the fact that they almost always behave like a bunch of naive schoolgirls, and the next second they do some serious ass kicking, only makes the movie funnier. The soundtrack is a killer, with everything from Destiny´s Child to Prodigy in it. Diaz, Barrymore and Liu are all very sexy as the angels, and even if they are clearly no comedians, they provide some laughs. Bill Murray is as adorable as always, this time as Bosley, who helps the angels when it is needed. The villains are also charismatic, especially Crispin Glover´s ""The Thin Man"", which is very important for a popcorn movie like this.
But you can´t deny that the script is pretty stupid and gradually I found myself somewhat tired of the angels´ clever remarks. Add three unfunny cameos by LL Cool J, Matt LeBlanc and Tom Green, and you realize that ""Charlie´s Angels"" is not perfect. But it does have some funny and trivial jokes, for example: Matt LeBlanc´s character is a lousy actor, just like he is as Joey in the sitcom ""Friends"".

The pitch meeting musthave gone something like, ""It's the Spice Girls meet the Matrix!""This film is definitely rooted in 2000, and was made with acompletely contemporary sensibility.

But a highly entertaining and well-done movie besides.The three leads -- Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu -- are great as the Angels.  They each have a distinct personality, fashion sense, and fighting style.  Besides that, they look fabulous in every scene.  The martial arts action is some of the best I've ever seen, reminiscent of both ""Iron Monkey"" and ""Heroic Trio.""  The fact that the leads themselves did the wire work and kicks makes it even more wonderful to watch.McG has done a fabulous job making the movie a visual treat.  Every scene is vibrant with its own color palette, jumping out at you from the screen.  Add to this great supporting performances by Bill Murray, Tim Curry, Sam Rockwell, Kelly Lynch, and the striking Crispin Glover, and you've got a great movie.Just a word of warning: leave your logic circuits at the door.  The plot is beyond fluff and without any depth, but that's the point.  It's Charlie's Angels.  If you want deep plot and complexity, this is NOT the movie for you.  If, however, you want fabulous action, great humor, and one of the most kinetic movies of 2000, watch ""Charlie's Angels.""",Charlie's Angels
209,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 4 out of 5,5,27 December 2002,"Charlie's Angels is a sweet, insubstantial and highly entertaining dose of girl power.  Although it will probably never be included in a list of 'alltime great films' it is nevertheless an enjoyable escape into a world where beautiful women kick-box their way out of danger, and manage to foil the bad guy's plans; all without smudging their makeup.Alex, Dylan and Natalie are an incredibly sexy crime-fighting trio, backed by an anonymous millionaire named Charlie.  These Angels are the absolute epitome of cool.  They can change from evening dress to street clothes in a matter of seconds, out-fight any number of evil henchmen, and disable a helicopter whilst hanging from the landing skids.  And they manage to have a whole lot of laughs in the process; however if you're not a big fan of girlie giggles, this may start to grate after a while.The movie begins with a high-speed action sequence involving an attempted airplane hijacking which the Angels seemingly effortlessly manage to foil - this montage is perhaps emblematic of the rest of the film.  The 'teamwork' motif is heavily emphasised, with the camera frequently (and occasionally annoyingly) cutting between the Angels whenever they're not in the same place at the same time.  Visually stunning Matrix-style action sequences are peppered throughout the fast-paced script and these are well worth watching, even if only to marvel at how efficiently the fabulous trio of Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz dispatch with the baddies whilst wearing designer clothing and high heels.Charlie's Angels is not a movie that is likely to alter lives or provoke deep thought, but instead it can be enjoyed purely as fun escapism.  And after all, isn't that what movies are supposed to be all about?",Charlie's Angels
210,Aphex97,"All style, no substance...",6,4 June 2001,"This movie has much going for it. Awesome action sequences with high-flying explosions, high-speed chases, fascinating and beautifully choreographed martial art sequences, and excellent special effects all directed with flash and style.And what about those leading ladies?!?! All three (Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore) are so damn cute and appealing in their own unique way that you can't help but like them. Lets not forget the equally wonderful performance by Bill Murray, one of America's greatest comedians. This movie's high production values are present throughout. It has wonderful costume and set design, better-than-average action sequences, directing, and special effects, and topped off with a winning and lovable cast....yes sir this movie has everything...well almost everything...WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE PLOT?! This movie is held together by the thinest of storyline. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous! The viewer is expected to takes huge leaps of faith and shut down all logical thinking as the mindless plot plods along to the next action sequence. All the film's so-called ""twists"" can be seen miles away. The villain dialogue is so horribly cheesy, I can barely listen to it!FINAL RATING:  6/10 -  Maybe the studio should have spent at least some of the $92 million dollar budget on a decent script, and this movie could have been very excellent! As it is, it remains nice brainless fun that is best enjoyed with friends over a beer or two (or three)! Action-lovers will cherish it and casual movie fans of all genres will probably find something to like about it. Noob Aalox",Charlie's Angels

There is no real plot to talk of, and what little there is is mostly poorly thought out.

214,fewald139,Quality dumb fun entertainment,8,7 October 2019,"I was twelve when I first saw this in theaters. I absolutely loved it, bought the VHS (and later the DVD), and watched it repeatedly with my friends. It was quotable and inspirational to me at the time, for it sparked my interest in martial arts. After having not seen the movie in at least ten to fifteen years, it popped up on Netflix. I decided to watch it again to see if it's one of those movies that loses its appeal as one ages. I found I still love it.Charlie's Angels won't win any awards, but if you love dumb fun movies that dip their toes into ridiculous territory, you can't find much better than this. The awesome soundtrack remains awesome, featuring such nostalgic bands as the Prodigy, Blink 182, and Heart. It does manage to slip up here with a song by Destiny's Child, but its time is mercifully cut short and shoved toward the end. The story is threadbare; as a child, I didn't pay much attention to it. As an adult, I did, and it does the job. There's a point A and a point B, and the journey between them is the focus here, showcasing the angels Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore), and Alex (Lucy Liu) completing various intelligence tasks utilizing flashy costumes and eye-rollingly ridiculous or goofy techniques. There's wonderful use of various locales in the movie as it goes from set to set (a fort near the ocean, a racetrack, the beach, a movie set, an airplane). Some scenes utilizing green screen didn't age too well, but they aren't embarrassing. I learned my love of the beautifully awkward Crispin Glover here; as the silent and aptly named Creepy Thin Man, he is nothing but intriguing and unique as a minor villain (who comes back for the sequel). Sam Rockwell is also interesting in his own right, and Bill Murray puts in a chuckle-worthy performance as Bosley.As for the angels, growing up I idolized Dylan for her rebellious and punkish ways, and she has arguably the best scene in the movie (involving taking out a room full of guys while tied to a chair with her arms behind her back). Barrymore clearly had a ton of fun in the role. Diaz has a blast playing the goofy Natalie, who not only shines during many of the fight scenes but also manages to bring life to the movie with her ceaseless energy. The only angel of the bunch who wasn't distinguished enough is Liu as Alex. Alex completes a few tech tasks throughout the film and has one memorable scene to the song Barracuda (which also features a brief before-she-was-famous cameo by Melissa McCarthy), but the other two angels are just SO unique and fun that she pales in comparison.Another review related Charlie's Angels to a long music video, and that comparison is fair. The movie is so focused on being cool, flashy, and syncing up slow-mo action scenes to fantastic music that it doesn't hit the points of everything that makes a movie a true ""film"" because it doesn't try to reach them. The director is the under-named McG, who is responsible for directing/producing some of the most memorable music videos of the '90s (The Offspring's ""Pretty Fly for a White Guy"" and Smash Mouth's ""All Star"" to name a few, the latter of which was his last credit before this). Like those music videos, Charlie's Angels is full of color and hints of goofiness. This movie has tons of flaws that film critics could pick apart, but as a piece of solid entertainment, it never bores. Full of personality, great music, and memorable set pieces and costumes, this movie may not always be cohesive, but it's a heckuva lot of fun.For entertainment value alone I'd give this a 10; as a joyless critic I'd give it a 6. My final score ends up just in the middle at an 8. This won't be my last time re-watching this movie; there's just too much to love.",Charlie's Angels

225,CHendri887,"Bad, really bad",3,10 April 2001,"I can't believe this movie was even made.  I mean, I can, because I view Hollywood like a sewer churning out waste, but still....
No plot, no acting, no dialogue, but lots of silly self-destructive action scenes for teenagers to watch and imitate.  ""Yeah, dude, let's crazy like they did in that car scene in Charlie's Angeles.  Huh, huh.""
I guess the rationale (not that there has to be any) for making a movie like ""Charlie's Angels"" would be, ""It's entertaining.""  Hmm.  But entertainment at what cost?  Isn't there supposed to be something funny, amusing, enjoyable, worthy of emotion in an ""entertaining"" movie?  I certainly didn't see that here.What bugged me?  First off, the portrayal of men and women.  What message is this movie sending about men's and women's sex/gender roles?  (I guess those who say this movie is ""entertaining"" would say, ""No message, it's just entertainment,"" but even entertaining movies send messages).  Are Lucy Liu, Cameron Diaz, and Drew Barrymore supposed to be portraying ""strong women"" in the movie?  I certainly don't see that.  I see ""Charlie's Angels"" portraying women as teasing sex objects--little girl voices (What's going on with Lucy Liu's voice?  Is this the way she really speaks?)and punishing men by displaying their unobtainable bodies.  And men are portrayed as idiotic bumbling dupes or evil jerks.  It's just the same old stereotypes of our old cultural friend the patriarch/matriarchy reinforced and glorified again on the big screen.  But perhaps it's supposed to be a joke--this portrayal of men and women?  But even it's supposed to be a joke, I just don't find it funny.Related to this issue of the portrayal of women, I really felt that in some scenes in the movie Liu, Barrymore, and Diaz were struggling to act and read such idiotic lines.  I am sure that all three of these women are smart and had their own reasons for wanting to make this movie, but still.... Perhaps they thought it was humorous.  But it seems like the script is beneath them. The action scenes, no question, I am sure they were fun to make, but the dialogue.  God, it must have been painful for them to make those dopey giggling noises every time they talked to ""Charlie.""And about the action scenes.  OK, I guess a lot of people think this type of thing is entertainment.  For me, the action in this movie (and other movies like it), is simply disturbing.  Why?  Because it portrays extreme violence as something fun and without consequences.  Examples:  Car chases through the city in which dozens of innocent people would be killed and everyone's laughing at the end of the scene.  Fight scenes where people would be severely damaged physically and everyone gets up and walks away as if nothing happened.  Maybe I'm uptight about this kind of thing, but it just bugs me that our culture feels this is ""entertainment.""",Charlie's Angels
226,Soujiro,This Movie Makes me Sad,4,13 November 2000,"Hollywood keeps trying to import the Hong Kong feel into their movies. While I guess some would take it as a nice tribute to HK cinema, it makes me sick to my stomach that they just can't seem to do it right.There's no other way to put it, this is just a bad movie. I guess it's supposed to be entertaining for the prepubescent crowd and campy for the older folks...oh yeah and empowering for the women.Let's see...horrible script, terrible acting, painfully clichéd plot, all of these are pretty standard for an action movie. However, the problem is that the action in this movie is pathetic. If you enjoyed the action in The Matrix, maybe you'll appreciate the fine athletic ability shown here.Here's the basic problem, no amount of fancy effects and digital editing can disguise the fact that these women do not know martial arts. Heck...Drew Barrymore can't even fake Michael Jackson's moonwalk something that I thought every four year old child could accomplish. In the old days, at least the stunt doubles knew what they were doing. The solution today seems to be 2 second takes, sudden freeze frames and slow motion, and tight camera angles. It looks awkward and artificial, it prevents you from knowing exactly what's happening, in disrupts the flow of the scene, and it distances you from the movie.Hollywood should understand that martial arts is not solely guys screaming and making random cool poses every once in a while. It's almost insulting to watch the action scenes in this movie. It's similar to making random strange sounds in an attempt to imitate the Chinese language. Cameron Diaz and seems to be the only person to give any effort at all in both acting and action, but then again she's given the most to work with.It's a sad reflection on popular American culture that The Legend of Drunken Master, a movie just as ""campy"" as Charlie's angels, one of the greatest action movie ever filmed, goes by unwatched and unnoticed while this piece of music video trash is put on a pedestal. I will say this, Drew Barrymore seems to have Americans figured out, or perhaps she just shares their general stupidity and lack of taste.

Let's face it Charlies Angels was the Baywatch of the day.  And it would therefore be a mistake to expect the film version to have undergone the same transformation as the Mission Impossible series made to the big screen.It's certainly courageous for the film-makers to create something which is unashamed, unadulterated funny fun.  There is a tendency to design huge memorable action set-pieces and to write a plot around them as convincingly as possible - like Mission Impossible 2. Charlie's Angels manages it quite well although the racing cars sequence is slightly blatant irrelevant nonsense.  That was the second time the bad guy ran away for no reason just to have a chase scene.  People note that there were 14 writers who had their hand on the screenplay at some point.  Due to scheduling conflicts they had to start the film before the script was finished.  The last act was meant to be a last minute job but that works fine it's the middle section which doesn't quite hold water.  Although it has its faults I wasn't bored and I wasn't annoyed too much. The tongue is clearly firmly in cheek and quite frankly the storyline with the typical British bad guy made me forgive everything.",Charlie's Angels

Both Lucy Lui and Cameron Diaz are slim, graceful and elegant which as a red-blooded male a appreciate. In slo-mo they glide easily through the scene.

All men were portrayed as spineless imbeciles who had no thoughts other than sex. All women were portrayed as manipulators who had no way other than showing their cleavage to get what they want. Yes, I know this was meant to be farce, but it was still an even more unrealistic portrayal of the world than in a James Bond movie (or even Austin Powers). The plot seems nothing more than a thinly veiled excuse to glance on every sexual fantasy known to man. We sees the angels dressed as domintrices, geishas, German milkmaids, even as men. We see them drive race cars, doing stunts which were so obviously CGI enhanced they were ludicrous, and scaling walls in cat suits. What we don't see is any indication that they know why they're there.We can't blame them, though, the script seems to have been written, on-the-fly as it were, as if the writers said ""Hey, we've got these geisha costumes, let's have a seen where the girls pretend to be geishas!"" What vestiges of plot exist are stolen, lock stock and barrel from Mission Impossible, and James Bond movies.Let me just say this one more time, I KNOW! You don't go to this movie to see an original plot, you go there to ogle Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore. Well, great, couldn't they have been given a decent script to work with? It seems both sloppy and cynical to give three of the best actresses in Hollywood such garbage to work with, under the assumption that most people will just be there to stare at their breasts.
And while the actresses might have been great, the director was horrible. He had no discipline whatsoever. At the end they show out-takes, and a lot of the scenes looked completely different from the finished version. Its like he just let the actors get up there and do whatever they felt like doing. I've looked him up in the database and he's never done any other film, and I hope he won't.My final criticism should speak more eloquently than any other about this movie: Tom Green has a speaking part in it.

Three lively and exceptionally attractive young actresses duck and dive and dance and fight in a film that is visually witty and its stars displaying admirable verve.  The sheer silly grinning delight of Cameron Diaz is noteworthy.  ""Charlie's Angels"" makes no demands and delivers what it promises.  In short, it is significant only in pleasing.

This had horrible acting and a high cheese factor--two of the necessary ingredients--but nothing funny enough to make it achieve the status of such wunderbar bad movies as ""Better Off Dead"" or ""Rock n' Roll High School.""  I wasn't expecting award-winning performances, but I also didn't think it would be such a piece of crap. Even the normally fabulous Bill Murray couldn't turn this waste of space around.

The opening sequence blistered on to the screen with a convoluted Bond-like opening (I swear I heard tributes to Bond and Mission Impossible in the musical score). The action was intense all the way up to the first dialogue. I began to hope that the dialogue wouldn't spoil the movie. For the most part the dialogue added to this tasty bit of cheese.
There were several scenes that were laugh getters, and the Cameron Diaz scene on Soul Train worked for me. There were a few low spots, but not enough to ruin it for me. First off, when you see this movie throw reality out the window. It is a comic book with comic book characters.As a piece of great cinema, this won't compare. But as a fun-filled, care-free piece of cheese that will get you out of yourself for a little while, this is definitely worthwhile.However, if you do not or can not enjoy cheese, this movie is not for you (RE).",Charlie's Angels

But boy was I wrong!  This film has it all. The good storyline was married with excellent fight sequences, and Bill Murray gave his usual star turn as Bosley, the father figure to the angels. All three ladies were believable, funny, and just oozed sex appeal, I could not choose between them.  The ""Matrix"" style fight sequences did not look laughable as some might imagine, they worked very well, and at one point the film rewound for a few seconds and replyed the action which was a great touch.All the supporting cast were great, but credit to Ms Diaz, Barrymore and Liu, they were all fantastic and incredibly sexy.

That just proves how some people don't get it. ""Charlie's"" doesn't claim to be Oscar material, just a mindless waste of a couple hours. The script was horrible, the acting cheesy, and the action sequences were all ripped out of the ""Matrix"" playbook. But it was worth every penny to see it. This movie succeeded where another Spelling TV remake, ""The Mod Squad"" failed. ""Mod Squad"" took itself so darn seriously, you wondered why anyone wanted to make the film in the first place, or if the original TV show was so down, why do it again.

It's a fun movie, not made out to take itself too seriously.  The Matrix like FX were easy on the eyes and the somewhat stale and corny story line only made the film funnier....It really didn't take itself that serious.You can't leave this film expecting a tour de force like American Beauty or Being John Malkovich.

The comedy and action within this film is not adequately blended together, as it is in so many of the James Bond movies. Rather, the two are separated from one another, resulting in a schizophrenic mixture of two genres. What's more, the comedy side of the equation isn't really all that funny. The action, on the other hand, is first-class. The filmmakers managed to incorporate techniques used in other movies, including bullet-time from The Matrix. In this regard, the movie is satisfying, but this still doesn't solve the question, ""Is this an action or a comedy flick?""

I have never been so wrong before in my life.The acting was extremely poor with the exception of Bill Murray. The writing was horrid. Nome of the three girls were ""beautiful"" as they were described at the beginning of the film. Cameron Diaz was the only passably attractive girl there. Lucy Liu should really hear about this new invention we call CLOTHING, and Drew Barrymore is just ugly no matter how much lipstick you put on her or how much you digitally airbrush her figure.

All amplified in a sleek, visual, comic design by director McG.8 out of 10.  2 points lost cause Bill Murray is wasted : all his scenes lack the wise ass cleverness we come to expect ( except for his soap gun - I laughed at that ) and every scene with Tom Green - Drew loves the guy, but his two scenes brings the film to crashing halts : 'Is it the Chad?'

At certain moments, you don't relate to anybody or anything and you feel alone in this world. We all experience that feeling every now and then. One of the times I felt I was from another planet took place inside a theater, and I was watching, despite my resistance, this movie. I was among a cheering, laughing crowd.You might think I was prejudiced. Wrong. Knowing for sure that this movie wasn't my cup of tea, I prepared myself for getting everything I could from it. ""I wish it contains action, I wish I can laugh"" I was thinking. Well, the only thing I got was an awful need of walking out.This movie is so downright bad I don't know where to start: First, this is not ""Charlie's Angels"". Aside from the fact that three girls are the main characters and they happen to follow the orders from a man called Charlie, there's nothing more in common. All similarities end at that. This movie should be called ""Three girls and their dumb everyday life"" or something like that. But even retitled, this movie would stink. And this affirmation takes me to the next mega-flaws.Second, the three girls are stupid. The Cameron Diaz character borders on retarded. But not in a funny way. She's plain stupid and acts like a nerd. I know that is supposed to be funny. Maybe for a 5 year old it is.Third, there is no actual plot, just a badly made up excuse for linking pitiful sketches together. This movie could have lasted 30 minutes or 6 hours. It feels disjointed. It's nothing more than a sucession of sketches.Fourth, the soundtrack. Argh!. I can't even think of it without getting angry. Who in the world made that compilation, a 17 year old boy? It's the most lazy soundtrack in movie history. Every time there's an action/fight scene, some random hip-hop/metal is thrown, even though the song belongs to another emotional planet. It really sounds like someone would have put together a list of last years' most topical hits and played it randomly. The inclusion of Korn's ""Blind"" in an action scene can be called blasphemy.Fifth, the action scenes. Over the top, boring, we've seen them all before.Sixth, the pace. This movie simply hasn't. It's a steady sucession of boring action and poor jokes. Don't expect a climax. This is LINEAR. Urgh.As I know there is a word limit, I won't go on. But I could speak easily about 20 awful things in this movie, without thinking too hard.Wait, there's something good.

281,jesussaysohyeahtokungfu,Biggest surprise,7,16 February 2006,"I was at my girlfriends with no movies she wanted to watch except a couple of video's brassed off, notting hill and Charlie's angels.....the latter two i always believed to be chick flicks and not really up my end of the street. Eventually we decided on putting Charlie's angels on...and i got ready for a couple hours kip......was i wrong! From the off a quirky joke keeps you amused and action starts straight away, now the greatest thing about this film aside from the supporting cast of actors, is the directors vision that people would see the film as 'cheesy' so the film has a tongue in cheek look to it where you can laugh with the director rather than at him.To refer back to my earlier statement about the supporting cast....it is fantastic, the biggest of them all being the legend 'Bill Murray' who plays Bosley and he never fails to bring a smile or make you laugh. 'Tom Green' is at his usual clownish self (i'm convinced he writes his own script lines?) and 'Matt LeBlanc' is natural playing an actor (like his role in friends so he has had enough practise) and boyfriend to 'Lucy Liu'. The girls themselves are fantastic and all look a bunch of fun to be around, 'Cameron Diaz' has innocent sex appeal while Drew and Lucy have kick ass sex appeal. so there is something for everyone! This is not a film that could have been done without a great director and amazing cast, having a bunch of nobodies would have looked the wrong sort of cheesy and not appealed to anyone, but to see your favourite Hollywood superstars having a laugh and plenty of fun is worth watching alone, this is not a must see, but defo a worth see if nothing else is on.........",Charlie's Angels
282,VerbalKint-2,"Corny, fluffy, brainless, and infinitely entertaining! 8/10",8,2 April 2001,"When I first heard about this show, I believe my thoughts were something along the lines of one of L.L. Cool J's lines in the movie's opening scene: ""Great...another movie from an old t.v. show.""  Having suffered through countless (and usually pointless) silver-screen updates of some of television's bigger hits, I was extremely skeptical.So, into the theater I went, fully expecting to be disappointed.  I figured the only saving graces of this film would be the fantastic figures of its three female leads.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  It had been a long, long time since I'd seen a film as fun, upbeat, silly and invigorating as this.  Charlie's Angels was, without a doubt, the most entertaining film of 2000.In a film without much of a plot, the performances are surprisingly good and fresh.The Angels:  Drew Barrymore as Dylan is the ultimate tom-boy, Lucy Liu's Alex is the definition of class and control, and Cameron Diaz lights up every frame she's in as Natalie, simultaneously graceful and ditzy.Bill Murray is Bill Murray, which is a very good thing.  His Bosley is very funny, and very charming.  Sam Rockwell is a chameleon, Kelly Lynch comes off as an incredibly strong woman, and Tim Curry plays an excellent villain.Which reminds me...the most unforgettable performance in this movie belongs to Crispin Glover as Thin Man.  Without a single line of dialogue, he manages to steal every scene he's in.  His mannerisms and expressions made me fully believe that he was Thin Man.  The way he held those cigarettes...*shudders*The direction is very good, especially for a first time feature director like McG.  He draws influences from a lot of different films and filmmakers, but his style remains very unique.  This movie is also well shot, thanks to D.P. Russell Carpenter.What of the action?  Well, you've probably already heard that it's incredible.  And everyone who says that is absolutely right.  The girls were apparently put through several months of intense strength, martial arts and wire training, and it shows.I've given this film an 8 out of 10.  The only places in which Charlie's Angels loses points with me are in the half-baked plot and the over-baked villains.  Both end up being cliches, which may have been the point given the plausibility and originality of the plots and villains in the television series.  Here, though, they only manage to slightly detract from this otherwise wonderful effort.",Charlie's Angels

But this movie is not sure whether it's a comedy, an action or a mystery and it fails to deliver on all counts. If it's only for the women (Like the original was) how come there is so little nudity? There was more nudity on the Aaron Spelling tv show in the '70s!The only reason to see this movie is Crispin Glover. He's at his best in a non-speaking but very cool role.

It works wonderfully!The three leads, Lucy liu, Drew Barrymore, and Cameron Diaz each fill there role perfectly and with more subtlety and confidence than in the original movie.  The new Bosely, Bernie Mac, does an excellent job and the writer does an entertaining job of telling us how this new Bosely comes to inhabit the role previously played by Bill Murray.  I for one hope they keep the 'Bosely Rotation' thing up as it will add an interesting bit of the unknown and hopefully keep each movie fresh.In short this is a very well done action/comedy film that I would highly recommend.final rating: 4/5",Charlie's Angels

Maybe it was cool then, maybe it actually worked then, not now though. Some of the awkwardness is just because of the ""funny"" jokes put in, not really laughable.

289,regienaldg-283-237153,Action meets Fantasy meets Sci-Fi meets Adventure meets etc. equals Not a Good Movie,1,25 July 2012,"There are genres you can classify a movie into. There's action, adventure, sci-fi, thriller, suspense, comedy, romance, rom-com, mystery, family, etc. And a movie is classified into one or three genres because they clearly and cleverly exhibit the characteristic of such genre. An action movie is something that focuses on a conflict that results to a clash of physical forces. An adventure is one that focuses on encounters with another world. A sci-fi is a movie that deals with scientifically-based conflicts. And so forth (I am not discussing types of movie genre but I just needed to refer back to these references later for the sake of argument).With all that said, I have to say that I cannot seem to identify which genre this movie belongs to. Action, it could be... but there is too much exaggeration in all of the fight scenes and nothing seemed realistic. Every action movie has at least one realistic fight but this movie has none. I am personally practicing a form of defense fighting and it totally annoys me to see a lot of non-sense forms of fighting used in this movie. They are not even effective in real fights! This may lead one to speculate that this movie can be classified as fantasy because of all the not-so-realistic action scenes. However, this can't be fantasy because the setting is in our real world and that is the irony because nothing is even realistic in this movie. Sci-fi, I don't think so because some events even violated the laws of science (eg: too much flying, flipping, all those unbelievable stunts). Adventure, definitely not because there is nothing adventurous in all the characters' encounter.Another flaw of this movie is the main characters. Their behaviors made me believe that those ladies are acting smart and intellectual when actually they are dumb. There is also too much posing and unnecessary acts that even silly people don't do. There was never an intelligent conversation in this movie.Bottom line, if you are a serious movie goer, don't take this movie seriously or you'll end up very frustrated you'll want to tear this movie. Don't even watch it if your intent is to feel good. This is not a feel-good movie. Watch it if and only if you want to get silly.",Charlie's Angels

I thought the writing was fun, the plot was amazingly well developed and the fight scenes were just stunning.  It held true to the orginal shows idea with a modern update without overdoing it, or expecting too much from it.  It was perfect for what it was suppose to be.  Fun, Action, Women in charge, Hair and clothes!  The only thing I was disapointed by was that none of the orginal angels made appearences... They should have shown their support.

They definitely were taking advantage of the looks of Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore.  In fact, it was so over the top, you have to realize that's what they are spoofing!I couldn't count all the stereotypes that you see in this movie.  It's not meant to be great cinema.  It's meant to entertain.  I don't need to watch the movie 20 times to decypher its message.  So, for entertainment value, I give it 7 out of 10 stars.",Charlie's Angels

Its a shame that the new millenium has to start out by shamelessly borrowing from old TV shows.  I like a good parody when I see one (Naked Gun, Hot Shots!, etc.) but this film was so cheesy and predictable.  The part about Drew Barrymore missing a bullet was ridiculous.  Everything about the movie was awful.  See this at the risk of having your intelligence insulted. What's next?  Dukes of Hazard the movie starring Tom Cruise and George Clooney and Cameron Diaz as Daisy??  Enough with the TV show parody, its not funny any more.

So if the special effects are being complained about (which i enjoyed, i thought they were very funny because of the matrix, and i thought it was put in at the right time) then think about it this way, its not a movie that's going to put you at the end of your seat waiting for what's going to happen next. Its a movie that allows you to relax, and get in a few laughs here and there, and the general idea of the movie. I thought it was funny, well written, well acted, and well directed.

297,cookedw,Great take on action movies,8,15 November 2000,"The reviews here seem to be taking this movie too seriously for its own good.  If you look at this as another action movie, it's really quite pathetic.  Some of the hand-to-hand stuff is decent, but the Matrix sequences really do detract from the action alot, the slowdown taking the energy away from everything.  The nice thing about this film is that it definitely does not take itself seriously, and neither should the viewer. This movie pokes fun of itself and action movies in general.  There is not one serious, emotional scene.  There is no point to all of the nonsense, and it gratuitously mocks the Matrix.  It throws in some James Bond music, a scene directly out of True Lies, one out of Austin Powers, a comic take on a scene from the Great Escape, not to mention all the film connections I probably missed.  The director's take on this film wasn't to make an action film -- it was to make something fun and entertaining.  The clearly gratuitous shots of the sexy women, the flips of the hair, the unnecessary slow-mo, all of these point to a movie that was trying to be as ridiculous as possible.  Unlike c**p like the Matrix, which claims to have a (shallow) purpose, Charlie's Angels serves only to amuse.  Some of the gags were a bit overused, but all in all, this was an extremely entertaining and completely pointless entertainment piece -- which is exactly what it was trying to be.It is the quintessential Hollywood blockbuster, except it's smart and funny. And even Tom Green was amusing.  7/10",Charlie's Angels

But looking at the classic 1970s and 1980s TV show, you have to say that this movie was strictly made for movie gross and money. It has little resemblance to the TV show and is more of a mockery instead of a movie. I hope this doesn't foreshadow to more silly movies based on TV shows because I hope NYPD Blue nor The Practice have such poor followings.

304,palm21,Another television remake....,7,20 December 2000,"Yes, it is true(sadly), scriptwriters have finally run out of ideas and now they are converting all the old televisions series into movies. If done properly this can be fun(Mission: Impossible). But what about this movie? Charlie's Angels is just what it pretends to be: A fast packed fun action movie. The martial arts scenes are fun to watch and well choreographed. For some reasons the scenes involving Crispin Glover as ""The Thin Man"" remind me strongly of the Darth Maul scenes from Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, but maybe this was done intentionally. It is also obvious that some scenes were explicitely ripped from other popular movies from the last decade(The Matrix and Mission: Impossible for example). Also the actress that plays Vivian Wood(Kelly Lynch) reminds me strongly of Madeline from the Nikita series. As usual within the Charlie's Angel's series the movie is a little over the top, but never becomes annoying. All three of the actresses play their respective parts well, but none really stands out(which would spoil the movie, since they are supposed to be all equal). Bill Murray is funny as usual, but seems to be getting old fast(he's not half as funny as in Ghostbusters for instance). The special effects are done well, but none of them are really spectacular. The music really adds something to the movie. Blind by Korn really improves the martial arts scenes. Conclusion: This movie is fun to watch , but also predictable.

What really makes the film work is the charisma ( & physical charms )of the 3 leading ladies, combined with well-choreographed action sequences and the tongue-in-cheek script.

Michael Jordan in his heyday should have been so fortunate! At least in the Matrix, the charachters had an explanation for how they could hang in the air.  To me, this makes the movie a ridiculous joke.  I'm not anal, I know there are certain things we as an audience are supposed to overlook as being impossible but this was just  too much!  It looked totally stupid!  That goes for Jet Li and his antics in Romeo Must Die also. There has been way too much computer trickery and editing in fight scenes nowadays and I am not the only one who thinks this.  A lot of people are sick of these ""fake"" and unrealistic fight scenes.  Also, if I see one more movie where there's an explosion and an actor or actors are walking away from it with their backs turned and they don't even flinch, I am going to be sick.

309,Mikeylito,When is a comic strip not a comic strip?,6,23 December 2000,"When is a comic strip not a comic strip?When it's Charlie's Angels, the movie follow-up to the series of the 80's. This time around, the Angels are Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, and Cameron Diaz. Go-between and sidekick John Bosley is none other than the irrepressible Bill Murray.Clearly, the architects of this film intended it to be self-lampooning and the movie definitely comes off as cartoonish.  The ladies are able, capable, and without, really, the need for men in their lives.  They depend on themselves and each other.  And, like their television counterparts before them, they really have only one want, need, and desire: to meet their boss, Charlie Townsend, voiced now as in the past, by John Forsythe.Forsythe as the unseen Townsend is the only connection to the past, other than that of producer Leonard Goldberg.  There are no allusions to the Angels of the past, or of the former Bosley.  Just as well.  Other than the formula of three women detectives working for an unseen boss, there really are no connections to the series.Actually, the feel of the film seems to owe more to James Bond than to Charlie's Angels.  It opens on an airplane where an apparent bomber meets his apparent contact, Mr. Jones, played by LL Cool J.  Their interaction leads to a Bond-like opening sequence that establishes the Angels and their penchant for teamwork and danger.  An updated opening, akin to the series' `once upon a time' billboard, follows.What follows is the meat, so to speak, of the film.  There's a computer industrialist (Sam Rockwell) who has been kidnapped by his nemesis, Roger Corwin (Tim Curry).  The industrialist's partner, Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch), hires Townsend and the Angels to retrieve the industrialist and his software, which has been hijacked by his competitor.There are few surprises in the film, authored by Ryan Rowe (The Love Bug), Ed Solomon (Men In Black), and John August (Titan A.E.), save for one or two and, if you think hard -- I did -- you can guess the direction of the film's plot.  There are some casting surprises, though, like the aforementioned appearance of LL Cool J.  Luke Wilson, Matt LeBlanc, and Tom Green lend their comic talents to the mix.  However, the plot line is so thin that you'd do best to just sit back and enjoy the endless action that unreels before you on the screen.It's no coincidence that this movie is one hour, 38 minutes long.  With commercials, there's just enough of a film to fit a two-hour TV-movie time slot.  Which is probably where this movie belonged in the first place.My score: 5.5",Charlie's Angels

To be honest, that's pretty much the only reason I rented it, watching these 3 beauties for 90 minutes was far more appealing than watching Dennis Norden host yet another ""hilarious"" series of clips which we've all seen before (sorry, americans you'll have no idea what I was talking about there)Anyway, I wasn't prepared for such a slick and well put together film, the action sequences were gloriously over the top, lots of that silly Matrix type stuff, which can look good in the right hands (I agree with one of the previous posters, the Matrix is a terrible film, and an insult to anyones intelligence)Is this film an insult to intelligence ? on the face of it, you would think so, but the whole film gently parodies it's genre and most importantly itself, you're not supposed to take this film seriously - that's the point.What a great way to spend 90 minutes (remember I thought it was going to be a load of old Pony) definitely one for the lads - would the girls like it ? - probably not, it would only remind you of how much cellulite you have before asking your boyfriend the inevitable question ""How come you never look at ME like that ?""

Even though the heroes of the movie are three females, they kick plenty of butt. The critics were hard on the movie, and I don't know why. The movie was suppose to be cheesy because it was based on a cheesy hit TV show. I'm tired of people who are always looking for a deep plot and realistic circumstances in every movie they go to see.

The only thing we could have hoped to save this movie were the Matrix-type shooting of fight scenes and the consistently funny performance of Bill Murray, who the director left out of much of the film.Many people have at least recognize that the film, as far as writing and acting, was not to be taken seriously and the only thing you were supposed to be paying attention to were the beautiful women and the fast paced action scenes.  But I can not begin to understand how anyone could give this film any credit at all.First of all, Drew Barrymore gives a horrible performance as Dylan.  Cameron Dias, whose work I have enjoyed in many other films, gives as equally an annoying performance as Drew Barrymore.  And Lucy Liu is no better than the rest.  The only thing I can say is, the cast relied too much on their director.  In fact, the only person I could stand in the film was Bill Murray.Even with the action scenes, the movie is terrible and the action does not help at all.

322,paloma-4,"fluff, but fun",7,4 November 2000,"Charlie's Angels has never taken itself incredibly seriously, and it is not starting now.  And that's why I liked it.  Though similar to the original (Charlie is still the incomparable John Forsythe, and the three leading ladies still kick ass), this version of Charlie's Angels is a notch higher than the original in the action sphere.  The amazing special effects were enough to keep my rapt attention and were somewhat reminiscent of The Matrix.  I'll admit, the plot was not exactly original, but I don't think the makers of the film ever intended it to be the centerpiece.  I think that this movie was meant to showcase powerful women doing extraordinary and fascinating moves.  And fascinate they did (albeit half naked...I guess that was to bring in the male viewer.)  The actresses all played their parts perfectly, with the right combination of strength and whimsy.  The triumverate had great chemistry and played well with Bill Murray, who turned in another brilliant comic side-kick performance. (He's getting good at that.  See Wild Things for another similar performance.)  The villians were all a bit one demensional, but again I think that this effect was intentional in a movie that is more about eye candy and being a charicature of itself that it is about plot and character development.  While I expected it to be somewhat lacking in seriousness, I was pleased to see that the makers purposely set out to create this effect, creating a movie that has fun with itself.  For proof of this, just watch the scenes of what the Angels did pre-Charlie.

The special effects are far too over-used, and most of them look like being stolen from other flicks, matrix for example. Another thing is the humor. I like a funny movies, and action plus comedy CAN make a good mix, but the humor in this one seems far too dumb and not very funny at all to me.

I know that the TV series had some of the same shortcomings, but it was free, and at least the jiggle/sex appeal quotient was higher. None of these angels could hold a candle to the originals.

Lucy Liu doesn't work without her Ally McBeal nastiness. Drew Barrymore needs to learn to distinguish between good (Ever After) from bad (this turkey and the hideous ""Never Been Kissed"").

""Millions of dollars were spent making a movie that does not elevate the level of culture, awareness, and in fact only increase the collective mindlessness of entire generations.""  Maybe.  Maybe movies, books,TV shows and all art forms should exist not only to entertain, but also elevate us in a way, and make us question ourselves about the human condition and our future as a race and a civilization.
 Or maybe, just maybe...it should just be  about FUN.
 This is easily the most FUN movie I have seen in a while.The best? No. The one with the most moving performances? No. The one that made me question myself about my place in this universe? No. The one with the most surprising plot twists? No. But, man,was it FUN!
 And this movie, with its stunning leading ladies, amazing stunts and special effects, and funny lines and outrageous situations was just...FUN. I forgot about all of my worries and I was entertained and totally engrossed by the movie.
 Bottom line, the movie going public needs movies like this who are pure escapism- well done and unpretentious-as much as we need movies that are allegedly ""about something"", for the mind, like every part of the body, needs to rest.
 So, if you are an educated scholar who would rather see obscure French philosophical/psychological dramas about self centered 60 year old men cheating on their 35 year old wives with 19 year old girls, you might not enjoy this movie. But if you do, don't feel bad, it's okay. It was made so you could enjoy it. So, just enjoy it.

They were more like female versions of James Bond than female versions of Jackie Chan.  I didn't think that much of the comedy was that good (although Tom Green was okay playing himself) but I know that some liked it.  You also better skip this one for acting. There are only two good actors in this film; Crispin Glover and Tim Curry. Has anyone else noticed the spacey look that comes across Drew Barrymore's face while she is acting in this film because it makes all of her lines seem forced.  so the only reason that I can't (with good conscience) give this one star is because of Tim Curry and Crispin Glover.

The story is all too forseeable, the characters - especially the bad guys - are pretty lame and all the action sequences look like something you have seen before (and better). And still, watching it I had a ball. It was the film's attitude that won me over: ""Let's grab every action movie cliché we can get hold of and try to have a little fun with it."" In other words: the whole film isn't taking itself too serious. And that worked for me. All the computer aided high-kicking would have been rather boring, but when Cameron Diaz tries to maintain a romantic conversation over the cell phone in the middle of a fight - that's funny.

I haven't been this disappointed in a film since ""End of Days"", and that was a much better film. But it wasn't as bad as ""The Avengers"".

But the film has very interesting effects and visuals, lots of humor, and enough charm from all the major characters that it's hard to pay attention to the flimsy plot and unrealistic situations.

But let me tell you one thing, Charlie's Angels has one aim only: to be a crowdpleaser. Charlie is going to rule theaters this autumn, and should be around much longer than ""Meet the Parents"". The action left me breathless, and those actresses, they pleased the eyes so much they had me begging. Bill Murray was good in his scenes, Cameron D., Lucy Liu, and Drew did a great job. They enjoyed making this film and it shows. The camaraderie isn't forced, and each angel is given their time to shine. I saw maybe one and a half episodes of Charlie's Angels, but I'd see this movie again and again. Hardly no blood (good for the kids), but lots of babes and lots of skin (you decide whether it's good for the kids; at the right age, it may even be helpful), and lots of butt-kicking.

I read some complaints here about how there was less nudity than in the series that inspired it. Frankly I wasn't looking for pornography, so three sexy chicks was all right with me. The movie's action scenes were obviously inspired by the Matrix, but the two movies simply can't be compared: one lolly pop fun, the other cyber-punk. These action scenes are impressive, but admittedly a little bit overdone. I can't quite give it a perfect score, even when considering it does not pretend to be the new Citizen Kane.  Some of the jokes are not very funny, and they get more and more embarrassing after each new viewing.

Pure entertainment.  This movie was pure entertainment.  No substance; no sentimental value that you'll go home with making you feel all warm and fuzzy toward the rest of the world... No.  It's simply there for our enjoyment.  Critics fail to see this.  They seem to believe that if a movie doesn't make people think about why they like it, it isn't any good.What makes this movie so entertaining, you ask?  Well, simple.  Key elements.  Action, comedy, special effects, good acting, and good music. Some (Maybe I should say most...) will argue that these are not all the key elements you need to have an entertaining movie.  But it works for me.  The action sequences are unbelievable.  A combination of (although not to hold a candle to) ""The Matrix"", a Bruce Lee movie, and the secret agent man himself, James Bond.  Slow motion bullets, kicks, and (yes...) back flips. 
Barrymore, Diaz, and Liu were definitely the best picks for this film. Three beautiful women who know kung fu?  Yes sir...  Bill Murray is his usual hysterical self as Bosley, providing most of the laughs.  Crispin Glover plays a magnificent villain.  He even has his own theme song! (For those of you who haven't seen this film yet, you probably don't get my joke about the critics 'smacking up'; but you will...)To be blunt, and to bring this to an end, go see the film.

I was worried there would be overkill with The Chad but there wasn't, The Chad was only in the movie enough to make it funny, no overkill (chest hair sandwich anyone?).  I usually find Tom Green's humor stupid but in this movie he was funny.  Bill Murray was funny, great, stupid, you name it.  He wittles a gun out of ivory soap, where/how did he get the soap?  It was weird stuff like this in the movie that made it unbelievable but yet funny. Hearing an unusual bird call and knowing that bird only exists in one place helping the angles find Bosley is another stupid yet funny scene in the movie.  This movie pokes fun at 70's style TV.  When the movie first started I was thinking who would play Jill, Sabrina, and Kelly.  When each angel had a different name that took the movie in a totally different direction for me.  It was like good, they aren't mirroring the show entirely but giving this movie it's own character identity separate from the TV show.  I am a big Charlie's Angels fan from the 70's.  I was one of the millions of teens who had the Farrah poster on his bedroom wall (the pose with her on all fours in her bathing suit).  I enjoyed this movie for it's pure entertainment value only not expecting a serious movie.  This was much more of a comedy than a mystery or drama.  I rated this movie 8 out of 10.  I laughed so hard at Cameron dancing around her apartment in her underroos with the UPS guy arriving at her door.

At the time, it didn't strike me as something worth $10 to go see. Well it finally came out on cable, and having watched the whole thing, I can tell you the most tolerable scenes were in fact in the trailer. In retrospect, I think the best way I could have watched this movie was to have the TV turned off, but kept the sound system and cable left on, so that I could listen to the great soundtrack, without the annoying visuals. But unfortunately, I watched the whole thing from start to finish. The fact that I didn't spend $10 to see it wasn't enough to placate this feeling I had that I had somehow been cheated. Now you might be wondering, if this movie was so bad, why did you watch it until the end? That is a very good question, because I have walked out of bad movies before, or fell asleep half way through them. I guess the reason I watched it until the end, was because I wanted to see how much worse it could get. I think I wanted to establish a new low - a point of reference of how bad a movie could be. The previous title holder was `Howard the Duck', but Charlie's Angels makes that one seem Oscar-worthy. Let me just say, I love spy thriller movies like James Bond and True Lies. I also like funny spy movies like Austin Powers 1&2. I even like movie versions of popular TV series like Mission Impossible 1&2. But this one - I'm not even sure what this one is.

Love the one liners. ' Was it the Chad?' ' No the Chad was great'Diaz as Natalie has a smile that's wider than the Jokers and its could be the darkest coldest Wettest day of your life and Natalies Character could make you smile and see that there is plenty of sunshine out there.
I love tickets too Nat.It's never going to win a Oscar. But there are plenty of action Comedies that try too hard to be funny and you are finding it hard to find the humour. This one for me is a Oscar winner for popcorn fun and action, with music that works perfectly with each scene.

But let's get into it shall we? This movie is the embodiment of my childhood because I watched it so much hahaha. I love this movie whole heartedly because there's just something wholesome and fun about it. It's not supposed to be taken seriously and tbh, they don't take themselves seriously. It's over the top, cheesy and hyper sexualized but it's hella fun to watch and lots of action and a good, nay, AMAZING soundtrack. This movie is extremely nostalgic for me for the early 2000's. Do I think it was the most amazing movie I've ever watched? I mean maybe, just kidding, no and do I think part of my love for this film has to do with my childish love of it growing up? Maybe but even watching it as an adult, I still find it so much fun that I could watch over and over. If ya don't like it, it's just cause you're analyzing and thinking too far into it. Don't.

I found the movie to have a great sense of humor (spoofing itself) and the stylized action sequences were great. Bill Murray was outstanding as Bosley and the ""Thin Man"" villain was unique. I won't really bother with the plot because the plot is not why you would go to see this movie. My only problem with this movie was the ""matrix"" like action went on too long. I was not expecting anything close to reality from this movie, however, even in a state of suspended disbelief, I had trouble. In this movie not one of three angels has access to a gun or weapon of any kind??? Interesting in this day and age! Can't women carry secret gadgets? Is this some kind of union rule?

Err, yes it is.Charlie's Angels did something that few movies ever do for me anymore, it actually surprised me by being much better than I expected. I expected absolute big budget blah and was just crossing my fingers that Bill Murray would be funny. While the film could have used more Bill Murray I was blown away by the way the film was put together. It is still big budget summer eye candy flick (err, its october) but it manages to be FUN which is something that a lot of the so-called summer blockbusters this year have forgotten to be.The film clear mocks itself and the original series while timing their action sequences to a rockin' (and quirky-but in a good way) soundtrack while playing out Matrix-like visuals. What results is a movie that is absolutely wonderful for just kicking back, laughing, saying ""cool"" every once in awhile, oh and of course gawking at the three main stars. With a host of complementary side characters (Crispin Glover a.k.a. George McFly is particularly cool) that add to the zaniness of this universe that the film has created, you will definitely never once get bored or for that matter stop to think about the intricacies of the plot or characters. But hell, you wont care. It doesnt slow down enough for you to think how impossible some of it is, but who cares?Unless you only like your movies slow, moody, and dark, you should go off and see these chicks kick some ass crack some jokes and beat up George McFly in super-slo-mo.",Charlie's Angels
374,sttia,Charming Cheese!!!,10,3 November 2000,"I thought this movie was great. Diaz, Liu and Barrymore were all exquisitely funny. Although a little cheesy at times, this movie showed the heroines in their best light. The laughter was always at the right moment. It was as if the roles they portrayed were made for them specifically because they fit so well into what the public sees them as, ie: Barrymore, sexual and goofy: Liu, dominant and goofy: Diaz, sweet and goofy. Bill Murry as Bosley was dead on in the part. Crispin Glover was a ominous lurking bad guy and very convincing. Sam Rockwell who played the bad guy in The Green Mile still gives me the creeps with ease as Knox. This movie was better than I thought it would be. I was expecting a major 70's retro Austin Powers type movie but was charmed by a 21st century update of the original series. The martial arts were action packed but a little too over done with the slow motion effects. All in all, money well spent. I see a sequel coming and I will be there watching.",Charlie's Angels
375,AlanK-9,"Too few diamonds, too much rough",2,9 June 2003,"Charlie's Angels is a remake of the 70s series, buy beyond having three female characters in the role of ""special detectives"" that work for a guy named Charlie and a sidekick named Bosley, the resemblance seems to end there. But then, few modern movie rehashes are faithful, so I shan't harp on that point too much.Let's start with the few good parts. The women are beautiful, naturally. Their characters are not as bad as you might think. I think Natalie (Diaz) and Dylan (Barrymore) have some depth to them, and I thought that the juxtaposition of Natalie's real life to her crimefighting life made for some interesting and humorous scenes. Alex (Liu) comes across as the weakest character.The action scenes were intense, but it was here that I began to wrinkle my nose. The action scenes suffer from serious matrix envy. Right now, filming stop action sequences like this are all the rage, but resorting to every visually interesting special effects gimmick at the drop of a hat seem desperate and out of place in the film.The main villain is, well, unconvincing and annoying, and display an over-the-top ""hipper than thou"" attitude that totally shatters any sense of fear or believability in the character. The adrenaline soundtrack and pop-culture references that pervade the movie means that the movie itself also bleeds the same hipper-than-thou attitude.Finally, the movie features the desperately un-funny Tom Green desperately trying to be funny in his all-too-frequent appearances as ""Chad.""In the final analysis, the film tries to be cute, hip, funny, and action packed, but all of those elements trip over one another in what is little more than an assault on the senses.",Charlie's Angels

The humor is satirical, taking advantage of the corny elements of the original series. The action sequences were incredible, but not too much (see MI:2), and added to the storyline instead of overpowering it.Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Lui all were fantastic in their roles. You couldn't help but falling in love with each angel. Take down your Farrah posters, its time for the new girl.

403,mattlodder,"Take it for what it is, not what you think it should be...",9,12 December 2000,"This year I have seen a number of great movies. I've also seen some real howlers. Charlie's Angels has both feet firmly in the first category, and is easily one of the best movies of it's genre, ever.Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, it's slickly produced. But, unlike so many recent films to which that description could be easily applied (Hollow Man, The Cell), Angels is so obviously aware of it's own blatant ridiculousness. For this, it is to be applauded. Sitting through MI:2, another 70's action-based TV show turned into a slick, effects-driven third-millennial movie, you get the horrible feeling that the directors really believed they could turn a ridiculous, campy TV show into some deep and meaningful social critique. No such high-brow pretentiousness in this film - from the opening scene, which slots in a barely-audible conciously self-mocking one-liner, all the way through every clever reference and spoofed scene, through every pointless chase and exaggerated fight-scene, through every nodding innuendo, predictable plot twist and traditional baddie, McG and his cast have made a film which acknowledges all the tongue-in-cheek sass and cheesiness present in the original.70s TV cop shows, of which Angels was perhaps the perfect example, revelled in their lack of plot but enormous amount of explosions, random car chases and beautiful characters. The clichés in this film are not lazily slotted in through lack of invention, but deliberately sprinkled throughout to give the whole piece a knowing quality. Even the cinematography is deliberately plagiristic of the 70s TV show.In fact, Angels is nearly as referential as anything Kevin Smith has put his name to. Just check out Drew Barrymore's ET shirt for proof of that. I get the impression that alot of people were expecting a M:I2 style remake, and thus missed the point of this wonderful film.If you want a great Kung-fu movie, go rent ""Enter the Dragon"". If you want a deep and meaningful plot, ""Fight Club"" has just been released on DVD, and ""Dancer in the Dark"" is still in cinemas. If you want a day-glo cross between Mystery Men, Austin Powers and any James Bond movie you care to mention, all wrapped up in a stunning soundtrack (NOT replicated on the CD, sadly) and very modern effects, go see Charlie's Angels.Seriously, if you have any memories at all of Farrah Fawcett and her high-kicking pals, you'll adore this film.

404,davidobviously,Worst porno ever,2,9 September 2001,"And I say porno because all it is is slo mo shots of the ""angels"" mincing around like they were in some kind of Baywatch out-takes show. The jokes are awful, Cameron Diaz in particular is mahogany-esque. Bill Murray does his usual funny guy stuff, and as usual is fairly (but not very) funny, but he's been doing this for so long it's hard to tell if he's conscious. So, all in all, it's dull, predictable, and one more thing - just because a film knows it's bad doesn't suddenly make it good.",Charlie's Angels
405,dan-j-rooke,A really dire film.,1,8 May 2006,"I apologise to the fans of this film - but I really didn't like it.To me it was typical of the Hollywood conveyor belt film factory.I'm not too familiar with the TV series - but I had seen a bit. The film wasn't really anywhere near similar. Yes it had feisty lasses taking on the tyranny of the world (kind of) - but that was it.It took itself far too seriously. In points it looked like it was lampooning itself - but it wasn't.Twas transparent and lacklustre. The acting was mediocre - but to be honest, I don't blame the actors. I blame the script for being so void of character.It was obvious that the film was selling on the back of the title. I can imagine a board of men sat round a table with a tick-list of things they want in it : ""I want skimpy outfits, fighting which shows off the girl's 'assets', some nice cars, and just wing the rest."" Poo, absolute poo.",Charlie's Angels
406,linkslinks2,Whats going on?,4,14 July 2006,"The older Charlies angels series was supposed to be a serious one if I can remember it correctly. However, despite so much contemplation I still have'nt figured out of this lame movie is a really a parody or spoof or are the characters really supposed to act that way for real, making for quite a weird movie? McG (where did he come from?) must have been totally stoned when doing this movie. Thats exactly how it looks and feels. For purely entertainment purposes, there isn't much to say either. It may end up giving you a headache instead of giving you the satisfaction of efficiently wasting 2 hrs. There are one or two good moments but the utter ridiculousness of this movie takes over eventually. Is this also the billionth time that Prodigy's ""Smack my B*tch up"" song has been reused in a movie or show?",Charlie's Angels

This film is about as far from this category as possible... BUT, and this is a BIG BUT, I enjoyed it a lot. After 5 minutes I found myself sitting like a moron with a smile on my face... this film is fun and the 3 angels seem to be having the time of their lives. I felt relaxed and happy watching it. Diaz is cool and Lucy Liu... wow. When it finished, rather than thinking about a complicated plot I stood up, did a karate kick, pulled a muscle in my back and thought 'I want to be an angel'. 8/10.. might have given it 9 but Chad was useless and annoying.",Charlie's Angels
408,Hars,Cute chicks saying and doing the stupidest things but looking great while doing it! SPOILERS,3,11 July 2001,"The real plot summary of this movie is: THREE CUTE CHICKS SAYING AND DOING THE STUPIDEST THINGS BUT LOOKING GREAT WHILE DOING IT! Like Alex (Lucy Liu) that climbed a mountain and then to a helicopter wearing high heels!Action movies always abund in wisecracks at the most inadequate times but this one really beats them all. One of the bad guys runs from the ""angels"" and Alex (Lucy Liu) goes: ""Why do they always have to run?"" A dialog can´t get any worse than that, I thought! But then Vivian (Kelly Lynch) goes: ""Never send a man to do a woman´s job."" Oh, please!!! Or in the middle of a cat fight, Natalie (Cameron Diaz) telling Vivian: ""Do you know how hard it is to find a quality man in Los Angeles?"" Who cares?! She´s already made her point by staying on the phone with the guy while both her life and Bosley´s as well as the whole mission were at stake. To see more things that ruined this great idea read the ""goofs"" section and also the ""memorable quotes"".It just seems hard to believe that the creators of the tv-series would write the script for this... mock of the series!Then the cast! Lucy Liu as a fragile little woman baking muffins?! I don´t think so! Or Drew Barrymore saying ""And that´sss kicking your assss!"" And I´m sure the guys loved the shaking butt of Cameron Diaz but it didn´t do anything for me. As for the bad guys... only Vivian (Kelly Lynch) was convincing. Tom Green was the only good choice as Chad and the only fun in the movie as far as I´m concerned. As for Matt LeBlanc, I´m looking forward to seeing him in a role other than that of a ""bad actor-good lover"".The only good thing about this movie - besides ""the Chad"" - was the surprising soundtrack! I would´ve never imagined I could hear Sir Mix-A-Lot or Prodigy in a big Hollywood production!",Charlie's Angels
409,psguzzo,Great all around Action Motion Picture,10,16 August 2002,One of the greatest action movies of all time. I rank it up there with Mission Impossible 1. And what can I say about the musical coordination... The music was done and synced perfectly. I give McG the director a lot of credit and he really seems to know how to motivate and make his actors and actresses reach their full potential. First rate Movie and I cannot wait to see part 2 next year. Oh although all the acting was great Crispin Glover the Thin Man really stole the show to me. His energy and fighting skills were top of the line. And the electric scenes where he cut off the hair from the Angels the look on his face will be a classic scene of eroticism that pumps up the movie a few levels............... Way to go Crispin....,Charlie's Angels

When you think Charlie's Angels, you think of beautiful women solving crimes with both their brains and there beauty.  The women in the move were just horrible.  Diaz always looked tired and Drew isn't even close to cute. Then you add in a bunch of bad lines and poor acting and you have the movie in a nutshell.The movie isn't good enough to be taken as a serious attempt as action film and isn't funny enough to be a spoof.  In the end all you have is a movie that looks like the director watched last years big films (Austin Powers, Matrix, Mission Impossible, James Bond...) and tried to cobble together something to make a quick buck.",Charlie's Angels

It's corny with fake laughter happening all the time, but it works.  This is because the film knows what it is, a source of amusement and escapism. It never claims to be more, but boy does it deliver on the feel good factor! I came out of this movie feeling great about myself! It's sexy, funny, action packed fun, that doesn't allow boredom to even enter within a 10 mile radius of the audience. Constantly fresh and always exciting. How can you not like this movie? Diaz's dancing alone must be seen, not to mention Lucy's great fighting talents.

415,HieronymousMerkin,A great example of the many unoriginal Hollywood rip-offs aimed at stupid teenagers without girlfriends and taste in movies,1,23 May 2003,"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS.I've decided to write something about this film for one sole reason: I hate it and I think other people should be deterred from even thinking about wasting any amount of money into the pockets of whichever studio farted this abomination onto our screens. DON'T GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP ON SPEWING OUT FILMS LIKE THIS! Too late you fools: a sequel is already on the way. I was too late!It's a rip off and a waste of talent for most concerned. Which films to choose? Hmmm? How about 'The Matrix' (not just the style of wire work in fight scenes guys, THEY ACTUALLY USE BULLET TIME, badly), a 'Boogie Nights' style disco scene, 'Mission Impossible' acrobatics just before and during hacking into a computer, etc, etc, etc! Take it into account and if you actually watch this rubbish you will notice many more. And no its not a 'clever homage' to these great action/espionage thrillers, it is blatant and unsubtle stealing. ""Because er ..."" (Hollywood studio exec voice) ""aren't kids supposed to like this kinda stuff? What's that word ... er ... 'cool'? They think its cool don't they? See! the tasteless little brats actually watch it! We've made enough to make a sequel 'economically viable'. Great!"".No. Not great. Very bad. Sooo very bad.But don't get me wrong: these women are all beautiful and there are hyper sexy moments all round (Liu in a tight leather dominatrix style top and skirt brandishing a whip will have the spotty 15 year-olds and dodgy raincoat brigade wriggling in their seats), though their beauty is somewhat cheapened by the obvious and 'can you guess that I'm a music video director' efforts of Joseph 'McG' Nichol. Believe me that their showing of ass is far better than their kicking of it.The camera work is 'nice and colourful' (Brittany Spears video look - thank goodness they don't use her music!), fast studio editing and there isn't one original shot or sequence in the entire movie. The excellent Sam Rockwell and Tom Green are good but wasted, Diaz is talented (watch Being John Malkovich) but also wasted, Bill Murray is almost (but not quite) back to the comic standard of 'Kingpin' and opposite him Tim Curry tries valiantly to add some class to the movie.Great music is sometimes used: The Prodigy 'Smack My Bitch Up' is a brilliant choice for a kung-fu action scene (Wachowski brothers please take notice!), but is instead wasted on just another lacklustre Matrix rip-off fight by people who know that sort of thing is cool but can't understand why.Humour that is pathetic and falls flat on it's arse + a plot that is unoriginal and formulaic + acting talent that is wasted + action that is flabby + not an ounce of realism + a lot of money = 1 out of 10. If there were minus points on this rating system I'd use them.I laughed at some of the comments posted about this movie: if you believe them you'll be crying after this torture of a cinematic experience.

It is so dreadful that I cannot watch the whole thing at one time but have found myself having to shut it off and change channels after 20 minutes or so, only to come back and return to disbelief at watching its horrid resumption.

The arbitrary use of slow-motion robs the fight scenes of their urgency and reminds the viewer that this is merely a stunt show, not a story about characters fighting for their lives.The preview audience seemed to enjoy this movie, although they responded best to sequences that detoured from the main story, in particular a ""Soul Train"" dance number.",Charlie's Angels

'Charlie's Angels' generates no interest beyond how much popcorn is left in your carton.Yes, it's slick. Yes, it has action scenes that have been 'Matrix'-ed up. However -- the acting is uninspired, the characters are dull, the fight scenes are uninspirationally showy and have no meat, the plot is predictable down to every stupid piece of dialogue and scene change in the script (written, of course, by multiple writers)....

The movie doesn't have a really twisted plot line; it was made so that the viewer can have fun watching the movie. And it succeeds. It is fun to watch.

It was slick, fun, and kept the audience engaged during every scene.The fight scenes were incredible, and Bill Murray was superb. The most monumental point about the film though was the sheer elegance the female leads gave. Even when dressed in scuba equipment, they seemed to give off some kind of entrancing shine, and the magic of the film will be remembered for some time. If this doesn't sweep the MTV movie awards (as I'm sure the academy will pass this one over) I will be in shock. Toy Story 2?? What was that again??",Charlie's Angels

I don't buy it and don't tell me, "" well man its supposed to be corny.""  That is BULL!!  And you shouldn't buy into it either, because directing is an art and making a corny movie on purpose is every director or movie makers loop hole.  Anytime you hear "" well its supposed to be that way,"" that means that they hired the most mindless, gutless, dumbest cast and crew and just threw millions of dollars at the picture and assumed people would come to see it and judging by its rating, it worked.  I still don't buy it and you'll never find me making movies and sticking a horrible set of actresses on screen just so i can push their butts and chest into the camera and possibly capture those in the audience that invest thousands of dollars into radio equipment.

432,MLR1999-60896,My Favorite Movie of the year 2000 and a very misunderstood flick!,10,3 October 2021,"Charlie's Angels (2000) is one of my all time favorite movies ever. It stars the holy trinity actresses Cameron Diaz as Natalie, Drew Barrymore as Dylan and Lucy Liu as Alex. These 3 incredible women helped fought not only the bad guys (and bad girls) but also finished the assignment as a team successfully.Each of the 3 Angels had different characteristics. Natalie is a harmless, sweet and caring person. Also the life of the party. But if ever look at her wrong, she will whoop your behind. Dylan is a risk taking woman that loves to get her hands dirty, but got a great heart. Alex is very intelligent and takes her job seriously.The movie is fast paced and edgy. I believe that this film (and the 2003 sequel) is so underrated and misunderstood. Watching the movie now in 2021, yes the movie might not aged well nor was it self-aware, but what many people don't seem to realize is that back when it was released (2000), movies back then (depending on the movie) was not trying to take themselves too seriously. Pre PC/Social Media/Smartphone world. Films then had a lot more freedom with the storylines and the dialogues without offending the audiences. Although the movie is so cheesy, that's what makes it great IMO.In this day n age of all the craziness going on in the world right now, there needs to be a escapism when you watch a movie. And unfortunately majority of the movies in the last few years has been too serious and lack the fun and the innocence that most movies of the 2000s and older had.Every time I watch Charlie's Angels (2000), it never ever fails to make me put a big smile on my face. I enjoy every minute of it. This movie will always hold a special place in my heart and I am so grateful that we have films like this exists in the world.

435,corbrilliant,your basic cute girls beat up bad guys and save the day,1,5 April 2008,this movie was completely embarrassing. The acting was nothing like the original show and there was a lot of cheesy unneeded special effects. We all know that Lucy Lu is the only one with martial arts experience which made it unbearable to see Drew Barrymore and Camron Diaz fighting. What they should have done was got some real serious actresses taught them to fight to make the movie more believable. Kinda like how they did with Keana Reeves in the Matrix. There's really no need to comment on the sequel because it was worst than the first movie. A lot of extra extra cheesy special effects and impossible action sequences. this movie was a complete joke and should be erased from action movie history.,Charlie's Angels

Lucy Liu really shines as, what I think the best actress, with great flare, and energy. they are a great team and have won the best on screen team, proving so. Bosley also really shined, but the best actors in this movie were probably Cripen Glover, and Tim Curry.This is a great action movie although I will admit there are plotholes, and inconsistencies.  But who hasn't gone to and Schwarzinegger flick just to see some macho action, and no plot.  At least this movie gives it a shot.The intro to the movie, was really something.  It grabs your attention quickly, and swiftly.  Although this might look like some Matrix rip-off it is definetly not so.  it is definetly more fun to watch!I think McG should live on making movies, and I can't wait to see the next Charlie's Angels.

The comedy wasn't funny. The action wasn't exciting (think Matrix without the style, imagination or thrills). The plot didn't show.

I think Cameron Diaz is one of the most attractive actresses ever, certainly when playing Nathalie Cook.The only weak point is that the bad guy thinks Charlie killed his father, and only wants to get revenge/justice... so, I think the bad guy is not really such a bad guy :-(But never mind, for each Cameron Diaz fan certainly a must-see!!",Charlie's Angels

Next, there is some nicely choreographed Matrix action scenes.  And finally there is some humour.  But wait, this humour extends a little too far into our cheese category.  After a little while into the movie, I thought I was watching the evening sitcom.  The puns and the fake one-liners simply didn't work.  And finally there is the unbelievable cheese factor.

Well, Sam came through as usual, giving a performance full of subtlety and surprises, in a role that was written without much depth. I was also happy to see that all three Angels were able to give this movie plenty of humor and energy.I recommend it to anyone who is in a mood to see a fast-moving, funny movie. See it on the big screen.",Charlie's Angels

I can't remember when I had this much fun watching a movie.Even though this movie borrowed from The Matrix, True Lies, Mission Impossible, Mission Impossible 2 (it only borrowed the good parts from M:I 2) and number of others, so you would think you seen it all, but as it turns out, you haven't.There is great dialogue in many cases (quite humorous as well.)This movie was designed to please the audience and it accomplishes that quite well.Highly recommended (Unless the only reason you watch movies if for a Plot and Character development.)",Charlie's Angels

But the result is a movie with electric action sequences and the ability not to take itself too seriously. Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu burn up the screen, and they were both funnier than I expected.  Crispin Glover turns in a dead on performance that has to be seen to be truly enjoyed.  Light on story but heavy with laughs, it's this years must see guilty pleasure.",Charlie's Angels

454,bartlebe,Quite the most dreadful film I have ever seen.,1,28 August 2001,"A truly appalling piece of modern cinema.  Not unlike an MTV video but absent the clever visual tricks, relying instead on obvious cribs from the vastly superior 'The Matrix'.  Unremittingly awful dross.  Poor characterisation, laughable script.  The only notable performance is supplied by Bill Murray, who almost certainly ad-libbed a large percentage of his on-screen time in an attempt to save face.  If I ever come into contact with this lamentable rubbish again I will do something regrettable to the person responsible for subjecting me to it.",Charlie's Angels
455,Syllk,"Not to everyones taste, but it should more than appeal to the masses",10,11 September 2000,"I saw Charlie's Angels during an audience test session, and I must say that I was completely captivated from the opening sequence right through to the final scene.  An interesting blend of humour and action woven together with an excellent soundtrack certainly held my attention at its highest level. I never like to spoil movies by giving away the finer details, and I'm not going to start now...but anyone who has ever watched the original series will know the basic setup of the film, and will therefore appreciate that the storyline is never going to be the films strongest point.  Coupled with the fact that remaking the original series as a film would never work with todays audiences, the director has instead opted to emphasise the cheesiness of the original to comic proportions...and its effects hit the bullseye with great accuracy.  On the flip side of the coin, anyone watching this would be forgiven for thinking that John Woo had a hand in the action sequences, as they are certainly reminiscent of his style.  Over-the-top fight scenes with plenty of those 'IM 2' type stunts certainly made me check the credits again.  The strong performances of the equally strong cast are superb, with Bill Murray delivering his part to great comic effect.  The Angels (Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu) all play their parts beautifully, but I think Drew Barrymore deserves extra credit points for her performance. Crispin Glover also deserves a mention for his role as the villain...never has the villain looked so evil.  In summary, the film definitely stereotypes the original series, but it is so intentionally OTT that I have to admit, my friends and I have all said that we will go to see this movie again when it is released.  It won't (and will never) be to everyones taste, but in my opinion, if I had more thumbs, they too would be pointing enthusiastically skywards.",Charlie's Angels

459,kirk2n25,Goofiest movie ever.,8,4 November 2000,"This just might be the goofiest movie ever made. But that's what's so great about it. The classic 70's TV show is lampooned mercilessly where one scene is more incomprehensibly illogical than the last. It's amazing some critics have complained that there is too much attention on the girl's bodies and that the story is too unbelievable. Duuuhhh! Didn't they see the original series? That's the joke! There is plenty of non-stop action as well. The fight scenes look like ""The Matrix"" on speed. I can't think of a movie that was more fun than this. There are plenty of surprises and Bill Murray was a nice bonus. Admittedly the three main stars have enough sex appeal and charisma to hold the attention of any heterosexual male and make even the lamest joke seem funny. I for one thought it was hilarious. Just check your brain at the door.",Charlie's Angels

I had a great time seeing it and felt it was a good night out and worth the time and money to see it on the big screen. The audience reacted along with it, especially those who grew up with the original series. The sound track kept you going and made you envious of the screen (come on girls, didn't you want to jump in and fight along with them?). The humor, the style, the players all made it a great entertaining film. The action and stunts really kept you interested. If you want to see something to just have fun with, see this movie. If you are looking to tear it apart, then leave it alone. And everyone, stick around at the credits at the end. It is worth it.",Charlie's Angels
462,ShelleyD-3,"Wicked send-up, but then, surprise! Plot!",10,6 November 2000,"Charlie's Angels opens with this insanely implausible Mission-Impossible-esque mid-air dive from a plane scene, wherein LL Cool J is flying through the air with the mad ticking bomber, Lucy Liu defuses the bomber in mid-flight, and the three of them then make a 10 point landing in a speedboat driven by Cameron Diaz.  Then LL Cool J turns into Drew Barrymore.  And they laugh, and slap hands, and speedboat off into the horizon.  And that is what makes the first part of this movie so watchable.It's a great send-up of what are still totally impossible things for a human being to actually do but which we as an audience are expected to swallow whole in a spy movie.  And three girls in very high heels do them all. And laugh, and be bubbly.  It's hysterical!  There's even the inevitably super-creep villain's thug who collects bits of the Angels' hair.  And, also, Tim Curry, the quintessential superspy villain.  And it's a lot of martial arts and snappy one-liners and high-tech gizmos that are just plain eye candy, all the way up to about mid-point in the film.About that time, the film starts to really develop a nice little subplot that they've had cooking away ever since this movie started.  And you're taken aback, because by this time you're convinced that you're in for a silly wild ride with no plot.  And you're not!Because then comes the best part of Charlie's Angels: The Villain.  He turns out to be slick, not oily; stylish, not smarmy, and chilling, not Boris Badinoff.  And he's challenging!  The Angels really have to work to bring him down, and you can tell that because, in his biggest moment of triumph, the Angels suddenly become less than beautifully perfect.  It's just a fantastic call on the part of the director.And then there's more of the great villain, and more of the creepy guy, and more of the gizmos and one-liners and all the stuff that makes so much sense now that the movie's come this far.  It's a great way to spend two hours, and you'll thank yourself.  Trust me.",Charlie's Angels

In the first case, the fight scenes and allusions to other well known movies (Matrix, MI2, ...) are interesting. In the second case, the plot was boring. The three main characters are always doing something either illogical or surnatural in every scene (At least in Matrix, the movie is meant to be a sci-fi).

Any fan of the original should enjoy this one.Charlie's Angels was fun to watch, and didn't take itself too seriously. The dialog was full of innuendo, puns, and quotes (both from the series and elsewhere). The nods to previous movies, especially prison movies, kept me looking for the next reference, and added to the hilarity.

The loveably dysfunctional Drew Barrymore (Dylan), the ever wide mouthed Cameron Diaz (Natalie), and the lucy-est Lucy Liu (Alex), star as revamped 1970's private detectives in this wonderfully awful picture.
The film, while on no terms apologises for it's campy-ness, begins by laying the cards on the table as a dashikied L.L. Cool J. jumps out of an airplane after finding out the in flight movie was T.J. Hooker. This proves to be the acting highlight of the movie, because as we all know, it's a miracle L.L. Cool J. can even speak coherently at all.The plot line of the movie is, at worst, extremely nonsensical, and at best, an excuse for Cameron Diaz to shake her derriere in a pair of underpants that would make a five year old blush. Which brings us to the precise point I wish to make about this film, it is, without a doubt, the hottest film I have seen in years. The all around crook busting combined with the overt sexuality of the three major characters is more than enough to make this man want to sleep with each and every one of the angels, and potentially Bill Murray's character of Bosley simply for being close to them.When the lights came up in the theater and all was said and done, my first thoughts were ""Dear Lord, what an absolutely horrid film."" But by the time I had reached the rubbish bin eagerly awaiting my medium cherry coke, I had come around on the film forgetting the horrid acting, un-compelling plot and characters, and appalling plot line, and remembered the majesty that is Cameron in a bathing suit, Drew naked and falling out of a window, and Lucy baking muffins. On a scale of one to ten, I give it a 5.",Charlie's Angels

Cameron Diaz and Lucy Lui were also excellent in this movie! If you haven't seen it already, see it other wise you don't know what your missing out on",Charlie's Angels
474,not silent bob,I heard some people liked this. I wonder about those people.,1,29 August 2002,"Before I go in depth, let me begin by providing a short summary of this movie to those who are just glancing at this:AVOID THIS ""MOVIE"" LIKE THE PLAGUELets start with the main problems.  The director, McG, has up to this point only worked with music videos.  While skill at creating music videos can give a director an excellent sense of style and imagery, it doesn't give the director any skill at creating something meant to tell a story. Unfortunately for McG, neither does he have skill at telling a story, nor in imagery.  Which brings me to problem two. The general theme of the action and cinematography, in fact this movie, is a simple one.  Make it flashy, overdone and mind numbing.  And use techniques that made money for other people.  The Matrix made lots of money and it used wire effects in its combat scenes.  So they appear here, despite the fact that this movie's ""plot"" doesn't provide any reason for why the characters are able to perform these feats. The next problem is the plot.  It is full of holes and unlikely inconsistencies.  For example: The evil corporation has its mainframe under very tight security.  Security that is so tight that even when you provide the necessary fingerprints, retinal scans, and pressing of two buttons simultaneously you still cant get into it without triggering the alarms.  I wouldn't like to be the repairman for that computer.  Furthermore, although their mainframe is under such tight security, three people can walk into their building, without identification, and get the workers to riot.  It seems that they spent so much on the mainframe that they couldn't hire a security guard or two. This is all forgetting about the fact that the plot itself isn't very impressive.  You know that a movie is reaching when it includes a 5 minute sequence of one of the lead actresses dancing around with the camera zoomed in on her rear for no reason.In short- this is a movie that aimed to, and unfortunately did, capitalize on American pop culture.  Like most things intent on that goal, it wasn't original, entertaining, or intelligent, and by no means good or even mediocre.  1 out of 10",Charlie's Angels
475,SueC71,"Bad, real bad.",1,15 July 2002,I would have to say that the Scary Movie 2 copy was better than this.

Obviously Barrymore, Liu and Diaz cannot begin to compete with Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith, Kate Jackson or Cheryl Ladd and don't kid yourself by thinking they can.Now, the movie begins with an allusion to Angels in Chains, an episode from the 70's show (won't spoil what it is). I respect that.

The original series was charming and light hearted with genuine classy ladies that were hot, unlike these 3 bimbos.

Not actually being able to remember what my interests where back then, I did however by it on video when I got The Mummy 1 and 2. And I think I watched it once after that. But recently I've picked it up, after seeing the second one again, which I must say is a little corny, especially when the angel are about to fight Demi. (On the Desodo Case: we know.....LAME)The second has less realism, less plotting and less.....Crispin. The first Charlies Angels is a really good movie. I cant stop watching it. For people who are paying attention: no thats not the only reason. I like the fighting, I like the jokes, and come on: every bodies got to like The Chad! Any way, I don't think bagging any ones going to solve the problem, but I must say Bill Murray made a better Bosley. And they should have had more Crispin Glover to, for lack of a better word, make the movie creepier. But all-round Charlies Angels 1 is a good movie and any body with spare time and a love of leather and go-go boots should watch it. ""The Chad is stuck""",Charlie's Angels
