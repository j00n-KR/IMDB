0,TheLittleSongbird,"Beautifully filmed and acted, and a credible adaptation of a wonderful story",8,16 October 2011,"Jane Eyre is one of my favourite books, and I love period dramas, so naturally I wanted to see this film. I was very impressed overall. I remember the Dalton, Welles and Scott versions with fondness(didn't like the one directed by Zeffirelli very much), but didn't expect this film to be as good.In general, it isn't, and it isn't perfect. However it does have a number of strong things about it and is a credible adaptation. It is beautifully photographed, the locations are stunning likewise with the costumes and the atmosphere has quite a pleasing gloom to it.The music is well composed too, sparkling and poignant and rarely overbearing. The dialogue, apart from the odd part that could have done with more bite, is good and doesn't fall into the trap of being stilted, and the story is still the compelling and moving story I fell in love with with only the rather rushed and abrupt ending striking a false chord.Other good assets are strong direction and above all a great cast. As much as I do like Jamie Bell though, I wasn't entirely convinced by his performance, the look didn't matter so much, it was more to do with that Bell was not quite pious enough.However, Mia Wasikowska was much better than expected as Jane. I think she has grown as an actress, meaning while I didn't like her very much in Alice in Wonderland I loved her here. She's very beautiful and appropriately strong-willed.Michael Fassbender has such a strong screen presence, and although we don't see much of Rochester effort is done both on the writers and Fassbender's parts to make us care for him. Sally Hawkins is suitably icy, while Judi Dench is wonderful as she always is.All in all, beautifully rendered, directed and acted. And as an adaptation, while the ending could've been more in particular, it is more than credible. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",Jane Eyre
1,SnoopyStyle,vision from Fukunaga,8,23 May 2016,"Jane Eyre (Mia Wasikowska) runs away from Thornfield Hall and finds shelter with St John Rivers (Jamie Bell), and his sisters Diana (Holliday Grainger) and Mary (Tamzin Merchant). As an orphan child, she was mistreated by her aunt Mrs Reed (Sally Hawkins) and her son. She was sent to Lowood School for Girls ruled by the cruel Mr Brocklehurst and branded as a liar by Mrs Reed. She leaves the school to be a governess for French orphan Adèle Varens at Thornfield. Mrs Fairfax (Judi Dench) is the housekeeper. Edward Fairfax Rochester (Michael Fassbender) is the often absent owner.Cary Fukunaga brings a haunting cinematic brutal beauty to this Charlotte Brontë classic. The script has been stripped down to the needed scope. Mia Wasikowska has her sense of fragile determination. The acting is impeccable. This is less a costume romance and more a Gothic theater. It is really a painting of mood and deep feeling.",Jane Eyre
2,Prismark10,A Gothic romance,5,1 June 2015,"This film adaptation of Jane Eyre is told in flashbacks but looks like a stripped down version of the story.Mia Wasikowska looks plain and innocent enough as a governess for the daughter of a wealthy man. Michael Fassbender oozes broodiness as Rochester, the father of the child but he hides a deep secret and sadness.Rochester tentatively falls for Jane and asks her to marry him. Jane is confused and hesitant but agrees however during the wedding ceremony, Rochester's dark secret is revealed.I reckon the film could had done without the flashbacks and told in a more straightforward manner. The period setting is suitably sparse and bleak which is certainly in keeping with the underlying theme of the story.The film is not entirely successful, it never clicks until Fassbender arrives as the craggy, rude and abrupt Rochester. I did not feel it was cinematic enough. A BBC film that was better suited for the small screen.",Jane Eyre
3,claudio_carvalho,"Visually Stunning, Perfect Lead Actress but Missing Important Parts of the Romance",6,7 April 2012,"In 1829, the nine year-old orphan girl Jane Eyre is sent by her despicable aunt Mrs. Reed (Sally Hawkins) to Lowood Institution, a charity school directed by the cruel Mr. Henry Brocklehurst (Simon McBurney). Jane has a harsh childhood in the boarding school, where she loses her best friend Helen Burns (Freya Parks). After ten years, she is hired by Mrs. Fairfax (Judi Dench) as the governess of Adele Varens, who is the protégée of the master of Thornfield, Edward Rochester, and she leaves Lowood. Jane (Mia Wasikowska) moves to the manor and sooner she feels an unrequited love by her master. Despite their different social classes and ages, they become friends. Mr. Rochester breaks with his fiancée Blanche and proposes Jane. However, a gloomy secret from Mr. Rochester's past affects their lives and Jane Eyre does not marry her dearly beloved Mr. Rochester.Jane leaves the property and wanders, and is saved by the religious St. John Rivers (Jamie Bell) and his two sisters. St. John Rivers is a man of God and wants to marry Jane Eyre and travel with her to India. But Jane still loves Mr. Rochester and feels only fraternal love for St. John Rivers.""Jane Eyre"" is a visually stunning adaptation of the classic romance of Charlotte Brontë, with a perfect lead actress in the role of Jane Eyre but missing important parts of the story. The romance takes place in ""a harsh time of change in England, when money and position seemed all that mattered; charity was a cold and disagreeable word; and religion too often wore a mask of bigotry and cruelty."" However, this version ignores the period when Jane Eyre stays in the orphanage and the cruelties that she is submitted. This is the fourth version of ""Jane Eyre"" that I have watched and the 1943 version by Robert Stevenson is unbeatable, with the impressive atmosphere in black and white that fits to the Gothic fiction of the novel. Further, the powerful performance of Orson Welles is incomparable in the role of Edward Rochester.. The 1970 version is more faithful to the novel after the unsuccessful marriage of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester, with an adult discussion of the couple and more accurate fate of Jane. The 1996 version by Franco Zeffirelli is the weakest adaptation of the classic romance by Charlotte Brontë. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Jane Eyre""",Jane Eyre
4,kosmasp,Alice in Jayne Eyre-land,8,28 March 2012,"I don't really think that people will think of Alice in Wonderland, when they see the main actress. She is too good for anyone to even think about the other movie. While I haven't read or seen a prior work of art on the subject matter, I really liked the movie. The performances are superb (even if as I understand Michael Fassbenders character was much older and uglier in the book or so I've been told) and the script does work in the environment it places itself.But it's about the subtle performances and about things that are not being said out loud. If you like those things, then you will like the movie too. Don't expect it to be grandiose or spectacular, but try to embrace the movie as it is, if you can.",Jane Eyre
5,rmax304823,Danker Than Some.,7,25 February 2013,"You can't help but compare this to MGM's ""Jane Eyre"" which appeared in the early 1940s.Hollywood's version was filmed in the California sunshine. The sets -- even those designed to be dismal -- are built by the studio and are inviting in their own fustian way. Peggy Ann Garner, as young Jane, is plain and appealing. As the grown-up Jane, Joan Fontaine was lovely and shivered with fright. Best of all was Orson Welles as the mysterious, mercurial, monumental Rochester.As in this version, Rochester falls off his horse, if I remember correctly, but Welles, with his enormous resonant baritone, is no Michael Fassbender. Welles is a real MAN and can take care of himself, whereas Fassbender asks for Jane's help to get back to his horse. The original has a deep flaw, however. The delicious young Elizabeth Taylor shuffles off this mortal coil near the beginning. A damned shame, if you ask me.Mia Wasikowska is a rather stoic Jane. And the settings are natural, apparently including the interiors. The locations were scattered all over England and seem to have been shot in constant murk, as if it were all taking place on the Pribilof Islands. I haven't read the novel but I'd guess that this modern version sticks more closely to the original narrative. When those young girls get whipped, they really get whipped. Nobody in Hollywood's version got whipped. The God-fearing sons of America might have been offended, which would have affected the box office returns and, ultimately, the temperament of Louis B. Mayor.The 1940s version was a gripping fantasy, what with Welles booting about the mansion and hiding his secrets. This one is more adult and it's ""bigger"" in the sense that period detail is probably more accurate, if only because it's more noticeable.I wonder if Charlotte Bronte's novel was the beginning of this ""mysterious and masterful stranger"" theme. You know, innocent girl attracted to a taciturn man who is hiding something? It's a cliché by now. ""Rebecca"" was hardly more than ""Jane Eyre"" redux. And there are elements of it to be found even in stories as thematically removed from 19th-century England as a Western like ""Shane."" These handsome, enigmatic, powerful men -- of which I happen to be one -- are to women what rogue horses are. A kind of challenge. Can I tame this animal and keep him at home and hearth?The 1940s version was well done, in fact, but in a way that's very different from this one. Both are surprisingly good. Either could easily have been turned into a mess of cinnamon-flavored porridge.",Jane Eyre
6,CinemaSerf,"Solid, well made version of a great piece of English literature.",7,17 August 2020,"Charlotte Brontë could hardly have been described a prolific author (she was only 39 when she died), but in ""Jane Eyre"" she certainly proved that less can certainly be more. It's a cleverly complex story of a young girl who finds herself in the harshest of early Victorian schools where religion and brutality are the order of the day. As with the author, herself - she turns to teaching and as an adult, is posted to a rural parish to assist ""St. John Rivers"" (Jamie Bell) who finds her a position as a governess at Thornfield Hall - home of the rather cold ""Rochester"" (Michael Fassbender). Mia Wasikowska plays the title role in an determinedly engaging manner - she displays the feistiness of the heroine but also reveals, slowly, the kind and considerate nature that one might expect to have long since left her following her rather cruel upbringing. As the relationship starts to develop, Cary Fukunaga offers, I think, quite an authentic interpretation of the book - and with good additional contributions from Bell, briefly from Simon McBurney as the positively evil ""Mr. Brocklehurst"" and, of course, from Dame Judi Dench as the warm hearted housekeeper ""Mrs. Fairfax"" he build this story of secrecy, love and affection well. It hasn't the grittiness or vibrancy of the Welles/Fontaine version from 1943 - the colour largely sees to that - but it is still amongst the best adaptations to hit the screen - large or small.",Jane Eyre
7,grantss,Disappointing,5,3 November 2015,"Disappointing. I haven't read the book, so had no prior knowledge of the plot, and can't comment on how faithful the movie is to the book. However, for all its potential, the movie ends up feeling quite listless, especially in the latter half. It started well - Jane's background and upbringing was heart- wrenching, giving the movie an edge and the feeling that this was to be a rising-above-one's-background sort of story. However, from a point it stops being a human drama, and is just a romantic drama, dully told. It drifts and when the end comes, it is a relief.Cinematography and costumes are great.Performances are OK. Mia Wasikowska's performance is solid, though her accent seems to vary from scene to scene. Michael Fassbender is intense, maybe too much so. Found him a bit irritating.Surely there are better adaptations out there.",Jane Eyre
8,Boba_Fett1138,Definitely a good genre movie.,7,14 February 2012,"Now, I'll immediately admit that these sort of costume dramas are most certainly not my cup of tea. But I'll try to look past that and take the movie for what it is and judge it for its quality.And really, this is not a movie you could be very negative about. It's simply too well made for that, with great visuals but some even better acting in it.I never was too big on Mia Wasikowska as an actress but with this movie she convinced me of her abilities. I also really liked Michael Fassbender in his role and it by now is an almost absolute certainty he will get an Oscar, somewhere in the next 5 years. Someone who also really pleasantly surprised me was Jamie Bell. Who would had known that he was also capable of playing these more heavy and demanding sort of roles.And like most costume dramas, it's relying heavily on its actors and their performance. And luckily there is very little wrong with the acting in this movie, especially also when Dame Judi Dench starts to show up in it. But its also definitely true that they are being helped by its fine written dialog, that gives the movie most of its pace. It's really never becoming a boring or overlong movie to watch, unlike many of the other genre examples.But I still had some minor problems with this movie. Well, not problems really but more things that came across to me as not quite good or effective enough at times. The drama, the tension, the mystery, the romance. It all really could had been done a tad bit better to get me a bit more involved with it all. The story itself is solid and interesting enough. Perhaps it sound weird but it all reminded me of an '40's Hitchcock movie, with its atmosphere, characters and secrets, that were playing a key role in the movie its story.It's not my sort of thing but if the Jane Austen type of movies are your thing, you'll definitely be able to appreciate and enjoy this movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Jane Eyre
9,evanston_dad,Very Good Version of a Much-Told Story,8,11 March 2012,"You would be forgiven for wondering if the world really needed yet one more version of Charlotte Bronte's Gothic pot boiler, but don't let that reluctance keep you from seeing this one, as it's a pretty darn good movie.Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender do exceptional work as Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, and the filmmakers embrace the ghost story elements of Bronte's creepy-big-manor-house story. Solid production design and Oscar-nominated costumes will satisfy lovers of period detail, and an obvious love of the source material makes the story feel fresh.Judi Dench and Jamie Bell (aka Billy Elliott) round out the cast.Grade: A-",Jane Eyre
10,ferguson-6,"Pleasure, Not Happiness",8,20 March 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. For a film to rate highly with me, mass appeal is not necessary. The requirements are an interesting story that is well cast, well acted and well directed. Though it is often required reading in high school, the novel by Charlotte Bronte is a timeless classic and among the most popular of all time. The key roles in this latest film version are played well by Dame Judi Dench (Mrs. Fairfax), Michael Fassbender (Rochester) and Mia Wasikowska (Jane). Cary Fukunaga directs. He was also responsible for the powerful 2009 film Sin Nombre (highly recommended).There have been numerous film and TV versions of this classic over the years, with the 1943 version being the most famous. Orson Welles starred as Rochester and Joan Fontaine was Jane. While that version still works, this year's model is the first that I believe surpasses that one in quality. The two keys are the performance of Mia Wasikowska and the direction of Mr. Fukunaga.The film surprises a bit with it's flashback approach, but it works well in linking the older Jane with her early struggles. This version really rests heavy on Wasikowska's shoulders and she does not disappoint. You will recognize her from her recent turns in Alice in Wonderland, and The Kids Are All Right. She quickly jumps to the head of the Jane Eyre class. Very impressive.Fukunaga's direction relies on art direction and spectacular lighting. He draws in the viewer to this dark and mysterious world where much goes unstated, yet so much is communicated. The good girl/bad boy battle is always fun and moreso when the good girl is a remarkably independent and brassy girl, while the bad boy is very dark and dangerous. Of course, this is Hollywood so the novel's unattractive Rochester is played by the strapping Fassbender (Inglourious Basterds).What always attracted me to this story was the strength and perseverance of Jane herself. To find a girl with such fortitude and moral stamina despite her upbringing and longings means the central character is both fascinating and easy to pull for. She is what we would wish for our own daughters ... self confident, full of character and observant of what is fair and just.If you aren't the literary type, don't expect to enjoy this film. Watching it is truly like the visualization that occurs when reading a top novel. I was completely drawn into life at Thornfield Hall and the life of Jane Eyre.",Jane Eyre
11,HotToastyRag,Too modern a version,3,15 February 2021,"Ah, the 2011 version of Jane Eyre - also known as the version that ruins the ending by showing it first. Just as the 2000 tv movie of The Great Gatsby shows the ending first, this one shows Jane running away from Thornfield Hall. Why would you start a movie that way, unless your sole goal is to bank on audience's short attention spans and insult the flow of the author's original intent?The beginning is just the beginning of the flaws with this version. Mia Wasikowska can sometimes give a brilliant performance, but not when playing the famed Bronte governess. I didn't believe she felt intensely lonely, something needed in Jane Eyre's character to explain why she treasures Rochester's friendship. She should also feel surprised that her wealthy employer treats his governess as an equal, but Mia merely acts entitled to participate in such intelligent conversation. Michael Fassbender is sufficiently brooding, but in this adaptation he isn't given very much to do. The focus is on the title character, and Mia doesn't really fill her shoes.I loved seeing Judi Dench as Miss Fairfax, though. She's so sweet and friendly, and you can tell her heart really goes out to the young governess. Just as Judi Dench isn't enough to save the 2005 version of Pride & Prejudice, she isn't enough to save this 2011 version of Jane Eyre. Do Charlotte Bronte a favor and stick with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens.",Jane Eyre
12,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Jane Eyre,8,3 July 2011,"There are countless of stage, film and television adaptations of Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre, that you may wonder if the world needs yet another version, if not to update and reintroduce it to another generation who have yet to read the source material, and through a different medium be intrigued enough to want to find out more, especially on subplots not covered. Directed by Cary Fukunaga, you'd come to expect a certain aesthetic quality associated with a period film, and this one doesn't disappoint.Essentially telling the story of the titular character from childhood until her late teens, we go through her miserable time at her aunt's at Gateshead, and fast track through her strict education at Lowood School, essentially told in quick flashbacks that glossed over plenty of details and being spared a series of wrong doings dished out toward this outspoken little girl, whom by the time she's played by Mia Wasikowska, we're introduced to a very mannered, cultured young woman where the bulk of the narrative takes place during her stint as a governess at Thornfield Hall for the ward of Edward Fairfax Rochester (Michael Fassbender). But that doesn't mean that the girl had essentially changed, but what I felt had become a little smarter in conforming to what society expects on the outside, while harbouring plenty of dreams and desires of an independent spirit on the inside, waiting for opportunities to present themselves before springing free. The crux of it of course comes from a persistent wooing by the lord of the house as the classic Byronic hero is taken in by what would be a whiff of fresh air compared to the other ladies whom he frequently comes into contact with, where in Jane Eyre is a combative spirit, an intellectual equal able to hold her own in conversation and wit. Therein lies a problem, given societal norms of the time what with social standing, and impropriety coming from an employer-employee relationship, which Mrs Fairfax (Judi Dench) never fails to remind.Starring Mia Wasikowska who shot to prominence here in Tim Burton's adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, she played the character of Jane in truly plain Jane fashion and constantly decked in frumpy coloured clothes to highlight her dedication and quiet strength, coupled with her high morals in refusing to do what's not right nor succumbing to the affairs of the heart, despite what I would believe are concerns that are likely glossed over in today's context. And she owns the role of the passionate and outspoken young woman that you'll likely find yourself rooting for her whenever adversary gets in her way. Fassbender continues to charm his way on screen as the roguish looking Rochester whose mood swings to and fro at the drop of a hat, sending conflicting signals and all the while harbouring something quite sinister in the background that unravels itself like a good mystery. It'll do you some good to keep an eye on Fassbender's career from this point on.The beauty of the English language comes to play here, while we do not speak like that anymore, it brings out a certain romanticism throughout the entire film. With strange and mysterious incidents peppering Jane Eyre's governess stint that will hold your attention span, if you're gearing for an English period romantic drama, then Jane Eyre will be your choice before it gets forced out by the summer blockbusters, even if the narrative has to be watered down from its novel, focusing its attention solely on the key components of the character's life. Recommended, and I really enjoyed the haunting soundtrack.",Jane Eyre
13,JamesHitchcock,"A worthy ""Jane Eyre"" for our times",8,27 September 2011,"""Jane Eyre"" has been filmed a number of times; the two previous versions I have seen are the 1943 film starring with Joan Fontaine and the 1996 Zeffirelli version with Charlotte Gainsbourg, but I will not attempt a comparison between Cary Fukunaga's film and its two predecessors, as it is a long time since I last saw either of them. Nor will I set out the plot in any detail as most people will be familiar with it either from having read the book or, if they have not done so, from having seen one or more of the many television and cinema adaptations.This version sticks fairly closely to the plot of Charlotte Brontë's novel, although its structure is different. Unlike her sister Emily, whose ""Wuthering Heights"" has a peculiarly labyrinthine structure, Charlotte was not a great stylistic innovator and told her story as a straightforward first-person linear narrative. The film, however, starts at a particularly dramatic juncture- Jane's arrival at the home of St. John Rivers following her flight from Thornfield Hall- and tells the earlier part of her story in a series of flashbacks. Fukunaga and the scriptwriter Moira Buffini obviously felt that this was a more dramatic way of telling the story in the cinema.Jamie Bell portrays Rivers as being perhaps rather warmer and more passionate than the equivalent character in the novel, but with that possible exception the characters are all very much as Brontë conceived them. I was not too impressed by Mia Wasikowska in the last film in which I saw her, Tim Burton's rather eccentric interpretation of ""Alice in Wonderland"", but here she is excellent as Jane. Some have complained that she is lacking in charisma, but this criticism misses the point that Jane Eyre is not a charismatic heroine. One of the novel's themes is the contrast between appearance and reality, and Jane initially appears plain, dull and dowdy. Certainly, that is how she initially appears to Rochester, and it is only gradually that he comes to appreciate her good qualities- her steadfastness, courage, her strong sense of duty and morality and her capacity for love, all of which are brought out in Wasikowska's portrayal. If charisma were all that mattered, Rochester would have married the beautiful but superficial Blanche Ingram. Michael Fassbender is appropriately moody and Byronic as Rochester, but also brings out the tragedy of his past. The other actor who deserves to be singled out is Judi Dench as the kindly housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax.While the 1943 film tried to recreate the Yorkshire Moors in a Hollywood studio, this one was largely filmed at various locations in Britain, including the mediaeval Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, one of Britain's oldest and most austere stately homes, which stood in for Thornhill (as it did in Zeffirelli's film). The use of authentic locations enables Fukunaga to capture the Gothic atmosphere of the novel, which is an important part of its appeal.The task of turning a work of classic literature, especially one as popular as ""Jane Eyre"", into a movie is not always an easy one. Some recent examples, such as Patricia Rozema's version of Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park"", have tried too hard to be ""relevant"" to modern times and have departed too far from the original plot. Others have been beautiful but lifeless. Fukunaga and Buffini, however, have avoided both these traps, and are to be congratulated on producing a worthy ""Jane Eyre"" for our times. 8/10",Jane Eyre
14,lasttimeisaw,Jane Eyre,8,22 September 2011,"I always hold a favorable perspective towards remakes in view of that top-notch scripts are invaluable in Hollywood at this moment in time, especially from classic literature canons. My personal background is that I have neither read Charlotte Brontë's book nor watched any previous film/TV adaptations, so for me it is a sheer new film to adventure into. This version of JANE EYRE has a gallant ambition with its Gothic palette and a refreshing cast, from American director Cary Fukunaga, whose 2009 debut SIN NOMBRE is his career's speed- up propeller. It all starts with the gloomy flashbacks which prefigures a troubled and hear- rending journey ahead (for viewers of course), which constantly reminds me of UK female auteur Andrea Arnold's FISH FANK (Mr. Fassbender also stars), coincidently Andrea's latest film is a new version of WUTHERING HEIGHTS (from Emily Brontë, Charlotte's younger sister), which overtly is a more controversial task. The haunting cinematography and the shoulder-held camera relentlessly fabricate a brittle and bleak milieu and I am fascinated by the thrilling surroundings and tenderness excavated in-between the melodramatic sincerity and gut- wrenching mental sojourn staying within the film's main characters. The cast is immaculate, a young Gwyneth Paltrow-look Mia Wasikowska undertakes the overloading leading Jane with sympathetic nuances, and the awareness of female Independence has been instigated with credibility which is always a triumph to witness on screen. Fassbender, who may be too flawless to act as a dishonest Rochester, is fierce and sultry at the same moment using his unique charisma. Judi Dench, Sally Hawkins and even Jamie Bell's supporting roles are bitty but unflinchingly solid. The latter part is quite hasty in my opinion, perhaps on account of the running time (I suggest a 150-minutes length could be appropriate because it's better to give some room for the downplayed Mason family). Overall the film is not plucky enough though the material is affluent, a woeful top-heavy ending foils itself becoming a perfectly justifiable masterpiece.",Jane Eyre
15,Red-125,In medias res,9,4 October 2020,"This movie version of Charlotte Brontë's novel Jane Eyre (2011) was directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga.The film stars Mia Wasikowska as Jane, and Michael Fassbender as Rochester. Both are excellent. Sally Hawkins is also excellent as Mrs. Reed, Jane's evil aunt. No one could play the housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, better than Dame Judi Dench.Director Fukunaga has decided to begin the movie in medias res. The film starts with Jane arriving cold, wet, and near death at the home of the Rivers family. (Jamie Bell portrays St John Rivers--pronounced ""Sinjin."") Then Fukunaga uses flashback and nonlinear narrative to tell the complete story.Jane Eyre is too rich a novel to fit well into a two-hour movie. I hope that someone like the BBC does a Jane Eyre mini-series. Within a two-hour limit, directors have to choose what they will emphasize. Jane's terrible life at her aunt's home and at her horrible school are disposed of quickly. The episode with Rivers carries much more weight than usual.Of course, the central theme--Jane and Rochester--is the most important, and is treated as such. The story of Jane and Rochester will always be a great example of Gothic fiction, and it certainly is that in this adaptation.I reluctantly admit that I didn't know the work of Mia Wasikowska or Michael Fassbender. Both are important actors, but I'd never seen either on screen. They are extremely talented, and the onscreen chemistry was apparent.This movie worked well on the small screen. It has a solid IMDb rating of 7.3. I thought it was better than that, and rated it 9.P.S. The Focus Features DVD came with two interesting specials about the musical score of the movie and the lighting of the film. You might want to consider watching both specials before you see the movie. I was certainly much more conscious of the music and lighting after watching the short films.",Jane Eyre
16,Rectangular_businessman,Decent version of a history that has been done to death,8,5 May 2012,"Despite the fact the story of Jane Eyre have been adapted many, many times before in different formats(Like Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol""), this film still manages to have some remarkable qualities, being also faithful (Well, for most part) of the original book in which it was inspired.The direction is pretty good, with some visually impressive scenes (In fact, the visual style somewhat reminded me other films such as ""Never Let me Go"" or ""The New World"" from Terrence Malick, except that unlike those two films, this movie is not a complete snore-fest) and very good performances, which capture the best elements of their characters. The soundtrack for this film (Composed by Dario Marianelli) is flawless , being the best part of this movie (Besides of the good performances and great production values) capturing the mood of the story and giving the film a magnificent atmosphere of melancholy and romance.As an adaptation, it's a pretty good one. Even if it isn't completely faithful to the book, it is way more respectful of the source material than other versions (Such as the one done by Franco Zeffirelli) Overall, this movie does a pretty decent work adapting the novel written by Charlotte Bronte, having enough good qualities to make it interesting for me, despite the fact that I knew the story so well that I thought it could never impress me. But this adaptation, somehow, managed to impress me, at least for most part.",Jane Eyre
17,howard.schumann,A captivating version,8,1 May 2011,"It is not uncommon to hear the phrase ""plain Jane"" referring to someone without striking good looks, but few are aware that the Jane in the phrase refers to Jane Eyre, the homely orphan girl in Charlotte Bronte's famous 1847 novel of the same name. In the novel, Jane survives a tormented childhood, learning to survive the indignities of a hateful aunt (Sally Hawkins) and a cruel charity school to become a compassionate adult who learns to believe in herself as a woman and gain her place in the world. Since I am probably one of the few people on the planet who has not read the novel or seen any of the 27 filmed versions, I could see Cary Fukanaga's (Sin Nombré) filmed version of Jane Eyre without any preconceptions, and it is a good one. The film opens with Jane (Mia Wasikowska) by herself in tears in an empty field in the middle of a fierce storm, her heart broken by the dishonesty of someone she held dear. From the next scene in which she finds a sanctuary in the home of Christian missionary St. John Rivers (Jamie Bell) with two sisters (Holliday Grainger and Tamzin Merchant), Fukunaga flashes back to Jane's beginnings and how she reached that point in time. At ten-years of age, Jane (Amelia Clarkson) has much to overcome. Being called a liar by her aunt, her self-confidence is further damaged by the physical punishment she has to endure at a charity school run by fundamentalists. Her only companion is Helen (Freva Parks), a fragile child who stands up to the cruelty around her, but who dies of consumption, leaving Jane alone and friendless. In her teens, Jane becomes the governess of Adele (Romy Settbon Moore) at the Thornfield estate owned by Edward Rochester (Michael Fassbender) and his housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax (Judi Dench). Set in the remote moors of England's Yorkshire district, a country captured in all its stark moodiness by cinematographer Adriano Goldman, Fukanaga creates a feeling of dark unease in the huge mansion with its strange rattles and sounds, windows with bars, and wind eerily blowing through the chimney. Welcomed by Mrs. Fairfax, Jane's initial fears are partially allayed by the housekeeper's warmth, but her life becomes more difficult when she encounters Rochester on the country road in which she was walking, disheveled after falling from his horse. Though she is at first afraid of him because of his gruff manner, she is willing to reach out to him and look past the restrictions of their life stations, he a nobleman and she a commoner. Through fireside talks that are often intimate and witty, her awakening sexual feelings and his longing for companionship make them increasingly aware of their mutual needs. Slowly, their connection begins to emerge, even though the social differences between them are still an ever-present barrier. Jane, however, is able to overcome Rochester's often brooding and sullen nature to develop enough self-confidence to talk with him on a level of equality. . After Rochester reveals a powerful secret that he has been withholding, Jane's world is shaken and the film shifts to the present, repeating the opening scene of a distraught young woman on the moor who negotiates a storm to find a home with the devout clergyman Rivers. The missionary wants more than a brother and sister relationship, however, and Jane is forced to make a difficult choice about the kind of life she wants to live. Though I had nothing to compare it with, I found Fukanaga's version of the romantic story of loss and redemption to be captivating, and the lead actors to be very convincing. I did feel something missing, however. Though Wasikowska captures the spirit of a spunky young woman, embodying the conflicting emotions of a young girl emerging into womanhood, I did not experience the inner sadness or depth that might have come from someone so totally rejected in her childhood and adolescence. Nevertheless, the film resonates with its powerful depiction of free will and class distinctions, delivering an important message about transcending limitations and being willing to find one's own way in life.",Jane Eyre
18,l_rawjalaurence,Middle-of-the-Road Bronte Adaptation,6,14 July 2013,"Charlotte Bronte's novel has been adapted so many times for the cinema that it becomes difficult to distinguish between various versions. Orson Welles' Mr. Rochester sticks in the mind, not so much for its closeness to what Bronte might have imagined, but for its sheer bravura. Charlotte Gainsbourg's Jane Eyre was a waif with a surprising strength of character. This version has a winsome performance by Mia Wasikowska as the eponymous heroine; an innocent trying to make her way in a world apparently peopled by sadists and rapacious men. Michael Fassbender turns in a one-note characterization of Rochester; all smoldering eyes and winsome expressions, he wheedles his way into Jane's heart to such an extent that she cannot forget him. The ending is a bit of a cop-out, as Jane reunites with the (now-blind) Rochester in a gesture of reconciliation, without there being any justification for such a move. Rochester in the main behaves despicably, as does Jamie Bell as Rivers. The film contains the usual visual clichés associated with costume drama - old houses, period costumes and slow-moving shots of the landscape in vivid autumn colors. It's nice to look at, but hardly memorable.",Jane Eyre
19,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Visually masterful and authentic performances, a nice change for period drama",7,12 March 2011,"Charlotte Brontë's seminal literary work ""Jane Eyre"" has been adapted countless times and prepared in a myriad of ways from the 1943 Joan Fontaine/Orson Welles version that was whittled to an hour and a half to the 1983 BBC mini-series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton that spans five-plus hours. That certainly begs the question of why anyone, from writer Moira Buffini to director Cary Fukunaga to Dame Judi Dench, would feel inspired to recreate this coming-of-age story about love and accepting its blemishes.Fukunaga's (""Sin Nombre"") take doesn't exactly provide an amazing revelation or epiphanic justification for bringing ""Jane Eyre"" back to life, but it does prove that no classic can be so overdone that it becomes untouchable; even the most tried and dated of love stories can find new life. Fukanaga has given ""Jane Eyre"" a photorealistic makeover devoid of frills and fiercely au naturel, but no less gripping than the story's ""livelier"" retellings.Fictional period dramas often feel overtly pristine and glazed over to the point of fairytale, but in watching this film, you get the sense that this is quite possibly how the story would have looked and felt if it had been true. All the way down to accents, this rendition has clearly labored over historical authenticity and it shows in the finished product.Mia Wasikowska (""The Kids Are All Right"") continues to choose spot-on independent films despite leading the billion-dollar ""Alice in Wonderland"" of 2010 and it continues to pay off. She's clearly adept at embodying literary characters, or at least at recreating them within herself rather than worrying about trying to become the way the majority perceives them. Her modest looks suit Jane perfectly and she can play both the fragile girl who has been so often wronged by those who were supposed to care for her and the somewhat self-assured young woman who so plainly understands right from wrong.Buffini (""Tamara Drewe"") tells ""Jane Eyre"" in an un-narrated flashback. The film opens with Jane dashing away from the spectre of the Thornfield estate and stumbling through the beautifully captured but cold and desolate English countryside in a state of total anguish. She arrives at the Rivers' place where they enquire as to her identity. As the voice of Mr. Rochester (Michael Fassbender) beckons her, she cannot block out the memories of her journey. The film then catches up to that point in real time and continues on to the end.Other than a terrific performance from Amelia Clarkson as young Jane, the early chapters involving Lowood School seem to be of less significance in this version other than the very clear point to establish Mr. Brocklehurst as an insensitive headmaster and clearly spell out Jane's early traumas that have affected her perspective. The love story between Jane and Mr. Rochester and the way it affects Jane takes supreme precedence in this film and with a two- hour run time, rightfully so. Nevertheless, the short beginnings prevent the film from showing the whole scope of Jane's troubled life.Fassbender and Wasikowska work terrifically and manage to communicate the class and age discrepancy that made ""Jane Eyre"" a juicy read back in the 19th Century. Fassbender does seem to let Rochester's guard down quicker than expected, but I enjoyed his choice to be less standoffish and more brooding; he determines his secret to be more a responsibility of an unfortunate nature than a loathsome burden. His love for Jane then feels more sincere.An actress as magnetizing as Judi Dench choosing to play the caretaker Mrs. Fairfax sums up the humble attitude of this ""Jane Eyre."" She uses her gravitas to the effect of being the film's lone comic relief and complements the scenes rather than stealing them from Wasikowska, who is 55 years her junior.The film itself aims for subtlety and chooses not to amp up the shock value of the story's most pivotal scenes. There's some manufactured suspense, but it's mostly natural. It ends up being the most commendable aspect of Fukunaga's vision, but maybe the most hampering as well. He creates exceptional tone and mood with the help of his wonderful cast and this seizes our interest, but his ""Jane"" never takes a chance with any emotional punches. A superbly crafted film, just not a resonant one.~Steven C",Jane Eyre
20,BeneCumb,Far-above-average historical drama,7,8 January 2014,"I am sure I read the novel Jane Eyre at school - as it was included into the mandatory reading list - but I had only very brief memories, thus I could watch the film with its twists and turns. The use of flashbacks is logical, but sometimes abstruse, as young Jane and Adele were performed by resembling children, and some scenes were too lengthy, resulting with the total length of almost 2 hours. The real gem is the cast, particularly Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre, Michael Fassbender as Edward Fairfax Rochester, Jamie Bell as St. John Rivers, Judi Dench as Mrs. Fairfax; these performers are quality signs to be followed and enjoyed everywhere. Moreover, the Brits are able to create authentic environment for the films based on their novels, including language/pronunciation, landscape, pace of events.Thus, a good film, but still not at the level of e.g. Howard's End or The Remains of the Day - apparently due to ""weaker"" basis, not performances.",Jane Eyre
21,DarkVulcan29,A very well made period piece.,10,11 April 2011,"Jane(Alice In Wonderlands, Mia Wasikowska) is running away from her the place she was calling home, and is caught in the rain, and is taking in by a young minister(Jamie King) and his sisters. And quickly it embarks in flashbacks of Janes troubled child, to her becoming governess, her relationship with Mr. Rochester(Michael Fassbender), and the terrible secret that caused her runaway.One of I consider to be the best film of 2011, It's beautifully well shot, and it never gets boring, it's also very well paced. And the performances do not disappoint either. Mia Wasikowska gives an Oscar worthy performance as Jane. Michael Fassbender is also good, he and Wasikowska have great chemistry. Jamie Bell is also good too, and let's forget Judi Dench also.",Jane Eyre
22,PWNYCNY,Jane Eyre is great.,10,25 March 2011,"This movie is exquisite. It is an example of how a dramatic movie should be made. Far from being corny or contrived, this movie is about integrity, courage, loyalty, and friendship. The movie is beautifully filmed and conveys the moodiness and foreboding associated with the story. The acting is great by all members of the cast. This movie tells a story and tells it well. It provides a glimpse of nineteenth century English society and how people looked and acted at that time. Yet the movie is more than a period piece; its themes are timeless. At no time does the story drag. Jane Eyre is heroic. She is the epitome of human goodness, not the kind that's candy-coated but the kind that is genuine. She transcends a harsh childhood to become a source of great strength for everyone around her. Unlike most Hollywood movies today, Jane Eyre is story-driven, and the story is strong. This movie is well worth watching and the title character is a role model for adolescents or young adults of all ages to emulate.",Jane Eyre
23,barnabyrudge,"Umpteenth version of a literary classic - generally well-made, with just about enough fresh angles to justify its existence.",6,1 November 2011,"I'm always a little reluctant to see new adaptations of old literary favourites. There's something redundant about telling the same story again and again and again. There are at least 20 versions of 'Jane Eyre' if you count old silent editions, foreign language versions and TV mini-series. And at least 5 versions have played as major theatrical releases over the decades. Upon entering the cinema to watch this latest re-run, I wondered if there would be anything new on offer or if it would be a long and tedious regurgitation of the previous adaptations. It's good to be able to report that this is a pretty good 'Jane Eyre' – handsomely shot, well-acted, a little darker than most of its predecessors. There are still plenty of moments that evoke déjà vu, but generally I think the makers have just about justified the need for another version of the story.Feisty Jane Eyre is sent away by her cruel aunt to Lowood School, where she is treated very badly by the staff. As she matures into adulthood, Jane (Mia Wasikowska) becomes a righteous, strong-willed woman, though she still retains a certain timidity and humbleness too. She leaves Lowood and gets a job as a governess at Thornfield Hall, teaching a young foreign girl. The master of the house, Mr Rochester (Michael Fassbender), is quickly struck by Jane's character. He finds her a woman of paradoxes – intelligent yet humble, plain yet desirable, resilient yet insecure. Over time, Jane overcomes Rochester's coldness and arrogance and learns more of the man within. They fall in love and eventually plan to marry, but a dark secret from Rochester's past hangs over them and threatens to destroy everything. When the secret comes out, Jane runs away from Thornfield and is rescued by devout Christian, Mr. St. John (Jamie Bell). But still she yearns for Rochester and the promise of love that has been cruelly snatched away from her...Despite some of the negative criticism Wasikowska has received in the title role, I think she does a good job. She acts with her face, particularly her eyes – conveying the inner torment between what she wants and what she can have rather well. Fassbender is suitably brooding and cruel as Rochester, though he does seem to lack something to make the character completely work. The relationship between the two is probably the weakest aspect of the film – it's never particularly believable, with no clear reason for Rochester to be so smitten by Jane, and no clear reason why Jane would fall for one so secretive and mean. Technically the film is well done throughout – lots of impressive sets, costumes, atmospheric lighting, evocative photography and so on. There is a little more emphasis on the darker tone of the story than we've seen in previous versions, which makes it worthwhile for those who have already seen several of the previous ones. In summary, this 'Jane Eyre' is a perfectly acceptable addition to the long, long list of adaptations of this classic story.",Jane Eyre
24,jadepietro,Poor Plain Jane,7,25 April 2011,"( Recommended ) On the outset, let me say, that like the film's heroine, I had great trepidation. Poor Jane will go from one dilemma to another. Alas, poor me will go from one adaptations to another. This time my fear focused on the latest umpteenth remake of Charlotte Bronte's classic tale, Jane Eyre. I was torn with my own pangs of angst and yearning too. Should I see yet again another version of this Gothic romantic melodrama? ( While researching this question, I discovered that there have been at least 8 teleplays, 6 movies, and numerous adaptations and related works, including SCTV parody, Jane Eyrehead, which, by the way, I would unconditionally love to see.) Or, should I miss Cary Fukunaga's vision of this work? ( Fukunga's first film, Sin Nombre (2009), was such an accomplished piece of filmmaking from a rare new talent. I was simply blown away from his directorial debut.)￼ So, here I sat in the theater, viewing this familiar story of the young moral governess of Thornfield House and her journey to find fulfillment and love with her wealthy employer, the brooding and mysterious Mr. Rochester, as this film predictably followed the familiar plot mechanism and framework of its original source, with a bit of flashback to perk up this version. I won't belabor this well known plot, except to say that Fukunaga breathes a new life into this old chestnut and does take some liberties in his modernization of this classic tale. In this version, Mia Wasikowska stars as the not so plain Jane and Michael Fassbender as her dubious conquest. Both are too attractive for their roles, but how can one swoon without real beauty to behold?Ms. Wasikowska handles her role quite efficiently, as the grievous victim of class struggle. She displays the earnestness and determination of our heroine with real conviction. But Mr. Fassender has some difficulty with his characterization, especially in the early courtship scenes. He comes off as a lovesick schoolboy, a mere flirt of a man. As the character becomes more intense and dark, Fassender cuts a dashing and compelling figure that is necessary for the plot contrivances. Yet, a real chemistry between the two actors seemed lacking to me.Where Fukunaga's film makes its fatal mistake with its solid interpretation of the novel is by underplaying the involving mystery and its tragic repercussions. Instead, the director unwisely chooses to elevate the Gothic mood of his film with a foreboding spookiness better suited for today's younger target audiences and in stark contrast to the novel's tone. Bronte's story remains engaging but its romantic elements become overblown melodramatic flourishes in this Fukunaga's vision.No, this is not a definitive version of the beloved classic tale, but it is a strong and noble attempt at its revision. The film never eludes the shadows of some earlier and more successful film adaptations. This new rendering of Jane Eyre doesn't exactly err ( eyre? ), but it does struggle with its own sense of class distinction and pedigree. Alas, poor plain Jane. GRADE: BNOTE: Old World meets New World in this poster which beautifully captures the world of Victorian England while adding a slightly modern hint of romance that will appeal to today's younger audience. Using the the Wyeth-like face of the film's heroine as its major focus, the image effectively contrasts her with the handsome profile of her suitor in subtle watercolor washes of blue hues. Quite lovely.NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com",Jane Eyre
25,moviexclusive,A sophisticated production that reminds us what it's like to live a life of love and passion,8,21 May 2011,"Forget Alice, here's Jane.After being overshadowed by the colourful backdrops in Alice in Wonderland (2010), Australian actress Mia Wasikowska finally gets to show us her prowess as the titular character in this British romance drama. Based on the 1847 novel of the same name by Charlotte Brontë, this beautiful adaptation of the important feminist classic has Wasikowska playing Jane Eyre, a girl who begins obscure, plain and little, but eventually matures to become a confident whole woman.The era was 1840s. Our heroine starts off with a bleak childhood, where unkind adults made life difficult for the poor girl. Despite the suffering, she grows up to become a governess and meets a mysteriously cold and abrupt man in her new position. Their relationship strengthens and she finds herself falling in love with the man of the house. Just as she thinks that happiness is finally upon her, a terrible secret threatens to destroy it forever.Younger viewers may not realise how influential the original literature text was, thus overlooking its importance in today's society. With the advent of noisy and CGI laden blockbusters in cineplexes, it is easy to ignore films like this one. After many TV series, musical productions and film adaptations, it is important to take stock and introduce this tale of love and independence to the contemporary audience.Beautifully filmed by Brazilian cinematographer Adriano Goldman, this polished production has an alluring brooding and moody quality which is nothing but luscious when viewed on the big screen. Be prepared to immerse yourself in the awe inspiring landscapes of London, Derbyshire and Chatsworth, where residences bear a foreboding presence, portraying the cooped up frustrations of the protagonist. The clothing style of that foregone era also had a unique look – and thanks to Academy Award winning costume designer Michael O' Connor (The Duchess), you have to give credits to the cast for donning those costumes which probably made movement rather difficult.At its simplest, the 120 minute film is a love story. It is also a tale of how a woman wants to be recognised for her individual's worth. Watch out for the scene where Wasikowska's Jane Eyre agrees to marry her employer Mr Rochester after proclaiming herself as his equal. The 21 year old actress personifies that respected spirit with much gusto, and proves herself to be one of the finer actresses of her time. The character's subsequent decision to leave Mr Rochester is also a testament of her personal demand to be treated as an indpendent human being with her own needs and talents. As one sees Wasikowska wandering through the vast grasslands to Academy Award winning composer Dario Marianelli's (Atonement) gorgeous score, it is hard not to feel the triumph of the human spirit.Director Cary Fukunaga also had a talented cast to work with on his second feature film project. Michael Fassbender (Inglourious Basterds) plays the idealised but flawed male protagonist Mr Rochester, who is tricked into an unfortunate marriage before meeting our heroine. The German born Irish actor exudes an appealing charm which complements the character's personality. English actor Jamie Bell (The Eagle) plays a clergyman who later befriends Jane Eyre, while Academy Award winner Judi Dench (Shakespeare in Love) plays a kind and respectful housekeeper who disapproves of Jane Eyre's relationship with her employer.With a stellar cast and fine production values in place, what's required of you as a member of the audience is to use your heart to fully appreciate the film's admirable themes of love, passion and independence. www.moviexclusive.com",Jane Eyre

The only reason I was exciting about this movie was to see Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender. Jane Eyre is really interesting story and it was presented in very engaging way. Though, at sometimes I felt more than a movie it seemed like English theater where more emphasizes was on the dialogues than the pace and thrilling moment of the movie. Mia Wasikowska is a talented young actress who has been impressing in every movie she appeared in since Alice in Wonderland. Jane Eyre has to be her toughest role till now and she did with it with utmost conviction. Michael Fassbender is simply amazing, every time I see this man I get mesmerized by his performance. Michael Fassbender has proved himself From Hunger, Eden Lake, Cat Fish, 300, Inglorious Bastard, Centurion to crap movies like Blood Creek & Jonah Hex. Jaime Bell didn't get much scope. Still he was good. Holiday Greinger and Imogen Poots were okay in insignificant roles. Overall, Jane Eyre is a good movie, if watched as an English theater drama.

28,blumdeluxe,Between superb and average,7,18 April 2017,"I am one of those viewers, for which ""Jane Eyre"" was the first time they got in contact with this story. That said, I cannot judge the film in comparison to other versions. Nonetheless a good movie should always provide enough background to be understandable for new viewers as well.From all that I can say, ""Jane Eyre"" is very thoroughly made and achieves greatness in terms of filmmaking. You instantly see that a lot of thoughts and heart was put into the film to create a somewhat authentic atmosphere and a setting that makes it easy to enter the historic world the plot is settled in. Those preparations are met with skillful and empathetic acting and thus it is right to say that ""Jane Eyre"" is a good movie.Unfortunately, the story itself is kind of average. Without doubting that from a personal point of view it includes big drama, it relays on a setting already dealt with in many movies and books. Although ""Jane Eyre"" is probably one of the earlier attempts to deal with this in art, there are tons of similar plots, including modern adaptions like ""Pretty Woman"", that more or less ground on the same presumption. Unluckily, Jane herself is a hero free from failures and thus an extraordinary boring figure. Her manner of being gentile and empathetic from beginning to the end are honorable but also highly unrealistic and make the movie a bit foreseeable.All in all, ""Jane Eyre"" depicts an average story with average characters in a high-quality way.

While the story within the film is good, I suspect that it would be worthwhile to read the classic novel to gain a richer understanding.The production values are beautiful.

30,tim-764-291856,Says Nothing New...,7,17 September 2012,"With so many versions and adaptations of the classic Charlotte Bronte novel, it now requires something rather more than yet another 'faithful adaptation' to keep us all enthralled.True, I'm not a devoted fan but know the story well enough by now and as I watched this on Sky Movies premier, the suitably ordinariness of its production and direction, basically meant that it came down to casting. The only version that I will watch again, when it's on, is the 1943 Orson Welles/Joan Fontaine black & white classic, but others have faded fast since from memory.Here, a perfectly suitable and rather coolly distant Mia Wasikowska plays the titular Jane and Michael Fassbinder as, again, a rather ordinary Edward Rochester. Perhaps cinematic understatement is the watch word today, but it hardly gets us hooked, those which need hooking, of course! The result, at least for me was a pleasant and uninvolving re- run of the story. Jamie Bell struck me as the best performance as St John Rivers, but I maybe biased toward him as I've followed his career closely since Billy Elliot and it's great to see him make good and decent career choices. Dame Judi Dench, of course, do can do no wrong either, so she's always a pleasure and here she's Mrs Fairfax.So, fans of the Bronte's and the 'classics' and their adaptations will no doubt find much in this, but for those of us who will watch a good period drama when it's on, it is little more than just okay.

The story has obviously been dramatised numerous times in the past. The lead actors Mia Wasikowska (Eyre) and Michael Fassbender (Rochester) certainly put in good performances, but I was never really engaged in the film.

33,Danusha_Goska,Dreary Botch; Fassbender is Great,1,16 January 2012,"Cary Fukunaga's 2011 ""Jane Eyre"" is a boring, dreary, monochromatic, misconceived botch. Fukunaga doesn't know who Charlotte Bronte is, but he sure knows his Igmar Bergman. He takes a wild, beloved and accessible book about a vibrantly alive girl and turns it into a pointlessly morose, dry and impenetrable film class experiment. One must ask: why was this film even made? There are so many adaptations of ""Jane Eyre"" out there, including a zombie version – made before the current zombie trend. Who felt a pressing need for a sotto-voce, mud-colored, depressive and anemic ""Jane Eyre"" without adequate lighting? From the first scenes, watching this movie was tooth-grinding torture. Fukunaga's decision to make the film without lighting was a mistake. A dull, gray palette does not equate great art. If nothing else, ""Jane Eyre"" is one of the most colorful books ever written: there are physical fights, screaming mad women, burning castles, calculating belles, tortured and dying orphans, the reunion of long-lost relatives and long- lost lovers, psychic communication, murder attempts, big dogs, and fetching French dancing girls. There are profoundly poignant relationships, not just between Jane and Rochester, but between Jane and Bessie, a servant in her aunt's home, Jane and Helen Burns, a fellow orphan, and Jane and her student, Adele. You really can't film all that in an unlit, dun-colored setting with near-catatonic performances and expect to do it any justice at all. You are just torturing your material for no good reason, trying to turn ""Jane Eyre"" into something it is not. Also, ""Jane Eyre"" is a *Gothic* novel. Gothic tales are supposed to be presented in a manner that is creepy, hair-raising, and over-the-top. There are scenes in ""Jane Eyre"" that cry out for expressionist lighting and ominous music – like in the 1944, Orson Welles / Joan Fontain version which, if nothing else, captured Jane's early years as an impoverished orphan, and the Gothic atmosphere, very well. Jane Eyre, the book's eponymous heroine, is the reason to read the book. Scenes of the mistreatment of small children by callous exploiters are bearable because righteous and irrepressible Jane is your guide through all the bleakness, misery, and injustice. ""Jane Eyre"" 2011 attaches leeches to this little firebrand and attempts to bleed her dry. In the opening scenes of the book, the reader immediately knows that this is one spunky heroine who, fist balled and spine stiff in the face of earthly power, will take the reader for a bumpy but unforgettable ride. Jane fights back. Jane demands respect. Jane stands up to everyone, from a cousin who beats her, to a rich aunt who controls her fate, to a sadistic manager of an orphanage, to her ""master"" at her first job. Jane never stops giving lip, standing up, insisting on the worth of one of the most wretched of the earth.""Jane Eyre"" 2011 opens with Jane sobbing and wandering aimlessly and prostrate on a rock. Why did Cary Fukunaga turn vibrant, feisty, colorful Jane Eyre into this limp, gray, pathetic loser? Was the real Jane of the book too much for him? There's one good bit in this botch: Michael Fassbender is an excellent Rochester, one of the very best. Enjoying his performance got me through this film. Mia Wasikowska could have made for a very good Jane, but her performance, like the rest of the film, is drained of passion. It's as if Fukunaga instructed his performers to play every scene as quickly and flatly as possible: ""Here you are asking her to marry you. Play it as if you are asking her which subway train goes uptown. And remember – you are distracted, not really present, and in a hurry."" There's no feeling in anything here, and ""Jane Eyre"" is one of the most feeling books ever written. It is a deeply passionate book, and this film is as flat as cold as and as dry as the tundra. Tundras have some purpose, though, and I can see none for this film.",Jane Eyre

The story is fascinating, although slow paced, being presented in a series of intertwined sequences from the past, present of future, drawing you into its old world, with magnificent scenery, making you care about the characters.The actors' performance is also noticeable, excellent I must say, making their characters credible.

Tragic and romantic, it appeals to those who crave for words to sound like a melody and keeps hope burning. I don't care if it sounds corny, that's how I felt about it. The character of Jane Eyre is one that is ideal, except of course to chauvinists. In this 2011 version of the movie, Mia Wasikowska performs her role magnificently. A glance at her filmography shows she is in much demand; all her performances, the ones I've seen, are evidence as to why that is. I am happy to see the ratings for this particular movie, from all my usual sources, are consistent and very favourable; it reassures me enough people have taste.All those who loved the book, and there are plenty, will enjoy this movie.

I honestly can't say if this movie is a good interpretation of the book or not but what I will say is for a period drama it is very well written, directed with solid acting from everyone involved especially by (Mia Wasikowska) who plays Jane Eyre aswell as (Michael Fassbender) who plays Mr Edward Rochester and an amazing performance by (Judi Dench) who plays Mrs. Fairfax.I highly recommend watching Jane Eyre (2011) even if you have never read the book the movie does a great job at providing proper character backgrounds aswell as detailed character development that makes this classic story easy to follow for people who are new to the story and it's characters.This classic tale of love and tragedy is one that has withstood the test of time with it's elegant writing and sophisticated dialogue that will leave you wanted more. I came away from this movie honestly wanting to read the original classic aswell as other classic romance novels which is something I didn't expect I hope others have the same experience watching Jane Eyre (2011).",Jane Eyre
37,Offworld_Colony,Hard to put into words how visceral and palpable and engrossing this gothic mystery romance thriller is.,9,6 February 2020,"Fukunaga's camerawork and Dario Marianelli's electric score, betray the composed, contained demeanour of the Mia Wasikowska's titular character; a performance that is award-worthy and shows Mia as a rich, new talent. I'm not aware of the other films and I haven't read the book - but I was riveted by the non-linear style and the brisk, brusque editing and Moira Buffini's faithful, respectful dialogue and dedication by all the actors. I enjoyed the smallness of this version, the intimacy, the money in the right place, and a bold, almost horror-movie approach to this timeless story.",Jane Eyre
38,TaylorYee94,"no sadness, no happiness, no joy... no emotions in this movie.",7,27 April 2021,"It is always so difficult to adapt great literature into the movie. Sometimes the literature is chopped, distorted, and modified horribly, missing out the important epiphany or failing to connect each episode smoothly. At least, 'Jane Eyre' does not make this kind of mistake. It captures most of the important developments of the story and stays faithful to the original. The problem is the lack of emotions of character and of the storyline. I'm sure Wasikowska worked hard to portray untroubled and reserved Jane Eyre wiser than her age. However, within the continuity of calmness, the character Jane Eyre should be allowed to display some subtle emotions. After all, Mr. Rochester loves Eyre's smile in the book. The plot development is so plain and flat without any dynamics, opposite of the literature as well.I also want to mention the lack of chemistry between Eyre and Rochester and abrupt ending. If Jane Eyre had a little bitty more cheerfulness and emotions, it would have been better chemistry. AND the ending is very unkind, wrapping up the whole thing without giving time to process (which was supposed to be) moving moment of reunion. (Again, the lack of emotion is a problem)",Jane Eyre
39,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Enthralling. Enchanting. Ethereal.,8,4 August 2011,"I'm a huge sucker for 19th century period films when they're done right, and Cary Fukunaga's Jane Eyre adaptation is, for my money, the finest one to be released since Joe Wright's Pride & Prejudice. Fukunaga was an inspired directorial choice for a work like this, his only previous feature being the Mexican crime saga Sin Nombre, and he couldn't have fit the part better. He nails the enchanting beauty that make period films so enthralling for me, but he also hits all of the aspects that make Jane Eyre unique from other films of it's type. The powerful feminist statement is well in tact without being overbearing and Fukunaga nails the eerie, chilling mystery aspect of Eyre without making the film uneven.Fukunaga doesn't miss a beat when it comes to the multiple realms the film digs into. In one five minute period we can go from a tense drama about the unconventional sexual desires of two people to the intrigue of a man with a secret to a paranoia horror where something is lurking behind the wall. Most directors would fail miserably at trying to capture all of these different tones, but Fukunaga somehow creates one tone that simultaneously captures every aspect of the story. Nothing feels out of place and everything is equally compelling.While Fukunaga delivers in every single way, it's no surprise that rising stars Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender are what make the film. Wasikowska plays the titular role with fearless grace, she plays it entirely unselfconscious, stripping her down to the bare woman she is and building a developed, strong woman. She makes every scene interesting, constantly working Eyre's thoughts and emotions just underneath the surface, not afraid to let them out but of the belief that if she let them out they wouldn't really matter. She captures that constant desire for something more than herself, a world where women have the same experience as men, and when Rochester gets introduced her desire for him is instantly recognized. For some reason in cinema it can often be hard to play a strong woman with ideas and desire without making her unlikable and annoying. Wasikowska doesn't tread into that territory for a moment. We are always on Jane's side, no matter what decision she makes, not through a bias in the story but because of how convincingly Wasikowska plays the role.If you've followed me or have read my posts at all, you know that I am a massive fan of Michael Fassbender and any new performance of his is cause for celebration for me. So it's no small feat when I claim his work as Rochester to be his best performance so far, without a doubt. Rochester is a very hard role to pull off; he starts off as this powerful, looming, terrifying figure and slowly we have to be let in to this emotional, beaten soul with a dark secret. We have to first understand why he frightens Jane and then slowly understand why she falls in love with him. Fassbender pulls all of this sensationally; when we are first introduced to him he is immediately terrifying but even then we can tell that there is something underneath the surface. As Jane slowly unravels this hardened, tortured man, Fassbender becomes an almost tragic figure that we feel for deeply. His sexuality pours off the screen, and he's got more heart than he can contain in his chest. It's a very struggled, internal performance and Fassbender is phenomenal; then when he gets to let all of that pain and emotion come pouring out, we refuse to turn away for a moment. This is the kind of performance that sticks with you.Individually they are both magnificent, but the real power of the film is when the two of them are on screen together. From the moment they meet, their sexual tension is palpable and my eyes were more than glued to the screen every time they were on it together. As the film progresses, their desires grow and it slowly becomes harder and harder for the two to keep their emotions in check. They're bursting at the seams, but the two actors are marvelous at making almost everything internal until the appropriate moment to let them out. And I'll try not to spoil anything, but when that moment comes it is absolutely overwhelming. The film brought me to tears three specific times, two with joy and one with absolute devastation. It's a marvelous work that brought intense emotion out of me, thanks in large part to these performances and a story that keeps most of it's emotion stuck underneath until it reaches a boiling point. I've heard some people complain about the ending, declaring it abrupt, but I felt it to be the perfect way to finalize such a beautiful, magnetic work. In fact, I think it was the only way to end it; and boy did the tears roll down for me.",Jane Eyre
40,Eternality,Fukunaga's Jane Eyre stars Mia Wasikowska in an extraordinary performance.,8,23 May 2011,"I don't think anyone would be bothered to count how many book-to-screen adaptations of Jane Eyre there have been since the dawn of cinema. Rest assured, there have been many. The latest by director Cary Fukunaga, who won the top directing award for Sin Nombre (2009) at Sundance, appears to be another in a long line of such adaptations. But in truth, it could be one of the best versions ever. Based on the influential novel of the same name by Charlotte Bronte published in England in the mid-19th century, Fukunaga's Jane Eyre stars Mia Wasikowska in an extraordinary performance.Very much a bleak love story (at least in the context of this film) set in a time of formality and restrain, Jane Eyre is a period piece costume drama that despite its slow pacing and abstract dialogue manages to be self-sustaining without going too far in indulging in theatrics. Wasikowska plays the title role Jane who is righteous, moral, compassionate, and mature. She meets a man (her employer really) with a troubled past and feels attracted to him. His name is Edward Rochester (Michael Fassbender). Pain and conflict ensues when he unwillingly confesses a terrible secret to her.Screenwriter Moira Buffini has a lot of material to cover, but the choice to focus on the love story and relegate Jane's backstory to several flashbacks is still effective as it is inevitable. Like every other screen adaptation of a literature novel, it is impossible to shoot a picture without some form of expository condensation. Wasikowska's Oscar-worthy performance is near flawless. She brings to her character a perpetual sense of psychological unease. Jane is a confident young lady, but moments of self-doubt and fear remain consistent blights in her understanding of the world she was brought into.Fukunaga's direction is as composed as the camera that beautifully captures the idyllic lifestyle of the film's characters. Yet, there seems to be a constant cast of gloom, brought about by dark skies, heavy rain, and claustrophobic corridors lit up by the eerie glows of candlelight, all of which builds up to a suspenseful mood that reflects the novel's brooding quality. There are some scenes that feel more at home in a Gothic-inspired horror film like The Others (2001) than an orthodox costume drama, at times putting viewers unnecessarily on edge.For all of its supposed secret passion and forbidden love, Jane Eyre remains surprisingly tame in its portrayal of the Jane-Edward relationship, which not only fails to convince us of their unequivocal love for each other, but also seems curiously half-baked. Fortunately, the redeeming factor that is Wasikowska's singular heartbreaking performance, and the picturesque backdrop of which this tale is set ensure that the coldness of the romantic relationship does not dilute the quality of this quite excellent Jane Eyre adaptation.GRADE: B+ (8/10 or 3.5 stars)www.filmnomenon.blogspot.comAll rights reserved.",Jane Eyre
41,dy158,Re-inventing an age-old classic,7,3 September 2012,"There is always a certain degree of expectation ahead of watching an adaptation based on something once read. All the more it is based on a novel where there have been a number of interpretations over the years. So how does one interpret the novel that is known to be among Charlotte Bronte's best-known works and one of the most known works in Victorian literature, and stand out from past interpretations?For those who have read the novel before, the story is well-known. It is the story of the title character who grew up knowing nothing about her dead parents, from her childhood (Amelia Clarkson as Young Jane) living with her relatives in the Reed family along with the likes of her aunt Mrs. Reed (Sally Hawkins), to her education at Lowood where she has a confidante in Helen Burns (Freya Parks) who always see the good in people despite how the latter is being treated, to working as a governess at Thornfield and meets the housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax (Judi Dench) and her French-speaking pupil Adele Varens (Romy Setton Moore) before the owner of the house shows up in Edward Fairfax Rochester (Michael Fassbender) who has his own story to tell, but it is filled with mystery before it all came down on Jane on what was supposed to be the biggest day of her life.The unique thing about the film adaptation from up-and-coming director Cary Fukunaga is the manner of how the age-old classic which is among the best-known works of Victorian literature is being presented on the big screen. It is being told in flashbacks, with it began as adult Jane (Mia Wasikowska) running on the moores before collapsing on the ground while it was raining before the Rivers siblings in St. John (Jamie Bell), Mary (Tamzin Merchant) and Diana (Holliday Grainger) accepted her into their house. More flashbacks began to return for Jane as they intertwine with her settling in with the Rivers, which led to Jane recalling how life used to be for her since a young girl growing up onwards, with her life far from being perfect.As Jane Eyre was released in the 1840s, the setting of the film also stays true with how the various aspects of Victorian England are being depicted. That is in reference of the outfits regardless of the various characters' place in the society in those days, the furniture that were used, the societal behaviour of those Jane meets since her childhood where it encapsulates the best in two scenes which involve both Mrs. Fairfarx and Jane with the former informing the latter of their place in society and the latter and her view of the world and how being a governess has restricted it. But just the like the novel itself, it is also fill with suspense and the Gothic elements that come with it.The film adaptation may look possibly a little confusing for the discerning reader of the novel at first, but as it progresses, Jane's life story is being presented to the audience. The saving graces for this reviewer are how especially the major characters apart from Jane herself, in terms of how close their characteristics and mannerisms as they were portrayed on screen and how it was depicted in the novel. People like Mrs. Reed, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele Varens, St. John Rivers and Edward Rochester. It felt as it progresses, it is returning back to how this reviewer would have imagined when she first read the novel. There were times it felt like there were disjointed scenes where the flow of the film adaptation does not seemed to be there, with a handful of the major story lines not being presented on screen, where it could have help to explain to those who may not have read the novel before.Still overall, considering this is director Cary Fukunguna's second work, it is quite an accomplishment where the majority of the storyline as per the novel is being shown on the screen itself, more or less staying true to one of Charlotte Bronte's best-known works.",Jane Eyre
42,Ryan_MYeah,"Beautiful, performed superbly by Mia Wasikowska, and appropriately subtle.",8,5 September 2011,"'m gonna get into my review of Jane Eyre, based on the classic novel by Charlotte Bronte.Centering on young, seemingly emotionless girl, Jane Eyre (Played terrifically by Mia Wasikowska), the film follows her struggles through an orphaned childhood, and then to the age of 19, a time where she now works as a governess for a rich, but cold Englishman (Played by Michael Fassbender). Over time, it appears as though the two of them fall for one another, and it seems as if Jane has finally become happy, but what follows is a series of mysterious twists, and routes paved with emotional devastation.Jane Eyre, to the mistaken eye, could strike someone as being just another overly produced period drama - akin to The Young Victoria - without even having seen it. To the eye willing to give it a chance, the film is a more thoughtful, austere, and subtle piece of storytelling. Director Cary Fukunaga and screenwriter Moira Buffini take time to develop their characters and story lines without compromising the tone they establish.This is just as much a benefit to the actors as it is to the story, including miss Wasikowska. A gem of a performer, indeed, she embodies the role of Jane seamlessly. Though her facial expressions may appear dry, the true acting lies within her eyes, and what her character is thinking. It's a powerful expression of quiet emotion that easily makes her the MVP of the cast, and that's saying something, considering that she has to hold her own against the likes of Michael Fassbender and Judi Dench.I must also applaud the film's visual designers for contributing lovely work to the movie. The cinematography is soft and flowing, the production design is exceptionally conceived, and the costumes are designed with typical period appropriate elegance, but also with character and personality in mind to contribute to that.Superbly acted, beautifully designed, and well told: All in one. I give Jane Eyre *** out of ****",Jane Eyre
43,Hallelujah289,"Poetic seeming, but what really does it say?",5,13 November 2021,"I have now watched six consecutive Jane Eyre film and tv series adaptions and also freshly read the Jane Eyre novel in the form of audiobook. I maintain that no adaption is faultless but neither is the novel I now consider it is adapted from having the read the novel just now after a matter of years. Still perhaps as filmmaking this Jane Eyre (2011) adaption is less satisfactory than others though probably not wrong in drawing from the novel a view of the central romance as sordid, hastily put upon an inexperienced and impetuous girl in a most deceitful, contrived and flowery way.True as all that may be of the novel itself there is little here to really recommend the film besides a beauty of cinematography and sound design and probably most of the actors themselves. Here Jane Eyre is bare faced but stunning and dressed in a way that sets off her waist most of all. And her sharpness is rather sullen and brooding like a teenage girl (that she is wholly meant to be at 18) and Mr Rochester is fevered, nonsensical and unhinged. But all that may be excused as they can be interpreted from the novel, except the romance then becomes a mad and lustful infatuation and what then does the ending mean but more teenage folly.The movie has a gravity and a consideration that should be thought substance, but at the end it's like a haiku (as impressionable film it is) that imparts the message what the deuces (as Mr Rochester would say) did we see in their relationship at all.A change in the background of the St John character and their family (they are not relations in this version) does make Jane seem rather more unconscionable than magnanimous and reckless with her choices.However a change in the reactions of Mrs Fairfax the housekeeper (played by Judi Dench) is quite welcome as she is more thoughtful and thereby Mr Rochester is more cruel when he spurns her in her presence in prior scenes, which further makes him seem unworthy of any happy ending.I can't say I found this adaptation likable but it is at least interesting and well done with the way it pieces together bits and pieces of dialog from various book scenes and transplants them to occur differently or out of order.M.",Jane Eyre
44,gregking4,a visually sumptuous and handsomely mounted production,6,31 May 2011,"This is the umpteenth version of Charlotte Bronte's classic novel of a plain, obscure and poor orphan girl who lands a job as a governess and eventually captures the heart of her mysterious employer. This 22nd version of the timeless Gothic romance is a visually sumptuous and handsomely mounted production, but it is also quite bland and dull. Technical contributions are excellent, from Adriano Goldman's gorgeous cinematography, to Will Hughes-Jones' stunning production design and Michael O'Connor's costumes. Director Cary Fukunaga (the excellent Mexican drama Sin Nombre, etc) brings a foreboding atmosphere to Thornfield, Rochester's imposing, dark and brooding home. When we first meet Jane she is scrambling across a rain soaked and windswept moor before arriving at the home of St John Rivers (Jamie Bell), who takes her in and cares for her. Then in an extended flashback we learn how she came to be there. Cast out of home by her spiteful aunt (Sally Hawkins) Jane is sent to the austere Lowood Charity School and orphanage. We get a brief glimpse of the appalling conditions and treatment she endures before she is hired as governess to Rochester's young ward. Having previously played Alice in Tim Burton's visually bold version of Alice In Wonderland, Australian actress Mia Wasikowska seems to be the current go to girl for playing virginal heroines of English literature. And she delivers a nicely nuanced performance in a role that has previously been played by the likes of Joan Fontaine, Charlotte Gainsbourg and the late Susannah York. Michael Fassbender (from the recent X-Men First Class, etc) makes for a handsome Mr Rochester, but his performance is fairly perfunctory. In previous versions Mr Rochester has been far more formidable and overbearing, and quite often older. In previous versions the character has been played by George C Scott, Timothy Dalton, Ciaran Hinds and, in the memorable 1943 adaptation, Orson Welles brought his own unique power to the role. There is a lack of passion and fire between the two leads, which also holds the film back. Judi Dench brings her usual class to her performance as Mrs Fairfax, the kindly housekeeper. Moira Buffini's screenplay is surprisingly atmospheric and literate, and has pared the novel back to the essentials. However, it is virtually impossible to fit Bronte's novel into a two-hour movie, which is why the tale is best suited to the mini-series format, and the 1973 epic mini-series is arguably the best version. We are still waiting for the definitive big screen adaptation of Jane Eyre.",Jane Eyre
45,ArizWldcat,Very well done!,9,23 April 2011,"Jane Eyre is my absolute all time favorite book. I have seen many different film versions of this over the years. I loved the Orson Welles version, the Timothy Dalton version, and the Toby Stephens version. I was not too crazy about the Ciaran Hinds version (although I do like Hinds as an actor in other films), and absolutely HATED the 1996 version which starred William Hurt. That particular film managed to change the characters so much that they were unrecognizable. Besides, it's just blasphemy to have an American playing Mr Rochester!!I was nervous about this version of the film, as generally, the story is too long and complicated to be told in a two hour format. Those who are extremely familiar with the story may find this film to be lacking their favorite bits of the story. I can understand that. I did find a bit of that in this film. Parts of it seemed rushed as many of the scenes were combined or cut short in the film as compared to the book. One aspect that seemed odd was that Grace Poole's character is nearly non-existent in this film (she does appear briefly in the scene which finally reveals Mr. Rochester's deep dark secret). Having to leave out parts of the book is to be expected when making a Jane Eyre movie, and for the most part, the film stayed true to the essence of the book.Mia Wasikowska, as Jane, has captured the fiery spirit of the character as portrayed in the book. Michael Fassbender is a fine Rochester, not being particularly handsome (as in the book), he is charismatic yet brooding. Judi Dench adds much in her role as Mrs. Fairfax (of course), and Jamie Bell makes a severe St. John Rivers. Overall, I enjoyed this version of Jane Eyre very much. It managed to stay true to Bronte's characters while telling a compelling story. I liked the flashback vehicle of telling the story (this was also used in part, in the BBC version which featured Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson).If I want the whole detailed story, I can still watch the 1984 BBC version which featured Timothy Dalton. To this day, that version, while leaving a lot to be desired in production value (cheesy sets, make up, etc)tells the story that is most complete.**A bit of a spoiler follows** One thing that annoyed me about this film is that the Rivers family in the book is revealed (to Jane's happiness) to be Jane's cousins; her mother and their father were siblings. That they were truly cousins was left out of this movie, instead the Rivers agreed to ""adopt"" Jane into their family; make her their ""honorary"" sister. This made little sense and seemed silly to me. Part of the appeal of the story is that poor Jane thinks she is utterly alone in the world and then turns out not to be. Family connections are very important to Jane Eyre, and for her to find that she indeed has family who love her is one of my favorite parts of the book! I don't know why the screenwriter chose to leave the cousin aspect out of the film. *(The squeamishness of marrying cousins was also in the previous BBC version (Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson), where Jane in that film exclaims that she and St. John are ""half cousins""...What??? Her mother and his father are siblings...that makes them FULL cousins, doesn't it???) IT seems to me that the custom of first cousins marrying in times past is well known and to pretend it didn't ever happen is to rewrite history.Another aside: another reviewer expressed dismay that Jane is made an heiress in this film. Go back and read the book! It's in the book and also included in many previous versions of the film.",Jane Eyre
46,perkypops,Lovingly etched adaption of Bronte classic,8,18 September 2012,"It is rare for a film adaptation of Jane Eyre to eschew the dramatic outbursts of the apparent wild woman who haunts the life of Mr Rochester in favour of a really close look at the character of Miss Eyre in such profound depth. And this film really does play homage to Charlotte Bronte's wonderful story about love, duty, respect, and desire.Not only is this a terrific adaptation it has that rare atmosphere of the moors where the Bronte's grew up, vividly caught in the superb cinematography. This is not another Hollywood dramatisation, emphasising the moments of drama in order to squeeze every last ounce of love from the plot. Here is a humble but far from downtrodden Jane, a beauty not in the pure visual sense, but in the most profound of human ways. Her intelligence, sensitivity and grace blossom through every scene. It is the best portrayal of her character I have seen on film.The acting is so cleverly pitched to the Bronte notes and the whole is produced as much through love as through profession. A rare treat.",Jane Eyre
47,johnpierrepatrick,Another adaptation... Could have been avoided without any regret,4,21 August 2020,"I honestly don't see what this new adaptation (shall I call it a remake) brings.
Past adaptations are far better and Fukunaga does not offer a new vision of the book nor of any character.It really lines up with current tendency to make remakes with illustrates more a lack of ideas and originality.
One of a thousand may be the equal of the original or even better. A handful deserves to be shot as it brings new ideas to the original.
The rest brings at most modern special effects or an opportunity to see great actors in famous roles, when it is not a simple downgrade.This movie fall in my opinion in the last category.
Do favor the classic, to begin with Orson Welles'!",Jane Eyre
48,arthera09,"Visually capturing and great performances, but I kind of hate the story",7,30 May 2011,"I remembering reading Jane Eyre a few years ago and loved the writing style, the characters, and visual style evoked by Bronte, but hating the story. I think this summarizes how I feel about the movie. The story to me is boring and so overdone that I do not care one bit about it. This might have to do with the fact that I am a man, because everyone women I have talked to love this book, but every other male I have talked to has a similar sentiment about the story. I think I am tired of seeing movies beginning with a scene from the last third of the movie and then building up to it. For most of us watching this movie we already know the storyline so foreshadowing does little for the movie. This movie is a fairly straight forward adaptation of the book in terms of story, but I think Fukunaga has captured the visual style of the book almost spot on. Bronte had a way of describing environments that I think Fukunaga really captured. His choice of using natural lighting worked extremely effectively and was by far the most impressive part of the movie. I would really love to see what Fukunaga and his DP could do with a movie shot in black and white. The soft candle light and how often times the faces were almost complete covered in shadow was extremely effective at creating atmosphere. I really did not feel a lot of the tension that went with discovering the wife in the attic and there was little build up to the final reveal. Perhaps that is because I already knew what was in the attic, but the tension from the book was lost here. Mia Wasikowska is obviously is a beautiful young women who managed to transform herself into the plain Jane that she needed to be while maintaining the allure that would draw Rochester in. She was absolutely fantastic in the role and it would not surprise me if she is nominated for a few awards for this performance. Fassbender was not as good, but was still alluring in his own way. I really missed some of the deeper conversations that Rochester and Jane share with each other in the book and I think the inclusion of some more of their dialog with each other would have fleshed out Rochester as a character a bit more. It was not completely convincing to me that the two of them should fall in love, but that is possibly because I am cynical. I loved this movie visually and the lighting really captured how I imagined Bronte's world. Bookended by two fantastic lead performances the movie can be a real treat to watch. If I did not hate the story so much then I am sure this would rank higher. This is really a shame that I feel like this because this is a truly impressive film, but I will recommend to some of my friends just to see how they feel about the lighting.",Jane Eyre

Jane Eyre, easily the most popular and influential literary work ever gets the treatment it deserves with this masterful and finely tuned adaptation.A lot of previous TV and movie versions have seemed to concentrate on one part of the story and neglected other parts, every factor of this amazing story is present here. I really like the way the narrative works, beginning with a later part of the story and using flashbacks throughout, I found this worked in the films favor extremely well.The locations are LUSH to say the least, the moors are almost a character themselves, I found myself just wanting to step into the screen and live in this dark dark land, the castle used is excellent in creating the Gothic horror element of the film. The casting of Australia's very own Mia Wasikowska is sublime, she gives the finest performance of the character I have ever seen, I think that her performance will go down in a lot of people's opinions as the greatest. The opening scene is pure acting brilliance, and the scene where she tells Rochester why she is leaving Thornfield (am i a machine without feelings) had me in tears.

51,julian-mumford,Jane Eyre rebooted perhaps....,7,15 February 2012,"Director Cary Fukunaga takes a modern approach to Bronte's most famous novel, exaggerating the Gothic elements and providing Mia Wasikowska with every opportunity stretch herself in the title role and prove her acting skills.Following a brief introduction we are transported back to Jane's childhood which makes the upbringings depicted by Dicken's seem like a holiday camp. The church kindly taking on the problem child when her guardian finds her tiresome, then systematically mentally dismantling her, advising all other children to shun her and ""withhold the hand of friendship"", all in the name of pious religion and protecting her from the fires of hell, of course.Forward to her ""release"" Jane is fortunate to find gainful employment as a governess in a large isolated house, Thornfield Hall, surrounded by cold desolate moors, only lightened by a well intentioned house keeper (Judi Dench). Jane's ward, a young french girl, according to her guardian has neither looks or intelligence sufficient to gain a husband, occupies her time. The guardian Edward Fairfax Rochester (Michael Fassbender) arrives months later by horseback, Jane failing to make a good first impression on her employer whilst out walking, causing the horse to rear and him to fall.The gruff but good hearted master of the house is starved of intelligent conversation, he engages in an enjoyable spar of wits and opinions with his governess, intrigued and amused at her obvious intelligence and firmly held views of her own. Isolated house, enigmatic master, pretty governess, albeit made to look dowdy, repressed Victorian social mores, what do you think is likely to happen? The film plays with timelines jumping forward and back with Jane's later flight into the kindly arms of the local young minister (Jamie Bell) and his twin sisters. Jane, seeking refuge, following an event at Thornfield Hall is nursed back into, if not polite society but at least isolated, school mistress, muddy and wet society.The film manages to create a real feeling of isolation, repressed desires, things left unsaid and frankly odd behaviour, usually originating from Rochester, who clearly has issues to work though, although all will be revealed.Wasikowska makes for a very believable Jane, investing her with enough reality and naievity to become a real person we recognize but infusing her with a steel backbone, this is a woman that can and will cope with anything, in this story that's just as well. Jane knows what she wants and does not believe her demands as a woman to live a life of her choosing, to be loved and not subject to violence and cruelty to be unrealistic. Opinions that would have been contentious at the time of the original novel's publication in 1847.Fassbender continues to impress, Dench provides solid support and Bell does a reasonable job in a difficult and seemingly thankless role. Thornfield House is a character in itself, darkly lit, creaking and exuding menace and secrets from every joist.The end does appear somewhat rushed, the resolution to some of Jane's woes convenient and these elements may not provide the required redemption for those not familiar with the book.Summary Overall a solid effort with engaging acting especially from Wasikowska, trailers might indicate this to be more of a Gothic horror which is misleading and might discourage some. There is little to fear for those of a sensitive disposition.A classic story told in a refreshing way, Jane Eyre rebooted perhaps and might inspire yet more readers to discover this classic in page form.",Jane Eyre
52,cnycitylady,Worth a watching,7,4 January 2013,"Jane Eyre's story is probably one of the most famous Gothic love tales. And in attempts in the past they have always missed the mark to get this exceptional story portrayed accurately in movie format. But here for the first time in a two hour film they give you immense detail and spot on representations from the book.Mia Wasikowska plays Jane, the orphaned girl who works at Thormfield Hall and who falls in love with the rather mysterious and dreary Mr. Rochester. She was the perfect choice for Jane because her subtle facial expressions and her striking facial features can masterfully convey the thoughts of our heroine. Mia's Jane is shy but certain, glum but hopeful and plain but beautiful. Wasikowska's acting is good and believable although it could have been improved upon with greater passion.Michael Fassbender plays the gloomy Rochester. His portrayal is not the best I've ever seen, as his is more wishing he were angry with the world than genuinely angry, but livens up whenever Wasikowska's in a scene with him. He is very cute in this movie, with his curls and shinning eyes.The story line is shortened when they take out some of the details from the book, but they still incorporate the essence of the tale. (at least more so than the 1997 one) The supporting characters are sub accurately portrayed, at least with Judi Dench's character. In the book I found her more matter-of-fact but in the movie she comes off as mean and belittling. And John Rivers is too apathetic for my taste. Again in the book I found him only superficially apathetic, a ""faux un-care-er"" whereas in the film he genuinely doesn't give a hoot.The directing and the script are both excellent and the scenery really draws you in despite the gray-ish tinge. You find that you care about what happens to this girl, even though you are not entirely sure as the ending is rather abrupt.Overall this movie is pretty good, I give it a 7.5 in total although it says 7 up top. If you like period pieces then you'll like this one.",Jane Eyre
53,u-32187,Jane eyre,7,2 April 2020,"The film manages to entertain as well as inform. Purists may object to the last 3 lines of the film which hint at a slightly happier denouement than the book offered. In spite of that, Jane Eyre is still a nearly flawless film.",Jane Eyre
54,rebecca-ry,A Great Story,8,12 March 2012,"'Jane Eyre' is a very well-made film. There are no outstanding flaws which ruin the entire experience and in fact, it's difficult to find much wrong with the film at all. The acting is pretty good, Mia Wasikowska plays Jane Eyre remarkably well, she suits the character in both looks and acting skills. Michael Fassbender performs well also but his performance is over-shadowed by Wasikowska's. Other actors such as Judi Dench and Jamie Bell act very well and don't let the film down at all. The costume design in this picture is really well done also, some of the outfits are beautiful and there is no point where any outfits look unrealistic or do not suit the time period. If you have read the book you will of course have a better understanding of the plot at the beginning. If not, it can be a bit confusing but you will eventually begin to understand things as the film goes on. This is the only minor flaw I could see with this film, it is shot beautifully on Dartmoor with really great shots during all four seasons. Overall, I would recommend this film. Even if you have not read the book there is still a good chance you will enjoy and appreciate this film simply because it is a great story.",Jane Eyre
55,MegaSuperstar,Uninspiring Jane Eyre,5,22 August 2017,"Precious film aesthetically speaking, with nice sets and costume designs. But considering the high amount of Jane Eyre versions that have been filmed a new one should add something new, different or better to the audiences than its precedents. Sadly, this is not the case: its lack of interest is mainly due to performances -Mr. Fassbender's specially- and too flat direction. Miss Wasikowska develops her character well and makes us believe is true. She creates a believable Jane but walks along the film like a shadow, too distant to emphasize with her. Fassbender's Mr. Rochester is much worse: being always a disagreeable character, while in other versions you could see how he really suffers and almost touch and feel his pain feeling sorry for him here Michael Fassbender does not seem very interested in making his character credible; he does not manage to reach the intensity that Rochester requires, appearing more annoyed than tortured. He does not manage to make us feel sorry for him. Best performance is done by Mrs. Dench, but unfortunately she has a brief and not noticeable appearance. Directors' work does contribute too to these poor results by not using his resources emphasizing what actors lack. All and all, a new version of the film correct, visually enjoyable but that does not bring anything new to the previous ones.",Jane Eyre
56,u-emoli,Beautiful,10,6 June 2019,"Now, this is a gorgeous film. So beautifully filmed , acted and directed. I've had it on my list for a long time, but I've never expected to like it so much. Beautiful and absorbing.",Jane Eyre
57,Manal1987,Mr. Rochesbender...,5,31 January 2013,"In the following review, I will try my best not to commit the unforgivable sin of comparing the film with Charlotte Bronte's book (even though I do not promise complete detachment).The screenplay is brilliant, best thing about the movie actually. Moira Buffini succeeded in capturing the intense relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester in the fewest, yet most heartfelt, lines possible. Equally beautiful is the cinematography that brings to life the Gothic/romantic atmosphere of the story.Everything seems perfect so far, what is my problem then?.... THE CAST! (or better say the 'miscast'). Mia Wasikowska's was fairly good. However, in her attempt to portray the simplicity and innocence of Jane Eyre, she gave the most nondescript performance ever. As for Michael Fassbender, despite how much I 'love' him, I have to admit he was just not the one for the role. I know that he is an eye-candy and he is capable of spontaneously delivering whatever emotions the character he plays harbors, but his sometimes 'too friendly' and juvenile behavior, his boyish flirting and quick change of attitude towards Jane were so unlike the mysteriously dark Mr. Rochester! Of course I understand that I could be wrong and that Fassbender's unconventional take on Mr. Rochester may actually appeal to some. Nevertheless, when Wasikowska and Fassbender are in a scene together, you cannot help feeling the chemistry between them (I guess the script helped greatly in that).All in all, it is a beautiful movie, not a mind-blower though.",Jane Eyre
58,cheer88,Best Version,9,21 October 2015,"I remember seeing different versions of ""Jane Eyre"" throughout the years. This one could be the best.Almost all the ""Jane Eyre"" I saw before heavily depicted the scene which Edward's insane wife burned down the mansion and subsequently blinded him. Horrors and infernos consumed most of this supposing Gothic romance if not entirely. Neither did I remember any romantic courtships between Jane and Edward nor feel the story was adequately told i.e. noted their undying love. Falling in love at first sight is always a powerful catalyst for men pursuing women. Although Charlotte Brontë humbly described both their appearances, she might merely suggest their mutual attraction forewarned them of seeing each other in an alluring fashion. The director had a vivid understanding of it and infused with ample courting scenes into the film which also enough to transform its genre from horror to romance where the story belonged. The scripts were well crafted and elegantly done. They were not overly theatrical or dramatic. Overall, it's a nice adaption to a familiar classic.",Jane Eyre
59,LouE15,"Different again, a more melancholy Jane Eyre",6,23 April 2012,"This review is full of spoilers, sorry! In addition to the detail about motivation, camera technicalities and great tidbits about the actors to be found in Cary Fukunawa's interesting commentary to the DVD for this film, one thing in particular struck me. He's talking about the scene where Jane hears Rochester calling to her at the height of her emotional conflict with St John Rivers. He compares Michael Fassbender's near-whisper to Orson Welles' booming ""Jane!"" as an illustration of the way acting styles have changed over the decades. I thought that said a lot about the whole approach of this highly atmospheric and relatively quiet film.It isn't helpful to plot the points of divergence between book and film: I'm a fan of all attempts at this wonderful story. Finding the parts of each adaptation that I most enjoy is more than half the fun, so I don't mourn for long the loss of what might seem like important characters or scenes: Grace Poole; Hannah the servant at Moor House; the gypsy scene (showing Rochester's reckless playfulness); the tearing of the veil - something had to go.This version looked undeniably incredible. Shot using minimal assisted lighting, they obviously went to a lot of trouble to make it look and feel and sound right. I liked that the director had spent some time at Haworth Parsonage, thinking not just about Jane Eyre, but about Charlotte Bronte herself. I thought the casting was all pretty good, though I'm fed up with casting directors believing only Judi Dench can do a Judi Dench. Mia Wasikowska in particular was I think terrific as Jane: very close to the bold, lonely, restless girl in my head, despite her striking looks. I can't understand why many have found fault with her restrained performance: I think they're criticising the wrong one.Michael Fassbender was the more problematic lead to me, as a Rochester who certainly looked the part (even without the ugly-beautiful face and the oddly animal frame described in the story). When he was on good form, he filled Rochester's skin pretty well considering what a chameleon-like changeling he is in the book, veering from weary seducer to love-struck schoolboy to Bluebeard. The literary Rochester is ""busy paving Hell with energy""; but in this film he's a calmer, smoother presence. There are frustrating moments, though, when Fassbender seemed to be merely reciting his lines in a low monotone – extraordinary for an actor of his proved range. Two particularly jarring scenes: in his bedroom, where Jane has just saved his life, and he first expresses feelings for her; and the scene in the garden at dawn, when he (supposedly) bitterly taunts her with mention of his ""lovely one"". Were there too many people behind the camera on those days? Considering the spot-on excellence of his acting in other scenes, I found this disconnect with the material incredible. But Fassbender is terrific in his other, better scenes, such as when he and Wasikowska are verbally fencing by the fireside in his study; and when she has finally emerged from her room after their thwarted marriage attempt.I think perhaps it must have been direction: keep it subtle, keep it soft. This isn't very Brontean; yet there are remarkable moments that absolutely nail the mood. Jane looking longingly out from her walled garden/cage at the horizon; Rochester's face, made dark and ugly as he picks out a tune on the piano that makes him think of his hated wife upstairs; his piercing stares as he intuits Jane's thoughts. I loved Jane's quiet, suppressed ""public"" face and the slow private awakenings of her first desire. And for all Jamie Bell may not physically much resemble the godlike blond St John from the book, his forcible challenge to Jane's ""lawless"" passion has all the unforgiving intensity of a Templar bigot from a bygone age. All these memorable things almost make up for the loss of humour. My lasting favourite adaptation is the 1980s TV version starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke; whose powerful performances pay tribute to an almost unabridged script. But I'll still thoroughly enjoy owning this on DVD. I recommend watching the recent TV adaption of ""Wide Sargasso Sea"", taken from Jean Rhys' brooding riposte to the treatment in ""Jane Eyre"" of the story of mad, silenced Other Mrs Rochester.",Jane Eyre
60,DJRMewzique,Well done but somewhat of a dreary bore.,6,12 February 2012,"I certainly can't fault much of Cary Fukunaga's interpretation of Charlotte Bronte's timeless story of a woman who resents being anyone's property and is one of literature's first women to seek independence from men, but I can't say that I found this film particularly entertaining.The story of an orphan girl who was mistreated for most of her life until she finds love in the arms of Mr. Rochester, Fukunaga's film follows the original novel quite closely, though some important details were seemingly deleted for no reason, and can be found in the special features of the DVD.Mia Wasikowska, in a very strong yet dreary performance (also seen this year flexing some excellent acting muscle in ""Albert Nobbs"") plays the titular character in a very honest, earnest fashion, but never seems to enrapture her enough to truly click with the viewer. Michael Fassbender, so strong in a bunch of films this year, including ""X-Men: First Class,"" ""A Dangerous Method"" and ""Shame"" (for which many feel he was robbed of an Oscar nomination), makes it terribly easy to understand why anyone, not just Jane, would fall in love with his terribly handsome face and masculine demeanour. With a cast that is rounded out by incredible names like Judi Dench, Sally Hawkins and Jamie Bell, you'd think the film would be far more enrapturing.However, I just found it very slow moving and dreary and just barely keeping my attention. It is a well-acted and beautifully filmed period piece and the Oscar-nominated costumes are well done, but just like the rest of the film, they are grey and depressing and just not all that attention-grabbing.",Jane Eyre
61,FilmFanatic03,"Slow in pace, but the slightly interesting characters keep you watching",6,15 November 2011,"""Jane Eyre"" is one of those films where you want to praise the film as a classic, but in fact it is not as good as you want it to be. Before I explain the reason why, the positives of this film is the cast. Mia portrays Jane very well and is a great watch, also Michael as Mr. Rochester plays the mysterious character who has a hidden secret very well as well. The visuals of the film is brilliant, very bleak and beautiful. Yet even though there was a story there it didn't feel like much of a story, even though it's not a weak story it just felt like there was not much to it. Also the romance of Jane and Mr. Rochester felt quite rushed despite the fact that both actors had a good chemistry. At the end of the day it all depends on taste, I like stories like ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""Sense and Sensibility"" etc.. but Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"" didn't do it for me. Not a bad film, but not my favourite film.",Jane Eyre
62,tdwillis-26273,Lacks The Heart Of The Classic Story and of Other Adaptations,6,4 June 2017,"I wonder if the higher reviews are from people who have never read the book, or seen other adaptations. This movie did not capture 1/10 of what was possible, with this story.The actors are clearly capable, but have the limits and boundaries of the direction and screenplay and of time restrictions.Although I appreciated the cinematoghraphy, (and the score was wonderful) it was like the rest of the film, went in a direction that when it came together just lacked the HEART of the story and of the other adaptations. The Quality and Intent was there....but in the end,it just fizzled for me.",Jane Eyre
63,JanJanuary,Watchable,3,27 March 2016,"A good adaptation but not the best. I don't know why the BBC funded this when they had their 2006 mini-series version (Ruth Wilson as Jane). I suppose they have so much of our TV licence money (yes it is 2016 and we in the UK are still having to fund the BBC with a compulsory fee of £160), they throw it at any project. Anyway, to the film. It's good with good performances from the leads and Jamie Bell. Unfortunately Dame Judy couldn't make out which accent to use; Yorkshire, upper class English and back again.Not sure why the makers felt the need to chop the story around. We start with Jane leaving Thornfield and arriving at the Rivers' house. It then flashes back to her time at Aunt Reed's house (where the book starts), then to her time at Lowood School and then to Thornfield. Easy enough to follow but unnecessary. It also ends very abruptly. There is much more to tell/show at the end.It was watchable but did we need another version?",Jane Eyre
64,intern-88,Did the world need another Jane Eyre?,8,13 June 2012,"For those of us who went through school with a TV-VHS in every classroom, the book-to-film adaptation will always have a special place in our hearts. After drudging through chapter after chapter of Hardy or Dickens, the immortal words 'We're going to watch the video now' brought more joy than a non-uniform day and an unscheduled fire alarm combined. Not that they were entertaining, far from it, but it was a damn sight better than reading the book.Of course, as you get older you begin to understand the value of the literature that school subjects you to, yet it is still very true that most book-to-film adaptations function as little more than convenient summaries of the text. Directed by Cary Fukunaga, the latest version of Jane Eyre is a perfect example of this. While it is a beautiful retelling of Charlotte Brontë's nineteenth-century classic, its inability to bring anything new to the table makes it a somewhat pointless exercise.The prospect of a new Jane Eyre adaptation is pretty underwhelming. Not only has it been adapted for film over a dozen times, but it has produced four BBC television series and even a graphic novel. Along with Pride and Prejudice and Oliver Twist, it has become one of those projects which filmmakers take on compulsively, each decade producing at least a couple more adaptations to throw on the pile.Needless to say, it's been done to death, so why have another crack at it? With this reincarnation Fukunaga has attempted to be as true to the original as possible in order to create the definitive film version. This may seem like a tall order, but on the whole he does succeed.Where many adaptations end up looking like filmed stage plays, in which little attention is paid to the expressive capabilities of the medium, this film at least remembers it's a film. Whilst Moira Buffini's script is very faithful to the novel, it resists lifting extensive pieces of dialogue verbatim, allowing Fukunaga the space to tell the story visually. The sort of imagery he serves up is pretty predictable; gloomy skies over autumnal woodland etc, but even this small amount of visual flair is effective in creating the sense of isolation which runs throughout the novel.Along with Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë's work is often thought of as a touchstone of giddy sentimental romance, and whilst it would be easy to pander to this misconception, Fukunaga's decision to attend to the novel's darker overtones makes his film one of the more balanced and faithful adaptations. Whilst Jane and Rochester's relationship is undoubtedly the crux of the story, Fukunaga rightfully highlights the shared feelings of loss and regret which brings them together.Whilst Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester are two incredibly challenging characters, Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender bring a restrained intensity to these roles which lends itself well to Fukunaga's realistic rendering of the novel. Where many actors have leaned towards melodrama, Fassbender and Wasikowska's straight-faced performances masterfully convey the seething, unspoken passion which defines Jane and Rochester's love affair.Jane Eyre is indeed a well-worn tale, but by taking a small amount of artistic licence, Fukunaga manages to recapture the intensity of Brontë's novel. The film begins two thirds into the original story, with Jane fleeing Mr Rochester's estate, the action then skips back and forth in time until we arrive back where we started. Whilst this is only a small narrative adjustment it helps to recreate the suspense of the original by disorienting us within the story.Graced by an outstanding cast and an inventive screenplay, Cary Fukunaga has produced a faithful yet taut version of Charlotte Brontë's 164-year- old novel. But for all the inventiveness and delicacy with which he transfers Brontë's words to celluloid, it's difficult not to feel slightly underwhelmed. His devotion to the source material is admirable, but this refusal to bring anything new to the story means it is likely to remain just another big-budget adaptation which will be instantly forgotten as soon as the next one comes along. This film is much like a piece of flat-pack furniture: while one is to be commended for constructing it exactly as per the instructions, with no remaining pieces, it's still not all that impressive.",Jane Eyre

66,szweda-18555,Murky and tedious exposition,4,2 June 2021,Others have expressed their disfavour and disaffection with this treatment of the novel so I will just add my disappointment. At the outset I thought the principal characters did a competent job with what they were given especially Mrs Poole ey oop Dame Judy! But I took a dislike to Mr F when enduring that Alien Covenant debacle (not his fault but...) and personally I have nothing against the actress in the title role but she is not how I saw her in the novel. It is her spirit not her looks at issue here but the prim and improper pretty little thing clashes with my expectation. The cynic in me wonders what Mr F would have made of an altogether plainer Jane... but this one conforms to the Tess and co style and not a lot of substance. Too many blank stares and scurrying about for little plot progress methinks. Too much left unexplained as others have said. I nearly gave up on it but persisted now I wish that I could have my 2 hours back and spend it on reading this essential novel.,Jane Eyre
67,daria84,I disliked this version very much with some exceptions,4,1 September 2013,"I-ll start by saying I've read Jane Eyre maybe 5 times, the last time being about 6 months ago, so I know the tale very well, and while this movie does bring something new to the others, it's just so rushed that a lot of things were left out for me, especially something very important: the evolution of Jane and Rochester's relationship!They jump into falling in love so quickly I barely know how it happened, they barely talked, they never seemed to spend time together, and yet: bam! magically they fell in love. The fire scene was also a shock, that scene is supposed to be charged with tension from both sides, and the only ""tension"" I saw was Rochester nearly naked and him trying to kiss Jane (that didn't happen in the book), both of them were stiff and it felt so forced. And let's not even start with the Orchard scene - woah. Bad in so many levels.Mia Wasikowska was good as Jane, except for the tree scene where she seemed like a child reciting her lines rather than feeling them. Fassbender, well Rochester is a passionate man and Fassbender was stiff and boring, the only scenes where I saw real passion was when him and Jane returned soaking wet to the house after the proposal, when he tried to choke Mason, and in the living room scene where he was ""convincing"" Jane to re-think her decision. Plus, since when Rochester is better looking than St. John?The things I liked though about this movie is Jamie Bell's performance, while he didn't fit the looks, he was cold, severe and great as St John, by far the best one I've seen and now I will picture him when I re-read the book. Mary and Diana were good too (nice to see Lucrecia Borgia again!), and of course, Lady (or Dame?) Judi Dench was excellent as Mrs. Fairfax. The music was fine, the landscape wonderful, it was truly great (except for Ferndean - buried in a deep wood? I saw a nice meadow around)This movie would have been great if it was longer and didn't leave out important parts, such as Rochester confiding in Jane about Celine and just spending time talking, the veil part, her return a bit more heart- felt. And while Michael Fassbender is a great actor, this role just wasn't meant for him.",Jane Eyre
68,Redcitykev,Gothic romance at its very best,8,21 September 2011,"Having seen endless adverts for this film on TV my mother was very keen to go and see it, so, with the help of a very good friend, I arranged a trip to a local multiplex so she could watch the film on a nice big screen, with good sound etc.As she is disabled I had to go with her and my friend, and I have to admit that I was a little fearful that I would sit in the cinema and be bored to tears. What surprised me was that far from this happening I was drawn into the dark, Gothic world of Miss Eyre, Mr Rochester and, of course... Well, that would be giving the game away! What impressed me the most with this film was the way in which it was photographed. Unlike previous version, all bright and breezy and well lit houses etc, this has a washed out, misty feel for the exterior scenes, whilst a lot of the interiors are filmed in candle light, so there are plenty of dark corners and shadows in which secrets lurk and things remain hidden.In terms of the storyline I was impressed by the way the director manages to condense Jane's past into a few telling scenes from her rejection by her Aunt, and her unhappy school days - all of which helped shaped her into the feisty woman that Mr Rochester discovers has been employed as governess to his French speaking ward. Mr Rochester is all smouldering looks and hidden pasts - and it is, naturally, the growing relationship between these two that make up the main body of the narrative. All the performances are excellent, but mention must be given to Jamie Bell as the pastor who, like Mr Rochester, has eyes only for Jane, and Dame Judy Dench who brings great statue to her role as the housekeeper.The film does have moments were things drag a little - some of the early exchanges between Jane and Mr Rochester go on a little longer than they should - but these are few and far between, and overall the film moves at a pace perfect for the unfolding drama.If you like your romances Gothic and with a hint (and more!) of danger, then I would highly recommend this film. And, if like me, you have bad memories of dull 1970s BBC style Sunday afternoon serialisations of great classic novels, go along and see how such a great book can be treated on the big screen!",Jane Eyre
69,mamlukman,Who were they? what happened? what???,2,30 December 2013,"Well, contrary to some people's opinion, not everyone has seen the other 62 versions of this movie or read the book. I've probably seen older versions at some point, but don't really remember them. I'm sure if you've read the book and are a real fan, this movie makes sense. If you are coming to it fresh (me), you have absolutely no idea what's going on. The movie constantly switches time periods, and it's not always clear if we're in the present or the past. Characters trot in and out, and who knows who they were or what their significance is, if anything. Who WERE those mysterious French chicks? No idea. Why are they there? Don't know. Who knows of the existence of the hidden wife? Everyone? Just one servant? Who knows? The movie doesn't tell you. The guy that shows up from Jamaica wounded--who the Hell is he? What relationship does he have to Rochester? How did he get wounded? Why is he forbidden to talk to Jane? None of these questions are answered. I guess you're just supposed to know somehow. Jane leaveswell, it's not clear WHAT she leaves, maybe the orphanage/school??? Or the place, whatever it was, where she went after the school? (not clear) and goes to Rochester's house. I think. Someone (who??? Do we ever see him again??) shows her a modest house and tells her she's going to live there while teaching girls of the villagethe next scene, Jane is in the Big House tutoring one (1) French chick. What happened to the village girls??? Was that just an illusion? A dream? What??? Then they make a point of saying (at the beginning, when she's supposed to be teaching village girls) that Jane would get £15 a year. OK. Great. We see her give one lesson, then, POOF, apparently it's two years later since she's asking for back wages that equal £30. What happened during those two years? Anything? Nothing? As far as the movie's concerned, Jane sees Rochester precisely twice. Then he asks her to marry him. WHAT???? And, of course, out of the blue, because there is absolutely no indication of any interest on his part before his proposal to Jane. On the contrary, he appears to be constantly chatting to some other chick. I dunno. This thing left me scratching my head after every scene shift (and there were a lot of them) asking myself, ""What, did they get the reels mixed up? Did I miss 30 minutes while I took a nap? How does this make any sense at all?""",Jane Eyre
70,scoup,"Don't trouble yourself to give her a character, I'll judge for myself",9,8 April 2012,"I struggled to rate this movie. Immediately after watching, I was fine at 10 so much so that I watched the movie again. Several months later ready to review, I noticed some of the other reviews which discussed earlier versions as superior and truer to the book along with other valid points. Maybe I needed to reevaluate but go no lower than 8. For posterity, I re-watched some of the older Jane Eyre movies to regain some perspective. So here is my final rating – solid 9.The only reason this movie will not get a 10 is due to its length – not too long, but too short. Jane Eyre is indeed missing some material which would enrich story and character development. In hind sight I knew this during my first viewing because I wanted more of this movie and craved more interaction between Jane and Rochester. Biggest mistake of this movie was not being a miniseries or at least 3 hrs. long – HUGE Mistake. This would have been devastatingly good on a cable network as a miniseries with a little skinI am lighting a candle to mourn the loss.The chemistry between Fassbender and Mia was great! Or maybe Fassbender had enough charisma to set his own bedroom on fire. Best Rochester to date – dark and brooding, satirical and a little menacing. Great voice. Mia had restraint and vulnerability, such a treat. Judi Dench was her usual awesome self.Compared to prior versions, I prefer this movie's set decorations and atmosphere which lends itself the closest to Gothic. Costumes/dress are quite good and not overly dandy, just handsome. Ending – somewhat abrupt; another couple minutes would have been better. Do not miss this movie That's how she charmed my English gold out of my English pocket",Jane Eyre
71,markdroulston,Excellent retelling of well trodden ground,8,16 September 2011,"Adapting a classic work of literature can be a risky prospect for any filmmaker, particularly when said work is as familiar and oft told as Jane Eyre (which, leaving aside the novel, has been filmed an astonishing twenty-one times according to IMDb). The question must be asked whether or not a new version is ever going to be necessary, for surely every aspect of the story has been explored on the screen already. Director Cary Fukunaga wisely chooses to play it fairly straight with this latest version of Jane Eyre, and what results is a moody and atmospheric film that hits all the right notes of the classic tale.For a novel to be adapted repeatedly as Jane Eyre has speaks volumes about the quality of the source material, and as such it's probably unnecessary to delve into the story too much here. What Fukunaga brings to her version of the story however is a focus on certain themes in the novel, most notably that of deceit. The story is a very dark one, perhaps the best representation of Gothic literature ever created, and the notion of deceit looms over the narrative like the ever-present clouds over Thornfield Hall. Accused of deception at an early age by her benefactor, the villainous Mrs. Reed (Sally Hawkins), in fact Jane (Mia Wasikowska) herself appears to be the only pure and honest character in the story. However, though not in any way malicious, her life remains one of deception out of self-preservation. Wasikowska's Jane is every bit the plain and solitary young girl of Charlotte Bronte's novel, and her the mask she wears is of a person who wishes for nothing more than to blend into the background, not just at Thornfield, but in the world as a whole. There are rare occasions when she does voice her desire for more out of her existence than a life of servitude, but in the absence of any interior narration and without the luxury of the novel's pseudo- autobiographical, almost diary style, it's difficult to read Jane and understand her true nature. Only when she meets Rochester (Michael Fassbender), a man who sees through her deception to the passionate and ambitious core of her being, does Fukunaga expose the real Jane, and it's in these scenes that the film shines. Bronte's wonderful verbal sparring between Jane and Rochester remains intact, with many lines of dialogue lifted from the novel in their entirety, and the love between them blossoms from the novelty of each having an intellectual and moral equal.Casting Wasikowska and Fassbender was an excellent choice on the part of Fukunaga, yet the rest of the cast also excel in the supporting roles. Most surprising is Jamie Bell as St. John Rivers, breaking away from his typical youth characters and showing real growth as a performer. Rivers functions as an almost polar opposite to Rochester, and Bell plays him as ineffectual and emotionless, precisely what Jane doesn't wish to become herself. When the moment comes for Jane to finally stand up to Rivers and choose between what she desires and what is 'proper', Bell delivers some of his finest work.There are no doubt still going to be many people to debate whether audiences need another version of Jane Eyre, and obviously in a two-hour film there are going to be aspects of the novel deemed important by some that had to be left out. There is worth to the film though, and for people in search of a classic story told with genuinely suspenseful atmosphere fuelled by terrific performances, Jane Eyre more than fits the bill.tinribs27.wordpress.com",Jane Eyre
72,con_au,"For an Eyre-virgin, this was perfect",9,4 June 2019,"I've not read Jane Eyre nor have I seen any of the other adaptations, so I came to this film without the benefit/burden of preconceptions.
I actually put this film on because I had insomnia and thought it might help me sleep. About 20 minutes in I knew it'd be a late night.
I adored the stillness of the composition and the interpretations of the lead actors. The landscapes, the interiors, the quiet score, the reservation of the adult Eyre - everything evoked isolation and containment, with just a dash of mistrust thrown in.
My only tiny gripe was that the relationship development between Jane and Rochester seemed pretty thinly drawn. But when they needed to hit those big, gothic moments of romance, they really landed.
Honestly, I don't care that this screenplay didn't adhere faithfully to the novel. And I certainly didn't care that Fassbender as Rochester wasn't ugly enough. I thought this was a charming, witty, romantic and powerful story interpreted by a director and cast who were completely commitment to showcasing a passion developed between two strange and isolated people.
I guess it's not everyone's cup of tea but from someone who is oblivious to any points of comparison, I thought it was great.",Jane Eyre
73,ridiculonius,"Beautiful, but ultimately lacking",6,14 July 2012,"Though this most recent interpretation of the classic novel is wonderfully acted and beautifully shot, the romance is lacklustre and, as an adaptation, it falls painfully short. Let me begin with the trailer; I was put off of seeing this film for a while because of it. Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"" is one of my favourite books, and far and away my favourite romance. Yes, it's primarily a love story, but you wouldn't know that by watching the trailer, which paints it as more of a Gothic pseudo-supernatural mystery with a romantic subplot. Though I know that footage used in trailers can be/is heavily manipulated, I feared that the ""bold new vision"" that the film boasted meant syphoning focus off of Jane and Rochester's relationship and placing it on the so-called ""dark secrets"" of Thornfield Hall and it's master.I finally saw the film regardless, and though it can hardly be said that the ""secrets"" were given a disproportionate amount of screen time, the romance wasn't built up that much, either. Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender have decent chemistry as Jane and Rochester, but they only share a few brief scenes together before we are asked to believe that Jane loves him. There is nothing particularly wrong with these scenes, but they lack real substance. They establish a connection between the leads but this connection does not appear to go beyond a platonic curiosity about each other's character. However, mere moments after the last (read: third) of these scenes, when Jane rescues a sleeping Rochester from a fire that started in his bedroom, we are treated to a very intimate, sexually charged interlude between the two in which Rochester thanks her for her help. The sudden tension between them is jarring after their previous interactions, which seemed to indicate that their relationship was going to undergo a more gradual, natural evolution. Throughout the remainder of the second act, we are told rather than shown that Jane and Rochester have become very close friends, and that Jane is utterly devoted to him - after the scene with the fire, the film seems to consider their romance successfully established and their interactions do little more than move the plot forward/restate again and again that they are close. The film also jumps around the story's time-line a LOT. It begins with Jane leaving Thornfield and being rescued from a storm by St. John Rivers and his sisters (something which doesn't actually happen until very late in the plot). Then it flashes back to Jane's childhood (entirely removing the characters of Bessy and Miss Temple, I might add), and cuts between the St. John scenes and the distant past until, finally, we flash-back to Jane, who has suddenly aged several years, leaving Lowood School for Thornfield Hall, with absolutely no explanation as to where she is going and why (until she gets there, of course). We then follow her exploits at Thornfield without interruption; St. John and his sisters do not appear again for about an hour. Though it is interesting to see the film begun at a different point in time, the way it is executed feels sloppy. People who aren't familiar with the story might feel a little disoriented as a result. There were many things in the film that, I found, did more harm than good. For example, the exclusion of St. John's love interest (a girl from town for whom he feels he isn't good enough despite the fact that she clearly reciprocates his feelings) turns what was originally a frustrating but ultimately kinda sad character into a complete jerk. The ending is abrupt and passionless. The pacing is... hard to judge. On the one hand, the film flows pretty smoothly aside from all the time skips - but on the other hand, the time skips coupled with the many cuts make for a choppy adaptation. For anyone who knows the novel or has seen a more faithful adaptation, it is very jarring when many of the key scenes appear because of how little build-up is given too many plot-points. Aside from the abruptness of Jane/Rochester's romance, there is also the all-but-cut character of Grace Poole, who is integral to the ""dark secrets"" subplot, the aforementioned removal of St. John's love interest, and ignoring the fact that Jane and the Rivers' are actually cousins. Regarding the actors, everyone does a very good job, particularly Mia Wasikowska as Jane, who pulls off the ""plain"" look despite being very beautiful, and who does a fantastic job capturing Jane's personality. Michael Fassbender and Jamie Bell (who plays St. John) do good work with their characters but physically are awfully miscast. Rochester is supposed to be unattractive, at least in a conventional way - Michael Fassbender on the other hand is dead sexy. (ROCHESTER: Do you find me handsome? JANE: No, sir. ME: ... Do you have eyes, woman?) On the other hand you have Jamie Bell as St. John, who is supposed to be conventionally handsome but... is played by Jamie Bell. NOT to say that Bell isn't attractive (he most certainly is), but he isn't quite PRETTY enough to play St. John. I know it sounds like I'm being hard on the film, but I really did enjoy it and for what it's worth it's a solid flick. However, I think that it did fall short on many counts. Film adaptations of ""Jane Eyre"" are hard to do. Not due to any real faults in the story, but simply because a lot happens, and all of it has relevance. Despite the fact that this most recent adaptation is a full 2 hours long, a lot has been cut and it shows. After seeing this film, I've come to the sad conclusion that, for ""Jane Eyre"" adaptations at any rate, the mini-series format is the way to go, unless the director is willing to let the film's runtime exceed the 2 hour mark.",Jane Eyre
74,aernest,"Oh, look, another one!",7,25 April 2011,"I believe I've seen EVERY version of Jane Eyre, and I never get tired of the story. I can get tired of incompetent productions, but fortunately, that wasn't TOO much the case here. First off, this film looks great. It's appropriately, but not oppressively, gloomy. There is even an occasional blue sky! Thornfield looks majestic, as does Lowood School. Speaking of Lowood, Helen Burns was rather nicely played in this version. I WISH some production would show what happened at Lowood after Helen's death, but not many do. Which leads us to our Jane - Mia Wachowski. She's not bad, really. As others have pointed out, she's too pretty, but almost all the versions make that mistake. One of the great joys of this story is the gradually growing interplay and subtle intellectual sniping between Jane and Rochester. This movie is able to capture some of that, thankfully. Michael Fassbinder? Well, he's not the worst Rochester I've seen, but he's certainly not the best either. I would rank him in the top 5. He has the necessary charm, but he just doesn't seem QUITE broken-hearted enough over Bertha. I couldn't really believe he would try to save her. And then there's Judi Dench as Mrs. Fairfax. She's rather a big gun for what is usually a minor role, but she does fine in the definitely beefed-up part. DID she know Bertha was in the house? This version says a specific ""No,"" when it's left rather up in the air in the book. St. John Rivers is presented more sympathetically than usual in this version, as are his sisters. I was REALLY thinking this version might reveal that they and Jane ARE relatives, but it didn't. Biggest problems with this version? It seemed a bit long - I was ready for it to be over about a half-hour before it was. And OHMYGOSH - Jane does NOT say ""Reader, I married him."" Nor does she reveal that Rochester at least partially regains his sight. Rochester's face is curiously unscarred for someone who had a flaming timber fall across it, too.",Jane Eyre
75,l_r_26,"Not my cup of tea , kinda boring, but a good movie. You just have to be in some sort of a ""granny"" - patient, nothing too exciting mood when you watch it.",7,8 December 2014,"I could rate it a 6 but gave it a 7. This movie started kinda OK. It was enjoyable and well made. Then, after a while I honestly got bored. This movie went a bit too slowly. It wasn't ""juicy"" enough, it didn't flow as well as I would have liked either. The side stories of young Jane and of Jane at St. John's house, weren't woven into the main story well enough. But they were interesting stories. The vibe of the movie also isn't something after my own heart, but I can see how female (and male) romantic and ""scholary"" audience might enjoy this much more than I did. The last part of the movie (40 minutes or so) was twice as good as the rest of the movie! Ultimately the last scene was very beautiful and memorable! So, overall I have to say a good quality movie, but not one of the great ones on my list. Real rating: 7.5MY RATING SYSTEM:9.4 - 10 = rating 10 ***** 8.8 - 9.3 = rating 9 ***** 8.2 - 8.7 = rating 8 ***** 7.5 - 8.1 = rating 76.7 - 7.4 = 6 6.0 - 6.6 = 5 5.0 - 5.9 = 4 4.0 - 4.9 = 3 3.0 - 3.9 = 2 1.0 - 2.9 = 1",Jane Eyre
76,marspeach,Needs a director's cut,6,23 July 2013,"I had very high hopes for this film, despite thinking it was too soon for another adaptation. I mean, the 2006 BBC miniseries was released less than five years before this one! As much as I love Jane Eyre, I do think think there's such a thing as adaptation overload. I can't help but feel that they could have adapted another work instead.Overall, my view on the film is that it is a disappointment. It could have been great but it did not meet my expectations. One of my main problems was the structure. The film starts out with Jane fleeing Thornfield and being found by the Rivers. Any scenes from before that point are flashbacks, occasionally coming back to a scene in the ""present"" at Moor House. I remember reading about this choice before the film came out and being hesitant, but I thought it might come out better than I expected. Unfortunately, it did not. The flashback structure was confusing for my friends who did not read the book. To me, it was just an annoyance. I get that they were trying to do something different, but it just didn't work for me in practice. I think that the film could have benefited from about 10-20 extra minutes of run-time. A lot of the explanations and backstories are cut out. What really bothered me about this is that it looked like more things were actually originally filmed, but left on the cutting room floor. The DVD confirmed my suspicions on some of this- plenty of deleted scenes on it should have been left in the film, IMO! I do not know why some of them were cut. Because I saw the film with several people who did not read the book, I know that a lot of it was confusing. And for me, even though I knew the backstory, I was just irritated not to see it! One major thing I felt they should have done with extra time would be to show more buildup to Jane and Rochester's relationship. Some of their scenes together are great, but they needed more of these before they actually got engaged to show and explain their growing attraction more.As to the actors, I found much of the acting to be understated. In some cases I liked this approach more than in others. Mia Wasikowska is not plain, but I thought they made her look the part well enough in terms of age and stature. I found her acting, however, to be underwhelming. I thought her performance was too restrained. In the proposal scene, in particular, I thought she held back too much. I don't want Jane to be over the top, but I wanted a little more passion. A lot of focus in this version seemed to be put on Jane wanting freedom and developing into a woman, but I could have done without the scene of her examining the painting of a naked lady. Not that I had any issues with the picture, but the scene accomplished nothing (that time could have been better spent elsewhere) and this ""nude image"" was part of the reason the film got a PG-13 rating. While Michael Fassbender was also a bit more restrained than some other actors (especially compared to Timothy Dalton, my favorite), I liked his performance more than Mia's. The two did have good chemistry, but there just weren't enough scenes to show them falling in love. Bertha, I felt to have not enough of a presence. Grace Poole was really just in the background and so there was never any of Jane suspecting her. Bertha herself was not as menacing as she could have been. I suppose they did not want to be offensive but she just wasn't scary enough. The Rivers siblings were all good in their roles, but I was not a fan of the change made to their relationship with Jane. I don't want to make it seem like I completely hated this film, because I didn't. I thought that the scenes of Jane's childhood were particularly well-done, especially given the short time-frame. Many individual scenes were great. On the whole, I just found it to be slightly lacking. I want a director's cut!",Jane Eyre
77,tpkrause1,So many things right!,7,6 October 2018,"""Faithful"" adaptations can't be the goal or they'd all go on forever. And why adapt a book if it doesn't reimagine the book in some way? To be blunt about it, if you want the book, just read the book. I think adaptations into a new medium must be re-interpreted for that medium. Why turn this classic into a film? What themes remain relevant, and how can a film adaptation contribute to the original narrative? Can the original narrative be a vessel for new artistic expression?My initial reaction is that direction, dramaturgy, and performance combine to adapt the book beautifully. All of these elements were meticulously envisioned and executed. Changes to the storyline included reimagining everything into realism, omitting most fantastic or outlandish plots (Rochester as gypsy, laughter in the hallways, and telepathic communication - although they hinted at the latter); and narrowing focus to the most central relationship between Rochester and Jane. The climactic moment of devastation worked as well as a film could manage, in my opinion. Without the book's deep account of all of Jane's limited relationships in life, the devastation of her losing love lacks context. Furthermore, things do feel rushed, which makes me think that things shouldn't have been added; instead, maybe more should have been cut. We could have spent more time, for example, justifying Rochester's Proposal and on the uncomfortable moments leading to the wedding; and, as much as I loved Judy Dench and her performance, we could have lost a bit there (I don't remember that character having such a big role.) Things were missed, but you can't keep everything.Books can obviously not be replaced, so I'd urge fans of the movie to pick it up. Fans of the book must always let go of an an adaptation being faithful, or being the same experience you had reading, and must instead watch the film with curiosity for the artistic choices. In my opinion, the choices used in making this film were masterful, combining to capture the book's unusual combination of rich emotion.",Jane Eyre

I think Wasikowska is the main reason for the great depth and beauty here, and I also love the music. The other actors do very well too. And of course, Bronté´s writing, I don´t know how, but the story is so rich. I think it just has spirit, and this movie manages to convey it. Wow.",Jane Eyre

80,rawvibes,Governess,8,17 March 2011,"A lot of stuff has been done with this title but I like this one the best. The pace is not slow but not fast either and the corky one liners of humor makes this movie a comfortable and entertaining film to enjoy. Jane Eyre was hated by her aunt and was sent to a very strict boarding school, where a ""time out"" just means its a break from the teacher not to discipline you again. After leaving the school Jane (Mia Wasikowska) was employed at Thornfield Hall as a governess by a Mr Rochester (Michael Fassbender). While employed, a strong love yearning for one another begins to grow between Jane and Rochester. A secret of Rochester may rip them apart, leaving Jane the only love she has ever known. 4 stars out of 5 I review a movie on the Entertainment Experience.

81,orinocowomble,Captures the Essence of Charlotte Bronte's Novel,10,11 March 2014,"I have read Jane Eyre many, many times and was stunned to see the images from my own mind projected on screen. I've never been to Yorkshire, but the director captures the essence of the story as I myself have mentally lived it time and time again. It was unusual to have the narration begin in the middle of the book, but it works. The story is told in a masterly fashion, without unnecessary emphasis on the ""Gothic horror"" aspect so beloved of many filmmakers. Mrs Rochester gets about a minute of screen- time, because in this version her hidden presence is not the point. This is a film about Jane herself, about how she goes from unwanted orphan to governess to ""freeborn independent human being"" who learns to make her own way in the world. Having seen several screen adaptations of this novel, I can inequivocally say this is, in my opinion, the best of the lot. No facile emotionalism, no cheap effects--just excellent cinematography. I was struck again and again by the attention to detail that made the film a well-crafted jewel that will bear watching again and again. There's even a closeup of Jane in her simple grey dress and tucker, looking much like the famous Richmond portrait of Charlotte Bronte. The director and scriptwriter have done a sterling job in selecting the truly important plot points, events and dialogue from the novel to bring it alive for the viewer. One of the few films that will not disappoint fans of the original book, and will make the book attractive for those who haven't read it yet.",Jane Eyre

84,jacqueestorozynski,Jane Eyre doesn't quite come off,5,11 January 2014,"I have seen many versions of this story, my favourites being the Timothy Dalton TV adaptation and Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine. I was looking forward to this film but I was disappointed. There was far too much mooning about instead of getting on with the story. Characters were missing all together and as too much time was spent wandering around, the important scenes were compressed to such a degree the narrative moved along too quickly. At the end Michael Fassbinder looked remarkably unscathed for a man who had been in the flames and was now blind.The attraction for Rochester was that this pure young girl had an independent spirit, yet every time this Jane was with him she appeared to be struck dumb. Although there were lovely scenes of Thornfield Hall and the moors this film didn't come off. What Victorian young lady would be out in her nightie talking to her employer whether she loved him or not. Also Mrs Fairfax seeing Jane Rochester canoodling would have been more shocked than concerned but Dame Judy was doing her usual twinkly, kindly lady act. Indeed fires in beds, noises in the night, men being stabbed didn't faze Jane at all, she just walked around as though she was sleepwalking. This version did not appeal to me.",Jane Eyre

86,dallas_viewer,"JE aficionados, keep your expectations low and you won't be disappointed",5,5 April 2011,"A lover of Charlotte Bronte's novel, I did not care for this movie version of Jane Eyre. Perhaps for someone who has never read the book, the movie works, but I thought the screenplay was seriously lacking (and strangely slow paced, given how much of the story was left out). For my money, Moira Buffini, who wrote the screenplay, just didn't seem able to properly portray the development of Jane/Rochester's relationship, especially given the 2-hour time constraint. In fact, I was left wondering whether Buffini had thoroughly read (or attempted to understand) the novel or if she just based her hit-or-miss screenplay on some Cliff Notes version. I think it's safe to assume that some of the blame also lies with Cary Fukunaga's direction of his actors. For all I know, maybe the resulting movie was largely his own vision of ""Jane Eyre the Movie"", rather than Buffini's. Central to the story is the evolving relationship between Jane and Edward Rochester. However, in this version, the viewer is expected to ""get"" that Jane and Edward are falling for each other based on a few spotty scenes or bits of dialog, with much of the book's context missing. I found myself having to mentally fill in way too many blanks. I think that an extra 20 minutes would have been perfect to flesh out the Jane/Rochester dialog and to allow for the addition of a scene or two where we could see why these two people become attracted to each other. (For example, how about a 1-to-2-minute montage of scenes of Rochester waxing eloquent about his exotic travels and the interesting people he's met, with Jane listening raptly?) The ending needed to be expanded an extra 5 or so minutes as well. That's one of the most delicious parts of the story, and I didn't care to see it all sewn up in 60 seconds. Michael Fassbinder was a pleasant surprise. He might be a little better looking than Rochester ought to be, but I could see early on that he had the chops to pull off what could have been the best Rochester yet (well, in a better-written film). I liked that he seemed willing to show us the really not-so-likable side of Rochester, and those mercurial moods we see in the book. Mia Wasikowska's abilities I'm not too sure about (although I did think she had an acceptably young and plain look about her, unlike Ruth Wilson, whose un-Janian-like looks ruined the 2006 version for me). I thought that Mia largely failed to convey, with her unchanging, serious expression, all the turmoil that Jane is experiencing inwardly as her relationship with Rochester develops. Since we don't have benefit of a narrator in the movie, as we do in the book, we rely on the actor to tell or show us what's going on inside. I don't think Mia did an effective job of this. I found the main characters' chemistry spotty at best. I'm blaming most of this on the screenplay as well. And here's why: During the post-wedding scene--where Rochester pleads his case-- both actors demonstrated that they *could* have chemistry together-- nice chemistry--and *could* convey all the passion I had been expecting, but not seeing, elsewhere in the movie. But this chemistry only appeared for me when the dialog and the scene were fleshed out enough to clearly show the actors the way, as in the above-mentioned instance. I felt like Mia particularly did not connect with the character of Jane, without benefit of sufficient dialog, context, and direction. Again, I felt that the screenplay (and maybe direction) simply let the actors down more often than not; they simply did not have enough to ""hang their hats on,"" so to speak. The one thing this version of JE really did have going for it (IMO) was the wonderful cinematography, costumes, and sets.",Jane Eyre

Top marks to all cast members and a bonus point for the divine Judi Dench (I have been a fan of hers since seeing her at Stratford in about 1970).

I finally saw it today at the threatre and it was wonderful! Excellent. This is the best film version of ""Jane Eyre"" yet (and I've seen most of them.) This is hands-down the best CASTING for ""Jane Eyre"" yet. I have never seen a more perfect Jane Eyre, Edward Rochester, or Mrs. Fairfax. Period. Jane brought tears to my eyes so many, many times in this film. She was simply perfect. Small, soft-spoken, young, composed, graceful, dignified, and lovely in her uniquely plain way. And Edward Rochester? Wow --what a ruggedly handsome man! He was certainly not ""pretty-boy handsome""; but rugged, masculine, with sharp features, a deep voice, and a sometimes abrupt and harsh manner. He was exactly as described in ""Jane Eyre!"" BRAVO to you both, Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska!In my opinion, Fassbender and Wasikowska have finally given us perfect embodiments of all we adored in them.... Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester--two of the most beloved fictional characters of all time. Brilliant performances, really. I am truly delighted.The sets, costumes, lighting, art, mood, cinematography, and score were all excellent. I hope the Academy Award is awake and paying attention!Loving the novel as I do, I found a few flaws I must mention: I didn't think Blanche was nearly pretty enough; Bertha was not frightening enough; Rochester's kindnesses to Jane were not displayed here (an audience member might wonder why she loved him as she did); St. John Rivers was a much harsher character here --not gentle and lovable as he was in the book; and lastly, the film was less than two hours long and therefore too much was left out of the story. I fervently wish it could have been 20 or 30 minutes longer. Another 20 or 30 minutes might have helped the audience understand even better Jane's desolate past, her fierce love for Rochester, and her bright future.That may sound like a lot of criticism, but you must consider what a masterpiece the novel ""Jane Eyre"" is. The novel is often considered ahead of its time due to its masterful portrayal of the development of a thinking and passionate young woman who is individualistic, desiring for a full life, while also highly moral.Overall, I highly recommend the film. It was artfully told. I cried; I gasped; I laughed; I flinched; and I cried some more. I know I'll enjoy watching it again and again.THANK YOU to the actors, director, and everyone involved in bringing this film to its fruition. Hopefully, it will prompt new generations of fans to read the novel and fall in love with Jane Eyre, as so many of us have since it was published in 1847.This film is beautiful, romantic, frightening, sometimes funny, and ultimately very moving.

89,reeseslightning,How can a fan of the book say this is the best?,6,5 August 2011,"First off, I'm a huge fan of the book. I think it may be one of the most underrated books of all time.Now for the movie.Let's get to the good: 1) The casting- Michael Fassbender is perhaps the hottest Rochester I could ever imagine. He's got the ""ugly"" that the character needs while not bothering to try and hide his good looks. He brings a certain something to the character that wasn't in the books.Mia...whatever her last name was okay. She's young so at least they kept that in the movie. But she's quiet and meek which is what Jane is really like.But there is zero chemistry between them. And what there is, is forced.2) The music- absolutely wonderful!! 3) The scenery- Gorgeous! Just the Thornfield I had imagined in my head come to life.Now for the bad: 1) Pacing- The movie went by way to fast. It missed the whole buildup and friendship between Jane and Rochester so when it came to for them to declare their love, it was a WTF moment.2) Lack of important parts- the whole book is focused on Jane's lack of family. Then, we find out that the Rivers family is actually her family as well.The movie completely ignored this! And they made John into an admirer of Jane! WTF? Jane's background is barely touched on. Where is her friendship with Helen? And what about Lowood and the Reed girls? 3) Timing- Again, it was rushed. But the timing of the story is all over the place. I didn't mind that they told it as a backstory, but it was kind of distracting.I've seen the deleted scenes and I think that if they were included, the story would've flowed smoother and made much more sense. And really, was it that hard to include a few extra scenes that are important (such as Adele and Rochester's connection)? Those scenes would've made the movie maybe 10-12 minutes longer, which the movie desperately could've used.4) The Ending- Um...what? I thought I was watching Jane Eyre and not Pride and Prejudice. There was an epilogue at the end of the book which shows what happened to Rochester and Jane. Instead, the writers went for a Jane Austen ala P&P sequence that slowly fades out with them.Boring and anti climatic to a very predictable movie based on a very harsh and real love story.How can a true fan of the book say this is great? They leave out just about everything important! (ie. Bertha, Adele/Rochester connection, the Reeds, the Rivers, Lowood, Bessie, and so much more) However, if you never read the book, then its great. Usually I have no problem separating book from film, but this was ridiculous. They filmed most of those parts that I mentioned then deleted them. What a waste.",Jane Eyre

Some of the cinematography is quite literally breath-taking and Adriano Goldman has produced something of real beauty in shot after shot. Most of the night time shooting appears to have been done entirely with candlelight which adds to the powerful build up of atmosphere and tension at Rochester's house.The direction is assured and the acting of Mia Wasilokowska as Jane and Michael Fassbender as the mysterious and irascible Rochester holds the centre ground of this believable love story. Charlotte Brontë wrote a wonderful book with a heroine that is far from too good to be true, but is a young woman whose humanity is central to the whole purpose of the book. Mia captures both her strength and her depth through very understated acting.The torment that faces Rochester is gradually revealed – and the mystery of his household will not be revealed in this review. Fassbender manages to be both frightening and attractive; quite an achievement. They are surrounded by excellent actors like Judi Dench as the housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax and Sally Hawkins as the deeply unpleasant Mrs. Reed.When a film is a perfect example of its genre it deserves 10 in my view. This is and does.",Jane Eyre
91,jamesmartin1995,One of English literature's best-loved heroines is back on the big screen.,7,21 April 2012,"Cary Fukunaga is an interesting new talent. 'Jane Eyre' is his second major work, seemingly a distinct contrast to his first: the impressive 'Sin Nombre'. Both, I suppose, are about outsiders, entering worlds they know nothing about, and trying desperately to keep their heads above water. But thematically, the similarities are so broad and vague that you would be forgiven for thinking that the two films are completely incompatible in any way: after all, one is about illegal immigration; the other, at its heart, is a love story!And what a love story it is. Charlotte Bronte's novel has been adapted countless times for television and cinema; yet the most obvious thing about this version is that 'Jane Eyre' has never looked better on the silver screen. If there is one thing that we can pat ourselves on the back for, it is that we can produce the most gorgeous cinematography. This is not only in the context of a beautiful sunset, or radiant summer blossoms, but in shadows, and mist, and fog; the grey, murky winter light filtering through a window pane onto the wan, melancholy complexion of our heroine. Much of the film takes place in shadows and in darkness, where a flickering candle produces the only light, playing on the terrified gaze of the onlooker, as unseen spectres creep about the corridors; yet Thornfield Hall will metamorphose from an oppressive, disquieting castle (not unlike those of Gothic horror) to a place of joy and happiness during the film. But perhaps these are only illusionary qualities Its final transformation may show it for what it always was. All of this said, there are niggling problems with the editing and the cinematography. For example, in the novel (and every adaptation I've seen), Jane's first journey to Thornfield Hall is laced with menace and foreboding (add some wolves and a supernatural ring of fire and we have Bram Stoker's Dracula all over again). Yet Jane's arrival here is rushed and clumsy. Of course, the film was inevitably going to be a condensed version of the novel – not every scene that Bronte penned could possibly make it into a 2 hour film, but certainly during the first half hour, dealing with Jane's childhood and adolescence, it can seem a little rushed.The plot is well known, so I won't bother with the details: if you are unaware of it, so much the better. Watch it without knowing the intricacies of the plot and the iconic twist. Fukunaga is clever in the way in which he holds a great reverence for his source material without falling into the trap of following it blindly. He can pick and choose, and put his own stamp on it. Atmosphere is everything, and his adaptation has it in spades. The film begins and ends differently from the novel: Fukunaga starts in the middle, observing a distraught Jane Eyre fleeing from Thornfield, and ends just a little before the novel does (the final scene is inspired). Some have complained about the film being restrained, the implication being that Fukunaga toes the line between his adaptation being shrewdly concentrated and coldly desiccated. I'm perfectly happy to say that if that's the case, Fukunaga stays firmly on the right side of that line.Of course, I could go on about the lavish sets and production values, but it is, in the end, Mia Wasikowska that makes the film a success. What a vision she is as Jane Eyre, humble and vulnerable, but strong, determined and just – Bronte's perfect heroine, and one of the great leading ladies of feminist literature. Michael Fassbender makes an adequate Rochester, but it is Mia who is the discovery here; from Tim Burton's somewhat lacklustre adaptation of 'Alice in Wonderland', she has now, with 'Jane Eyre', cemented her status as one of the most exciting new actresses in contemporary cinema. The supporting cast is equally as impressive: Judi Dench (always reliable) plays Mrs. Fairfax, Jamie Bell is the preacher that Jane will meet a little later in the story (or, in this version, right at the beginning), and Sally Hawkins has a cameo as the young Jane's rotten guardian, Mrs. Reed.All things considered, this is a strong, solid adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's Gothic romance. I, for one, can't wait for the new version of Emily's 'Wuthering Heights' to be released later this year!",Jane Eyre
92,Autonome,"Anxious, haunting world of Bronte",8,12 April 2011,"Jane Eyre illustrates what men don't get about women. The definitive screen adaptation? A most psychologically romantic movie to take a woman to. Stunningly filmed in northern England, dramatically immersed in the desolation of Bronte's settings. Steeped in haunting, subtle imagery punctuated by Bronte's arresting dialog. Her eloquence adeptly slices through both the chasm of years since she penned them, and modern male preconceptions of romance.The director's diverse heritage lends him a wide range of film and literature to draw on. Perhaps he emphasized surprising similarities to Japanese legends.",Jane Eyre
93,vgs1895,Very disappointed,4,16 September 2011,"I love Jane Eyre and have seen all of the English-speaking versions of it, I think. So, we watched the 2011 one. It got excellent reviews here except for a few who felt the way I did. These are my opinions, and I totally respect the opinions of those who loved this version. Pros:--Jane looked good. Very plain.--Scenery was good.--Many of the lines were directly from the book.--Adele is played by a petite young girl (as opposed to the Ciaran Hinds version where Adele is almost taller than Jane).Cons:--Boring. It was my husband's first exposure to Jane Eyre, and probably his last. He was bored, and he usually likes British stuff, even Jane Austin or Bronte. He won't watch that genre more than one time, but at least he'll watch it that one time. In this case, he had a problem keeping up with this particular movie. (See my next comment.)--In the beginning, they go back and forth between her childhood and present day. For him, that was confusing--and it would have been for me as well if I didn't know the story backwards and forwards.--Rochester isn't ""ugly"" enough (Ciaran Hinds was perfect for it, Timothy Dalton wasn't -- even though his version is one of my favorites). That's not a major issue, but I don't think he was suitable for this movie. (I love Ciaran Hinds' looks, by the way, so I'm not knocking him!) --Not good character development. I don't know how it's possible, but they really didn't develop the characters well. We didn't know or care about St. John or his sisters. The most 'thorough' J.E. is the Timothy Dalton one, and it's very long. But even the shorter ones still are able to develop characters. This one didn't. I found it almost a chore to watch. I didn't care all about Rochester and Jane.--They didn't include some key lines between Rochester and Jane which would have really helped show that Jane was strong.Ironically, I watched the deleted scenes, and probably half of them would have made the movie better.",Jane Eyre
94,love_for_nails,Very beautiful.,9,14 September 2012,"A very beautiful and moving production. Well, maybe not as moving as The Duchess, which in my opinion was the most heartbreaking movie I ever watched, but I think that as a period movie is definitely beautiful. I haven't had the chance to read the book, but my mother did and she loved the film. So I guess it captures the essential idea. Mia Wasikowska is a new appearance for me. Although I've seen Alice in Wonderland, these are the only movies with her so far that I have seen. She does a very good job, she is a very good actress in my opinion, at least she didn't disappoint me until now. Michael Fassbender did a great portrayal also, he delivered his character with talent. I loved the performance of Judi Dench also. All of them were wonderful.All in all it was a great movie, well directed, a good screenplay, that captured the story perfectly, and of course with talented actors.Definitely worth watching.",Jane Eyre
95,LovePythons,A dark and glossy snorefest,6,27 September 2011,"I rented this because of all the rave reviews. They were highly exaggerated. Is the film beautiful? I suppose so, what you can see in the gloomy sets, whole rooms lit only by a small fire. Is Jane enchanting? Mia W, is so sedate, sitting ramrod straight and never raising her voice even a half tone, that I found it difficult to believe Mr. Rochester had been o'erthrown with love.And what about Mr. R? He was textbook handsome, not craggy and tortured. He so obviously had a Good Heart beneath the sulks and tantrums, that he was nothing (and Jane agreed) to be the least afraid of.How about Judy Densch as the housekeeper? Agreeable but a waste of talent. The young Adele? Adnoidal but adequate.What had me giving up fairly early in the film was the glacial pacing. It's a slow moving story in essence but to drag it out with wooden performances in the dark was just too much for me. I love the book and other adaptations. Even if this were the first film version I ever saw, I think I would have thrown in the towel out of boredom.",Jane Eyre
96,psychoameise,Sigh...,4,3 May 2012,"I had been looking forward to seeing this adaptation for ages. I missed it when it was in the theatres and then had to wait for months and months before it came out on DVD. I love the book and I ADORE Michael Fassbender and was absolutely confident he'd be the ultimate Rochester and the movie a delight. I so desperately wanted to love this that I would have forgiven a lot. I've just finished watching it and I'm gutted.The movie starts after Jane has run away from Thornfield and the story till then is told in flashbacks, which I don't care for but they kind of pulled it off. It was distracting but not my major complaint. My major complaint is the total lack of development in the relationship between the two leads (which kind of is the do or die of any romance, isn't it?). Jane and Rochester don't get any time to fall in love, they maybe have five scenes together before they get engaged. Fassbenders Rochester is mostly gruff and rude to begin with and there is no earthly reason why Jane should like him. But I was willing to wait and confident they would still develop the chemistry. But then suddenly the fire scene happens and Rochester goes all sexy and tries to kiss Jane. WTF? It was completely illogical because nothing had happened before that scene to indicate there were feelings between the two and then suddenly they pile on the sexual tension? It felt extremely forced. Rochester hadn't so much as smiled at Jane beforeI do not blame either Fassbender or Wasikowska for this. They are not my favourite Jane and Rochester but they do a very decent job. The after-wedding scene where Rochester begs Jane to run away with him proved to me that the two actors were capable of developing brilliant chemistry and show loads of emotion. They were let down by a bad script and bad directing. The script isn't awful but it's second rate. A lot of key scenes are missing and some are ruined. The lovely scene where Jane leaves the party and Rochester runs after her and asks her to stay for instance. At the critical moment when he approaches her with a tender look and says ""You are depressed"" and the viewer thinks ""Yes, finally a bit of chemistry"" Mrs Fairfax barges in to tell Rochester that Mason has come and ruins the scene. Unpardonable in my book. Of course, a lot of the story had to be cropped to fit the two hour schedule but the movie suffers for it. But even with this script I believe if the director had had the sense to allow Jane and Rochester a couple more scenes or allow Fassbender to smile once or twice, he might have saved it. But he didn't. The worst thing however is the ending. Jane and Rochester meet after months apart, she takes his hand, says she will stay with him, the viewer sighs and goes ""Aaawww"" and then the credits start appearing. WHAT?!?!?! I had been waiting for this moment for the entire movie and they give it all of 30 seconds?!?!?! And making Rochester look like a complete ogre was uncalled for I think, slightly dishevelled would have done...I give this movie four courtesy stars for good actors, decent cinematography and a nice try. But on the whole I would have been just as happy if I'd never seen it. Probably happier. If you absolutely must: Rent or borrow, don't buy!",Jane Eyre
97,tonya-jarrett,"Run, don't Walk to your local theatre",10,20 March 2011,"This is less a review than an impression that I've been posting at a few sites - I'm an avowed cinephile so I hope that counts for something, but for people who have not seen this film yet, I only want to give a thumbnail. Sometimes a short emotionally-infused impression is better: Oh my. I'm just back from the film and espresso afterward. Never cried so much at any film version of this story. Finally, the best-paired two actors, a writer who knew how to bring out the best of the novel, and a director to pull it all together. Somehow, Director Fukunaga found a way to make it fresh without any modernism at all, with help from Screenwriter Moira Buffini. I do not want to go into detail - I want you to discover this film for yourself. I will say, for me, they mined everything that was important and gave it beautiful expression and downplayed the melodramatic elements of Bronte's story. They simply aren't necessary. We now have a definitive version of Jane Eyre for the ages.",Jane Eyre
98,kburditt,Wonderful new Jane Eyre,9,9 March 2011,"I saw a sneak preview of Jane Eyre last night at AFI/Silver in Silver Spring MD. This is a beautifully filmed, engrossing, and haunting version of the classic Charlotte Bronte novel Jane Eyre. This film is worth seeing and it will leave you thinking about it long after you have left the theater. It captures that otherworldly and isolated environment that Jane inhabits in her lonely life. After you witness the unloved childhood and brutal boarding school you can understand how Jane can not only adapt to her isolated employment but revel in a world where the absence of abuse is a relief. One thing that struck me was the way the actress portraying Jane Eyre, Mia Wasikowska, inhabited Jane's being. The quiet stillness, the dignity, the steely nerves under the mask of composure. I have been trying to recall another actress who portrayed the physicality of a woman, a governess, in that time period so perfectly. She wasn't a modern actress in a corset, she moved like a young woman who is used to the corset and layers of cloth, and the expectations on a young woman in Victorian England. I also particularly enjoyed the portrayal of a vibrant, intelligent, woman who knows she is caged by the norms of her society and her position in it. Miss Wasikowska did a wonderful portrayal of Jane, giving her great depth while still letting the emotions flit across her usually stoic face. I also liked Mrs Reed - she is a wholly human villain, petty, cruel, insecure, and resentful. You can see her in Miss Ingram, a petty woman who could turn hateful. The young Jane is a stand out performance, all spit and fury, you realize that Jane's survival is due to her courage. That the intensity of the child is coiled inside the adult Jane. The cinematography is beautiful, the sets and costumes look accurate, the screenplay handled well, and the directing outstanding. I also appreciate that no character was over done. This film will age well, where some other versions can make you cringe now. This film is going to make me pick up the novel and read it again after a very long time. Not a bad recommendation for a movie.",Jane Eyre
99,km2442,Overall Bland,4,28 November 2011,"I am a huge fan of the Ruth Wilson/Toby Stephens version. I had high hopes for this one, but it just never really took off. The whole movie felt underwhelming. Mia's role as Jane was underperformed. There was hardly any passion or conviction in her confession of love to Rochester. I just didn't believe the two really cared about each other. It felt forced and almost like the acting was toned down on purpose. The only scene you could feel a glimmer of romance was after the fire in Rochester's bedroom, where he takes her hand. It was alright, but I expect better than an overly done try at purely poetic. It just felt forced and not well done.",Jane Eyre
100,FlixChatter,A worthy adaptation... but left me wanting more,7,28 March 2011,"The oft-filmed Charlotte Brontë's Gothic novel has been adapted into TV and film more than two dozen times. Here's a summary of what works and what doesn't in this 2011 version:THE GOOD:  Cary Fukunaga's direction. He preferred natural light for much of the film, forgoing camera lighting and instead opted for candles which created the proper dark, moody and gloomy atmosphere that matches Rochester's temperament perfectly. He used some hand-held camera work to great effect, but not too much so that it became distracting. Thornfield Hall, Rochester's expansive mansion looked like something Count Dracula could comfortably settle in. It practically becomes its own character here and adds the necessary spookiness we come to expect from this Gothic tale. Judi Dench as Mrs. Fairfax – When does Dame Judi ever disappoint? Apparently never. Even in small roles, the scenes she's in are one of the best ones in the movie. There was an important scene involving Jane and Rochester where Mrs. Fairfax didn't utter a single word, but she made quite an impact just with her expression. Mia Wasikowska as Jane. A lot of the issues I have with literary adaptation is that the supposedly plain heroine usually ends up being played actresses who are too glamorous for the role. Fortunately in this one, Wasikowska was believable as a plain young girl, though she obviously is a pretty girl. At 18, she's also the perfect age for the role. If I were to nitpick though, she's not exactly 'little' as she's described in the novel as Rochester doesn't quite tower over her. In any case, I thought she did a wonderful job carrying the film. She captures the essence of the strong-willed character who holds her own against her much older subject of her affection, and one who despite 'not being well-acquainted with men' doesn't seem intimidated by them. Michael Fassbender as Rochester. In many ways, we evaluate a Jane Eyre adaptation by its Rochester, and as long as we use that 'calculation,' I think he measures up quite well. He has a strong screen presence and is the kind of actor who's usually the best thing even in a so-so film, and he makes the most of what's given to him. Even with the relatively short screen time, which is less than what I had hoped, he's able to make us care for Rochester. THE NOT-SO-GOOD:  This cliff-notes version feels way too fast. With a complex story like this, no doubt it'd be a challenge for any filmmaker, no matter how talented, to pare it down into a two-hour movie. So it's inevitable that this film just moves along too quick for me. Of course that is not Fukunaga's fault and he really made the best of it, but still this version just leaves me wanting more. I guess this is perhaps a more 'accessible' version for the crowd that otherwise would not watch JE. But to me, the story is compelling enough that an extra half-hour would only enhance the viewing experience and allow enough time for the characters to develop an authentic connection. Dialog omission. This is perhaps a result of being 'spoiled' by the comprehensive 1983 version (which at 5.5 hours is perhaps the longest screen adaptation). Of course it's impossible to include every single dialog from the book, but I was hoping at least some of the important ones are kept. The famous quotes such as ""I am no bird; and no net ensnares me"", ""Do as I do: trust in God and yourself"", ""Reader, I married him"" are not spoken in this adaptation. I also find some of the delivery lacks bite, y'know that certain oomph that an actor does to bring those timeless words to life. Jamie Bell seems miscast. Now, keep in mind I really like Jamie as an actor and have said so many times on my blog (http://tinyurl.com/mozzs5) However, I don't feel he's right for the role of St. John Rivers. Firstly, when you've already got someone as striking as Fassbender as Rochester, I'd think the casting agent would have to find someone much fairer than he. No offense to Jamie, but that's not the case here and he certainly doesn't fit the book description of 'tall, fair with blue eyes, and with a Grecian profile.' Now, physical appearance aside, he also lack the solemn and pious sensibility of a Christian missionary. Unconventional storyline – Moira Buffini's script tells the story in flashback mode instead of following the novel's linear storyline. The movie starts off right as Jane is leaving Thornfield, which is right smack dab where the main crisis of the story begins. Now, I can understand that it's done to make it less tedious, yet it gets confusing at times to figure out which part happens in the past or present. I think for someone not familiar with the book, the shuffled time line might be a bit tough to follow.IN CONCLUSION, despite leaving the theater wanting more, I do think this is a worthy adaptation. The production quality is top notch, with gorgeous cinematography, affecting light work and music that serve the story well. There is even one scene of Jane and Rochester that Fukunaga took liberty with that's quite tantalizing. It caught me off guard but I must say that scene left me breathless and is an effective way to convey how much Jane longed for her true love.But in the end, even though I adore Fassbender, he still hasn't replaced Timothy Dalton as my favorite Rochester. Sure, the production quality of this one is superior, but what makes a Jane Eyre story so fascinating and memorable are the heart-wrenching connection between the two main protagonists and the dialog spoken between them, so in that regard, the 1983 version is still the one to beat.",Jane Eyre
101,ekenaudra,one of the best renditions so far,8,3 July 2012,"I love the tale of Jane Eyre and often watch all the remakes of it. the first one (the one with a young Elizabeth Taylor) was intriguing to see the time's interpretation of the classic story about an orphaned girl shunned by a cruel aunt (who is her sole guardian) and tossed away to a deeply religious and intolerable boarding school for young girls. She grows up and takes a job as a governess to a young ward of a mysterious and cranky man who is wealthy and owns a manor. after some time, flirtation and heart strings being pulled you see the pair fall in love and plan to make it official, but on their wedding day another mystery is let loose that the wealthy man is in fact previously married to a mentally insane woman whom his father chose for him in a prearranged marriage. so the heart broken Jane Eyre runs away from the madness and takes a position elsewhere as a teacher, when her aunt dies she finds out that she actually had a uncle that would have gladly taken her as his ward, but he was kept away from her... so on her uncle's death bed he names Jane as his beneficiary and she comes into wealth of about 3,000 dollars (which back then was a hella lot of money) so she returns to her true love to find that the manor has been burnt to ruins and her true love is marred due to the fire. (in some variations he is horribly disfigured, but in this movie he was merely blinded) anyways his insane wife is dead (died in the fire that she had started) and he is left in ruins. Jane returns to him and it is assumed that they spend the rest of their lives together.OK, so now that i have ruined the movie for all of you out there let me tell you why this one is my fave so far. 1. the stylization of this movie is better then previous versions 2. the lust driven is more passionate and much more believable in this version then in others (the plot is a misfortunate girl finding her way to happiness albeit down a quite unhappy and long road... however... the intrigue of this movie/book is the lustful dance that Jane Eyre and Mr. Fairfax have for each other. in other versions (perhaps because of that time's society) the lust was lacking... however in this movie it is there... boy is it there! :) 3. Fairfax in this movie comes across as a rude and selfish man at first (like all the rest of the adaptations) but in this movie he warms and changes to show a many different deeper layer to himself (direction? acting?) whatever the case i am happy for it because i disliked the stick up the butt rudeness of prior Fairfax portrayals. i liked that even though Jane Eyre is a shy meek and not so stunningly attractive woman she still manages to win the heart of a suitor. but i especially liked this movie's portrayal of Jane. still meek, still shy however she has more raw emotions that the actress is brimming with. and that takes you on a better emotional roller-coaster ride with the characters. oh and i love the scene where Fairfax pleads with Jane to be his wife with or without the official wedding (in other words he wants her to give herself to him in every wifely/companionship way but without it being legally binding. (which obviously she refuses)i like that Fairfax was blinded and not horribly disfigured... i feel that Jane has suffered enough to not have to take care of a lying drooling helpless man. and also it sort of seems like godly punishment towards Fairfax's deception that he eventually gets what he wants but at a cost (1. He loses his wealth, and 2. He has his Jane but only by touch, taste, smell, and hearing therefore he is unable to have her fully) however i really like the characters of Jane and Fairfax and choose to believe that they live happily ever after :)",Jane Eyre

104,LifeVsArt,An exquisite take on a timeless classic ...,10,30 May 2013,"Mia Wasikowska is brilliant as Jane Eyre - she brings soulfulness, intelligence and true pathos to the character. Michael Fassbender creates a living and breathing Rochester who is powerful, sensitive and magnetic - the two actors, together, truly create magic on-screen - I would say this is easily my favorite version of ""Jane Eyre"", by a wide margin. Without great central performances like these all would have been for nothing, but, fortunately, the actors delivered the goods, and then some (Wasikowska is truly a revelation). The film, however, has everything else going for it, too: the direction, the script, the brooding and gorgeous cinematography and a score that is one of the most memorable I've heard in some time (it accompanies and supports all the scenes perfectly and also holds up on it's own). This was such an exquisite film that I had to go back and read the novel all over again - when I did, I couldn't help but picture Mia Wasikowska, Michael Fassbender and Dame Judi Dench as the characters - I now probably always will. ""Jane Eyre"", the book, is not some musty and quaint relic from the Victorian past, it is a timeless story that deeply touches our humanity - I was thankful for this film sending me back, once again, to Charlotte Bronte's wonderful classic.",Jane Eyre

Mia is fantastic as Jane, very reserved and Michael Fassbender.... well, lets just say I have a slight crush now.I made a point of NOT reading any reviews on IMDb in case they were all bad. I was amazed at how much I loved it.

109,kcb294,Development!,8,16 June 2017,Jane Eyre was a decent movie. The acting was very good. Especially from Mia and Michael. It was very visually pleasing and the lighting was amazing in most of the movie. It took about an hour for me to actually get involved with the story and it was a rather long movie. For that reason alone did it lose points for me. A great family film. The costumes were pretty great as well.,Jane Eyre
110,Bart_OP,A Beautiful Film,8,5 April 2011,"Superb film-making. Beautiful script, exquisite acting, marvelous adaptation of a powerful story of how real human character and love transcend everything! Director, Cary Fukunaga, is really a cinematographer and it shows as the primary strength of his direction. But his direction may also account for the star quality work of Mia Wasikowski, who was wonderful last year in both Alice in Wonderland AND The Kids are Alright. She showed the appropriate restraint as Bronte's heroine and this role transcends her previous work. Michael Fassbender's Mr Rochester is superb: his movement between the mysterious and conflicted on the one hand, and tender and vulnerable on the other was quite believable. Judi Dench is, well, Judi Dench; which is to say remarkable. And that whole group of girls who said ""awwwww...."" when they heard I was going to see this movie tonight will love it - and so will their dates.",Jane Eyre
111,aajay,"Not my favorite version, but better than most",7,6 April 2011,"Well, I've seen worse but then again I've seen better. Jane Eyre is my most favorite book since I first read it at thirteen and many, many times since. Frankly, I don't know why they keep remaking it if they're not going to stay true to the book. They only end up disappointing us ""Janeites"" to whom every word and idea is known and loved and confusing the heck out of those not familiar with it. I don't know how anyone, who is not familiar with the book, made any sense out of this version. It's hard enough to shorten JE which is not only packed with complicated relationships but also, more importantly, with IDEAS while dealing with random flashbacks. And the omissions--the morning after scene MUST include Jane's wrestling with herself ""who would care"" if she lived with Mr R ""I CARE""--""Laws and principles are not for the time when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this"" These are the concepts which make up Jane's character; without them it's just another Gothic thriller. My favorite version is the 1983 mini-series in which they had time to develop the book. I'm not sure one can make a two hour movie of a long Victorian novel. And another thing, why do these movies have to be so DARK? What happened to ""suspension of disbelief""?",Jane Eyre
112,cory_j_adams,An Eerie and Beautiful Vision of Bronte's Classic,10,23 July 2011,"I have seen many reviews for this film saying that it is not true to the novel (which it is) but after seeing it for first time the I've realized that for this they only took certain parts of the novel for a reason. Though the film is not completely true to the novel, the film in it self is gorgeous. Let me start with the acting. I think that they did have some rather odd casting in this film but all in all it was very good. Mia Wasikowska definitely surprised me in this film because to me she played the title character with such grace and elegance that you can't help but love her performance. As for Michael Fassbender, to me, personally, he is the perfect person to play the character of Edward Rochester. Whenever he stepped on to the screen he had me in a grip that forced me to watch him every single time. I definitely can see some Oscar nods for both of them. The supporting cast was also very good. Judi Dench was magnificent as always as Miss Fairfax the housekeeper. Jamie Bell definitely shined his brightest of all the films I've seen him in. I think they might just reign supreme in the categories of Best Supporting Actor and Actress. The set and the cinematography are absolutely beautiful. It sets the perfect tone for the film that I rather liked. The film kind of played out like a thriller until the ending then it all made sense of the theme.This film to me is not just eye candy it is by far one of the best films of the year. If it doesn't get at least get nominated for Best Picture at he Oscars this year it will have been robbed.",Jane Eyre
113,ladyjatbay-1,Tops 1944 Version,10,30 March 2011,"First, I think the acting was superb. I rarely, and I mean rarely express any interest in a remake of a classic film. Yet, something piqued my curiosity from the review and it was free, so why not! Mia is exactly what I would have thought Jane looked like, plain and homely. Michael plays Rochester without so much emotion or romance which is more true to the novel. Judi Dench brings a sense of humor to the role of Mrs. Fairfax, although you aren't meant to laugh it is hard not to. Young Adele/Romy actually speaks French which is more accurate and she is a doll. Young Jane/Amelia is adorable and well played showing a more violent version of the abuse she suffered rather than playing it down for 1944 standards. I'd say only Helen/Freya got the shaft because her role was about 2 minutes long, not quite as much time on screen as with Elizabeth Taylor in 44.What I liked more than anything though was that this film showed the missing pieces of the novel. Jane's path to enlightenment, when she runs away and falls into the doorway of the parson and his two young sisters. This was such a crucial piece to the book and it is nice to see it in action finally. Though the cameraman in the opening scenes of Jane running away (her story is a long flashback), is like the Blair Witch Project and for a minute I thought I would hate this movie. Thank God the camera jumping was short lived. Why directors think this makes sense is beyond me. It is horrible and makes one nauseous.I really loved this film as you can see and I hope you get a chance to watch it if you are a Jane fan. I don't think you will be too disturbed even though it is a modern version. If you haven't read the book though, please do this first before you go to see any version. How ignorant the people were in my audience, I was so embarrassed for them. When they showed the scene of Thornfield Hall, at Jane's return, everyone gasped. Really? You are that illiterate? Anyway, you cannot truly appreciate viewing this film unless you understand and have read the novel.",Jane Eyre

Beautifully made, wonderfully cast. A gorgeous version.",Jane Eyre

116,itsgillian_w,Beautiful adaptation,10,20 March 2011,"I read the reviews of this film a few days before it was released, and one critic said it was the best JE adaptation she had ever seen. Well, then. I had high expectations.WOW. It totally surpassed my expectations.I'm a huge fan of the book, so I was a bit unsure of this film (before I saw it, of course) because it may have altered some main details. Not true. Yes, some parts were altered, but not altered so much that it was a fallacy. Not in any way were the changes a fallacy. The changes were minor. The acting is wonderful, you can really sense the chemistry between Wasikowska's Jane and Fassbender's Rochester. It's well written, and the screen-writer has added in some quirky little moments that made everyone in my theatre laugh out loud. In other words, I loved this movie. It was a beautiful film, and it was well worth the two hour car ride to see it. I can't wait for the DVD.5/5",Jane Eyre
117,rohansrider,Could have been better especially if you have not read the book.,7,1 October 2011,"Unlike many here, I did not feel this was a classic. The narrative was chopped about too much. Unless you know the book well you could be forgiven for some confusion. There was no atmosphere of menace or enigma portrayed at Thornfield; when Jane first arrived it should build slowly;other bad errors: where was the presence of Grace Pool? Terrible mistake with the fire, it was his canopy bed, not the curtains and Jane threw water on him. Too much was cut out, even allowing for time poignant scenes from Lowood, and also with the Reeds, they were not there. The trouble is that the Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephen's version surpasses all and much longer because it was serialized. I urge those of you interested, to read the book, and understand that this version was not strong. Good acting but weak narrative. I was disappointed because like so many I love the story. Apart from a better Rochester,(Fassbender) this is no better than the Franco Zeffirelli version. I thought the young Jane was weak and rather miscast and easily forgotten.",Jane Eyre
118,Claire-loves-the-movies,"Good, but not as good as I expected",7,8 June 2012,"This movie actually disappointed me a tiny bit. This is probably because of the extremely high expectations I had but still. The story line is changed up, but they really should have left it. Don't mess with a good thing, right. It starts with Jane leaving Rochester and is told through one giant flashback from after she reaches the Rivers house. Because of this there is almost no scenes actually at the Rivers house even though she is there the whole time. That means that the time she spends away from Rochester is very short so you don't get the same impact when they reunite. If you haven't seen the movie before, or read the book, you would be very confused because they leave out some very important scenes that explain a lot. One very good thing was the acting. Mia Wasikowska is amazing of course, as she is in all the movies she plays in. Micheal Fassbender is wonderful, though I do think he is a bit to attractive to be Rochester, as he is supposed to be ugly, but thats not his fault, and he is still a very good actor with lots of emotional capabilities. Judi Dench I don't even need to talk about, the only unfortunate thing is that she is in such a small role. Jamie Bell I love, and again it is only unfortunate that he is in such a small role. Despite the things I didn't like about this movie, I still enjoyed myself. Watch it, you may love it, you may hate it, you may fell the same as me, but definitely go see it. Its worth it.",Jane Eyre
119,KurotsutaMurasaki,A Masterpiece to Match the Source Material and Far Surpass it's predecessors in both Soul and Heart,10,1 November 2018,"Every review is colored by the personal opinions and preferences of those who write them. I am no exception. I have seen several adaptations of Jane Eyre, and have lately read the novel for the first time in order to have a more full understanding of the story and make informed judgments about the versions I watch.
Jane Eyre (2011) is not a perfect adaptation, but of the ones I have watched (2006, 1983, 1996 and 1944) this version stands head and shoulders above the rest. The casting could not have been more impeccable. Mia Wasikowska was chosen for the role of Jane because of her ability to observe as a character and to portray inward emotions without being theatrical. She is also physically suitable for the role, being small, plain and fair.
Michael Fassbender may not have the uncommonly broad-chest, jetty brows and hair, or dark eyes described by Bronte, but he is also not conventionally handsome - his features are appropriately rough-hewn. His attractiveness lies in his charisma, not his looks. He was chosen for the role because he captured well the spirit of Bronte's flawed hero. Admittedly, some of his harsher moods were played down; though, due to the condensed nature of the adaptation (It is a film after all - were it a mini-series I would not excuse it), I think it was not a bad decision - anything more would be jarring in the time the film was allowed.
The chemistry between the leading actors lends tension which is absent in other adaptations, making those versions less engaging and believable.
This beautiful film is carried by an equally beautiful and fitting score. The haunting string accompaniments were always well placed and lent to the Gothic air, once again, without being so theatrical as to overwhelm, and not so dark as to ruin the tone of a love scene.
The dialogue, while slightly altered so as to make it less cumbersome for the screen has been criticized by some as being ""Simplified"". I would like to rebut by saying that while altered, it is still accurate to the period and the most important passages were preserved accurately, if not totally verbatim.
I applaud Cary Fukunaga's decision to use only what lighting the fire and candles in the sets provided - it really puts into perspective just how very dark everything was in this time period. The fires cast long shadows which added to the dark aspects of the tale.
I have seen it criticized - it has been called gray, dull, inaccurate, simplified and lacking in passion, heart or the Gothic aspect of the novel. And to my way of thinking, those who describe this film as such must indeed lack any sense of subtlety. Flamboyance is not the sum total of a Gothic tale.
The beauty of this film lies not in the colors or flamboyance that other versions have offered as a cheap trick to imitate passion. It lies, rather, in the tension of the in-between moments. HOW can anyone watch Fassbender's Rochester cling to Jane on the brink of despair as Jane herself struggles internally with the battle between her morals and her desires and say that this film lacks the soul or heart of other versions?! I put it to you that this film has as much soul and full as much heart. Those who cannot see beyond a gray landscape and a bleak tone, and miss the fantastic artistry of this film, Bronte's work brought to life as no other adaptation has managed before, completely misses the true nature of Jane's story.",Jane Eyre
120,SkayM87,Atmospheric and Enjoyable!,8,3 April 2014,"As a massive fan of the whole Jane Eyre franchise, I have to say I was really disappointed when the cast list was first released. However, after watching it recently I was extremely presently surprised! Mia plays an excellent Jane, I can understand why some people thought she gave a wooden performance but the character of Jane is not over-dramatic, her narrative in the book is full of passion and emotion, but outwardly, she is very subtle in these traits. Mia pulled it off in my opinion. Michael Fassbender gave an excellent performance of Mr Rochester! He portrayed the complex character very well and had such a great on screen presence in this roll. Mr Rochester has always been my favourite fictional character, so I was really pleased with how Michael portrayed him. I also thought the casting of Mrs Fairfax (Judi Dench) was great too. I did however feel that there wasn't as much chemistry between the characters as there should have been (compared with the books). I think individually they were great, but together there was something lacking. Never the less, I enjoyed the film so much and became utterly engrossed in the Jane Eyre world, the way I usually do when I read the book. The atmosphere created by the sets, lighting and filming were superb! Very atmospheric and haunting! However, I wish that they had included more content featured in the trailer, in the finished film. I am glad for the deleted scenes on the DVD as they fill in some of the blanks, that those unfamiliar to Jane Eyre, would not be privy to. I am hoping that an extended version will be released at some point! If this was a TV series version, and was allowed to take place over 4 hours, it would be the best adaptation out there.",Jane Eyre
121,debumymailbox,"Good, not the perfect.",7,25 December 2018,"Characterization is superb. All casts matched perfectly with characters of the novel, specially Jane. Mia is the perfect match for Jane. Landscape, background scene, weather, atmosphere, costume all were perfectly set up.
But the director skipped some key factors of the novel. That's made it incomplete. The inner feeling of both Bronte and Jane can't be felt by viewers who haven't read the novel.
The proposal scene was at night in the novel. But here it was in the dusk. Rochester lost his eye sight and a hand in the novel. Here he lost only eye sight.",Jane Eyre

123,degrimstead-1,Films of this book have always been good,8,29 September 2011,"Because I adored the book I've found all film versions of this story to be enjoyable, though I think I enjoyed the 2006 TV mini-series best. But maybe that was just because they drew it out in four separate episodes; it's such an engrossing story. These actors were quite good, with Mia Wasikowska's eyes and face being a perfect canvas for Jane's emotions and Michael Fassbender playing a fine Rochester. My one criticism would be that, rather than telling the story chronologically as is done in the book, and in all other filmed versions I've seen, here they chose to jump around in time, even starting the film in the middle. Maybe this is what led to their leaving out Jane staying on at Lowood and becoming a teacher (though they referred to this they didn't show it, which was disappointing). And they didn't show how her young friend at school contracted her illness, either. Still, a very good two hours and I do recommend it.",Jane Eyre
124,Atuatucorum,It could have been so much more...,7,22 July 2011,"This most recent adaptation of ""Jane Eyre"" is a visual masterpiece. The setting is carefully planned to represent characterisations and emotional states through nature or objects. Heavy rain underscores the turbulence within Jane as she runs from Thornfield. Fog mysteriously veils her first meeting with Mr Rochester, bright sunlight showcases the happiness of the couple during and after the proposal. Windows sometimes obstruct the view when Jane feels trapped. Darkness falls when she is confused or thinking. Colourful flowers and fluttering leaves frame her playful interactions with her fiancée. Yes, visually, there is next to nothing that could still be wished for.One pivotal element of ""Jane Eyre"" is the mystery of Mr Rochester's past. There is a ghost at Thornfield Hall, the identity of which is crucial to further developments in the plot. Bertha Rochester, although never seen, must be felt at all times; her presence is the key to understanding Rochester's behaviour. This is one aspect where the adaptation fell woefully short. Adéle tells her new governess that a woman haunts the corridors at times, but no clues are given as to who she might be. Grace Poole, the infamous scapegoat Rochester uses in the novel to explain the terrifying events at Thornfield Hall, is not seen or even spoken of until the day of the wedding. All of this could be overlooked had the actual encounter with Bertha left more of an impact. There is a dream-like quality about that scene, aided by the sudden inclusion of echoes. I felt, however, that this decision softened the impact; meeting Mr Rochester's wife should have had a brutal effect on Jane and the watcher. It was underwhelming. They also forfeited the chance to depict Bertha setting Thornfield Hall on fire and instead had Mrs Fairfax tell Jane what had transpired. At the end of the film, we do not know who Bertha really is; her development should have aided that of Jane.""Jane Eyre"", the novel, is not a tragedy. In fact, it exudes strength, energy and a positive attitude in spite of unhappy times and circumstances. It was therefore discomfiting to see so much restraint and gloominess well after the first scene had played out. Everybody spoke in hushed voices, even the Rivers, as if they, too, had a Bertha lurking in their attic. In fact, there are only two instances where someone actually speaks in a loud voice: once at the wedding, once when St John tells Jane that they must marry. The actors are thus given little opportunity to act through their voices, e.g. by varying intonation. This is also a problem of the script. Rochester makes one joke to Adéle about her and her mother's charm; there could easily have been more instances of that. The ending, too, should have involved pronounced happiness; Mia Wasikowska's Jane shed tears where she should have been the woman in control. By the end of the novel, she has the strength to draw Mr Rochester out and alleviate his gloomy state. Here, she is toned down too much and thus misrepresented.Another aspect that might have been handled better concerns the characters. The Reeds, Helen Burns, Bertha and Grace Poole are gone almost as soon as they are introduced. Adéle is disturbingly quiet; Mrs Fairfax is much too clever. Of the Rivers family, only St John is fleshed out to some degree; Miss Oliver was left out completely, however. St John merely relates to Jane that his struggles in the past are similar to hers. This is an unfortunate statement, as it creates the impression that he once truly loved and had his heart broken due to regrettable circumstances. A wholly different light could have been shed on him easily had his sisters been given a line or two. As it is, Jane observes that her concept of love differs from St John's, yet it is not shown how she arrived at that conclusion.Blanche Ingram is underplayed to a point where she becomes unbelievable as a threat to Jane's happiness. In the novel, she is a foil to Jane, possessing the status and the cruel traits Jane lacks. The audience of this film is shown little more than her beautiful profile; Jane's neck fills so much of the screen that Miss Ingram gets little chance to shine. Gone is Mr Rochester's careful scheming. He openly acts in a confused manner when Jane speaks of Blanche as his love interest.The film succeeded, on the other hand, in the depiction of a believable love story between its leads. Fassbender and Wasikowska have chemistry; especially the post-wedding scenes show how much better they could have been throughout the film had the blandness in the script not harmed them. Jane taking off her wedding dress in tears is one of the most moving scenes. It is followed by Rochester lying on the floor in a rather funny posture; there, his anxiety and his concern for her translate extremely well. It is a pity that they had so few of these opportunities; at times, I found myself wondering whether they understood their characters fully. My misgivings about the proposal scene were happily only confirmed to some extent. I would have liked to see more of an emotional outburst on Wasikowska's side, but she did handle it fairly well.To conclude, it was certainly not the worst adaptation ever, in spite of its shortcomings. It must be stated, however, that it is a far cry from what it could have been. The limited running time does not explain everything that went wrong; I had to push my knowledge of the novel to the back of my mind, because I did not feel it was translated accurately to the big screen. As a standalone piece, it is marvellous. I will be happy to give it another chance when it comes out on DVD.",Jane Eyre
125,kathymonktrudy,"Not bad, but have seen better",5,20 September 2011,"Jane Eyre has to be one of the best classics of all time, with its intricate plot and darkly mysterious, brooding atmosphere.It seems such a shame that this film has been made and yet has, in my opinion, left out all of the passion and feeling which makes Jane Eyre the critically acclaimed story that it undoubtedly is.I felt that Jane was too young, incredibly passionless and quite insipid in this part, which is a shame, as I do not consider this to be a true representation of the Jane from the novel. Mr Rochester was not too bad, although he wasn't interesting enough. Part of Mr Rochester's attractiveness comes from the fact that he is so abrupt, whimsical and mysterious. The viewer wants to know who he really is beneath the mask. Unfortunately, I did not feel like this at all when watching Michael Fassbender act out this part.It is a shame, as I feel that any film version of this great novel should convey the vibrancy, feeling, mystery and passion which harbours within its pages and yet I was left feeling disappointed that this had not been achieved.Having said that, I could not say that the acting was particularly bad or that the film couldn't hold the interest of its viewers; simply that, for myself, being a Jane Eyre enthusiast, the casting and also the cuts that were made to make this film disappointed me.",Jane Eyre
126,emptyvoices,Adequate but not breathtaking,5,29 March 2011,"Being one of my favorite books, I was excited to see another take on Jane Eyre and while the presentation was not horrifying, I found it somewhat mediocre. Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender were unremarkable in their chemistry together. It lacked the emotion the masterpiece theater version had with Ruth Wilson as Jane Eyre and Toby Stephens as Mr. Rochester. That was truly a beautiful telling. This movie was a poor shadow of it.Although an adequate representation, I felt it was a waste of Judi Dench's considerable talent to simply squander it on Mrs. Fairfax where the writer of the screenplay did nothing to show how versatile this actress is.The ending of the movie lacked any substance and felt cut off with the last line which was saccharine and left no explanation whatsoever as to what happened to these characters. I suppose by then, I didn't care since I didn't feel pulled in or emotionally involved in the entirety of the story. I will say that Jamie Bell did a very decent job as Mr. St. John Rivers.My advice to anyone in seeing this movie is to wait to rent it on DVD. It's not worth the $10.00 or more dollars to see it in the theater and if you haven't seen the 2006 Masterpiece Theater version, then please take advantage of that film because that was a wonderful version.",Jane Eyre
127,travisk-11-189335,Graduates from required reading to accomplished cinema...,7,27 March 2011,"Jane Eyre, played by Mia Wasakowska (ALICE IN WONDERLAND), has become a quiet, reserved young woman. Her mind, however, remains sharp and her words reflect this intellect in a humble manner working as governess for Mr. Rochester's (Michael Fassbender) French daughter. Fassbender is compelling as the slightly depressed, often ill-tempered master of the large and impressive Thornfield Hall, but there's also a vulnerability that allows him to see through Jane's humble disguise and see her for her true self. Judi Dench (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE) plays Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper for Thornfield Hall and occasional confidant to Jane Eyre as she attempts to decipher his encrypted attempts at showing his true feelings for her.JANE EYRE was adapted into a screenplay by Moira Buffini and directed by Cary Fukunaga (SIN NOMBRE). Perhaps the first and most pleasurable element of the film to be noticed is the stunning cinematography from Adriano Goldman (CITY OF MEN), rich with picturesque landscapes dulled and dampened by the gray skies and misty airs of England. Closely connected to this visceral visual interpretation of Jane Eyre's emotional state, is the original music composed by Dario Marianelli (THE SOLOIST), classical and laden with the tormented beauty of the violin.As for the story itself, JANE EYRE delivers a refreshing amount of suspense and mystery into a genre film which — in my opinion – rarely does more than put me asleep. As a viewer, I was immersed into Jane's dilemma, especially as it's connected to her troubled past as a neglected child. Another interesting element that makes JANE EYRE a relative success is the choice to break the narrative into a non-linear flow. This essentially plays three-card Monty with Jane's life, adding to the mystery for the viewer, which is already intrinsic to the story at hand those familiar with the novel know what I mean.Mia Wasakowska shows a more enlightened, fully mature side of her acting talents as Jane Eyre, reserving much of her characters' emotions in her withheld reactions, a pleasant step forward from the unremarkable ALICE IN WONDERLAND adaption where she fared most average. Michael Fassbender (INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS) shines without going over the top, as he usually does in his own unique way. This, I believe more than anything, is the brilliant curse of Fassbender, always promising a stellar performance that is just subtle enough to keep him off the viewing public's radar.The pace of JANE EYRE, at a length of 115 minutes, is neither slow nor upbeat. The film clearly has it's peaks and valleys, both in pace and intrigue. At times, most often when Jane and Mr. Rochester converse, the film is dynamic with dialogue delivered with great timing and subdued intensity, yet at other times in between the drab story is made bearable only by the creative crafts of Goldman and Marianelli.Read my full review at... http://wearemoviegeeks.com/2011/03/jane-eyre-the-review/",Jane Eyre

Truly, there is no movie to match this adaptation of 'Jane Eyre'- the grouchiness and depth is so true to the book that I could not help but feel the temptation to run across the moors with the measly little governess as Rochester cried 'JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANE!"". Secondhand embarrassment washed over me like rain as the couple wed in the dreary church, the priest smiling weakly and attempting to join the hands that were destined to touch. I say this to try and convey how realistic each scene is to the viewer. As for the cast, Rochester may not be as passionate as he was in the novel, but he certainly is dark and grumpy enough to pull off the 'Byronic hero vibe'.If you want to feel the essence of Rochester shine from within, I highly recommend this delicate and accurate portrayal of 'Jane Eyre'.",Jane Eyre
131,mariayovita,Jane Eyre,7,19 June 2013,"Still fangirling over Michael Fassbender, I watched his other films. After falling for him first in X-Men: First Class (2011), rekindled it in Inglourious Basterds (2009) plus, I didn't realize that he's in 300 (2006), this time I watched Jane Eyre (2011). (Greetings British film that capture the life of high class and middle class people in 1830s. Hello again!) Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga and starring Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre, Jamie Bell as St. John Rivers and Michael Fassbender as Edward Fairfax Rochester. I have never fully read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë, I only read the simplified version of it (for kids) when I was in my first year of senior high. So I didn't really know the atmosphere of the novel, etc. But in my opinion this version has some better qualities compared to the BBC version of 2006, starring Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson. First, the character of Jane Eyre by Mia Wasikowska is captured perfectly according to the character's real age in the novel. Mia Wasikowska makes Jane Eyre more humane, giving us insights of her terrible past and childhood and at the same time not decreasing her character. Michael Fassbender's Edward Rochester is also more constantly coarse, real and sympathetic (besides of course more effortlessly handsome than Toby Stephen's portrayal). Unfortunately, with Michael Fassbender being cast as Edward Rochester, they should have casted someone at least 'equal' to him as St. John Rivers. Placing Jamie Bell as St. John Rivers is really a no-match for Michael Fassbender, moreover with his tendency to rebel-insecure-appearance (I always capture this teenage-rebel-appearance whenever I watch Jamie Bell). I have to say that Jamie Bell is somewhat miscast. (Plus, his great chemistry with Mia Wasikowska from Defiance (2008) still lingers in me, so...) The cinematography is really beautiful with its candlelights, shades and natural lights. The choice of music is a no-brainer. The costumes are marvelous. Plus, they have Judi Dench playing as Mrs. Fairfax! (Is Judi Dench overrated? Maybe, but I still adore her) What this film lacks of, is time. I wish it would be longer, even though I like the brief ending better in this film than in the 2006 version. It gives more room to our imagination about how the ending will proceed. Being a TV mini series, the 2006 version is more unimpeded dealing with the development of its characters and making sure its correct connection with the novel. Also what I find disturbing is in the scene when Jane Eyre sitting by herself in her small 'schouse'. She wrapped herself in blanket that has embedded modern font in it, see for yourself. I find it utterly disturbing. Where the hell they got the blanket from? Setting, properties... hello?",Jane Eyre

133,mcoia,"Jane Eyre is, ultimately, worth seeing",7,5 April 2011,"Here we are again. Another adaptation of the novel Jane Eyre written by Charlotte Bronte. This time Mia Wasikowska (Alice in Wonderland) plays the main character, Jane Eyre, and Michael Fassbender (Inglorious Basterds) plays her love interest, Edward Rochester. The big question, surrounding the film, is, well, is this film worth seeing since it has practically been done to death already. Overall, I would say yes. For starters the film's beautiful cinematography alone makes the film worth seeing. In fact, that's the best thing the film has to offer and that is no insult to the actors and actresses that starred in the film. There are plenty of beautiful shots showing the open countryside of England as Jane wanders around, trying to find her place. Even inside the mansions the cinematography is just breathtaking and it truly adds to the film. The cinematography of the film creates a unique atmosphere that at times makes the film almost seem like a horror flick and it adds to the Gothic nature of the film. One of the major standouts that I took notice to was the film's score. The score was done by Dario Marianelli, and he did a magnificent job. The score added tension to many scenes and, like the cinematography, added greatly to the atmosphere of the film. I feel without the strong score the film would have, at times, fallen flat and completely lost the interest of its audience and been a disaster. Another strong point of the movie is the acting. Wasikowska plays a strong Jane Eyre and is definitely worthy of playing the role. She holds her own against the likes of Judi Dench and other great actors. Fassbender is equally, if not better, as great as Wasikowska and the two have wonderful chemistry together and it adds to the quality of the film. If the chemistry was absent between the two lead parts the film could have easily fallen apart and been a major disappointment. There are several scenes where the chemistry between Wasikowska and Fassbender truly shines and makes the film come to life.However, while the film may have great cinematography, acting and a phenomenal score one cannot help but feel that the film seemed rushed. Too many crucial scenes of the film felt either short or rushed and ultimately it hurt the film. At times the scenes between Wasikowska and Fassbender didn't feel right even though the two had great chemistry. The film didn't leave enough time for their love to truly develop and feel natural. Instead, their love felt forced and at times unbelievable although the both connected well. It was not the actor's fault in this film it was the screenwriters fault who didn't let the love grow appropriately.Overall, if you're a fan of the novel you won't be disappointed. There is enough in the film to keep the audience interested and that is what matters when all is said is done. Mia Wasikowska plays, what could be, the finest portrayal of Jane Eyre yet and is not let down by her fellow cast members. The film has wonderful cinematography and score that add to the film's atmosphere. If you haven't read the novel, like me, and you're interested in this type of movie I would easily recommend it.",Jane Eyre
134,praghalathank,A beautiful rendition of Charlotte Brontë's epic romance story,10,20 November 2014,"Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre provides a catharsis for love and romance in its pure and concentrated form. It is nearly impossible to portray it fully in a movie of 2 hours. Cary Fukunaga (The Director) has done a very good job considering these difficulties.The casting of Mia Wasikowska (Jane Eyre) and Michael Fassbender (Edward Rochester) are appropriate. Mia's subtle expressions of yearning, love and despair are beautiful. I cannot think of a better actress than Mia to play the role of Jane Eyre. Though Michael Fassbender does not fit Brontë's description of a manly and not-so- handsome figure, he does a perfect portrayal of Rochester's character otherwise. Jamie Bell's performance seems to be dwarfed by the acting of the two lead actors, which is otherwise a decent performance.The ending of the movie, in my opinion was a bit abrupt – considering the way it is narrated in the novel.Overall this movie is one of the best adaptations of classical literature I have seen.10 out of 10.",Jane Eyre
135,bogus_fn,"A different IMDb-review of this version, apparently",5,8 September 2011,"I must admit I was quite surprised at the high praises this version of Jane Eyre gets on IMDb. I've read the novel several times, saw 4 adaptations of it, and this one was only OK for me.The movie starts off well and portrays Jane's early life satisfactorily enough. Unfortunately, the rest of it and the evolving romance of Jane and Rochester is quite bad. Now, I do not expect a 120min movie to include every single detail, but then everything in this version is so rushed to the point where you don't even get why these two characters are drawn to each other in the first place. Mia Wasikowska does a decent job in her portrayal of Jane, though I did not care for Fassbender's portrayal of Rochester. I think the Rochester character wasn't written or directed well at all. Rochester has a very dominant presence. He's rough, commanding, even violent. He's also passionate in everything he does, sensual and exciting. And to all this there's yet another very important element which so many other Rochesters also lack - lovability. The kind that makes you affectionately smile at him even when he's angry and generally being unpleasant. I did not get any of that in the 2011-Rochester I'm afraid and think they completely missed the mark with him (Toby Stephens of the BBC's version was absolutely wonderful in that respect). But most of all, I was bothered by the total lack of chemistry between the actors which is such an important ingredient in an adaptation of Jane Eyre.Jane Eyre is a passionate beautiful and sensual love story and I do not advise anyone who hasn't read it, to start with this on screen version of it. Only faithful readers can overlook defects and see the beauty behind the many flaws. All in all I give it a 5/10.",Jane Eyre
136,michaelwebb-280-50285,Gresat film,8,1 February 2012,"I saw a sneak preview of Jane Eyre last night at AFI/Silver in Silver Spring MD. This is a beautifully filmed, engrossing, and haunting version of the classic Charlotte Bronte novel Jane Eyre. This film is worth seeing and it will leave you thinking about it long after you have left the theater. It captures that otherworldly and isolated environment that Jane inhabits in her lonely life. After you witness the unloved childhood and brutal boarding school you can understand how Jane can not only adapt to her isolated employment but revel in a world where the absence of abuse is a relief. One thing that struck me was the way the actress portraying Jane Eyre, Mia Wasikowska, inhabited Jane's being. The quiet stillness, the dignity, the steely nerves under the mask of composure. I have been trying to recall another actress who portrayed the physicality of a woman, a governess, in that time period so perfectly. She wasn't a modern actress in a corset, she moved like a young woman who is used to the corset and layers of cloth, and the expectations on a young woman in Victorian England. I also particularly enjoyed the portrayal of a vibrant, intelligent, woman who knows she is caged by the norms of her society and her position in it. Miss Wasikowska did a wonderful portrayal of Jane, giving her great depth while still letting the emotions flit across her usually stoic face. I also liked Mrs Reed - she is a wholly human villain, petty, cruel, insecure, and resentful. You can see her in Miss Ingram, a petty woman who could turn hateful. The young Jane is a stand out performance, all spit and fury, you realize that Jane's survival is due to her courage. That the intensity of the child is coiled inside the adult Jane. The cinematography is beautiful, the sets and costumes look accurate, the screenplay handled well, and the directing outstanding. I also appreciate that no character was over done. This film will age well, where some other versions can make you cringe now. This film is going to make me pick up the novel and read it again after a very long time. Not a bad recommendation for a movie.",Jane Eyre
137,TwistedCream,Read Review,10,6 May 2016,"Just saw the best film since I saw ""It's a Wonderful Life"". I feel as if a spirit has lifted my soul and I can hardly breathe. The tears I feel are not only cased in anguish, but filled by joy. Though the empathy I feel for the character, and yet the writer burdens me so. Hope has burdened me so, and there is no limit to it's burden. The pain that this film has caused me, is worth another day of life. For I believe that the juice is worth the squeeze. If you see one film this year...Let it be ""Jane Eyre"".The anxiety and depression displayed is so human, that I feel worth being.",Jane Eyre
138,thomas-r-jackson,Wonderful Film,10,20 May 2017,"This is a wonderful movie, beautifully filmed and acted, excellently directed, authentically costumed in period wardrobe, with a haunting and sublime soundtrack, virtually a perfect film. It is the story of an orphan girl in early 19th century northern England raised in a fine home by a rich uncaring aunt, sent off to a harsh charity school and then employed as a governess at the Thornfield Manor Home of a wealthy English gentleman, Edward Fairfax Rochester. The countryside in which the story is set is so beautifully photographed as to become itself a character in the drama. Mia Wasikowska is transfixing as Jane Eyre. She so embodies the character of Jane that you don't even think of it as acting. Her face is marvelously expressive so that much of the inward drama of the story unfolds there. Michael Fassbender as Rochester is also excellent as is Judi Dench (as always) as the housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax, in an almost wholly sympathetic part. Jamie Bell as the not very likable St. John Rivers and the child actors who play young Jane (Patricia Clarkson) and Helen Burns (Freya Parks) are also outstanding. Helen Burns is otherworldly in her stoical resolution in the face of corporal punishment (""Miss Scatcherd is tormented by my faults. She beats me to improve me."") These little girls show tremendous courage in the endurance of their plight. Jane Eyre is practically a heroic figure. Her fortitude in the face of hardship and sacrifice and disappointment is inspiring. The Jane Eyre story is epicly powerful, having about it almost the quality of Greek myth. Her abandonment of Thornfield and the hardships of her separation and her eventual return have something about them of the nature of the wanderings of the great Greek hero Odysseus. The landscape of the film is magical and charmed: ""there is an invisible world all around you"" says Helen to the young Jane. ""A kingdom of spirits commissioned to guard you."" The sense of magic recurs again and again and is the critical element in the story's climax when Jane is called back to her true love. I feel lucky to have first come to this story in the form of this film. I waited to write this review until after a careful reading of the novel. Not to say the movie is better than the book - that is wonderfully powerful too. The book just grows on you more slowly than the movie does. There are differences between the two, none of which, IMHO, detract from the original. The story is told in the film as a flashback, unlike the novel, but that has the effect of thrusting you immediately into the height of the drama. The first few minutes of the film can seem a little bleak and that was the only moment my first time watching that I thought the movie might be too grim to bear. After that, however, the force of young Jane's character begins to impress on you and the story becomes riveting. There is not a slow moment in the entire film. In the novel, the dialogue unfolds much more slowly, reflective of the early 19th century time period. The film strips the dialogue to its barest minimums. What is left are the most powerful highlights at the key moments of the story. Indelible cinematographic images convey the essence of much narration: Jane in a mist shrouded glade surprised by a bird flying up in her face on the way to post a letter just before she first meets Edward, a wide angle shot of Rochester dragging his young bride to the altar, Jane frantically stripping off her wedding gown. In addition to all the other wonders of this film, a special mention should be made of the performance of the beautiful child actress in the part of Adele Varons (Romy Setbon Moore). The questionable offspring of Fairfax Rochester's former liaison with a French opera singer, now deceased, the little girl perfectly embodies the innocence and vulnerability of the novel's character. With her exquisite French, big innocent eyes and joyous sprightliness she is a visual treat: superficial, simple, full of blithe innocence and vulnerability. Her expressions mirror Jane's own emotional state. She is the loyal acolyte with dog-like devotion sharing in both the joys and disappointments of her mentor. Finally a minor quibble: the film's abrupt ending is a trifle disappointing in comparison to the novel. The last chapter in the novel before the conclusion is one of the most moving passages of fiction I have ever read. The passage is a long paroxysm of joy and sadness that slowly evolves into a blissful scene of long delayed happiness that shows both the characters of Jane and Fairfax Rochester in their best light. Cinematically I can understand the decision to leave this out of the film – it would be difficult, if not impossible to make this passage not seem anti-climactic, tending to deflate the power of the lovers' final reunion. One of the few treats I could find that the novel offers the film does not.",Jane Eyre
139,tassyachaca,Hypnotize,9,24 December 2017,"I admit this story will make the heart of anyone who watches melt. The way Jane Eyre tells the story of a woman who lived in misery all her life and how Rochester is portrayed as a cold but intimidating man, looking rude but caring. If you are looking for sadness in this movie, YOU WILL NOT GET IT. But when you are looking for a classic romance story wrapped with a real problem of a poor woman with a rich man then you are in the right place.The very right story is spent in my spare time or holiday, I really do not regret my day by watching this. Their way of their gazing and the way they express feelings will take you through time, how Jane who craves happiness, turns up in an unexpected time. Always full of what Rochester is thinking.Unfortunately, I did not get too much emotion of grief from Mia Wasikowka, her way of portraying the sadness of lessening my feelings when I saw her",Jane Eyre

Her release of emotion on the moors made me weep with her. You could almost hear her heart breaking after having no love in her life then finding it only to have it taken away struck me as one of the saddest moments in the film. The parts when she is with St. John and his sisters back to her comfort zone of a stoic personality made me cry for her as well and gradually hearing Rochester voice over the moors calling for her and eventually leading her back to him brought comfort to both of them as they were finally able to help heal each others damaged souls.",Jane Eyre

The script is smart, interesting takes us back to the English literature romantic plots where love stories seed in difficult situations and fate takes most unexpected curves, and all delivered with great performance from all the actors, the costumes the filming the direction almost as satisfying as the latest Pride and prejudice production. It is always hard to like a movie when you have read the book or have watched a previous version, at least the factor of an unknown story isn't there but this isn't a weakness in Jane Eyre 2011 it sure isn't.

At least Drive is getting well represented at the Critic's Choice Awards. But this film couldn't even get that. This is the most underrated film of 2011, by far! Wasikowska kills it, Fassbender kills it! Fukunaga is a young, brilliant, exciting, director on the rise. See his film ""Sin Nombre"" (2009) in addition to this one.

145,authorsyriejames,"A worthy new version of ""Jane Eyre"" with marvelous visuals and excellent performances",9,8 March 2011,"Charlotte Brontë's ""Jane Eyre"" has been my favorite book since I was 11 years old. The tale of a feisty orphan-girl-turned-governess who finds true love in a spooky mansion and ultimately redeems a tormented hero has made it to the top of every ""Best Love Stories"" list since it was first published in 1847, and with good reason. It's the perfect Gothic novel, melding mystery, horror, and the classic medieval castle setting with heart-stopping romance. There have been at least 18 film versions of ""Jane Eyre"" and 9 made-for-television movies--27 in all! I have seen most of them, some multiple times–-both out of my deep love for the tale, and as part of the research for my novel ""The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Brontë,"" the true story of Charlotte's remarkable life, her inspiration behind ""Jane Eyre,"" and her turbulent, real-life romance.Every screen version of JANE EYRE has its merits. I especially loved Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Mr. Rochester in the 1983 mini-series, and the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre mini-series starring Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens. I was very curious to see how the new JANE EYRE adaptation from Focus Films would measure up. I am happy to report that the film, which I saw last night at an advance screening, is very good indeed, with marvelous visuals, terrific performances, and enough unique elements to make it a worthy new addition.The most notable distinction that sets this film apart from the rest is its structure. Rather than telling the tale in a linear fashion, it begins at a crisis moment later in the story, and tells the majority of the tale in flashback–-which works wonderfully well, enabling screenwriter Moira Buffini to effectively compress a long novel into a two-hour time span.The movie opens as Jane is fleeing Thornfield after having discovered Mr. Rochester's dark and heartbreaking secret. We fear for her as she becomes lost on the stormy moor. The mystery continues as St. John Rivers (well-played by a sympathetic yet appropriately stern Jamie Bell) and his sisters take her in. As Jane ruminates about the past events that led to her escape, we are treated to the story in flashback.The casting of Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre also sets this production apart, since she is closer in age than most actresses who've played the role to the character in the novel, who was about 18 years old in the Thornfield section. Although I wish Mia's Jane was a bit more ""swoony"" over Mr. Rochester earlier on (yes, she is supposed to be stoic, but I missed that phase where we get to see her blossom as she falls in love with him, and then is utterly crushed when she believes him to be in love with Miss Ingram), Mia truly inhabits the role, beautifully portraying Jane's sense of self-respect, integrity, and restraint, as well as her passion and vulnerability.Michael Fassbender embodies Mr. Rochester with the ideal blend of charisma and sinister brooding, while at the same time allowing glimpses of his underlying desperation and the wounded depths of his soul. Sally Hawkins as Mrs. Reed effectively portrays the icy ogre who menaces the young Jane (a spirited and appealing Amelia Clarkson.) And Judi Dench, as always, gives a superb performance as housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax.The film's locations do justice to the novel's often gloomy, atmospheric tone. Director Cary Fukunaga makes excellent use of Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, one of the oldest houses in England, as Thornfield Hall, emphasizing its dark, Gothic, masculine feel. The exterior locations--gardens, cliffs, craggy rocks, stone walls, and seemingly endless fields--make an arresting, dramatic backdrop for the story. You truly feel as though you are in the middle of nowhere.My only minor gripes are that when Mr. Rochester's secret is revealed, it feels a little too prettified, and the ending was too abrupt for me. But that aside, the filmmakers have done a masterful job translating the novel to the screen. I highly recommend it! --Syrie James",Jane Eyre
146,retrojester20,"Good version, but I'm still looking for the best.",8,24 January 2012,"I've been a fan of the Jane Eyre novel for years. I've read the book countless times, and practically have it memorized. I've seen almost ever film/TV adaption there is, and I can honestly say that this one is one of the best I've seen.Although there were a few lines from the book that were left out, the dialogue mostly stayed true to the original novel. I appreciated that a lot. Mia and Michael both played their parts wonderfully. I think they are the best actors to ever play Jane and Edward. Also, I think the looked the part of the characters.The only main disappointment I had with this movie is that they left the ending scene of the book out of it.

His portrayal of Fairfax Rochester is a lesson in acting. There are few actors who possess the mastery he brings to the screen. With so much as a faze, he pulls at your very soul and draws you into a world where the poetry of love and agony are interwoven inseparably. The location and music are sublime.

149,wessandrews,I hate this movie so much,1,23 January 2015,"OK so I watched this movie in English and it didn't make any sense, the story is really boring I mean every minute is another 60 seconds of monotony. I know a lot of you arrogant English scholars and pretentious hipsters aren't going to like this but this was just awful, the story is too confusing, she starts off as a kid and then is taken to some priests house and then there's a time skip. at this point it gets really boring and confusing, she becomes a teacher but then she quits or something like that, then she is working at Micheal Fassbenders house and its all good, then there's a fire (with NO explanation to why there is a fire I might add) and then Fassbender is about to marry the main character but it turns out he already has a wife, and his wife appears in the movie for about 2 minutes and is never heard from again. then they are in a field and there's a character called St David (not the saint of wales) is calling for her and she runs off, then the house is destroyed and a maid's ghost is there then Fassbender is blind and she looks at him and the movie cuts to black. That plot made no sense whatsoever. Everyone in my class agreed it was terrible. This film made it to the top 5000 how did it do that? The story is terrible, the acting is bland, the dialogue switches from 18th century English to 21st century English way to much. There are too many time-skips, half the events are just filler, the only fun I had watching this movie was making fun of it with my friends about how bad it was. Do not watch it",Jane Eyre

153,sofiapeeters,"The music captures the book perfectly, but not the rest",6,9 August 2020,"The thing is that the film wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. To me, it doesn't capture the book at all.
The plot is too fast paced, and I can understand that given that there is only so much you can put into 2 hours of a 500+ pages book. I liked that a lot of the original dialogue text was kept the same. The cinematography was pretty good. However, the characters weren't at all like the original book characters. Rochester is not as gloomy and dark as he is in the books, and Jane has none of the spirit that she has in the books. She comes off as just a bland character. Expressionless, lifeless, thoughtless, depressed... Very disappointed by that. The romance between Jane and Rochester had no real buildup in the film and was rather abrupt, followed by too rose-colored depicted relationship once they get together.
The only thing that really stood out to me was the score. The music was absolutely beautiful, the violin and piano, and captured the original content very well.
Overall I was left disappointed. I much rather prefer the 2006 bbc miniseries, in which the original characters and plot are really done justice.",Jane Eyre

From the the compression of the story to fit into a movie to the the choice of using flashbacks to tell half the story so much is missing from the plot. If I were not familiar with the book I fear this would be very confusing to the audience until a ways into the film. The casting is fair for the most part but nothing was outstanding sadly.

Just enough darkness surrounding him that made his mood more appealing. The ending was a bit abrupt IMO, but that's okay. The film is excellent. I've seen 3 different versions of Jane Eyre and I must say that I put this one neck/neck w/the 2006 version w/Toby Stephens. I can't pick one because they're both so good.

The music, the light - oh, the LIGHT in this film is so incredible, the actors - I can't see something disagreeing with Brontë's intentions.For sure the film specifically address a certain category of informed viewers and I doubt it will reach a commercial reputation.

158,talia-758-168602,Pretty but forgettable,8,21 September 2011,"Cary Fukunaga's Jane Eyre is beautiful to look at and exceptionally well-cast, but it's forgettable because it is afraid to do what it sounds like Andrea Arnold (in her upcoming adaptation of another Bronte sister novel) has succeeded at: delving deep into the source material on a thematic level to boldly explore the fear and desire inherent within the story. Jane Eyre the new film, even in its earlier moments, never makes a real impact; the book itself is unabashedly melodramatic, often sensational and Gothic to an extreme degree, yet restrained by its narrator's subdued yet steady and confident tone. Because Fukunaga's film focused more on atmosphere than on the interesting and complex themes within the story, the climax especially seems slight. It's a moderately enjoyable film, mostly because of Fassbender's performance and the nice cinematography, but it's a slimmed-down but unoriginal take on a very over-covered story.",Jane Eyre
159,esandell,This version sucks,2,22 January 2020,"This movie was a huge disappointment.The general atmosphere of the film is desolate. And it's not deliciously desolate and intriguing, but it gives the sort of empty feeling as looking down a central street of a mid-sized town lined with strip malls and ugly signs on a dreary gray April day. I was viscerally repelled by the tone set by this movie.The timeline of the film is not linear, but jumps around, starting with the scene where Jane flees Thornfield Hall after finding out that Mr. Rochester is already married. If you're not familiar with the story, it may be disorienting. The camera shots are awkward and choppy.The characters are flat. There is nothing of the humor or spunkiness, playfulness even, that's in the book. It is completely unbelievable that Jane and Mr. Rochester love each other.

161,tawade2326,Not Deep Enough,7,27 February 2012,"The main focus in this movie is the love story between Jane and Rochester, which is also the climactic adventure in the book. It is where Jane can escape a life of hardship and disappointment to find joy and peace. Indeed, this is the only relationship in the book that is explored beyond a shallow level.I do wish they had spent more time focusing on her schooling. I understand that many things have to cut out in the interest of time, but her schooling shapes her—both for better and for worse. This time period shapes Jane's personality and belief system. It would have been better for the audience's understanding of Jane to see more of her schooling and the development of her friendship with Helen. The audience would also benefit to see how the development of the school itself affects Jane's relationship with those within the school and the new schoolmaster. This too would have a grand effect on her schooling and, therefore, the rest of her life. SPOILER ALERTThey rushed the death of Helen Burns. There was not enough story behind their friendship. The movie makes it seem as though she just died of a bad cold. Nothing is explained of this sickness, and the audience is devoid of emotion in Helen's death because we do not see the depth of her friendship with the protagonist, Jane, other than two acts of kindness. This friendship Jane learned from Helen is indeed shown later on in the movie at Rochester's party:Rochester: You'd dare condemnation for my sake?Jane: For the sake of any friend who deserved it.This echoes a statement of friendship and companionship Jane undoubtedly learned from Helen while growing up. When all others left Jane to die and excluded her from their care, Helen reached out a friendly hand and helped her through the hardest times of her life. Rochester now asks Jane for that same kind of friendship. The use of flashbacks is very well done. Picking up the story in the middle-to-end of the book is a great strategy for a film based on a novel. This allows the audience to see where she is years down the road, gradually piecing together how she got there with flashbacks of her childhood, schooling, and work. However, I admit the chronology towards the end of the movie threw me off a bit. I was confused as to the timing of her arrival at St. John's home. Her reappearance at Thornfield after the fire has destroyed the place was confusing, as well. There is no true resolution to the movie, which assumes a knowledge of the novel to understand what happens next in Jane Eyre's life.",Jane Eyre
162,anitavonop,Timothy Dalton - Zelah Clarke can't be beat,5,19 March 2011,"The absolute best Jane Eyre is the miniseries with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton - great chemistry and plenty of airtime to truly do the story justice. Because the other versions are only 2 to 3 hours, none of them can truly develop the relationship between the two main characters as well as this version did. Most of the plot and dialog come directly from the book with only a few small changes. Some of the other versions totally change the story and do not improve it. Zelah Clarke was truly the shy young woman in this story - not beautiful until she knows love. This was pre-Bond for Dalton and he makes an excellent Rochester. Nothing can touch it.",Jane Eyre
163,fuu_5,One of the best but no the best,6,20 March 2011,"When I see the trailer I was so excited to see the movie that I keep tracking the first weeks of march to see when was coming out, and I was a little disappointed. The acting is great, Michael and Mia have a great chemistry, but I'm afraid Mia is to emotional for the character, I always imagine Jane more stoic, to me the best Jane is Charlotte Gainsbourg And they change a few things, like the Rivers being family and cutting the friendship with Helen, who teach her a few things like take things as they come, I know the novel is to big to make a 2 hour movie, but there are a few thing you can let out or change... like how they reunite in the end, with her bringing a glass of water and their hand touching again But I loved that they put the part when Jane hear Rochester call in the wind",Jane Eyre

Don't go.,8,22 March 2011,"I have not seen any previous film adaptations but love the story of Jane Eyre.My analysis about this film is that if you have not recently read the book...or you don't remember a lot about it...this film is not for you.The film does a good job at showing what it shows but it leaves the viewer to remember and fill in all the important things that it does not show. I went to see it with someone who'd not recently read the book and they didn't like the film at all because it glossed over so much history and left out a lot of details that they didn't remember themselves. If you have never read the book, don't go see this film because you won't understand what is going on at all. BUT if you want to see the middle-section of the book (Thornfield) acted out...it's pretty good.",Jane Eyre
165,ebelle21,Disappointed...Avoid If Possible,5,15 January 2012,"I saw that this movie was highly rated and I figured that it would be pretty accurate and good. I am a huge fan of the novel and I have read it many times, but I am yet to find a Jane Eyre movie that I like. The actors for Jane and Mr. Rochester have absolutely no chemistry, and they do a horrible job as the characters. The story flows funny, and everything is mixed up. I was hoping for them to portray his wife as more crazy, but she didn't seem as scary or freaky as she was in the book. If you have no idea about Jane Eyre and haven't read the book, then this version of the movie/book might confused you. I highly recommend reading the book and avoiding this version of it.",Jane Eyre
166,rooski85,Can't compare with other versions,4,3 April 2011,"I'm very surprised to read the glowing reviews this version of Jane Eyre is receiving. Like other reviewers, Jane Eyre is my absolute favorite book and so I've seen every TV/movie version of it starting with the Orson Welles version. I will agree that the scenery was gorgeous, but other than that, I was pretty disappointed. There's no way to condense this fantastic story into a two-hour movie and do it justice; there's just too much detail and when left out, it makes for a choppy retelling. While watching it, at first I kept ""filling in"" all the parts that were left out. Then I'd try to watch it as someone who had never read the book, but that left me too confused because of the speed at which the story was told, and the flashback retelling of the story.Also, this version has Jane becoming an heiress, but what about the fact that St. John and his sisters truly *are* Jane's relatives??? Her generosity to them wasn't just a nice gesture for taking her in when she showed up at their door.The ending completely irritated me. Jane and Rochester's reunion at the end was a second love story, and it received all of 1-2 minutes before cutting off.I also agree with other reviewers who didn't see/feel any passion between this Jane and Rochester. While I did like their looks for the parts, their scenes together felt like they were reciting lines, not falling in love with each other. And I didn't see any of the passion in Michael Fassbender that you could see with Timothy Dalton or Toby Stephens. If anything, he made me think that Daniel Day-Lewis would make for an excellent Rochester by bringing more depth to the character.All in all, I would recommend people to use their money to rent the Timothy Dalton or Toby Stephens version of this story vs. using it to attend this version.",Jane Eyre
167,nampak,Why remake if not to make it better?,3,11 April 2011,"I agree with many of the other reviews. Don't fix what's not broken. The 2006 Jane Eyre was the best and most moving adaptation of the book. The two main characters had great chemistry and you could see them falling in love. In this version, I was actually bored during the movie even though I adore this book and its love story. I was so disappointed. I never sensed that they were falling in love and when the 'big' scene came I felt nothing. I wonder if they even looked at the other versions to see what they were up against. If you're going to do a remake at least be daring enough to do something different. From the trailer, I thought it would be much darker, much scarier, much more... something! Instead, it was much less... something. As they say, 'there's nothing like a good romance movie and this was nothing like a...' you know the rest.",Jane Eyre
168,gingeralla24,excellent,10,3 October 2011,"it was incredibly deep, amazing movie, brilliant actors play, very intense emotions and feelings, mind blowing.I enjoyed every second of it, it was just breathtaking, the young actress played Jane Eyre surprised me with a very professional actings, and the main hero of the movie is the raw sexy masculine person,role model for men, i just fell in love with him, directors set was simply excellent, i have never seen such a dramatic yet sensitive movie, overall in the entire history of Jane Eyre movies-this is the best one. Incredibly passionate, tense and heart warming.I recommend to see this movie to everyone, it is the best love story since Wurthering heights.",Jane Eyre
169,junie-maupin,Jane Eyre 2006 vs. Jane Eyre 2011,5,29 August 2011,"This Jane Eyre version with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender definitely wasn't my favorite for various reasons. Waskikowska's performance seemed to be flat in almost every segment. I felt like she didn't truly represent Jane and seemed like she was lost in that sort of role. However, she did have a few, and only a few, good Jane scenes. Ruth Wilson; however, from the 2006 version accentuated Jane for what she was: passionate, calm, and peculiar. Compared to Wasikowska's performance, Wilson outmatched her in almost every way. Michael Fassbender, on the other hand, was fantastic. I believe he represented Mr. Rochester's dark and mysterious nature very well; however, I believe the performance of Toby Stephens was the best. Despite the actors, I thought the soundtrack for this film was fantastic. Kudos Dario Marianelli.",Jane Eyre
170,jenn-ballard-181-120710,terrible,1,8 October 2011,"No chemistry between the characters. The actress that played Jane Eyre might as well have been a corpse. A lot of the other characters were hardly even touched upon. Perhaps this is because there just was not enough time in a movie to do the book justice and a mini series would be better. Because there was so little chemistry and character development it does not make sense why Jane and Rochester are even getting married. He does not come across as dark or tormented, and she has none of the spark or feeling that made her the unmanageable child and strong adult of the book. The A&E version with Ruth Wilson was a much more watchable adaptation.",Jane Eyre
171,allykhady,Could have been a lot better-Spoiler alert,4,22 April 2012,"Having read the book many times since a young teenager, and having seen many many versions, screen and miniseries, the 2011 version disappoints. First, instead of repeating some scenes, film-time could have been used for really important missed elements, plus an extra 15 minutes would have also helped. Mia is truly lovely and one of my favourite young actress today, but her portrayal leaned too much to the 1-dimensional and stoic. The literary Jane is plain and poor, but she is extremely intelligent, spiritual and passionately drawn to and unwaveringly in love with Rochester. This film gives too few opportunities for us to see these elements. Most important: this movie does no justice to the tormented, lost, changeable, sardonic, kind, passionate, gentleman-boy-nobleman that is Rochester. Bronte is clear, fate knocked him about. She spends pages and pages, using literary devices, metaphors & dialogue to show the reader that Rochester was actually born to be the happier kinder 2nd brother, with talent and charm, raised with obligation to please his father & older brother. What fate thrust upon him caused his pain, roaming & moodiness, but it did not change his inherent nature: kindness, charm, dutifulness. It cost him 15 years of his youth, but he's really still that dutiful good young man forced to also be a maturing nobleman. Bronte created a Rochester & Jane that the reader wanted to draw out. The sensuality between them & their passion for life & each other constantly brimming at the surface, but held in check with pain & strict respect for convention. The book is clear that Jane herself was tormented & tempted before leaving Thornfield to break convention, her sexual passion & love for Rochester so overwhelming. Likewise, the book is also clear on Rochester's respect for strictness, convention, responsibility & duty.Its true a reader or viewer can worry in any version of the epic story that Rochester may be sexually harassing Jane in her employment. But in fact, Bronte makes it clear that both were tempted to break convention, that the love was mutual, deep & true. Though Jane is young, she is not woman who needs & wants flattery. She has found a man who loves her mind & soul. And Rochester, after roaming the world for a decade, finally finds the woman meant for him. She the one he yearns for intellectually, sexually, passionately and yet does not have to flatter her.In Bronte and so many film versions, it is true that some of what Rochester does is reckless in trying to draw Jane out & keep her near. But we learn & feel enough of his torment & conflict to know that he does not cross the line to sexual harassment. Unfortunately, Fassbender's portrayal did. My husband saw it in a couple scenes and eventually could not watch further. At one point, Fassbender even runs after Jane across the stone bridge & bounces around her awkwardly. These awkward elements could have been offset with more film-time on the growing nature of Jane & Rochester's mutual love, bond, respect & passion. These would have improved this film.Toby Stephens in 2006 was a surprisingly superb Rochester: the mature noble boy-gentleman, at once wicked & dutiful, yearning passionately for Jane while loving her for her mind & soul. Ruth Wilson was excellent in showing calm, intelligence, convention & love. And I like the way the 2006 version clearly established her as leader. the ending of that series made it clear that Wilson's Jane finally got absolutely everything she truly deserved. Timothy Dalton's Rochester in 1983 reigns supreme, giving everything Stephens gives, but with slightly more austerity & sardonit wit. And when he approaches Jane in the garden, he sits far away from where she is standing, his eyes full & glistening with his own fear, torment & trepidation. Respecting her space, Dalton' Rochester begins to speak to Jane calmly, yearningly & deeply......the effect of his Rochester on hundreds if not thousands of women can't be underestimated.Read the book, watch these 2 versions.",Jane Eyre
172,rat-race-escapee,The best of the two-hour versions. And better than some of the longer ones.,9,12 November 2013,"Jane Eyre is my favorite novel of that period. It surpasses all the Jane Austin stories. So many earlier versions of this film have been disappointing. Until now, it seems to have been impossible to make a film of this story in less than two hours. Unless you are going to do a 4-6 hour mini-series, this is the best of the two-hour versions. They cut out the unnecessary stuff (Miss. Temple, the Rivers cousin connection, the Gypsy woman fortune-teller), but they kept the important. Just. loved. it. bye the way, Jane's faith in God was diminished. Hollywood, even the east annex in Britain, just cannot give glory to God and the Deus ex Machina that occurs in the story.

173,yura-polo,Terrible version of a classic work,1,8 July 2012,"I have read reviews that commented on many aspects that are horrible about the movie: lighting, acting, chemistry among the cast. All of these bad comments are richly deserved by almost everything in the movie. I just want to comment about one main thing that is missing in this so called adaptation of the great book. It is the strength of the spirit and passion. Everyone you meet in the book has both of these qualities. They are present through the way characters act and interact, the thoughts they think, the choices they make, the feelings they posses. The story takes place in England at a more traditional time, written by one of humanity great authors. For that reason the book has depth that must be captured by a movie to be successful. To people who can not identify with spirit and passion in the book it will seem arid. It is obvious how the director and actors perceived the book if they have read it at all. This movie have squeezed the life out of great literary work creating a shallow spasmodic ghost story locking any kind of depth.",Jane Eyre

No-one is given time with characters to connect any emotion to them.

175,nekonee,Lacking in many ways!,3,6 September 2012,Jane Eyre is one of the best books I have ever read and this movie does no justice to the book's details and characters. I was very disappointed because you do not get the feel for the characters and the story behind each of them.I can see how it would be hard to capture the book in it's entirety in a two hour movie but some of the best parts and little details were left out which really upset me.I would not watch it again. I would not recommend it to anyone. I would much rather read the book or try a different adaptation. But rarely ever do books make good movies.,Jane Eyre
176,kmarshall1331-540-293530,Dark Tale of Mistreatment and Betrayal,5,27 November 2012,"*****SPOILER ALERT***** A review from a Christians perspective: Jane Eyre (2011) carried out basic elements of plot, however it lacked a clear resolution. Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre was a perfect match. Her performance truly took you back in time. The set was over the top and the symbolic tree added to the plot. The costumes were appropriate for the time period but not dazzling. I understand shes ""Plain Jane"" but cant her wedding dress have more pizazz? Some of what goes on in the movie goes against the Bible, but was just how the time period was. There were forms of child abuse and a lack of Christ-like love for the children in the orphanage which added to the plot and made your heart yearn for Jane. The way the teachers handled repentance was extreme, but sinners should repent. I do not recommend this movie unless you like the book. I find the overall thing dark, gloomy, and very dreary. If you like the book, you may be a bit disappointed because the lack of a resolution. If you choose to watch it, know there is a little light at the end of the tunnel.",Jane Eyre
177,ninica1111,What did I just watch?!,1,16 February 2021,"So I finished the book today, so my memory of it is very fresh, and I was looking forward to finishing up the whole experience by watching the movie adaptation. Okay, maybe it was too soon, it can never be like the book, but this is just one bloody disaster. First of all, movie wouldn't make any sense to anyone who hasn't read the book, it would be just a bunch of incomplete, randomly put scenes, with people you don't know and what they are doing there and what the hell is even happening.
The movie starts in the middle of the book, and the first part is showed as a memory, but then when the memory gets to the middle part where the movie started, they just play the same scene from the beginning again for a few minutes. And its just Jane running through the field and crying. Why??? They usually say there is not enough room in a movie to portray everything that's happened in the book, but why waste this precious time like this??
Then, 90% of the movie are recreated conversations from the book, that are pretty accurate, somewhere even word to word, but then BOOM, they just put something that has never happened in the book. Why again?? It didn't make the conversation better, au contraire. Like the first time Jane and mr Rochester met, when he fell of the horse, they completely changed that, and many other significant conversations and events.
Much attention was spent on irrelevant things, and no attention to big parts and characters of the book.
Everything is pale, including Jane, scenery, clothes... no color anywhere.
Im very disappointed, I just lost two hours of my life and almost spoiled an amazing classic. I say almost because I'm gonna try my best to forget I ever watched this.",Jane Eyre

It portrayed the characters well (except that Rochester was more attractive than described in the book) and the acting was quite good. It left out a few important characters and plot revelations and added some Hollywood theme, but overall it was pretty accurate. They did a great job of generalizing the important parts of the book and making the plot flow. Overall, would recommend. I liked Rochester better in the movie than in the book. Even if you don't like historical fiction, I would try to watch it.",Jane Eyre
179,elysemichellew,very disappointing,2,1 January 2016,"Jane Eyre is a story that is very near and dear to my heart. The first time I ever experienced JE, I watched the 2006 Toby Stephens version with my mother, when I was around 12/13. I was dazzled by that version. The scenery was beautiful, it had a kind of spooky feeling, the story was intriguing, but what got me hooked on Jane Eyre was the relationship between Jane and Edward.In the 2006 version, Stephens and Wilson are passionate, and they convey so much through their exchange of glances and subtle expressions. The delivery of the lines is fantastic, and so much feeling. Wilson does a perfect job of displaying Jane's passionate and romantic nature, while also showing her inner strength and clear sightedness. Toby Stephens was an excellent Rochester. You could see how tortured he was, and he was amazing at going from charming and pleasant one second, to brooding and rude the next.After the 2006 version, I read JE, and got wrapped up in the book too! After years of loving the book and the 2006 version, I decided to expand my horizons and watch other adaptations. I watched the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, and I loved that one too. It comes in close second to the 2006 version. Timothy Dalton was excellent, and Zelah Clarke was pretty good. In my humble opinion not as good as Ruth Wilson, but still. when I watched both the 1983 version and the 2006, I felt I was watching the book come to life before my eyes, like I was really seeing Jane and Rochester as they were meant to be seen.With 2011 version, I was so let down. A few points of the movie were okay, mostly I didn't like it. The scenery was fine. I've read some reviews saying how much they loved the ""Gothic"" feeling of the movie, but I have to disagree. Visually, the film looked Gothic, but it didn't have that same creepy FEELING that I got watching 2006. JE is supposed to be sort of Gothic, but it's also very colourful and vibrant at points. This film seemed like it was trying too hard to be creepy and haunting, and instead ended up feeling very dull. I thought Fassbender's Rochester was interesting. He was good at being brooding, and not bad to look at. Many people complain that he was too good looking for Rochester, which is true, but whenever you get an adaptation of Jane Eyre, especially a more modern one, it's pretty much a given that Rochester is going to be too handsome. I thought there were some moments where Fassbender did well, and I think if he had had a better script, his Rochester could've turned out better.Things I felt were wrong...:Rushed storyline. The whole plot of the movie felt like a project done by an English student who didn't read the book, and just read the cliff-notes. Important scenes were cut, and dialog was choppy, and I found myself muttering lines that should've been included. AND THE ENDING. It felt like Pride and Prejudice 2005 all over again. The epilogue, that's the best part, with some of the most emotional scenes!! They completely butchered it, trying to go for a dramatic ending that fell flat. They really screwed Jane and Edward's relationship. JE is first and foremost, a story about love, passion, and equality. Wasikowska and Fassbender failed to deliver the passion and emotion that was needed in their characters. I feel this wasn't entirely their fault. The script was lacking, and they didn't have much to work with. Also think the director, or whoever was telling them how to act in each scene didn't know what they were doing. There were moments during the movie, where we saw a little bit of passion. The scene after the ""wedding"" where Rochester is pleading with Jane to stay, they did alright in that scene. You could see what could've been, if the script had been longer and better.I also felt that with the rushed storyline, the love between Jane and Rochester didn't seem real. With the proposal scene, it felt like the movie was saying, ""Yep! He loves her now. This makes sense!"" It wasn't authentic. In other versions of JE, Rochester is fascinated by Jane. You see them develop friendship, and you see them fall in love. SLOWLY. The reason Rochester has the house party with Blanche at Thornfield is to try and make Jane jealous. At this point he is already in love with her, and is sure he wants to be with her. He is trying to see if Jane wants him back. The 2011 version feels like by the point Blanche arrives, Edward and Jane don't really know each other.They cut out Jane being related to St. John, Diana and Mary, which was an important part of the story. The whole reason Jane gave them all some inheritance was because she didn't want the money as much she wanted family. And also, she felt they were entitled to it as they were related to the uncle as well. THE FORTUNE TELLER SCENE. I was upset about that being cut out.Grace Poole is just completely out of the picture??I was also very mad about the bed fire scene. This is supposed to be a frantic scene. Jane and Rochester were too calm trying to put out the flames. They were just like ""Oh no, a fire. We'd better put that out. Wow.""I have more things I didn't enjoy, but this is too long. To finish, if you want a good quality adaptation of Jane Eyre, watch the 1983 version, or the 2006 version. I would recommend the 2006 version first, because it's my favourite, but the 1983 version was great too. Or you could watch them both!",Jane Eyre

181,awada-1,good film but felt like cliff notes version (spoilers ahead),8,12 March 2011,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a hardcore Bronte devotee, obsessed with the book, and have seen pretty much every filmed version out there. I really enjoyed the film- acting, cinematography, costumes, etc. I loved Mia and Michael- awesome together, good chemistry, making an excellent Jane and Rochester. My main criticism would be that there were several key scenes that were omitted, primarily between when Rochester and Jane meet and when he proposes, which kind of gives short shrift to their relationship. They don't really have time to establish the bond that makes their relationship so powerful, so that it comes slightly out of left field when they confess their love to each other. Many other omissions make this feel like the Cliff Notes version, and my movie companion was left missing a lot of the magic and nuance because he hasn't read the book and was confused by some of the leaps and bounds the film made.The pivotal scenes that have been cut (which are shown in the trailer) are vital to the story, and I'm left wondering why they were dropped. But then that's a major pet peeve of mine: If a scene doesn't make it into the movie, don't put it in the trailer! Argh! It always feels like false advertising to me. But anyways, back to the positives...The scenes between Jane and Rochester feel pretty electric. Jane is sharp as a whip, which is right on target. In my opinion, the best thing about this movie is that they FINALLY showed the scene portrayed in Chapter 27, which is my absolute favorite chapter which they never do justice to in the films. They even included the ""I could bend her with my finger and my thumb"" line, where a desperate Rochester notes that he could physically force Jane to submit to his will, but he still wouldn't control what he cherishes most: her soul. In the film, it felt somewhat natural and organic, too, which is a hard thing to pull off. Loved it! Also, showing Rochester bursting into Jane's room the morning after, frantic to discover Jane is gone-- awesome! It's so much better than Rochester impotently watching Jane walk away, which is what some other film versions have done.The ending is romantic but abrupt-- I like more closure to my happy endings, and Jane and Rochester need more happiness after a lifetime of misery.Final critique- by switching up the chronology, you don't meet Rochester until halfway through the movie, and he's sort of the fire of the piece. Without Rochester, there's not much story, and I think the film would've benefited by introducing him a little earlier.Loved that Rochester puts his pants on AFTER he and Jane put out the fire. I'd always wondered if he was fully dressed...",Jane Eyre
182,hinalshahus,I so wanted to give the movie a 10 out of 10,8,28 March 2011,"So finally Jane Eyre opens in a 'select theater' near me and this past Saturday afternoon, I drove 50 miles (roud trip) to watch it on the silver screen. The verdict is...I left the movie theater feeling rather underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, the acting was superb. Mia's Jane is small, plain and fierce. Fassbender's portrayal of Rochester is brilliant, his beautiful voice and excellent delivery of dialog engaged the audience every time he appeared on the screen.What it is then that would not make me give the movie 5 out of 5 stars? I believe the movie was several shades too subtle- to the point that ( for me) it did not allow its characters to shine through as much as they could and should have. Adele had none of the charm that is so endearing in the book and Helen dies without giving the audience any reason to mourn her tragic end. Blanche appears on the screen and when you blink she is gone. Bertha was given even less screen time. The characters that I mention are not fluff pieces in the novel- they are vital to the story but in the movie they just flutter though without leaving much impression. My two major disappointments were parts of the movie that showed when Rochester brings Jane to Bertha's lair ( after their botched wedding ceremony) and the last scene when Jane comes back to her blind lover. They could have been so much more stronger!! The conventional wisdom is that 1996 movie with William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg was no masterpiece but I have to say the 1996 version far beat the 2011 version as far as Jane Eyre's childhood was concerned. On the other hand, the 1996 version completely butchered the part of the story when the Rivers siblings make their appearance where as in the just released version the trio is given their just due.I have to add one more thing- I believe my lack of enthusiasm for the movie also results from the experience of watching it along with 350+ people in the cinema. I know that not everybody is a die heart Jane Eyre fan and desires to listen to every word spoken and evry sigh exhaled but I cringed every time the audience laughed. It was okay to do so when Jane made a specially witty rebuke to Rochester's teasing but come on laughing at Mrs. Fairfax's facial expression when she sees Jane and Edward kissing the night he proposed !? It was as if the mood in the theater was, dammit! it is a fine Saturday afternoon and I want to have me some fun, I've just spent $10 on the ticket and though the movie is serious and dark I am going to get my entertainment value by crackling at every scene that is remotely off beat.I think once I have a chance to watch it in the privacy of my home I will be more drawn in and will appreciate it much more.",Jane Eyre
183,georgiaroberts-73669,Modernly wonderful,9,28 June 2018,"Unlike other adaptations that focus solely on the Victorian era, this gives a more modern twist on the classic tale of Jane Eyre. I feel like this is exactly what I saw in my head as I read the novel. Mia Wasikowska's performance is superb, she embodies all of the characteristics I associate with Jane. The fire scene (my favourite in the novel) between her and Michael Fassbender is captivating and real. The gothic element of the novel is also widely explored and showcased especially in this adaptation which I love because it's such a huge theme of the novel, which isn't as explored as much in the other films where they usually focus on the Romance theme.

184,annemzuch,Dull,4,10 November 2021,"I can scarcely believe the high ratings for this newer version. This has got to be the dullest and most emotionally stunted version made. Also, nearly all of the female characters, save Judy Dench, look to be not more then 16 years old.The actress who plays Jane can hardly work up enough believable emotion to express her thoughts, given what her character has supposedly been through. Even the character of Richard Mason didn't look old enough to sprout facial hair. Seriously, WHAT was the director and producer thinking??You want a great Jane Eyre version with some hair on its chest and emotion to draw you in as well as some great chemistry between actors, then watch the Timothy Dalton version.",Jane Eyre
185,tovehindso,Could have been done way better.,3,26 November 2019,"First of all they picked terrible scenes to tie this together. If you havent read the book it will be confusing and if you have read the book it will only be annoying.
As for Fassbenders preformance (I usually like him as an actor) it was stiff and felt like he was reading aloud. This in contrast to Wasikowskas outstanding and heartfelt preformance made the mix very weird and out of balance.If you have read the book I do NOT recommend that you watch this film.",Jane Eyre
