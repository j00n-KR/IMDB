0,Leofwine_draca,"Revenge done right, on a low budget",7,20 August 2016,"This was the film which helped to kick start the entire post-apocalyptic wave of films which swept the world in the early '80s along with the sequel. Director George Miller uses every penny of the admittedly low budget to really deliver us the goods when it comes to action. There are lots of chase sequences and crashes, both motorbikes and cars. The large cult following is mainly down to the various high-powered vehicles on show, especially the special nitro-fuelled super car that Gibson uses at the end of the film to track down the enemies.However I was surprised at the pacing of the film. It starts off well but things slow down a little in the middle, with not much happening at all. For instance, Gibson actually only becomes 'mad' right at the end of the film, for fifteen minutes, and half an hour is taken up with unnecessary dialogue and scene building with unimportant characters. It's not bad but not gripping either; I guess Miller was still learning the ropes. The plot is nothing new, and the futuristic setting only serves to make a little difference from the old revenge theme, used so much in Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson, and films with about a hundred other action stars.The acting is all amateurish on the part of the biker gang, and real bikers were actually used as extras. The main baddie just seems too soft to be really scary, although the unusual characters are interesting to watch. I suppose that with Gibson being the only 'name' star (and he wasn't back then, either), the acting is forgivable. At least it's adequate and the actors and actresses acquit themselves with their respective parts well. Gibson, who went on to become a huge success with the LETHAL WEAPON films, is good in the part of Max, and it's surprising to see (well, hear) how strong his Aussie accent was back then.The film is worth watching due to the eccentricity of the characters. MAD MAX is full of oddball people, familiar to viewers of low-budget cult Australian films like RAZORBACK and DEATH WARMED UP. The comedy aspect is also high, with lots of laughs and jokes thrown in with the action. However action fans should go for MAD MAX 2, as it serves up a lot more action a lot more satisfyingly. I found this film to be not as good as I'd hoped, but different enough to be interesting, and the revenge formula certainly works despite the obvious budgetary constraints.",Mad Max
1,SnoopyStyle,fun action B-movie to the Max,8,3 December 2014,"It's a dystopian future 'a few years from now'. A group of cops Main Force Patrol maintain the law on the roads in the wastelands of Australia. Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) is the best of them all. It's a vision of violent social decay in the near future where anything goes. A biker gang descends on the area wrecking havoc. They rape and brutalize a young couple. Johnny the Boy is too high to leave the scene and is arrested. When nobody is willing to testify, he is let off. The gang attacks the cops and even Max's family. Enraged, he seeks revenge on the bike gang.This is simply a fun action movie. The car chases and stunts are visceral and powerful. There are explosions, car wrecks, and motorcycle crashes. It's a gear head's fantasy. There is an outsider cool vibe about this movie even today. It also introduced Mel Gibson to most of the world. It reminds me of other biker movies like 'The Wild One' except more violent with better action. It is grotesque in the best sense. The avenging Mad Max doesn't stop.",Mad Max
2,Horst_In_Translation,How much can one man suffer?,6,9 October 2015,"""Mad Max"" is an Australian movie from over 35 years ago and it was the big breakthrough for Mel Gibson, here in his early 20s. The multi talented artist that becomes 60 next year has starred in an uncountable number of films since then, won many awards, including 2 Oscars for ""Braveheart"", and was among Hollywood's biggest names until his demise a while ago. Gibson is probably among the biggest Australians in film history, just like Mad Max is one of the most known Australian films. The writer and director is George Miller and he has a pretty unique body of work. Mad Max is maybe his most known work, but if not, then it would be the animated penguin movie ""Happy Feet"", for which he also won an Academy Award. Miller turned 70 this year, so he was in his mid-30s when he made ""Mad Max"" and just this year, he returned to the franchise and made a really successful (with audiences and critics) new installment called ""Fury Road"". The title character is not played by Gibson anymore, but instead Tom Hardy took over. At least Gibson played him in the 2 sequels back in the 1980s.But back to this movie here: It is not very long, only 90 minutes without credits and has Gibson play a police officer in a world run by crime and vicious motorbike gangs. One of these is lead by the mysterious Toecutter and he is also the main antagonist in the movie. They keep committing crimes all the time, rob people, murder other people, rape women etc. Ruthless criminals. Things get personal quickly. When a fellow police officer who tried to arrest them is almost killed and mutilated for life by the gang, Max decides to retire from the force before his anger drives him either mad or makes him a criminal as well. But the suffering isn't over as the next targets of the gang are Max' girl and their child. This is too much for him and his bloody, ruthless revenge cannot be stopped anymore and in the last 15 minutes, he really unleashes on the bad guys. No mercy. All in all, a pretty good atmospheric movie with no real moments of greatness nonetheless. Still, I recommend it and it got me motivated to watch the sequels soon perhaps and also the new movie. Thumbs up.",Mad Max
3,Prismark10,When Max when Mad,7,28 May 2015,"Mad Max started out as a low budget post apocalyptic adrenaline pumped car chase and revenge film set in the Australian outback.However Max only becomes mad in the last 15 minutes of the film as he takes vengeance on the attack on his family.I have watched Mad Max periodically over the last 30 years. I originally watched an old and scratchy rental VHS tape with dubbed US voices.I recently watched a spruced up version with the original Australian voices which is much better. However do note that Mad Max was always a low budget film there is only so much you can do to improve the picture and soundtrack quality.Mel Gibson in what literally is the role that made him an international star is Max Rockatansky, a hard boiled cop with the fastest car chasing gang of ruthless and scuzziest motorcycle bandits that kill, rape and pillage.We initially see the Police chasing the drug fuelled Night Rider who causes a rampage and this sets the scene for the rest of the film. Its Max with little dialogue who stops the Night Rider but this brings the cops in a clash with the Toecutter the leader of the motorbike gang.The Toecutter is one of the vilest bad guys in tail end of 1970s cinema. His gang has no moral centre and there misdeeds keeps the film pumping. I did say the film is low budget. Director George Miller after the opening action scenes does a misdirection, he lets the film settle down but keeps the audience spooked as the Toecutter and his gang terrorise various townsfolk.Meanwhile Max's best friend, Goose is literally cooked which leads Max to quit the police and move out further to the country with his wife and child but fate delivers him to the Toecutter. In a sense very little happens until Max's wife is in danger from the gang and then Max goes for revenge.This is a taut action nasty made on a shoestring budget. It is very much a Grindhouse type flick that also happens to be part of the Australian New Wave cinema. A youthful Mel Gibson delivers Max as iconic from his very first scenes. He has little dialogue, it is left to Steve Bisley as Goose to deliver the laughs at first.However the film gets colder and nastier as it goes on. This is a dystopian society and the film also introduces elements such as the fuel shortage as a fuel tanker being attacked which will be dealt with in the sequel.However the film has a sense of camp as well. Too much leather for one, the police boss looks like a bald wrestler who delivers cheesy lines like they were written by Vince McMahon and some of the acting and editing of the film is far from polished.",Mad Max
4,claudio_carvalho,A Hero is Born in a Classic Action Cult-Movie,9,2 October 2005,"First time I saw ""Mad Max"" in the movie theater, I was astonished with this film, considered very violent for the standards of 1979. Maybe it was the first successful Australian movie in Brazil, a hero was born and everybody wanted to know who the completely unknown actor Mel Gibson was. Later, this movie was released on VHS, also very successful in the rentals. Last month, Warner finally released ""Mad Max"" on a very poor DVD in Brazil, without any extras, and I have just watched and liked again, after twenty-six years. So my conclusion is that ""Mad Max"" is a classic action cult-movie, isn't it? My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Mad Max""",Mad Max
5,kosmasp,No Dub for you,6,19 May 2015,"Let me say this first: Make sure not to watch the English Dubbed version of the movie! The original audio (also on the Blu Ray and DVD and hopefully on any future format) is Australian English and while you might have a few issues understanding a word or two (due to pronunciation) do not under any circumstances mistreat your ears to the horrible job they did with dubbing this.Having said that, also bear in mind that this is low budget 1979! Though while people think that product placement came a lot later in the (movie) game, we have some here! You might not notice the coke can in the back of a car, the first time you watch the movie, but you will unconsciously for sure. Very subtle and almost ""evil"".The small budget can be seen in the technology used (not gonna for ""hairstyles"", which are horrible for the most part). This is supposed to be the future ... A look at the ""cars"" and other things (phone booths!) are as the movie itself more than dated. I had to mention all those things, because they might not allow some people to have fun with the whole experience.Overall it's a decent effort, though most of the stunt work is being done very early in the movie and there seems to be big part/chunk of it that feels like it's filled up, to have a 90 minute movie (more or less). There is a few things that don't make sense or characters that appear just to disappear again (maybe they planned on having them back for a sequel, hard to tell).It's a beginning of a character (nice introduction though almost overplayed of not showing Mel Gibson) who has a sidekick who seems at least as interesting (and to a degree more ""mad"" than Mad Max himself) as our main character. Unfortunately there is not much of character development there. But it's a Mel Gibson vehicle, right? (no pun intended) Not very successful in America (due to the dubbing) they still went on and made a second one ... which I will get to in a second. A good movie that hasn't aged well is what we have here, but still worth watching if you can overcome all the flaws",Mad Max
6,classicsoncall,"""They say people don't believe in heroes any more.""",6,20 December 2015,"Sometimes it takes me a few decades to get around to pictures that everyone raved about back in the day and continue to have a reputation as landmark classics. I haven't seen any of the films in this franchise so figured it's about time to give the original a try. Sadly underwhelming. In addition to being startled by Mel Gibson's youthful appearance, I just couldn't get over the rather amateurish way the story was brought to the big screen. Still heralded as a futuristic look at a dystopian, apocalyptic society following a nuclear catastrophe, I couldn't reconcile that idea with the rather normal looking Australian countryside that the story took place in. By all appearances, Max Rockastansky (Gibson) and his family looked average middle class, and the biker gang pretty much fit the profile of your every day sleaze-ball thugs on motorcycles. I did get a kick out of the character names though, you won't find many pictures with a Goose, a Mudguts or a Toecutter. Mad Max's final revenge was rather sweet too; after hitting the oncoming semi, Toecutter wasn't half the man he used to be.",Mad Max
7,gavin6942,More Than a Cult Classic,8,20 November 2011,"In a dystopian future Australia, a vicious biker gang murder a cop (Mel Gibson)'s family and make his fight with them personal.""Mad Max"" is, without a doubt, a cult classic and a great showcase for Mel Gibson's talents (and proof that he does, indeed, have some). To think of it as merely a cult classic with little else behind it is a serious mistake. This is the unlikely role that launched Gibson to stardom, and kicked off the long-held notion that he is Australian. He landed the role completely by accident, not even trying out but simply looking the part after fighting ""half a rugby team"".What we really have here is a western disguised as science fiction. The science fiction aspect is actually so thin, though, that one could easily look past it if they were not into that genre. Besides being set in the future, there is really nothing sci-fi about it. Yet, if we replace the motorcycles with horses, we have a classic western revenge flick. And seen in that light, this is not only a classic but a masterpiece.The blood and gore take on a more realistic tone than many films, and that may well be because director George Miller had been a practicing physician before turning to film. Although Miller has directed all four Mad Max films, he has had some unusual detours, too: ""Babe"" and ""Happy Feet"", for which he won an Oscar.George Miller wanted a Gothic, Bernard Herrmann type score and hired Brian May (1934-1997, not the Queen guitarist) after hearing his work for the Australian cult film ""Patrick"" (1978). His work for ""Mad Max"" is his most well known, and lead to him getting numerous jobs in cult films, including such titles as ""Freddy's Dead"" and ""Dr. Giggles"".Shout Factory went all out with their blu-ray release of ""Mad Max"". There is an excellent audio commentary with the art director, cinematographer and special effects crew. We also have two featurettes, with one focusing on the film and the other on Mel Gibson. These were probably on the MGM release. But along with that, we have improved picture (1080p high=definition widescreen) and some great new interviews with Gibson, Joanne Samuel and DP David Eggby.",Mad Max
8,lee_eisenberg,An action movie from Australia?,4,26 December 2005,"OK, so now that we know Mel Gibson as the guy from ""Braveheart"", the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, and as the director of a certain movie about Jesus, what more can we say about ""Mad Max""? People know that it casts him as a cop in post-apocalyptic Australia out to get a biker gang who murdered his family. It's not a bad movie, but how many movies can there be about someone going after the people who murdered his family (granted, that's what I would do)? And anyway, aren't Australian movies supposed to be a little more serious than that? Most of the Australian movies that I've seen certainly were. I guess that this movie is OK as a reference (a before-they-were-famous situation for Mel Gibson), but there's not much to it otherwise. On another note, Mel Gibson seems to have had his face done since then (and Jodie Foster called him ""to the right of Attila the Hun""). What a world.",Mad Max
9,jboothmillard,Mad Max,7,20 September 2007,"The star of the Lethal Weapon films and Braveheart became an instant star from this low budget romp, and rightly so, especially being only his second film, from director George Miller (The Witches of Eastwick, Babe: Pig in the City). Basically, set in the wastelands of Australia in a dystopic future, society is in decay, oil supplies are near exhausted and law and order is breaking down. Vicious violent biker gang member Crawford 'Nightrider' Montizano (Vincent Gil) has murdered a cop's family and escapes police custody stealing the vehicle of a killed officer. In a high-speed chase, going up against him and bringing justice, is top Main Force Patrol (MFP) driver 'Mad' Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), and this dangerous confrontation results in the Nightrider being killed in an explosion, and a number of officers were injured in it. Max, who thinks nothing of the situation, is warned by the police chief that the bandits of the biker gang will be after him for killing Nightrider. Leading the gang is Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who plans to avenge the death, by killing MFP officers, and young protégé Johnny the Boy (Tim Burns) traps Max's close friend and fellow officer Jim Goose (Steve Bisley) and burns him alive. The gang then target Max's wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel) and baby, she tries to escape with the child, with the help of a friend, but the car stalls on the road, shotguns are not enough to stop them, Max is distraught after finding Jessie and the baby run over and dead. The last scenes see Max get his revenge against the biker gang, he suffers a bullet through the leg, and his right arm is run over by a bike, but he kills them all, apart from Johnny the Boy, who he holds up at the side of the road. Max sets a dilemma for Johnny, to make him either cut through his limb to escape, or be blown up, he is blown up and Max rides away to an unknown place deep in the outback. Also starring Roger Ward as Fifi Macaffee, Geoff Parry as Bubba Zanetti, Paul Johnstone as Cundalini, John Ley as MFP Officer Charlie and David Bracks as Mudguts. Gibson gives a good gritty performance as the lawman driving around on his motorbike taking the law almost into his own hands, the chase sequences are terrifically gripping with all the crashes, stunts and explosions going on, and the story is just about simple enough to grasp, the revenge element being key, it is a most watchable futuristic action adventure. Mel Gibson was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and number 17 on The 100 Greatest Movies Stars. Very good!",Mad Max
10,rmax304823,Dx: Hyperkinesis.,5,14 September 2013,"I can understand why this movie has such an ardent following. It's pretty innovative -- to the point of being experimental. It zips along at warp speed. When assorted, ornate vehicular contraptions aren't zooming along the flatlands of Victoria, everyone is shouting at everyone else, sometimes in accents decipherable only to the natives. The director has used lenses that make the vast expanses even more expansive and ever vaster.There's one vehicle wreck per minute. Either a pick up gets chopped to pieces by a horde of howling madmen or a scarlet car with yellow flames flips over and explodes. Everyone dresses in black leather outfits, but you can tell the good guys from the bad guys because the bad guys are utterly filthy, covered with dust and grease, while the good guys are a youthful Mel Gibson. And whatever they're paying the stunt men, it's not enough.I didn't sit through the entire affair. I was exhausted and breathless after forty-five minutes and I felt I was on the brink of an acute infraction of the myoculinary. The kettle drums thunder, the brass underscores the crises, the whining roar of the Pratt & Whitney J58-P4 engines turn the human tympanum into still another drum.Also, not being a car freak didn't help a bit. And let's face facts: those of us who already suffer from ontological Angst don't really need an adrenalin rush.Good luck -- and good hunting, mates.",Mad Max
11,Tweekums,The low budget Aussie film that started a major franchise and launched the career of Mel Gibson,7,26 January 2017,"Set in a not too distant future where law and order is breaking down and murderous biker gangs roam the roads of rural Australia in the search for thrills and fuel. Standing against them are the men of the Main Patrol Force. After 'Mad' Max Rockansky chases a gang member until he has a fatal crash the MPF find themselves targeted by the gang; they leave his partner, and best friend, horrifically burned and Max decides he has had enough. He heads off with his wife and child but their troubles are far from over; they run into the gang again with tragic consequences. With nothing left to lose Max hunts down the gang.The fact that this was a low budget film is pretty obvious although it works well with what it has. The motorcycle gang is suitably unpleasant although at times they play up their 'madness' just a bit too much. Mel Gibson does a solid job in the role that launched him as a major Hollywood action star and the rest of the cast are decent enough. No one will be too surprised at the general ways it ends but Max's final confrontation with one of the gang is one of the most memorable in any film and has been copied more than once. There is a degree of nastiness of course; the gang are cruel and the way Max treats that gang member is fairly sadistic even if few viewers will have any sympathy for him. Overall a solid revenge movie; just don't expect the large scale of the big budget sequels.",Mad Max
12,ma-cortes,Violent movie about a futuristic road-warrior cop with high-velocity action and kinetic energy,7,31 January 2010,"This classic is set a few years from now, a dangerous, desolate world of the future where rules the strongest law and useless Halls of Justice. It concerns about a police named Max (Mel Gibson), some cutthroats and revenge takes place. Max lives along with his wife (Joanne Samuel) and son. The nasties attack , rape, ravage to hapless and unfortunates. But vengeance will be terrible against some bands of depraved crazies thirsty for blood on high facility roads.This exciting picture packs kinetic action , thrills, chills, shocks and lots of blood and violence. Spectacular stunt-wok plenty of motorcycle races with bounds and leaps and explosions . Top-notch Mel Gibson as revenger angel at one of his first main roles, he embarks a criminal vendetta against vicious murderous. Rumbling and screeching musical score by Brian May. Special and weird futuristic atmosphere created by the cameraman David Eggby. The motion picture is stunningly directed by George Miller, author of the excellent post-apocalypse ¨Mad Max¨ trilogy along with the writer and producer Byron Kennedy. It's followed by ¨Mad Max 2, the Road warrior¨ with Gibson , Bruce Spence, Vernon Welles and Mike Preston ; and ¨Mad Max beyond Thunderdome¨ with Tina Turner, George Ogilvie, Frank Thring and again Bruce Spence. In addition, numerous imitations, rip offs, and exploitations ,especially Italians products. Rating : Good, better than average, this is the most successful Aussie movie of all time.",Mad Max
13,BA_Harrison,"If you don't like this, you're the one that's mad!",9,25 December 2009,"Believe it or not, but many years ago, Mel Gibson was cool. In fact, as leather-clad, shotgun-toting interceptor cop 'Mad' Max Rockatansky, he epitomised the word, patrolling the desolate roads of Australia, bringing the law to the lawless as society teetered on the brink of collapse.When his best friend Goose (Steve Bisley) is burnt alive by a vicious road gang led by the evil Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), Max decides to leave the force, believing that he is becoming as much of an animal as those he pursues; determined not to lose his best man, police chief Fifi (Roger Ward) dangles a carrot in front of Max in the form of a black, souped-up V8 Interceptor, and offers him a couple of weeks break with his family to reconsider his decision.But whilst Max is enjoying his holiday, the biker gang who toasted Goose turn up to cause trouble, eventually running down and killing the poor guy's wife and kid. More than a little upset, Max returns to work, takes his new car, and goes looking for revenge...As dystopian visions of the near future go, director George Miller's Mad Max is scarily believable, with life becoming increasingly perilous, and survival being dependant on being as ruthless as those around you. Of course, this is not the first film to present such a grim vision, but it is certainly one of the best, with Miller's superb, kinetic direction and the powerful performance from his enigmatic lead elevating this way above the competition.An iconic, adrenaline fuelled epic packed with twisted metal, screeching tyres, and roaring engines, Mad Max is absolutely unmissable entertainment for fans of raw, gritty, low-budget, cult action flicks.",Mad Max
14,moonspinner55,Action in a junkyard,5,7 January 2003,"George Miller co-wrote and directed this low-rent Australian variance of ""Death Wish"" set in the near future, with cop Mel Gibson seeking vengeance for the gang-related deaths of his wife and child. A mercilessly cruel, exploitive thriller overflowing with car crashes. The film certainly doesn't make Australia look attractive, what with the dusty, barren locales poorly photographed by David Eggby. The blubbering goons who litter the supporting cast were practically recycled for the film's two sequels, ""The Road Warrior"" in 1981 and ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" in 1985.

15,paul_haakonsen,Random clips put together doesn't make for a coherent movie...,3,24 August 2014,"I have nothing but fond memories of ""Mad Max"" from when I watched it as a young kid, about some 25 years ago or so. And I remember it as being a cool movie.Now, having revisited ""Mad Max"" in 2014, I must say that all of my childhood memories of the movie were breaking and shattering. This movie is nothing at all what I remembered it to be. It is abysmal. It is at best a collection of various segments of footage put together that doesn't overly have a very coherent storyline about it.And to make matters worse, then the acting in the movie is just painful to witness. Aside from Mel Gibson, then everyone else in the movie put on some really amateurish performances which didn't really add anything to the movie.Just goes to prove that memories is just that, memories. And sometimes it is better to let memories be in the haze of how you remember things to be.""Mad Max"" is a movie that is awfully thin on storyline, and even less so compelling. There is nothing dystopian or cataclysmic about the setting at all - perhaps that was in part two or three. I can't remember actually, and might have to revisit those as well.The dialog in the movie is keeping up with the rest of the movie, being incoherent and random. There is just no real flow to any of it.The music in the movie was equally random as the rest of the movie, and it was just too chaotic to have any sense of a proper movie score to it. The movie would have fared better with another score, of that I have no doubt.What I remembered to be a genre breaking movie and an outstanding movie back then was based on hazy childhood memories, because in reality ""Mad Max"" is not a memorable experience in any way.About halfway through the movie I had my mobile phone in hand and were checking Facebook updates. The movie was just that unappealing.A mere 3 out of 10 stars.",Mad Max
16,Quinoa1984,one of the riveting exploitation/biker movies of the 70s,9,1 October 2006,"Mad Max set off, at least in Australia, the careers of director George Miller and star Mel Gibson, and it's a very credible, hard-hitting low-budget work of B-movie craftsmanship. It's got some of the ingredients of more than a few biker movies of the late 60s and early 70s; a small-town biker gang with plenty of nasty personalities and psyches tear ass without a moral or care in the world. But these ingredients are mixed up with much more intense chases (sometimes with cars), attitude, and an anarchic future world where there's very little control of the law and justice has to be taken personally. It's got a tinge of the revenge movie in it too, though not until later on. I knew this, of course, from having seen the Road Warrior first. That film may possibly be very slightly better, or perhaps more accomplished and more compelling, but Mad Max ends up kicking up the ante on its low-budget cred, and its star cuts his teeth in a performance that isn't too shabby at all. There's an opening that ranks with the best action sequences in the Max series, as we get introduced to the (reluctant) hero by his prowess at scaring the pants off of 'the Night Rider' into his explosive demise. Then the villains get their due along with the cops, who really don't have as much personalities or full-on attitude (unlike in the Road Warrior), but still give off enough of a vibe that can mark them as the great one-dimensional antagonists of the picture. The premise is only this- to get away from the gangs that took a fellow cop on the force, Max Rockatansky (Gibson) takes his wife and little baby out on vacation. But the gang is still about, harassing the wife, and soon it leads to a very tragic and rough scene. From then on, Max dons his full-on leather look, plus a general look in his eye of desperation and un-yielding revenge, all in a take-no-prisoners super-car. All of this is done with a level of complete un-pretentious style, and it doesn't second guess its audience even with the typical 'talky' scenes.Gibson's Max here has twice the amount of lines that he had in the sequel, though in this film he is still partially less than mythic in stature. Thus it does add to his own crisis as a character- how does one fight these crazies on the streets without becoming crazy too? It all ends in a bang that feels less like a climax then a 'this will never end' kind of sequence of chasing and harsh death. In short, it's a pure-blooded exploitation flick, the kind that A.I.P.- who distributed the picture in the US- should have made as their marquee movie of the year. A-",Mad Max
17,Coventry,Outrageous Aussie Exploitation/Cult Classic!,10,2 July 2008,"Very few directors have the privilege to claim that their long-feature film debut both spawned an incredibly large and still ongoing number of imitations and promptly became the country of origin's biggest cult favorite of all time. George Miller's ""Mad Max"", as well as the sequels for that matter, may righteously be labeled as a true classic and  moreover  it's a genuine triumph for low-budget film-making and still definitely an inspiration for ambitious young directors nowadays. This film clearly didn't cost that much and the story is relatively simply (borrowing elements from 70's revenge flicks and road thrillers), but the atmosphere is seriously intense and the character drawings belong to the most unique I ever beheld. ""Mad Max"" takes place in the near future, even though the landscape and civilization appear to be everything but futuristic. Nothing regarding this ever gets mentioned, but the world clearly went through an apocalypse  perhaps a nuclear holocaust  because the roads are almost entirely forsaken and practically every building looks ramshackle. Max Rockatansky and his partner Goose work as policemen, but not the ordinary dull and by-the-book types of cops. When Max takes out an unhinged road-psycho called Nightrider, his crazed and dangerous biker friends come to town for retaliation. ""Mad Max"" is an almost indescribably grim and bitter film and these overruling depressing tones are undoubtedly what earned the solid cult reputation. The desolated exteriors and ominous silences contribute a lot to the sinister ambiance, but also the emotionless expressions on Max' face when he turns from happy Max into Mad Max! And yet, in spite of the aggressive tone and shocking plot events, the film actually features a remarkably small amount of explicit on screen violence. The suspense builds itself up towards an almost unbearable highpoint, through long fluent camera shots and empty sets, but the actual brutal stuff occurs off-screen. Presumably this was in relation to the lack of sufficient financial funds, but still, at least no one can blame George Miller for parading gratuitous violence. The acting performances aren't too spectacular, but Mel Gibson nevertheless depicts a likable lone anti-hero character and Hugh Keays-Byrne is a menacing (yet not overly absurd) villain. Absolutely recommended! I respect everyone's tastes and opinion when it comes to film, but whoever doesn't like ""Mad Max"" is so very wrong and simply has to reconsider!",Mad Max

19,hitchcockthelegend,Low budget classic that is now a genre landmark.,8,4 March 2008,"Set somewhere in the future we are privy to a world where the roads are ruled by maniac gangs with souped up cars, and bikers that literally could come from hell. Trying to stop these marauding loons are the overstretched police force who themselves ride in exceptionally fast cars. At the front of this story is Max Rockatansky, a good honest cop trying to hold his own against the chaotic world that is forming around him. After his best friend is burned and left for dead he decides enough is enough and thinks about retiring from the service, but whilst on a vacation with his wife and child things go decidedly bad and Max becomes an avenging force of fury with devastating affect.When evaluating this film I feel it really needs to be put into perspective just how brilliant a job director George Miller did with next to no cash to work with, in fact Miller edited the film in his own bedroom just to emphasise the low-fi nature of the beast. The costumes are excellent, the cast are terrific, with Mel Gibson as Max particularly impressive, and here we have villains to truly fit the word villainous, but it's the stunts and chase sequences that makes this film a rich rewarding experience. The opening ten minutes alone are pure adrenalin pumping genius, but the film as a whole delivers a crash bang wallop punch that has often been imitated since its release, but rarely bettered, and although the heart of the film is a simple revenge story, it grabs your attention and delivers right to the corking finale, 8/10.Footnote: Region 2 Users should note that the bargain bucket Mad Max Trilogy flip pack set still contains the foolishly dubbed version of this film, incredibly stupid move from the American distributors.",Mad Max
20,Hey_Sweden,Speed's just a question of money. How fast do you wanna go?,8,18 May 2015,"Visceral, powerful, and extremely influential, the original ""futuristic"", pedal to the metal action classic ""Mad Max"" is still very effective 36 years later. It proves that enormous budgets are NOT necessary to create this kind of entertainment, nor are overuse of special effects. It's all practically done stunt work and pyrotechnics that generate the thrills, not to mention the prospect of witnessing a prestigious film career in the making: Mel Gibson had his first big starring role here.Gibson plays Max, a highly efficient police officer in a desolate, decrepit Australia of the future. The roads are now regularly being dominated by gangs, all populated by adrenaline fueled crazies. After a while, Max becomes afraid that he is becoming just like the criminals whom he pursues, and elects to quit his job. But when tragedy comes knocking on his door, he's ripe for revenge - brutal, loud, high speed revenge.Hats off to the talented director George Miller. Judging by the reactions to his latest entry in this franchise, he's proving that he's still got what it takes, and that he fashioned an action movie model for many fans to follow. However, this delivers in more than one way, because the assortment of colourful characters (with names like ""Toecutter"" and ""Nightrider"" and ""Mudguts"") also make for good entertainment. Also, our protagonists are easy to identify with and likable. One can hardly blame Max's associate Jim Goose (Steve Bisley) for being dissatisfied with the system that fails to adequately punish miscreants like Johnny the Boy (Tim Burns). The stunts, art direction (by Jon Dowding), cinematography (by David Eggby), and music (by Brian May) are all extremely enjoyable.Gibson gives a creditable low key performance, displaying some of that charisma that would be part of his established screen persona. Joanne Samuel (as his wife), Bisley, Burns, and the great Roger Ward (as Max's boss) are fine in support. Hugh Keays-Byrne is fun as the primary antagonist, the gruff and burly Toecutter.""Max Max"" is on target from its gripping opening set piece to the moody fade-out.Eight out of 10.",Mad Max

22,poolandrews,Vastly overrated Australian futuristic action flick.,5,16 June 2008,"Mad Max is set in Australia in the near future where society is collapsing, gangs of vicious bikers roam the outback raping, stealing & killing to survive. The only law left is upheld by the Main Force Patrol, a hard as nails highway patrol who used supped up cars. Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) is an officer in the Main Force Patrol, after a high speed chase a known criminal & biker gang member called Night Rider (Vincent Gil) dies in an accident. The leader of Night Rider's gang Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) swears vengeance against the Main Force Patrol, after Max's friend Jim Goose (Steve Bisley) is burnt alive he quits the force but trouble soon catches up with him as his wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel) & young baby son are run down by Toecutter's gang. Driven over the edge Max sets out for revenge...This Australian production was co-written & directed by George Miller & having seen it several times over the years I have to say I think Mad Max is a vastly overrated action thriller that I have never really liked to any great degree. Many people consider it's sequel Mad Max 2 (1981) to be the better film & I echo that statement, in fact I would say Mad Max 2 is significantly better than this in every possible way. The script by Miller & James McCausland is supposedly set sometime in the future but apart from a run down police station there is nothing to indicate this at all, in fact I would say just looking at it Mad Max feels like it's set in the past & isn't the least bit futuristic at all. It certainly doesn't have anything approaching the bleak post apocalyptic feel of Mad Max 2. The actual story really isn't that good, Max as a character doesn't feature that much for the first half as the film has little focus & then by a string of tenuous coincidences his wife & baby are killed & he sets out for revenge as the film turns into a second rate Death Wish (1974) rip-off. This revenge part of the film doesn't feel that great, Max runs some bikes off the road & in that sense it's rather impersonal. The only time it becomes interesting is when he gives a biker the choice of either cutting his own foot off with a hacksaw or burning to death as the car he is handcuffed too explodes. The action is very sporadic, the opening car chase sequence is brilliant but then there's nothing else in the film that comes anywhere near close to emulating it which feels rather anti climatic.Director Miller does alright here, the opening car chase sequence is brilliant with some truly spectacular crashes. I also liked the little artistic touches during it as well, like when Goose gets a call about the chase a couple of tow truck drivers leave just as quickly in anticipation of a pile up & some work or how Miller just show's glimpses of Max inter-cut with the chase ahead of him. Miller likes to keep his camera really low on the ground, he likes to show the tyres of the various vehicles as they speed along to try & get a real sense of how fast they are going which for the most part is very effective. There's some violence here, there's a severed hand, a dead dog, people are brutally murdered & burned alive & there's a bit of blood. Unfortunately despite a thrilling opening sequence the film fails to build on it & it does drag at times unlike Mad Max 2 which is just fantastic throughout. According to the 'Trivia Section' on the IMDb main page for Mad Max because of a lack of money about 20% of the scripted action scenes were never filmed, I don't know whether that's true but it would certainly explain the uneven pace I suppose.With a supposed budget of about $350,000 director Miller & the crew worked miracles on basically nothing although the lack of any big action scenes after the opening is understandable if not desirable. Filmed in Victoria in Australia & was initially re-dubbed for it's US release because of the thick Australian accents. The acting is alright, Mel Gibson certainly looks very young & fresh faced here in one of his very first roles.Mad Max is a film with a reputation that totally baffles me, I just can't see that much here to enjoy. I think it's an uneven & rather dull film only livened up by a terrific opening car chase & a few sporadic impressive stunts for the rest of it's duration. Followed by Mad Max 2 which is far, far superior & Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) which I also think is a better film than this.",Mad Max

Their actions push Max to the breaking point and cause him to take the law into his own hands. Highly influential movie from George Miller that made a star out of Mel Gibson and spawned many imitators, as well as a couple of sequels. Although its sequels are perhaps more beloved today due to their creativity and style, this first one is an exceptionally well-made movie with memorable scenes and characters. The plot is simple enough but there is a cynical, downbeat tone to the film that won't please everybody, especially those just looking for a mindless action film. This has lots of action, for sure, but it's much more of a dramatic film than modern action fans might be expecting. The stunts are great, the direction very nice, and the acting is quality work by all. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?",Mad Max

25,zardoz-13,"""Mad Max"" Made Mel Gibson A Superstar!!!",9,1 July 2007,"Director George Miller's ""Mad Max,"" with an unknown Mel Gibson in the lead, would probably rate as just another undistinguished exercise in road kill mayhem were it not such a polished, high-octane, adrenalin-laced Australian production about terror on the highway. The overall novelty of this slam-bang import comes from the superlative camera-work of ""Pitch Black"" cinematographer David Eggby, the highly credible special effects, the super-charged stunt car driving, and George Miller's competent, no-nonsense helming. Although it isn't as spectacular as its sequel ""The Road Warrior"" (1981), ""Mad Max"" qualifies as top-notch entertainment for anybody who craves revenge-based actioneers.Fast-paced as it is, this enjoyable but rugged epic should appeal to audiences that demand uncomplicated plots and breakneck action that rarely lets up for a moment. ""Happy Feet"" director George Miller knows what it takes to make a stimulating chase thriller: action, action, and more action! He also knows how to manipulate the emotions of his audience. ""Mad Max"" concerns one revenge act that triggers another. Everything that the scumbag villains do here to Max, his family, and his friends is calculated to get the audience lathered up and ready to kill. Our anger mounts with every depredation that the lead villain, Toe Cutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne of the ""Farscape"" TV series), perpetrates against the good guys. When heroic Max finally retaliates against these hateful henchmen, the pleasure that we take in watching him dispatch them is virtually sadistic. Happily, Miller doesn't dwell unnecessarily on the blood and gore, and he keeps the action unreeling so furiously in this trim 93-minute escapade that we are enthralled in each new atrocity but aren't allowed time to reflect on the amorality of our hero's acts.""Mad Max"" revs off into high gear in the first scene with a brutal cross-country auto chase like nothing you have ever seen in films prior to 1979. Three high-powered police cruisers pursue another police car stolen by a bearded outlaw, Crawford 'Nightrider' Montizano (Vincent Gill of ""A Cry in the Dark""), who drives like a maniac with his girlfriend at his side. For example, one of the cop cars demolishes a mobile home on the highway when it smashes through the vehicle. The police cruiser behind it wrecks and the motorcycle cop, Jim Goose (Australian heartthrob Steve Bisley), takes a spill that breaks his leg. Nightrider barely misses hitting the mobile home family's toddler with his reckless driving. No sooner has Nightrider left these victims behind than he crests the hill and crashes full-force into a fuel tanker truck and vanishes into a fireball explosion! The James McCauseland screenplay, based on a story by Byron Kennedy and Miller, has few pretensions. Miller and company have set the action in the not-too-distant future like a cheapjack Roger Corman exploitation movie to imbue it with a sci-fi flavor. Mercifully, however, there is little to distinguish this futuristic actioneer from the contemporary variety. The biggest problem that the filmmakers faced is handling the predictable ""Death Wish"" revenge movie formula that they adhere to so as to motivate Max. After these Australian highway patrolmen kill the Nightrider, the latter's biker gang led by Toe Cutter show up to exact revenge. First, they run Goose off the road and burn him alive after he gets caught in his overturned pick-up truck. Second, they go after unsuspecting Max. When they cannot catch up with our hero, they corner his pretty wife Jessie Rockatansky (Aussie actress Joanne Samuel) and his baby son and kill them in an imaginative sequence that doesn't rely on blood and gore to make its point. Predictably, an enraged Max goes after the Toe Cutter and company.Far-fetched and low-brow as all get-out, ""Mad Max"" more than makes up for any shortcomings in the intellect of its script and characters with special effects and stunt driving that are so spectacular they justify themselves. Miller creates a lot of raw, sizzling vigor in the opening chase scene as growling cars race alongside of each other along sprawling stretches of barren highways photographed from low-slung angles micro-inches above the asphalt. You may have to wear a seat belt on your recliner while you watch this careening action to keep from toppling from your chair. Meanwhile, the special effects are confined to glimpses sufficient enough to be as convincing as they are repellent.Acting isn't required of the largely unknown cast. The characters could be played just as well by a team of moving van personnel, but boy do they know how to move the furniture. They are called on to do a fair bit of posturing, but more often than not they are racing hell-bent-for-leather against each other in cars or on bikes. Indeed, the groggy, flea-bitten bikers look left over from a spaghetti western, a genre within western movies that usually dealt with the theme of revenge. As for young Mel Gibson, he seems much too coltish and gentle to have his boyish looks twisted by the vengeful thoughts in Max's mind. Despite the excesses of blood and violence, director Miller displays commendable restraint in some scenes by staging the worst action off screen and letting the audience imagine for itself what happens. Nevertheless, if the action doesn't get out of hand, its meaning does. For example, Max finishes off the last biker hood in an especially murderous but game-like way that predates the ""Saw"" trilogy of films. He handcuffs the hoodlum by the ankle to an overturned truck and rigs an explosive device from a broken headlight with gasoline and a lighter. Max then gives the villain a hacksaw and a choice. The villain can take ten minutes to cut through the handcuffs with the hacksaw or only five minutes to slice through his ankle. Either way, sighs Max, the hood will be damned lucky to survive. Suspenseful and cathartic, ""Mad Max"" thrives on snap, crackle, pop action sequences delivered with whiplash fury that make for a hellaciously exciting but amoral movie.",Mad Max

In spite of this, it does put some genuinely tense scenes on-screen. The car chases and crashes are nicely done, and this hides its low budget fairly well.The post-apocalyptic setting and gradually growing threat are nicely done. This doesn't hold back - once you've seen the entire thing, you may be able to muster a bittersweet smile at connecting the setup and eventual pay-off of a certain bit. This is 87 minutes not counting the end credits, and 89 with them.There is some brutal, disturbing and bloody violence in this.

28,Uriah43,Over-Rated but Still Enjoyable,5,26 June 2015,"Set in a future apocalyptic world, ""Max"" (Mel Gibson) is a highway patrolman who has to contend with lunatics on a daily basis. One particular bad group of motorcyclists who follow a psychotic leader named ""Toecutter"" (Hugh Keays-Byrne) who is livid about the death of one of his gang members they called ""Nightrider"" (Vincent Gil). Because of this he wants revenge and he holds Max's partner, ""Jim Goose"" (Steve Bisley) responsible. What further exasperates the situation is that Max's wife, ""Jessie"" (Joanne Samuel) escaped from them and in the process made Toecutter look bad in front of his men--and he cannot allow that either. At any rate, filmed in Australia and with a rather low budget, this particular movie certainly made the most of what little it had. Having said that, I thought that it spent too long in setting the stage and unless car chase scenes really capture a person's attention this film really lagged in certain parts.

The movie basically isn't much fun to watch again till Max's wife and child are killed and Max goes for revenge.  This movie just needed more action or something as it moves way to slow in the middle.  Gibson is also dubbed in some versions of this movie, which is really stupid.

Very few people in the States saw ""Mad Max"" when it was released in 1979 because it only had a limited run here. Most Americans were introduced to the dystopian world of Mad Max with the release of ""The Road Warrior"" a couple years later.THE STORY: Ambiguously set in the near future after some sort of Apocalypse or social-economic breakdown, ""Mad Max"" focuses on the desolate regions of Australia wherein the police force, called The Bronze, try to protect what remains of society from a wild outlaw bike gang.""Mad Max"" is perhaps the definitive cult film -- it's weird, raw, primal, ugly, low-budget and shuns explanation. Star Mel Gibson was a complete unknown at this point.WHAT WORKS:-- Director George Miller is imaginative with his unusual use of camera angles. I usually don't take note of such things so it has to be exceptional for me to notice. -- The costuming and locations are great, shot in the desolate areas of Victoria, Australia, including along the ocean shore. -- Although a bit cartooney, the filmmakers and actors successfully capture the utterly wild, looney and lawless nature of the bike gang, sort of reminiscent of, say, ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) and ""The Warriors (1979). -- The girls are fetching in a girl-next-door type of way. -- The scene where a mother and child are run over by the outlaw bikers is creative and memorable.WHAT DOESN'T WORK:-- The film has a really dated, low-budget vibe, especially the horrible score. One might argue that this is natural since it's from the late 70s, but that's not what I'm talking about. A film can obviously be from a certain period without being dated in the negative sense. Take, for instance, ""The Exorcist"" (1973), ""Jaws"" (1975), ""Suspiria"" (1977), ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979) and ""The Warriors,"" they're all plainly from that 70s era but they also transcend it. They're timeless films, pure and simple. Not so with ""Mad Max."" -- My main problem with the film is its aloof air. As noted above, the story shuns explanation, which is great, but it does it at the expense of truly captivating the audience. The film's only 95 minutes long but I always have a hard time sitting through it; the story is good but it's presented in such a way that it fails to truly pull the viewer in. -- Lastly, the vibe is often too over-the-top cartooney; I would have preferred a more realistic air. It's too obvious the filmmakers were shooting for an Australian ""A Clockwork Orange.""This is not a negative point to me but it may be to some viewers, but there's not nearly as much action as rumored; there are many long, dramatic parts. In addition, what action is there is good but it's no more spectacular than pretty much any other 70's road/car flick or TV series.BOTTOM LINE: ""Mad Max"" is definitely worthwhile since it's the beginning of the popular trilogy and a definitive cult film, not to mention one of Mel Gibson's earliest performances. But, despite the many positives, don't expect to be blown away. It's decent but low-budget fare with a dated, aloof vibe.GRADE: C+",Mad Max

Being a low budget you have to wait until the end for all the crashes to come on screen but hey, don't worry. In the beginning you will have a chase going on that is a classic too. Excellent flick, and did stand the time and launched the career of Mel Gibson here as Max. Maybe the story isn't that original after all but still it all works the way it should be.

As soon as that baby roars to life, you know stuff just got real and people are going to pay. But here's the thing: this happens at the tail end of the movie. So it says something that George Miller is able to create something special and awe-inspiring before the main character ever gets ""Mad"" (in both senses of the word). Miller was at the forefront of the post- apocalpytic/wasteland genre, and ""Mad Max"" is unique in its own right. It's not inherently unattractive, just desolate. It's the people you have to worry about. The good people look like those just trying to get along in a Western border town, while the bad guys are the real crazies; agog and howling like banshees. ""Mad Max"" is a gonzo road movie speeding on the endless stretches of Australian highway ... and scored by the guitarist from Queen. That's beautiful. But it also makes for a gasoline soaked kickass revenge flick that almost demands to be screened at the drive-in.

39,JamesHitchcock,"For those who like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like",4,23 October 2007,"""Mad Max"" is set, ""a few years from now"", in a dystopian Australia. Although the second and third episodes in the trilogy are set in the sort of post-apocalyptic world familiar from films like ""The Omega Man"" and ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"", there is no suggestion in the first episode that any nuclear holocaust has taken place. Civilisation seems to be in decline- all the buildings we see look run-down and dilapidated- but the institutions of civil society are still in place; there is, for example, still a functioning police force. The main threat to law and order in this society comes from violent motorbike gangs who roam the highways, raping, looting and killing, and the police's main task is to combat these gangs. The title character, Max Rockatansky, is a member of the police's anti-biker patrol. At first, he hardly seems to live up to his nickname. He seems a quiet, dutiful individual, deeply in love with his attractive young wife Jessie, but is disillusioned with life in the police, especially after his friend and colleague Jim Goose is killed in a fight with the bikers. He quits his job to spend more time with his Jessie and their baby son, but when his wife and child are murdered by a particularly vicious gang he returns, swearing revenge.Unless you've seen ""Summer City""- I haven't and doubt if many other people have- this was the film which first made a star of Mel Gibson, although there is not much here to suggest that he would go on to become a major Hollywood name. This isn't, however, really an actor's film. Or, for that matter, a scriptwriter's film. The murder of Jessie and her son takes place very late in the film, which means that the whole revenge plot has to be squeezed into the final quarter of an hour. Apart from those fifteen minutes there isn't much plot at all; all the cast are required to do is go through the motions of acting out a story.Unlike episodes two and three of the trilogy, which were shot in the barren outback of New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia, ""Mad Max"" takes place in Victoria, mainland Australia's most fertile state, mostly in the rural areas around Melbourne. With its seemingly endless long, straight roads and flat, featureless terrain, this seems ideal country for a road movie. What plot there is serves as an excuse for showing as many car chases and car crashes, or motorbike chases and motorbike crashes, as possible, all lovingly photographed by director George Miller. The real stars of the film are not the actors but the stuntmen who make these scenes possible.For those who like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like (as Maggie Smith remarked in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie""). Personally, I have never cared much for the film, but then I am the sort of reactionary Philistine who finds acting, plot, dialogue and characterisation to be more important elements in a film than the quality of its car crashes. (I have to admit that the action sequences are well done, particularly in the light of the film's very small budget). I can, however, see why ""Mad Max"" has become something of a cult movie, particularly among the motorbike and fast car fraternities. It is (apart from ""Mad Max 2"") probably the ultimate petrolhead movie. 4/10",Mad Max
40,StevePulaski,"At times, it's just a title",6,12 May 2015,"George Miller's Mad Max is a pioneer in low-budget, action filmmaking, proving to mainstream audiences that multiple million dollar production budgets and advertising campaigns aren't a requirement when making a high-octane film. Even decades later, as Mad Max's once-crystal clear aesthetic has become more or less a representation of the sun-soaked age that one equates with seventies films, it manages to impress because of how coordinated the stunts had to be for reasons other than safety. Due to such a low budget (only around $400,000), stunts had to be done precisely right the first time, for reshoots were costly and unforeseeable with a menial budget.This fact alone could've rendered Mad Max nothing more than an obscure foreign b-movie that was lucky enough to get a wider release in the United States. Even some of the most impressive b-movies - Duel and Killer Klowns from Outer Space come to mind in terms of trying to do a great deal with very little - went on to live in obscurity and merit little cultural impact. Mad Max is the epitome of a surprise hit, spawning not only a franchise, but a career for one of the most successful actors, writers, and directors in history.We are plunged into a dystopian Australia in the not-so-distant future. Law and order, and society in general, has begun to break down in favor of chaos thanks to an energy crisis, leaving large metropolitan cities as the only ones who are able to survive. We spend most of our time in the Australian Outback, following a dangerous motorcycle gang known as The Acolytes as they terrorize passersby with their large vehicles and weaponry. At the center of all the camaraderie is Max (Mel Gibson), a police officer desperately trying to maintain structure and peace in his homeland. Soon after the chaos worsens, Max realizes that the only way to save his once peaceful homeland is to kill all the members of the motorcycle gang, led by two men known as ""Toecutter"" (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and Bubba Zanetti (Geoff Parry).Max's realization of the problem and method of action comes at the expense of his own personal ethics, which, we can kind of assume, were pacifistic up until this point. It's the classic case of a movie character being pushed to his limits, realizing that the only way to fight the power is to play along rather than sit back and hope everything will work itself out thanks to a lack of interference and increased passivity.Gibson plays an intriguing character with a fascinating moral complex, who, unfortunately however, isn't explored as much as he could be. His moral dilemma is downplayed in favor of the violent scenarios often occurring on screen, so much so that there is a disconcerting lack of character interest for our title character. Furthermore, the film's pacing feels off for much of the film, leaving the first sixty or seven minutes sort of deciding between wading in the water and throwing caution to the wind. At times, in the beginning, we can see director/co-writer George Miller and James McCausland attempt to weave a slowburn pacing style in with Mad Max's increasing amount of blunt force. However, Miller and McCausland cannot seem to commit to one or the other, and that leaves a film that transitions back and forth from extreme action to a humble focus on Australia's barren landscape.These changes take Mad Max down a few notches, especially considering that during these scenes of combat and action, we can't extract much else from them other than how brutal they can be. The moments spliced in between the action give us time to extract ideas, character traits, and personalities from those involved, and when there is a middling amount of that and displays of action impressive because of their spontaneity and capabilities, there's a looming emptiness to the film as a whole.Mad Max gets a large amount of style points, however, on part of Miller, who directs it with complete conviction and a respect for Australia's elegant, natural beauty. We are thrown into this world feet first, given little time to learn the politics of the road before heavily-armed muscle cars and motorcycles roar past us. This narrative technique and the scenery, made attractive by its ugliness, all work in the film's aesthetic favor. There is an unshakeable level of menace and vengeance to this particular story that could've bled through in mass amounts had our title character been more of a character rather than a force, or, paradoxically, just a title.Starring: Mel Gibson, Hugh Keays-Byrne, and Geoff Parry. Directed by: George Miller.",Mad Max
41,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Basic plot, but it's so much fun to watch",7,7 January 2008,"I remember my parents being such fans of Mad Max when I was a kid, but the movie looked so boring in my eyes. I never really wanted to get into it, I mean, I was a kid after all. But a few years ago in my film appreciation class, we were watching clips from Mad Max 2 when studying Australian films and I was intrigued with it. I finally remembered a few weeks ago how I wanted to see the three movies, so I just watched Mad Max and I have to say that I understand it's cult following. Mad Max promises and delivers, it's a low budget action film, but has a terrific story and excellent stunts. Mel Gibson, before he was Mel Gibson in Hollywood, you could see why he made it so big, his presence on screen is truly hypnotic and he makes a great hero. This story is so scary in the fact that I don't think that we are far from this future.Max Rockatansky lives in a time where his country has been taken over by violent, vicious motorcycle gang members who just go around torturing and killing people. Max and a few friends are the last members of the ""semi"" police force that is trying to get things back under control and bring some peace to their town. But when the gang messes with Max's friend by nearly burning him alive, Max is ticked and goes after them. But when the gang messes with Max's wife and child and kills them, oh, they've gone too far and now it's personal.Mad Max's plot is basic and can be considered typical, but it's a fun action movie that truly delivers. The action sequences were really exciting, especially Max's revenge sequence, he was so amazing and I don't remember the last time I rooted so hard for the good guy to win. Mel Gibson was really cool and I had a good time watching Mad Max. I'm looking forward to the sequels. I would recommend this movie for a watch, it's a fun cult classic that I'm sure any action fan would enjoy.7/10",Mad Max
42,MovieAddict2016,"Not great, but inspired and enjoyable.",7,22 August 2005,"The original ""Mad Max"" is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy. Many people seem to consider the first sequel, ""The Road Warrior,"" to be far superior, but I've never been able to warm up to it as much.The original is more creative and unique - it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where the police force wear leather and look like the Macho Men.The movie is very over-the-top and campy, but that's kind of the point. Director George Miller had a low budget to work with and manages to take a fairly explosive script and turn it into a modest action picture. For as extravagant as the film is in terms of ideas and concepts, its visuals are rather basic - car chases, highway battles and explosions is about all you'll get: no special effects (which I prefer anyway).Mel Gibson (in the role that made him famous - or the role he made famous depending on how you look at it) displays an early sense of charm and charisma that would carry on later into his career (coming into bloom with my favorite action film of his, ""Lethal Weapon,"" which was a great performance).Gibson carries the film and, with the help of Miller's creativity and direction, helps solidify ""Mad Max"" (the character and the film) a timeless action classic, regardless of whether the sequel may be more popular.Note: the original Australian audio track is typically dubbed on network television, but the Special Edition DVD also includes the original track and it's much better and sounds more natural than the cheesy edited audio.",Mad Max

44,KineticSeoul,Mad Max begins...,6,18 August 2014,"I would have had fun with this one if I watched it even during my childhood. But it came out before I was born and just seemed like a outdated movie in some aspect. However it's still a movie that somewhat leaves it's mark and it isn't really surprising why it's a cult classic. The plot is about a cop in the future well at least when this movie came out that goes over his breaking point and becomes a vigilante. And seeks vengeance in a dystopian environment against a group of psychotic punk road gangsters. This first installment is actually the most impactful one and delves into the suspenseful psychotic dilemma. And probably has a stand out car chase sequences when it first came out. It's not really a movie driven by plot, dialogue and characterization. But it does bring about that unique weirdness. This is a movie that has a good beginning that leaves the audiences with the feeling of it escalating into something great, but starts to go downhill. Mel Gibson really does drive this movie as this stoic and somewhat crazy anti-hero cop. Overall this isn't a movie that I thoroughly enjoyed or anything like that but I say it's watchable.6.1/10",Mad Max
45,thesar-2,Mild Mel,3,3 March 2013,"(Contains semi-spoilers, but damn – it's been out for 33 years. That said, this is my VERY FIRST viewing and if it's yours, read this following the conclusion of the relatively short film)Wait, this was, in fact, set in the future! When Mel does go 'Mad'!Actually, that's part of the problem, of many, that is, I had with Mad Maxand I mean *I* was the one with this singular problem: I thought this futuristic film was a post-apocalyptic tale and I looked for evidence of that for about 70-80% until I finally realized, it's just in the future.That's my bad. But, honestly, I try NOT to do much research prior to movie and the post-WWIII storyline I've heard about, is in the sequels. (Frankly, I don't even know that's 100% accurate, because again, I don't read about a film or background until I've been through the product itself.)I digress; this severe GRINDHOUSE/Horror movie (?) feature was so all over the place, I honestly had even further troubles keeping up. What I gathered is: this is the dim future, and I mean dim as in they had almost zero budget, or spent what they had on the demolition of ugly cars, and a gang of partially gay bikers are unruly and cops, for the most part, are highly inadequate to thwart their selfish habits, let alone keep the roads safe.After countless scenes of randomness, we get to what I'm assuming is the theme, and all in the final 15 minutes of the movie (yes, it took that long): Cop or not but surely semi-mad, Max's family is killed and he seeks revenge. Yes, even their infant who seems to vanish and reappear in the storyline at will. Too bad the one-year-old didn't go on another holiday right before the killing.Sure, I get the point of each event leading up to the climax is showing reasons why Max should be, in fact, mad, but you'll be more distracted with a grandiose and overbearing score, over-the-top Bmovie qualities including filmmaking, dialogue and acting and oddly satisfying cinematography – if you like clouds and empty roads. Oh, and you also might notice the number of gays here, or maybe not. Guys licking ice cream off his buddy's face or a ""Police Sergeant"" (?) who frolics shirtless with a scarf and waters plants, might make this the most homoerotic future road movie I've seen.You know, if they spent more time on the script, than fixing cars and motorcycles that will inevitably end up on the side of the roads while the drivers are thrown two states over, they might have had a real movie here.Finally, obviously fast-forwarding decades, it's proved that Mel can act mad or crazy, inside or out of film. Why then, does he give the tamest performance of his career in a movie called MAD MAX?Ha, I kid; he had years to mold his anger management problems into complete insanity.Side Note: Damn, those EYES on the big baddie, Toecutter, BEFORE he met his doom were really freaky. I can see (ha) if his eyes bulging out due to the impact, but no he's just anticipating a unpleasant demise.Side Note II: I'm curious if 3-years later, the writers of a famous TV show starring a car named K.I.T.T., would make sure the title included a 'K' to separate itself as far away from the character in this movie whose name, Nightrider, was repeated dozens of times before, but mostly after, his death.",Mad Max

47,Robert_duder,A masterful action/drama classic that stands the test of time!!,8,22 January 2009,"Mel Gibson has been one of my favorite actors for years. Although he has taken a back seat as of late his early films make him a legend. Mad Max is probably the film that spring boarded his legendary status. Mad Max is everything you can imagine from it's reputation. A post apocalyptic, action, drama, love story with a hero that endears himself with sheer violence and a vengeance nearly unmatched in film history. Unlike some people believe Mad Max isn't two hours of a man carrying out his vengeance but instead a slowly revealing story about a crazy criminal and his crime spree across a barren post apocalyptic Australia and when he crosses the wrong cop. The world that is created in Mad Max is very unique because it doesn't try to go into details about what has happened to the world, or the Government, or the people but you're just dropped into the story and left to try and unravel what has happened making the film far more mysterious and interesting and much cheaper for the film makers to make. The film released today would be star studded with million dollar special effects and wouldn't be nearly the same whatsoever even if Mel Gibson were still the star.Mel Gibson plays the young, handsome, tough as nails family man Max. A outback police enforcer of some kind he is known for being particularly thorough at tracking down and capturing gang members with his pimped out tank of a car (which is now a Hollywood classic machine.) Gibson is broody and calm and really makes you understand Max before the tragic circumstances. He then takes the role of absolute mad man...or Mad Max if you will when the villain takes everything dear to him. He is the ultimate hero and you will be cheering for him every moment of the way. He has no super powers, or even over the top weapons, just his own desire for vengeance...well and his kick ass car. Hugh Keays-Byrne is one of the movie villain greats especially from the seventies/early eighties. He plays the greasy, slimy, deranged killer and gang leader The Toecutter. Gibson and Keays-Byrne have terrific chemistry as foes and while he's not a scary villain, he is definitely deranged. Joanne Samuel is decent as Gibson's lovely wife. Despite the sincerity and depth of their relationship and the romance their chemistry isn't really all the great. But it does the trick enough. Steve Bisley and Roger Ward are good additions as Gibson's partner and boss respectively. They don't have big roles but they are memorable ones. I wish I could go into details about the Toecutters gang but I will lump them together as saying they all do a really great job and make for terrific villains.Legendary film maker George Miller helms the film as well as co-wrote the script. Strangely with the exception of Mad Max and it's sequel Miller never really did much science fiction or apocalyptic type films. He certainly created a captivating world surrounding Mad Max. The films violent scenes are no holds barred with some really gut wrenching, cringing scenes of battle and some of the most intense car chase scenes in film history. It's almost a given that after the success of the film that they would continue the series even if it never touches the original grandeur of this film. The true magic of Mad Max is that it's simplicity and low budget made for a truly remarkable creation. One of the truly great 70's, early eighties classics that is a must see. A truly unique sci-fi film!! 8.5/10",Mad Max

49,ElMaruecan82,"When civilization goes backwards, just drive faster than barbarity!",8,22 April 2019,"Forty years ago, from the middle of nowhere with no budget whatsoever and no bankable name, like one of these speeding cars that flatten the most cautious pedestrians in Tex Avery cartoons, came a movie that crushed Hollywood conventions while superficially toying with a few. And that four-wheeled horse, as dark as a Main Force Patrol uniform, vroomed its way to cinematic posterity because it still had a few tricks under its rusty carcass: a title as cool and catchy as a Simpsons stick on a windshield and the revving of a Deluxe engine in George Miller's vision.Miller probably didn't have the means of many directors of his generation such as Spielberg or Scorsese but his lack of resources ended up crating a more resourceful vehicle (no pun intended) for meaningful statements about violence and anarchy pending over humanity than any other dystopian blockbuster. The film was franchise-starter ""Mad Max"" and although it came from Australia, it had all the makings of the 'New Wave' that started in Hollywood in 1967 and was in its final gasps in 1980, so many glimpses of ""Duel"" ""Bullitt"", ""Easy Rider"", ""Deliverance"" and ""Dirty Harry"" can be found inside the gloves compartment.""Mad Max"" is set in a post apocalyptic world struck by a shortage of oil echoing the second crisis of 1979. George Miller could see the corners to which many people were (no pun intended again) driven to, to maintain a minimum standard of living, and saw there an inspiration for a picture that would both entertain and warn. Those were the days where the optimism inherited from the end of World War II was long gone and economical crisis and unemployment turned the West into a civilization's no man's land offered to the laments of the punk generation. And yet the film hit many sensitive chords by being nothing but a thrilling action picture patterned by cat-and-mouse chases between police highway patrolmen and motorbikes over roads crossing an Australian landscape where civilization is teetering. Nothing else.Like I said in previous reviews, there's something so fulfilling in empty landscapes that serve as settings to road movies, not the contemplative sort and that's a shame because they deserve a few moments of relief. It's a rather nihilistic vision of the world where the real frontier isn't traced by the law but the road, separating between two kinds of people: nomad and sedentary, those who drive and those who parked. Actually, those whose drive are driven all the same, they move like the rolling stone that doesn't want to gather moss, but their rolling tires seem to gather the whole crass of the world and that's the catch of their escapism, it's not idealistic, but expressing a nihilism so ugly and desperate it can only bring the worst of humanity.Indeed, those who drive have no rules, nothing they stick their minds or hearts to, they're no pioneers looking for a brighter future because the future is dark and gloomy under the sun. And in their drifting, they create their own microcosm. They have nothing to rebel against, but Toecutter is no ""Wild One"" Brando, he doesn't ask ""what've you got?"" he takes it without asking, the most vicious and hateful, the better. That's for the driving ones, sedentary people are necessities in the desolated land and occasional collateral damages. As farmers, station and motel owners, their exposure to danger is part of the routine so that there are two luxuries they can't do without: weapons and cars.When even a poor frail lady is ready to blast her shotgun on a gang of hoodlums and drive an overused van to save a poor woman, it reminded me of Lillian Gish in ""The Night of the Hunter"" who said 'it's no place for little people'. In this Darwinian world, the fittest to survive is the fastest to drive and the one with the quickest reflexes. And caught between these two worlds, between those who live and those who live for driving, you have the MFP patrolmen who drive for a living, apprehending those who challenge laws and the most basic commandments. Max Rockatansky is a man living between these two worlds.And the future ""mad"" one is the sanest of the bunch in this crazy world, he's got a reason to live: roots, a past, a job and even a place to contemplate. Basking in an ocean of static happiness, he's the perfect unmoving target for these gangsters on wheels and the perfect nemesis when he drives his Interceptor. In Max' establishing moment, he catches up a criminal legend named ""Nightrider"" and later, in a famous sequence, the villain starts sobbing as if he saw the coming end of the road, whether the real or the symbolical one. Maybe that bit of humanity caused his demise, in a way the Nightrider died when he stopped being ""superhuman"".And the film follows exactly the opposite path, showing how Max, the sane and nice guy evolves into a super but soulless hero launching the 'widower' trope that codified many of Gibson's characters. There's almost something Freudian in the death of his wife and child: in our civilization, killing the father means a step into adulthood, in these days, killing the family, the basis of any culture, marks your first survival skills, one's got to be deprived of any bond to be ensured to live, which is the antithesis of civilization, and why ""Mad Max"" is one of the scariest dystopian worlds. There can be heroes if innocence is dead.At one point, Max' friend made a rousing speech about heroes and Max retorts that he won't go for that crap. Yes, this is not your typical hero, the film that made Gibson a star drives on other roads, there's no heroism to embrace because when civilization has gone backwards, the only way to maintain it is to drive faster than barbarians, cutting them off or never fearing the collision.",Mad Max
50,gbill-74877,Not all that interesting,4,20 July 2020,"As an entry point into the series I guess it's all right, and I understand it was made on a relatively low budget, but there just wasn't much that held my interest. It's a linear story with a weak script, the paltry attempts to develop the characters are cliché, and there are many stretches where it's boring. There is also an odor of the regressive views of masculinity here; the lawyer trying to stand up for a client's right to a fair trial (how dare he) is a sniveling, effeminate intellectual, and the biker gang has several hints of being gay, the film seeming to either liken it with evil, or an aspect of the downfall of civilization these people are now living in.

51,g-bodyl,Unleashing Revenge!,8,4 June 2015,"Mad Max is the first film of the four-film Aussie franchise that was started by George Miller. This film is a film that takes place in the post-apocalyptic world and it's a stylish revenge movie. You can tell the film is low-budget, but that doesn't stop it from telling an effective story. Sure it starts off a little slow, but the end is incredibly insane. The film has several good themes to work with, and the main one is good. The downhill slope that Max's character takes during the movie. Far from the greatest movie of the 70's, this film nonetheless features fine acting, good CGI(for its time), and some epic car chases.George Miller's film takes place in the wastelands of Australia, shortly after the apocalypse took place. What little law and order is left, Max and his policeman must save as judge, jury, and executioner. When Max's family is taken down by a vicious bike gang, Max becomes furious and is about the dish out the ultimate price of revenge.This is the movie that brought Mel Gibson to the eyes of the public. He does a very fine job in this role and his displays of emotion really makes him a powerful actor in the film. He is fine for the action part, but I really love his dramatic turns in the movie.Overall, Mad Max is a fine post-apocalyptic action thriller. It's a low budget film, but the film makes every penny worth it. It's not the greatest film to come out, but it does set the stage for what will come out in the future. George Miller created a vast world, and I would love to see it explored more in the sequels. My only complaint is that the film has an outdated feel to it. It just doesn't feel right when compared to modern movies dealing with the same subject. But on the whole, a fine start to a rather good action-sci/fi franchise.My Grade: B+",Mad Max

And out of Australia, of all places, comes this post-doomsday yarn about a world gone bad, starring a completely unknown Aussie hunk named Mel Gibson (this would be decades before he became Hollywood's ""bete noire"" and tried to share his novel views on racial differences with the world) and a hitherto unknown director named George Miller. Well, to call the film historical is like saying that John Wayne used to do westerns. Gibson ultimately became, well, for lack a better term, himself. Miller went on to not only sequels but also a number of astonishing films and would eventually pick up an Oscar; and the whole notion of end-of-the-world shoot em ups just took hold and would over time evolve into the fascination with all things zombie at the turn of the 21st century.

56,Bored_Dragon,The movie that made Gibson famous,6,12 December 2018,"This low-budget Australian movie was made for only $ 350,000 and has earned around 100 million worldwide. However, from today's (or at least mine) perspective, ""Mad Max"" is nothing special.SPOILER ALERTThe plot is more than predictable, it is perfectly obvious. Still, the film manages to keep the tension from beginning to end. When from the start of the movie named ""Mad Max"" they put emphasis on his love for his wife and child, you do not have to be very wise to conclude that the woman or the child will get hurt, which will cause Max to go berserk and start a vengeful killing spree. But the trouble is that nothing is happening to them. In the ninety-minutes movie, for more than an hour, every time they show Jessie you expect something to happen to her... and it doesn't. Every time Max returns home you expect him to find her dead, raped or kidnapped... but none of it happens. This anticipation of something that we all know is inevitable, but is postponed indefinitely, is quite frustrating. When it (it's terrible to say finally, but) finally happens, the story develops in the expected way and turns into a classic revenge action, which unfortunately lasts only about ten minutes and it's nothing spectacular. Although the movie is full of violence and death, almost none of it is explicitly shown. When bikers run over Jessie and the baby, we see them roaring close and the killing itself we can only imagine based on the faces of the eyewitnesses. I suppose director resorted to such solutions to avoid unnecessary expenses, and not as an artistic decision, but it worked out just fine. The film is OK in every aspect, there are no major flaws, but it does not stand out in any way either. Satisfactory entertaining for one viewing.6/10",Mad Max
57,ironhorse_iv,Mad Max is crazy good time! It's worth the watch!,7,15 January 2016,"Heavily drawn from his observations of the 1973 oil crisis' effects on Australian motorists and the 1975's film, 'A Boy with his Dog', director George Miller & with first-time screenwriter James McCausland created, one of Australia's most known film, Mad Max. The first of many films in the series, the movie tells the story of a dystopian future, where the scarcity of oil has begun to cause the collapse of civilization. Law and Order is barely holding on within the towns, while, the highways are controlled by the outlaw gangs. Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) is a Main Force Patrol cop, held in high regard by his boss and peers, but when a crazy motorcycle gang leaded by the wildman, Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) began to terrorize his quiet rural town and his family. Max Rockatansky must takes new steps into the madness of the world, to become something more dangerous than the average police-man. Can Max find inner peace within him, or will the madness of the world, take hold on him? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, for a film made with practically no money and released in 1979, the film was surprisingly a very successful movie, not only in Australia and around the world. Despite the popular belief, the film wasn't a hit in the United States, until later. When it first came out, it was given limited release and all the characters' voices had been dubbed with American accents because distributors thought the audience wouldn't understand what they were saying. It wasn't until 1981's, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (originally released as Mad Max 2, retitled The Road Warrior in America), that America became more in love with the original film. Made with ""guerrilla-style filmmaking"", the film is famous for its wide-shot of the open road and its violent car crashes. Being call porn for people that love fast cars and action. The movie is very well-shot. While, the onslaught of then-intense action, is a bit dated, anticlimax and tamer, compare to today's movies. I have to say, the car stunt work that this movie had to do, is some of the best, at the time. It's something worth celebrating about. After all, this is the movie that put the Australian film industry back in the map. The hero, Mad Max is actually a good and kind soul with a loving family that he goes home to at the end of a long day of high-speed chases and shootouts. I know, that people might not like Mel Gibson, anymore due to his recent, personality problems, but back then, Mel Gibson can do no wrong. He plays Mad Max, very well. I also have to give some credit to his buddy, Steve Bisley as Max's patrol partner, Jim Goose. He was very charming in most of his scenes. However, the rest of the supporting cast wasn't that good. Mostly, coming from the villains. If anything, can be said, about the film's performance wise, is how chopping and nonsensical, some of the dialogue, James McCausland is feeding them. For the most part, I really didn't understood, much of what Toecutter or Johnny the Boy (Tim Burns) was trying to say. I know, it's supposed to represented, how crazy, they had become, but gees, at least, make them, somewhat realistic. I really don't understand, why, any of Toecutter's followers, even bother, following him, if he's that nuts. The beach scene between Toecutter and Johnny the Boy is a great example of this. Another problem in the film is how uneven, it is. I really didn't like, how Max's wife, Jessie (Joanne Samuels) has an altercation with the bike gang, with the very real threat of violence, gang rape, and child abduction, yet they still went on vacation, as if, nothing happen. Who oddly, brushed things like that in seconds!? It doesn't make sense. Another is when Goose's bike is sabotage, but Goose isn't hurt. He doesn't think, once, that maybe somebody is trying to kill him! Come on! The movie really waste time on this. Due to that, a lot of the scenes feel more like filler, than suspenseful. Another problem, people have, against the film is how depressing, the movie is. Despite some good time sequences that have interesting music like 'She's on a Licorice Road' by Robina Chaffey & Creenagh St. Clair, most of the movie presents a more or less hopeless vision of the future. The musical score for Mad Max composed and conducted by Australian composer Brian May shows this. Seeing characters getting raped, burned alive, and run over, isn't what most people wanted to see, for the hero's ""reward"" for trying to be with his family. The movie ends so bitter. Overall: Mad Max is a groundbreaking low-budget exploitation film that had some significant impact on modern popular culture, inspiring many sequels and knock-offs, but today it's perhaps, best known for the historically than it's aesthetically. Certain sequences still dazzle, and Miller's close-to-the-street cinematography still captures the thrill of speed in highly effective way, but the film series doesn't really establish its post-apocalyptic themes that well, yet. At least, not until Road Warrior. It's weird to see the beach landscape, all 'normal' lush greens and blues, instead of a washed out sepia tone. When's the last time you've seen a post-apocalyptic film like that. Still, I do recommended seeing this film. Just make sure to find the original Australian version without the English dubbing, for the best watch. Any fan of 2015's Mad Max: Fury Road will still enjoy this piece. So check it out!",Mad Max
58,The-Sarkologist,The film that made Mel Gibson a star,5,22 December 2012,"I guess one thing that I can say about this movie is that car crashes make money, and I guess this is what this movie is all about, car chases and car crashes. Max is a highway patrol cop and the film opens with the highway police chasing a ganger known as the Knightrider. Max wins when he causes the Knightrider's car to crash, thus killing him, and then he earns the enmity of the rest of the gang, who go on to kill his wife an child, and that them makes him really mad.This was the movie that pretty much made Mel Gibson a star, and the financial figures are quite impressive, particularly for an Australian movie. It cost them around $68000 to make and earned in total $100 million. Once again I guess car crashes sell, and particularly since Mel Gibson was an unknown actor at that time, that was really the only thing that they could use to promote the movie. Oh, by the way, Gibson isn't strictly an Australian since he was born in the United States, but it is because he studied at an Australian film school, and made his first appearance in Australian movies is why people consider him an Australian actor.When I first saw the movie I was a little disappointed because I was expecting something a little more post-apocalyptic, namely because that is what the second and third films were, but the idea in this film is that society was beginning to break down, gangs were roaming the highways, and petrol was becoming a scare commodity. At the time that the film was being made was near the end of the oil shocks of the 1970s, and apparently there were petrol riots breaking out in Australia. However these days I find the whole idea of fighting over petrol in a post-apocalyptic setting is somewhat silly because as a commodity, petrol would be a lot further down the scale than food or water.The low budget nature of the film does show out somewhat, particularly since it seems to be a bunch of car chases and car crashes punctuated by some attempt at character development. There is one scene, in the Halls of Justice, which simply did not make much sense at all, though one can gather that it did involve some crooks being let off from some charges that they have attempted to bring against him. However the fact that there is an established police force, and a court system, is clear that this film is not post-apocalyptic, but rather set in a civilisation that is in decay.",Mad Max
59,slightlymad22,Hard To Find Any Positives,4,22 December 2016,"It is easy to forget, not that long ago Gibson was one of the kings of Hollywood.  He was so loved that even if he made a poor movie, his hoards of fans always came out in force, and it wouldn't flop. Then came the meltdowns. His fans and seemingly most of his friends deserted him (a few publicly said positive things about him) Hollywood blackballed him, and his career was seemingly over as many casual movie fans can't look at the man anymore without seeing a totally vile, despicable human being. Yet somehow, he could be looking an Oscar nomination for best director soon. So I thought I would look back at Mel Gibson's roller-coaster career. Starting with Mad Max Plot In A Paragraph: As society crumbles around him, a vengeful police officer (Gibson) attempts to stop a vicious motorcycle gang.I outright do not like this movie, I love the final scene, and the preceding 20 minutes are OK, but getting there is not worth the effort.

61,sol-,Maddening Max,6,4 March 2017,"Targeted by a motorcycle gang after killing their leader during a dangerous highway pursuit, an Australian police officer finds himself torn between taking down the gang and simply running away in this popular action thriller. While set in the ""near future"", 'Mad Max' oddly does little to capitalise on this with 1970s cars, technology and clothes the whole way through. The middle section also tends to sag with too much time dedicated to Max and his wife and too little time spent on the antagonists of the tale. The opening chase sequence is excellent though, especially with the way we are only slowly introduced to Max with scattered shots of various body parts before we finally see him full-on. The final twenty minutes or so are very powerful too, with the near complete absence of dialogue in these last few scenes rendering them all the more memorable. The lack of dialogue acutely captures how Max has become reduced to acting on animal-like instincts and impulses, unquestionably scarred by his experiences, and the (mostly one-sided) final conversation really resonates. And yet, while beginning and ending on strong notes, it is hard to overlook the inferiority of the film's middle section. It is entirely understandable why George Miller and his writing team would want to flesh out Max's marriage, self-doubting and ruminations about leaving the police force, but they are never half as interesting as where they all lead: namely to a character so twisted with hurt, pain and anguish that doubt looms as to how heroic he actually is.",Mad Max
62,tomgillespie2002,Frequently imitated but never bettered,8,5 August 2015,"Taking inspiration from the 1973 oil crisis, which saw an oil embargo set by the OAPEC - sky-rocketing oil prices and causing a public panic for fuel conservation in the process - George Miller's Mad Max, the most profitable film in history until The Blair Witch Project (1999) came along, mixes social commentary with exhilarating action, set in a near dystopian future where the last remnants of civilised society are terrorised by deadly motorcycle gangs seeking fuel and debauchery. This idea of dusty wastelands patrolled by leather-jacketed psycho's with crazy haircuts has now been copied and paid homage to so often that it has become almost cliché, but Mad Max is where it all started, and it still remains the greatest of its ilk 35 years on.Although this is an origin movie, Max (Mel Gibson) himself is kept very much in the background for the first half of the film. After taking out notorious criminal Nightrider (Vincent Gil) in a violent opening sequence, Max, a member of MFP (Main Force Patrol) - a band of cops trying to maintain order in an increasingly hostile world - is relegated to the sidelines as Miller explores the world he inhabits. Seeking revenge for his friend, Toecutter (Hugh Keays- Byrne), the leader of a gang who looks like a member of Kiss but rules with the iron fist of Hitler, arrives in town and immediately starts to kill, rape and rob every law-abiding citizen in sight. When Max's partner is maimed in particularly brutal fashion, he flees with his wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel) and child, only to find that this bleak world is not quite done with him.Through keeping Max's screen-time limited in the first half, we actually get a better understanding of him. Violence breeds violence - and every time Max finds himself facing down one of his foes, he finds that he's actually starting to enjoy it. By witnessing the exploits of Toecutter and his crew - one particularly disturbing scene sees a couple chased down, beaten and raped - and the growing futility of the efforts of the MFP (Captain 'Fifi' McAffee - Turkey Shoot's Roger Ward - longs to bring heroes back into society), we can sympathise with Max's growing disillusionment and impatience with the system that is failing them. This is, of course, how Max became 'mad', so it begins with him embodying the fresh-faced voice of reason, but by the end he is serving his own kind of justice.Made during Australia's exploitation boom (dubbed 'ozploitation') for a meagre $400,000, Mad Max holds up phenomenally well. Miller demonstrated a real flair for action set-pieces as his career progressed, and the adrenaline-fuelled smashes and explosions here are edited with such precision that it makes you wonder how such carnage was staged without serious casualties to the actors (makers of the Taken and Fast and Furious franchises such take extensive notes on how to stage an exciting, coherent action scene). Mel Gibson says little but demonstrates the charisma that would later make him a world star, but the real star here is the world George Miller created. Civilisation would get even more sparse and brutal as the films progressed, but the original is what would inspire generations of film-makers. Despite a narrative dip in its third- quarter, Mad Max is pure action cinema, frequently imitated but never bettered.",Mad Max
63,Dr_Coulardeau,The Prophet of our new age,10,30 July 2007,"That's where it all started. In Australia and nowhere else. And I must say that landscape is impressive. It was science fiction at the time and it no longer is. In spite of all, we have grown into that kind of frantic frenzy, criminally biased and with no one to stop them. We are today speaking, and have been for a while, of a new criminal organization, a new mafia, a new gangsterism and it has come not to the desert but to our cities, to our suburban areas. These new criminals do not want power, control, or even influence. They just want to make money and to get the thrill of absolute fear around them, no matter what thrill actually, but the thrill of robbing, killing, blowing up. They have no political motivations like in the late 60s and early 70s. They just want to feel blood on their hands and smell powder in their nostrils. They are not even well organized as money making criminals. They take tremendous risks and don't even hide their tracks. Being run after by the cops is fun and they can kill one from time to time, a pregnant young female cop if possible. We have fully entered the modern criminal urban civil war and we better move our heads and rake our brains if we do not want them to take over whole neighborhoods where the law is going to be their law. That's exactly what Mad Max is showing and demonstrating. That's our future, that's already our present. If you don't believe it just check with Grenoble in the Alps or wherever there has been an ""incident"" (it should be called an ambush or a battle) of that type. What's more Mel Gibson had seen that the good ones in our society, those who have authority will most of them decide that it is going against the human rights of these new criminals if we want to shoot them when they have a bullet proof vest on and a heavy automatic gun in their hands. Some in the press even believe you must – not should, mind you – ask them for permission before shooting at them, and they no longer use light guns. They use heavy military weapons. Some even call themselves the barbarians of the latter days and one of these gangs (all the members are in prison right now) tortured a young Jew to death over several days just because he was a Jew, and the leader of the gang managed to go back to his homeland in Africa to find refuge, which he luckily did not find because he was extradited back to France and what tried for his crime. There is only one way with these: get the wolf out of the wood and declare the hunting season open and that species of wolves no longer protected except if they surrender and put their weapons down BEFORE killing, or even wounding, anyone. That sounds harsh but I have lived through the end of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, a piece of the end, and I can tell you there is nothing else to do because anyone of them who will manage to get out of the final stand in which they are trapped will start shooting again tomorrow morning as soon as they walk free on parole. France has had its batch of terrorism in the late 80s and early 90s but Mesrine was not tried and a few others were not either. I regret Carlos was. That kind of an outlaw does not really deserve a trial. I am told we must respect the human rights of these criminals. I could if their crimes were crimes of passion. But their crimes are crimes of blood, of greed, of absolute destruction. Mad Max got them all. Good. Unluckily that will not bring the victims of these barbarians back to life, will it?

64,johnnyboyz,"An Australian western that touches on several other genres whilst delivering a fast, frenetic and entertaining film.",8,25 June 2008,"Mad Max reminded me of a typical Hollywood western, little wonder then why it found such success in American and became the popular film that it is with its eventual third sequel being partly funded by America. But although I do not think there is too much substance to this first Mad Max film, it combines and updates so many typical conventions; realises its doing so and delivers it all in one satisfactory package that suffices in a department of a series of genres that it doesn't really matter.The film feels like a western with its large, barren desert location and its masked riders resembling a posse as they cover this barren wasteland spreading fear and destruction. Mad Max represents the ultimate updating into a modern age, in terms of convention and genre. These masked riders do not ride horses but ride motorbikes; the film is somewhat needlessly set a few years into the future but adds to that science-fiction, 'updating' sort of atmosphere and the general feel you get during scenes is that you're watching something of a very post-modern type. At its heart, Mad Max is a revenge film but to say it is a revenge film spoils some of the films best scenes and reasons for character motivation. Mad Max, apart from being a western and a Cagney revenge film is a romance; a rural melodrama and an action film complete with shootouts and car chases.Despite being set in the future, Max Rockatansky (Gibson) is a police ranger part of the law enforcement that deploy its officers with squad cars straight out of the 1970s. Max is given this hard-bodied and somewhat psychotic build up shot in close up format as he waits, like an animal further down the road, for his prey. His prey is The Nightrider but rather than targeting David Hasselhoff and his talking black car, he is after what we first presume to be a joy rider and his female partner who avoids and defeats the other police officers with ease. But after this introduction consisting of close ups of shades; the body; his car's revving exhaust and such, it is revealed Max is a more softer character  a family man who just wants to earn a living. So already Mad Max announces itself as a film that toys with what we think we identify as convention or formula and doesn't really let up from here.The film develops from this opening scene more resembling the opening stunt to a James Bond flick than anything else into a menacing and eerie series of scenes revolving the biker gang's want for revenge. It appears this Nightrider was connected to this posse and now Max is in trouble. But this is where Mad Max focuses on atmosphere more than it does narrative or developing the characters, something that with hindsight we can all say Hollywood do nowadays predominantly with all their summer releases and sequels. With all this emphasis on the family man that is Max, the threat that the biker gang carries is rather menacing on more than one occasion and the director does do well in getting across the correct feelings we as an audience are supposed to experience.Then there are the things that you don't expect to see in the film but are included anyway. There is a scene in which the biker gang hang out on a beach. It's been established they resemble a gang of outlaws in a typical classical Hollywood western but their transport are not horses, they're motorbikes; their choice of weapon are not Colt pistols but German Mauser pistols and pump-action shotguns and to add a further post-modern touch, they take pop-shots at a mannequin dummy for entertainment. But Max's time spent with wife Jesse (Samuel) on a farm owes more to rural melodramas of old and Max's cause and effect revenge sequence much later on in the film is played out with brutal pacing in a barrage of scenes in which some parts inside of you will want to cheer during. This sequence is the part of the film in which you feel the most is achieved, the most in which is accomplished. Away from the romance; the slow burning of the evil biker gang creating a threatening presence and the gradual destruction of Max's life involving friends and family, Mad Max's final third of revenge sees caution thrown to the wind in an entertaining and worthwhile sequence of events, culminating in a memorable scene in which an enemy character is given a choice of life or death.Although the film looks patchy in its editing and the low budget does show, I don't think it detracts from the overall delivery of the film. Mad Max covers an array of genres and includes a great deal of action, menace and odd humour with close-ups of the eyes just as certain people meet their demise behind the steering wheel. People may watch it now for the chance to see where it all began for Mel Gibson, but Mad Max is an entertaining foray in Australian cinema and suffices for more Americanised audiences now purely for its genre-fusion and emphasis on its everyday, upstanding hero.",Mad Max
65,leplatypus,Max to the sublime ridicule (rental),4,22 January 2014,"Well, this movie is so deadly serious with such crazy characters that finally it's funny: Full close-up and nervous directing, May's soundtrack ringing like alarm, bad guys very bad, it was really too much. One thing I understood with this movie is that when you got no money for production, imagine a story in a apocalyptic world thus you have an excuse to have derelict sets. In a way, it made me think to ""duel"" as the two directors make their name with a debut movie about a road warrior on a desert country but the comparison stops here. It was also funny to notice that like his good friend, RDJR, Mel looked puffy when he was young. The good thing here was to discover Australia, as there are very few movies that happen there.

70,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A careless attempt at sci-fi action that ends just as it gets good,3,10 May 2008,"If you read the plot summary for ""Mad Max,"" you've just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the film. You've also found out that ""Mad Max"" takes place in post-apocalyptic Australia, which will be helpful because otherwise you won't have any idea what's going on. The film, made in 1979, tries really hard to be Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) only that film, in all its strangeness, actually makes sense and leaves an impact. This film does neither and ends up being a car/bike stunt-filled romp that crashes like every vehicle in the film does.The first thing wrong with ""Mad Max"" is that it tries to sell itself as a revenge tale when no vigilante appears to take revenge until the final 20 minutes. If the first hour were condensed to 20-30 minutes and then the final 20 added on and then another hour added after that, ""Mad Max would be a cool action film with a great vigilante protagonist. Instead, Mel Gibson has to wait around and act like a sissy for 2/3 of the film and then have a sudden epiphany to seek revenge. I've yet to watch the sequel ""Road Warrior"" and I have to admit I'm excited for it only because I want to know what he does next. This first film was mostly a waste of time.George Miller does some great action stuff here, but his over-the-top symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something horrifying like a burnt hand or what have you completely ruins those moments. Its a terribly cliché B-movie technique.There is absolutely no thematic value or subtle critique of society in this film no matter what you might think. A great action sci-fi movie at least makes a point, but the gratuitous violence done by random, weird bikers doesn't say anything of value. Even the villain Toecutter feels modeled off Alex of ""Clockwork"" only uglier and completely unimposing. The PG violence just does not allow the violence of this gang to settle in and get a reaction from the viewer, it just cheeses it up if anything.I'll give credit for the amount of stuff the film crew blew up and crashed into things and Miller does a great job making you feel the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is mediocre at best and then after an hour of mediocrity, you get something good and the film ends 20 minutes later. I'm just crossing my fingers ""Road Warrior"" will fulfill the expectations of where this film ends, otherwise that's more time wasted. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Mad Max

This is such well made and brilliantly shot pic, making great use of locations, where you honestly don't know where you are. I loved the gaudy coloured cop cars. Max has his own. The characters are of course, larger than life, and I'm talking nearly everyone. I loved the goose, and the way he died was tragic and horrific. Does it deserve an R rating? Yes, but the violence is at a restraint. One horrific scene, I wasn't really aware of, when I viewed it again, was of the bikers going under a set of truck wheels, where a few body parts become severed. I never forget that spectacular, car totalling the caravan, and Max's wife and baby, running up the highway, before they're soon to be deceased, that avenging moment in that finale, I was craving. Mad Max is of course what launched Mel to bigger things with Hollywood taking notice of him. Honestly as I'll reiterate, what really impressed me, was how Mad Max was so well made, in it's entirety, like a well oiled machine, and with Mel behind the wheel, it's the reassurance of a supercharged action star, and a ground breaking film that refuses to die, ever.

76,freemantle_uk,Aussie Action!,8,14 February 2009,"If anyone isn't in the know, I am not Mel Gibson's biggest fan. Mad Max was a low-budget Australian action film, done to a high standard. It's is a dyspotic future film set in rural Australia where the police combat to keep law and order.The film starts with a ten minute car chase scene where a biker gang member who just escaped from the police. Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) is the police's best driver and in the chase the biker is killed. The biker gang seek revenge for their fallen comrade and take it on Max's home town, including attacking a couple and properly raping the woman. After no case could be brought against the gang they kill Max's best friend Goose (Steve Bisley). After that Max quits the force, but the bikers still pursuit him and his family, forcing Max to take action.A friend of my commented that Mad Max was similar to A Clockwork Orange and it is true to a point, but it isn't as good (but to be fair few films are as good as A Clockwork Orange). Throughout the film you get a sense of delay that was plaguing the land, and shortages of things such as fuel and spare car parts. The acting is decent, Mel Gibson offering the best performance, and its fun to hear him speak in an Australian accent. George Miller direction was good; he was able to handle big action set pieces and balance it out with a political and social commentary and human emotion. He was also the co-wrote the film. As I said for a low budget film it handled the action in a very professional manner. It is high-concept film making at it finest. They is also a scene which reminded me a lot of scene in the Watchmen graphic novel, and you see by the end that Max turns from a happy family man to a vengeful figure.If I had to be critical, they were some camp factors I didn't like, mainly the leather police uniform which made everyone out to be a member of the village people, and the brightly coloured police cars.If you like dyspotic future film (like I do) or are a petrol head or action junkie, then you will like Mad Max.Grade: B+",Mad Max
77,ackstasis,"""They say people don't believe in heroes anymore. Well, damn them! You and me, Max, we're gonna give 'em back their heroes!""",7,19 January 2008,"As an Australian, it was almost blasphemy for me to have never seen George Miller's 'Mad Max (1979),' a low-budget post-apocalyptic action film that proved an enormous overseas hit, spawning two sequels and making a star out of Mel Gibson. However, I finally got around to it, and, though the local film is certainly not a masterpiece, it is immediately clear why it achieved such monumental success, a rip-roaring jumble of fast cars, slick editing and jaw-dropping explosions. Unmistakably Australian, and frequently very funny {especially when a young-looking Steve Bisley occupies the screen}, 'Mad Max' is fast, mean and exciting  a wacky and testosterone-charged ninety minutes of pure entertainment. Back in 1979, out of fear that audiences might not understand the Australian accents, the American studios unthinkably distributed a redubbed version, though the original cut has since become the preferred release for the bulk of fans; to take away the local accents would be to rob the film of its distinct personality.In a bleak, dystopian future, the highways of the Australian outback are ruled by roguish gangs of motorcycle riders, who travel from town to town, stealing, raping and killing as they go. The citizens' only defence against these criminals is a respected, but poorly-funded, unit known as Main Force Patrol (MFP), comprised of courageous law-enforcement officers in V8 sedans. The most esteemed member of the MFP is young Max Rockatansky (Gibson), a determined family-man with a special skill in bringing down bikers. Shot on a modest budget of A$400,000 {and going on to make around $100 million at the box-office}, 'Mad Max' was also the first Australian picture to be filmed with a widescreen anamorphic lens. George Miller's direction seems somewhat shaky in the film's less adrenaline-charged sequences, with Brian May's original soundtrack, though distinctive, having a tendency to over-dramatise otherwise unexciting scenes. However, if you're going to watch this film, then it is for the extensive chase sequences, which are absolutely incredible, the camera weaving across the barren desert roads with a sort of gritty gracefulness.A film like 'Mad Max' requires a terrible, loathsome villain, which is where, I think, Miller's film goes completely astray. Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), the leader of the biker gang, rather than inciting terror or hatred, was merely a cartoonish caricature, and he spoke as though he had just emerged from the Bible. However, the strength of the hero, played with bravura by a young Mel Gibson, almost compensates for this misstep, and Steve Bisley's wise-cracking sidekick is the icing on the cake. If there's one advantage to watching a local film, it's being able to recognise the filming locations {I'm not far from Hanging Rock, for example}. Apparently, one of this film's most explosive scenes was shot just a 15 minutes' drive from where I live, and I'm just waiting for a good day to head down there and see for myself.",Mad Max
78,Coxer99,Mad Max,8,20 July 1999,"Remarkable action packed drama about a post World War III world where out of the apocalypse roars Mad Max, played with raw power by Gibson.

79,drqshadow-reviews,"Raw and Noisy, Max's First Massacre Has Many Rough Edges",4,4 June 2020,"The original Mad Max is pretty easy to boil down to an essence: fast motorcycles, rusty weapons, loud cars and bald revenge. For most of the story, we see Max as the cool, composed vendor of justice; a man who hasn't yet learned to discard the establishment in an increasingly turbulent world. He patrols a gang-plagued war zone, essentially a sleepwalking child, thoroughly unprepared for the foundational shock he's about to endure. Most of that pathos is left to the audience's subconscious, since so much of the running time is devoted to hostile moments of anarchy and long, noisy highway scenes with violent ends.First-time writer/director George Miller hasn't entirely fleshed out Max's world - this landscape is more rural homestead and less dystopian hellscape - and his skills as a filmmaker are still nascent. In fact, this installment frequently reminds me of the first Evil Dead, in that it's more of a unique, genre-driven learning experience than an objectively good, well-realized standalone film. Pacing is a major problem. Despite all the roaring engines and ballooning fireballs, it's downright boring at points, struggling to tie the crazy action to the more grounded, human transformation of its troubled lead. Frequent continuity errors are distracting, too, like how Max's young family completely forgets they have a child when it's not convenient. And, for all the build to their inevitable collision, the climactic conflict between anti-hero and big bad is basically just treated like a footnote. Max doesn't even flinch, he just moves on to the next guy. Just like I think I should do with this franchise.",Mad Max
80,alindsay-al,a hugely overrated film that is actually poor,3,8 July 2015,"After seeing the fantastic mad max fury road I thought I would go back and watch the original mad max films and I kind of wish I had not done so as the first mad max film is actually really poor. The premise of this film sees a post apocalyptic world where a cop looks to get revenge on a motorcycle gang when everything is taken from him. Mel Gibson was new at this point and he was pretty good as max he nailed the hard cop and he played the character well. It's just his character wasn't written to be that interesting and to be honest you don't really care to much about his situation because the film gives you absolutely no reason to care about ten situation. The guy who played goose, even though it was a pretty small role did a decent job and made you care about his character. Also the villain the toecutter was pretty cool and crazy and tell right villain for this film. The only problem is that his wife just isn't convincing and it doesn't help because you don't care about there relationship and it hurts the emotional moments. The story is just non existent for the first hour of the film and it is only in the last 15 mins that they try and give any story but it fails in its execution. The script is pretty shocking, the acting is bad and the dialogue just doesn't help these actors and doesn't give them the chance to flex there muscles. The look of the post apocalyptic future was pretty good but I think it definitely improves in later films and this can be said with the action scenes. The first action scene is pretty cool but apart from that the action never hits the same cool levels again. Overall this is a poor film that really drags and is not worth the watch.",Mad Max
81,estebangonzalez10,A totally bonkers entertaining film,7,13 May 2015,"""I am the Nightrider. I'm a fuel injected suicide machine. I am the rocker, I am the roller, I am the out-of-controller!""Due to the upcoming Mad Max sequel starring Tom Hardy, I decided to watch the previous films because I had never had the opportunity to do so. Mad Max was a surprisingly fun experience, despite its low budget and cheesy effects (which when you take into account that they were made in 1979 are actually quite good). A relatively unknown Mel Gibson played the titular role in this apocalyptic future where the Australian police force is doing what they can to uphold the law against the various menacing gangs in the wastelands. The film opens with a car chase involving a couple of cops and a cop-killer known as Nightrider. He has stolen a police vehicle and is crazily driving through the streets while threatening the police force through their radio. The stage is set for this wildly violent world set in a decaying society. Despite the very low production budget that director George Miller had to work with, he was able to pull off some impressive car stunts, which feel quite fresh now that we've been exposed to so much CGI. When the cops are unable to catch up to the Nightrider, Max shows up to save the day. He is a police man who has grown weary of the violence and wants out. He'd much rather spend his days in retirement with his beautiful wife, Jessie (Joanne Samuel), and their young boy. But somehow the chief and his partner Jim Goose (Steve Bisley) always manage to convince Max to stay on the force because they consider him to be the hero figure that the society needs. However, things begin to get even more hectic when a group of bikers arrive in town to avenge their friend, Nightrider. Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) is the leader of the band and they begin to spread more fear and caos in the streets. The premise is set for a fun and bonkers film.Mad Max had all the right ingredients to become a cult-classic film thanks in most part to the fantastic direction from George Miller who made this, his first feature film, with an extremely low budget. Some of the story elements feel very familiar now, but you can't help but feel intrigued by this apocalyptic world and the way each car stunt was executed to perfection. By the time the sequel came out, Mad Max was viewed by more people and its cult status quickly died down. And that is why now, 30 years after the third film in the franchise came out we are getting an expensive Blockbuster sequel which surprisingly looks very promising. I expected Mad Max to be more than anything a star vehicle for Mel Gibson who ruled the box office during the 80's and 90's with his irresistible charm, but surprisingly this break out role for him didn't focus so much on him. It is more about the world that Miller creates, and Gibson didn't really have to do or say much. This isn't a film you can go back to and say that he was a star in the making because everything that made him so popular in his next films was watered down here. He gives a solid and restrained performance, but I found the performances from Hugh Keays-Byrne and Steve Bisley to be the most memorable ones. Mad Max is far from being perfect, but you can see how many modern films borrowed heavily from its violent story. Mad Max is a futuristic sci-fi film that borrows common themes from the vigilante revenge films we've been so exposed to all these years. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Mad Max
82,Fluke_Skywalker,A post-apocalyptic Spaghetti Western,7,20 September 2014,"A staple of my childhood, I hadn't watched it in well over a decade, and while I remembered the iconography and the basics, it was a little fuzzy on the margins. When someone mentions the 'Mad Max' saga, it tends to evoke images of a post-apocalyptic wasteland filled with guys in S&M gear, but that's not the case in the first film. Tonally and stylistically 'Mad Max' is really more of a Spaghetti Western. The geopolitics of how and why things have decayed are a bit sketchy. It's clear there's been some sort of breakdown, whether national or global, but there's still some semblance of society here. I liked being thrown into this world without things being explained and trying to get my bearings. It reminded me of 'Star Wars' in that way.The driving action is poetic. White lines and blacktop flow by almost dreamily, without any of the Cuisinart editing we tend to associate with car oriented action films today. The cast is amazing. It's not so much that any of them are great actors (apart from Gibson, though he isn't asked to do much here), but each and every one look as if they just stepped out of the pages of a comic book and they play their roles to the absolute hilt.Though it's narratively wonky and drags a bit at times, even with its brief 95 minute runtime, 'Mad Max' remains a very compelling film, even apart from its significance as a genre defining/creating icon.",Mad Max

84,kirbylee70-599-526179,NEW LIFE TO A CLASSIC,9,20 April 2021,"I can remember the first time I saw MAD MAX. I was lucky enough to see it at a drive in, the perfect venue for a movie like this. A huge screen outside with tons of action taking place on the open road. The highway nearby with cars roaring past the same as they were on the screen. It was indeed the perfect location.Years later I'd see it on both tape and disc. The movie still packed a punch. Its youthful lead actor would go on to high acclaim and later undeserved infamy. Two sequels and a remake would take place. Director George Miller would helm them all as well as films like THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK, HAPPY FEET and LORENZO'S OIL. But that movie held the honor of being where those involved launched into successful careers and deservedly so. It also kicked off a wave of futuristic films all taking place in a vast wasteland but never comparable to this one.If you've never seen the film you're in for an action packed treat. The near future in Australia sees disrespect at an all-time high for the police. The film opens with biker and gang member Crawford ""Nightrider"" Montazano killing a rookie member of the Main Force Patrol (MFP). This highway patrol group takes it personal and sets out to capture the killer. He eludes them all with the exception of their best officer Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) and dies in a fiery crash.Max finishes his day by telling his boss he wants to retire. Before he lets him do so he shows them a new car they've made just for him in the hopes of his changing his mind: a supercharged V8 black Pursuit Special (call it foreshadowing, you know it will come into play later). It's not enough to keep him as he has a wife (Joanne Samuel) and child he knows need his attention more. This will be his last week.The gang Nightrider belonged to are set on revenge for the death of their fellow member. Led by psychotic leader Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Burn) they run rampant over the town, kidnap and rape a young couple and avoid capture with the exception of young Johnny (Tim Burns). Caught by Max and his best friend Goose (Steve Bisley) they take him to jail to await trial. But when no one shows as witnesses in the trial he is set free.The gang gets their revenge by taking out Goose's car not long after. As he sits trapped in the car, Toecutter orders Johnny to set fire to the wreck, burning Goose in the process. When Max find his friend clinging to life but burned to a crisp he immediately resigns and sets out to regain his sanity on a vacation with his wife and child. But the gang has other plans for Max.The story is a simple revenge tale but it is the visual artistry of Miller that captures the action in ways not used prior to this film. Select scenes make you feel like you're there in the car, there driving along the pavement and involved in the action taking place. The acting, especially by Gibson, is some of the best for a film like this. It gives Gibson a chance to show his skills and led to others discovering him as well.The film is finally being released in 4K with some wonderful extras from Kino Lorber. Not only is there a 4K version of the film a blu-ray version is included as well and at an affordable price. The extras included are ""Road Rage"" a new interview with director Miller, interviews with Mel Gibson and Joanne Samuel and cinematographer David Eggby, an audio commentary track with art director Jon Dowding, Eggby, special effects artist Chris Murray and moderated by filmmaker Tim Ridge, ""Mel Gibson-Birth of a Superstar"", ""Mad Max: The Film Phenomenon"", the theatrical trailer, TV spots, ""Trailers from Hell with Josh Olson and radio spots for the film.While watching this I was reminded of what an amazing and fantastic film it actually was. I'd forgotten the great story telling abilities of Miller and his vision here. The movie, made in 1979, has held up after all these years. It still is one of the best action films ever made.

A (now very) young Mel Gibson plays a vengeful Aussie highway cop who sets out to avenge his partner, his wife and his son whom were all murdered by a predatory motorcycle gang in retaliation for the death of their leader.Mel's character is the only sort of normal one here amidst a cast of absolute misfits both within the police officers and the crazy motorcycle gang. There are also several strange secondary characters. Like the man/boy in the woods!?

Except they also have a full gang of drugged out bikers behind them.Mel Gibson plays the John Forstyhe role. Except this ""civilized"" man is a trained law enforcement officer.The hoods here are not exceptionally tough, but have numbers and evil working for them. The top three are the psychopaths, and it's hard to say if their followers are as insane as they are, or just simply naive fools on drugs, following the leader.Aside from the psychopaths and the other leads, the other characters are very well written.However, the leading players are a bit too much like Hollywood clichés.That's the major trouble here. This is a big budget production, and clearly intended on being dynamic and original.The mistake here is that it is original in the areas that only a few people care about, special effects and style. These are areas that are doomed to be dated sooner or later. In 50 years, no one will care.It is completely lacking in originality in the story line. Again, it's a married man losing his family, and seeking revenge.

88,slokes,Cruising At The Speed Of Fright,8,25 October 2014,"The moment which made Mel Gibson as a film actor comes in a hospital room when he has a final meeting with an old friend.""That thing in there, that's not the Goose,"" he blurts out. ""No way.""Of such a moment legends are born.""Mad Max"" is a movie of many such moments, which coheres in a sporadic yet indelible way. Gibson is Max Rockatansky, a key member of the Main Force Patrol, whose duties include stopping the nomad trash and scoot jockeys terrorizing the Australian outback. Max is good at his job – too good. He's worried getting too attached to the ""rat circus"" for his own good.And he's starting to make some rough enemies.The first of the ""Mad Max"" movies, ""Mad Max"" is an outlier in a couple of key ways. Max is a more focused character here, genuinely concerned about his humanity and the love of a beautiful young wife who blows a mean sax. More key, the world we see in this film is markedly different than the more desolate worldscape we see in the two sequels. Things seem just slightly off this time out. There are dangerous people about, but also hospitals and commercial establishments and Royal Crown Cola. Max even eats a peanut butter and honey sandwich, a far cry from the dog food he eagerly downs in the first sequel.Director/co-writer George Miller was clearly not thinking of building a franchise here, but instead making a stand-alone action flick that borrows loosely from cowboy flicks and motorcycle-gang movies. Fordian landscapes dominate our horizon.What ""Mad Max"" has is focus, a lot of it. We get that right away in a cold opening featuring ""The Nightrider,"" a fellow we lose 20 minutes in, who is engaged in a furious, high-speed chase with police. Max is listening on the radio, seen only from behind and side angles as he waits for his cue to get involved. When he does, it sends the film into a higher gear from which it only occasionally comes down, never for long.Miller here was more interested in what makes Max tick than he was in the later films. We see Max in the beginning playing with a rubber Quasimodo mask which becomes a motif. Max is clearly commenting on his own transformation. He's not the only one.""I think we've got a monster on his hands,"" he tells his wife about their baby son.""Takes after his old man,"" she replies.Joanne Samuel is a luminous Mrs. Max, a soft beauty who reminds me of that other Aussie-American import-export Nicole Kidman. Gibson plays so well off her it really makes the movie more affecting as it goes through its terrible, inevitable turns.The villains are a right good bunch, too, especially the creepy Hugh Keays-Byrne as their leader, the Toecutter, who tells his tagalong boy-toy Johnny (Tim Burns) that killing cops a. k. a. ""The Bronze,"" is a matter of self-respect: ""The Bronze, they keep you from being proud."" Such a dehumanized bunch makes for worthy tire-fodder, but Max wonders whether he will turn into one of them if he chases them too long. Then he doesn't care about anything, and the triumph and tragedy of ""Mad Max"" become reality.It's a good movie, even if it doesn't square with the films that come after, unless you factor in some major external events this film doesn't suggest are about to happen. What it does offer is 90 minutes of savage, seat-gripping entertainment that puts us all on notice about the greatness of the Australian film wave and the guy from Peekskill, New York who would ride it to glory.",Mad Max
89,gcd70,Clumsy Action Thriller,6,28 February 2008,"Corny and somewhat clumsy action/thriller from George Miller (""Witches of Eastwick"", ""The Twilight Zone"") that is often nothing but hammy humour. One has to assume that Miller intended this film to come across as pure camp, or otherwise we're forced to conclude that he was trying to be taken seriously, and has therefore failed dismally.Miller and James McCausland's oft times humorous screenplay - of a desolate near future where anarchy reigns - contains plenty of nutty characters. ""Max"" - played by fresh faced Mel Gibson (always clean shaved even after being on the road for days) - sure is mad, and he has cause to be when a gang of bikers - led by Hugh Keays-Byrne in a deliciously over the top performance - burn a good mate of his to a crisp and then trifle with his lovely lady (Joanne Samuel).Miller manages to build tension fairly easily, but over does it a little too much. Some scenes are over shot while others are savagely abrupt. Where was the editing team? Cinematographer David Eggby should have received top billing for his spectacularly shot car chases - you've gotta love the interceptor and Mel's hotted-up nitro burner - but I'm not so sure about the close ups of horrified eyes at the moment of impact. As much as Director of Photography Eggby manages to contribute to this film, composer Brian May is able to take away with his appalling score, one of the worst I've ever heard! Too bad about the shallow budget (which shows with the occasionally shabby production design), though this film probably benefited more than suffered from the lack of glossy sets and snazzy special effects. Stunt team do a great job.Plenty of positives and just as many negatives in this first movie of the series which undoubtedly launched Gibson's star, though he had to wait for ""Mad Max II"" to go to the U.S. initially (released as the ""Road Warrior"") before this movie followed.

90,Witchfinder-General-666,Apocalyptic Cult Classic,8,6 June 2008,"Hardboiled, uncompromising and totally bad-ass, George Miller's ""Mad Max"" single-handedly boosted the Australian film Industry in 1979. Along with its even superior sequel ""The Road Warrior"" (1981) and Carpenter's ""Escape From New York"" (1981), ""Mad Max"" is THE apocalyptic action film classic, and a film that no fan of cinema should consider missing. The film is set in the near future, a future as menacing as the wide wastelands of the Australian outback. This outback is ruled by anarchy, vicious gangs of sadistic bikers terrorize the seemingly endless roads, and the only force to stand against their brutal reign are a small force of police, elite road warriors who risk their lives for the sake of civilization. One of these road cops is Max Rockatanski (Mel Gibson), a young officer who has a wife and little child. After conflicts with bikers, the gangs target Max' family. Having nothing to loose, Max breaks with the methods of the law, and takes the execution of justice into his own hands...Generally speaking, I am not a big fan of Mel Gibson, but he is doubtlessly great in the role of Mad Max. This ingeniously bleak and violent cult classic doubtlessly has its influences (the vigilante/revenge boom caused by ""Death Wish"" in 1974 also reached the homeland of kangaroos), but that does in no way lessen its great originality. The film is highly atmospheric, and the atmosphere is a apocalyptic one. The near-future outback is wide, menacing and inescapable, and its vicious creatures are sadistic, unscrupulous and without mercy. I do not want to give away too much of the fun, but i can assure that this film will not disappoint any lover of rough, violent cinema. The performances are generally very good (or, to say at least, they fit the film very well) and the film includes many highly memorable lines (""I'm the rocker, I'm the Roller, I'm the Out-Of-Controller!""). Max himself is not a shining hero, but a dark, merciless avenger, and the film is generally uncompromising in its story and tone. All things considered, ""Mad Max"" comes with my highest recommendation. The film is generally a masterwork of mean-spirited cinema and the final sequence, which I will not give away, is as memorable as cinema gets.",Mad Max

95,invisibleunicornninja,How did this become big again?,3,13 February 2018,"I've been hearing a lot about this franchise and decided to start at the beginning. This movie is not worth watching. There isn't a plot. Its just a collection of really, really boring scenes. Can this even be called a movie? That's a genuine question. This is a huge confusing mess. What am I supposed to get out of this movie? Its a series of shots of people standing around sometimes talking (usually not) and not having actual conversations. I guess its not a movie for people with brains?I've been reading other people's reviews and the only reason I can see as to why its good is the sequels. I can't find any reasons why people like this? I get the sequels are good, but why do you like this particular movie?",Mad Max
96,framptonhollis,off to a good start!,7,23 January 2017,"Over the course of this week, I have decided to watch all 3 of the original ""Mad Max"" movies, since I recently saw ""Fury Road"" and absolutely loved it. This is a trilogy of films that I have been meaning to finally watch for years now-and at last I can finally view these classics!This is the film that got the whole trilogy started, showcasing the doomed post apocalyptic Australian world and Mel Gibson's classic protagonist. It starts off as a charming, entertaining, but somewhat by the numbers action thriller, but eventually slides into some much darker territory once it morphs into a revenge flick. It's a great movie, despite being full of flaws. Some of the film's flaws work to its advantage, because they make the low budget feel of the movie even more charming, sort of like in the original ""Evil Dead"" movie, but other flaws are pretty annoying. A lot of the soundtrack is repetitive to a sometimes annoying degree, and the film is slightly slow and plot less (I'm all for plot less cinema, but it does not work in this movie) at times.This is definitely no ""Fury Road"" and, based on what I've heard, probably no ""Road Warrior"" either, but it's still worth checking out as it is a genuinely fun, classic action movie.",Mad Max
97,pc95,"Good, but not as fun as it's Sequel",7,28 October 2008,"Having seen the Road Warrior first, perhaps I'm a bit biased - nonetheless Mad Max, the original story, has memorable stunts, interesting characters and palatable music. There's some light-weight camaraderie and beautiful scenery along with a fairly good showing of some thug bike gang goons. Mel Gibson, has a fuller part in Mad Max ranging from family man to bounty hunter - he does a good job exhibiting nervous energy and raw emotion. It's a solid beginning. Meanwhile the Road Warrior is a treasure trove of excellent scenes with baddies truly representing what villainy should be like, and a much more interesting premise. Mad Max helps establish the Road Warrior. Its a good watch, a must for Gibson fans.",Mad Max

A young Mel Gibson plays a lawman in a near-future, gang infested Australia. His encounters with a especially vile gang result in a deadly attack on his wife and infant son, and the last act of the movie focuses on his single-minded payback on those responsible.Mad Max is certainly low-budget, but the movie doesn't really suffer from it. It is dated, however, and so many movies with similar premises have been made in the last thirty years that this one doesn't make nearly as much of an impression now as it probably did back in 1979. Watching this is a near-requirement for fans of Mel Gibson, but for everyone else, it's a decent movie that should be seen more for its classic status than its current entertainment value.",Mad Max

Before that he did a few other projects, but it was with this movie that he got known pretty much all over the world. And this may well be called a surprise, because this is still a movie that has been produced with a small budget, with a cast that isn't well-known and in Australia, a country that isn't too known for its movie industry. But it has to be said, it still offers some decent fun.'Mad' Max Rockatansky is a cop in the near future, somewhere in the outback of Australia.

This changes him from a tough cop into a tough man who no longer cares for rules and regulations himself, only for vengeance...Sometimes there seems to be a lack of a story, but overall this isn't bad for a low-budget film. And even though this isn't a very impressive production, the movie still has some good and decent action to offer, together with some acting that isn't too bad.

100,jacobs-greenwood,An Australian cult classic that became 'mainstream' Hollywood entertainment,8,12 December 2016,"Set in the not-so-distant future of Australia and its vast expanses of open spaces, a gay biker gang claims the road as their own by terrorizing the towns and citizens found there. The MFP (police) pursue them in vain until the Interceptor (driven by Mel Gibson, in the title role) can track them down; the result is usually a spectacularly fatal crash. Produced by Bill Miller and Byron Kennedy on a shoestring budget, this cult classic – directed by Miller's brother George, who wrote the story with Kennedy, and the screenplay adaptation with James McCausland – it made Gibson a star.The story begins when the gang's leader – the Nightrider, played by Vince Gil – escapes with one of the MFP's vehicles. The ensuing chase creates havoc and violent collisions which foreshadow what's yet to come. But once Max joins the proceedings, the Nightrider knows he's doomed because he realizes that his interceptor is just as crazy as he. Afterwards, Max's boss Fifi (Roger Ward) convinces his superiors that they need to retain their young officer, and the last of the V8 Interceptors (a souped-up car that runs on Nitro) is assembled to entice and keep him from resigning. Later, after Max's best friend, motorcycle cop Jim Goose (Steve Bisley) is killed, Fifi gives his sullen young officer some time off with a speech, saying: ""They say people don't believe in heroes anymore. Well damn them! You and me, Max, we're gonna give them back their heroes!""But Max, his seemingly always pantless wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel) and their child can't seem to escape the gang, bent on revenge after a mishap that causes one of their members to lose his hand. The Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), now the gang's leader, and his annoying lover Johnny Boy (Tim Burns), happen upon the vacationing young family and tragedy befalls them. Of course, now it's Max's turn for revenge. He'd wanted to get out for fear that he'd become just as bad as them – ""I'm scared, Fif. It's that rat circus out there; I'm beginning to enjoy it. Look, any longer out on that road and I'm one of them, a terminal psychotic, except that I've got this bronze badge that says that I'm one of the good guys"" – but now it's too late. One by one, he picks off the bikers who, though they draw blood, haven't got a chance. In the final scene, Max earns the adjective that precedes his name in the film's title.",Mad Max
101,Screen_Blitz,Entertaining but fuzzy start to the popular post-apocalyptic franchise,6,15 June 2016,"Many know Mel Gibson from outings such as the epic classic 'Braveheart', or the gun- toting detective in the 'Lethal Weapon' franchise, but it this post-apocalyptic action flick shined the light on him to stardom, even if the doesn't sit as strong as it oughta be. This film bought attention from many with its exciting action sequences, car stunts, and charisma of its action-energized titular character, quite surprising considering the low budget reaching not even half a million. It's is only too bad the narrative score could not live up to same level as the action and performance by the then-new action star. Directed by George Miller, Mel Gibson plays our hero Max, a traffic patrol officer in a rural town in Austraila in a dystopian near-future. The town is riddled with crime and ruthless gangs who prey on gasoline and scrap metal for car parts. When his wife Jessie (played by Joanne Samuel) and young child are mercilessly killed at he hands of a violent motorcycle gang lead by the vicious Toecutter (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne) . Max sets out across the barren wasteland to seek revenge of the gang who took everything from him. It all comes down to a violent but adrenaline-fueled high speed chase associated with amazing stuntwork.The dystopian setting in which this film take place is with no doubt nice to look at. The film was shot in a desert in Austraila which serves a moody backdrop of the post-apocalyptic world, a world devastated by societal collapse and depravity. The film saves time for the deserted setting during the action scenes which make mostly the beginning and the final twenty minutes or so. The action sequences are the biggest source of impressiveness to experience here. Shots of intense car crashes, sequences of gun shootouts, and nifty car stunts done by talented stunt doubles bring the excitement and energy in these final twenty minutes; and with the wild cinematography to capture the heat of the action, it all works just fine. Though the violence lands nowhere the near what we are accustomed to seeing in R-rated action flicks today (minimal blood - offscreen kills), there is still some sweet action to please action fans. But sadly not enough. When the action is not going on, we are stuck lingering in a plot that develops at a rather slow pace, and with a heavy amount of exposition; cutting the action time down to a fraction of the hour and a half runtime. So it takes an awful (and tedious) while for the film to get down to its anticipated ""good versus evil"" plot. But when it finally reaches the titular character's battle with the antagonizing sadists, it's exciting, especially with the charismatic performance by Mel Gibson who makes a memorable name for himself as the stunning action hero. Mad Max is an okay action film that has its moments of excitement but could have been better if granted with more quality writing and possibly a more villain, think in terms of Hans Gruber from 'Die Hard'. Overall, this film should at least be given a shot for those pursuing a classic action film with a charismatic actor like Mel Gibson.",Mad Max
102,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,The Film That Changed Australia's Feature Film Industry Forever.,9,27 April 2017,"Mad Max is quite easily the most famous Australian franchise that ever was. It's seen iterations in not only sequels to this classic movie, but also comic books and video games. And it all started with George Miller's groundbreaking 1979-dystopian-innovation of a film: starring then newcomer, Mel Gibson. The film is HIGH-OCTANE stuff, fast and furious (WELL before Vin Diesel's franchise; pun intended) and mean in a very very memorable way. Bikies, fast cars, revenge, and Madness supreme! Mad Max is a bit of an upsetting film, but this film broke new ground at the time. Its brutality in theme and content was unsurpassed at the time it came out, so much so that it was initially banned in countries New Zealand and Sweden. Of course it would come out later in those places but this censorship proves how much of an impact and shock Mad Max left in its wake. And let me tell you; this film is cinema history. Without this we wouldn't have things like post-apocalyptic fiction in games, comics or t.v. even.If you haven't seen the movie, give it a watch and continue the Mad Max series if you so desire.",Mad Max
103,areatw,Action for action's sake,4,28 September 2016,"I really dislike movies in which the action and/or special effects are more prominent than any sort of plot, and I found 'Mad Max' to be exactly that. The 'plot', which is basic and unimaginative, is entirely built around the action.This isn't my favourite movie genre, but the best action movies all have an interesting and solid plot to justify the action scenes. From the first few scenes of 'Mad Max' it was obvious that this was an action for action's sake movie, with the plot not really given much thought.'Mad Max' is an easy enough film to sit and watch without needing to pay much attention, because all it consists of is back to back action scenes for 90 minutes.",Mad Max
104,film-critic,"Is Max really mad, or merely just misunderstood?",6,9 August 2009,"""Mad Max"" is one of those films that is on everyone's top film lists. Not only did it introduce us to Australian cinema, but also a young 21-year old newbie named Mel Gibson. ""Mad Max"" was dark, it was brooding, it was destructive, and it never gave us that glimmer of hope for humanity, but now - nearly 20 years later - does it still remain the classic that it started? Sure, it was impressive to watch the crash scenes, it was powerful to see the world through Mr. Miller's disturbed eyes, but is it re-watchable? Does it have the appeal to see new things throughout if watched and watched again? For me, the answer seemed to float near ""no"". While I loved what ""Mad Max"" represented, what it was - a full body of color and action - it wasn't something to be watched again and again. Gibson does a great job as Max, a man torn between the evils of the road and his personal philosophies. He begins as an ominous optimist, able to stop crime as it occurs on the streets, but then as his sense of normality is turned upside down, his ability to react and adapt is seen. The final moments, he has transformed from the man we were first introduced to into something quite terrifying. One could also compliment Mr. Miller's directorial outing, at times it felt a bit episodic with tough edits placed, but for the majority he told a deathly story with great ease and excitement. So, again, there is no arguing that ""Mad Max"" is an important film, one that I am glad to have finally seen, but once was enough. It seems to be lacking that re-watch excitement.But why has that conclusion been made? What makes ""Mad Max"" mediocre instead of powerful? It is hard to pinpoint the exact scene, but the sense of ""alright, I've seen it - now what"" was definitely present by the end. Yet, there were points that I just loved. Gibson was perfect. He was incredible as Max, and the world that Mr. Miller created was intense. The opening scene, the car crashes as our bearded villain just yelled ""Toecutter"" was fantastic. ""Mad Max"" has one of those openings that just pulls you in, that makes you excited to watch a film of this intensity, but then where do you go? Miller seemed to indicate that more car crashes, more violence, more cliché family drama would indicate a stronger film. At times he was right, his ability to create different scenes set across the same backdrop demonstrated his originality, but then there were times where it just felt recycled. One scene that stands out, is where our gang of bikers track down a couple that happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, they chase them down and demoralize them as Max and his partner find them - then, almost repetitively, it happens with Max and his girl later in the film. In this post-apocalyptic world, there seems to be no problem finding someone. Space seems to not be a problem. This was another unexplained moment - where the coincidence of discovering Max or finding the biker gang should have been more difficult. These repetitive, essentially simplistic scenes seemed to detract from the power of what Max represented. One also needs to ask about the story, the unknown of what time or place we are following Max - would this have strengthened the story knowing what world we lived in? The understanding that this was a low-budget film was rooted in my mind, the techniques provided were impressive, but should that have been neglected for mediocre storytelling? Perhaps I misread this film, perhaps I missed the joy of why this is hailed as such a cult success.Another weakness against ""Mad Max"" has to be the relationship between his wife/girlfriend and child. Again, the lacking story helped confuse this viewer as to what dynamic they had, but when we have scenes in which the child is completely forgotten about - it just decimates the reasons behind Max's anger and utter breakdown. There were several scenes in which I yelled at the screen, ""What about the child"", then finally they would remember - he seemed to fade in and out of existence too often for one film. Then, when disaster strikes, we are forced to believe that suddenly Gibson would release his inner rage? It just didn't work. The same can be said for his wife/girlfriend. A stronger definition of character, and even more lines spoken would have helped me see the relationship. She seemed angry at first, the product of a failed marriage forced by this post-apocalyptic world to stay together, then we were introduced to love, then suddenly, she moved to idiocrity. Who would believe that running down a road, when there are open fields around, is the better option? It was these small inconsistencies that forced ""Mad Max"" from greatness to just another average action film. Two-plus hour sweeping epics aren't always needed, but stronger characters do help in creating the world that we, as viewers, are to inhabit for 90-ish minutes.""Mad Max"" is an important film, there is no question in my mind about that. The door that this film opened for future cinema in America couldn't have been done by a better group of filmmakers, but it isn't a promising classic. I could not watch this film again. The sequels I am ready for, but this ride is over - and the park is closing. I realize that I am in the minority, but ""Mad Max"" is a low-budget film that uses repetitive film-making as its staple - originality is present, but you must search to find it.",Mad Max
105,brchthethird,"A thrilling, well-executed Aussie actioner",8,14 November 2014,"Before watching this, I was aware of Mad Max as a character and that this was the role that made Mel Gibson a star. However, I wasn't completely expecting what I got here. It wasn't bad by any means, but MAD MAX is a bit more low-key than I expected. I'm guessing that the reputation was built off of the sequels. Still, what George Miller came up with for this first entry was pretty spectacular.The story takes place in Australia a few years in the future (which would have been around 1982 at the time of release). Society hasn't completely gone to hell yet, but it's clearly on the precipice. Biker gangs and marauders roam the countryside, attack random people and cops, do a lot of road-racing and are a general menace. They are pursued by the Main Force Police, who although tasked with managing the biker gangs and trying to keep order, are barely distinguishable from the people they're pursuing. It isn't a point that's particularly labored in the movie, but society has devolved to the point where the only difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" is a badge. This minor, but a core, aspect is what I liked the most about the film: the idea that there aren't any heroes. There is right and wrong, but the lines are often blurred.Anyway, among these cops is Max Rockatansky, the guy they call when the other cops get into a snafu. He's the guy that gets the job done. He's also a family man, with a wife and young child. Despite the post-apocalyptic setting, this is actually the main drive for the story, which is more of a revenge picture than a straight action movie. Yes, there is plenty of action, but the film is equally about Max's transformation into the badass we know and love, as it is about the overall look and feel and the superbly choreographed chase sequences. More fickle viewers might get a little bored with the lull in the middle, but there should be enough action to satisfy genre fans.And speaking of action, the opening sequence is probably the best out of them, although the final one is very well-executed in its own right. The first one, for me, is the best because it set the tone of the movie, quickly established Max as a character (as well as his role/reputation) and featured some amazing car and motorcycle stunts which, given when this was made, were all done practically. All of the action sequences were well-done in fact, but the first one sticks out in particular to me because of the way it opens the film. There was also a sequence late into the film where some bikers are pursuing a gasoline truck, and one of them pole vaults onto the top of it. I do have a little prior knowledge of the sequels, and this was a great way to establish that aspect as well as add more detail to the world that George Miller created.Overall, this is a well-made, engaging film with some great action and a minimal, but effective, performance by Mel Gibson. Highly recommended.",Mad Max

Then I did not have much knowledge of reviewing movie and I felt that time this movie was so good. But currently when I watched I missed the thrill. Mad Max actually not looking mad any way. His actions are rare here. Three of four part of the move is seems boring no action except craziness of toecutter and his gang. Police never take any action against them even their one of officer had been burned by gang. Toecutter get killed in a accident not by Max.

107,Beta_Gallinger,"Not as consistent as I thought it might be, but still a good enough low-budget action movie with lots of suspense",7,22 September 2010,"This is the first installment in a popular trilogy of action films starring Mel Gibson. These films were made early in Gibson's career, and his role in them was not his first, but it was the one that rocketed him to superstardom. Knowing that, I recently decided to rent the original ""Mad Max"", since I like a good action movie and had also seen Gibson in the ""Lethal Weapon"" films, another popular action series. I wasn't around to see any of the films in the ""Mad Max"" franchise when they were originally released, as the last one came to the silver screen the year before I was born, but by the time I watched this first installment over thirty years after it was made, I was aware of its reputation. I wasn't expecting an amazing action movie, which this certainly isn't, but I can still describe it as pretty good.In the near future, Australia has turned into a dangerous, decaying society where crime is high and gangs make the highways of the country unsafe to drive on! Crawford ""Nightrider"" Montizano is a demented motorcycle gangster who has just escaped from police custody and is now speeding along the road in a stolen police vehicle with his punk girlfriend as members of the Main Force Patrol pursue him! One of the police officers involved in this pursuit is Max Rockatansky, a young man with a wife named Jessie and an infant son. He pursues the Nightrider and the chase sends the gangster and his girlfriend into an explosive car crash, which they do not survive, so Max has won this battle. However, now that this skilled MFP officer has killed one of the members of a vicious motorcycle gang, other members of this gang plan to avenge the death of their Nightrider by killing Main Force Patrol officers! Soon after the film begins, we see the first chase sequence, with the police in pursuit of Nightrider, and as an action flick, ""Mad Max"" is off to a decent start with this, though Nightrider's over-the-top behaviour can perhaps be a bit much. I did find some parts of this movie dull, such as the part early in the film with Max at home with his wife and son. For a while as I watched the film, I found that really getting into it wasn't easy, but eventually, this changed. It gets more exciting after a while as we see the gangsters in their pursuit and how it affects the MFP, Max and his family, and others. There's lots of action and adrenaline, with the road chases and such, and Mel Gibson does a decent job in the lead role. The cast as a whole is pretty solid, with such other noteworthy performances as Joanne Samuel as Jessie and the actors who play the gangsters, which helps the intensity of the scenes they appear in! Overall, this 1979 blockbuster is not a masterpiece, but is still mostly effective, and I would say it's worth watching if you're an action movie fan and don't demand super-high production values.",Mad Max

He also makes Paul Kersey(Charles Bronson's character from Death Wish) seem like Bugs Bunny. Mad Max was an import that got circulated on video after The Road Warrior was huge. Mad Max is far different in tone to The Road Warrior, the pile ups here are just as exciting but this time there is a meatier punch and the mean spirited vengeance delivers the punch not found in the second. Still there is that famous scene where Gibson gives a saw to a biker, telling him to saw his leg off or blow up as well as car chases which are frightening in their intensity.

109,phubbs,Mad Max,7,11 August 2014,"The now seminal dystopian semi futuristic Aussie vehicle based action thriller that brought Gibson into the limelight and gave us a damn good franchise to boot.This story has now been rehashed many times over right down to the last detail, we all know it. 'Max' is a leather bound cop in Oz who takes down nutters in his souped up Ford Falcon with the aid of his other fellow leather bound cops. A gang of makeup wearing bikers invade the territory tearing it up and eventually killing Max's wife, child and partner. Of course this means all out bloody war and revenge for Rockatansky (seriously what is with that name?!).A simple premise but at the time the whole visual approach of the film was quite fresh and exciting. Plus the fact it came from the relatively unknown country of Australia made it even more intriguing. Didn't really know much about Australia when I was a kid (during the 80's it was all American culture), certainly didn't see anything on TV from that region so this film felt really new and different when I first saw it (apart from the odd Paul Hogan flick). The film mainly deals with Max's peaceful life with his family and how society has broken down due to oil shortages. Actually somewhat slow for the most part, the start and finale are the high points.The film kicks off with blistering pace as we get some fantastic car action from the now cult vehicles. Much like Japanese super saloons the cars aren't the prettiest to look at but they've got it where it counts. Great low camera angles, editing, deep rasping reverberating engine sounds, the odd bit of sped up film and lots of grinding beat-up metal really does make these sequences feel grounded gritty and real. The low budget seriously helps the film and certainly lives up to the notion that when you have little money you must be more creative which in turn can make a film look better in the end.Love the shots of Max as he sits calmly in his car waiting for 'Nightrider', the calm before the storm. Slowly he puts on his leather driving gloves, preps the car and then the still close up shot of his eyes behind tinted shades...reminded me of 'Drive'.I have always thought this film does tend to lag through the middle as said before. After the initial turbo charged action the film does sit back with the plot and take things gently. This isn't bad as you do get character build up for the events to come but you can't help but yearn for more carnage. Its hard to judge this movie if you ask me, the second is the best by a clear country mile, this first chapter is also very good but at the same time a tad weak. The bad guys are fun but not really too threatening...especially as they're on bikes (oh so dated bikes now) and so easily rammed off the road. Hugh Keays-Byrne does add much needed flavour to the bad guy gang but I always felt that he didn't really do enough, merely sits around grimacing and snarling into the camera (with eye makeup on). The way they murder Max's wife and child isn't very realistic either...not on bikes anyway, plus the editing is a bit jerky there methinks.The ending gets back into gear as Max gets his revenge, what you've been waiting for the whole time. Whipping out the trusty Pursuit Special he tears up the highway and does what needs to be done in reasonably satisfying fashion. The film may have been violent for the time but nowadays its very very tame with obvious dummy usage...but the real time stunts are still impressive.The film doesn't date tooooo badly, the cars are still awesome if a bit clunky looking, costumes hold up just about oh and the homosexual vibe is correct and present in parts. A big butch leather bound bald guy with a thick handlebar moustache and goes by the name of 'Fifi'?! The all male biker gang that wears makeup and stroke each other a lot...does make you wonder. Never the less a solid entry made even better by the fact it came from nowhere and with little budget, just a tiny bit dull in the middle.7/10",Mad Max
110,KnightsofNi11,"Very cool, very fun",7,10 November 2010,"Open to a vast and barren wasteland with a single lonely road cutting through the middle of it. A jet black car speeds down this road to nowhere. Cut to a cop car that is notified of this lightning fast daredevil. The two cops in their car car peel out with the words PURSUIT written on the back. Cut to a different vehicle, this one with only one stout driver. This car is also notified of the ensuing chase. It heads off to the scene of the crime. This vehicle looks similar to the last, only on the back the intimidating word INTERCEPTOR is written on the back. So begins a fast paced and high intensity car chase, the likes of which you'll hardly ever see done with such awesome fury. And that is what we are treated to in the opening of Mad Max. The opening scene alone makes this film worth the watch, but what goes on after this great action scene is plenty fun as well.Mad Max is set in the near future in the apocalyptic wasteland of Australia. It is centered around the ongoing war between the police and the gangs. Max Rockatansky is one of the most hard boiled of the cops, and fulfills his job as the interceptor, chasing after a gang of ruthless motorcycle bandits who murder, rape, pillage, and terrorize the innocent. When the gang murders Max's wife and baby son his true vengeful wrath is unleashed as he slips into a world of madness and cynicism. And this exciting character is portrayed by none other than Mel Gibson. This is of course the pre anti-semitic/certifiably insane Gibson, so you can't hold it against the actor at this point. But it's not like that would matter anyways, because Mad Max is just an all around fun film regardless. It's got some of the coolest car chase scenes you'll ever see and so you can't help but be entertained.You have to consider some things to get past the odd imperfections of Mad Max. Mainly it's important to know that the budget of this film was a mere $300,000. Because of this we do see some simplified scenes and some fast paced editing and cutting, due to the budget running out towards the end of the filming. Mad Max is a fast paced film, but there are some parts that seem to be cut short at odd moments, and thrown together quickly. In a nutshell, there is some evidence of the filmmakers having to make do with what they had, but they certainly toughed it out to produce an overall more than just watchable film. Besides, you can't fault a movie for having money issues when the end result is still extremely fun. So these criticisms are hardly valid, and Mad Max is still a lot of fun to watch.You can't help but enjoy this film. There's not a whole lot to it, but it tells an exciting story set in an exhilarating dystopic world of fast cars and ruthless gangsters. Plus Max is one of the great anti-heroes of cinema, who is a highly recognized name in the sci-fi world. Mel Gibson does a great job in the film and it really does accomplish a lot for what little it has. I definitely recommend this film for anyone looking for a solid and fun action flick.",Mad Max
111,DarthBill,Don't make Mel angry... you wouldn't like Mel when he's angry...,10,11 June 2003,"I didn't realize that Mel Gibson's voice was dubbed until the near end of the movie where it sounds like he's doing a Clint Eastwood impression. Since getting the special edition DVD which has the original voice track, I've found that Gibson's original performance is very raw and very unpolished, no doubt due to the fact that this was one of his first jobs and he had yet to develop his ""Mel"" persona. But his performance suits this gritty, low budget film just the same. This is just one of many examples (Excalibur, The Terminator) in which creativity and energy triumphs over a limited budget. The opening car chase is probably the best scene in the movie, which moves along pretty quickly and with few lulls and has a nice score playing over it. Once again I find that early Mel Gibson films are much more interesting in light of his later work.",Mad Max

One of the cops trying to stop the bikers is Max Rockatansky, who is getting fed up of his job so one day he quits. But one day when the gangs do something personal to him he plans on getting them back. Winner of The AFI Film Award for Best Achievement In Editing, Best Achievement In Sound and Best Original Music Score at The Australian Film Institute. When the film first came out it was one of Mel Gibson's first starring films and it was even banned in Sweden, due to it's violence and has since become a cult classic. Mad Max, starts off with a lot of action and is full of energy and a lot of fun for the first half hour or so and then it gets a little slower in the middle and picks up the action near the end again but what happens to make him get revenge on these bikers and everything that follows was fairly predictable and a lot of it I could see coming a mile away. I also felt that that film was too short. The film was also very low budget which I son't usually mind but the film really looked cheap in some scenes. The film was also fairly campy (which I normally don't mind as well) but some of the acting and dialog was almost corny. I didn't hate the film and it was entertaining enough but I don't think it is as great as some cult film fans make it out to be. The film was later followed by Mad Max 2 (a.k.a.

113,jluis1984,Raw cinematic power!,8,28 January 2006,"In 1979 this low budget Australian movie came out of nowhere and gave a breath of fresh air to the action/sci-fi sub genre. With outstanding stunts, imaginative camera-work, non-stop action and a charismatic young star this movie proved that big budgets are not necessary to make a great movie. All you need is heart, and in this case, gasoline.""Mad Max"" is the story of Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), a cop in the near future that does his best to keep the law in the Australian roads. The society is decaying quickly and the roads become a battlefield. After Max kills a member of an outlaw gang, his life makes a turn when the remaining members of the gang want revenge. Max will try to escape and protect his family, but he can't escape fate, and he'll turn into Mad Max, the Road Warrior.Mel Gibson's career was launched with this movie, and it is easy to see why. His performance as Max is remarkable, as he starts as a cop tired of watching friends killed and law being forgotten, while he is worried about the future of his son. After the series of tragedies he has to endure he ends as a warrior, as one of the outlawed men who takes justice in their own hands. even in the fantastic sci-fi setting one can identify with Max, he is an ordinary man driven by the circumstances.The rest of the cast is awesome too, and the script allows them to shine with unforgettable characters like Max's Best Friend Jim Goose (Steve Biseley), or the gang leader, Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne). While the script feels unpolished, the movie has an epic tone, as the ultimate battle between a man and his destiny.Director George Miller made the most of what he had; dealing with a small budget, he accomplished awesome action sequences that still look very realistic. It is really amazing what the stunt team did in that sequences. The movie has a lot of violence, and the raw gritty look the movie has increases the feeling of realism. Also, the camera-work is remarkable because one can feel the heat, the speed and the violence that Miller's futuristic vision of Australia has.The desolation of Mad Max is powerful, and as Max's life is suddenly turned to nothing, we can feel the same despair as the roads go to nowhere. Geaorge Miller's future is scary in its primal violence, and this same feeling would be taken to the extreme in the superior sequel: ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"".""Mad Max"" is a sci-fi classic that successfully mixes Action and Science Fiction in a near perfect way.

114,carbuff,This franchise took a very uncommon path from initial weakness to strength.,5,9 May 2015,"A rare case in which the original is weaker (in this case much weaker) than the sequels. The only reason I'm even giving this a mediocre five is that it provides the origin story for Mad Max. The special effects are cheesy, the acting mediocre, and the story and characters rudimentary and undeveloped. It is interesting though to see a young Mel Gibson, who is incidentally almost unrecognizable. Still, even with its glaring defects, it's a must see because it fills in the Mad Max backstory. Basically a really weak film though, even allowing for its age and obvious low budget. Quite surprising that such a solid franchise had such an inauspicious start. Powerful ammunition for the old adage that if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.",Mad Max

Max Rockatansky is iconic hero till it's day he is a true legend. Mad Max settle Mel Gibson a sure path to superstardom this highly acclaimed crazy collide o-scope of highway of mayhem cinematically defined the post apocalyptic landscape. Featuring eye- popping stunts that are electrifying and very convincing and an authentically nihilistic spirit this unforgettable actioner from Director George Miller is pure cinematic poetry.In the ravaged near future, a savage motorcycle gang rules the road. Terrorizing Innocent civilians while tearing up the streets, the ruthless gang laughs in the face of police force hell-bent on stopping them. But they underestimate one officer: Max (Gibson). And when the bikers brutalize Max's best friend and family, they send him into a mad frenzy that leaves him with only one thing left in the world to live for - revenge! Also staring Joanne Samuel,Hugh Keays-Byrne he later started in Mad Max: Fury Road as an Immortan Joe another villain. This actor is fantastic and makes TERRIFIC job of been one of the best villains in the movie history ever. Also starring Steve Bisley, this rugged race car of a film runs on comic book volatility... exhilarating, rowdiness and visual intensity. I love this film not much as I love Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior and Mad Max: Furry Road but I still love it. The plot doesn't start until 1.hour ago after Max family is attacked and killed. I love Max's car V8 Interceptor, high speed chases action sequences, that I guarantee you want see in any Action film today. There is any cgi in this film I didn't see them at all. The chases between Max and Toecutter on a motorcycle is fantastic, the crash and death Toecutter scene is AWESOME. I love this movie, I love it. As an dystopian action film is a fantastic that remains a true classic till it's day. The film has one problem that is focusing on max and his love life which is drama that hurts the movie and the plot starts really slow in the film. And between the film becomes very boring. The high speed chases on the road makes this movie interesting so that you don't fall asleep. I still don't get that hate for this film, some people are comparing Thunderdome to this film, clamming that is better than Mad Max is and this is the worst one and the weakest film in the franchise which is not. I highly disagree with all of the haters of this film. It Is still good so much better than Thunderdome ever was. I will always take this film over Thunderdome,I have tried many times to take this film as the best one in the series but I couldn't because it does have some problems. NOTE: The film is not a revenge flick like some people are saying, it is a film about car and motorcycle gang on a road it is Australian post apocalyptic dystopian action film. 7/10 B-",Mad Max
116,gab-14712,The World's Introduction to Mel Gibson!,8,18 October 2017,"Mad Max is a film that spawned a new genre of post-apocalyptic sci-fi movies and the career of Mel Gibson. This movie also gave birth to three sequels and a variety of spinoffs. Its been years since I first learned of this franchise, but it took me awhile to actually get around into seeing these movies. I have now seen this movie twice. The first time, I did not really like the film. While still an imperfect film, I appreciated the film much more. The story isn't spectacular-it's a just a road trip action/thriller with Mel Gibson killing all the bad guys who get in his way, but the characters are what make this movie work.So Mel Gibson plays a man named Max, a cop in the wastelands of post-apocalyptic Australia. To say Max is a savage cop to those who undermine him is like saying I only merely like watching movies. This man is ruthless when it comes to his career, but what makes Max a bigger character is the other side of himself. He is a happy family man with a loving life and child and they mean the world to him. But his world crashes down on him when a family tragedy occurs thanks to the work of a vicious motorcycle gang led by a dude named ""The Toecutter"" (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Then the story turns into a revenge movie and a rather good one at that.This movie starred Mel Gibson before he was a well-known movie superstar. This was only a small Aussie film and at the time, Gibson was only known in his Australian continent and then just barely as he was new to acting. But you can see why he blossomed into such a lovable (for a time) movie star. He added the emotional gravitas that his character needed. Gibson made Max his own and he really kicked ass when it came down to it.One thing you have to understand about the movie is how utterly violent it can be. You wouldn't expect this much violence to be in a 1980 film, but give credit to George Miller because he did not hold anything back. From the opening chase sequence to witnessing the harsh actions of The Toecutter and his gang, it can be hard to watch. But the action is built for high-octane action, raw power, and insane speed. That is really all we want in a film like this.My biggest issue with the film is how outdated it can get. This film was released in 1979 overseas and 1980 here in the States, so it's an older film obviously. But sometimes I was jolted away from the film thanks to the old-fashioned costuming and hairstyles. The cinematography is fine for when it came out, but it really does not hold up too well and it can be distracting when there are not any high-speed chases going on.I thought Mad Max was a thoroughly fun film. I viewed the film as an experiment and it works very well in that regard. After all, it came out with three sequels and dozens of similar sci-fi films. Even though the film is filled to the brim with brutal violence and crazy action scenes, it really works because of the emotional themes at its core about family. That really made Max the hero worth watching. It's not perfect, but it's good enough for the low-budget unknown film it was at first.My Grade: B",Mad Max
117,afonsobritofalves,The best apocalyptic saga ever.,8,13 September 2018,"Honestly, I thought the movie was not very good. Of course it's a great movie classic, and one of the best films of the '70s; But ..... I thought the story was weak, the soundtrack was bad (for the movie in question), to be a bit unrealistic (considering we're talking about a post apocalyptic world) and I thought the villains they did not have good motivation. But the film also has many scenes that take advantage of, as for example, the special effects are SPECTACULAR, and the cast is very good (especially since Max is represented by Mel Gibson). I recommend (although there are better movies).",Mad Max
118,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"With spectacular stunts, solid performances from the actors, and a unique story, Mad Max thrills successfully",10,25 May 2020,"In a dystopian Australia, a policeman named Max gets involved in a feud with a violent motorcycle gang led by a villainous Toecutter. After a grisly turn of events from their hand, Max sets out on a quest for revenge.Upon watching this and the other films, I've learned that this film became the directorial debut of George Miller (who would go on to direct the sequel to Babe and the Happy Feet films). Considering this became not only the start of a franchise, but a turning point for the apocalypse genre, that's an impressive achievement.The story is very well-written with some emotional beats and the revenge theme is well-executed as you feel sorry for Max throughout the entire movie. The premise is also well-handled which makes for some nice world-building. The pacing never contains a dull moment and it's very brisk and the editing and directing is superb. The music score from the late Brian May is great and fits the tone and atmosphere of the setting. The production design is unique and compliments the dystopian setting perfectly. And last but not least the performances and action sequences. Everyone does a great job. They portrayed the characters very well including Toecutter who makes for a nice villain and Mel Gibson who makes for a relatable protagonist Max as you feel his pain to the point that he would seek for revenge. Also, the action sequences provides some solid and inventive stunts in the history of cinema particularly near the end of the film.Overall, after four decades had passed, Mad Max is a perfect enough movie from an Australian director and it's recommended to those who haven't seen it yet. Check it out.",Mad Max

To rate it, I decided to view it again. But, I also decided to see the first two in the series. And boy, did I have fun watching this one! In a world where chaos rules, one man stands alone: Mad Max. At 90 minutes, the movie is riveting most of the time. The music is great and the acting not too bad, even for this kind of movie. Great shooting location, so it really feels like the ""not too distant future"". The movie is still good today, because the action scenes are real, done by stunts.

121,rebeljenn,Not my type of film,1,19 January 2006,"'Mad Max' is a film starring Mel Gibson in a role to defeat a violent motorcycle gang in the outback. He gets particularly annoyed at them when they target his wife and child in an attack. They act like complete idiots, so you never feel sorry for the villains, and their actions are borderline humour and hate as they go on violent killing sprees. It's not a great film with its often slow pacing and the build-up to Max's madness. There is a lot that could be edited out of it. It's also a pretty low-budget film, so it does not have a lot to offer in the vlaue of photography and cinematography. It's a little silly, really. I did not think the last fight scene was done particularly well, either. It's all about the violence, I guess, and I just did not find it to my liking.",Mad Max

But here's the strange thing: the movie was such a success they made yet 2 other Mad Maxes (with a 4th on it's way) and Mel Gibson became a superstar.Such an odd thing to come from a movie that isn't special in any way.

124,Darkside-Reviewer,"""I am the Nightrider!!!""",6,5 March 2021,I only very recently watched Mad Max (1979) after years of people recommending the film to me. I can honestly see why the film has garnered such a huge fan base over the last forty years. The film is basically a high quality B movie with the low quality camera and audio to match the movies gritty and bleak tone. Making a movie like Mad Max back in the 70s was no easy task especially on a low budget where the filmmakers could only afford to do a stunt once and pray they got it perfect that one time. Mad Max also launched Mel Gibsons career and to this day remains his most notable performance as an actor.The first half of the film just felt rushed in my opinion. The film opens with a high speed car chase that goes on for ten minutes before the main character is even introduced. I felt the film lacked proper character development for the Max character in the first half. This left me wondering if the film was originally meant to be more of an ensemble film rather than focusing on one specific character. Then in the second half of the film the Max character and his family become the focus point of the film with proper attention to character development. It was only in the second half that I actually began to enjoy the film. When the film ended I felt like I had watched two separate films one felt like an empty action film. The second felt like a story about family and vengeance with Max taking revenge on the darker side of a world on the brink of collapse.Even though I didn't really enjoy the first half of the film I still appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to achieve. It's amazing what they were able to do with this movie especially considering the movies low budget. The stunt work is brilliantly done and looks amazing even after forty years some of the stunts must have been very dangerous to perform for those involved.I recommend Mad Max (1979) especially if you enjoy gritty looking futuristic action films filled with high speed car chases and explosions.,Mad Max
125,Marwan-Bob,Watched it on the big Screen and i didn't like it that much,6,9 December 2019,I was a bit disappointed maybe because my expectations were high because of Mad max Fury Road.,Mad Max
126,Bogmeister,On the Road With Max,8,11 March 2006,"A few years from now... so it begins. There is a hint of civilization collapsing, but it's not really spelled out. As a guess, perhaps a nuclear war has devastated the rest of the world or it's a more gradual decline, sparing Australia to an extent, but it may be just a matter of time before the gears wind down completely. All important events seem to occur on the roads, where 'The Bronze' (the cops) wage battle against anarchy, usually motorcycle gangs. Max (a very young Mel Gibson) is introduced as dramatically as possible: the police force's best man / driver is on a lonely stretch of road, fine-tuning his vehicle, only glimpses of him revealed, as a high speed chase escalates elsewhere. Most of the police vehicles are labeled 'Pursuit' in garish color; you'll note (if you're paying attention) Max's police car is an 'Interceptor.' Visually, director Miller and his crew reveal information in this dramatic fashion throughout the film. You notice several times those dramatic low angle shots, whether in motion or stationary, showing us the close detail of the gravel; it's all about the roads and the machines designed to move across them.Many of the film's best moments are in the early sections - the introductions of the various cops, including the devil-may-care Goose and the larger-than-life police captain, and then the villainous Toecutter and his gang. The villains here really are the biker gang from hell; in fact, you can suppose that's where they came from, the wastelands in this case, visiting the few remaining civilized portions of the country to cause havoc. Toecutter is also larger-than-life, but a terrorizing version of such usually benign characters. Many of the later scenes adopt the tensions and mood of a horror picture, with the bikers akin to monsters stalking Max's friends and family. The vendetta Max takes upon himself occurs much later in the film than many would think; this isn't a simple revenge picture, as it's hinted in previews. The vengeance factor kicks in only in the last 15 minutes, and things happen at a pretty breakneck speed, but that doesn't mean the rest of the pic is slow, far from it.Because of this sort-of eclectic mix of styles, the film is far more interesting and memorable than all the other so-called vigilante thrillers during this period. You can't really pin it down to one particular genre (science fiction? chase?). Miller would build upon this style and expand on it for the even-better sequel, ""The Road Warrior"" aka ""Mad Max 2"".",Mad Max
127,LoneWolfAndCub,Expected More,5,7 January 2006,"Mad Max, directed by George Miller, is considered a classic and has gathered cult status. I really didn't see all that much in this tale of revenge set in the future.Mel Gibson plays Max, a cop who decides to take a vacation with his wife and son. After his wife has a run-in with the Toecutter gang, the wife and her son are both brutally killed. This sets Max off and he goes on a rampage and sets out to kill every member in the gang.I can understand why this is considered such a classic but I really didn't enjoy this as much as I would have liked to. It started off really well but then it descended into a slow middle section and an average finale which should have packed a huge punch but instead, left me disappointed. The idea of future highways overrun by gangs was great and this could have been brilliant.I can only give this 2½/5.",Mad Max

This is the pure definition of an action movie. And Toecutter is kind of cool. The horrific ending of this movie is so awesome it leaves you feeling edgey.

I didn't remember the first one as such a low budget film, as it really is, but that is typically how it is when you revisit the classics now :)It is still a very good start of this franchise/series of films, and this really sets the mood and attitude of the road warrior in the second movie. I remembered it as more apocalyptic, but that really starts in the second film, but the bad guys are the same crazy bunch as I remember and Toe cutter is a bad ass, they all bare some weird resemblance to Alex and his crew from Clockwork Orange, but in a more outback- apocalyptic-drive-you-crazy kind of way :)",Mad Max
131,Al_The_Strange,Mad Max Review,8,17 May 2015,"Max is a cop in an undetermined future, where law and order approaches its breaking point and the world is starting to become overrun by violent, anarchic gangs. Max becomes mad when these gangs harass him and push him to the edge. When the madness takes over, Max will not stop until he runs down all his enemies.Right from the start, Mad Max establishes itself as a thrilling new breed of dystopian sci-fi with a frenetic highs-speed car chase. Car chases is the big draw that would persist through the whole film and in its famous sequels. In the case of this film, the chases are pretty simple, but they are well-filmed to emphasize speed, destruction, and violence. The vehicular carnage is often awe-inspiring, but in between the action, the film continues to captivate with its hard-edged portrayal of crazy villains and tormented heroes. The film's last half exudes suspense as the villains hone in on Max and his family, before the film wraps up with a wicked sense of justice.To be honest, the film never was completely enthralling to me personally. At first glance, the film felt rather slow, drab, and disconnected. Only on repeat viewings would I find the film so engaging; the film's appeal ultimately hinges on how well you can relate to the characters, the crumbling world they live in, and the film's style. In time, I found myself becoming more and more enamored by the characters and the film overall.The film embodies the structure and form of a typical American western, and the characters fulfill familiar archetypes of various heroes and villains. As such, the story is made to be pretty straightforward, but it implicitly carries themes of social decay, and the conflict between civility and barbarism. These themes fit into the setting perfectly; it's a bizarre post-modern world where things appear to be in shambles, but the last vestiges of society linger. In this world, the film is ultimately all about a man gradually losing his humanity, until he crosses a certain threshold and becomes the very monster he always feared. Even though it takes a while to get to the sharply-focused last act, the transformation of ""Mad Max"" is a compelling one, filled with tragedy and rage.The film captures this tale with very superb photography. Camera angles are really great, and the film is very concisely-edited. Max was Mel Gibson's breakout role, and he pulled it off really well, becoming a hero who looks cool but also elicits empathy. I developed quite the soft spot for Joanne Samuel's performance, which is tenderly-emotional but still well-grounded. Aside from her, everybody's performances (even Mel's) tends to get pretty nutty and over-the-top at times, but it fits in with the film's anarchic view of the near-future. Writing gets the job done. This production didn't have much of a budget, so many of the props and costumes were done on the cheap. Can't say I'm a fan of the police car designs, or how some scenes seemed to be cluttered with modern-looking items. Fortunately, the film's budgetary limitations rarely show, as the film makes apt use of real locations and real materials to bring its scappy view of the future to life. Brian May's music score is really decent.Even though future Mad Max films would improve on budget and ambition, this original film kicked it all off with a simple, but emotional and powerful tale, of a man succumbing to chaos. Even though I found the movie a bit dull at first glance, I wound up loving it, especially in the way it crafts its story with a few simple images that gives it am emotional punch. Among those images, the scene with a single shoe bouncing on the open road as the bikers roar by is still one that exudes tragedy and desperation, and it's one of those scenes that hits me the hardest. For all those well-crafted moments, the film is worth seeing at least once.4/5 (Experience: Good | Content: Good | Film: Very Good)",Mad Max

This is one of the worst edited movies to ever make it to the big screen. The transitions are just terrible in some places, inconsistent throughout, and a college student can do better editing with a free app in 2019. Also, this movie is very gay... very, very gay. Gay rapes, gay innuendo, men on motorcycles wearing makeup, chasing men, doing man-stuff. The pacing is all wrong - 110 minutes of poorly executed build up, 15 minutes of poorly executed resolution and credits. The sound mix was off - music was too loud, came in late in some scenes, and the crescendo often missed the big moment in the scene.

133,bsinc,A movie to watch on TV,7,23 April 2002,"This was a nice surprise. I watched the following two Mad Max movies before this one and I wasn't impressed at all. They were quite boring, but the original, the first in the series, is of course the best. It's nothing special, but it is, if you know what I mean. There are some really nice touches to it, like the villain, the one with peroxide colored hair in the front. That actor's performance was great, over the top. Also the costumes were nice and the car chase scenes were well made and who can forget Max's monologue right at the end when he explains that the guy has to sow off his foot.Mel Gibson was a great choice for this movie and I'm really glad it made him what he is today. There are, although,signs of bad acting, like Max's wife. But the only thing that really bothered me was that the peroxide villain just died somewhere along the end climax, without even showing how. I was really looking forward to seeing him and Max battle it out, but sadly that wasn't the case. Still, a good low budget movie.       7/10",Mad Max

Before this movie Mel Gibson had only acted in 3 other movies, one was named TIM which he won an Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in.MAD MAX was based on the traditional western genre, telling the story of a broken down society and it became a top-grossing Australian film.The movie maker George Miller was a medical doctor and amateur filmmaker Byron Kennedy, met in 1971 at a summer film camp, they worked together in producing the Mad Max movie 8 years after meeting. Miller and Kennedy scrambled for the budget and due to the film's low budget; they could only afford to give Gibson a real leather jacket and pants.The movie plot is based around love and revenge. In a dystopic Australia, after the Earth's oil supplies were nearly exhausted, the world started to break down due to energy shortages and people running amiss doing as they like.A motorcycle gang member named Crawford ""Nightrider"" Montizano escaped police custody and is attempting to outrun the Main Force Patrol (MFP).He was successful in eluding his initial pursuers, but the call was made to the MFP's top pursuit man, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) who then chases down the gang member and engages the less-skilled Nightrider in a high-speed chase.During the chase Nightrider was involved in an auto crash resulting to his death.His gang members return to town led by Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and Bubba Zanetti (Geoff Parry). They were seeking for who was involved in his death when they decided to vandalise some property to steal fuel, they chased down a couple whom the raped in the process one of their member Johnny (Tim Burns) was too drunk to ride and was left behind. Max and Goose (Steve Bisley) show up arrest Johnny. Then he was later released since there was no evidence.The gang now bent on revenge, decide to take Goose and Max on, which lead to death on various levels.The acting the cinematography of Mad Max is something that Miller and Kennedy did a good job on based their budget. Miller still went ahead to make great movies like Babe, Happy feet and the sequels of both films.Mad Max is fun and captivating and worth watching.www.lagsreviews.com",Mad Max
135,Cinemaniac1984,The movie that made Mel Gibson an international superstar. You'd be mad to miss Mad Max.,9,23 May 2015,"Mad Max has firmly cemented itself as one of the best Australian movies of all time. It's no surprise that Max Max is one of the many movies that put Australian cinema firmly on the international map. When Mad Max was initially released in the USA the dialogue had to be redubbed so audiences could understand the movie, however the movie proved to be not so popular in the USA however its popularity skyrocketed upon the release of Mad Max 2 in 1981 and only then did Max Max finally find an audience. Mad Max also propelled Mel Gibson to international stardom and director George Miller would go on to bigger and better things with a further three Mad Max sequels in 1981, 1985, and 2015, The Witches of Eastwick (1987), Lorenzo's Oil (1992), Babe (1995), and Happy Feet (2006).Set in an unspecified period in the not too distant future, Mad Max immediately starts with a bang when a motorcycle gang member named ""Nightrider"" (Vincent Gil) has killed a police officer and commandeered a police vehicle. Nightrider and his girlfriend are leading the Main Force Patrol (MFP) on a police pursuit, wrecking havoc across the road and leaving a path of destruction in his wake. Amongst the MFP officers in pursuit include Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) who has garnered a reputation in the MFP as a top pursuit officer, and the cocky and charismatic motorcycle officer Jim ""Goose"" Rains (Steve Bisley). Max manages to maintain pursuit with Nightrider which results in the death of Nightrider and his girlfriend in a fiery crash. Max's boss who is MFP Captain Fred ""Fifi"" Macaffee (Roger Ward), a burly and bald man, supports Max following the pursuit however warns that the motorcycle gang will have Max marked for death.The motorcycle gang is led by Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Amongst the other gang members include Bubba Zanetti (Geoff Parry) and Johnny the Boy (Tim Burns). The rest of the gang is made up of uncivilised thugs who behave like a pack of animals. The motorcycle gang make their presence felt by rampaging through the town, vandalizing property, stealing fuel, and terrorizing the townsfolk including participating in a gang rape of a young couple who were trying to escape the gang's warpath. The gang have also declared war on the MFP in revenge for Nightrider's death and as such Goose is targeted. Goose is burnt alive after he crashes the ute he borrows to take his sabotaged motorbike back to base after the gang members set a trap to ambush Goose. Disillusioned with the police force and the war on the streets, Max resigns and takes his wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel) and his young son Sprog (Brendan Heath) on a road trip far away. When Toecutter and the gang brutally murders Max's family, a rage filled Max swears revenge on the gang and takes the law into his own hands, firstly by suiting up back into his police uniform, and with a sawn-off shotgun and a supercharged black Pursuit Special that he has taken from the police garage.There is a lot to like about Max Max. The story is kept simple yet the action scenes are very kinetic and thrilling, fully engaging audiences. For a low budget movie, it has garnered a lot of popularity.Mel Gibson is great as Max Rockatansky, the well liked and good hearted police officer who slowly through the movie is worn down by the carnage and later when his family is murdered, he is no longer the same person he used to be, his rage turning him into a ruthless and cold blooded man. Mad Max is easily one of Mel Gibson's best movies, along with Mad Max 2 (1981), Lethal Weapon (1987), and Braveheart (1995), and it is such a shame that Mel Gibson's reputation has been severely damaged with recent events including his infamous arrest for drink driving and his anti-semantic insults in 2006 along with allegations of domestic violence in 2010.Hugh Keays-Byrne as Toecutter, the leader of the gang, made a great villain. Randomly making up his own dialogue from the top of his head as well as carrying a sadistic presence about him, the Toecutter strikes fear into the hears of many adversaries and other townsfolk.Steve Bisley as the charismatic and cocky motorcycle officer Goose has also gone onto forge a stellar career on Australian Film and TV with shows such as Police Rescue and Water Rats.Hats off to George Miller for a tremendous job with turning a low budget movie into a highly successful movie along with a successful series.Before you see Mad Max: Fury Road on cinemas or any of the other sequels, you must watch the first Mad Max.Mad Max is highly recommended for all fans of Mel Gibson, action fans, those that enjoy a good car chase, and lovers of Australian cinema. You'd be mad not to check out Mad Max.9/10.",Mad Max
136,rajatdahiyax,Need to watch the sequels to get more of it!!!!!!,6,15 March 2015,"This stunning, post-apocalyptic action thriller from director George Miller stars Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky, a policeman in the near future who is tired of his job. Since the apocalypse, the lengthy, desolate stretches of highway in the Australian outback have become bloodstained battlegrounds. Max has seen too many innocents and fellow officers murdered by the bomb's savage offspring, bestial marauding bikers for whom killing, rape, and looting is a way of life. He just wants to retire and spend time with his wife and son but lets his boss talk him into taking a peaceful vacation and he starts to reconsider. Then his world is shattered as a gang led by the evil Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) murders his family in retaliation for the death of one of its members. Dead inside, Max straps on his helmet and climbs into a souped-up V8 racing machine to seek his bloody revenge. Despite an obviously low budget and a plot reminiscent of many spaghetti Westerns, Mad Max is tremendously exciting, thanks to some of the most spectacular road stunts ever put on film. Cinematographer David Eggby and stunt coordinator Grant Page did some of their best work under Miller's direction and crafted a gritty, gripping thrill ride which spawned two sequels, numerous imitations, and made Mel Gibson an international star. One sequence, in which a man is chained to a car and must cut off a limb before the machine explodes is one of the most tense scenes of the decade. The American version dubbed all the voices -- including Gibson's -- in a particularly cartoonish manner. Trivia buffs should note that Max's car is a 1973 Ford Falcon GT Coupe with a 300 bhp 351C V8 engine, customized with the front end of a Ford Fairmont and other modifications.",Mad Max
137,rooee,Superbly simple,7,12 April 2010,"Mad Max 2 is the better film, for sure: it's bigger, grislier, and more exciting. But the original is very good not just because it explains why Max is perturbed, but because it does so without compromising his character's silent and innate masculinity - which is some feat considering the amount of skin-tight leather on show.Max himself - skilfully underplayed by Mel Gibson - is at the heart of all the main narrative turns. It's he who kills the Nightrider; his best friend who's murdered by the gang that wants to get to him; his family who are targeted for the final showdown. And yet Max is on screen quite rarely. Not that he needs to be seen: he is an archetype of sorts; the last spring of morality in an apocalyptic desert.Thanks to a tight and sympathetic script, Max and Jessie's relationship is entirely convincing. The music, by Brian May (no, not that one), is superbly melodramatic; always complementary, never intrusive.It's not complex. At one point Max tells his boss that if he spends any more time on the road he'll ""be one of them"" - we know what territory we're in, and it's not about blurring moral boundaries; it's about raw, red-blooded revenge.",Mad Max
138,jonathan-577,Disappointing,6,11 July 2007,"I just read this interview with Miller where he says he was too embarrassed to watch Mad Max and it's nothing like he wanted it to be and he only agreed to make Road Warrior to have another kick at it. And while filmmakers are always saying stuff like that, I admit that this time I know what he's talking about. As cinema, it should go without saying, this is head and shoulders above what it should be - taut, kinetic, and off-kilter, although actually some of the early stunt work is edited to unconvincing effect and the ending is way too abrupt. But take away the atmosphere and the exotic vistas, both genuine selling points, and this is Death Wish LXXIX: another wronged macho man wreaks revenge on another buncha 'punks.' It's not good-versus-evil, because the cops are shown to be corrupted by their line of work. But knee in groin notwithstanding, the females are extremely weak; and instead of RW's flamboyant otherworldly crazies, the best these bad guys can do is a smattering of butch bisexuality (Toecutter actually looks a bit like Craig Russell). I think that Miller is smarter than this movie and learned the traps by falling into them. But there they are.",Mad Max
139,tankace,Cult classic action flick of the seventies with a tough of post apocalypse and how to make a low budget film.,7,11 January 2017,"Having reviewed already the later installment of the Mad Max series it is high time to review the original trilogy of this cult series that has left such an impact to our global culture. The first of them was Mad Max of 1979 a film that also, was among many other of the late seventies that brought the Australian cinema to the spotlight.For starter the film had, for twenty years in the role ,the highest box office to budget ratio and was award multiple awards for its effects, directing and in general its style as a whole. Even nowadays people modify their cars in order to be like them ones of the film. What also is a fun fact about that film it that the majority of the stunt doubles and drivers of the vehicles ,they were paid for the labor with beer. No, for real I didn't make this up the pay many of them with some dollars and a six-pack! Granted it doesn't sound such a bad of an idea.All these fun facts end to one single fact about the directorial debut of George Miller and Mel Gibson. It was really low budget, to be precise the film cost 350 to 400 thousand Australian dollar which was roughly around 180000 to 200000 us dollars, so the crew was forced to be crafty. One of the methods they used to save on the budget was to call real motor gangs for the shooting for the criminals of the film (don't wary the real-life motorcyclist aren't psychos), directing everywhere they could without gaining first permission in order to not to pay for the needed permit, the so called guerrilla film-making . And the crazy part is that the Victoria Police actually found them out and intend of arresting them they help them by closing roads for them to do their work with out any third person been put in danger.But for me it isn't a perfect film for it is often corny and over the top. Some stunts are quit obviously faked, although the ones they real happen are quit cool. And my last negative is that the post-apocalypse part isn't so big in the film even though so many films of this genre have took inspiration of it.All in all if you like it, good for you ,if you didn't like then at least respect it for its legacy and as for the action and dystopia part, the next installment was way more in to that.",Mad Max
140,Scars_Remain,One of the Best Revenge Films Ever Made,10,9 February 2008,"If revenge is a sub-genre, it's my favorite one. This is definitely one of the best revenge flicks I've ever seen and also one of the most enjoyable films in general. I think it's definitely an underrated film that deserves more recognition because of how it basically shaped the whole post-apocalyptic genre. This is one that I'm sad I didn't see sooner.This may be my favorite performance from Mel Gibson, he does such a fantastic job. The story is pretty simple but a revenge plot doesn't have any need to be complex. It's very obvious that a lot of films today have taken inspiration from Mad Max, and if you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.If you're a junkie for revenge films like I am, you owe it to yourself to see this amazing depiction. Just sit back and enjoy it for a what it is. A true film classic!",Mad Max
141,Cinema_Fan,Australia's finest moment in cinema: Sheer brilliance.,8,11 February 2007,"Mad Max: George Miller and James McCausland's vision of an apocalyptic future set in the wastelands of Australia. Total social decay is just around the corner in this spectacular low budget gang orientated road movie. Where the cops do their best to lay down the law and the outlaw gangs try their hardest to defy the system. Leather clad cop Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson), the husband and father to a beautiful family turns judge, juror and executioner for the tragic deaths of his best friend, wife and baby at the hands of a wandering biker gang. Here we see the final days of normality of a man who had everything to live for, and his slip into the abyss of madness.This is Australian cinema, yet again, at its finest, at its peak, with Australian classics as Muriel's Wedding (1994), The Dish (2000), Ghosts... of the Civil Dead (1988), Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), Razorback (1984), Romper Stomper (1992) and Two Hands (1999), never has there been a most successful movie franchise as there has with Mad Max.Along with a relatively new cast and crew, this is a movie that would propel the young Mel Gibson to superstardom. Also, in the course of time Mad Max would conceive two younger siblings, again directed by George Miller, in the guise of Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985), and with the possibility of a fourth chapter in the pipe-line.Brain May, Australian born and guitarist to the band Queen has composed a score that relays the nature of the horrors of both decline and decay.With its astounding car stunts, unbelievable bike chases and constant ultra violence Mad Max is the antihero on the road to vengeance and self-oblivion.Road movies with this much calibre and guts just don't come around that often, here we have Max, an honest family man whose life is torn apart by the result of a nihilistic nomad biker gang and their evil murderous way's. While the story line may just make the grade, it is the interesting and dark characters and their surroundings that project an air of dread, with its pessimistic intent that portrays a society slowly on the verge of imploding in on itself.The police are the last remaining vestige of what is left of a once fruitful world of safety and conformity, we are forever indebted to these heroes, these Knights of the road, theirs is the perpetual struggle against corruption, bureaucracy and the peoples overall fear of the gangs that populate the streets and roads. It is in this struggle that George Miller and Byron Kennedy has foreseen the coming of the end.Mad Max relies on the narrative of the traditional car and bike chase, beautifully filmed, with its more than exciting adrenaline ride to enhance the pace and sheer realism. Filmed up-close and personal, at gutter and bumper levels, this is high speed, high octane lunacy. Mad Max is more than just stunts, through its destructive mayhem, it can be perceived as a statement of chaos and anarchy that dwells in the shadows, a social comment of the lunatics taking over the asylum.",Mad Max
142,coldwaterpdh,Damn cool.,7,12 October 2009,"Just finished ""Mad Max"" for the first time.I am one of those dudes who has probably seen every knock-off, but never the original. After countless Castellari's, Fulci's and Martino's depicting the post apocalypse, this one definitely stands strong as the first.I was hoping that the revenge aspect of the plot would last longer. It seemed to end too quickly. It sort of reminded me of ""I Spit On Your Grave"" in that way; a person endures an hour or so of torture and injustice and the viewer only gets a few minutes of glory afterward. We root for Max a little too much, only to be somewhat let down.I did like the part when that semi flattens and dismembers that one guy though. Pretty awesome.The Australian setting and accents give this one a unique and welcome touch.7 out of 10, kids.",Mad Max
143,GeorgeRoots,"""When The Gangs Take Over The Highway... ...Remember He's On Your Side"".",7,25 May 2015,"One of the most financially successful movies of its time (With a Guinness world record to prove it), the original ""Mad Max"" (1979) would go on to gross 100 million US dollars on a 400,000 Australian dollar budget. Director George Miller was particularly interested in making a film based on his experience as a medical doctor in Sydney hospital, and screenwriter James McCausland drew particular influence from the 1973 oil crisis. Easily similar to any Roger Corman feature at the time (Most obviously 1975's ""Death Race 2000""), Mad Max's stunt work continues to pack a punch even today with a style that spawned an extremely popular series of movies.Set in the near future, the MFP (Main Force Patrol) are losing control and jurisdiction over renegade motorcycle gangs who have taken the Australian outback. The top cop Max Rockatansky (A then unknown Mel Gibson), poses a serious threat to these gangs led by the villainous ""Toecutter"" (A delightfully over the top performance by Hugh Keays-Byrne). As the MFP fight a losing battle will Max be able to stop this madness around him, or will certain events sadly consume him?Miller and producer Byron Kennedy went hardcore independent in order to finance the flick, with actual biker gangs making up most of the extras and the destruction of the cars all had to be done in one take (There's an absolute plethora of movie trivia I'd advise you to check out). Acting here is unfortunately hit and miss, but then again the casting of bikers and unknown actors speaks for itself. Mel Gibson is a great actor who somewhat fell into the role during casting, but here he is still growing and somewhat fails to convince me here and there. Saying that, he does hold up well considering this is the only film in the series where Max really talks often and faces severe trauma. Hugh Keays-Byrne's wonderful performance just makes me laugh, but I'll say it hear proudly that all the villains of Max's world are somewhat highly campy and certainly eccentric.Upon release the response was highly controversial, according to Wikipedia: ""The Australian social commentator and film producer Phillip Adams condemned Mad Max, saying that it had ""all the emotional uplift of Mein Kampf"" and would be ""a special favourite of rapists, sadists, child murderers and incipient Charles Mansons"". What is even stranger to me was that the Australian dialogue was dubbed for the American release and the original audio wasn't re-issued until 2000.Final Verdict: The pacing falters here and there, but if there's anything definitive to say about the original ""Mad Max"", it's that the stunts are great, Miller certainly knows how to up the madness and Australian composer Brian May creates a fantastic Bernard Herrmann-ish soundtrack. 7/10. It's a hell of a debut movie, but who knew that George Miller would eventually outdo himself and create one of the best action movies of all time with ""The Road Warrior"" (1981).",Mad Max
144,flingebunt,"When the big budgets take over the cinemas, remember George Miller is on your side.",9,24 June 2004,"There was once a young Intern working in the emergency wards in Australia. He was shocked by the amount of violence he was seeing. Not the violence of guns and knives, but of cars. The drivers, hoons and police alike seemed to have a death wise.So Dr George Miller gave up his medical career to found Australia's most successful production company, become an internationally acknowledged director and make a little film called Mad Max.Mel Gibson (he looks very young in this movie) plays a bronze. That is a police officer. Society is collapsing, violence and mayhem is everywhere. ""People don't believe in hero's any more Max, but you and me, we are going to give them back their heros.""But Max is sick of the violence on the roads. He finds he is beginning to enjoy the game of death. But he has a wife and child.When they are killed he goes over the edge, taking the last of the V-8s the serves high octane justice.All this was done on a tiny budget. I am a huge fan of low budget films. But this movie doesn't look low budget. Plenty of spectacular car crashes, explosions and crazy 70s gang type villains (I always suspect a lot of 1970s villains are just hippies turned bad). It has non-stop action....and the opening scence is the best....worth watching only that part.One of the best action movies ever made and the best car movies made.Loved by motorheads the world over, the series is worshiped in Somalia (a country where the gangs ride around in cars patched together from spare parts and provide the only rule in a world turned to Anarchy...they even write Mad Max References on the side of their cars...called mechanicals), but it is also a vilification of the love of cars and the culture of speed and violence. Remember this is the same director who did ""The year my voice broke"" and ""Lorenzo's oil"".One more fact.....many of the bit parts are played by Australian Actors who appeared in children's educational TV shows I used to watch when I was young.

148,dk77dk,Mad Max Rules The Roads,10,14 December 2020,"Mad Max is a brutal, dark story about loss and revenge.Cinematography, details and photography are excellent. Everything looks real and stunts are amazing.Mad Max is not only a story of revenge, but also an indicator of how loss affects some people and what it does to their psyche. There are evil people who feed on the suffering of others and if there are no people like Max Rockatansky to protect those who cannot fight for themselves, the world becomes a very dark place.A very good account of what would happen if anarchy and the absence of law occurred. When Max goes for revenge, nothing can stop him until the last villain is destroyed.The film looks realistic and brutal, it is a real rarity to see something like this. The director managed to make an exceptional film with fantastic action scenes, tense car chases and truly brutal and grotesque violence. This is a great example of how a brilliant director can make a great and powerful film with a small budget, which in this case has turned into a classic. An exceptional cinematic masterpiece.Particularly impressive are the scenes in which the director emphasizes the tension with simple shots and makes them spectacular. There's no CGI here, of course, because the film was shot in 1979, which makes it even more impressive. Truly brilliant directing.Mel Gibson is perfect as Max Rockatansky. Hugh Keays-Byrne is fascinating as Toecutter, after all, as is the entire motorcycle gang. A whole gallery of bizarre and hilarious characters who are fun and disgusting at the same time.The photography is fascinating and the directing is flawless.A cult classic.",Mad Max
149,patriciogl10,Amazing things can be done with a small budget.,8,26 October 2019,"Mad Max was the first effort that launch a great franchise that still continues to release audiovisual products to this day. So obviously something was done right from the start. Even though at first, it appears as if the first twenty minutes are something of a lesser The Warriors, with whom both share some similarities. After that brief amount of time, the film starts to gain its own identity with scenes that evoke thrilling sensations and Mel Gibson's Max's distress and concern about his family's well-being. Then, it's an exciting ride full of intense action that when you think about how low the budget was for this production, it intensifies the achievement accomplished in this Australian production.Kudos to George Miller for bringing to life an amazing piece of action cinema with nothing but blood, sweat and tears. Mad Max is a mandatory view.",Mad Max

151,thenolanfan,Review - Mad Max,7,6 April 2020,"First, The villains are excellent, their motivations aren't obvious which obviously is not usually a good point, but in this case, you can assume that their only goal is to cause pain. This makes them only more despicable, and that is a good point for an action movie. The movie contains some pretty innovative concepts in terms of car chases that would later be developed to their full potential in Mad Max: Fury Road. However, even with all those good aspects and the pretty entertaining story, you can't deny that the screenplay of this movie is pure garbage, it contains only a few bad lines of dialog and the story while as I said entertaining is simply a pretext for a revenge plot.To conclude, I recommend this movie for the entertaining aspect and the cultural impact that it had especially in Australia, but avoid it if you expect a movie with a strongly coherent plot.",Mad Max
152,AndreiPavlov,Madly sad movie,10,2 May 2006,"Spoiler: Shall not be writing three different reviews on the three parts of this movie, but will just post all the three identical ones to each title (a rare thing, but this movie deserves it). To me all the three parts are one solid insane movie: ""Mad Max"".It's a downright mad movie. Sad and sick. The landscape makes all the actions look wild and post-apocalyptic (desert, vultures, endless roads, spooky forests, primitive living conditions, vacant beaches, and crazy freaks on wheels). It was one hell of a movie to watch in my earlier years. My reaction to this extravaganza was swift: a table game with the plot line taken out of the third part of the movie was created (one was to complete it by throwing the dices).Now, as quite a lot of time has passed, there is an urge to watch it every year.Thankfully, there was a chance for me to watch this insane trilogy back in 1989 or 1990 all the way through from the first installation to the very last at a local ""videozal"". Some girl had a few words to say before pushing the VHS into the player. She said something like: ""During the movie there will be about 3 minutes of silence somewhere in the middle, don't be surprised. The sound will come to normal after that"". How do you find it? Great commentary before airing a great movie! If it were a run-of-the-mill action, who would care at all about some minutes in the middle of something? But here we all were missing the sound because we soaked up the insane atmosphere of those sick characters' deeds on the screen.How many films, which have strong follow-ups, can be named? Not many, and ""Mad Max"" is definitely among them. It was as revolutionary as ""The Matrix"" but had great parts 2 and 3, too. The first movie does have the Australian soundtrack indeed.And one more thing: if someone calls this film stupid, don't take these words for granted. Among the entertaining, bizarre, mad, and at the same time clever action movies this one is an absolute hydra-king (with three enjoyable incarnations). Don't you see the warning to our human race, which goes in the form of demented ""motorheads""? Don't you feel the doom hanging over people that have no power to resist the evil forces? Don't you see the emptiness of human existence in a high-tech world that is built upon pain and broken lives? Don't you smell the gas of future, ready to blow up?After all these words it is clear as the blue sky of Australia that the mark is 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.",Mad Max

I read the back of the video cassette which was very thorough (probably through demand) in the storyline & filled me in. That clarified things but not really to an extent where it made sense. Awful acting from Mel in what tiny dialogue he or the film does have. I wasn't giving it 110% concentration throughout, even so I must be really thick as I wasn't aware it post-apocalyptic until I came on here, nor am I sure what happened to Toe-Cutter or Mel's wife & if they're dead or not?2/10",Mad Max
154,ivanmessimilos,Cult classic,8,21 June 2020,"Rare are the films for which most will use big words like the cult classic. However, if you say that about this movie, you won't go wrong.
Since the movie is from 1979, there will be a spoiler below, so if you haven't seen the movie by chance (then why are you still reading this ?!) be careful.Where to start? It would be completely wrong to tell someone a short story, because the film has such a simple story that you will practically retell the entire film of ninety minutes in two extended sentences.Many people don't like this movie (there are subjectively perhaps too low 6.9 on imdb) and on the one hand I can understand them. The plot is simple, the characters are not too developed and the film falls into the low budget category (some $ 350,000). But we need to look at the bigger picture. Given that a good portion of the film falls on car races, motorbikes, explosions and collisions then this gained weight.The action takes place in the near future (as the caption at the beginning of the film tells us), and (a small number) citizens are terrorized by disturbed gangs with fast engines and cars that do whatever they want. There is also a law enforcement unit called the MFP which is actually the police trying to stop these savages however unsuccessfully because even when they manage to catch and arrest someone, a trial does not take place because everyone is afraid to show up and testify and then have to be released. The main character is played by the then completely unknown Mel Gibson and I must say that he did a terrible job. He didn't get a lot of material or time, but he managed to dominate. Max changes through the film, first he is a family man who is happy with his wife and child, then he is dissatisfied with his job and system (even prophetically telling the boss that the only difference between him and violent gangs is a badge) he resigns after the gang sets his colleague on fire , and at the very end broken, mad and totally different ends up as the wreck of a former law representative after a great family tragedy. He quickly steals a black car, puts on his black police suit again and embarks on a revenge campaign. Interestingly, Max only becomes Mad in the last ten minutes of the film, I believe there are a certain amount of people who don't like this.
There is one shorter but famous scene (at least to me), when after the gang kills his wife and small child (technically the woman did not die but is in serious condition after amputation and major organ damage, but in the following it is said that she died), he sits broken holding a mask in his hand, which he used to scare the woman, so he crumples it with his hands. It is the key moment when he becomes a man who has lost absolutely everything and thirsts only for revenge, that is the moment when he became Mad Max.
The main villain is the so-called Toecutter (interestingly how the same actor plays the main villain in the 2015 film Mad Max Fury Road), the leader of a gang that contains drugs that take drugs, steal fuel, attack, rape (women and men), almost in general with dolls from the shop window, mostly the biggest bullies and lunatics.The ending of the film remained deeply etched in my memory back when I first watched the film in elementary school. After Max caught and killed the whole gang (he seriously injured his leg by the way after they ambushed him and shot him, then crossed the engine over his arm), the last one left was Johnny Boy (this is the one they had to let go because no one he did not want to testify) to whom he puts handcuffs on the ankle for a burning car that leaks fuel, gives him a saw and a difficult choice: he can cut the handcuffs in 10 minutes or the ankle in 5 minutes (if he is lucky). Then he leaves without looking back at Johnny's screams, gets in his car and drives off, while we see an explosion in the distance. Awesome ending!Even after 30+ years, the film leaves a strong impression, as well as great scenes of chases and collisions, considering the money invested. Sometimes it can be seen visually that not a lot of money was invested in the film, but to me it is stupid to see it as a flaw. Same thing as someone criticizing some older movie for worse special effects. It neither makes sense nor is it fair.
Filmed entirely in Australia, with Australian actors, and director Miller got the most out of it in just 12 weeks by filming his vision of the future on a small budget.Mad Max remains a must-watch for all movie lovers to which we always return.",Mad Max

Oscar nominations, I wanted to catch up on things before seeing the new film at the Cineplex. I was very pleased with this early film in the post-apocalyptic movie category, and can see how and why both it and star Mel Gibson became so successful. Other than Kenneth Anger's experimental film, 'Scorpio Rising', I have never seen a work that so fetishes both cars and the ritual of dressing, either for driving or for war. It's very well directed and suspenseful for a first-timer in Miller, and I'm so glad he's still helming the films of the series 36 years later! All that one has to do to see How To and How Not To Continue a Fine Franchise is compare how both George Miller and George Lucas have done this century. It's sad that they were so short on funds that only Gibson could be fitted with real leather in the film--I think I can rightly assume that money isn't a problem anymore...",Mad Max

A very young Gibson gets a break-in role and off his career goes, with several sequel type movies quickly following... Synopsis: Max and a few 'rougher' type law enforcement officers try to maintain some somnolence of law & order in the lawless Australian outback where gangs do what gangs do, murder, rape, rob, destroy, etc. Max's job calls for him to be equally ruthless on occasion and his only attachment to 'real' life, normal life, & sanity are his close friends, his wife, and child. When Toecutter and his motorcycle gang burn his best friend to death and murder his wife and child Max goes out for revenge and the war is on.

Its plot is about a cop who's tired of his job and wants to retire. After he kills a member of a gang, the other members try to get revenge on him and his family. The rest of the film, he has to survive them. The movie has a barren and rundown environment which draws the viewer into it. Mel Gibson did a great performance as a man whose tired of being a cop because he's seen way too many cops die. The movie takes a dark turn at the end and it makes one of the most memorable movie scenes of the decade. Its choice makes it into a cult classic. I do feel that it slowed down a bit at the middle though. In that time, we got to know the characters but I would've rather seen more action.

I've great things about all four movies. But this first entire it was. it was, it was, boring! In a dystopic future Australia, a vicious biker gang murder a cop's family and make his fight with them personal. The film opens with a car chase where we get introduced to Max who takes down this psychopath who calls himself the Knight Rider. The rest of the Knight Rider clan show up to take their revenge. Their were a lot of good stuff in this film, the acting is pretty good, the score is amazing, and the action is pretty okay. I was expecting something simplistic and grander then what I got. I believe it should of been like Punisher where you see his family get axed in the beginning or maybe they have that opening sequence but instead that knight rider from the beginning kills his wife and son and then the rest of the knight riders show up to take their revenge. I don't know I like a lot of things about this movie as I've stated but after that opening sequence I just felt bored. Until then the knight riders showed up and terrorized a couple, then they killed Maxes family and he takes revenge.

Though it's sequels were made on bigger budged and are more known (seriously, I know some people who have seen The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, but didn't know that Mad Max first part exist), this film is good in it's own way. Civilisation has started to fall and it's becoming unsafe for a normal people to live in this world. Motorcyle gangs who's members are all sorts of maniacs are terrorizing them. This film is made in western spirit and like in westerns the bandits looked always comfortable in all situations, never caring about nothing. The characters were pretty colorful, though in second part there were more colorful characters but in this film they looked creepier. Probably my favorite gang member was Bubba Zanetti (Geoff Parry). There were some violent scenes where gang members are terrorizing people and it gave this film a creepy atmosphere. The car chase scenes was nothing compare to nowadays movies, but still I was surprised how could they make them look so good on such a low budged.",Mad Max
160,rhinocerosfive-1,man made inhuman by inhumanity,9,13 July 2007,"Two sadistic gangs terrorize turn-of-apocalypse Australia. The Bronze are pretty bad, though handicapped by being cops. The Toecutter's crew, unfettered by legality, kills babies and rapes teenagers. Hugh Keays-Byrne gives an epic, asphalt-chewing performance as the biker boss, and Mel Gibson doesn't scourge any Jews for the entire movie. In fact he does very little except drive a car, which is good, because as effective an actor as he later became, he was not there yet in '79.One of the finest of the violent cop movies, comparable to the better works of Frankenheimer, Friedkin, Takeshi and Siegel. This time the genre is viewed through the comic strip glass of car chase as adrenaline art. A model of efficient and resourceful film making, MAD MAX is about low angles and wide lenses as much as it's about anything - long shots of the road stretching to vanishing point as things are run over. It comes as close as TWO LANE BLACKTOP to the intimacy of a Detroit roadburner at 100 mph. Also features excellent high-speed motorcycle photography, and great ingenuity and skill on the part of the special-effects and stunt workers. Probably the most important technical element is the extensive shot vocabulary of two relatively inexperienced men, George Miller and David Eggby - one of the great fades in movie history shows Max becoming a machine, quietly morphing into a mindless, vengeful robot-car-thing without the aid of a computer. And the sound is a busy marvel - engine, transmission, and running gear compete with burning rubber, ranting degenerates, and screaming women and children. Who die.But these are only a few of the cheap thrills churned up by this near-perfect exercise in boys' entertainment. We also get two philosophical villains, a well-realized gang of amusing, sexually omnivorous thugs, several absurd psychotic policemen, and an abundance of cartoonish sound and music stingers, many commingling brass horns and bleating crows. True, obligatory cop movie chestnuts (dead partner, montage with loving wife, attempt to quit the force) are included; but this picture may be most notable for what it does not contain: more than a few actual deaths, any nudity to speak of, and, least missed of all, a ragged family of dirty-faced weak people in need of Messiah. The larger-budgeted sequels, and entries by Costner, Diesel et al, trade blatantly and boringly on the desperation of refugee society, as this movie does subtly, subversively. Those pictures spend a lot of downtime with the least photogenic, least interesting, least likely to go fast or explode part of the cast; and unlike MAD MAX, those movies do not earn their thrills, because their peril is disingenuous. The Feral Kid in ROAD WARRIOR is never, for a second, in danger, not really; he's a carrot we'll never bite. This though is a thoroughly unregenerate b movie, the kind you couldn't make for distribution in the US today; this movie lives and breathes moving vehicles, crashed by dynamic characters, most of whom come equipped with a death wish.",Mad Max
161,robsta23,Watching the Originals Before Fury Road - Didn't Start off Well,5,31 May 2015,"The original Mad Max is a sloppy film that takes on a strange style. It has an editing pace that feels way too fast during the action sequences, its score sounds like something out of the Batman show starring Adam West, and its story just really is not that engaging at all.The plot of the movie is basically that this biker gang tries to take on Max and the other policemen, or members of ""The Bronze,"" to avenge their friend, nicknamed ""Nightrider."" Of course, Max's family is hunted simultaneously since attacking the heart is a great and frequent strategy in movies which involve rivalries.This movie could have been made to be more dramatic if in lingered on certain moments instead of rushing through them. The editing pace is so fast - and rather strange at times - that we barely see the ""actions,"" but more of the explosive aftermaths. Nightrider dies early in the film in an explosive wreck, but the few shots leading up to the explosion are so abrupt we can barely tell what happens. This reminds me of one of the shots in Batman Begins which bothers me - it is a shot where a cop lets out a yell of some sort before running into something - it feels so unnecessary in the film since it only lasts a few frames. That's how the shots in the action sequences of Mad Max feel to me. Other than that, some choices of editing seem to rush into the closeups rather than establish the space of the scene, and it is an odd result - such an example is when cops are chasing Nightrider at the beginning, and the film cuts between the cop car driving left to right and the car Nightrider is driving (also left to right) which seems to be an identical shot, but fails to establish that Nightrider is in front of those cops.This wasn't a terrible film, but I expected to be more engaged in the film than I actually was. All I can say is I'm on my way to watching Fury Road, which I am excited for since it is getting great reviews and doesn't look like this film at all, even though it is part of the same series and has the same director.",Mad Max

164,fredschaefer-406-623204,"The one and only original Max, still as great as it ever was.",10,11 February 2020,"The original MAD MAX, the movie that started it all, still holds up, and you can't say that about every classic from back in the day, especially an action film dependent on stunts and effects that have only gotten bigger and grander in the years since its release in 1979, just watch the FAST AND FURIOUS franchise to see what I am talking about. Not only does Max and his bad company hold up, it is still one of the great thrill rides in cinema, a visceral experience, even on repeat viewings. Though considered a classic of the action genre, which it redefined, it remains one of the finest mash ups of action and scifi, along with outright horror. MAD MAX has one foot firmly in one of the '70s most conspicuous genres - the vigilante cop film, an eclectic group that includes everything from DIRTY HARRY to WALKING TALL. In story structure, MAX very much resembles a classic western with the forces of law and order doing battle with a gang of outlaws, just switch out horses for Ford Falcons and motorcycles. It also went a long way toward establishing the post apocalyptic dystopia genre that is still with us, just watch any season of THE WALKING DEAD, and you can find a few tropes that MAX made popular - how much different are Negan and the Governor from The Toecutter, Lord Humongous, and Auntie Entity? And of course, MAD MAX is a legitimate contender for the greatest car chase movie of all time, another '70s subgenre that began with BULLITT and THE FRENCH CONNECTION and went on to SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT among many others. In fact, by the end of the decade, critics were complaining loudly about how tired they were of hearing squealing tires and seeing vehicles crash, just read any contemporary review of THE BLUES BROTHERS. If anything, MAX reinvigorated, and reinvented, a tired cliché, and gave it new life.Though it is remembered as the film that put Mel Gibson on everyone's radar, looking back, it is obvious the true star of MAD MAX is George Miller, the former Australian MD turned Down Under movie director. It's Miller who infused the script with his own real life experiences from working in an emergency room, and observing his countrymen's violent reaction to gasoline shortages in the early '70s where violent fights erupted when someone tried to cut in the long lines at gas stations. It also helped that Australia had a vigorous car culture as well. The script, written by Miller and producer, Byron Kennedy, is a masterpiece of economical storytelling, produced on a budget coming in under $500,000 (Miller and Kennedy had to put up some of their own cash), with principle shooting taking place around Melbourne in late 1977 and early 1978. Some of the shoot legitimately qualified as ""guerilla film making"" as they did not have permits to set up cameras at some of the locations, although by all reports, the Victoria police proved to be quite cooperative. It was Miller's use of widescreen and panning in establishing shots, and more importantly, mounting cameras on fenders, along with tight editing that made the film such a stunning experience, not mention a classic of visual storytelling. During the many chase scenes, we feel like we are truly there with Max, or the Goose, or the hapless victims of the villains. We ride right along with Toecutter and his gang, all but sharing the fate of some character just before impact obliterates them - who can forget the image of eyes bulging in their sockets with the realization of imminent death. Brian May's score seldom gets mentioned when the film is discussed, but with its echoes of Bernard Herrmann's best work for Hitchcock, it is essential to the film's success.The film itself clocks in just over a tight hour and half, and I am forever impressed with the way Miller seamlessly changes moods, and genres, from one scene to the other. The opening, where the harried police (called The Bronze), chase down the out of control Nightrider (""I'm a fuel injected suicide machine"") along the two lane black tops, is an action film masterpiece, while introducing two of the main protagonists, the up for anything Jim Goose, and the quieter, but very competent, Max Rockatansky. There are few other films, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK might be the exception, that hit the ground running better. But very soon the villains of the piece show up to claim the remains of their fallen comrade, and terrorize a small community in the process - just like Brando and his gang in THE WILDD ONE. This culminates with one innocent bystander dragged to his death behind a motorcycle, and a young man and a girl being chased down and gang raped. When one of the younger members of the gang is arrested by Goose, a series of increasingly deadly confrontations are set in motion, with many casualties, and lots of collateral damage, until only two characters remain. And then there is one, who rides away into the sequel. While we just remember the incredible action scenes, equally memorable are the domestic scenes between Max and his wife Jessie and their toddler son. Played by Jeanne Samuels, Jessie is such a great wife; she and Mel Gibson make a wonderful couple. It is essential that we understand what Max loses when the Toecutter's gang catches up with them, and his family's horrible fate (that much worse because we don't see the graphic details) haunts him through all the subsequent films. And the seamless switch between genres is never more evident than in the sequence where Jessie walks through the woods to the beach, gradually becoming aware that she is not alone - this is right out of a horror film. This leads to a finale, where Max hunts down those who have destroyed his family, and gets his revenge; one of the finest, most suspenseful, and tightly edited action sequences to be found anywhere. There are few films that have a stronger third act than MAD MAX. Then we come full circle back to horror in the climax between Max and Johnny the Boy, which directly influenced SAW.One of the reasons why MAD MAX works so well is that while it has a great appealing hero in the young early 20s Mel Gibson, it also has some spectacularly nasty villains. Bubba Zenetti, Cundalini, Johnny the Boy, and their leader The Toecutter, are not only punk sadists, but there is a strong suggestion of sexual degeneracy (long a plot device by writers to make readers hate the bad guys more) rampant among them. ""Push me, shove you, says who?"" that, and the strongly implied rape of a boy and girl by the gang, not to mention the fey Toecutter's strong interest in Johnny the Boy, are a striking contrast to the straight arrow Max, and his happy home life with Jessie. All this is due to the fine acting by Hugh Keays-Byrne as the smirking, sadistic, one eye browed Toecutter, and Tim Burns' smarmy Johnny, a clear cousin to Andy Robinson's Scorpio from DIRTY HARRY. What is also so striking now is how well MAD MAX plays off the deep anxieties of the late '70s, the era of the energy crisis, rampant inflation and low economic growth, the fall of South Vietnam, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the rise of the Ayatollah. World events seemed to be sliding toward some kind of disaster, either economic or an outright world war - maybe both - with no political leadership capable of turning things around. The opening of the film says that it is set a few years into the future, where the situation has only gotten worse. Some reviewers state that MAD MAX takes place in the aftermath of a nuclear exchange between the super powers, but that is more clearly stated in the immediate sequel, THE ROAD WARRIOR, where civilization has vanished entirely. I think the original film happens in a world where there has been an economic meltdown, where governments have gone broke, especially local ones, where an under manned police work out of a burned out HQ, allowing criminal gangs to roam with virtual impunity as the underpinnings of society crumble just a little more each day.MAD MAX was a huge hit in Australia, and worldwide, being released in America in the spring of 1980 by American International Pictures, the legendary AIP, a company well known for releasing exploitation films. Most Americans didn't know what to make of it, the poster sold it as a scifi film, and it really didn't find an audience to embrace it until the movie began running in heavy rotation on cable a year later. By the time Miller's sequel, MAD MAX 2 or THE ROAD WARRIOR, as it was known in America, was released in the fall of 1982, it was highly anticipated and became a big hit. When the third film, BEYOND THUNDERDOME (Gibson's last turn as Max), opened in the summer of 1985, it was a genuine blockbuster. But for me, there is something about the original that is still unsurpassed, it bursts with the energy of film makers who are filled with joy at the prospect of making a labor of love, and the eagerness to take chances, the kind you don't take when you are working on a big budget sequel, and having to worry about meeting fan's expectations.After the initial three films, Max went on a long hiatus, not reappearing until 2015, when MAD MAX: FURY ROAD was released, proving that he was a perfect fit for the 21st Century. Hugh Keays-Byrne was back playing the Big Bad, this time a monster named Immortan Joe, but this new Max swapped out Tom Hardy for Mel Gibson (who'd had a lot of mileage since his days as a fresh faced kid in the first movie), but George Miller was back in the director's chair, proving that time had not dimini",Mad Max
165,schroeder-gustavo,"OK Time, No more, no less",6,13 May 2015,"I think the original Mad Max gets a lot of credit because it was something fresh and innovative in 1979 and because it shows us the motivation and ""origins"" of the series'hero. But the movie feels convoluted and really drags at times. The whole movie (except perhaps for a few scenes) is predictable and feels overly long (even though it is only about 90 min). The low budget shows and the truth is, a lot in this movie makes absolutely no sense. At all.

166,chvylvr80,If you like cars you will like this movie,10,3 March 2002,"I just didn't know that a movie could kick this much ass. Mel Gibson is great in only his second onscreen role as Max Rockatansky. The other actors do a good job as well but Mel's acting combined with George Miller's brillant direction make this a film truly worth seeing. Armed with car chases and crashes galore, Mad Max is one of the best action films ever made. Shot on a shoestring budget,(George Miller used his own van in an early crash sequence) Miller has crafted cinematic gold. The real stars of the film here are the cars. Max's black interceptor is a 1974 Ford Falcon XE and every car in the film is either a Aussie Ford or a Holden Monaro. Holden is GM's Aussie subsidary and it p****s me off that they never offered them for sale to us Americans but some people just have no business sense. Max's interceptor is the coolest movie car ever and I would kill for that damn thing. Anyways, if at all possible, buy or rent this on DVD so you can see the movie with it's original Australian soundtrack. Never before heard in the US, this soundtrack sheds much new light on the film for certain lines are said much differently by the Aussie actors than by the Americans who dubbed thier lines. It brings an entirely different meaning to some of the lines spoken and I think that the film just gets better for it. Bottom line: See this movie now, go to the store, kill if you have to, and buy or rent this thing. You won't be sorry.",Mad Max
167,caseynicholson,A Dystopian Antihero Flick that Feels Like a Western,7,9 May 2015,"With ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" about to hit theaters, I decided to make it a point to watch the original last night. I'd seen bits and pieces of this movie on VHS growing up. It was always one of my Dad's favorites back in the 80's, but I think I was too young for it to hold my attention at the time. Having now seen the film, I know why my Dad--an auto mechanic and racing enthusiast who also loved westerns--would have enjoyed this movie. The film opens with a dynamic chase scene that features quite a bit of suspense. The result of this scene sets up the plot of the rest of the movie. ""Mad Max"" is a policeman in a dystopian future who winds up having a motorcycle gang out to get him. The plot basically involves the back and forth between these two entities, and proceeds fairly predictably. I enjoyed this movie just fine. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, by far, but it's watchable, albeit the setting could be a bit confusing if you don't know the background of the film going into it. The futuristic scene is never spelled out for you, so you kind of have to figure that much out on your own. And of course it's all taking place in Australia, and so the accents make it a bit of a foreign film to American ears. Still, it's enjoyable over all. It follows a standard antihero formula akin to a Clint Eastwood movie (either his westerns or the ""Dirty Harry"" movies). All in all I'd give this movie 7/10 stars. It's a bit antiquated, but a classic in its own right.",Mad Max
168,TheFilmGuy1,"A Cult Classic, But Not Particularly Well Made",8,4 October 2014,"I can totally see why Mad Max is a cult classic. It's a low budget, crazy movie. But honestly, it's just not that good. I mean, considering the low budget, they did a good job with it, but it had a lot left to be desired. Mad Max' story is sort of basic. Max kills a guy named the Nightrider and the bad guys gang comes after him. The issue is, Max doesn't feel developed enough. I couldn't tell you more than the fact that he's a badass and has a wife and kid. I also feel like every other character is under developed. The bad guys are just crazy as hell, and we don't know why other than that they are bad guys. A lot of the plot focuses on Max, and because he's under developed, the plot falls flat. But I will say he is a cool character and I do understand why sequels were made, which I plan to watch.Another thing I noticed is the setting. We know that's its years in the future, but not too far ahead. We kind of get the sense that society is a little more broken down, but not completely. They still have TV and police and restaurants and stuff. But from what I have seen of the sequels, it looks completely like an apocalyptic wasteland. There are two reasons I think that this first film doesn't seem as run down. Either their low budget didn't allow them to show the world as apocalyptic as they wanted it to be, or it's supposed to be early in the apocalypse. I think it's due to budget restraints, but I guess I will talk about that more when I review The Road Warrior. The point is, the whole world feels underdeveloped and left unexplained, confusing the viewer.Also, the music in this film is very... out of place. It sounds VERY 70's, but like some kind of music from an epic fantasy film or Star Wars. It was distracting, cheesy, and took away from a lot of the scenes.Mad Max is a cult classic, and there is some fun to be had. The last like 10 - 15 minutes are pretty cool and show that Max can be a really cool character that warrants sequels, but I have a feeling those sequels are much, much better than this one.

171,Chromium_5,"Perhaps a bit overrated, but still a good movie.",7,15 January 2005,"Although ""Mad Max"" is not as good as its sequel (which is one of the best action movies of all time), it still has quite a bit of charm on its own. It doesn't feel nearly as serious as the next one--it seems more like someone had fun making a silly biker movie, which unexpectedly became a hit. A lot of the acting is at a B-movie level (like the goofy guy at the gas station--that was just painful), and there's not a whole lot of sense to it (what is the bikers' motivation? To just be generally evil?). However, it still has some fine action sequences, and a truly awesome lead villain. And for goodness sakes, any movie with a nice old grandmother holding a biker gang hostage with a rifle is worth watching! 7/10 stars.",Mad Max
172,DeuceWild_77,"The original Ozploitation movie where it all started, a benchmark on the 'genre' and one of the best films ever made !!",10,21 October 2019,"The supreme cult classic of Ozploitation cinema, directed by the emergency room doctor turned filmmaker, George Miller, with the help of his pal, producer Byron Kennedy, from a James McCausland & George Miller himself script about a societal collapse in a not so distant future of a dystopian Australia where gangs of bikers assumed control of the roads and the Main Force Patrol (MFP) were the only hope of assuring law and order.Made on a tight budget, the movie is well known for internationalize the 'down under' cinema, as well as a benchmark on the action / car chase cinema, displaying excepcionally staged chasing scenes and car crashes with the use of some of the best stuntmen ever seen in the 'genre' at that point.The creepy and unsettling atmosphere of a vanishing point in a civilized society turned into 'every man for himself' against hordes of savages, is very well conceived both technically and artistically, much more than a futuristic western / car chase action film with a revenge motif, it's also a horror tale about a man on the way of losing his sanity, with shades of surrealism on its story and visuals.The man is Max Rockatansky, played by a mature 21 years old Mel Gibson, in a haunting performance that launched his career, a former Highway Patrolman and a family man, that no longer endures being on the road afraid of turning himself like the ones he is chasing, but when a marauder biker gang go after his best friend & partner on the Force, Jim 'Goose' Rains (played by Steve Bisley, ironically he's the one that is displayed in the movie's original cover art) and then his own wife, Jessie (Joanne Samuel) and their baby, Max turns 'Mad' and his obstinate revenge will be selvatic at the same time he starts to loose his own humanity...Hugh Keays-Byrne as the biker gang leader, the Toecutter; Geoff Parry as his second-in-command, Bubba Zanetti & Tim Burns as the crazy 'prospect', Johnny the Boy, all classic staged trained Shakespearean actors, are very good in their eerie, eccentric and malevolent performances.Roger Ward, at that time the most famous cast member on the set, is memorable as the MFP Captain, Fred ""Fifi"" Macaffee.
Ward, like his fellow cast members, Hugh Keays-Byrne and Vincent Gil (who played the lunatic 'Nightrider' at the beginning), came from an earlier Aussie biker film, ""Stone"" ('74), which like the post-apocalyptic set of ""A Boy and His Dog"" ('75), inspired George Miller on the creation of the ""Mad Max"" franchise wasteland world.Much more can be said about this masterwork, like the iconic Max's car, the Supercharged V8 - Interceptor, and its significative importance to the 'genre' cinema, and it's shameful that some of the reviewers here, are bashing this movie calling it ""episodic"", ""uneven"", ""dated"" or ""just plain bad"".Those are the new-age reviewers that discovered ""Mad Max"" because of ""Fury Road"", a badly acted, overexposed CGI borefest & soulless action flick, made in like $150 million budget, that can't even hold a candle to the effectiveness, creepiness, outlandishness of a 40 years old movie, made on just $350,000, that remains as relevant today as it was when it was released.In short, ""Mad Max"" is one of my absolutely favorite films, and my personal favorite of the first (and for my taste, the only) trilogy.""The Road Warrior"" may have been better achieved in the technical level (the budget was way improved), it's the critics' and fans' favorite and ranks even higher in the re-watchable factor, but i've always loved the world's transition and Max's character development in this original film.
I also think that the 'good guys' here, such as Goose and Fifi, are much more memorable characters than The Gyro Captain or Pappagallo in the second entry.
Now about the villains, that's another story...As a side note, this Fifi's line sums up the decaying of general cinema in this so called modern times:""They say people don't believe in heroes anymore. Well damn them! You and me, Max, we're gonna give them back their heroes!""I still believe in heroes and anti-heroes, Fifi, i've never left them !!10 / 10.",Mad Max
173,KatMiss,ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING FILMS EVER MADE,10,3 May 2001,"George Miller's ""Mad Max"" sets the tone for the rest of the series, which somehow manage to top each other. After this was ""Mad Max 2"" (called ""The Road Warrior"" for U.S. release) and ""Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome"". Each film was slicker than the previous one, but somehow, I have a real fondness for the first film that I don't have for the others.Maybe it's because it focuses on the characters, in particular, Max himself. I'm so used to the rough Mel Gibson that it's a little disarming to see him look so youthful in this film. But this was his second film (his first was a little seen gem from 1978: ""Tim"") and he had yet to fully form his current persona. We really get to see more of a human side here.  Seeing this first, one can better understand the cool and tough Max of the later films.But this isn't some character study. We also have exciting car chases and riveting action scenes. This is great stuff; it's amazing to me that after seeing endless chases in these modern megabudget studiobusters that a small, humble low budget film like ""Mad Max"" can get me so worked up. It's proof that size doesn't matter in terms of budget; it's how you do it. It's also a testament to George Miller's talents. The man just knows how to spend money efficiently and make it show on screen.Avoid the panned-and-scanned version of ""Mad Max"". It just isn't as effective when you have to pan back and forth between two cars. The Sci-Fi Network often presents ""Mad Max"" in a letterboxed version which looks great and really gives you the flavor of the Todd-Ao 35 photography. Also, I do not think the dubbing is so bad; in fact, I'd say that it is one of the best dubbing jobs I've seen, second only to the wonderful dubbing job New World did with Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers"" This could have come out like a bad Godzilla movie, but the dubbing makes the movie even BETTER, in my opinion. You can understand the actors much easier than you would in the original cut. However, this could be a different one than the one that played theatrically. I'm only judging the one on Sci-Fi.**** out of 4 stars",Mad Max

I am the rocker, I am the roller, I am the ... i am bored",5,13 November 2017,"This movie has triggered the same thoughts and feelings on me as Highlander and I have to say exactly the same in this review as in the Highlander review. Seen by two things First, I understand why this movie has become a cult here are some ideas and longings that you've never seen before, at least not in this form and certainly not in a low budget movie. You can not see George Miller having the money nor the opportunity to build all that luster, but my goodness he did everything he could and luckily he can do a lot. Secondly, I do not think I ever saw a movie made from two different films welded together and actually works. I mean, it's a post apocalyptic film about police and street gangs but the last half hour is a Revenge movie that also has other music and was filmed differently and yet, all together, it's better to have a jigsaw puzzler and give it an interesting overall picture. I can now say hard what I like better, I like revenge movies, I also love movies with gangs, police and so on but both works are not really gooood here but the stunts are. I know that one of the films is the other filmmaker well apart from the scene at the end that was copied in Saw I could not see anything special out there.",Mad Max
175,brandon_lee420,Mad Max!!,6,2 July 2010,"Title: Mad MaxDirector: George MillerAustralia has never been received very good into many foreign countries because they love the genre ""true blue"", the Australian genre that is a bunch of rubbish, but many films like Animal Kingdom and, well, there aren't many new films that come up with something new and if there was, we would have to go into the past for a film called Mad Max. This film made history as being the first Australian (tons of emphasis on that proper noun) film made with a widescreen anamorphic lens. The films also became the best Australian film......since ever, only for the simple reason of (you guessed it) it having no true blue crap. Last, but most importantly, it made Mel Gibson became an international star and this was the starting point of a journey, a very complicated and criticized journey in fact, that would rocket off a successful career in acting and directing, as well. Mad Max is a very fun to watch, especially at the end, because who doesn't love watching heroes kicking the baddies ass*s by breaking bones, crushing them, shooting at them, and getting revenge through many painful and torturous ways. If you are feeling sympathy for the baddies don't because what they did to innocent Max was uncalled for and unforgivable. They killed his wife that put a hole in his heart and killed his baby son which tore his heart out. He will make them pay for what they did because he is MAD MAX!!!! The whole plot sounds pretty stereotypical and it kind of is but the desolate scenery and the different Australia makes up for the plot. The atmosphere is very dark and gloomy making it the best one-of-a-kind atmosphere for this film. The film was made with very little money and George Miller, the director of Mad Max Trilogy, actually had to work as an Emergency Room Doctor. The stunts look very cool, not stylish, and with the amount of money it was made with, you have to marvel and wonder on how on earth could they have made it? The film's first half is slow and the dialog is pretty lame to the bone. I didn't like the first half because it had no adrenaline like it did for the second half. The first chasing scene had to be the worst of the film and everyone shouting ""Night Rider!"" really made it look lame. The story paces up in the second half and makes you forget about the crap you had to endure for the first half. As I finished the film, Mad Max impacted me and my brain was telling me to give this film a perfect ten but after remembering about the first half, I finally decided to give it a six. One thing that I don't think was necessary was the classification for the film in Australia. It got an R18+ up here and in the United States it was the same thing. This film has less violence that Running Scared and that was rated MA15+.In a dystopic future Australia, a vicious violent biker gang murder nicknamed the Nightrider, a cop's family and make his fight with them personal. He escapes from police custody by killing an officer and stealing his vehicle. Max pursues the Nightrider in a high-speed chase, which results in the Nightrider's death by fiery explosion. Following the dangerous chase, which resulted in injuries for a number of officers, the police chief warns Max who thinks nothing of it at the time that now the bandits are out for him because of the death of the Nightrider. The biker gang, which is led by the Toecutter plans to avenge Nightrider's death by killing MFP officers. Toecutter's young protegé, the biker Johnny the Boy, sets a trap for Max's close friend and fellow officer, Jim Goose. When Goose's vehicle is flipped over, the bikers burn him alive in retaliation for the Nightrider's death.The action scenes are truly remarkable for the way it is portrayed on screen. It has a touch of both reality and unreality, and with that, the action scenes are more enjoyable. The Aussie accent is still there and more annoying than ever but the film's fun-ness will make you forget about that. The film was before I got it an unknown to me and I shunned it because it looked so boring but I urge you guys out there to forget about that and watch the film. I lowly recommend this to any Aussie and someone who loves watching their typical revenge film. My two favorite scenes had to be when: 1 - When Max's wife is running through the woods with the bikers' after her because that scene had a sense of horror and thriller stuck to it making it memorable. 2 - Max's reaction to his wife and daughters death because that part of the film made you hate the bikies as much as Max and for the way it was presented on screen.",Mad Max
176,butchfilms,"What a Great Movie, Mad Max is the man of the highway",9,3 January 2009,"I have always liked road movies, but this one is just great since the first until the last moment, it must have one of the best beginning action sequences of movie history. I think ""Mad Max"" deserves 8.5 stars and not its current 6.9 stars which I find very low, it must have at least 7.5.I like everything about it, the interesting plot, the characters, the strong meaning of revenge, the beautiful shots of the highway and the great chase and crash scenes.The plot is developed in a near future about a police officer called Max (an excellent car driver)who watches the highway from delinquents until one day he and his policemen friends have to face a group of motorcycle criminals who are looking for revenge for the death of one of their gang friends, which is going to bring terrible consequences for both sides.I recommend watching it to anyone who likes action movies with a good story and interesting characters.",Mad Max

The final 20 minutes of the film shows a notable increase in quality, and perhaps this darker tone would've served the film well if it had featured earlier and for longer. It has its fanbase, but if this film was made today a sequel would never have seen the light of day...",Mad Max
178,joshuafagan-64214,A Deserved Classic,9,23 October 2015,"Fun fact: from '80 to '99, this movie was the most profitable movie on record. It was made for about 500,000 Australian Dollars and made about 100,000,000 US Dollars' worth worldwide. Even watching the movie, that number seems unbelievable. It is a good movie, don't get me wrong. But it does not seem to me like the sort of movie that would draw millions to the box office. It is less a Mad Max movie and more of a proto-Mad Max movie, the kind of movie that people nowadays make to capitalize on pre-existing franchising by calling them origin movies.I suppose the violence and wildheart and grim tone of the film would be a factor; at least in those days, before PG-13 became the default rating for pretty much everything in the known universe, it could be a draw, especially when the marketplace was devoid of such. But even that seems tame in the movie. Of course, that's because I watched this film after the other two films of the original trilogy. The people who first saw this movie didn't. And I suppose if you've never seen a Mad Max movie, this movie would incite more fire in you than was in those car crashes. Everything depends on perspective.But if I sound disappointed, it is only partly because this film did not sweep up my spirit and did Road Warrior and, later, Fury Road. It is also because I'm remembering that the first time I watched this film, it cut off about fifteen minutes before the end. Now, if you know what happens in the last fifteen minutes, like I did before I even watched this film, you know how disappointing that is. While this movie is quality, it does drag a bit despite being only ninety minutes long and unlike the other movies in this trilogy, it doesn't have that post-apocalyptic landscape to keep you bust. The last fifteen minutes is where it launches into a climatic fit of adrenaline and Max starts his descent into darkness that will continue in Road Warrior.Max is, as you should know, played by a very young Mel Gibson. His distinctive voice and cool yet crazy attitude are on full display, as demonstrated in an opening sequence in which he kills the leader of a bike gang and sets up the rest of the movie. I will say that it is interesting that the man who would ostensibly be the 'big bad' is fought at the beginning of the movie and the rest is about the antics of his henchmen.It is strange. This movie does not just feel like an origin story, it feels more like one than any of the actual origin stories created. The set-up is there: when viewed through the prism of its other, superior brethren, this is pretty much a movie about how Mad Max became Mad Max; about his character arc to the dark anti-hero of the desert. As an origin story, it is spectacular because it feels authentic all the way through. The production values are low, the actor is actually young, and nothing feels forced. It is the perfect origin story. If Hollywood wants to keep making them, they should take lessons from this movie.As a stand-alone movie, it is uneven. It is grim, but not quite grim enough to captivate you. As a fan of the Mad Max series, I am glad there is a good movie about how he became who he is; it gives the other movies more weight. But this proto-apocalyptic world, while interesting, does not immerse you as much as do the sandy landscapes of the other films. The characters could have been a lot less interesting, but they are not enough to sustain the movie. This is not necessarily a bad thing; the Mad Max movies are not about tons of characterization and that works just fine for them. But it does make the film's flaws more apparent.Which is a disappointment, because when this movie works, it really works. There are moments in which you see the brilliance that defined the other movies. Innovative and sweeping cinematography. Clever editing. Just the right balance of insanity and humanity. Sharp lines when they're needed and wordless moments when it doesn't. And even when the movie meanders and drags, you're never completely taken out of the action. This is a good movie; if it wasn't, I wouldn't be giving it 4.5 out of 5 and considering giving it 5. But inside it is a great movie. I'm just glad this film was a big enough hit to bring it out.",Mad Max

180,RMurray847,OVERRATED AT BEST,5,27 May 2002,"This movie is primarily a classic, in my opinion, because it was the prequel which led to THE ROAD WARRIOR, which really is a classic.  MAD MAX was made on a low budget, yes, and some nice things were done with very little money. (Although choppy editing is inexcusable no matter how low the budget, and there's lots of nonsensical editing in this flick.) THe opening sequences of the film, in which the various police chase Nightrider, is fairly effective and sets one up for ever increasing excitement.  However, the movie heads pretty much downhill from there in terms of excitement.The events that make Max ""Mad"" happen so late in the film, and then his revenge is so abruptly carried out that it is about as anti-climactic as anything can be.  Toecutter, whom we've grown to despise, should face a clever, hard-fought death at the hands of Max, instead of the abrupt end that comes to him almost without Max's help.Mel Gibson is okay in the movie, but has little to do.  THe actor playing Goose is the most fun, certainly.  I only recommend the movie to those who feel they MUST have the backstory to The Road Warrior, but frankly, the future envisioned in MAD MAX is very different from the truly post-apocalyptic world of the ROAD WARRIOR.",Mad Max

182,CherryBlossomBoy,Thank God it was a shoe-string budget!,10,19 May 2015,"There appears to be a significant number of fans of ""Mad Max"" franchise who just don't happen to like ""Mad Max"", the original film. And after watching the fourth installment the other day, I'm beginning to suspect that George Miller, the director, may be one of them himself!All three latter films were done on a big budget and all share the same post-apocalyptic setting with one and only premise - crazy action. We're talking about the world of freaks in freaky costumes, lots of high-octane car chases and lots and lots of violence. Big budget seemed to ensure Miller and co. can squeeze in everything they can possibly think of - in terms of attractive fights, stunts and explosions - but at the expense of coherent plot, developing characters that are not cartoon caricatures... and Max himself. Already in 1981 in the second installment, ""the Road Warrior"", Max was lightly swept aside as the main character to give way to big chases and extravagant villains. By 2015 he all but disappeared, while a female lead carried the film through.But before that, before the ""franchise"" crossed the border into grotesque charade, ""Mad Max"" was truly a film with meaning. It was set in near, pre-apocalyptic future (famously ""Few years from now..."") and, true to the 70's, offered a grim visage of decline of societal order as we know it. Police force is a ragtag bunch, only slightly better than marauding hordes they confront daily. Much like Harry Callahan in ""Dirty Harry"", Max Rockatansky is haunted by the question - how different he really is from villains he pursues? Like Callahan he is pushed into discovering the answer by set of horrific circumstances. After a bunch of really spooky psychopaths kills people he holds dearest, he sets on a revenge that will put him on the other side of the law. Although this outline may, and does, sound like a cliché, it is filled with poignant scenes, clever dialog and colorful, yet believable, characters which make it feel really real. The proceedings and the resolution are brutal and merciless in a way that isn't commonly seen in an A-film. The whole experience is gripping, and even if there weren't car chases in it, it would at least make for a quite suspenseful horror. Combination of the horror and the brilliantly executed chases, however, are what made ""Mad Max"" revolutionary, influential and, in my eyes, unforgettable. True classic on all counts, and I don't use that word lightly.Now it turns out its depths and achievement may have been the result of an accident - the fact that the budget was too tiny for a pure action spectacle! But it's all the better for that! George Miller may have gone on to things that are more suitable for his flamboyancy, but what he has done here, with help of co-writer James McCausland and producer Byron Kennedy, is a true testament to his guts and vision as a writer and as a director.",Mad Max

Occasional romantic moments crossed by unsuspected savagery and spiced with mega-weird behavior of this loony festival create an atmosphere that cannot quite fit in an ordinary mind. Trying to remember the plot I am still struggling to understand what happened to the George Miller's world so that it became such a junk yard and why is it a dystopia. On the contrary, second part jumps out like jack in the box smashing you with a suspense and thrill to the level that you all shake and thoughts flicker in your mind like light stands on the full speed.The cast is very picturesque, however, not that memorable. The only name that comes back is Mel Gibson and the reason is that I've already watched tons of movies with him.In the end I may summon the rain of rotten fruits upon myself but the value of the first Mad Max is no more than a chewing gum that taste of which wears out in 5 minutes, despite some momentary mint explosions.",Mad Max

Sometimes the film seems to meander aimlessly, some of the plot issues are silly or cliched, but the film still holds up after 20 some odd years.I love post-apocalyptic films and am surprisingly lenient in my judgment of them, because I find them so cool (hell, I even saw Steel Dawn... didn't like it, but I saw it).  However, I don't really need to be lenient about Mad Max, because Gibson's presence alone makes this film well worth watching and enjoying over and over again.  It is crudely filmed and vastly overshadowed by its much more visionary sequels, but there is a certain rawness that this movie brings out that is not fully captured by either the Road Warrior or Thunderdome.

Most people seem to think that the second one is even better, but I can't agree on this because of several things:First of all, this first Max movie has got a very important question, and that is that the violence of today are going to be worse tomorrow. The film dares to view violence even more than most movies do today, and I think this is a good thing, that helps to make this film trustworthy.The acting is better in Mad Max than in the sequels, and the feeling of a near, almost broken down society with a small police force is more interesting than the post-nuclear situation that the second and third film tries to show us.The car crashes and the pursuit in the openings of Mad Max are truly incredible.

Let's talk about those first.The main issue I had with Mad Max was the choppy feel of it. Throughout the film, there are a couple different times where there would be a hardcore action car chase, and then the film would cut back to Max having a nice time with his wife. This annoyed the heck out of me. The audience would be all on the edge of their seats, watching Max take down the bad guys, and once his goal was accomplished, we'd cut back to him and his wife. It wasn't that big of a problem, but it stops the movie from being perfect. Other than this, the film was nothing but gritty, drooling action.All of the car chases are directed fantastically. Like mentioned earlier, when Max was chasing down the baddies, the viewer will get white knuckles like you wouldn't believe. Well, you will believe it, once you watch the movie. Anyways, all of the scenes of action were great, without a flaw in them. The acting was also great in these scenes. Although all of the actors did well in the more calm scenes, they really shined during the action. Their high quality performances really advanced this movie, especially Mel Gibson's.The use of practical effects and real explosions also aids this movie tremendously. With no CGI, there's no moments where the audience calls out ""fake,"" or even doubts the recent effects. This was a very smart decision on the film makers' parts, and helps the film in every way possible. Like I said earlier, the combined acting and great practical effects, there's not a problem to be found in the action scenes.The suspense is also directed well, especially in one particular scene in which Toecutter is chasing a particular character. Said character is running, and Toecutter is chasing closely behind. The audience is quickly sucked into the film at this point, and really feels as if they are running from Toecutter themselves, not just the character in the movie.All of these above things come together to make Mad Max a great film, and it really does shine amongst some other revenges stories. I'm going to give Mad Max an A, or a 9 out of 10.",Mad Max

I cant give it lower of higher than a 7 because of its time. 1979 and 1980 is a major difference. The acting was bad and most of the things that they did are weird, everyone is just weird but that is the style.

Also, the last scene of the movie was legendary for me. Saw movie came to my mind for a moment. Those who watch the saw movie understand it when it comes to the end of the movie. Finally, I did not like the opening scene of the movie.The point I criticize is this: A bad perception has been created in the movie against motorcycle users. Motorcycle users have been launched as a marauding, thief, hijacker, bummy bandit. This can cause a bias in humans against all motorcycle users.

200,super marauder,The birth of an international super star!!!,9,7 March 2002,"I saw Mad Max on a movie channel in 1981, of course it was the dubbed version. Even so, I felt a certain charisma toward this ""no-name"" actor by the name of Mel Gibson. I could tell this man had tremendous talent, and charm. In fact, I thought that Max was so cool that I died my hair black, strutted around in a black leather jacket, and wanted to paint my car black and put a blower through the hood! (Although today looking back, that would have been really disgusting on an AMC Gremlin!). This not only shows how impressionable I was at nineteen years old , but that low budget movies aren't always bad. From then on, if a movie has Mel Gibson in it, I have to see it! When the move starts out with the phrase ""A few years from now"", and goes right into a chase scene that rivals 'Bullitt', George Miller teases us with glimpses of the star, until the chase ends in a blaze of twisted metal. Great directing George! I won't outline the plot, because I can't say anymore that's already been said, but the movie has one of the coolest cars, and one of the greatest actors of all time! George Miller's vision of the future was less then optimistic, and seemed more realistic than, say....... Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future at that time, scary thought! What's interesting, is the movie made no reference to a post World War III society, (I took is as the world economy collapsed), but people assumed this was taking place after the war was over.
 There is some talk of a Mad Max 4, with Mel doing a cameo, but if that's true, I hope they do a re-think, and have Mel as the star! I'll see it anyway! I understand the Mad Max movies don't appeal to everybody, but if you want to see the birth of a super star, get the original undubbed Australian version on DVD. I did, and it was money well spent!",Mad Max

202,charlieoso,"""I am the Nightrider. I'm a fuel injected suicide machine. I am a rocker, I am a roller, I am an out-of-controller!""",8,30 July 2019,"Back in 1979 George Miller released his very first the film and it is both extremely impressive and innovative for someone's first movie. Like both Ridley Scott (both ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER) and John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN) this film along with its original sequels was shall we say inspired many other films, but none of them were as good as what Miller brought us.In the near future the roads are being fought over by law enforcement and vicious gangs. American Mel Gibson plays the title character Max Rockatansky who works with law enforcement to try and wipe the nasty hooligans off the road. I do believe there is a wonderful opening to the film that introduces really most of the cops and of course Max. But, the opening brings us some humour, but most of all is most incredible stunt work (that is a staple and must for all MAD MAX films). Also within the intro we are introduced to Nightrider (Vincent Gil, no not David Hasselhoff wrong Knight Rider) who Max must come up against blasting down the road. Nightrider dies, but the gang he was involved in step up and look for revenge. They are led by the ultra-crazy Toe-Cutter (great memorable performance by Hugh Keays-Byrne). I really do think that Miller really did a great job in bringing some villains to the screen here (like he did in every MAD MAX film). They are all individuals, but are also all swallowed up in madness and not very nice people at all. I hate to give major plot points away during a review, but after Max's best bud and partner Goose (Steve Bisley) is killed by Toe-Cutter, Max retires. But, that does not slow Toe-Cutter and his vile gang down one bit.Brian May (not the guitarist from Queen) does a very good job with the music and I feel it really highlights a lot of the action or what is taking place on screen. He went on to do the first sequel THE ROAD WARRIOR as well.Written by James McCausland and George Miller based on a story by Miller and Byron Kennedy.",Mad Max

204,citizenchris,Looking back on Max,8,10 July 2005,"Let me preface this statement by saying first that is has been years sense i have viewed any of the MM films. The film i sorta grew up on was pt2 and 3 I hadn't seen the first film until i was a teenager (prolly 16 or 17). Its weird seeing a film like mad max after viewing its much ""larger"" sequels. I liken it to seeing Alien or the original Texas Chainsaw Masacre after viewing its sequel or remake subsequently. When viewing these films this way its easy to dismiss the originals as too small. One has to take into account first that there wouldn't have been the sequels/remakes had it not been for some of the things that made the originals great.I recently purchased the s.e. of Mad Max and viewed it w/the eyes of a 25yr old who is much more appreciative of what makes for good fun cinema (in my humble opinion). I now have a much greater appreciation for the original MM. Its a great film in its genre. That is to say post modern western. Like so many fun flicks its a b picture trying to be more. George Miller is smart enough to give the film depth w/the intimate scenes w/Max and his lady. So that when she is killed you feel what max is feeling. This is what makes the film more than just a fetishistic car/bike movie. But it is that ladies and gentlemen. This is a car guys movie. Both my GF's father and Uncle are car guys and they love this picture for the cars. Whats wrong w/that I ask, not a damn thing.Another thing I didn't understand as a teenager viewing the film was it didn't seem as post apocalyptic as its sequels. The time period at the beginning is said to be ""a few years from now"" or something to that effect. Basically this is the beginning of this post apocalyptic era. One of the things that I love about MM is that is there is no silly explanation as to why things are this way as there are in so many other films. The viewer is dropped head first into this dystopia Australian outback world of dilapidated halls of justice, rag tag cops and mean gangs that rule the highways.In closing, let me say that Mad Max is a great film. It is a rare film that is only enhanced by its sequel not out shined, or as is the case in so many ""franchise s"" remade.",Mad Max

Like all of the best exploitation films, it transcends its limitations while simultaneously embracing them. Though director George Miller took the post-apocalyptic tough guy Max a lot farther in the sequel The Road Warrior, Mad Max still packs in Miller's particular brand of black comedy thrills. Cult low budgeter that benefits from Miller's direction and Gibson's then lack of self-importance.Miller believed that audiences would find his violent story to be more believable if set in a bleak, dystopia future. Screenplay writer James McCausland drew heavily from his observations of the 1973 oil crisis' effects on Australian motorists:Yet there were further signs of the desperate measures individuals would take to ensure mobility. A couple of oil strikes that hit many pumps revealed the ferocity with which Australians would defend their right to fill a tank. Long queues formed at the stations with petrol and anyone who tried to sneak ahead in the queue met raw violence. ... George and I wrote the Mad Max script based on the thesis that people would do almost anything to keep vehicles moving and the assumption that nations would not consider the huge costs of providing infrastructure for alternative energy until it was too late.

I watched the DVD widescreen version without the voice dubbing and it looked excellent. The storyline is clear, simple, and concise. Mad Max has great camera work, great directing, authentic looking stunts, and decent acting. The suspenseful scenes are done very well - especially Max's wife running in panic through the woods. However, the plot is nothing unique. A motorcycle gang terrorizes the streets of rural Australia. The gang eventually target Max's wife and kid. Mad Max had enough and enacts revenge.And ending is a bit disappointing and simplistic - that's the major downside to the film. It's also too bad we didn't get to see Max's wife again after getting hit by the gang (she couldn't continue performing because she suffered in a motorcycle accident). Despite some shortcomings, it's an entertaining movie worth watching.Rating: 7.5 of 10 FYI - Mel Gibson was initially paid just $5000 in this film",Mad Max

210,DaRick89,Mad Max is a quality low-budget action film which keeps you hooked most of the time,8,12 April 2006,"Mad Max has had something of a stigma attached to it over the years. Most people perceive it as some sort of ultra-violent film set in a wasteland. It is set in a wasteland: post-Apocalyptic Australia. It is something of a cult hit and helped to launch Mel Gibson's career. The perception I mentioned above is not completely correct: it is not graphically violent so to speak; most of the violence is either hinted (such as the road sign at the beginning involving 57 deaths or something like that) or off-screen. The background music is very effective however and helps add suspense and an air of eeriness to the film itself. It is decidedly low-budget; no special effects, just crashes and explosions, but I am not averse to this, so lets move on.The plot is pretty simple, although it does not have any real plot holes to pick at. It revolves around a cop, Mad Max Rockatansky and the murder of his wife and young child by a group of sadistic biker thugs. There. That's it. Add a few crashes, explosions, motorbikes and cars to that and you basically have Mad Max. It is a bit hard to follow at times; it took me a while to figure out who died and why the Toecutter was wreaking vengeance. I am not particularly bothered by the Australian accents, as I am one myself.What Mad Max does well is get your attention with a haunting introductory sequence. We flick to a scene where this guy in a black car is being chased by cops. 5 minutes into the film. I thought: ""This is gonna be a mad film!"" I was, for the most part, correct, although Mad Max does have drawbacks.Mel Gibson looks pretty good in what must be his first major movie role, but the same cannot be said for some of the others. Joanne Samuel has little chemistry with Max, save for a few brief moments. The villain is both weak and hammy - that's why it took me a little while to figure out he was evil and then only because he was part of a biker gang. Without the haunting background music, he would not be even the slightest bit scary, or even creepy.All up, this is a quality film which does its best with what it has; which is to say, not a lot. George Miller has managed to turn what could have been a stupid camp film into a memorable cult film. See it.4/5 stars",Mad Max

And first of all - like the sequels - it's a warning. Max and his fate - we see all that, but at the background it's the fate of the world, turned into a desert by out own weapons, by mankind's pride, covetousness,self-confidence... By our own madness!

213,JamesMovieGuy_117,When the gangs take over the highway... remember he's on your side,8,13 October 2018,"Mad Max is an iconic landmark in Australian cinema. Its tale of fuel injected revenge resonated with Australian audiences and became the most successful film at the box office at the time in that country. Although, does it hold up? If you compare it to the sequels and other more recent films you'll be underwhelmed. Although if you understand the context on why the film was made, the limitations of the filmmakers and the sheer dedication of the crew (particularly the daring stunt people) you'll be impressed. Also if you're an aspiring filmmaker like me, this is a good film to come back to for inspiration.The story takes place in the not too distant future where a highway gang led by the Toecutter terrorises innocent people. Max Rockatansky is a Main Force Patrol officer, who along with his fellow officers, attempt to bring Toecutter's gang down, but the influence of law and order is corrupting around them. Max then loses everything held dear to him, pushing him over the edge and leading him to enact a personal vendetta on the gang members responsible for his loss.Mad Max was the brainchild of George Miller and he continued to direct the sequels. He had first hand experience in the emergency room witnessing the horrific injuries caused by road incidents. This sparked the concept of Mad Max and its dystopian world directly reflects the context of road safety in Australia and like many dystopian films questions where we are heading as a society.Mad Max was made on an estimated $350,000, with most of the crew being paid in beer for their efforts. The opening pursuit of the Nightrider is one of the most impressive sequences, George Miller sacrificed his van to be wrecked for one of the shots, they used real rockets to attach to Nightriders car before it explodes and stunt men got severely injured afterwards. For a low budget film, Byron Kennedy and George Miller took tremendous risks to make it as engaging and entertaining as possible. It was also all edited in George Miller's kitchen... for a film that was edited in a kitchen I can forgive some of the awkward pacing and edits scattered throughout.The cast is also fantastic, Mel Gibson for one of his first roles is great as the title character and demonstrates his talent from so early on his career. The gang members are all very memorable with each having their little quirks and you end up despising every single one of them by the end of the film.Mad Max is an impressive first entry that started a cultural phenomenon.

214,uroshnor54,A Good Movie with Kind of Bad Pacing,8,7 July 2014,"Mad Max is pretty fun movie. I liked it overall. This is one story of vigilante justice where I wanted the main character to succeed. I remember watching V for Vendetta and hating it because I strongly disliked the main character. I'd never been so happy to see the hero of a movie die than when I saw V for Vendetta. But Max Rockatansky is likable. I'll admit I was a bit surprised and kind of disappointed when the credits started to roll. I knew the movie was going to be short (the case said 94 minutes) but it didn't feel quite right. Then I realized the problem wasn't that the movie was too short but that the pacing was kind of bad. Before I watched the movie, I read that it was about a guy whose best friend and family are killed by a motorcycle gang, leading him to take revenge. The revenge portion of the movie is much too short. Jim ""Goose"" Rains, Max's friend, and Jessie and Sprogg, his wife and son, respectively, should have been killed in the first third or half of the movie, leaving the rest for his revenge. Also, I didn't get why Jessie doesn't tell Max about the motorcycle gang members after her first encounter with them. I can see why she didn't tell him about them immediately (she was in a hurry to get away from them and didn't have time to explain to Max) but she should have told him later. And why, after all that, did she go to the beach alone? So there are a few problems with Mad Max, but I thought it was worth watching.",Mad Max

217,aakash-karkare,Mad Max,7,27 November 2010,The first part in the trilogy was a pretty decent movie. Since it had a low budget and everyone was doing it for the first time I guess it was a little uneven in parts and that could have been better with tighter editing and more efficient directing.I saw the dubbed version and I do not recommend it. The voices all seem very cheesy and spoil what the movie is trying to say. I don't know why Americans have to dub English movies all over again.Having said that Mad Max is a good film in its own right. It is unafraid in what it is doing. Geroge Miller doesn't use a lot of dialogue but instead depicts a very terrible view of a post apocalyptic future. Law and order has failed in this world and humanity has regressed to its very basic form. There are a lot of very exciting car chases and some great shots of the Australian outback.Mel Gibson stars as the eponymous hero who comes back with a vengeance. He does a decent enough job but there is not much chance to showcase any acting talent.The focus of the movie is not as much as on the action but more on its characters and their problems. The fact that it was made in 1979 makes it a movie a very unafraid movie for the subject matter that it was trying to tackle. There is no safe ending and no safe scene in the movie. The family is not reunited in the end. No catharsis. The seventies were the time for such kind of movies that did not have politically correct endings . In that sense Mad Max is like Chinatown.Quentin Tarantino through the lead character in True Romance called it a real movie. He said that movies should be like this. Yes movies should definitely be like this. They should challenge you as a viewer and as a human being. And Mad Max does that. It also spawned numerous rip offs and look alikes. Mad Max gave birth to the 80's action movie.,Mad Max
218,escoles,"Best of the 'Mad Max' series, by a long shot",8,19 August 2000,"TRIVIUM: I recently learned what a ""toecutter"" is -- according to William Gibson (in _All Tomorrow's Parties_), it's a criminal who specializes in extorting other criminals, typically through physical torture. Also known as a ""standover man"".As far as I'm concerned, this is the best movie of Miller's career. The editing was superb, the score incredible, and the two worked together in ways that even high-budget movies seldom achieve. John Woo and Quentin Tarantino chauvinists could get their eyes opened a little to the possibilities of traditional sound and editing by studying this film.All the film-school nonsense aside, the story is powerful: The evolution of Max the family man, who does an unpleasant duty without malice or joy, into ""Mad"" Max the 'road warrior', who roams the highways like a wraith seeking revenge for his murdered wife and son (so hauntingly evoked by the recurrance of his wife's saxophone theme in the score). It gives you a chance to see a good pre-star performance from Gibson, and some excellent supporting work by Joanna Samuels and Hugh Keyes-Byrne (""the Toecutter"").I give it only an 8 because it's as close as can be to impossible to find copies with the original actors' voices on it.

219,connorbbalboa,"Admirable movie, but undeniably has flaws",9,27 December 2015,"For the record, I watched The Road Warrior first in high school, and Fury Road in theaters with a friend before watching this film. I did not know what to think of it just yet, and now, just having watched it, I still don't know entirely what to think. I admire it greatly, as it brought back the cynicism and grimness of a lot of the film output from the first half of the 1970s, just as the blockbuster age was starting, as Star Wars had only come out a couple years before and Superman the previous year, but it is not as well filmed as its successor. As an action film, it does drag somewhat, mainly in the beginning, unlike in The Road Warrior where the films starts by giving the exposition on the end of civilization and the death of Max's family from this film first, then opening with Max being chased by road thugs, but the first car chase in Mad Max does go a bit slowly. Also, my other main problem is that I felt no satisfaction in the main villain, Toecutter's death. I think that audiences want to be satisfied when the hero defeats, or even just upright kills the villain, but Toecutter's death was not as satisfying as it could have been, as he just runs into an rig and his bike is torn apart. Johnny the Boy gets the worse death, being caught in an explosion and given the possibility to saw off his own ankle to get away, and I feel the situations should have been reversed for both Toecutter and Johnny the Boy. Also, a couple of the characters make unintelligent decisions in my eyes. Even though the film has these problems, Mad Max still feels like a grim and independently-filmed art house action film, and the film does work in that regard, as it has very good car chases, and one does feel sorry when Max's family and Goose are killed, showing how unfair and revealing the future world is.",Mad Max

The opening scenes of the movie were edge-of-your-seat action, but as it went, the movie almost transformed into a drama of sorts. Characterwise, I really enjoyed Fif. The writing was hit or miss, but still solid, and it served as buildup for the final payoff. I liked the ending, and it was shot and paced very well, although it could have been a bit more climactic. This movie was hit and miss overall, but when it hit, it was really fun and engaging.",Mad Max

Still, it falls out of mainstream and not only because of tiny budget, but because it focuses on both character development and criticising self-destructing way of modern society, which makes it race to it's grave as fast as the V8. George Miller took a pretty much standart action movie plot and transformed it into modern classics, a movie which can compete with such masterpieces of directing as Apocalypse Now, Aliens, Dead of Alive or Brother. The filming of Australian desert combined with great cars creates an extraordinare atmosphere and sense of touching the eternity. Actors also did an excellent job, especially Hugh Keays-Byrne and Geoff Parry. 10/10.",Mad Max

224,KnightLander,MAD MAX - The film that made Mel Gibson,7,20 June 2005,"Many people think that Mel Gibson is the man that made ""Mad Max"". In fact, it is the contrary: ""Mad Max"" made Mel Gibson. Without the 1979 Aussie hit, the world would never have heard of Mel Gibson. And that would be a bad thing.""Mad Max"" is set on the Australian highways, which, in the not-so-far future, is the primary mode of transportation. The highways are ruled by vicious biker gangs that will stop at nothing to get a thrill. This time, however, they picked the wrong guy: Max Rockatansky (Gibson). First they take out his best friend. Next up, they pursue his wife and child, eventually ending up in the death of his family. This is when Max gets mad. You just made ""Mad"" Max's fight with you personal, biker gang. Bad move.""Mad Max"" is a cult classic, but no one really knows how important it is. It was nominated for eight awards (including Best Film) at the Australian Film Institute awards and won three. It, naturally, introduced Mel Gibson to the world. And it has the highest cost-to-profit ratio of any film ever made.George Miller's directing is good, and teamed with composer Brian May (NOT of Queen), he creates a film that feels very much like a ""Flash Gordon"" epic. Gibson is terrific, and the cast performs pretty well for a film like this. When I say ""like this"", I mean a low-budget film - and I mean low budget. Occasionally, the budget does show - but hey, that's part of the fun of it! One of the greatest parts of the film is the car chases. ""Mad Max""'s car chase sequences have been rivaled by none and surpassed only by its first sequel, ""The Road Warrior"". The chases are intense, high-powered, and extremely realistic.""Mad Max"" is a landmark in Australian cinema, and very important to sci-fi cinema as well as cinema in general. It is the rare type of film that isn't afraid to be unique. ""Mad Max"" is history.",Mad Max
225,Dr.Mike,Australian Dirty Harry,7,15 January 2000,"Mad Max is notable as the first Australian movie to break out and become a worldwide hit.  It also is a fairly straight-forward revenge movie that bemoans all the excess violence in the world.  Like many movies that feel there is too much violence in our amoral, hero-less world, it answers the problem of violence with more violence.  It also has some particularly nasty revenge aspects.  We do not need a hero.  Still, as an early Australian film, as a George Miller film, and as a star vehicle for an unbelievably hot Mel Gibson, Mad Max works very well.  The stunts are good, the photography is well above average, and the dream-like future it creates causes the viewer to question the reality of what we are seeing.  Is it cops like Max that create those violent criminals?  Is it regular people afraid to stand against the violence?  Or is it just an inevitable force of nature? Whatever the answer, the film is worth a look.  I saw the dubbed version and believe that the original would be superior.",Mad Max
226,WOZ inOZ,Still smart,9,7 June 2000,"The Australian cult hit and financial record breaker from 1979 still holds a fascination with it's young and young at heart audience. A fresh faced George Miller put together an astounding package with local talent, little money and heaps of energy with clearly visible panache. The plot is a simple tale of tragedy and revenge set 'a few days from now.' The near future timeline and Australia's slightly unfamiliar surroundings make 'Mad Max' appear almost like a violent comic book brought to life.Mel Gibson produces a memorable role in the film that would launch him toward super stardom, providing a certain amount of credability among the intense action scenes and the almost spaghetti western style proceedings (which become even more evident with some versions that are dubbed with transatlantic voices) This is a film of good guys and bad guys, love, loss and vengeance, with cops in persuing V8 Ford Falcons and bikers on Kawasaki's replacing the western's Gunslingers on steeds. Very rarely does Miller's direction fail to engross the viewer, complimenting a catchy, well paced script filled with some quite memorable lines that could be considered at times cheesy, but fit the mood perfectly. Steve Bisley has his fare share, playing the live-wired but doomed Jim Goose who provides some of the more light-hearted moments earlier in the film. Playing the villains we have Hugh Keays Byrne on top form as the charismatic Toe Cutter who becomes almost a mystically evil character teaching Tim Burns as 'Johnny the Boy' his disturbed apprentice. Thumbs up should also go to Vince Gil as the 'Night Rider' a key character in one of the best scene setters of any action film, bar none. The entire sequence is crafted expertly, building from a quiet balmy day to a police car chase that becomes rapidly more dangerous as the miles fly by.  Speed is conveyed masterfully by Miller, with impeccable editing from Cliff Hayes and Tony Paterson, presenting Grant Page's ballsy and damn well dangerous stunt sequences with maximum impact, ranking it as one of the finest car chases in celluloid history. It is easy to see how some other critics point out the film even suffers after this sequence, with the rest of the film unable to match the hi-octane opening. However the film does hold well throughout. With only a slowing of pace during the middle act, the film continues to build upon it's characters before the tragic events unfold, driving to it's unescapeable conclusion.As well as keeping action fans entertained, 'Mad Max' is also a petrol-head's dream. The Australian car customising scene is clearly evident, adding an original look and feel to the film, which manages to still hold up well today. And though Max Max is not a road movie almost all the film is situated on or near the black liquorice tarmac of the road and the beasts that prowl on it.Cult films historically have a hard-core underground following, of which George Miller's film has plenty, but unlike so many other cult films, Mad Max has been recognised by a wider audience with over $100 million box office takings to prove it, a success of which is deservedly so.",Mad Max

228,larrymeers,Okay but overrated,6,20 August 2016,"So once i saw Mad Max:Fury Road(which was very good), i wanted to the the original to get a better understanding of it, and it wasn't what i expected. First the pros. So i really like how George Miller was able to work with a very low budget and yet have all of those car chases. Speaking of car chases, the begging sequence was good, you got the cops chasing a psychotic driver, that was a pretty good sequence. Mel Gibson's character was alright, but i just wish he did more. But now for the cons. If i am correct this movie is supposed to take place in the apocalypse right? Well the sets don't make it out like that. The town that Max lives in just looks like a regular town. My friend told me this was a great revenge story, but you don't get to see his revenge until his wife and son die at the very end of the film. I think it would've been better if they carried his revenge story threw out the movie. So over all i thought this movie was alright, i just think its highly overrated. I don't know maybe i am just being a grandpa but i just thought this movie was alright, nothing really special about it.",Mad Max
229,pablo2896,A Pioneer,8,3 June 2015,"Mad Max Review""I am a fuel injected suicide machine! I am the rocker, I am the roller, I am out of controller!"" That crazy monologue (courtesy of the Nightrider) may be the best way of summarizing the action sequences in Mad Max. So, set in a post-apocalyptic version of the lands ""down unda"", Mad Max tells the tragic but extravagant story of a man trying to give the world a last chance by serving a collapsing law system that is overshadowed by the insanity and violence that now rules over the land.As you may have guessed, the word dystopia is a synonym for Australia in this movie and the filmmakers do an amazing job of portraying this with an extremely low budget. They use an excellent idea of only having very few city sets. The hall of justice, the hospital and some apartments and garages are seen throughout the movie but they are very scarce and empty looking. This gives the audience a true feeling of emptiness and insight on the situation that most of society has gone missing. The rest of the film is smartly shot on location. The desolated and flat landscapes of Australia serve as the perfect places to let out all the road rage in ever lasting car chases that could go on and on for days, as the roads seem to always lead to more nothingness. This wasteland is characterized very well with numerous bike gangs roaming it constantly and you can also feel the desperation of the cops who find it extremely difficult to deal with a certain gang lead by someone named ""Toecutter"". Hissssssss. But there is one man that stands strong like a rock against a current. A man who has taken the law into his own hands. Mad Mel. Sorry, Mad Max. That name carries the title of badass like no other. He gets along with his mates, he has a smoking hot wife and a cute kid, he believes in the law and he sports a roaring V8 that can catch on to almost any baddie. He is basically a symbol for the stable world, but we'll talk about all of those crazy theories later.For now let's talk about innovation. The ground base this movie establishes is vast. The ""post-apunkalypse"" that we have witnessed in many movies and parodies through the last 4 decades has its source in Mad Max. The costume design and the whole tone of the original make it somewhat of a pioneer.But aside from the style he helped to establish, George Miller surprised his audience (which at the time was fairly small) with a heavy dose of maniacal stunts that had people wandering how in the actual hell had the director convinced the stunt-men to pull off those cringing vehicular tricks! The action in this flick is astounding and the lack of a big budget solidifies the fact that you are a visionary director with a remarkable ability to plan and direct action sequences (just watch Mad Max: Fury Road and you'll know what I am talking about). Risk clearly lies behind every shot but that is the only way that passion transcends into the big screen. The editing makes the action even more extravagant by mashing these scenes with perfect pace and adding subtle touches like those weird ""eyes popping out"" moments. Those subtle moments of insanity are what make this movie so unique. The antagonist hissing at Max is a weird ""wut did I just watch"" instance but that sort of weirdness is what keeps us from shutting our eyes in these sort of films. Aside from all the praise lie a couple of negatives that are understandable because this was George Miller's first feature lenght film. One of them being that Max becomes ""Mad"" as the movie is reaching its end. And I don't mean the third act; the real ""Mad Max"" gets maximally 15 minutes of screen time. Even the normal Max gets only half of the movie worth of screen time, as the first half mainly tells the story of Goose, Max's friend. Mel Gibson only gets to shine as an actor in a very limited amount of screen time. The rest of the movie he is just staring at nothing like a badass and that is to little for our main man Mel! The pacing is all over the place switching, very confusingly, between some vehicle crashing into a million peaces and a scene of Max's wife getting a long walk along the beach and an even longer tan. As distracting as they might seem, the negatives don't outweigh the positives. George Miller creates a world where sanity and insanity have come to a final confrontation. A world where you can only survive if you adapt to the circumstances and become as crazy as its inhabitants.""Mad Max"" is the product of this world. The product of ""Toecutter"". Stripped from all hope and love, a new Max emerges and adapts to the world as it is. That's why ""Toecutter"" is such an iconic character and worthy of an introduction as awesome as the one he gets, he represents madness and the birth of ""Mad Max"". But we will not thank ""Toecutter"" for molding such an iconic film persona, as he now lies in the category of roadkill. We will, however, thank George Miller for starting out on such a successful franchise with very low resources but immense passion. This film is a must see for someone looking for the work of a mastermind behind action sequences and scene building mixed in with some maniacal ideas of characters and even some laughs that will come out of its 80's movie cheesiness. And it even made Mel Gibson reveal himself to the world! But before I lose myself talking about Mel Gibson's career, I will finish this review by giving Mad Max an 8 out of 10.",Mad Max
230,bitomurder,Don't make Max mad,7,11 April 2018,"Mad Max, is really a gearhead movie: sweet cars, sweet bikes, lots of chases. It was made on a small budget and surely shows it.

Start of Mel Gibson's career and just overall awesome sequels. For it being low budget, I love good B movies, it turned out the best it could be.Starts off slow and sure the ending wasn't all that since you may have wanted something else. But I say the title, Mad Max, was just that. It was Max becoming mad. And with the effects they pulled off, with the budget you got to give them credit. It was well done, it makes you excited for the sequel(which I believe Road Warrior is the best.) Overall I give it an average score of 7, it kept me entertained. Gave you the cheesy goodness of a low budget film but was still intense. I recommend not seeing it when you're tired or you could fall asleep.George Miller told a beautiful story. Didn't overdo anything, made it seem real. All in all, cheesy dialog, action, and romance. And that is what's lovable. On a relaxing day, go enjoy this movie.

234,shaneo632,"Fantastically gritty, brutal cult classic... (MILD spoilers)",8,27 November 2007,"Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):Mad Max wastes no time in establishing a post-apocalyptic, nihilistic world, a barren wasteland where the morally bankrupt stalk the streets, preying on the innocent and defying the rather tenuous legal system. The opening scenes involve the police chasing a cop killer, yet the line between the law and the unlawful is blurred - the police wear black leather clothing, and as victims of their society, are often violent and blood-thirsty themselves.When one goes back to watch the film now, the car chases not only hold up to today's standards, but furthermore, they are refreshingly physical, organic set pieces, sending metal flying in all directions rather than littering the street with over-the-top explosions. They are shot with a kinetic energy that is impressive considering the low budget, and many filmmakers today could learn a lesson or two from watching this film.It's not long before we meet our titular hero - Max - an officer of the law, who is something of a vigilante, yet in a world such as this, his (and his colleagues') extreme methods are the only tangible form of justice. Outside of this world, Max is a family man, with a wife and a young son, and we get the impression that Max isn't some sort of sadist that enjoys killing law-breakers, but that when pitted against people who are this vicious and morally apathetic, his violent method is the only method.Whilst there is certainly no peaceful utopia in this post-nuclear world, what resembles a time of peace is usurped as a band of villainous bikers arrive in town. These bikers are quite the distinguished looking antagonists, dressed in some rather questionable-looking attire, and donning some equally curious haircuts. Whether you like their style or not, it's undeniable that the villains are visually arresting and rather original-looking. Furthermore, they are absolutely abhorrent - they have no outlet for redemption whatsoever, brutalising the town shortly after arriving.As an action hero, Max is considerably more complex than you may expect - he is an emotionally developed character, his dreams haunted by the vile mutilation of one of his colleagues. This scares Max, and provides him with a little humanity, allowing him to realise the danger of both his job, and the world around him. Not only is he scared of the evils that he encounters every day, but he is also afraid of what he is turning into - by removing savages from the streets, he is forced to, at least in part, become one himself, and worse still, he worries that he is starting to enjoy it.Needless to say, his worry overpowers him and he confines to leaving his job for the sake of his family. Ditching his chrome leather for some smart-casual attire, the viewer must beg the question - is this the ""real"" Max? Naturally, Max is now a repressed shell, but ultimately happier (and certainly safer), as he is able to enjoy his family, and he sees this sacrifice as necessary for his family.However, it isn't too long before Max's family are preyed upon by the foul bikers terrorising the town, and whilst initially able to elude them, they return with guns, and all other manner of crude weaponry, blazing. This see-saw action is a masterful reflection of Todorov's theory of equilibrium and disequilibrium, repeatedly crunching this equation, giving us moments of terror followed by moments of respite.Max and his family suffer a home invasion, a tense standoff in which Max attempts to diffuse the situation, but when you're battling foes that are this morally devoid, such attempts are largely fruitless. After the attack is over, and Max is left in the wake of an extremely tragic series of events, Gibson brings such a raw, gritty emotion to his character, quickly ploughing through a range of emotions, from simmering anger to ultimately unbridled, vengeance-driven rage. Max is past caring for his own safety - there's no sidekick or ancillary character to tell us this, but Gibson, by his speechless demeanour, lets us know it.Donning his old leather, and now truly the vigilante he near enough was whilst a cop, Max pursues full-speed ahead - Max is vengeance at 100mph, viciously stalking and slaughtering those who have wronged him. In this land where criminals walk free, Max and his special brand of justice are King. There is also a sense of irony in the fact that his job did indeed turn him into a savage, but by the film's end, Max will need that savagery to stay alive.Mad Max's ending, whilst leaving little for the viewer to ponder, is wonderfully macabre and unforgettable. The film's climax is as short and sweet as the entire film itself, wrapping things up with extreme pace, but given the nature of the film, little explanation is required once the final body hits the floor. In summary, Mad Max is an effective, impressive science-fiction actioner, all the more so considering the miniscule budget the crew had to work with. Gibson, whilst at this stage largely unknown and inexperienced, turned in an appropriately brutal and driven performance as the tortured protagonist, and if the term ""cult classic"" was ever apt anywhere, it would be here.",Mad Max
235,disastrousdallas,A great film that started a genre,10,20 January 2017,"One of the main reasons people seem to like this film is because they come in and expect The Road Warrior, despite this being Maxs origin story.The film was made on a low budget of somewhere around $300,000 and in a lot of places you can't tell.I watched this film after seeing the trailers for Mad Max: Fury Road and wanted to see where the craze started, and as I mentioned above people tend to hate it because it's not the sequels.George Miller makes his directorial Debut along with his good friend Byron Kennedy who produced the film, in his acting Debut Mel Gibson steps into a Black Leather outfit and gets behind the wheel of possibly the nicest car to ever grace Cinema a 1973 Ford Falcon XB GT affectionately Dubbed ""The last of the V8 Interceptors"", although in this film the Car is intact and isn't roughed up as the later films.The cast deliver a great performance, and I would be genuinely scared if a man Like the Toe-cutter Appeared as I would be scared he'd pounce on me at any moment.* Spoilers *a lot of people say the story makes no sense, it starts out with Max having a sense of justice and taking down a criminal, obviously the criminals gang don't like this and after one of their members is arrested and subsequently released, they critically wound the man who arrested him driving Max to question himself, and by doing so they instead of taking their revenge out directly on the man who killed the criminal from the opening, they go for a more physic- logical approach and Critically wound his Wife and killing his child, before he gains revenge himself on the gang, by hunting them down and running them off the road before hand cuffing the last member who'd wounded his friend, by the ankle to a truck which is going to explode, and leave him with one of two things to cut through, Handcuffs or his ankle before driving off leaving his sanity behind.two things make the action great in this movie, 1.George Miller and Byron Kennedy weren't working for a studio and so they had full control over the film they wanted to make, minus budget of course 2. Miller had worked in a hospital getting the funding for the film and had scene many Car crash victims allowing him to see what he could put into his masterpiece.I Rate this movie 10/10 and would highly recommend watching this movie and for those who do i suggest you don't go in expecting the Road Warrior.",Mad Max

238,pywrit,Not your typical Post-Holocaust Film,10,21 October 2002,"With scads of novels and films taking on the attempt to convey the future on a post-apocalyptic earth, very few even come close to the quality of this film and the two which follow.  First is something we rarely see in these types of action films - plot development.  While it winds slowly through this, it is there, giving reason behind the madness Max experiences (note I use the word madness and not anger, for what Max experiences goes beyond anger or fury).  That leads to the second point, which is characterization. In so many post-apocalypse movies, one is never really given any reason to like or hate the hero.  Why should they, most writers look on this type of film/novel as simple action/adventure.  Not so with this one, the viewer is pulled along, drawn into the psychotic world of Max's insanity in such a way that, even when his actions take him over the edge, the viewer continues to cheer him on because they know that deep down inside is still a human being who has been put through hell.  Toecutter is violent, intelligent, and without a single shred of humanity left in him.  He is truly a monster and the understated acting gives this character a very creepy feel that gnaws on the viewer and turns his/her stomach.  Third is pacing.  While this is an action movie, it often slows down and gives the viewer a break, only to roust them again as necessary.  This rollercoaster ride is so much more effective than today's ""go as fast as you can and never let up"" style of filmmaking.  Fourth - Writing.  This is a well-developed film that gives us just enough of what the future is like to understand what is going on. Unlike so many others, this and the following two films show society's slow, ever-increasing spiral into feudalism.  It's not an immediate effect, but one caused by a lack of coordination of the leaders.  Finally, cinematography.  This movies proves by its lack of budget that a filmmaker doesn't need a huge budget and fancy FX to make a film effective.  All the director needs is a vision, and the wherewithal to see that vision through to the end.  Just watch for the eyes throughout the film and you will understand.  On a scale of 1-10, this movie receives a 9.5.",Mad Max

241,bayou_hannibal,As boring as a 95-minute action movie could possibly be,3,2 August 2012,"The Road Warrior is one of my favorite action movies of all time. The ending scene is possibly the greatest action scene ever filmed. Even though it has long periods without action, it has great fiction go along with it. I continue to be amazed that a movie so great is actually a sequel to a movie that is so terrible. Mad Max is so bad that I had to try three separate times to finish it – during my unsuccessful attempts to do so, I could only get halfway. I'm sad to say, my persistence wasn't rewarded. Mad Max doesn't get better as it goes. It's pretty bad through the end.This movie is described as ""post-apocalyptic"". Somebody should have told that to the script writer, the cameramen, and the director. There is scarcely a hint of ""apocalypse"" in this movie, and you would never know that's what it is if you weren't told. People have morning coffee in a diner. An oil refinery is shown up and running in the background. Max wife's takes their son into a small village to buy him ice cream. The scarcity and bleakness depicted in great post-apocalyptic movies like The Road Warrior isn't shown here. False advertising abounds with this movie, since it is also usually described as a revenge tale. That description is only fitting for the last 15 minutes of the movie.The only good action in this entire movie is the car chase at the very beginning. It is in that brilliant opening that you get a hint of the techniques that would make the next movie so good: great camera work, tons of speed, the loud sounds of engines, and a bunch of cars getting smashed. The rest isn't very entertaining, which is okay, I guess, because there isn't much of it. At the end, the main villain gets punked – not by Max, but by the director and the script writer. Max hardly engages anyone in this entire movie. In between the beginning and the end, there are no real showdowns between the good guys and the bad guys -- just the bad guys torturing people, burning people alive, and intimidating people.The film spends for more time on boring, sappy scenes with Max and his wife than it does with anything that advances the plot -- a plot which, by the way, essentially takes an hour off. Here's a tip if you are watching this movie for the first time – skip everything between about 10 and 70 minutes. It's nothing but 60 minutes of poorly acted, poorly-paced drama that sets up an anticlimactic revenge in the end that falls flat. Here's a better tip – skip the movie altogether.

242,yucel81x,"An objective, but positive review...",9,10 April 2002,"This film is considered a science fiction classic, and for good reason. It was one of the earliest films to show how a low-budget became a tool, not just for first-time filmmakers, but also for creating an influential vision of the future: the dystopic, post-apocalyptic future that has left civilization in ruin and depression. It was also the film that made Mel Gibson an international star, and to think he was only paid $15,000. Sure that was worth more in 1979 than it is today, but even then, to think he was paid such a small amount for such a passionate and intense performance.
From the first moments when you can barely make out Mel Gibson's face, you can already tell he has a presence above everything else on the screen. His face alone shows emotions that most actors need pages and pages of dialogue to convey. The performances of Steve Bisley as Goose, and Hugh Keays-Byrne as the sadistic Toecutter are also especially noteworthy. From the second you see the Toecutter's face, you can tell the level of evil this character is capable of, and it's no less effective, frightening, or viciously satisfying to watch him actually perform his evil acts. Bisley plays the Goose as the ham that he is, always laughing and smiling, but when things get serious he shows desperation just as well.The stunts are brilliatly executed, and again exceptional when considering the lack of a big budget. You can tell how films like ""Ronin"" and the remake of ""Gone in Sixty Seconds,"" or any film that had an elaborate car chase that followed HAD to be influenced by this film. Kudos to director George Miller for satisfying both the audience's need for some outlandish violence, while also establishing the groundwork for the way car chases would be filmed from then on. He was also brilliant in his mastery of suspense. You knew what was going to happen, but you couldn't help but sit on the edge of your seat to watch and wait for it. He handles suspense with the same subtlety as Hitchcock, showing you just enough to know what's happening, but without showing too much, which makes the effect even more horrifying. You know the bikers ran over the wife and child, but without seeing it, you were all the more horrified by it. There's also the great soundtrack from Brian May. Who would think that the guitarist from Queen could create a soundtrack that mimics the suspense of the visuals, while also echoing the despair of the Mad Max character.As for the plot...it's mundane and nothing that hadn't been done before or since, but that doesn't matter. The execution of the film, the performances of the actors, everything about the way this film was made shows that even a simple and familiar plot can be given a fresh perspective by a little ingenuity and passionate execution. ""Mad Max"" is definitely one of the best science-fiction films of all time, one of the best independent films of all time, and definitely one of the best Mel Gibson performances of all time. If you haven't seen this movie...go rent it, right now!",Mad Max
243,adriantopnik,Better than expected,8,13 April 2020,Mad Max is a classic film. A 1979 dystopia. No wonder this movie took off as it did. It truly is my second favourite mad max movie. It's better than fury road.,Mad Max
244,Challenger2013,"A Thrilling, Influential Movie",8,13 May 2015,"The best way to watch this film today is to imagine that you are in 1979 when it was released. Really, this should be the way we watch all films, but it's more necessary here. Yes, some of the things that go on in this film don't stack up to what special effects can do today, but George Miller made nearly the best that he could with what he had in the 70s. The story of Mel Gibson's Max going into battle against a biker gang to seek revenge is somehow quite unique and refreshing for a common revenge flick. This picture is thrilling, fun, depressing, and even terrifying. There are a few scenes where the film can nearly qualify as a horror picture. There are even a few romantic scenes between Gibson and co- star Joanne Samuel that are actually quite effective and nice. The biggest thing the film lives for is its intense action sequences. They may not have the visual effects of modern films, but they are just as effective, and even more effective than many films (*cough* Transformers *cough*). The stunts in this movie are immensely exciting, and the ending sequences are great. In fact, the end avoids becoming corny or cliché and even prevents the ""I'm a badass"" goodbye line from the hero to the villain. Yes, Max does give a little mini- monologue, but it's so slick and cool that it works very well. The film is not without its flaws, of course. It takes a while to know what the film is really trying to be about, which may be intended, but is a little strange here. While the editing in the film is usually very good, there are numerous times where the screen fades and wipes to the next shot or scene. Sometimes it's fine, but there are multiple times where it feels unnecessary and distracting. And let's not forget the moments in the film where a young boy is left seemingly unattended; that was definitely a head-scratcher in some moments. George Miller's action flick has become somewhat of a cult classic overtime, and it's not too hard to see why. It was kind of a revolution for the action genre and its influence is still felt to this day. The first film of a wild series--and the start of a long-lasting and achieving career for Mel Gibson--is a ride you are going to want to take if you haven't already.",Mad Max
245,robertandrews-44556,Simple Revenge Film that became a Legend,10,3 July 2018,"Well....the first Mad Max film. Watching this film nowadays is still a delight and it remains as entertaining and violent as when it did when it was released in 1979. I wasn't born when it first came out, and like many others, I only became aware of it after seeing the sequel, The Road Warrior. When I was little, I was forbidden to rent this movie from the video store, as my parents told me it was much too violent and would give me nightmares. Its silly now of course, but at the time, you could see this was a pretty violent film. The plot is simple. In future Australia, a small group of leather-clad police officers are the only law standing after Earth's downfall. They appear to be somewhat competent and on top of things until they make enemies with a violent biker gang led by the frightening psychotic Toecutter. Max is one of these police ifficers, and when Toecutter and his gang kill his best friend, wife, and child, Max sets out in his souped up V8 Interceptor to give the bikers a taste of their own medicine. The original Mad Max is a very simple and cheap film and is WAY different than its three sequels. This movie is almost very similar to other revenge films of the 70's, such as Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left and I Spit on Your Grave. In fact, the biker villains in this film are very much like the villains in Last House on the Left in their psychotic mannerisms and Toecutter reminds me awfully of Krug Stillo. Also, the villains in both movies have the tables turned on them in the name of revenge. Thus, the bad guys in this film are somewhat more realistic than the villains in the sequels.As mentioned, the film is cheap but that is also what gives it its charm. You could definitely see that Mel Gibson was going to go on to become a star. This is still my favorite Mad Max movie and i always love watching it at leadt five times a year.

246,ian_bell,The legend starts here . . .,10,26 April 2010,"If the rumours are correct, Goerge Miller put this futuristic action thriller together for something less than half a million dollars.Take note, James Cameron.I've no idea how Miller did it, but in bringing Mad Max to the screen, along with the Goose, the Toe-cutter et al, he crafted a story with an almost mythic ring to it and gave the world a screen icon who stands alongside The Terminator and even James Bond.The opening shot of a policeman spying on a couple having sex in a field through the viewfinder of his rifle, promises an edgy, perhaps deviant film. A car then races into view, tearing up the Outback at something like ninety miles per hour, and as Max and the Goose rev up their car and motorcycle, so a legend is born.Every single dollar and more is up on the screen, and while the action sequences stand out as both exhilarating, what really elevates Mad Max up a notch is the characterisation. Max is not a killing machine, nor a ruthless agent of the law; he is a family man, and someone merely trying to stay alive. Heroics are not his game. Not yet, at least.The excellent Steve Bisely as Goose is every bit as good - better even perhaps? - as Gibson in the title role. Equally good is Joanne Samuel as our hero's young wife, but for my money the man who really makes this picture is Hugh Keays-Byrne.As the Toe-cutter, Keays-Byrne adds an air of genuine menace to a villain who grows in stature the longer the film goes on. I was not sure whether Keays-Byrne was a genuine English actor or not, but either way he provides a nemesis for Max, and the catalyst for a transformation from home-loving family man to a homicidal loner gunning for revenge as the bleak Australian landscape gives way to a riot of roaring engines, explosions, and tragic deaths.The sequels may have had bigger budgets, but this film stands as an example of what one film director can do when pushing himself, and his crew, to the absolute limit under the merciless antipodean sun.",Mad Max
247,Amigard,Mechanical Ballet,9,10 June 2001,"I admit, I really like mechanical ballets like ""Le Mans"", ""Taxi"", ""Taxi 2"" and the best part of ""Gone in 60 seconds (2000)"". There are not many movies which push me in it, but when there are speed-scenes, I'm lost. This movie can also be put in the mechanical ballet list because it is impossible to see that the budget for this movie was relatively small. In the hands of Hollywood it would have cost a lot more.What I really don't understand is why the original Australian-English had to be changed in American-English. Most of the time I was really angry about the over the top voices and (due to that) the lack of mechanical sounds. Every version with the non-original English should be banned, in fact, every movie should be released in its native language (even animated ones). This to prevent that a movie will be funny because of the language while this was not meant to. Everybody can read subtitles isn't it?",Mad Max
248,DamianThorn,An action packed ride through a grim and cruel world,10,8 June 2014,"Frankly, what strikes me most about this film is that it's likely as relevant today as it was when it was made...if not more so. Mad Max more than anything is the story of a man, a police officer, a husband, a father pushed to his breaking point when his family is murdered by a gang of psychopathic thugs. Casting aside the law he's sworn to uphold he seeks out his revenge at all costs. Yet, this is so much more than a revenge film.Set in what was at the time the not to distant future, Mad Max is today more a portrayal of the world we live in. It's more of a statement to the steady decay of modern society and the laws inability to stop it. In 1979 that decay was really just beginning. Today it's in full swing and shows no signs of slowing down let alone stopping. As I write this I come off a week full of news stories about five mass shootings and crimes so horrific I couldn't and wouldn't write about them here. Enough of that though, let me get to the film itself.In 1979 Mad Max brought Mel Gibson to the world. An incredibly talented, handsome and fresh faced Gibson instantly captured the attention of movie goers and to this day new generations of movie goers continue to discover him. I'm living proof of that. When I first saw Mel Gibson it was in a sequel to this movie called The Road Warrior a few years ago. His talent and ability to portray the emotions of his character instantly caused me to seek out more and more of his films. His portrayal here in Mad Max is some of his finest work, yet it's some of his earliest. He truly shines in this film and as the viewer I never for a moment doubted that he was the character he was portraying. That is the most important quality of any actor, their ability to convince you that they are the character. To draw you in and keep you frozen in each moment that they appear on screen.The rest of the cast does an excellent job as well, particularly the thugs. The film is tense, action filled and draws on your emotions constantly. It can be slightly cheesy at times but those times are rare and not uncommon in films of this genre. The writing is good, the direction, casting and locations are perfect. There are some fantastic car chases and some truly epic crashes. While the first sequel to this film (The Road Warrior) sits firmly in the post apocalyptic genre, Mad Max would best be described as the days just before the world collapsed. However, it does fit in the post apocalyptic arena and is probably best viewed in that light. Any fan of that genre or even action fans in general will definitely enjoy this one. Not to mention Mel Gibson fans, which if your not...you will be after watching this.",Mad Max

It is a classic, but I've found it just watchable.Usually, films have a beginning, a development and an end: this one has a beginning 70 minutes long and an end.

Of course there are some hairstyles and fashions in the movie that does not look right today and the pacing is a little slow by today's standards. But that does not hurt the experience so much that you forget about the good things in the movie. The action scenes are terrific with superior camera work and editing. The stunts are spectacular but not so implausible that you think ""hang on a second. Stuff like that can't happen"" unlike many James Bond movies and Michael Bay flicks. Mel Gibson in his debut is magnificent. He is especially good in the last twenty minutes of the movie when Max really goes mad. The rest of the cast are also good notably Hugh Keays Byrne as the Toecutter. A very memorable villain indeed. The semi-apocalyptic world they live in is also very interesting as it could all happen someday when the world goes nuts. Overall a good example of how little it takes to make a good action flick. You don't need an all star cast or a million dollar budget. All you need is a good director and talented actors. Well done George Miller!",Mad Max

The pace was slow (the movie rushes to its climax in the last 10 minutes) and frequent periods of cars driving and sombre faces tend to get on your nerves after a while.
It's amazing to see what a small role Mel Gibson actually gets as 'Mad Max' - he barely says 10 sentences and his facial expression is almost stationary for the whole film.

I wouldn't suggest this to anyone.The dialogue is witless and predictable. There is almost no character development whatsoever-- all we learn about Max is that he's married and that he's a cop.This movie doesn't fail because of Gibson's acting, which is generally up to par.

However, when a biker gang led by Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) wrecks havoc, Max's sanity will be tested.
Mad Max was a giant hit when it came out in 1979, becoming the highest grossing film in Australia, beating Star Wars (1977). It also started the career of director George Miller, star Mel Gibson and, most importantly, it spawned the Mad Max series, which include this film, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981), Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). However, i myself am not a big fan of this film. I heard a lot of great things about this film, and i think i might have set my expectations too high and maybe i should rewatch it one day, but so far i have mixed feelings for it.
Pros: The acting is really good, Mel Gibson really puts a lot of effort when playing Max.
Toecutter is an amazing, unpredictable and horrifying villain and Hugh Keays-Byrne is simply amazing in this role.
The stunts look spectacular considering the low bugdet, and still hold up well today.
The music, especially during the opening credits and closing credits.
Overall, this is one film that everyone should see at least once since it had such an cultural impact.
Cons: My main problem with the film is that it is quite boring.
The plot was really slow moving for me.
Sometimes, the film is pointlesly cruel, like for example a dog is murdered.

Mad Max is set in a post apocalyptic era where gas is scarce and gangs rule the outback. It's an interesting concept, but it's not really explained, it is what it is. You know? If you want your explanation on this, you need to watch the first two minutes of Mad Max 2 (or The Road Warrior). But I guess this is one of those films where story doesn't really matter, so when you hit a gap, just nod your head. What tears me about this movie, obviously, are the car sequences. George Miller odes a great job filming and coordinating all the action for these car sequences. I'm not to sure what it was, but I felt almost a rhythm to the shots he used and how they were moving or tight and how they were all spliced together, it really makes up for the completely lack luster story.

265,FPilot,Finally Got the DVD,6,23 April 2006,"Hey.Got the DVD and got around to seeing it overnight. I'll probably see it again sometime very soon too. But I have to say this first: The audio track is really messed up. The dialog is recorded too soft and the sound effects and music are too loud. This frustrated my father with him perpetually resetting the volume on our TV set while trying to follow the speeches. The sound probably worked better in theaters, but for a home system it doesn't work well at all. I know the filmmakers probably didn't have a choice. I guess when I watch it again, I'll put the closed captioning on.So as not to repeat (or dispute) anything said by others up to now, a few thoughts of my own: I saw ""The Cars That Ate Paris"" last year on cable, and I'm thinking of it now as a kind of prelude to ""Mad Max"", if not an actual prequel. You see, in ""Cars"" you have a societal breakdown of the kind that could produce a world like ""Mad Max""'s. The same goes for Roger Corman's dark comedy ""Gas-s-s-s""...but ""Cars That Ate Paris"" is a better match. Heck, in ""Cars"" you even have a similar story about a man wrestling with issues of conscience and madness in the face of psychological trauma, in addition to the vehicular violence.Perspective for the times...going into the end of the Seventies, you had Hal Needham's stunt spectacle movies like ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Hooper"" in theaters...and I bet George Miller saw them and got ideas from them in making ""Mad Max"". And then there was Corman and his multitude of biker gang movies and ""Death Race 2000"".I'm not saying Miller wasn't an innovator...he certainly was. His use of camera angles in ""Mad Max"" is particularly striking. ""Mad Max"" didn't start a trend so much as it took existing trends, merged them, and threw them into a new direction that is still influential some 25 years later.One of the posters included in the DVD gallery called ""Mad Max"" ""The 'Easy Rider' of the Eighties""...and that was a good description of its stature, at least. In my video collection, I have at least three ""Mad Max""/""Road Warrior"" imitators that I can think of. I suppose the thinking of the age was if George Miller could do what he did with such a small budget, why not somebody else? And of course, they all failed...because they matched the style but not the substance.Somebody at my alma mater High School had a souped-up black Mustang fastback with the slogan ""Mad Max"" on the windshield.",Mad Max

First off though, some positives: I loved the setting. It's a world where everything has just started to descend into madness, where people have lost sight of what's good and take to the roads to carry out insane acts of evil. Hardly any rules, no way to stop them. A world where innocent people like Max's family are targeted. It's a difficult place to put your characters in. Mel Gibson is so young! He does a great Aussie accent and delivers a great performance. The action scenes are cool and are executed well as well, with great stunts and camerawork, especially for an indie. However, as I've said, I've got big problems. First and foremost, the offensive portrayal of the evil, danger-to-women and effeminate academics that protect them. It's very obvious and exaggerated. Look, maaybe it's just a coincidence that the evil guy happens to be a flamboyant gay man and all the good guys are masculine straight men, but I stand my ground. It's also a cheap way to make fun of bad guys that doesn't have any need. The editing was a bit rushed sometimes and the score was very obnoxiously used. The plot as well... I was just a little disappointed that it wasn't as insane as Fury Road, but I can see what it's going for. It's a sadder tale. Still though, found issue with the pacing. Look, I want to be fair, it might be something that I would recommend to people I guess, and it would've been very good for the time, and it makes me really want to see Road Warrior.",Mad Max

I guess the film was limited by a low budget, but I still can't help but feel this film was very slow on the uptake. I couldn't really tell you what happened for the first hour or so of this film. It wasn't boring as such, just kind of nothing- y. I wasn't a big fan of Hugh Keays-Byrne as Toecutter but that's just personal preference. I have to say, I found the soundtrack to be awful. Both the score and the mixing. At times the dialogue was almost inaudible and I found myself reaching for the remote several times during the film turning it up and down according to what was happening, I'd recommend watching with headphones if possible. As for the score, it was rather cheesy and dated. Then again, this is often the case in movies from this era. Worth a watch but don't expect too much high-octane action, because you will probably be disappointed due to the film's low budget.",Mad Max
270,jordanhjacobs,Mad Max Vs. The Test of Time,6,26 May 2015,"I'm born in '86 so I can't appreciate certain levels of this movie. I feel like it's one of a kind. There aren't many movies from back then, that could stand up to the remakes of today. Yes it's odd, old, and sometimes a bit far fetched. There is just no denying it's epicness. I can't believe Mel Gibson got picked for this role because his buddy needed a ride to the audition. Mel shows up with his face punched in from a drunken brawl and the director spotted him and gave him the lead role! Just goes to show you, always get into bar fights, you could end up like Mel Gibson! Stay tuned for my reviews of Mad Max II, and Mad Max III - Tina Turner's Hair.",Mad Max
271,scott-harding,I should have left it another 35 years !!!,1,21 November 2014,"If the public didn't know Director George Miller was gay when this movie first aired then 30 minutes in it must have been apparently clear. His depiction of ""Bad-Ass Bikers"" must have read ""Beastly Men"" in his screenplay, alongside ""Butch Leather Clad Good-Guys"". I'll hold my hands up and say I've just watched this 35 years after its release and there are shockingly few positives to this movie. An ardent fan of Mel Gibson I couldn't but laugh at his acting and the truly atrocious American dubbing. Sheila Florence (a.k.a Lizzie Birdsworth, Prisoner: Cell Block H) gives the best performance but even she can't make Mel being shot with a hand gun from half a mile away believable. With lines like ""Hay fella, you're a Turkey, know that"" and the use on World War 1 Broomhandle Mauser pistols, this film fails on every level...",Mad Max
272,reece-beale,"Not bad, but not as good as the hype.",6,21 May 2015,"I really wanted to like Mad Max more, I'd heard lots about it over the years and never got round to watch it, until recently, and I was kind of disappointed.I can appreciate the fact that the film was brilliant for it's time, it's an iconic piece of Australian cinema and clearly, it will stand the test of time and will be for years to come. Unfortunately, if you strip back this concept, you get quite a boring film. I watched the film and expected it to go somewhere, and it never did and despite the fast paced nature of the shots in the film, the majority of the film was very slow.What I loved about the film was that there was such a clear opposition between good and evil. A lot of films test the boundary and use anti-hero's, purposely to blur this line - in this case, the film shows that their is an obvious divide between good and evil, and it enhances the effectiveness of the violence. Another good point (as I mentioned) was the fast paced nature of the film, you constantly feel like you're part of this chase between the police and the biker gang, it's just a shame that a lot of the shots and parts of these scenes were very similar, that led to a lack of interest at point.Overall, I have an appreciation for this film as it kickstarted a major series and it was nothing like I have ever seen before.",Mad Max
273,smugler5369,Not a good movie,4,4 August 2015,"I figured I should go back and watch the earlier movies for a better grasp on the story and the Mad Max universe in general but I wish that I hadn't.We are supposed to believe that it is a post apocalyptic world but none of the characters act like. If you really lived in a world where law and order is the exception, where there are roving gangs; raping and murdering with near impunity -would you (being extremely defenseless) take your infant to an unknown place with unknown people just for damn ice cream? -would even take road trip holidays? lol On top of it all people seem to have pretty good access to a lot of consumer goods and factory made items for a supposedly post apocalyptic word.Over all the movie is littered with clichés, has an easily predictable and derivative plot, and the acting is so-so at best. To be honest I don't know whether all of the movies from around this time were off this 'quality' -in which case this movie could actually be comparatively good.",Mad Max
274,The_Badger_Man,"An Important, Not a Good Film",4,13 May 2015,"Mad Max helped launch the career of Mel Gibson, made a killing at the box office, and, most importantly, allowed George Miller to follow up with a grand and far superior sequel.This first installment contains cool car chase scenes and a cool, baby- faced Mel Gibson. However, most of this takes place in the opening sequence. The scenes that follow consist of unsettling violence, unmemorable characters, and confusing camera-work. As with many low-budgeted films, this movie has not aged well.As it is very Australian in feeling and accent, subtitles may help for any non-Australian audiences.",Mad Max

Needless to say, I was captivated by the story and it wasn't long before I got to watch the sequels. Even 35 years later, Mad Max remains a fresh film with a fresh plot - a police officer of a more or less dysfunctional patrol force pitted against a ruthless road gang in a collapsing society. The film offers a number of things that, sadly, not many movies nowadays have - an original idea, uncompromising (yet measured) violence, the fantastic and remembering background of an apocalyptic Australia, a shining Mel Gibson, and last but not least, zero self-indulgence. Mad Max is pure entertainment, and if you're bored or annoyed with billion-range revenue, CGI-laden plastic, you should definitely watch or re-watch this title.",Mad Max

I was so disappointed that I had to write this review. The plot was written on a bunch of unnatural-stupid human decisions. I don't understand why Goose rides to just fall for no reason and how did they know he was coming back. The wife leaves Mel Gibson, Mel Gibson leaves his son and all of them leave Mel Gibson. Above all, how does one not manage to dodge at least one motorcycle from a stable vehicle like car.How does Mel Gibson not see the ToeCutter ""hiding"" in a vast land of nothing but grass. The movie justifies its title though. I can't see any sense in this film whatsoever.",Mad Max

Cult classic or not, and this is nothing on the Mad Max franchise, this is just a bad MOVIE. While Gibson lead the film with a genuinely enjoyable performance, his strength is overshadowed by the film itself. The music is misplaced and create mixed messages in nearly every scene. The transitions are abrupt and strange. The use of foreshadowing is heavy handed to the point of being superfluous (I.E. the sound of crows whenever something bad is going to happen, even when there are no birds in sight). It feels less like an ""action thriller"" and more like a rambling art student film. They're are some good pieces, again Gibson is perfect for his role and some pieces are truly entertaining, but overall it was messy and scattered.",Mad Max
278,Dan_the_DutchMan,After nearly 30 years still an amazing trip at high speed,7,11 January 2008,"After not seeing it for about seven years, I just saw it on DVD for the first time. I remembered it as an exciting near-chaos-future adventure with highway cops in muscle cars and one insane biker gang. It's great how it keeps on standing the test of time. High speed and raw power are of every age, past and future. The way the highway action is shot in this movie simply stays exhilarating, putting it in the top ranking of best high-speed-chase movies ever. Seeing the camera follow the highway marker at high speed, along with the sound of a bike- or V8-engine delivers a Mad and chaotic but really cool result. The pace of the movie remains considerably high, without many slow moments.Some aspects of the movie have (understandably) dated. Obviously the 70's clothing and hair styles. Sometimes the acting is a little over the top, and some characters could come directly from a comic book. And of course the story is not that deep or difficult. It's partly action-thriller, partly science fiction adventure. All weaknesses are covered and compensated by lots of a-moral fun though.At the heart of this one of a kind look movie, there is a hero character named Max. This speed-demon-cop is at the top of his game on the highway, ruthlessly dealing with maniacs ravaging his jurisdiction. But he is also a happy family man with his wife and son. This duality makes the character human, timeless and very memorable. In some scenes you can clearly see Mel Gibson was only just getting into acting. For a rookie he was doing a good job nonetheless.Others strengths lie within the scary nature of the biker gang. An extravagant rag-tag band of maniacs, led by the iconic villain The ToeCutter. To this day, their actions remain tough and very disturbing. It will have you staring at the screen dead serious, making Max' battle against them even more gratifying.There is much to say about this movie, but first and foremost it is a must see. A cult classic still as enjoyable as it was nearly 30 years ago.",Mad Max
279,apolysus,"In the land of the free, we are helpless.",7,30 April 2020,"Screeching tires and clouds of dust fill the air as you embark on your way. The hot sun creates mirage on the long road ahead. For a lot of people in the 70's, this was what freedom felt like. In Mad Max we see a different side of this ""Easy Rider"" coin.The 2015 movie, ""Fury Road"" is what introduced a lot of people to the franchise. When younger generations such as myself go back to the first movie they will find that it is less fiction oriented. Although Mad Max does have a dystopian quality to it, the setting feels familiar and captures a spiritual desire for freedom. At the same time, the American desert roads also evoke a feeling of helplessness. The same feeling you get when you find yourself out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by rusted scrap metal and dry land. This junk yard aesthetic is the heart of the movie and is as much present on the road as it is in the city and police station. The road cops of desperately try to uphold a sense of reason in a world that has long since lost it's order.The only complaint I have with the movie is the pacing. Though I was never bored in the first and second act. I felt as though the third act tied everything up a bit to quickly. Afterwards the movie also ends rather abruptly. In way this does emphasise the brutality of it all. You should be advised that the movie will not hold back on shocking you with well executed stunt work and lovable characters that go through a lot. If you felt bad for John Wick, than do hold on for a similar roller coaster that builds up to an inevitable confrontation.(+) Great atmospheric world.
(+) Unique and charismatic characters.
(-) Underwhelming third act.",Mad Max
280,Rancor-3,"Strange nowadays, but still good.",6,17 September 2004,"It's a strange movie at this point in time. The action sequences are highly dated, so it left me feeling a little odd.However, after a day of pondering on it, I have come to the conclusion that I actually really liked the movie. Despite it's apparent oddities, there are some really good ideas involved. It doesn't turn Max into a superhero, necessarily. It has a somewhat down to Earth, yet distinctly alien feel to it.I was fortunate enough to experience the non-dubbed actual Australian accented mono audio tracks, which, heretofore, were overdubbed by American voices (yes, even Mel Gibson, himself, had his voice recorded on) so a lot of the heart has remained, which, I can imagine, was sapped upon first showing to American audiences.The scenery and imagery put together a great sci-fi post-apocalyptic flick, when you really think about it.I'm tetering between a 4 and a 5, but for now I'll settle on rating of four motorcycle gangs out of five.",Mad Max
281,macedones,A cult classic that doesn't live up to its name,3,15 May 2015,"I was just a teenager when I first watched Mad Max. And ten years later I've decided to re watch it. Right after I was done, a question came to mind: Was it that bad? Mad Max is one of those movies that everybody considers to be top notch because it was visionary and made with such low budget. I get it. It was really visionary for the time it was made. But does that mean the movie is good? The answer is no.Starting with the title. If someone knows to answer how could Max be considered even close to Mad, please enlighten me. There is nothing in Max's personality that makes him a mad guy. What does he do when his best friend Goose gets burned alive by the Toecutter gang? He goes to Fifi and delivers his retirement agreement. His motives? He states that being a cop is too much of a dangerous life. What about the scene where the gang member bails out of jail? The one that flips out and gets really ""mad"" is Goose, not Max. I mean, if you put a title like this in a movie, at least make the character named after it with a personality that fits. Max goes throughout the entire movie being a calm and respectable guy. The only part where he shows himself as a cruel person is the last scene, where he locks one of the bad guys to a flaming car and gives him a saw to cut through his ankle if he wants to live. The first half of the movie also creates another issue with the title. It is focused on Goose while we see Max like some kind of a sideshow. I got myself questioning what Max's character had to do with the story despite being the ""hero"" that Fifi always insisted to state.One other flaw that really bugged me was the presence of the law inside a lawless post-apocalyptic world. Right at the beginning of the movie, it is presented to us that in a near future only exists the madmen and the main force patrol. OK, cool. So what was the lawyer who came to rescue the gang member from jail doing inside this world? A chaotic world where lunatic bikers are allowed to roam free and rape everybody is not lawless enough to discard the need of lawyers? It just doesn't make sense. I think George Miller wasn't worried in explaining things.My conclusions? The plot is bad, the acting is bad, the execution is bad. Even for a low budget movie. The only good thing about it is the concept that came to be an inspiration to future movies and video games. Mad Max does not live up to its name. It is a revenge film lacking the feeling of revenge. If you're into trash car chasing movies with dumb action scenes, that might be your thing. This one just didn't do it for me.",Mad Max
282,deneen0,"Excellent Action Flick, if a little cheesy at times",8,7 May 2008,"Yes this movie is good and yes it has some cheesy love scenes, but that only adds to the story which is vital to the movie. The movie takes place during a time of anarchy and the small fraction of civilization still trying to hang on. Max Rockatansky is part of the Main Force Patrol, the only thing standing between civilization and total chaos. This movie has some of the coolest chase scenes which are only outdone by its sequel ""The Road Warrior"". Surprisingly, there isn't so much gun play as there is vehicle carnage (but the scene where Max blasts Bubba with the shotgun is awesome). The story is good and the action scenes are well done for a movie at this time. Overall, the movie is fun to watch and it is a good setup to Mad Max 2.",Mad Max
283,pygmydynamo,WOW! Science fiction served up manly-style!,2,8 August 2004,"Ah, the apocalypse. It is a time when men are men. Like West Side Story, gangs roam about in leather and establish vague pecking orders, alternatively accomplishing grim deeds and then being easily subdued by shotgun grannies. Well, you know. It's mad! But in this dark, foreboding science fiction, awful things can happen where you least (most?) expect them, and the only true pleasure comes from hearing a nice engine vroom. Something about the lawless future causes most men to hop around like cocaine monkeys, resemble Tim Blake Nelson, and most importantly of all, lounge singers to hold their microphone like they're churning butter. Lick my lips!Mad Max has EVERY trapping possible of a bad revenge flick, mad doses of sleaze, and more than a dash of professional wrestling. If this sounds like a good time to you, then go get 'im tiger! Sights that await you include pretty young things running in tight shorts, villains who have no motivation other than to be evil, victims who run down open roads to flee from cars. But if that sounds painful and predictable, never fear, your manipulative violence is sprinkled with long, meaningful stretches of road with which you can reflect.

284,Fillfillbust,A Classic!,10,31 July 2010,"Mad Max was Mel Gibson's break though film back in 1979. This low budget film really packs a wallop and set new standards in filming breathtaking car chases. It's essentially a pulp comic book brought to life. A raw and exciting film that set the stage for two powerful sequels.The police, sporting black leather uniforms and driving colorful high speed cruisers that are stationed at the Halls of Justice and are constantly under siege. The bad guys are a malicious motorcycle gang led by a crazed and psychopathic goon named Toecutter. After one of Toecutter's cronies is killed by Max, Toecutter is looking for some serious payback, but he's messing with the wrong cop...you don't wanna get Max mad.The production design coveys a world that's gone to hell and captures the grim atmosphere perfectly. Brian May's (not the guitarist from Queen) exciting music score gives the film a larger than life quality. Director George Miller makes the most of his small budget. The chase sequences and editing is terrific.",Mad Max
285,X-ecutioner,A wonderful film,10,18 August 2004,"For me, Mad Max is THE post apocolyptic film. Although many people say Mad Max 2 is better, I do agree that it is better in some ways but i still feel that Mad Max 1 is overall more enjoyable and I can tell you why.1) The major characters: Although the Humungus in Mad Max 2 is a commendable villain. I feel that the Toecutter is a very menacing person and also his gang are a larger part than the gang in Mad Max 2. The Toecutter and his gang are much more menacing, Buba, Johnny the Boy, Cantalini and the others are as much villains as the Toecutter himself. Also, Max is a more emotional character and it is good to see the good guy being affected by the actions of the villains. Because he looks younger, I felt more sympathetic to him than in the second film.2) The Idea: Although basing Mad Max 2 around the search and constant struggle for oil, the first film is not as desperate or post apocolyptic. This means that the actions taken by hte characters are done for more personal reasons than the ever present search for fuel. This makes the interactions between characters more personal.3) the Supporting Characters: I love the Goose, sorry, I loved the Goose, I loved Max's wife, I loved the Police Chief, I liked all the good guys, I hissed at the bad people. One of my favourite parts in the film is when the gang park in a town and some get off their bike and start dancing slowly and awkwardly as if they hadn't been on their feet for some time.4) the Vehicles: I want a Pursuit Special with Turbo Charger. V8 on methane Super Hot!!! YUM!!! The chases are brilliant but don't quite equal the final chase in Mad Max 2.Conclusion: Both are brilliant films but I feel that Mad Max is overall better than Mad Max 2 but not by much, if you see one and enjoyed it, you need to see the other.A+",Mad Max

287,zauberzerao,Mad Max (1979) — 82/100,8,16 January 2012,"Okay, so the original Mad Max lacks Veron Wells' awesomeness. I admit it, okay!? In spite of that, it is in my ever-humble opinion that the original is a superior film to its successor. By what kind of margin? I wouldn't know, to be honest, but it surely isn't marginal? Ho! Ho! Ho! Okay, bad English-tutor joke.In all seriousness, what Road Warrior has, Mad Max matches. The only thing that the original doesn't have, of course, is a rabid pack of chap-wearing, motorbike-riding (and perhaps even, cannibalistic) vandals bent on wreaking as much havoc on the scant survivors of a bizzaro post- apocalyptic world to expropriate for itself a generous supply of gasoline. Yeah, but apart from that little detail, Mad Max still holds its ground.Max, too, bolsters a better story. When we see Max snap, we see Max snap. So, at this juncture, the movie goes from conventional car-chasing pop-corn flick to bent-on-revenge-with-nothing-to-lose flick. Sure, you still have Bronson's Death Wish, but this one, combined with all the car-chasing machismo, and the fact that it is an Australian production, gives it some—I don't know—unique quality?Gibson's Australian accent is something to behold too.

Secondly I heard of some bad ass named mad max, which to me seemed like a puss. He quit after his friend was killed? really? What a d-bag? I can't understand why Mel Gibson was so highly regarded in this...he seemed average to me.

As the main character of this futuristic Australian landscape film , he takes you on a ride into the wastelands of roaming biker gangs who cause havoc on everything in their path. Eventually the storyline narrows into a vendetta between Max and the bikers after they murder his wife and child on the highway. Max and his companion police officers use the full extent of their iconic Aussie muscle cars in police livery to hunt down these rogue bikers and try and restore peace to the little towns in the bikers paths. Very notable acting also can be seen from others such as Steve Bisley as the Motorcycle Cop ""Goose"" and Hugh Keys Byrne as the Head Biker ""The Toecutter"". This film created an Aussie Cult only rivaled by Star Wars fans... and regular events and collectibles are had by many devoted MAD MAX fans from all round the world. The replicas of the original MAD MAX car featured in the film are now sought by many overseas and local collectors, and fetch as much as $85000 Aussie dollars for a car that was originally sold for around $8000 in its day. Forget Hollywood Mel Gibson , you made it here in Australia !This film was wasted on the American public ... who got to see a dubbed version of the film which took all the reality of Australia outof the movie. The landscape and action of the film are all real , and thus you would have to be a true Australian to see the reality of it all. Understandably Americans have no idea of reality when it comes to their Hollywood fake films , full of computer animated scenes , and mindless rubbish.

298,skyglide,"Raw, vicious and Superb.",9,28 August 2011,"Directed by George Miller back in 1979, Mad Max became a cult classic. It's a raw, vicious piece of cinema that still packs a punch over 30 years later. The film opens perfectly, with a high octane Police chase. A crazed maniac calling himself the Nightrider speeds across the highways with police in tow.''You see me Toecutter? You see me man?!!''Played by Vince Gil, wild eyed and heavily bearded, with chick at his side, this is an important scene, as not only does it cleverly introduce Max and showcase why he's such an asset to the police, but also anchors the rest of the film's story. Gibson's Max is superb. His devotion to being a family man is the heart of the film, giving proceedings extra depth. The scenes of him at home with wife and child are the calm before the storm, at times being the only normality amongst a world gone mad.There are a few solid performances. Roger Ward as Fifi, Max's Military-Esq Captain. Imposing, loud and with a tendency to walk around shirtless yet sporting a silk scarf, is so fearful of having Max quit he resorts to big speeches and even bribery. Steve Bisley's Goose, the wild-man of the Police Force and also Max's closest friend is great. Bringing a few comedy moments. ''What a turkey! Hey fella! your a turkey!''Hugh Keys-Burn does a star turn as the demented Toecutter, the leader of a Biker Gang. Toecutter's thirst for anarchy and bizarre behaviour is quite chilling. Embracing the violence and leading a pride of misfits that literally hang off every word he says.But the main stars of the show are the vehicles. They speed around, roll and fly through the air. Twisted metal and debris on every street corner. There is a magnificent scene where Max is introduced to The Last Of The V8s. The roar of the engine and squeal of the belt makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck, whether you're a petrol-head or not, leaving Max staring trance-like into the supercharger. ''He's in a Coma, man!''Mad Max is low budget and very Australian. But this gives it a look like no other movie. The stunts have rarely been bettered over the years, and when you get to see a high speed crash without any hint of CGI, it really does impress. Although the horrors of this apocalyptic nightmare are inevitable, there is something present that just makes Max so damn chilling. The bright colours of the police vehicles and the outlandish behaviour of some of the characters are almost comic book like, and the sudden swing from a darkly comic moment to a flash of ultraviolence is deeply unsettling. Something else noticeable is the inclusion of some very odd moments, that have no real explanation, which I am sure are there just to unsettle. For instance, a Police Official dressed in a smart suit leaves the station and on the way out randomly puts on a Kendo fighters mask as he walks away. Another being a very quick shot of Max's son sat playing with toys, one of which being a replica hand gun. Brief but unsettling.The only slight negative (without giving away any spoilers), is it does take Max rather a long time to get Mad. There is a nice build up and you have a feeling of unease right up to that point. But a lot is crammed into the last 15 minutes, which doesn't disappoint but leaves you with the taste for more.If you've never had the pleasure of seeing this movie, I suggest you do. In terms of action packed motor carnage and some of the most undesirables ever to appear on screen Mad Max has never been beaten or equalled, apart from one film- Mad Max 2. Which is just as essential. Do yourself a favour and buy them both.",Mad Max
299,nyvlem7,Boring.,3,18 March 2021,"The first and last time that I'll see this most boring movie.Music is repetitive, dialogue is not really great and shallow characters. The cinematography is good, with rich colours which can be enjoyed in 4K.The budget was $350k, so they had to use very cheap props and hired/borrowed the motorcycles.I never got the feeling that it was a crazy country they'd live in - full of dangers.",Mad Max
300,scottstilson,Stunts make the movie worth watching; sound mixing almost makes it unwatchable,5,6 July 2015,"Apparently the film that made Mel Gibson an international star way back in 1980, this budget Australian action movie would have been rated higher by me had the sound mixing not made it impossible to make out the dialogue without cranking up the volume, and perhaps another half-star had the score not featured endless runs of bottomed-out tympani, ear-piercingly muted trumpets, and heavy-handed, supposedly suspense-inducing violins.Actually, because of these sonic issues and the fact that it features a young, now very famous handsome male lead, the film reminded me very much of Legend, that fantasy Tom Cruise vehicle from about the same time period. Both of those movies had one or two very, very strong points: Legend's highlights were its neo-Gotchic tone and its terrifying puppetry; Mad Max excels in the daringly gruesome automobile stunts it pulls. That alone -- well, plus hearing Mel Gibson talk in his native Australian accent -- make the movie worth watching. Among the film's non-aural weaknesses are its failure to provide a sense of time or space, and its weak narrative line.",Mad Max
301,ArturRinne,Pretty Good!,6,1 May 2018,"I hadn't seen the first Mad Max movies. So i started to watch them. And my thoughts on The first one are good. It isn't anything really special, but what i like is that with a really small budget they did some cool action scenes.
The first half of the movie is pretty average and boring for me. But the second half is much better.
The Acting goes from bad to good. Nothing too special but still pretty good.
The stunts are really good and i really liked what they pulled off.

302,t-man-7,Classic Australian History,10,8 August 1999,"This is an awesome movie with wicked acting, screenplay and soundtrack. MM is a very well known movie throughout Australia. In fact, a close mate of mine put ""MFP Pursuit"" in big letters on the back of his car and the amount of times people recite the lines out loud while at the traffic lights is incredible. ""I AM THE TOE-CUTTER!!!""Apart from all of MM's unreal qualities, one of the cool things about the locations is that I see them nearly everyday. They are just common roads and places in Melbourne!I'm not too sure, but I think this film was also a big hit in America, but the voices were overdubbed in their release. For the yanks reading this review, get the original Aussie version, if can understand us.

304,skyhighatrist550,"Blistering, kenetic, energetic road rage that inspired a generation and didn't stop there!",9,13 July 2008,"Back when I was a kid at the tender age of 7 I was introduced to the Mad Max trilogy of films which my parents all had preserved on tape which I, ironically, watched all in reverse starting with Beyond Thunderdome, The Road Warrior and then this film. While The Road Warrior remains undoubtedly my favorit, the film I remember least from the trilogy was surprisingly Mad Max 1.Now, I recently purchased the DVD set which retains the original Australian audio for Mad Max 1 and what do I think of it after some 14 years later?: A lot better then I first remember it. Set in a destopic Australian local outback on the verge of econimic breakdown, Max Rockatansky(Mel Gibson) is a family man of a wife and child as well as being the head patroleman of a small unit of police officers who are trying desperately to protect the local citizens from the dangerous roads which are running rampant with savage biker gangs and speedfreaks, one gang of which, lead by main villain Toecutter, have marked Max for death after he causes the death of one of they're friends called the 'Nightrider' in an excellerating car chase.Mel Gibson has never had a more definitive role, even if his and the general dialogue and acting are a bit vague at times, it's enough to bring light to the characters and there lives and how they handle they're situations.The evil Biker gang themselves are another highlight of the film as they're wicked cross metal/punk cosumes and motorcycles are infinitely awesome! Hugh Keays-Byrne plays a memorable main villain as the sadistic Toecutter and has some quite memorable lines in the film to boot(this is Cundalini, Cundalini wants his arm back).It also must be said that Goerge Miller has done a very commendable job with the relatively low budget he was given to make Mad Max as I feel the low production quality actually helps flesh out the impendingly doomed world in which Max lives and accentuates it well for the time it was made(1979).In short, this is an insperetional road rage masterpiece that will go down in film history with cult acclaim let alone the breaking ground for Australiens and only gets better as all the aspects that made Mad Max 1 so great get vastly expanded on in it's sequel: The Road Warrior.",Mad Max
305,chasemeace,You can't kill Mad Max,6,18 February 2011,"Mad Max is a fantastic movie, and today remains one of my favorites, however, there are many flaws, as with any movie.First off, the good parts of the movie. The first being the one noticed right at the beginning, and that is the portrayal of just how desolate and chaotic the world has become. Although, Mad Max better gave us the knowledge that every man has a breaking point. Max, without any need of dialogue or monologue (a true feat, indeed), is shown to have been totally broken, maybe even insane, after a horrible tragedy, mainly by Max's total willingness to die in the midst of his vengeance, and lack of any real emotion. Also, early in the movie it is clearly recognizable that Max loves his family and vice versa.However, every movie has its flaws. The largest of the flaws exists in the beginning scenes of the movie, where the dialogue is awkward and is lacking in flow. Fortunately, this stops after about a quarter of the way into the movie. Even then, it causes my rating to go down a full star.I fully recommend this movie.",Mad Max

I still love it. I know it's not exactly Citizen Kane or The Shawshank Redemption or anything but this is a great movie for what it is. Say what you will about him today but this was a great role that made Mel Gibson a star and he was great back then as a selfish-turned-hero kick-bum post-apocalyptic road warrior. Watching this it's hard to believe he went on to win a freaking Oscar or that he would then go totally bat-shot crazy but it just adds to how fun watching this movie is, it is like it is actually the real Mel and he's not acting. He's a nut! Fun movie.",Mad Max
307,cj_atkinsonbsc,Such a wicked budget movie!,8,14 July 2015,"A warning to those who haven't seen this movie yet... DON'T WATCH THE American DUBBED VERSION - it's stupid and weak. Please watch the original Australian version because the dialogue is great and quotable... Sorry for screaming this, but I mean it. e.g. Aussie version: ""you'd better send a meat truck. Tommy's copped a saucepan in the throat"". (tough, rough and real Aussie voice)American version: ""boring blah blah blah...send an ambulance."" (fake John Wayne voice)Anyway, I remember as a young child in 1980 being woken up by a cacophony of loud engine sounds, screeching tyres and a booming brass instrument sound track screaming through the floor from the downstairs living room. The next day I asked my parents about the noise. My Dad started going on about this policeman guy who had his hands full and my Mum shaking her head saying the baddies were really horrible. But they wouldn't let me see it...Jump ahead 9 years: I was in the local video store and saw this title with a man wearing a weird helmet pistol pointing a double barrelled shot gun at me... I remembered the Betamax video in the living room many years before. I rented this VHS out, which was naughty because it was an 18 cert movie. Oh my goodness me! The first 10 minutes was amazing! I was hooked. The movie is a rough, tough action movie with dozens of memorable moments I still enjoy thinking about. The bad guys were/are so scary. They are absolutely mad - in an unnervingly realistic way. That bit when one of them burns his own arm with a cigarette lighter, only to blow it out again because it hurt... LOL - nuts, man. Totally nuts. After watching the movie, I immediately went round knocking on my friend's doors telling them to come round to mine and watch it. They were enthralled too. This led to many, many dangerous push bike chases and crashes LOL! Even today, I still sometimes just throw on the first 10 minutes and the Goose ride, on full volume, just for a little adrenaline buzz 8oD. In my opinion, this is by far Mel Gibson's best role - though I liked him in Brave Heart, even though that was a bit cheesy. He is excellent as Max and steals the screen whenever he appears. A real star in the making. The camera work is really exciting too, with the camera close to the tarmac on the fastest Kawasaki bikes on Earth at the time... That alone is work of art. The stunts are amazing. There is one bit where one of the bikers actually had a crashing bike smack him on the head - BANG! One thing that really stands out in my mind, apart from The Goose, Max and the first chase, is the creepiness of the bad guys. They are totally convincing as a gang of nutters. Really scary. They actually do my head in, even to this day. Toecutter certainly is the boss of that almost uncontrollable group and is a fantastic baddie. The movie is worth watching simply for the baddies, let alone anything else. ...Oh yeah, the naked guy running away across the fields with a bleeding bottom was a surprise... On a deeper note, there is something really eerily disturbing about the whole theme and the very human reactions and involvement of all the cast. At first glance, some of the moments might seem a bit wooden, especially from the extras, but real people who aren't ""thespians"" in real life situations often are. The sense of societal breakdown, the desperation, the anxiety are quite disturbing. The psychological aspects of the main characters, both good and bad is really compelling and worth a well worded essay in itself. There is so much to say about this movie, but I'll finish by saying if you like action movies and haven't yet seen this one yet, check it out!PS I quickly wrote this review on the fly, but the main reason for starting this unplanned review was to recommend to people not to watch (or listen) to the pathetic American dubbing. It sucks. I know why they did it, but if the distributors were worried that their local American audiences wouldn't understand un-Hollywood English, they should have used subtitles. The rest of the English speaking world seems to understand Australian English because the Australian actors do speak English. Anyway, the Aussie dialogue is fantastic and far, far more Human and real.",Mad Max

309,weisszaman-20009,Shows its Age,6,22 November 2020,A pretty solid story with some great characters thrown in made this a decent film for me. The baby in the movie is pointless and it shows when the director forgets to put him in some scenes where he should be or especially when he's forgotten outside the farm house by his parents. When toecutter dies by getting hit by the semi was probably the best scene. I love how his body gets dragged under. Looked amazing.,Mad Max
310,david-serna,Is this the future?,8,14 July 2006,"I enjoyed this movie and have watched it many times over since I saw it for the first time in the early 80s.I remember watching it In college,many moons ago.I guess Mel Gibson has done a little more with his career than mine.Never the less this movie seems to have more interest these days than ever before.It's all about fuel.Gangs rule the roads.Stealing,robbing,raping,killing.The gangs do and take what they want.Is this all do to fuel?.Even a v8 engine is a cause for celebration.Max is from the start, the man,a police officer.He is the the one they all look too.Most cop cars have pursuit on the back.His says Interceptor.The problem is he,s getting burnt out.Join the club.He has a young family and wants out.He try's hard but things keep pulling him back.His chief try's anything not to lose him even a little B.S. A new Interceptor with a V-8 does the trick this time.If I remember correctly,the mechanic says,""It's the last of the V-8s"" as Max stares at it like a huge PC of fillet Mignon or something else, But time is still running out.The gangs have it out for the bronze which the cops are called due to there badge.Max's family and friends are not left out after Max does a job on the gang leader.The opening scene is what catches you, its a great chase,and you could see it from the start Max is scary cool ,as the bad guy and him play chicken on the road.When he loses everything thats when all hell breaks loose, he gets mean.Is this the future? $3.50 a gallon and rising.Whats next, The Road Warrior, that's a lot worst.See Mel Gibson when he did not have as much pull as he does now.It's one look at a not so nice future.",Mad Max

Society seems ill equipped to deal with it them.Acting, writing, story acceptable. Not memorable--to the good or bad. My favorite's feature of the film is the motorcycles--they bad guys ride Kawasaki KZs--the greatest bike of it's time. This makes complete sense, of course.

Don't have too high of an expectation because it is kind of a low budget movie. There are so many good moments and plus it has a gripping story and stunts. I love this movie to death and it is followed up by another classic in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior. It is a great action flick. It's at least a solid 8 or 9. I could watch it forever.,Mad Max
314,thedukeofwales,Great reminder of what you can do on a small budget.,8,26 January 2002,"Having a low budget didn't stop George Miller competing with Hollywood action cinema with this groundbreaking piece of apocalyptic sci-fi which also spawned two even more ambitious sequel's as well as countless rip off's. Despite the crude production values, the lack of money give's the film it's edge which most American action film's (even to this day)don't have.

315,mvtropicalia,Best low budget action film ever made,9,1 July 2014,"Mad Max may be the best low budget action film ever made. Story is very simple revenge story and used in various modifications countless times before and since, but it was executed with genuine flair and raw innovation. So many great elements: iconic car(s), unforgettable villains, unbelievable stunts, perfect casting (tough, shirtless, bald-headed police chief named Fifi). Every shortcoming of a shoestring budget was escaped by maverick use of editing and brilliant music. Unlike mainstream action movies, nothing is overblown, falsely sentimental or unnecessarily prolonged. Less is more, everything is raw, fast and furious (pun intended). Sense of decaying society on the edge of apocalypse is in the air without ever being explicitly referenced. Characters are straight out of comic books, but so much life is breathed into them by actors. As I've said, I've seen this kind of story zillion time, but is usually superficial and fails to feel real and really get to you, but my heart gets broken in this one every time in the movie's most tragic scene. It must go to credit of Joanne Samuel who was great in the role of lovable wife and Miller who managed to create action (anti)hero of flesh and blood. And also to Mel Gibson, he is burning on the screen in this movie.Miller & co. managed to top it with The Road Warrior, but the original stands its own ground as a true classic.",Mad Max

Although well done, and it seems Gibson may have done his own character, the dubbing occasionally throws up a Bronx-like accent and the whole thing sounds loud like a spaghetti western or cheap horror film. I don't know if this has always been the case in British releases, but until now i've had the trilogy on recorded tape from the t.v.

I admit it would have been cooler if they had the extra cash to put in the extra car chase scenes they wanted to, but thems the breaks. For me it's stood the test of time ***SPOILER*** just to watch Big Bopper crash into that van and start back up and burn those wheels, or when Max goes to get his revenge, or when Max gets his knee shot out and gets up and limps himself back into his supercharged black 74 XB GT hard top Falcon to give a great chase.

322,glasshouse1,"Mad Max - bloody, violent - a load of fun",8,26 April 2006,"One of the best revenge films ever made, imho. Wild and woolly rural Australia ruled by free-range biker gangs barely kept in check by a woefully understaffed police force - Main Force Patrol.This film appears to the casual viewer as merely a bunch of car chases and horrifying deaths strung together by scenes of poorly edited dialogue - particularly those that have only seen the 'Americanized' dubbing of the original Australian dialogue track.While the car chases are impressive (not quite so much as the 'Road Warrior/Mad Max II) in and of themselves, and the deaths in the film are pretty gruesome in most cases, it's the psychology of the characters in the film that strikes me. The deviance of the motorcycle gangsters, the passivity of the townspeople they meet, the blind-eyed amorality of the mechanic and the unrestrained hedonism of Goose (Max's best friend) all are worthy of study. More developed and glaring is the tired resignation of most of the members of MFP - for the most part a group of burnt-out, overworked cops that have had all sense of idealism stripped from them in a crucible of bureaucracy, judicial corruption and wide-spread anarchy they have no power to control.In the midst of this mess is Max - something of a knight-errant surrounded by chaos, trying to keep his integrity and character intact while trying to shield his family from the awful truth of his day-to-day worklife. Early in the film a glimpse is seen of what he fears most - that he himself is little better than the scum he battles daily. It is my opinion that makes his later descent to their level truly tragic.I truly recommend this film, particularly if you can watch it with the original Australian soundtrack. For some reason, the version released and most commonly seen in the US was overdubbed with American actors' voices. While the meat of the picture is present in this version, I feel it warrants, at best, a 6 of 10 rating. However, the original version, with Mel Gibson and the rest of casts' own voices is definitely a cut above. The added layers of subtlety in this version makes it almost like watching a completely different film, hence the 8 or 10 rating given above. If possible, watch it multiple times. I've seen it nearly 20 times, including both versions, and still find something new with every viewing.",Mad Max

It really is not a great start for a trilogy but Mad Max 2 is great. And the whole thing is a lot of fun. I feel that movies like this are extremely important in days like this where oil predicts every move that we make.

324,johannchristian,Structural Desaster and Bad Setting,1,17 September 2019,"Except from Mel Gibson's performance and some fine action scenes considering the small budget, there is nothing good to be said about this film.I could've endured the silly score and the trashy editing if it were for a solid plot. However, after finishing the first car chase scene, that introduces the viewer to the world, the police force and Max, the film feels like a dragged out first act, the only things that ever happen are set up. The set up eventually culminates in a 15 minutes revenge story.In general, nothing flows organically in Mad Max. After the Bikers whose member has basically been killed by the police, come to town, things start to escalate, an officer even gets almost burned to death. But the conflict never intensifies, instead Max takes some weeks off his job, and the Bikers tumble across his wife coincidentally.The setting is almost as bad as the plot. Instead of a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by vicious criminals, this feels more like our regular world with a strange, incompetent amateur police force. And this is not about the budget. There's cost-free ways to tell the audience that public institutions are basically gone, that people mistrust each other, and criminals rule the roads. That's not what they did.In summary, not worth watching. A small budget is no excuse for bad storytelling.",Mad Max
325,xitnowhere,realistic vision of a world descending into chaos,10,26 June 2006,"This film represents what i feel is one of the most realistic visions of the decline of society out of the many apocalyptic films made, the story centres around the almost hero like 'Max' and tells the story of the fight to maintain law and order in a world falling into chaos, the roads are being taken over by gangs and the small police force is being stretched to the limit trying to maintain order. Max and his fellow officers cause the accidental death of a member from a bike gang, who then come for revenge, his best friend is killed and ultimately they come for his family. The transition from family man and police officer to a shell of a man out for revenge with nothing to live is well very portrayed by both excellent acting on Mel Gibsons' part and very good writing.

Beyond the Thunderdome is still pretty amazing even today, and The Road Warrior is good and holds up fairly well even with its cheesiness. The original Mad Max is a complete waste of time. Long, boring sequences of people driving over backwater roads comprise about 70% of the movie. The ""revenge"" plot doesn't happen until 20 minutes before the end, as many have pointed out, and the ""apocalyptic future"" setting is something you'd never know from the movie itself - honestly anyone who says that is superimposing their memory of the later films over this one.Most of the film is trying to build up to the final payoff, but it just doesn't work with today's pacing and audience. There's no story otherwise and the action is laughable by current standards. I really have no idea why there are so many positive reviews, other than the movie was probably good for its time and it helped spawn a tremendous series which went on to influence many other great stories and media (the Fallout games, for example).

331,nwboothman,"Great action sequences, but the rest of it...?",6,18 July 2021,"Like many other much-loved action movies that have become staples of late-night TV, Mad Max isn't as good as you remember. Especially if viewed when sober and attentive, rather that just back from the pub.The version recently shown in the UK on ITV4 uses the original Australian dub of the soundtrack (I think), and it spoils large parts of the film. The music swerves from schmaltzy to bombastic, often drowning out the dialogue which is too low in the mix.Only half the cast can act, with Hugh Keays-Byrne nearly stealing the film as the Toecutter, while Joanne Samuel (Jessie) and Steve Bisley (Goose) are also very watchable. Mel Gibson works on an early version of his 'handsome crazy guy' routine that would serve him so well in the Lethal Weapon series.I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the best of the film's many action sequences is over and done with at the beginning. The car and bike stunts are spectacular but oddly scheduled through the movie - the climactic revenge taken by Max seems pretty low-octane compared with what's gone before.In the end it's a odd mixture: cheap horror-movie crash zooms, white-knuckle stunt work, gentle romantic sequences, homo-erotic leather gear. It put Australian movie making on the map, albeit briefly, and spawned many sequels, even if no-one's quite clear about where or when any of it is set: is this post-WW3, with society struggling to survive? Is it a dystopian near future? Is this just what the Northern Territories are pretty much like already?Don't think about it too hard. Just enjoy the stunts and the strangeness, ideally after an evening on the beers.",Mad Max

Not apocalyptic at all.",1,29 July 2021,"A movie marketed as apocolyptic, it's not, it's vops chasing people around in cars, when does the apocalypse start? I kept waiting for something to happen and it never does. Don't waste your Time.",Mad Max
333,NigeGSX1400,Inspiration to teen bikers in the UK,8,14 May 2002,"Personally I loved Mad Max. To me and more than a few of my friends who were into bikes back then (79 to 85) Mad max along with Quadrophenia made us feel like we were badguys (hey we were young). After watching Max and co young bikers across the UK attempted to emulate Max, Goose, Toecutter by being mean moody and more than a bit sad just as their predecessors had tried to emulate Marlon Brando (The Wild One) and Peter Fonda (Easy Rider) years before.The film although low budget is none the worse for that as it takes away some of the glitz that hollywood loves to throw into films and sometimes ruins by doing so (e.g. Thunderdsome Mad Max 3).The stunts are terific and the use of outback shots enhances the desolation the film seeks to portray. The acting is weak in some respects but the actors who portray 'the Goose' and 'the Toecutter' stand out even above Mel Gibson with performances that while believable are just the right side of over the top.The sound is excellent with good mood music work by Brian May. However in some places the speeded up driving and riding shots fail to work as well as they might. But in other areas the feel is just right e.g. Goose's ride out the morning after his night of passion with the nightclub singer.Overall a real groundbreaker which has rarely been beaten and which will still be remembered in years to come as a classic of Aussie cinema.",Mad Max
334,bigsissy,A prelude to the Mad Max franchise,4,4 August 2011,"Before I start this review, anything bad you may have heard or think of this movie shouldn't stop you from watching the other two Mad Max movies, except if you really hate violent movies. These are three different movies that can be seen in any order.That said, I'm not too thrilled by this first opus of Mad Max. If I hadn't seen and enjoyed Mad Max II before, I probably wouldn't have looked at this one twice. If it was only the abuse of gratuitous violence, I can stand it in a good story, but it feels like there is no story, no purpose to this mess. I just don't see the point of this movie : it's just violence over violence, and the characters don't seem to care for much any more.So for me the Mad Max franchise really starts with the second movie, this first one being a prelude easily forgotten.",Mad Max
335,grahamlparry,Beware the dark side,8,20 December 2004,"This is a good film which is frightening as it is still pertinent today. The basic story is one about revenge where the cop Max goes on the rampage following the abuse of his family by thugs. The engines roar loudly in a non-plastic fashion (don't like fast and furious) which is great fun. The final scene is a classic where he 'cuffs a chap to a car about to go up and gives him a hacksaw saying that he might survive if he cuts through his ankle rather than the metal. Great stuff. Shame mad max 4 never happened as the series is better than the lethal weapon one.My main reason for writing this is to clarify the period. Mad max one is in a pre-apocalypse (but increasingly fractious) society whereas 2 and 3 are post-apocalypse. The bomb went off after the credits of the first film and before the second. All confirmation of this can be seen in the opening preface to the second film Mad Max 2 : The Road Warrior, which, like the Empire Strikes Back, is one of the very few sequels which are better than the first film. These films are one of the best thing to come out of Oz.",Mad Max
336,Metaloide,compare it to movies of now..,9,4 June 2004,"This movies is one of my favorites because i like REAL action movies a lot.Here, you get a good view of the world max lives in: its hard, cruel and real.The car chases are the best ever. 2 fast and 2 furious are like cheap rip-offs of mad maxThe thing that continues true the three movies is that Max is like the lonely cowboy: he's singing a sad song and is/will be always aloneHail to you Max!",Mad Max
337,nikolasdrugo,Max Rockatansky the beginning of everything,7,2 February 2016,"A film that has inspired so many legends from escaping from New York via Waterworld, one of the most famous manga Hokuto no Ken and beyond. Are all films that are inspired by the genius of George Miller, The same film is one of the first stepping stones of Mel Gibson that here took its first steps into the world of cinema. A film with so many good ideas may not optimized for the limited budget available, a film reminiscent of the western genre in some respects, though too full of scenes that bring death to get bored enough, luckily poured from the middle starts to come out the true plot that keep us glued to the end, impossible to talk about without mentioning max Interceptor V8, the vehicle used by max for his revenge, entered the imagination of all and still Olympus of legendary vehicles of cinema. A film that does not have anything special except good ideas, but it has been able to enter the hearts of fans and was right in the history of cinema and its sequel, and especially with the last trasposzione Mad Max Fury Road.",Mad Max
338,rjwhe,Terrifying Look at a Possible Near Future,10,1 April 2005,"The film is thrilling, terrifying, and surreal. It sticks in the memory as unique and ground-breaking. I recommend the entire series. There is cinematography in the action sequences that you will see no where else. The editing is phenomenal. It has an insane edge to it that keeps you riveted. It is Mel Gibson's (normally a poor actor) best work, by far. Be forewarned, if you don't like violence in movies, stay away. The secondary characters are pulled from a warped imagination. They revolve around Max like carnival clowns, adding irony to the title. This vision of the future reveals humankind to be as frightening as any imagined alien. It has a ""Lord of the Flies"" anarchistic feel. It is one of my favorites for sure.",Mad Max
339,executor2,For Ford Falcon Fans,7,7 November 2004,"Excuse me my English. It seems, the film Mad Max can really like only the one who likes muscle cars of 60-70 years. I did not press in a detail, did not search flubs- the film simply has locked me from the very beginning, and when I have seen Black Interceptor, I simply became the film fan. Can, the plot is not so balanced, can, the characters are bad, but action, adrenaline, and the automobiles expiate all.By the way, I personally at once have believed that the action occurs in pre-apocalyptic world. PRE-. (POST- in Road Warrior.)",Mad Max
340,cameronstewart131,On the edge of OK.,6,12 May 2015,"Mad max wasn't as wild as I wanted it to be. There were eyeballs popping out of head and cheesy fireballs, but not much to really experience as a viewer. There were lots of shots of looking at things and feeling engines rev, but not much to the effect of actual endangerment in a constant flow.Through the whole movie I felt as though I was waiting for the action to happen in the next scene or the one after that. The action that did occur seemed to be too much a mix of reality and fantasy to only a negative effect. in the final crash, toe cutter was being followed and lost control and crashed. Reality says he gets distracted and crashes sending his guts flying, but the movie made his eyeballs pop and he went head on into a semi. This kind of action just doesn't attract my attention.The atmosphere of the whole movie was just bizarre and I think that I kind of liked that about it. Some parts seemed as though they were in total chaos with death being just a part of everyday life, while other places were clean and somewhat empty. If the world went into a wild chaos today, everything would be in ruin, but that slow descent into madness that is the Mad Max world leads those with control over themselves to keep their life in order while the crazies rule the road and some little areas. It represents who is sane in the world, those who go on the road lose the sanity the more they go out which is why the station is a mess, but the hospital is in order and functioning. This reflects on the current state of the world from the perspective of this film maker.Did I like it? EhI wasn't really engaged, but there were some entertaining parts. I like the engines and the motorcycles, so it wasn't too bad. It wasn't horrible, but not too far from that brink either. I'd say a 6, but you should watch it for yourself.",Mad Max
341,MrBenWhite,The Potential of the Australian Film Industry,7,8 April 2005,"Dr. George Miller's low budget Mad Max franchise impacted on Australian culture and altered the perception of Australia and Australians overseas in a way that no other Australian film had done. The films explores themes such as 'man and the environment', 'fear provoking post-apocalyptic future, family', 'masculinity in crisis', 'good versus evil (Max as an iconic hero), Australian ethos and car culture; themes often featured within Australian films yet presented in a stark and dramatic way. The cinematographic impact is powerful; the human and emotional appeal is timeless.Australia's barren deserts presented the ideal setting for a post-apocalyptic environment. The film set is more identifiable as Australia as it was filmed around the city of Melbourne. Long deserted roads feature significantly in the film and the cinematographic device of taking long distant shots of Max demonstrates how small he is in the scale of the environment that he is living. It is a relentless, unforgiving environment which demands defeat or survival and marks the characters which play upon its stage.Just as the physical setting is stark and desolate, the time setting and its associated events create an atmosphere of fear and foreboding which plays on the minds and emotions of contemporary viewers. In this fear provoking post apocalyptic future the few survivors of the nuclear holocaust are in warfare with one another, the rebel bikers and the police.Good versus evil is a dominant discourse in many film genres and one which embraces the Australian ethos. Max possesses some highly valued ""Australian"" traits; in particular, those of the underdog, the battler, the hero. External forces beyond his control stop him from ""winning"" completely. Contrary to the Hollywood hero, the Australian hero is a pawn in the game of others, which explains why Max can never quite ""win"" in absolute terms. There is little public glorification of success in Australia; heroes are remembered for their style rather than for their achievements. (Venkatasawmy, 1996) Mad Max represented a tradition hero, a hero to whom many diverse cultures are able to relate, as a story of a lone hero is a story that goes back through centuries of storytelling, and as a consequence the film achieved colossal success within Australian and around the world. The Australian cultures and lifestyles shown throughout these films give Australians an understanding of their country in the landscape, the language, and the way we treat people, life and life in exceptional circumstances.Reference Venkatasawmy, R.

342,sharyn64,Telford Jackson was my father.,8,16 May 2005,I really liked the first mad max movie. It was full of action and of course as my dad was in it i enjoyed it all the more. He only had a small part that of the tow truck driver that stops in at the road house but he use to always tell people if they'd blink they would miss him. I had no idea doing a search on the internet would find this wonderful site and bring back so many wonderful memories. My dad loved his acting and he was also a great singer and entertaining in general. If he wasn't acting he was singing or comparing. Mad max was a great movie. I recently bought it on DVD. So i guess you can guess the part i freeze the most :) Sincerely Sharyn Holt (nee Jackson),Mad Max
343,flieger85,Awesome Movie,8,8 June 2015,"A fun, terrifically staged and appropriately enthusiastically dystopian action film concerning a member of the police (Mel Gibson), feeling disillusioned from his work amidst a post-apocalyptic society, and how his young family is threatened by a ruthless biker gang after he is responsible for the death of their leader during a car chase. Director George Miller dresses this film up with no budget whatsoever amidst the beautifully desolate Australian landscape, with a star-making performance from Gibson as an everyday man character who is easy to root for given his situation. The movie takes a sudden turn near its conclusion that gives it a darkness I for one did not see coming, which in turn makes it a more memorable film instead of just a fun, though forgettable, action film. Instead this sudden change in tone makes it a film worthy of its cult classic status.",Mad Max

Anyone who give more than 5 to this has never seen good movies.*Spoilers ahead* It is just a cop who get wife and child killed and go for revenge. It does not take place in the future.It just has a catch in the ending because he makes of one the bad guys die like his partner but it is definitely NOT worth watching. Perhaps if it just had 20 minutes, it COULD be interesting since the action only happens in the last 10 minutes.Just don't watch it and thank me later for not wasting your time.

349,Stovaa,Holy crap.,1,6 August 2006,"I have been told by many people that this film was absolutely AWESOME. Those people were, evidently, very wrong. This film was a series of repetitive and nearly identical chase scenes strung together with lengthy dialogue scenes which served only to make me so tired I stopped caring about the film. However, I had just drunk a lot of cola so I wasn't quite asleep. The film spent 3/4 of it's duration introducing the characters and telling you how evil the baddies were. Then about 15 minutes in a chase which ends with the baby dying and his wife in hospital, apparently getting better. Then Mad Max went out to kick some ass, of the 8 bikers. Who had split up for no reason. Max killed 5 of them in one manoeuvre, which made the epitome chase scene a bit... less effective. Then he got tricked and attacked by magic bikers who appeared from nowhere and ran him over. Then he killed one of them and then the others rode off separately. However, this was no obstacle for him! He limped back to his car, chased down the leader and watched him crash into a lorry (complete with moronic eye-bulging effects) and then, in one of the movies better moments, blew up Johnny. Sadly, there was not enough time for the futility of his situation to sink in, just enough for Max to get in his car and drive away. END OF FILM.I just saved you 2 hours and £6. You're welcome.WORST. MOVIE. EVER.o",Mad Max
