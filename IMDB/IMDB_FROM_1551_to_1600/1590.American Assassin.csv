0,TheLittleSongbird,"Hits a few targets, never hits the bulls-eye",5,9 October 2017,"It is very easy to see where the mixed to negative critical reception for 'American Assassin' is coming from. At the same time, if there are people who got enjoyment out of 'American Assassin' that's more than fair enough. Have also been pleasantly surprised that so far those that liked the film have been reasonably civil towards those that didn't, which is very rarely the case for defenders of most critically panned films. Because to me, 'American Assassin' was far from a terrible film. It has a little better than expected, a little better than reputed and had its fair share of good points. It could have been far better though and never hits the bulls-eye, instead competently a few targets without living up fully to its potential. As an adaptation of the source material, it is an assassination with the only resemblances being the title and the characters' names. 'American Assassin' however is going to be judged by me on its own terms, as a standalone it's serviceable enough but is heavily problematic from personal opinion.'American Assassin' has good elements. It is a visually slick film, with atmospheric settings, brooding lighting and suitably gritty cinematography. The music doesn't make the mistake of being too intrusive or heavy in repetition. Some of the action excites and shocks and the direction is far from an amateur job, having touches of the bravura and some punch that should have come more consistently.The best things about 'American Assassin' are the first half an hour and the acting. The film opens with a startling and uncompromisingly violent opening sequence that leaves a positive and very promising first impression, while the first hour an hour is gritty and compelling as well as providing chills and devastation. The actors did a very good job with what they were given. Best of all was Michael Keaton on fantastically grizzled form, injecting much needed energy and punch.Dylan O'Brien is a very convincing lead, the character is too much of a hot-head at times who makes immature and rash decisions without thinking but O'Brien is charismatic and very committed to his role. Taylor Kitsch, who doesn't always do much for me, is surprisingly good in a type of role that one worries initially whether he has the charisma and menace to pull off but there is a noble and better-than-expected effort to rise above the material.On the other hand, other elements don't work. Mostly the film is good visually, but there is some jumpy, chaotic editing and while the special effects are wisely kept at minimum when they do appear one wishes that there weren't any at all because they are really not good, one doesn't expect them to look as cheap as they are for a feature film made on a sizeable budget.While the action mostly excites and shocks, others feel too rehearsed and polite when the film works so much better when unflinching and uncompromising which hurts the suspense and spontaneity. The direction as said is competent but the bravura and punch elements should have come more consistently and there is a lack of polish.It is the script and story that bring 'American Assassin' down most. The script (suffering from too many cooks spoil the broth, referring to the film's troubled script-writing history, more than one script-writer was involved here and it shows loud and clear) is cliché-ridden and is both pedestrian and hammy. As critics have said the film does lack wit and style due to the bland scripting and inconsistent tone and with such stiff and vast competition for spy/political/revenge thrillers (which 'American Assassin' doesn't do enough with) mostly little stands out. It also does nothing to make one properly care for the characters and never fully develops them, a lot of the side characters are very underwritten.'American Assassin's' story starts off so well and then goes off the boil and goes into tedious and over-the-top territories, never fully exploring the conflict and being indecisive on what its stance on whether revenge is a good or bad thing (it tries to do both and it ends up being confused). A good example of the over-the-top territory is when Keaton's character comments on and critiques his own torture, Keaton gives it everything and relishes the scene but the writing works against him, instead of being chilling like it could have been it comes over as very hammy and almost uncomfortably demented. While things do pick up in the climactic moments, some of it is overblown.Overall, not a must avoid by any stretch of the imagination but could have lived up to its potential so much more. 5/10 Bethany Cox",American Assassin
1,Leofwine_draca,A joy to watch,8,26 May 2018,"AMERICAN ASSASSIN is a BOURNE-style spy thriller made with a notably harder edge than most modern action thillers and their PG-13 certificates. It's a film based on a novel series centred around the character of Mitch App, a secret operative who travels around the world taking down terrorists and assorted bad guys. This plays out as almost a prequel, introducing us to an ordinary guy involved in an extraordinary event (the breathtaking opening sequence) who ends up undergoing gruelling training before going on the usual mission to retrieve stolen nukes. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. It's fast, hard-knuckle and action packed, and the fight scenes are really splendid. There's a lengthy training sequence lifted by the presence of the extraordinary Scott Adkins, while Dylan O'Brien is unrecognisable from his MAZE RUNNER young adult series. The film's real strength lies in the presence of Michael Keaton as the grizzled operative who bags all of the best lines. Keaton is really continuing his career resurgence here. Sure, there are problems, from the cliched plot devices to the bland villain and the digital look, but AMERICAN ASSASSIN remembers to focus on the twists, the turns, the suspense and the violence, and as such it's a real joy to watch.",American Assassin
2,SnoopyStyle,second tier action spy thriller,6,2 April 2018,"Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brien) proposes to his girlfriend on their beach vacation and then terrorists attack. Fueled by his anger at her death, he infiltrates the jihadist group seeking vengence. He is interrupted by U.S. Special Forces and CIA Deputy Director Irene Kennedy recruits him to be a CIA operative. He is sent to be trained and led by Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton). They are assigned to find loose nukes and they are confronted by opponent Ghost (Taylor Kitsch).This may have aspirations of being Tom Clancy or maybe more accurately going for a Jason Bourne vibe. It's not really achieving any of that. It has not enough realism and it's not necessarily fun. I do like dark Dylan O'Brien and some of the action. I don't know anything about the source material but it seems to me that Rapp's greatest asset is his expendability. There is deniability if the CIA keeps its distance. That's why at the beginning, I assumed that he would be a hired assassin in a dark ops with limited connection to the CIA. Instead, they try to incorporate him into a CIA team which is the worst of both worlds. He's restrained on one hand and on the other, he's a loose cannon for the CIA. He should be a lone wolf and the act of trying to tame him is flawed in both reality and storytelling. There are questionable motives by many of the characters if it stays long enough to explore them. In a world of action spy thrillers, this is a second tier entry and it fails to do anything special.",American Assassin
3,Horst_In_Translation,Don't expect Zero Dark Thirty and you can enjoy this one,6,27 November 2017,"""American Assassin"" (sounds a lot like American Sniper no?) is an American/Asian 110-minute movie from 2017, a recent release that a whole lot of writers (including the one who wrote the novel and died way too early) worked on and the director is Emmy winner Michael Cuesta, an experienced small and big screen filmmaker. The main character is played by the up-and-coming Dylan O'Brien, but the most known name is recent Oscar nominee Michael Keaton of course, who plays the main character's mentor in the military. The early events in this film are entirely without Keaton, but the fact that these may have been the very best thing about the movie doesn't mean that Keaton was bad or anything. Sure not every movie can be Batman, Birdman or Spotlight, but if you give this one the right approach, then it is very much worth seeing. Don't expect one of the defining films about terrorism from the last 10 years or 100% gritty realism and you could end up enjoying this one more than you expected. It gets a little weaker the longer it goes and honestly the part about the rivalry between Keaton's new kid vs. his old kid was pretty underwhelming. The main antagonist wasn't good enough I guess, but that may also have had to do with his material. The earlier antagonist was more memorable and the training sequences before that were fine too. As for O'Brien, I am a bit undecided what to think of his performance. The acting wasn't bad, but the over-the-top heroic actions close to perfection were a bit much for me at times. And somehow he did not look physically right for the role. The badass element was missing entirely. But at least Keaton brought it and it is close to his movie like I expected. Turned into quite a fan of him in recent years.Now I would like to give the film another mention for its really strong opening. The events at the beach that result in his decision to join the forces were on a level that I would consider among the finest, most thrilling sequences of the film year 2017. As much as the script may have disappointed on some occasions I mentioned earlier, I think it also made some good decisions like not including a romance part that could have diminished the opening and also there was a scene when we see the commanders of enemy nations talk like old buddies while their soldiers are battling it out the bloodiest way imaginable. So there were certainly several good, maybe even great, moments and wagering these against occasional weaknesses, this film is definitely still meeting in the middle on a level where I give it a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out. The ending offers the opportunity for a sequel, but I am not sure if the critical (yeah right, as if that matters) and commercial reception are good enough for them to follow up on this original. We'll see. I'd watch it probably as I liked this one here.",American Assassin
4,Prismark10,Not too memorable,3,24 November 2017,"Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brien) is on holiday in the Mediterranean with his girlfriend when terrorists attack and kills her.Hell bent on revenge he infiltrates a jihadi cell to get revenge and then gets recruited by a CIA counter espionage unit.Rapp gets trained by veteran agent Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton) who gets exasperated by Rapp's inability to follow orders. When some uranium goes missing Rapp and the team needs to retrieve it but Hurley comes face to face with a protégé known as the ghost.Dylan O'Brien was unconvincing as the grad student turned ace assassin with minimal training. I was shocked someone like him could even get anywhere near a jihadi cell. Taylor Kitsch who appears later on in the film might had been better cast as Rapp.The editing in this film was choppy, some of the CGI was rather average, the script was mundane and messy. The film was badly directed, even the foreign set scenes seemed wasted.",American Assassin
5,nogodnomasters,Off the Charts,8,23 September 2017,"Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brien) becomes a rogue assassin going after terrorist cells following the murder of his girlfriend. His ability does not go unnoticed and he gets recruited by the CIA. His scores were ""off the chart."" Mitch is someone who is a little bit ""off the chain."" He is trained by Birdman...or is it Batman (Michael Keaton as Stan Hurley) who is also tough as nails. They go on a mission to recover 15 Kg of bomb grade Pu-239.The characters and plot were fine. The characters initially come off as a miscast and it takes a while for them to grow on you. While the production falls short of spectacular, it has the bells and whistles to be popcorn entertaining.Guide: Swearing. No sex or nudity.",American Assassin
6,kosmasp,Training Ground,6,24 March 2018,"Michael Keaton is always great to watch. Even when he is just the mentor. Or maybe even more so. He has charisma and he can elevate any movie, as is the case right here. I'm not saying that our main guy here has no charisma. But compared to Michael, there is something lacking. Which makes this nothing more than a glossy B-Action movie, of which you have watched quite a few (I know I have).Having said all that, there is some decent action scenes in this. The story may be cliched as such, but it is secure when it comes to stunts. Which are not too crazy, but the budget allows things that other movies may not have access to. If you don't mind the flaws this has, you will be more than entertained.",American Assassin
7,classicsoncall,"""Never, ever let it get personal.""",7,31 August 2018,"""American Assassin"" was based on the novel of the same name by author Vince Flynn, the first in a now rather lengthy series. The story introduced the character of Mitchell Rapp, someone I first read about in the second book of the series titled ""Kill Shot"". In the couple of books I've read at this point, Mitch Rapp comes across somewhat older and wiser than the actor who portrayed him in this picture, Dylan O'Brien. O'Brien did seem much too young to have accomplished all he did in the eighteen short months following the opening scene in which his fiancée was murdered during a terrorist attack. Seeking revenge, Rapp becomes an accomplished authority on Muslim ideology, along with having a startling command of the Persian language. Infiltrating a Muslim recruitment operation, Rapp manages to kill a leading terrorist that the American CIA has been unable to target with all of their limitless resources. If it all sounds just a little too fantastic to be credible, you're going to be right, but what the heck. Just settle back and follow the action as Rapp gets recruited by the Americans and uses his unconventional military skills to help the CIA uncover a major plot to take out the Sixth Fleet with a nuclear weapon. Oh boy, the more I think about what I've just written, it sounds more and more unconvincing as a story. The topper occurs when Rapp ferrets out an Iranian double agent within his ranks and nearly drowns Annika Ogden (Shiva Negar) to get her admission, but in a stunning reversal, they become allies when her own handler is murdered by Iranian government bigwigs. You know, there may be something to all the negative reviews on this board, but I actually liked the picture while I was watching it. The cliché ridden theme of an agent going rogue in order to fulfill an original mission is encountered time and time again in the story with no foreseeable consequences. But I thought Michael Keaton was exceptional in his role as the hard nosed former Marine who headed up Orion, the CIA's elite secret unit, and responsible for Mitchell Rapp's training. Taken with sufficient grains of salt one could have some fun with this action flick, knowing that it's all just a bit over the top and with no connection to real life espionage or counter terrorism. Maybe throw some pepper in there too.",American Assassin
8,zardoz-13,Too Derivative 2 Be Memorable!!!,7,2 October 2017,"You'd think with gifted writers like Stephen Schiff, who wrote ""True Crime"" and ""Lolita,"" Michael Finch who penned ""Hitman: Agent 47"" and ""The November Man,"" and Edward Zwick & Marshall Herskovitz who teamed up for ""Defiance"" and ""The Last Samurai,"" that ""American Assassin,"" with ""Maze Runner"" star Dylan O'Brien, would have rivaled the James Bond movies and the Jason Bourne franchise as an international terrorist thriller. Indeed, a sturdy cast gives their best, particularly Michael Keaton who radiates throughout, while the youthful O'Brien has grown up sufficiently so he appears credible as a vengeful adult. Nevertheless, mediocre scripting sabotages ""American Assassin."" The chief problem lies with its bland hero. Cinematic heroes must stand out. As the gung-ho, 'go-out-and-kill-all-terrorists-and-come-back-alive,' O'Brien is given little with which to forge a charismatic character. Basically, Mitch Rapp qualifies as an adequate but nondescript hero. The only reason we feel sympathetic toward him is the tragedy involving his fiancée's death; this incident now fuels his every waking moment. Conversely, as CIA survivalist specialist Stan Hurley who trains black ops agents, Michael Keaton energizes every scene with his brazen bravado. You have fun watching Keaton dominate every scene whether he is shooting at an enemy or withstanding the villain as the latter tortures him. Similarly, as the treacherous villain, Taylor Kitsch is almost as captivating as Keaton. Furthermore, he is the best kind of villain who manages to stay one step ahead of the heroes and keeps surprising us and them. Adversaries like Keaton's trainer and Kitsch's terrorist make O'Brien's Mitch Rapp look like dreary. Happily, ""Kill the Messenger"" director Michael Cuesta keeps things moving so swiftly that it is possible to overlook the colorless but driven hero. Little of the high stakes plot, however, registers as original. ""American Assassin"" appropriates characters and predicaments from earlier movies, specifically ""Black Sunday"" (1977) ""The Amateur"" (1981), ""The Peacemaker"" (1997), and ""Munich"" (2005) where the villains have nuclear warheads.Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brien) is vacationing in sunny Ibiza, Spain, with his beautiful, blonde, bikini-clad girlfriend, Katrina (newcomer Charlotte Vega), when he surprises her with a marriage proposal. Suddenly, murderous Islamist jihadists shatter their happiness and shoot everybody in sight. The terrorists wound Mitch twice, and by the time that he reaches his fiancée, she is dead. Over a year later, Mitch has learned to defend himself with his bare hands, practiced enough with firearms until he can obliterate bullseyes, and learned enough about his Middle-East adversaries so he can infiltrate their cells. Little does our hero know CIA Deputy Director Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan of ""Love & Basketball"") has had him under surveillance. Eventually, Mitch tracks down the monster who orchestrated the bloody Ibiza beach massacre, Adnan Al-Mansur (Shahid Ahmed of ""Syriana""), to Tripoli, Libya. Mitch has just confronted Al-Mansur when CIA agents barge into the room and blast him. Mitch watches in horror as Mansur dies from a bullet in the head. This doesn't keep Mitch from stabbing Al-Mansur's corpse repeatedly until the Americans drag him off the body.The CIA keeps Mitch on ice for 30 days until Kennedy convinces CIA Director Thomas Stansfield (David Suchet of ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"") to allow him to join the Agency. Initially, Cold War veteran and former Navy Seal veteran Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton of ""The Founder"") abhors the prospect of training a civilian. Nevertheless, Mitch ranks at the top of his class, despite all of Hurley's dirty tricks to run him off. The action comes to boil when the Agency learns about the theft of weapons grade plutonium from an off-line Russian nuclear facility. Worse, Hurley recognizes the thief as an ex-CIA agent, referred to as Ghost (Taylor Kitsch of ""John Carter of Mars""), left behind to die on a mission. Miraculously, Ghost survived and plans to use the plutonium to construct an atomic bomb. Ghost double-crosses everybody along the way who helped assemble the bomb, and the CIA don't discover his plan until it is almost too late to thwart him.If you've read Vince Flynn's bestseller, you'll know director Michael Cuesta and his writers have scrapped the novel's plot. Indeed, they have preserved certain scenes, primarily the boot camp and the torture scenes. The plot about Stan's former student Ghost is a figment entirely of the screenwriters' imagination. Ghost doesn't exist in the novel. Instead of a saboteur like Ghost, our heroes in the novel contend with Middle Eastern regimes clashing with each other in bombed-out Beirut. While an entirely different character tortured Stan in the novel, the villain suffers the same fate as Ghost does in the movie. Letting down his guard momentarily, the torturer gives Stan the chance to chew off a piece of his ear. Comparably, Flynn dispatched Rapp and Hurley to Europe to kill an amoral banker who had been investing millions of dollars for the terrorists as well as Russian espionage agents in Moscow. Furthermore, Mitch's girlfriend didn't die on the beach in Flynn's novel. Instead, she died aboard the doomed Pan Am flight 103 that blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland. Mind you, sticking Mitch and his fiancée together on the same beach gives our protagonist greater incentive to embark on a ""Death Wish"" style revenge spree since he witnessed her death. Obviously, staging the beach massacre was easier than generating a CGI model of the Pan Am jetliner exploding. In Flynn's novel, Mitch didn't experience his girlfriend's death first-hand as his cinematic counterpart. Most of the last part of the novel occurred in Beirut where terrorists abducted Stan, and Mitch launched a rescue mission. The grand finale in the film occurs in the Atlantic, and Ghost is playing for far higher stakes than his villainous counterparts in the novel. Altogether, Schiff, Finch, Zwick, and Herskovitz have done an exemplary job of ramping up the action, and Mitch displays greater initiative in his efforts to complete his mission. Although competent and fast-paced, ""American Assassin"" is still far too derivative to be memorable.",American Assassin
9,george.schmidt,Keaton is the only noteworthy point to a pointlessly dull counter-terrorist action flick,2,16 September 2017,"American ASSASSIN (2017) *1/2 Michael Keaton, Dylan O'Brien, Sanaa Lathan, Shiva Negar, David Suchet, Scott Adkins, Taylor Kitsch. Boring counterterrorist action flick based on Vince Flynn's novel about a young recruit for the CIA (lackluster blank as a fart O'Brien) whose personal tragedy is his incentive for payback and vengeance when he is the unlikely new team member to infiltrate a possible worldwide threat and under the wing of veteran Keaton (who does as best as he can with the yawn-worthy material). Michael Cuesta's direction fails to muster an iota of real interest with his epic fail of his young lead to carry favor with its audience and the biggest shock is the dull screenplay by Stephen Shciff and Michael Finch was co-written by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz - the powerhouse '80s filmmaking team who have seen better days and better projects!",American Assassin
10,neil-476,Indifferent time passer with an indifferent leading man,6,8 May 2018,"Following the loss of his girlfriend in a terrorist attack, ex-Navy Seal Mitch Rapp joins the CIA anti-terrorist squad but proves to be unable to follow orders as the theft of nuclear material by a middle-eastern terrorist cell proves to be a pressing problem.Based on material from a series of novels featuring Rapp, this is a tolerable action thriller with a moderate amount of plot. In particular, who is on who's side?The action scenes work reasonably well, the plot rolls along nicely, and the supporting cast all do well, especially Michael Keaton as Rapp's immediate superior.The problem here is Dylan O'Brien as Rapp. He's a nice looking lad, in the mode of Mark Wahlberg, and he acquits himself well in the action scenes. The problems - there are two of them - are that he can't act and he doesn't command the screen. The whole point is that he is driven by revenge, but you never feel any variation in his slightly miffed expression. He comes across as a bit annoyed all the time, and never sad, angry, distraught, or any of the many other emotions he should be displaying. And he's light on charisma. Maybe in a few years he'll be there, but I can't help comparing him with a young Tom Cruise - or, indeed, Wahlberg. When they started, neither was regarded as anything like the actors they have turned out to be, yet both of them were undoubtedly stars right from their early days. This is not the case with O'Brien.This is an adequate time passer, with Keaton being better than the film he is in.",American Assassin
11,phd_travel,Good beginning and ending but falters in the middle,7,20 October 2017,With all the terrorism in Europe nowadays the story of a guy taking out terrorists has a relevant and feel good revenge fantasy feel about it. This movie starts off strong with a painfully plausible beach shooting in Spain. After our hero's girlfriend is killed he take it upon himself to take out jihadis. The CIA take him under their wing and he gets a trainer. Things are quite exciting with interesting locations in Istanbul and Rome. But in Rome the story involving Iran and plutonium and a rogue agent gets a bit silly formula and convoluted so it feels fake. The setting for the climax is quite different so it saved the movie.Dylan O'Brien is surprisingly good as the unlikely action hero. He is someone who isn't a typical overly pumped up action hero type and it makes a refreshing change and more believable. He actually looks quite convincing with a beard. Taylor Kitsch seems to be in lots of movies in supporting roles. He plays the rogue agent but his grievance seems flimsy. Strangely they made him dress and look too similar to Dylan so it was confusing sometimes. Michael Keaton seems okay at first - anyone is better than Bruce Willis these days. But during a rather unintentionally funny torture scene Michael turns kind of Beetlejuice.For low mentality fun it's alright. A Luc Besson touch would have helped.,American Assassin
12,trashgang,first big movie with Dylan O'Brien,7,21 December 2017,"I've seen Dylan o'Brien grown all over the years. First time was in Teen Wolf were he was able to act the main lead away and taking over the whole serie. Which resulted in The Maze Runner (2014) franchise, not bad but still made for the teenaged girls out there. But now that Teen Wolf is over he makes a big step into the Hollywood flicks.

14,siderite,A mediocre and propagandistic secret agents film,7,11 August 2020,"I think the greatest success of the film was the casting. Dylan O'Brien looks like the younger brother of Taylor Kitsch and landing Michael Keaton was a great accomplishment for a movie this banal. Other than that, the same old cliches of the temerarious young recruit who is good at everything and puts his heart where his mouth is, the hardcore American secret agent who is orders of magnitude better than any other secret agent, the righteous cause of the American (secret squad of trained killers with no oversight) and the happy ending where good defeats the evil and, do not forget, the evil Iranians and the necessary need to kill as many of them as possible.The action was good, even if stretching the suspension of disbelief, the acting was good, but the script was really mediocre. Everything is done by the numbers and there is nothing that separates this film from any other of the genre from the last 30 years or more.

15,Hellmant,I definitely have no problems with Dylan O'Brien or the rest of the cast.,7,20 September 2017,"'AMERICAN ASSASSIN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new spy thriller based on author Vince Flynn's 2010 novel (of the same name), which is part of a popular spy book series. It stars Dylan O'Brien as a 23-year-old that obsessively wants revenge for the death of his girlfriend, in a terrorist attack, and is recruited by the CIA (as part of their black ops program). He's trained by a Cold War veteran played by Michael Keaton. The movie also costars Taylor Kitsch, Shiva Negar and Sanna Lathan. It was directed by Michael Cuesta (who also helmed 2014's 'KILL THE MESSNEGER') and it was written by Stephen Schiff, Michael Finch, Marshall Herskovitz and director Edward Zwick (who was originally set to direct the film as well). It's gotten mixed reviews from critics, and it's also a mild hit at the Box Office as well. The film starts out promising, but later it becomes pretty routine and forgettable. Mitch Rapp (O'Brien) lost his parents in a car crash when he was 14. At 23 he's just found happiness again, after proposing to his girlfriend on a beach (and she accepts), but then his new fiancé is murdered in a terrorist attack in front of him (at that same moment). Rapp desperately wants revenge, and he obsessively trains (and plans) for it. The CIA becomes worried about his mental well being though, after tracking him, but instead of detaining Rapp, they recruit him. He's then trained by a Cold War veteran, named Stan Hurley (Keaton), and his first mission is to stop an old trainee of Hurley's (Kitsch), who's a lot like Rapp, from starting another world war in the Middle East. The opening scene of the movie is really intense, violent and engaging. After that, the origin story of Mitch Rapp is still pretty cool and involving, but then (about half way through the film) it starts to feel really routine and somewhat boring. The action scenes are all still decent, throughout the film, but the story just loses your interest. Still, it could be a decent setup for a spy movie franchise (like they're hoping it is), and I definitely have no problems with Dylan O'Brien or the rest of the cast.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/234520321",American Assassin

17,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Generic, by the numbers thriller with nothing new to say",4,13 February 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMitch Rapp (Dylan O' Brien) is a young American, who decides to propose to his girlfriend at a beachside holiday resort, only for his happiness to be brutally and tragically cut short when armed terrorists storm the place and randomly kill various people, including his love. Consumed with rage and anger, he comes to the attention of CIA bigwig Irene kennedy (Sanaa Lathan), who decides he would have the perfect attributes to be a great operative, but to channel his aggression properly, she sends him to be trained by renowned agent Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton.) Rapp is put to the test when he is partnered with Iranian agent Annika (Shiva Negar) after a large amount of plutonium is stolen in Russia to be used for a terrorist attack in America.The phenomenon, and certainly the threat, of armed terrorists storming unsecured beachside resorts and taking innocent casualties is certainly one that's very relevant and timely at the moment, especially with real life incidents in places such as Tunisia, and so there's certainly potential to be had with American Assassin. Sadly, director Michael Cuesta has produced something utterly bland and formulaic, that offers no surprises or anything in the way of something you haven't seen many times before, usually arriving straight to DVD and starring Steven Seagal.The film just fails to really evolve into anything truly inspiring or new, not really holding your attention for the whole two hours, despite having such a promising story torn from today's headlines which it has nothing interesting to say on. With nothing to offer in terms of originality, it descends into ridiculousness, becoming the type of film where a shoot out can be taking place in a hotel room, and nobody pokes their heads out of theirs to see what's going on, much less try and run away. There are one or two decent action sequences, especially towards the end, but they're too few and far between to really hold sway.Performances wise, O' Brien is credible and has presence in the lead role, but he does nothing anybody else couldn't have done. All eyes, unsurprisingly, are on comeback kid Keaton, in a typically zany supporting role, and, even more unsurprisingly, stealing the show. Indeed he, out of all of them, really makes you wonder what he had in mind. **",American Assassin

Its story occasionally becomes so silly - with Keaton spouting hammy dialogue and loving it, to the point where his response to a brutal torture technique actually made me chuckle instead of cringe - and relies on such clichéd, over-the-top plot-points that you'd almost think it's trying to spoof the genre. It's at its best when it is brutal and borderline nasty, but unfortunately the callousness of the lead (which would've been a unique feature) has been toned down significantly from the novels which leaves him fairly generic and one-note with motivations that are conceptually clear but personally questionable. Though the rote rigamarole is competent and can be occasionally enjoyable, it is disappointing that the harsher elements of the piece are not capitalised on considering the audience is already considerably more mature than than picture seems to realise. 5/10.",American Assassin
19,bowmanblue,Bourne TNG,6,22 October 2018,"I have to confess to not knowing that much about 'American Assassin's' roots, i.e. the series of books it was based on, and generally sat down to watch it due to it having Michael Keaton in it, following his cultural resurgence of late. Without knowing any more than the title hinted at, I was pretty much shocked right off the bat.It's actually quite a lot more violent than I was anticipating. There are some scenes that are scarily realistic and really do go a long way to convey the sense of terror the victims must be experiencing (and this is just in the opening ten minutes!). A young man loses a loved one in a terrorist attack and sets about seeking revenge on the group responsible. Only, somewhere along the way, the CIA decides to recruit him for a more 'traditional' method at dealing with the 'bad guys.'I found I had mixed feelings about the film. The opening is certainly not for the faint-hearted and I thought I was in for one hell of an 'adult ride.' However, it kind of slows down after that and descends into one suspension of disbelief after the next. I could sort of buy that the most organised espionage agency in the world would feel the need to recruit a completely 'self-taught' protégé, but the fact that he quickly becomes more trusted and powerful than the entire organisation put together seemed a little too much. I felt you had to take so much of the story with a pinch of salt that only cinema-goers who weren't really familiar with the genre could believe what they were seeing, i.e. teens.However, just when I was settled into the mindset that I was destined to spend the next couple of hours watching 'Jason Bourne for the next generation,' that initial violence cropped up again and I was left wondering who this whole film was aimed at.Overall, it's not a bad film if you're into yet another spy vs terrorist movie. There's action, the young star will probably go a long way and Michael Keaton was as good as I expected in the grizzled CIA trainer responsible for turning our young protagonist into the best killing machine in the West. I think I need to watch it again and put my mind completely 'on hold' to begin with - that way I can completely overlook the fact that the head of the CIA keeps putting this untrained kid back on missions despite him 'going rogue' on almost every one.",American Assassin

21,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,21 November 2017,"American AssassinThe trouble with millennial assassins is that they take too many selfies with their dead target afterwards.Luckily, the rookie in this action-thriller had a traumatic experience with a camera.After filming his fiancée's death at the hands of jihadists, Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brien) studies Islam in order to infiltrate their cell and extract revenge. However, the CIA has been monitoring Rapp's online activities and has now recruited him.Trained by a gruff ex-Navy SEAL (Michael Keaton), Rapp is sent into the field to stop a former agent (Taylor Kitsch) from selling a nuclear weapon to terrorists.Mitch Rapp's first foray into films, this stylish adaptation of the popular book series is a misstep for the fledging franchise. While the performances are solid, the turncoat agent storyline is standard cloak and dagger stuff. Moreover, it must be hard to win a war when your citizens keep joining the other side.

22,tabuno,A Decent if Not Specular Retread,7,9 January 2019,"15 September 2017. American Assassin offers up one wallop of an explosive climax along with a less than a copy of another Jonathan Demme and Anthony Hopkins final scene. By the time of this explosive climax has been delivered, this movie for the most part using an energizing soundtrack covers the unoriginal tortured soul turned assassin espionage plot that covers the usual territory along with several twists one political the other personal that don't seem to either break the mold or doesn't quite achieve the expected emotional or poignant impact. Annika, the mysterious female agent, came across as too emotional and wasn't convincing especially as an experienced operative which makes her role in the movie less than satisfying. This is no classic Fail Safe (1964) geo-political thriller nor Casino Royale (2009) heart wringer. Even the main character played by Dylan O'Brien as Mitch Rapp isn't the most agreeable nor likable character, it's as if he goes around with a dark cloud throughout the movie. While his mentor, Michael Keaton does a credible job, there are more hand-wringing and exciting moments in many of the episodes of the television hit series The Black List (2013- ). The physical action is decent with its own distinctive style. What is intriguingly missing here is the directorial direction of trying to incorporate a more straight-forward approach with this script with no psycho-babble personal history component. If the director had just allowed this movie to have dealt with a more authentic professional espionage package like the classic The Ipcress File (1965), Tinker, Tailor, Solder Spy (1979) or The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965) or even Russia House (1990), this movie might have been a contemporary espionage classic. Instead this movie provides more of a retread of similar or better movies such as Wanted (2008), The Recruit (2003), La Femme Nikita (1990), Point of No Return (1993), or Spy Game (2001).",American Assassin
23,The-Sarkologist,Another tired & Worn out spy movie,3,25 September 2017,"This is one of those films that as soon as the camera started rolling I asked myself what on Earth possessed me to purchase a ticket to it because it became pretty obvious pretty quickly that it was going to be substandard. I guess it had something to do with it being about assassins, but as soon as we learn that the protagonists seem like they are going to be Muslim extremists I simply cry out 'next please' and tune out. Well, as it turned out it wasn't as bad as that, but considering the quality of some of the other films that I have seen this one really didn't hit the mark.Basically it is about this guy who watches his girlfriend get shot when Islamic extremists attack a beach in Ibiza. He then decides to become a vigilante so as to basically hunt down and kill as many terrorists as possible. He partially succeeds, but the CIA end up intervening and rescuing him namely because, despite all of his training, he is still well out of his depth. Instead they decide to send him to become a part of a top secret black ops team.The film seems to spend a bit of time setting the scene before it actually gets to the meat of the action. Then again it is pretty ambitious in its scope, building the character, introducing him to the CIA, and then having him go through some training before sending him off onto the main mission. It is probably better they did it that way because a lot of similar movies spend a lot of time on the training aspect and simply rush through the mission at the end, whereas this film does spend quite a decent amount of time on the mission.Still, that doesn't necessarily mean that it is a good film, but then again having seen some incredible films recently, it is pretty difficult for this one to be able to pass the bar. While they eventually moved away from the well worn and tired Islamic extremist antagonist, it still felt that this film was a little tired and worn. Personally, I don't necessarily want to go too deep into the characterisation, but in a way I guess the fact that it was a little too close to home made me feel that this film lacks where a lot of other, much better films, succeed. Our protagonist, the brash youngster who has a lot of trouble following orders is also a pretty tired and worn out protagonist.It is interesting to see Michael Keaton making a bit of a comeback, but I guess starring in a movie that won four academy awards, and having a nomination to his name does a lot for one's career. It does seem as if for quite a while he had pretty much vanished, and all of a suddenly we see him appearing in a number of films. However, while he was okay, I guess in the end it is the quality of the film as opposed to the skill of the actor that in the end makes a movie, and this one really didn't hit the spot for me.",American Assassin

25,cruise01,Plenty of action and thrills to keep you entertained in a espionage thriller.,9,15 September 2017,"American Assassin is an action packed esponiage thriller that never slows down and even shows that Dylan O'Brien can take on a stone cold killer role. I was very impressed with the movie. Mitch (Dylan O'Brien) was on a Mediterranean trip with his girlfriend, which he proposes on the beach. Until, a group of terrorists attack on the beach by shooting at every civilian they see. Mitch witnesses his girlfriend getting killed in the attack. A year or so later, Mitch highly trained himself to go on a vengeance after the terrorists that killed his girlfriend. He trained himself through MMA classes until he gets kicked out for being brutal to the other opponent. He is skilled with weaponry at a shoot range until he loses it and walks into the shooting range. And he has a lead to the terrorists responsible. Only to be followed and captured by the CIA. Who tends to recruit him led by Stan (Michael Keaton). While they are on a mission trail in hunting a terrorist that has stolen nuclear material which traces back to a rogue agent named Ghost (Taylor Kitsch). Mitch will stop at nothing to eliminate the threat even if it requires him to disobey his orders. American Assassin is that type of action film that entertains with putting the main character into a revengeful path. It may not be a memorable plot or worth mentioning. But it is exciting to see a gritty, brutal Dylan O'Brien taking out bad guys. I wont be surprised if this will be his franchise just like there are other spy action movies like Bond or Jason Bourne. The action sequences are brutal; the fight scenes are quick and gritty. Mitch Rapp never holding back in letting a bad guy escape. It is fun to see Dylan O'Brien going through several action set pieces in trying to stop the villain from setting off a nuclear bomb. Dylan O'Brien may have found his calling in an action franchise. I am glad he did instead of being stuck in the Teen Wolf series. And growing up to be a brute mean machine as a stone cold killer. He is good as an action star and as well as in the Maze Runner movies. Michael Keaton was also good as Mitch Rapp's trainer into the CIA. Sanaa Lathan was also good as Irene, who sees Mitch as a good potential in there team. Taylor Kitsch was good as the villain, who was once in the marines and went rogue against what he stood for. Like all else, the plot is forgettable. It is kind of an origin story with Mitch Rapp going on a brute path in finding bad guys on his own until he gets recruited. I am sure this plot has been done too many times in other spy action movies. Were the main hero goes in every set piece trying to track down were the bomb is. Or where the bad guy is. And the villain is a rogue agent. I am sure, there are some Jack Ryan movies that may have been similar. Overall, American Assassin is a really good film. There is plenty of shoot them up action and brutal fight sequences with Dylan O'Brien taking on an action hero role. It definitely is a great start to a franchise, if this was a success. Sure, the plot may have its flaws of being similar or nothing memorable. But it's just pure action packed entertainment. I rate the film 4.5 out of 5 stars.",American Assassin

The story as a whole is just confusing.Dylan O'Brien is a decent lead but wasn't completely convincing, and Michael Keaton was a more over the top annoying character.Seeing as this film is apart of a large book franchise it was obvious that they had intended on making this movie a franchise but from the look of its box office failure, we doubt that will happen.",American Assassin
27,TheMovieDiorama,"American Assassin is another generic ""kill the terrorists"" plot...but I really liked it.",7,27 February 2018,"Action thrillers are my strawberry jam (strawberry because it's red...like blood...urgh whatever). Whether it's Liam Neeson kicking ass or Bruce Willis yippee-kiyay-ing bad guys. I. Love. Action. Based off the novel, American Assassin revolves around Mitch who, after a terrorist incident, chooses to pursue and terminate every terrorist ever. But of course he must undergo some standard boot camp training, lead by the legend that is Michael Keaton. I have to get this off my chest: Dylan O'Brien is a beautiful creature. I want to look like I him, I want to smell him, I want to be him. He is, as with most protagonists, invincible. Shot through the chest? Just get back up again. Slice your hand on a blade (twice!)? Don't worry, just a paper cut. Run over by a luxurious vehicle? Well...where there is blame, there is a claim. I could tell O'Brien loved portraying Mitch. His passion was bursting through every scene and clearly likes doing his own stunts. Michael Keaton gets some action as well, and undergoes a vicious torture scene that involves fingernails. Taylor Kitsch is the antagonist, his performance was decent but the character was forgettable. Just a bland terrorist. Yes, the plot is also generic and we've seen it a billion times. What separates this from the rest is the precise execution and good editing (for the most part). I sat down and read 'American Assassin 18 rated'. ""What!?"" I thought to myself, then the opening scene happens and everything is justified. Exhilarating and horrifying simultaneously. Really well directed, nice one shot take. The last act gets slightly ridiculous but heck I was entertained. I was onboard. ""Yeah! America!"". Some nice twists as well to maintain the thrills. Also admired the fact they didn't force Mitch to have a love interest, would've diminished his purpose. Guys, I was expecting to hate this...I came out pumped.

He wrote about 15 books covering the adventures of his hero, Mitch Rapp, so this could be the beginning of a new franchise-it certainly ends as if there will be more. Dylan plays Mitch, a 23 year old man that looses his girlfriend to a senseless terrorist attack-they almost kill him, too.

His first black ops mission is to stop some very bad people from starting a nuclear war in the Middle East.

35,kirbylee70-599-526179,Move Over Jack Bauer,9,19 December 2017,"When transitioning a movie from book series to film you have an issue to contend with. Millions of readers have read the books and have created the image of the characters, especially the lead character, in their mind. There is no way possible that the perfect actor to portray that role is possible. But most of us can be forgiving and accept the choice if the movie is good. JACK REACHER was a great example where the 6 foot 5 inch tall Reacher was portrayed by the 5 foot 7 inch tall Tom Cruise. He made you forget and gave it his all. Such will be the case for Vince Flynn's character Mitch Rapp. Does this film do him justice? In a word yes.Mitch (Dylan O'Brien) is on a sunny vacation beach with his girlfriend who he's just proposed to. Going for drinks his world is turned upside down when terrorists hit the beach killing tourist, his fianc among them, shooting Mitch and leaving him for dead. Their mistake as 18 months later we find Mitch constantly training, learning martial arts, weaponry and turning himself into a killing machine.Mitch has also gone underground and located the men responsible for the terrorists attack. He's placed himself in their area and convinced them he wants to join. Taken to their hidden headquarters he is about to either be accepted or killed when several are shot through the windows, the door is breached and the rest are killed while Mitch is handcuffed and taken away.The CIA was responsible for taking Mitch away and killing the terrorist cell. Led by Deputy Director Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan) they'd been following Mitch's progress all along. She sees potential in turning Mitch into an agent and approaches him with the offer. Thinking this will help him in his quest to eliminate all terrorists, he takes her up on the offer.Taken to a secluded training facility in Virginia Mitch is introduced to Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton), an ex-Navy SEAL, cold war operative and tough old school spymaster and top trainer for the CIA. Stan has close ties to Irene having known her since she was a child but doesn't agree with her assessment of Mitch. He can tell that Mitch still clings to that concept of revenge making things personal, something he goes out of his way to tell Mitch to abandon before it controls him.As training progresses Hurley begins to see the potential in Mitch as well. At the same time while bucking the standard playbook presented to him with training, Mitch begins to feel this might be a group that he can become a part of. They continue to clash when a world shattering event happens and calls them into action.A free agent known only as The Ghost (Taylor Kitsch) has stolen raw plutonium that can be used for a dirty bomb. Working for a group of Iranian hardliners intent of using the bomb it attracts the attention of the CIA. Even more so the attention of Hurley who knows something about The Ghost. With his latest recruits in tow the team heads out to find the plutonium and take down this terrorist sympathizer. But is Mitch ready? Is there something personal about The Ghost that Hurley is taking to heart? And can the terrorists be stopped in time?The book series is one of the best written in some time. Fortunately before he passed away from cancer author Flynn was involved in this film project. That they were able to capture what was on the written page and put it on the screen is an achievement worth noting. So much so that fans, like myself, can only hope that the film was successful enough that more are in the works.In the books the character of Rapp was like a steroid injected version of 24's Jack Bauer, a man who believes in his mission and is willing to do anything to get the job accomplished, that job being to take on terrorists and protect his country. O'Brien's version here fits the mold perfectly. His determination and change from innocent to angel of vengeance to full on hero is a journey on display that adds depth to a character that could have come off as an un-costumed Batman clone. Mitch as seen here has emotions while at the same time being focused on the mission.Keaton shows why he can take on nearly any role sent his way. He bursts out of comedic roles in 1989 when he stunned non-believers in to proving he WAS Batman. Now he displays the world weary killing machine Stan Hurley so well that there is no doubt he IS this character. While book fans know his fate the door is left open for more training and more terrorists to be taken down. And while the character may be angry at times for Mitch not following orders he also recognizes that by taking initiative Mitch moves the game forward with his natural sense of events. In essence he sees himself in Mitch.The movie is action packed from the first moments on the beach till the potential cataclysmic ending, one that offers the special effects team the chance to create something never seen before. The movie offers a more realistic version of the spy world than the Bond movies we've grown up with, a gritty no holds barred world where innocents are slaughtered for simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. But the heroes it offers are just as realistic, men willing to step outside the lines to insure the safety of the world. One hopes that men like Mitch Rapp and Stan Hurley are actually out there. While we may never actually know at least we can find comfort in the stories of these characters both in written and filmed versions. When the credits roll you'll find yourself wondering when the next one will be made.",American Assassin

When Hurley meets with an Iranian government informant, the stranger, codename Ghost, shows up kills the Iranian and kidnaps Hurley. The CIA/Mossad won't do anything so that forces Rapp to go rogue together with an Iranian girl who was working with the team in order to save Hurley. In the process we learn who Ghost is and what his relationship with Hurley is as well as what his goal is. He too has his own plans that go beyond letting the Iranian radicals have a bomb.American Assassin is a thrilling movie that benefits from a strong, rich story that makes for a nearly 2 hour-long movie. Despite the length, the movie is filmed in a dynamic way and one ends up wishing they had spend more time covering how Rapp infiltrates the terrorist for instance. Or it would have fun to see more of Hurley's group undergoing training. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit; the politics behind it are also more developed. But visually this movie left something to be desired and the direction is also subpar at times.

Guy is welcomed back and made a real spy.This is a story made times and times again. It is a proven concept, the story holds together and provides some decent no-brain action. If you want to see some hand to hand combat, some shooting - both sniper type and close combat, sure this might be a movie to watch. But I bet you could tell the entire story one step ahead of itself...",American Assassin

I thought it might help since I was unfamiliar with the book series. I watched it alright but, as even a action movie I found it to be a generic Hollywood bombastic mess. A movie that wants to be a real action thriller falling sorely flat in spades. With Keaton I expected more. Something with a good story that was compelling maybe? It was quite the opposite. Save yourself the disappointment and watch something else.",American Assassin

43,robertemerald,Exciting slightly unusual big budget spy thriller,8,24 June 2019,"American Assassin is at least as enjoyable as a Bourne movie, if not with as much charm and gravitas in its lead players. It's a tight race against the clock for much of the second half. There are great stunts, unusual one-on-one battles, some good gunplay, and is definitely in the running for best explosion of the year. It's an intensely personal movie, an aspect that sets it slightly apart from contemporaries, and is more in league with movies such as The Hunter's Prayer or Erased for example. It has all the bells and whistles, dazzling international locations, a cracking pace, a whole heap of tension, big intrigue, twists and turns, pretty good tech, and just a smidge of patriotism of course. Great action film, easily recommended.",American Assassin
44,TheOneThatYouWanted,You know a movie bites when the extras are looking directly at the camera in the background,1,2 November 2017,"I scored free tickets to this which is a good thing because I walked out after an hour because I was dozing off. Before that, it was a struggle to stay awake or interested. This is just a super generic film we have seen a million times before but the worst thing is that the action isn't even good. Tons of jump cuts, shaky-cam and annoying close-ups. Plus this film is laughably directed. There is even one scene where two people are talking while eating outside of a cafe and this lady in the background just keeps looking at them as she walks by; I'm guessing this film went super cheap and just shot some scenes out in public without using extras as background people. This should have never gotten screen time, big or small. It is just lame.",American Assassin
45,rgkarim,Assassin Assessment,6,16 September 2017,"In a time of political warfare and strife, the world needs heroes to arise to help curb the actions tension may lead to. Movies being a great source advertisement for hero portrayal would certainly look to developing a political warrior, peacemaker, or some warrior of the word. Nope, that doesn't sell, so let's make another super-agent instead. Robbie K again, and today we review American Assassin, the action thriller of September starring Dylan O'Brien and Michael Keaton. Let's get started!LIKES:Immersive Presentation: One of the things I liked most with this movie how I felt integrated into the whole program that Mitch (O'Brien) is going through. From the horrific tragedy that send him down the vigilante pathway to the indoctrinating mission that sets his path, you'll get all the emotional rides that come with it. As Mitch evolves as a character, you too get entangled in the complex web of emotions, all while feeling like a spy thanks to the intertwining scenes of spy technology digging up dirt on the target. Pretty cool indeed. Fast Pace: I guess a quick pace is good when it comes to action films huh? American Assassin throws few roadblocks into the simple and linear plot it is based on. One will go from point A to Point F faster than a kid connecting the dots, with little to try and take your attention away. Editors get props for keeping the tangent story lines at a minimum and keeping them relevant to bring you more thrills, spills, and kills. Acting: With Keaton's resurgence back into Hollywood these last few years, you hope he brings some magic to the screen, right? I felt he did a decent job playing the disgruntled, elite military man with a chip on his shoulder and a moral weight greater than the U.S. Debt. You'll feel the angst and vigor within him, especially when it comes during the action scenes where he takes leader commands. It is O'Brien who kind of steals the show though. As a vigilante youth looking to make his own justice, O'Brien's acting is on point for representing the ""enthusiasm"" the modern world breeds today. As an action hero, you'll get that candor of bravado, raw emotion, and determination we all like to take point on. And as the female audience members whispered in the air, ""he looks so hot"" doing it to. Their chemistry together is a big driving factor as well, heated to keep tension going and establish a dynamic that keeps you wondering what happens next. DISLIKE: Rushed: While the pace is fast, it is also a little too fast to really meld you into the story. I did feel integrated into the program, but at the same time I had difficulty with connecting to the character development role. The rushed pace gives you little in terms of backstory and internal though process, that most of the characters feel like robotic shells instead of the people that the book crafted. This is especially true with the supporting characters, who despite being heavily integrated, are just background characters who say a few things before being lost to the stunts. Fast can be good, but fast can be so bad. Predictability: Despite all the hype the trailers promised, there wasn't much in terms of surprise in this movie. I agree with my friends, that there isn't much surprise to this film, merely a long- winded battle between spiteful parties. Where my hopes were dashed, is that an agent of the antagonist's caliber would pull a few more surprises from his hat to mix up the pursuit and try to fool elite agent Keaton. Sadly, the adaptation was all about cramming stunts than strategy into the movie, leaving us stranded with a predictable assortment of sequences and scenes. I guess everyone can't be the Dark Knight's Joker huh?Mediocre action: Perhaps I set this bar high, but the trailers promised me high adrenaline stunts and espionage warfare that would leave me on the edge of my seat. Unfortunately, the hype didn't live up for me. American Assassin's fights have some edge in their violence and viciousness, but past that there isn't any impressive choreography, unique stunts, or even proper length to the fire fights outside of maybe one battle. These short quips fit in well with the design of the movie, but at least make them suspenseful, or high adrenaline to keep me invested in the urgency of the situation. Most will enjoy the action to this film, happy with the satisfying thrill of killing terrorists, but I like a little more budget in the stunts for me. The VERDICT:American Assassin is a decent movie, low key enough to pull more people in, but also spicy enough to bring that satisfaction to the mercenary loving group. The prideful presentation of country pride, political espionage, and killing terrorists will get many feeling great, only further vitalized by the acting. However, the predictable plot, rushed development and mediocre action weren't up to the challenge of making this movie epic for me. Chances are the book has a lot more meat and content to it, but movie wise you can save this one for a home streaming service and be just as entertained. My score: Action/Thriller: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.5",American Assassin
46,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of American Assassin,5,19 September 2017,"Punches are thrown, bullets are unloaded, a murky plot conforms, and bloodletting is a mainstay in 2017's American Assassin (my latest review). The story of ""Assassin"" chronicles Mitch Rapp (played by Dylan O'Brien). After Mitch loses his parents and his girlfriend gets murdered on a beach in Ibiza, Spain, he decides to go after the maligned terrorists who committed said murder. Rapp first goes out on his own to acquire vengeance until he is swallowed up by U.S. Special Forces. They eventually recruit him and he gets trained by an icy black ops dude in Stan Hurley (played by Michael Keaton). Now with American Assassin, we've seen this all before. The techno thriller, the slick thriller, the CIA thriller, the locale thriller. ""Assassin"" has these attributes and has them with bells on. You watch this film hoping that it's not routine. In the end though, American Assassin is The Gunman, The November Man, The Bourne Identity, Paranoia, The Recruit, and 3 Days to Kill all thrown into a high- powered blender. Sure there's a brisk pace to all of it, the violence invariably spills onto the screen, and a cool nuclear explosion straight out of Deep Impact arises. But ""Assassin"" has action sequences that have fits and starts. With every director close-up and every deafening bone crack, there's never a true sense of excitement or rooting involvement. Anyway, American Assassin is taken from a novel but it doesn't appear as such. Instead, this flick is overly commercial, has a loud, ""popcorn"" feel to it, and has a real preposterous indignation from the get-go. The Age of Innocence (1993), The English Patient (1996), and The Firm (1993) are all movies that are based on books. ""Assassin"" doesn't quite harbor that same vibe if you know what I mean.As for the actors in American Assassin, well some are miscast (Sanaa Lathan as a Deputy Director), some have the physicality but you don't really root for them (Dylan O'Brien), and some come off as standard in the villain department (yes I'm talking about Taylor Kitsch). The one guy who rises above ""Assassin's"" regimented material is Michael Keaton.Heck, it seems like a lifetime ago when Keaton took on comedic roles. Now he has officially morphed into the quintessential bad-ass. With a closed-off persona, a lack of empathy, and a ruthlessly provoked nature, he's the best reason to see ""Assassin"". In one concluding scene, Michael's Stan bites the ear off a bad guy and then spits it right back at him. Billy ""Blaze"", we hardly knew ya. In conclusion, American Assassin is directed by Michael Cuesta. He created a wonderful character study with Jeremy Renner in 2014's Kill the Messenger. Cuesta needs to get back to that kind of textured filmmaking because ""Assassin"" comes really close to ""shooting"" itself in the foot. Rating: 2 stars.",American Assassin
47,Kingslaay,Great action film,8,20 September 2017,As an action film American Assassin ticks all the boxes. It has a simple yet powerful plot that is sure to connect with many viewers. We see a transformation from a normal and happy person to one bent on getting revenge and justice for all that he lost. The performances are good and action scenes were a treat to watch. If you are not a fan of action movies with a decent plot then this film is probably not for you. People die and drop like flies but you are enjoying the ride so much you barely notice. We want to see this young man accomplish his goal and find some kind of closure. 7.8/10,American Assassin

51,Troy_Campbell,A mixed bag of awesomeness and dullness.,6,18 September 2017,"This espionage action-thriller is actually a difficult movie to gauge. It's a wildly erratic bag of hits and misses; some elements are surprisingly excellent but there are also stretches of the film that are absolutely yawn inducing. Based on Vince Flynn's 2010 novel of the same name, it attempts to combine the one-man-army guns'n'explosions-fest of the Arnie and Sly era with the resourceful-hero-who-makes-mistakes realism of Bourne and new age Bond. Our eponymous anti-hero is Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brien), a tormented revenge-seeker whose sole focus is bringing down the terrorist cell who brutally murdered his fiancé. He's happy to die of course, which, although endearing to a certain extant, also means he makes some pretty stupid decisions. O'brien is a solid action star who convinces in the hand-to-hand fights and gun battles whilst offering a decent dose of charisma, yet struggles to fully engage thanks to a few acting shortcomings. Think a younger version of Keanu Reeves. He's supported by Michael Keaton (enjoying his career renaissance) as gruff CIA veteran Stan Hurley, but even the Oscar-nominated actor can't do much to hide the lacklustre and predictable script. Occasionally feeling like a clever homage to 80s and 90s action flicks, but more often coming across as flat-out uninspired, the plot signposts its twists and hits its beats with the bland routine of typical straight-to-DVD dross. Yet the set pieces are executed with an unexpected flair and brutality that gives them a compelling edge. A handful of sequences—including the shockingly violent opening and a bruising bathroom encounter—are nothing short of A-grade action. Frustratingly inconsistent with moments of awesomeness, American Assassin could be your next favourite popcorn flick. Or the reason you stop spending your hard earned at the cinema.",American Assassin

This was born from a pretty stupid book that was also childish and simple-minded.The book was a total rip-off of An Officer and a Gentleman to the point that I was surprised the author didn't lift the ""steers and queers"" line. The story is so ridden with clichés it's like they used a Micro Soft boilerplate model for the script. Butch-sounding name: Mitch Rapp. Check. Grizzly old vet training the new punk kid.

54,IonicBreezeMachine,Solid if unexceptional spy thriller.,6,28 December 2020,"After losing his fiance to a terrorist attack in Ibiza, Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brien has dedicated himself to seeking revenge on the terror cell that orchestrated the attack. His actions attract the attention of CIA deputy director Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan) who uses Rapp to lead them to the cell and taking out its leads before Rapp is able to do so. Rapp having been denied his revenge is given the option of facing consequences for his unsanctioned actions or joining a CIA unit Orion headed by Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton). After his induction into the program Rapp and the team begin tracking enriched material for nuclear weapons and find that their assignment may link back to Orion's past.Directed by Michael Cuesta and based on a popular series of novels by Vince Flynn, an adaptation of the Mitch Rapp series has been gestating for a number of years. Originally intended to begin with an adaptation of Consent to Kill and to star Gerard Butler and be directed by Antoine Fuqua, production stalls ended up curtailing that plan and the two instead went on to make a similar politically charged action thriller with the reasonably successful Fallen series beginning with Olympus has Fallen. This adaptation ops for a somewhat Batman Begins style origin story approach to the material with Dylan O'Brien in the lead, and while the plot is very familiar, it's elevated by a no holds barred intensity and good performances that make it more engaging than similarly mid budgeted espionage thrillers.The movie's central performance by Dylan O'Brien is very good. After nearly losing his life to a stunt gone wrong on the final Maze Runner movie O'Brien apparently considered leaving the industry, but if his performance here is any indication, O'Brien has untapped potential that'll make him a household name when he's put in the right material. We see O'Brien bring his charisma and charm to the forefront with some nice dashes of humor and likability, but also a sense of darkness and festering rage that can make him seem like a powder keg just waiting for an opportunistic spark. The movie also has some good supporting players, but none more so than Michael Keaton as mentor figure Stan Hurley with an energized intensity that's more focuses and honed than Rapp's, the interactions between O'Brien and Keaton especially during the film's opening training sequences make for some intense and entertaining viewing.The plot is a slightly more mixed bag unfortunately. While I liked the first half of the movie and its focus on showing Rapp's induction into the world of espionage and counterintelligence, once the main plot takes over around the halfway point the movie loses much of its interest and starts to feel like a rehash of 90s action thrillers like Broken Arrow or The Peacemaker. The movie unfortunately is lacking in terms of not just a compelling crisis, but also a charismatic or imposing villain. We essentially have TWO villains in American Assassin, and one ultimately ends up serving as a disposable pawn of the other so not only do we have two underdeveloped antagonists, we don't even have a satisfying conclusion to one of them that we spent developing.The action sequences in American Assassin are at least intense and satisfyingly violent (even if some overdone CGI in the climax feels at odds with the rest of the movie) and be it in the gunfights or hand to hand combat sections director Cuesta knows how to capture the intensity and chaos of these moments whilst also making them comprehensible to the viewer.American Assassin has some decent elements, but it's probably not the best way to whet peoples' appetites for an intended film franchise. While the performances of O'Brien and Keaton are really good and the action sequences are brutal with well captured impact, the movie lacks a compelling plot or antagonist especially in the second half when it succumbs to well worn action thriller cliches. You'll get your money's worth from a watch, but there's not much to bring you back for seconds.",American Assassin
55,saptesh786,Might be movie of Scott Adkins!,5,10 October 2018,"Just seen this title. Major mistake is that the miscast of leading hero. He is not perfect for role of 'Rapp'. I wonder why not this role offered to Scott Adkins as he is perfect for this role. Rather he deserves the role. Instead of this he was casted for a role of extra. What a pity! That's why this action packed movie does not impress us. Michael Keaton did his role perfectly and looks believable rather than hero. Half of the movie goes in waste. Nothing happen interestingly. Also end is open. But we did not want to see Rapp himself again.

His special talents are recognized by Lathan, head of the CIA and manages to recruit him so he can accomplish his mission that dives right with what the CIA wants to accomplish as well. He is trained by Keaton, who is an ex-Navy Seal. Amazingly, Keaton is in really good shape for his age and does a great job. All in all, this is worth watching.

62,bankofmarquis,Serviceable and entertaining enough,7,26 September 2017,"I was asked the other day when I was going to see American ASSASSIN.  They were interested in reading my review.  At that moment, I realized that I had seen American ASSASSIN over a week ago and hadn't gotten around to writing the review.Which pretty well sums up this film.American ASSASSIN follows the tale of action spy Mitch Rapp, the literary creation of St. Paul, MN native, Vince Flynn.  When a bad guy...You can fill in the rest.This film is a pretty ""by-the-book"" action/spy thriller.  Did you see Tom Cruise in the JACK REACHER films?  It's better than that.  Did you see Matt Damon in the JASON BOURNE films?  It's not as good as that.As the central character, Dylan O'Brien (THE MAZE RUNNER) does a nice job of jumping up from a YA hero to an adult action hero.  He is grit and determination and remains unfazed throughout the proceedings.Again, pretty ""by the book"", but not bad either.The only real spark in this film is Michael Keaton's Stan Hurley - the ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" of this film (you know, the aging hero who is working with his talented, yet reckless, protégé).  Mr. Keaton becomes more and more watchable from film to film as he ages very gracefully and interestingly before our eyes.The rest of the film?  Pretty standard, but entertaining, stuff.  Not a bad way to spend a few hours.Just don't expect to find it very unique or uniquely memorable, either.Letter Grade:  B7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",American Assassin
63,dave-mcclain,"""American Assassin"" is a clichéd but entertaining entry into the spy thriller subgenre.",7,15 September 2017,"For people all around the world, the September 11th terrorist attacks on the U.S. were very personal. Whether you knew someone who was lost that day, you're an ordinary American whose country was attacked, or you're just a compassionate human being who abhors religious extremism and violence against innocents, you probably remember on that day feeling some combination of anger, fear and sorrow – which you may still feel today. The callous boldness, extreme barbarism and sheer scale of those attacks made anti-terrorism efforts a top priority in law enforcement, homeland security and international relations for the U.S. and for freedom-loving countries and people across the globe.Many individuals got personally involved in the struggle by joining the military or some other part of the government which fights terrorism – and many more started doing what they could within the confines of their lives, while wishing they could do more. I'm sure plenty of us wished that we were pulling that trigger when Osama Bin Laden finally wound up on the business end of an American rifle – or that we could be a skilled and heroic special operator taking down terrorist cells. It's that kind of desire which we see play out in the 2017 action thriller ""American Assassin"" (R, 1:51) – a desire that's burning very deeply in the heart of the main character for whom defeating terrorists has become very personal.Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brien) lost both his parents in a car accident when he was 14, but finally finds happiness in his 20s with his girlfriend, Katrina (Charlotte Vega), to whom he proposes on a beach in Spain. Moments later, as Mitch is at the bar buying a couple celebratory drinks, Katrina is shot and killed in a terrorist attack. Fast- forward a year and a half. Mitch appears listless, but actually he's bitter – and motivated – and he's been very busy. A few short scenes show us that he has learned to fight and shoot, to speak Arabic and quote from the Koran and to act like a Muslim. Mitch has become a self-appointed one-man counter-terrorism task force, pretending that he's interested in being a suicide bomber so he can infiltrate the terrorist cell run by the man responsible for his fiancé's death and exact his revenge.Mitch's quest for vengeance doesn't end up quite as he envisioned, but he comes to the attention of CIA counter-terrorism official Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan) who says that they ""like his agenda"". She proposes that Mitch and the CIA help each other. He is reluctant to surrender any of his terrorist-fighting autonomy, but Irene convinces him to get with the program. She takes him to her late father's Seal Team 6 buddy, Stan Hurley (Oscar nominee Michael Keaton), who runs a small, secret counter-terrorism training camp in the woods of northern Virginia. Hurley is tough, skilled and smart. Mitch is all of those things too, but he's also extremely stubborn and impulsive, a rogue among rogues.Yet, Mitch and Stan have to learn to work together and depend on each other to accomplish a critical new mission. The CIA learns that a former special operator simply called Ghost (Taylor Kitsch), with whom Stan has a problematic history, is shopping around a stolen plutonium core to some pretty bad dudes from Iran. (Apparently, that 2015 American-Iranian nuclear deal is making it tough for the Iranians to get a nuclear weapon but they still very much want one.) Mitch and Stan travel to Rome, along with another one of Stan's trainees (Scott Atkins) where they all link up with a sexy Turkish agent (Shiva Negar) in an attempt to keep the plutonium out of the hands of Iranian agents who are assembling materials and people to make a nuclear device, which they have specific and imminent plans to use.""American Assassin"" is a clichéd but entertaining entry into the spy thriller subgenre. Michael Keaton's character is accused by another character of being a relic of the Cold War, which sounds about right, because so are the movie's plot points and twists. Still, director Michael Cuesta (director and producer of numerous TV series, including ""Homeland"" and ""Dexter"") and screenwriters Stephen Schiff (TV's ""The Americans""), Michael Finch (""Hitman: Agent 47"") and writing partners Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz (who co-wrote ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"", ""The Last Samurai"" and several other movies and shows) breathe new life into those tried and true spy movie tropes by giving this story a modern spin to which most Movie Fans can relate, at least on some level. Keaton is appropriately bad- ass, O'Brien is charismatic and exciting to watch, Negar is as deadly as she is beautiful and Kitsch makes a great villain. Also, Lathan does a fine job as the ""M"" to O'Brien's young James Bond character type. Good things all. Not just for the sake of this movie, but for the sake of the forthcoming franchise which this movie heralds. Based on the 11th novel (but first chronologically) in late author Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series, ""American Assassin"" gets the film series off to an unspectacular, but solid start. ""B+""",American Assassin
64,swilliky,Probably not a spy franchise starter but mildly enjoyable,5,19 September 2017,"The novels by Vince Flynn create a compelling character that hopes to transfer to cinema as some of his other spy predecessors have before. Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brien) has an interesting origin story that is controversial in this day and age and glossed over quite a lot in the film. In a brutal opening scene, Rapp experiences awful tragedy while vacationing on a beach in Spain with his fiancé to whom he just purposed. Terrorists invade the beach and kill his fiancé and shoot him. The story jumps forward 18 months where Rapp is in a dark place, training at MMA and shooting at the gun range. I have only read the first part of the first book but could already spot significant differences that change the tone of the story and make Rapp out to be a little more of a loose cannon than a future secret agent.Somehow, his odd behavior and fraternizing with terrorists leads him to a cell that the CIA could not find. He is about to attack when a task force swoops him to save him. Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan) has been watching Rapp and decided that he would be perfect for a secret program known as Orion. After interrogating him for a few days, she takes him out to a secret training facility in Virginia led by the older spy Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton). The major plot starts to develop as nuclear material goes missing and a renegade American spy Ghost (Taylor Kitsch) is seen making mysterious deals. Ghost was trained by Hurley and hold a grudge against his former tutor.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",American Assassin

Even with a smaller budget than other thrillers; the movie gets very tense situations and is able to give some deep to some characters.If you are looking for serious movie about about ""covert operations"" and the danger and people involved you will feel somewhat disappointed. It is not that the movie is not trying to be serious; it just happens that the director did not dare to go as darker as the subject pointed.Let's be clear. The main character Mitch has his fiancée randomly killed in a beach resort in Spain by a group of Islamic terrorist just shooting everybody. The scene is terrifying because it reminds of recent UK and France events. Mitch looks for vengeance at any cost (even his own life); he self trained, learn Arab and is able to infiltrate the terrorist cell. But before he can complete his vengeance; is rescued and recruited by the CIA and sent to training with covert opts expert; played really good by Michael Keaton. Mitch is somewhat a nutcase and the movie is clear about it; but after a while the movie just make him a rebel and a soft person. He mostly kills in self defense and in the only real assassination he sees another person image.As entertaining as the movie is; the final showdown with an A bomb explosion on the sea with USA army; looks cheap and unrealistic.However; a torture scene where Michael Keaton is tortured by GHOST (Taylor Kitsch delivering a very serious and intense performance) is really outstanding in what it makes you feel.At the end; the movie tries to create a hero from what is really a damaged person. And that takes out most of the realism of what it seems was a very smart novel",American Assassin
67,vampire_hounddog,A heavy handed wish fulfillment terrorist action movie,4,19 September 2020,"Some time after his girlfriend (Charlotte Vega) is killed by terrorists while they were on holiday in Ibiza, American Mitch's (Dylan O'Brien) life is changed forever and spends his time obsessing on how he can take revenge by convincing terrorists he is a jihadi convert. The CIA have been monitoring him but come to the conclusion that he is not a terrorist sympathiser but instead decide to recruit him into a Black Ops team to take out the bad guys.A wish fulfillment action film and although the action is effectively done, it doesn't take long for the film to suffer from a lack of credibility, becomes too silly and heavy handed.",American Assassin
68,Carycomic,JOHN WICK meets MAN ON FIRE...and God help anybody caught in the middle.,9,15 September 2017,"Dylan O'Brien is a relatively new name to me. But, he did a very convincing job portraying Mitch Rapp. A man who trains himself single-mindedly (and almost single-handedly) to track down the terrorist leader responsible for the death of his five-minute fiancé' (along with dozens of other innocent tourists) in Spain eighteen months earlier.It's a mixed blessing, though, that he tracks down the terrorists posing as an American jihadist sympathizer. Because it makes the CIA aware of his existence. Not to mention, gets him captured--and nearly killed--by his quarry through a bit of overconfidence! What follows is admittedly pretty predictable. Rescue by counter- terrorist commandos; an offer he can't refuse (train to be an anti- terrorist hit man or go to Federal prison); the training, itself, under ex-Navy SEAL Stan Hurley (enjoyably played by Michael Keaton); and, of course, the literal baptism-by-fire overseas when Team Orion crosses paths with renegade ex-teammate ""The Ghost"" (almost too-well played by Taylor Kitsch) who has a hidden agenda more shocking than all his accomplices!I won't spoil the rest of the plot. Suffice it to say that, as end-of-summer blockbusters go (technically, the first day of fall isn't till Sept. 22), this movie is well worth the admission price.",American Assassin
69,brankovranjkovic,American Assassin: Yet another generic spy film,6,22 September 2017,"This is an action spy adventure with a revenge theme.The lead is Mitch Rapp who is an 'ordinary Joe' who trains himself into an anti-terror vigilante following the tragic opening scene, on a holiday beach where we see his fiancée brutally gunned down by terrorists. He becomes a very driven one-man-army, his focus is bringing down the responsible terrorist cell.Nothing new, and mediocre when compared to James Bond, Jason Bourne, or John Wick, better than 2nd Jack Reacher film.",American Assassin
70,skepticskeptical,A pastiche of familiar tropes,5,4 August 2019,"I accidentally watched American Assassin twice. I realized it several minutes into the second viewing and then figured that I should see it through since that way I could rate it and never make the same mistake again. This movie is not even very old, and I still found its basic plot unworthy of committing to long term memory. I am not saying that the movie is horrible, but it is manifestly a pastiche of every cliché and trope in the spy thriller/terrorist thriller/special ops/action thriller/martial arts/extreme violence & horror genre (because of the excessive gore) play book.A lot is lifted directly from the Bourne trilogy, as everyone will immediately recognize. Then we have some flashbacks to Homeland and the George Clooney former-spy movies (one is called The American, but I believe there was another one as well). Which reminds me: cannot directors/writers come up with more original titles than The American, Assassin, and all of its variants? It is impossible to keep track of all of the mediocre movies with related titles.In addition to all of the Bournesque scenes, the ¨big boats jostled in the bathtub scene¨ is very familiar, but I won´t go into any more details. Despite its manifest lack of originality and insistence on rehashing hackneyed themes of revenge, lost love, American exceptionalism and hegemony (We are good, and they are evil!) etc., American Assassin is definitely watchable. After all, I watched it twice! But that was by accident, and I will never watch it again.",American Assassin

72,TheTruthofItIs,Pretty decent revenge actioner,8,13 August 2020,"American Assassin was a very entertaining rogue-agent action film starring relative unknown Dylan O'Brien, but with celebrity support like trim/toned Michael Keaton, an unexpectedly chunky Sanaa Lathan (""Donna Tubbs"" from ""The Cleveland Show""), and a still-looks-like-his-role-on-Battleship Taylor Kitsch.

75,latinfineart,A very very poor adaptation,4,17 June 2020,"Vince Flynn was one of the top spy/espionage writers of our generation. He's right up there with Barry Eisler. In terms of the best writers out there in this genre. It is such a shame he is no longer with us. For them to have taken a series as great as the Mitch Rapp series to have made a film this pathetic out of it is a cinematic abomination. O'Brien was completely miscast as Mitch Rapp. Rapp is not that guy! He is at least three inches taller. He's much bigger, much tougher, much smarter. He's a great soldier. And a great warrior. This kid was a bitter punk with six to 12 months of training, who knew nothing about anything. He took everything into his own hands without any orders. Yet he continued to get away with total subordination at every corner..This film was beyond ridiculous. It was bordering on junk. They went with a discount Director. Even Michael Keaton and Scott Adkins could not save this turkey. Don't waste your time if you're a Vince Flynn or Mitch Rapp fan. If you don't know anything about the series, you might find it modestly entertaining at best.",American Assassin

78,nikola17,Not Bad But Should Been A Lot More Better,3,20 September 2017,"*** review contains spoilers*** never read the books never have heard of it until film come out i got interest then i thought it was good fun action decent scenes are good but not greatest or best movie i have ever scene. story is interesting all that but i wish movie is little bit better more action more violence more of revenge story but movie plot still went very well i thought actor from Maze Runner 1&2 Dylan O'Brien but i wish it could be a different actor different guy but i was OK with Dylan O Brien he is good not greatest actor i have ever seen but he did good OK for lead actor not highest body count. Plot follows Mitch Rapp (Dylan O Brien) was in holiday with his girlfriend Katrina (Charlotte Vega) who was not in movie that only for 30 seconds or less terrorist went to beach killed rampaged everyone and Katrina dies and Mitch Survived, 18 Months Later he pretends to Join Terrorist so he can kill Terrorist guy jihad. so Mitch goes out for revenge to kill Jihad, Mitch is not joining Terrorist group he is their to take out Jihad out after suddenly ambushed by U.S. Special Forces Killed Jihad That Upset over the perception that he has been denied his vengeance i wish he could of killed him then Special forces would come and Ambushed Terrorist group. Mitch Met CIA Deputy Director Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan)actress who did Alien VS Predator (2004), Blade (1998), Drive (1997) she made choice to Put Mitch in Group of black operations unit codenamed Orion Its head, Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton) did a great job of his character he is good in movie iliked his character tough character, is a former U.S. Navy SEAL and a Cold War veteran who trains Rapp and the other potential recruits in asymmetrical warfare. you have greatest fighter in world Boyka Undisputed, Close Range, Ninja 1&2, El Gringo(Scott Adkins)Victor witch he does act but not really much of his character he doesn't do much in movie as character noting to do but what i am dissportant about they wasted him in movie for noting he is only in it for 30 minutes then their you go Scott Adkins that's end of it so for fans don't pay ticket just to see him in it because he is only in it for 30 minutes witch i wish he did a lot more in movie as cameo their is many ways to give Scott Adkins to do something rather then seeing him getting wasted for noting. (Taylor Kitsch)actor best known for Battleship, John Carter, Savages best known for that movies he did he play's character called Ghost that's his name no one knows who his real name he is main villain witch i think of him as villain is weak villain not much of him like dialog or anything that it's really noting special about his role but i bet he did it because for paycheck witch i haven't seen that actor for longtime he play's character who use to be a Navy SEAL and Orion operative believed to have been killed in action and now going by the codename ""Ghost"" i am like ?? what is this after He Left Battleship then becomes villain lol. his character is a person who wants to blow up NAVY Seals Ship with a mpending nuclear attack through CIA channels, assumes battle formation and nuclear attack protocol. i thought the action is well done it's well shot the action wasn't the best i have never was best but it was fun at seeing it, i got Disappointed Wasted Scott Adkins character for noting, but i didn't really hate film for that. I liked Story And Story Is Like You Never Saw That Coming Witch Is great I though final showdown fight scene with Mitch and Ghost was noting special fight scene at boat I Am Like What Is This Events After Happened Battleship & Savages Taylor Kitsch Is playing Kinda similar character as that Navy SEAL I Am like Battleship (2012) I Thought Taylor character should have been Lead Role Actor i know he is not American, He Is Canadian but he could be good lead but as villain noting special about him as Villain but I Liked Michael Keaton character playing badass though guy former U.S. Navy SEAL and a Cold War veteran, worth for his character does well done job i thought he do American Assassin as lead actor better but i Enjoyed Dylan O Brien as lead actor noting wrong with him i just Want Better Lead Actor Witch I Can Think Of Better Actor Then Him Good One. But Still Dylan Did A Good Job I Thought It Was A okay average But It's Not Really Much of Action Type it's more Thriller then Action but still their is a lot Hand to Hand Combat Shooting all that fun to watch as well But More Thrilling Film Then A Action flick I Give It A 3.10 For It",American Assassin
79,stevenrotherforth,Half arsed assassin,5,15 March 2018,"American Assassin For a movie that starts out so very promising it is with great disappointment that I write this review.
American Assassin's strong opening is all the more poignant due to recent real life events that mirror the onscreen horror.
Director Michael Cuesta handles the carnage effectively but his movie soon becomes just another action flick that is only just elevated above straight to DVD status.
This movie narrowly avoids the bargain bin due to the excellent cast and strong production values.
The ending of the movie merits this as though it may be ludicrously far fetched the finale is some what of a spectacle. You can definitely see where a large chunk of the budget went.
Speaking of the excellent cast
Michael Keaton is always likeable as he dials in his performance. He plays Stan Hurly a tough as nails former Navy Seal who is tasked with whipping Dylan O'Briens character (Mitch Rapp) into shape. Cool name may I add?Rapp witnesses his wife get murdered on the beach by terrorists whilst they are on holiday. He then devotes his life to payback only to have his chance of revenge snatched from his grasp.
Rapp then finds himself under the recruitment of the CIA and he is trained to carry out black ops missions. Yes the whole story is silly and contrived.
This could be forgiven if we were given a compelling storyline for us viewers to get our teeth into.
Sadly we are treated to a painting by numbers affair that barely manages to maintain the audiences attention.
O'Brien is fairly convincing as what could be the next action hero but the script unlike our youthful hero isn't all that fresh.Supporting cast such as Scott Adkins is under used. He actually can kick some arse yet they decide to leave him pretty much on the sidelines.
Taylor Kitsch's character is massively underdeveloped wasting his talent on a paper thin villain.
Dylan O'Brien should take note of Kitsch's faded stardom. It only takes a couple of turkeys to set back a once promising career.
Whilst I wouldn't say that this particular movie is a complete turkey it isn't high calibre material that will elevate an actor to superstardom.
Further more for those who consider themselves to be a true petrolhead then the generic car chase scene will have you crying into your popcorn. 
The demise of a rather delectable Alfa Romeo Brera was enough to send me over the edge.
All jokes aside such observations should not have been made if I was indeed entertained and enthralled in the actual movie. Instead I was more interested in the make of car on screen or trying to figure out if the female lead was the woman from Alien Vs Predator!
To sum this one up then it's a film that's probably more fun if you're drunk. Even so, you still won't remember it the next day.",American Assassin
80,p-jonsson,Not too bad actually,7,26 August 2019,"This movie has been sitting on my unwatched shelf for quite a while and yesterday I finally got around to watch it.I actually found this movie to be not too bad actually. It is far from a cinematic masterpiece but it is a pretty solid action/revenge movie. Dylan O'Brien is, unfortunately, pretty meh as the main character. Michael Keaton on the other hand is quite good in his character.It is a reasonably action filled movie and I really like that they didn't try to turn it into some PG-13 crap. It is sometimes fairly brutal. The story is okay. It works. It is not overly complex and some people are probably moaning about it not being original enough. Well, I say, so what? It is a good concept so why screw with it? I do like revenge movies and although this one is far from the best, it is not at all shabby.I wonder why some people seems to be claiming that this movie is just crap, one star out of ten and so on and so forth? Is it maybe because it dares bring up the subject of Islamist fanatics killing innocents? Or maybe because it doesn't try to sugarcoat things and explain these ""poor misunderstood"" psychopaths but lays the blame straight on said lowlife as well as on Iran? Or maybe because it doesn't try to blame certain of today's' preferred boogieman Russia?I have not read the book so I guess, if it doesn't do the book justice, I can somewhat understand not liking it. However, to me, this was a decent, not spectacular but decent, two hours of entertainment. Decent action, decent speed and (with the exception of O'Brien) decent acting.",American Assassin
81,LegendaryFang56,"Pretty underwhelming for an ""action movie.""",6,5 July 2021,"For an action movie, it wasn't as thrilling to watch like it should've been or as thrilling as you'd expect. I'm not sure whether to consider that a bad thing or a good thing. The whole plot after what happened in regards to what changed Mitch was pretty subpar. It could've been because of the writing, and that's to blame. Maybe there was a similar plot in one of the books, but I'm sure it was done a whole lot better.Orion, a special, secret team of ""Ghosts"" was probably the only thing that was actually interesting, yet that wasn't further expanded on.There were a couple of cool moves as far as the fighting goes, but the choreography overall wasn't that good and the sound effects only made it worse. And the last fight sequence was the worse possible combination of the two. It was acted and choreographed in a way that made each attack look like it was hard, except the volume of the sound effects was set so low, for whatever reason, which took the immersion out of the fight, provided you were even immersed in it, to begin with.I'm a fan of Dylan O'Brien, even though Teen Wolf is the only show/movie I've watched that he's in. But for this to be his second major movie being the main actor of, the first Maze Runner movie being the first, and the rest excluded, is disappointing.",American Assassin
82,Ramascreen,Dylan O'Brien the action man,4,12 September 2017,"#AmericanAssassin movie starring #DylanOBrien is a flawed but entertaining spy thriller. There are many parts about it that just don't work and it's very generic especially if you're an avid political spy thriller novels reader like yours truly, so while the character, Mitch Rapp, isn't quite yet comparable to Jack Ryan, this film is a showcase of what Dylan O'Brien can do as an action star and I think it can catch on for his army of fans.Based on Vince Flynn's novel series, Dylan O'Brien plays a CIA black ops recruit, Mitch Rapp, whose fiancé was killed by terrorists . He eventually finds himself under the training and guidance of a tough Cold War veteran Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton). CIA director Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan) then sends Rapp and Hurley to investigate a wave of attacks that seem to point to a rogue operative with a connection to Hurley's past.I think the biggest problem with ""American Assassin"" for me is that it feels choppy, some of the cuts and editing work that just seems like it doesn't go through that fine-tuning process. That may have been an effective strategy to design a trailer/preview but as a movie, it will just annoy you. The other big problem is how one-dimensional some of the characters are especially the Turkish agent played by Shiva Negar, the film just expects you to feel for her when there's no foundation set up to build that connection to her character. I haven't read Vince Flynn's novels, I'm sure he was a talented writer, may he rest in peace, but the concept of rogue operative and a nuclear bomb as the end game have been played out way too many times in the spy thriller genre that it goes to what I said earlier about this film being generic, it doesn't really offer anything new or anything other than what we've seen a thousand times before. This whole thing to me is more or less a test run to see if Dylan O'Brien can graduate from a young adult franchise like ""Maze Runner"" and become this next big action star. And equal to that, this is also a test run to see if O'Brien's character, Mitch Rapp, can fill the void that the Jack Ryan movie franchise left behind. I think O'Brien has the potential but with ""American Assassin,"" Mitch Rapp is off to a rocky start.-- Rama's Screen --",American Assassin
83,asb_deutsch,Somewhat enjoyable but predictable,6,19 September 2017,"I watched this movie as the trailer was pulsating. As for the film, both O'Brien and Keaton do justice in their roles and acting was top-notch. And for a cast of mainly unknowns, the acting felt real and overrides the story-line. I would love to see more of Charlotte Vega in the future!The ending visuals were dazzling and impressive without any need of so-called ""being immersed in 3D"". If you are the person dying to watch the same old Rogue Story or a new story of Hobbits like Fantastic Beasts...just don't go. But if you really want something refreshing without the prequel/sequel tag, there is no harm in trying!Watched it with Stronger (for free!) Overall, a decent one-time action flick watch could have been more better.My significant digit score: 6.5/10",American Assassin

Also starring: Yousef 'Joe' Sweid, Sanaa Lathan, David Suchet, Taylor Kitsch, Shiva Negar. Along Renegades"", this is one of the good recent actioneers that has a risk of not finding an audience it deserves. Probably because everybody thinks that yeah, trailer ain't bad, but we've seen enough stuff like this. But wide release is actually around the corner yet, so let's hope for the best. American Assassin"" may have a very typical action thriller trailer, and it's true that the story is made of clichés mostly, but the result is actually very enjoyable. The action is bloody and satisfying, the actors are good and charming, and the characters are just interesting enough to make you care. Almost all of the spy or secret agent action movies I've seen do the mistake of being pretty watchable for the most part but ruining the end: * introducing too many surprise twists to explain the events (= lazy storytelling), * taking itself too seriously (= becoming increasingly dull or heavy- handed), * or favoring often seen tired (how many times have you seen a final shootout on the roof of the building while it's raining, for example?). American Assassin"" never drops the baton, or pacing for that matter, which makes it fresher than most of its ilk. Also, the movie wins greatly by having three cool but not that widely known male actors in leads, one of them older and two younger. Let's examine them one by one, shall we? Kitsch is surely one of the greatest American action stars still unrecognized by the wider audience. He's got the muscle, the looks, the charm - what's not to like? If only his part was bigger. This is the only sad thought I had when the movie ended. You remember Kitsch from Friday Night Lights"" series, HBO's True Detective"" season 2, John Carter"" (as John Carter), Battleship"", Oliver Stone's Savages"", and The Lone Survivor"". Still can't quite recall the face? Told you so. One of the unregonignized greats. Dylan O'Brien in the lead is a star of long-running Teen Wolf"" series and also appears in The Maze Runner"" trilogy. It's good to see him starring in a movie now, and he looks fit to kick ass too! I totally bought him as a young hero. And last but not the least, let's bow down to Michael Keaton, one of the more charismatic movie stars of 1980's and 1990's who's probably not that well-known anymore. But he has lost none of the charm. This measured performance of ruthless counterterrorism veteran is probably the most memorable thing in the movie overall. Maybe it's time for Keaton revival? He's appeared in quite good projects lately - Birdman"", Spotlight"", The Founder"". Playing Vulture in newest Spider-Man"" did not probably hurt either, at least not his bank account. All in all, this movie is one of the rare positive examples where tired and overused clichés find a new life thanks to committed movie makers - CIA, terrorists, trained to kill, nuclear threat, plutonium and all the other blah blah blah is not interesting just by itself anymore. The young hero of American Assassin"" is actually the central character of so far 15 popular political thriller novels, so with any future commercial success, we may have witnessed a birth of a new action man who is interesting enough to compete with Jason Bourne, Jack Ryan, or the others. Director Michael Cuesta is also known for 2011's Roadie"" and 2014's Kill the Messenger"", look them up, both are interesting. So what if the movie is not exactly original?

90,darkreignn,A fantastic action film,9,24 September 2017,"If you're in the mood for a bloody, brutal, expertly choreographed and well acted action film, look no further than ""American Assassin."" Look, you're not looking for a great plot (though the plot is kind of interesting, if very generic towards the end) and you're not looking for Oscar worthy cinematography (though this movie is shot and framed expertly - and the opening scene? Ugh, let's just say I was in ecstasy). You're just looking for an entertaining spy movie with intense and thrilling action set-pieces, and that is EXACTLY what you will get; this movie is riveting from the opening scene. So let's get straight to the point and talk about the action: it's dirty and gory and incredible to watch on screen. Honestly, it was admirable how damn violent this movie was; I didn't expect to see torture without the camera cutting away, I didn't expect to see someone get slammed against a wall and pushed into a bathtub full of water, I didn't expect the action in this movie to be as bloody as a horror film, but for all these reasons and more is why this film was so effective. The violence isn't glamorized; it's honestly mildly gross to watch, almost as if you're watching a street fight. These people aren't fighting to show off their strength or martial arts, they're fighting to kill, and this ""kill or be killed"" mentality is apparent during every action sequence, and I'll be damned if it didn't make for gripping viewing. I mean, WOW, seeing Mitch Rapp brutally destroy his opponents by any means possible reminded me of what the fight scenes were like in the early ""Bourne"" movies. It's supremely entertaining, and if you love action movies then you have to see this.That's pretty much all I have to say, honestly. I enjoyed the hell out of this film. Michael Keaton was badass, the action was badass, the training sequences were badass, the final 10 minutes were mildly generic and mediocre but as a whole, ""American Assassin"" was a fun, badass action movie that I would wholeheartedly recommend.

I don't not like him, but, I didn't like him either. Mitch's loss was captured well enough, but somehow, his reaction to it became a bit, soporific, tiresome and juvenile. I mean, the woman who's breasts were shown needlessly, was killed because of Mitch's recklessness, and even worse, that kind of made him a hypocrite, but nobody cares. I didn't even care either, I just happened to notice that that was a tad messed up.The story too was, iffy, mainly because it lacked the gripping aspect. One of the things Irene likes about Mitch is his lawlessness, then she gives him an order, in exactly the same way Hurley was hurling them out. Mitch goes after Hurley, and when Hurley goes after him, he tells him he shouldn't have. Victor died about as easily as I would have, after all that training. Speaking of said training, it was unconvincing. Then there's Ghost, who always conveniently appears at the most opportune times, when the story is experiencing a wrinkle.American Assassin needed more layers. It was what a movie is, and though it is a finished and working product, it could've done with a little turbo, lower suspension and tints, for a meaner look.I like Dylan O'Brien, and he does the best with what he is given, which isn't very much, the same with Keaton. And Taylor Kitsch, I have no problem with him too, but as an actor, his craft is a little inconsistent. American Assassin could've definitely been better. 5/10.",American Assassin

Once Michael Keaton enters the scene, I couldn't help but think it was 89' Bruce Wayne training Robin to be the next Batman! Anyways, on the day that Mitch decides to propose to his special lady friend, a terrorist organization decides to strike, opening fire in a crowded resort killing anyone that crosses their path. You may have guessed that Mitch's girl gets killed, Mitch himself is hit several times himself but survives. And now he wants revenge. Starts some intense training and some pretty decent covert ops stuff all by his lonesome, and this gets the attention of the CIA, and gets himself recruited by Sanaa Lathan, she knows a few things about warfare, she did fight side by side with a Predator against some Xenomorphs! She see's something special in Mitch and she sends him to Michael Keaton's character Batman and he trains Mitch to be an unstoppable killing machine. And when an old foe surfaces it's Batman and Robin to the rescue! Pretty action packed, fun to watch Mitch enjoying his new job to the fullest!! Do it!!

This move should not be called ''American Assassin'', since there really is not that much assasination going on, so to speak, this film is more about international spying/espionage than assasinating targets. 
Anyways, seems like Dylan O'Brian has found a decent genre for himself, as i would not go as far as to say he was bad in this mediocre little flick, O'Brian clearly showed he is serious, when it comes to pursuing his acting career as an action movie star, eventhough the movie was quite blatant and not as witty as you would expect, he still delivered some intense, action packed moments for us to enjoy.

Mitch goes to an Assassin Training camp run by ex-Navy Seal Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton) where he does everything but follow orders. Next we hear that 15 kilos of Plutonium is missing and may go to the hands of the terrorists and all they need is a nuclear trigger and a Physicist to make all work. Be prepared for very scary opening scenes on the beach after Mitch proposes to Katrina. Very cringe worthy and we wished we didn't see this. Very scary. This is no holds barred action movie and the action, fight scenes, car chases and shootings are well choreographed. We constantly see that Mitch is always in one frame of mind: Revenge Mode; and his not following orders leads to good outcomes much to the dismay of Stan Hurley. This moves along at a very good pace and is helped tremendously by the music and superb acting by all participants. It is kind of difficult to feel concern for any of the characters when things move along so fast (and they do), but all we need to do is keep an eye on Mitch and hope he gets the job done. In time Mitch feels there is something wrong as the bad guys always seem to be one-step ahead of the good guys. Is there a Mole in the mix? (Ah, you had to ask that?)Notables: Shiva Negar as Annika, a Turkish Agent helping the CIA; Taylor Kitsch as Ghost, a one-time protégé of Stan Hurley and who shows up after a long absence.All in all a very good action movie, but there is a tendency to compare Dylan O'Brien to other action heroes. Keep in mind, this is not a competition and each action hero within a story should be rated on his own merits. I say Dylan O'Brien did just fine. Twists? Of course. There are two.

It had a fast plot, it was interesting and fun to watch. It could have been something like Jason Bourne but the movie lacked one thing. A good protagonist. No matter how cute the main actor appeared, he could not convince anyone as an assassin. And the worst part , I mean the absolutely worst part ever is that they actually had the one and only, super fighter, Scott Adkins and they did not make him the protagonist. I saw the fighting scene where Scott gets his butt kicked by this child looking actor( I have no idea who he is actually) and afterwards he is stabbed and he dies. I mean WHY?? he is Scott Adkins. He is like Bruce Lee. Hollywood can't give him roles where he ends up dead. He was the one who should lead in this film. Not this kid. I was disappointed. Other than my disappointment on the actor, the film was good. It was fast, the plot was common and unusual at the same time. You still have the feeling ,ok I have seen that so many times (revenge, blood, fanatics with bombs and nukes, unfinished businesses, loss , fast paced movie, spies moving around the globe) but it had some originality.

Add the fact the 'wooden top' Scott Adkins appears and you begin to see the failings of this film, which is a real shame as it could've been decent with a couple of changes to the cast.It would never be on a level of the 'Mission Impossible' series or even the 'Bourne' franchise but it could've been a nice alternative.

Saying that I liked some of the twists and turns. Some elements might have been cliched but other bits definitely weren't. the fighting was refreshingly adult, some of the 'workarounds' to tail or take down a perp were nicely done and it was good to see a story have the balls to tap into a very current terrorist attack to fuel a character's motivation.It was well polished, well made and very enjoyable to watch.

The thing is, they've taken a hackneyed 'implacable-vengeance fueled-over skilled-hero' vs 'nefarious duskies except for the white guy' plot and raised the game significantly.
You've seen it all before, including the plot pot-holes, but this is 'better'.
Quality production, full commitment by actors (Keaton gives the 'soup' weight), well choreographed action sequences (one suspects Asian influence) and dialogs that make sense within the parameters of the handicapped logic all combine to raise the bar for hackery substantially.
The lead could have been played by the younger version of any one of the dozen top '80s/'90s action stars.
This lead obviously did his homework, worked hard and doesn't suck as an 'action hero', but as the predominant quality I got from him is 'unprepossessing', I'm not betting he's going to lead a franchise.
On the other hand, it's time for a new generation of action heroes...so what do I know?
To be honest, if I had looked at the cast list carefully and seen the names of reputed teen-hardthrobs in it I might have had to weigh the possibility of Keaton following in Cage's recent footsteps.

111,bravesfanc,"Good, not great",6,19 September 2017,"For me, American Assassin is another movie that had I not seen the trailer, I may have enjoyed it more. The story begins on a beach with our main character, Mitch Rapp, and his soon to be fiancé. But out of no where, the beach comes under attack by terrorists and his fiancé is murdered right in front of him. Now, why he wasn't killed either doesn't really make sense, but if that happens, there is no movie.Fast forward 18 months later and you can tell Mitch has a goal and one goal only...to kill the people who murdered his fiancé. Little does he know the CIA have been following him around in hopes to recruit. When he accepts the ""job"" he is sent to Michael Keaton's character who is supposedly the best of the best.Both Dylan O'Brien (Mitch)and Michael Keaton do good jobs in their roles respectively. There is a few twists and turns but nothing you don't see coming and the action, while limited is pretty good as well. I just hoped for a little more and I felt the ending was a bit anti climatic. The second half of this movie is Mitch's first mission with Keaton and the guy they are after isn't all what he seems to be.This is a book series that I hadn't even heard of so I can't compare the two.

The guy ends up trying to infiltrate a terrorist cell to get revenge and government spooks capture him and decide he fits the profile to be used as a government spook. I was hoping at some point it would get into the moral dilemmas of the war on terror or the kid learning a lesson, but I don't feel like that ever really happened. I just turns into the samie kind of action movie you might see Stallone or Jai Courtney in. The villain was almost more interesting than the rest of the movie, but he turned out to be very been-there-done-that. I would tell you what movie had nearly this exact same plot, but no spoilers.

115,punisherversion1,A very by the numbers but extremely well made action film.,7,27 November 2017,243: American Assassin. Here we have an adaptation of the Mitch Rapp series of action thrillers from author Vince Flynn. What caught my eye with this movie is the great Michael Keaton. He has been on a roll as an actor since coming back strong with the excellent Birdman. Now he has a main role in this film but it is certainly not a stretch for the man. He plays a gruff dedicated CIA field agent who trains these assassins that the obsessed Mitch Rapp becomes. This story is pretty formulaic. You know that right from the very beginning where we find out Mitc gets engaged to his lovely girlfriend at some island resort and then terrorists show up. This beginning scene by the way is the entire plot of The Marine 2. Do not go looking for that movie please. I beg of you. His obsessiveness and unchecked anger make him the best. Well it really shouldn't. Some moments they do play around with his recklessness being a detriment but it is quickly swept under the rug because what he did ended up doing helped the mission overall. The fight scenes and action are pretty brutal and it pulls no punches. The action is very well done with the exception of the hokey looking CGI at the tail end of the movie. This is a well made by the numbers action movie but a very good action movie. I enjoyed this film despite it being very familiar in plot and story mechanics. I give this movie a B.,American Assassin

I've never quite seen a torture seen like the one in this movie: It was graphic and really had me cringing. Also the fighting was actually really realistic seeming to me.

This needs to be said over and over, because there is always a cabal of complainers who hate any movie that doesn't faithfully follow its hardcover source. I haven't read Vince Flynn's American Assassin, and I don't intend to. But I feel fairly confident that he wasn't writing a movie. American Assassin (the movie) is a film-telling of the original story; it is NOT the original story, and it doesn't pretend to be. (Memo to Vince Flynn fanatics: Don't go see it.) American Assassin is a terrific watch, if for no other reason than seeing Dylan O'Brien nail it. And he is well aided by his supporting cast, most especially Michael Keaton, Taylor Kitsch and Saana Lathan. (I would like to have included Shiva Negar, but her character is severely compromised by problematic writing. She did the best she could with what she was given.) The script is larded with clichés, but for the most part the actors make good use of them. Director Michael Cuesta keeps it all moving right along. Most of the characters are very thinly drawn, leaving the actors to flesh them out as best they can. The special effects range from absent entirely to overdone. The script itself lurches from event to event, with an ending that goes beyond credulity. None of this matters. Dylan O'Brien is on screen ninety percent of the time, and his character is spot on. He is totally in command, and his charisma is entirely in charge. For a movie such as American Assassin, that's what it is all about.",American Assassin

He doesn't come across as the tormented and angry soldier out for payback. He wasn't believable enough in that capacity and was completely miscast. Keaton and O'Brien on the other hand played their parts very well and I bought into their performances from the start. Also, Sanaa Lathan did a great job I barely recognized her from AVP... that's a good thing.

134,Instant_Palmer,Action Genre Franchise For Millennials or One And Done?,8,22 July 2019,"Better than many reviewers indicate.American Assassin follows Author Vince Flynn's character Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brien) and his mentor Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton) who leads a super secret CIA operative group tasked to take out the world's most threatening bad guys - A secret camp in the wooded hills near Roanoke, Virginia provides a select group of hand-picked field operatives (assassins) with elite specialized training (for assassins) that supposedly exceeds Navy Seals training in sophistication of infiltrating and blending into targeted zones, with a killing effectiveness that surpasses Bourne and Bond.One problem here - when you take on two of the most successful action franchises in movie history (Bourne and Bond), you better have your ducks in a row (including most importantly the script), and that is where this film fails.The screenwriter needed to produce a more cohesive script in adapting Flynn's prequel book. The film looks and sounds like it was rushed to production before the script and story boards were thought through and revised.Time is money, but not investing enough time sometimes leads to losing your entire investment, and if the desired outcome was a green light for a franchise, the ""fail"" here was in the script.Michael Keaton holds this film up, and although I have a hard time seeing him in the role, he pulled it off with his trade-mark push-the-envelope edginess.O'Brien was at first, hard to swallow in the role with his quiet vulnerable demeanor and school age heartthrob looks (with some edgy outlier undertones) that have made him so popular with millennials. But he frankly did an admirable job, and is the most promising element of the film in terms of franchising this into sequels. Not many lines of dialogue, but like Bourne, Rapp speaks loudly with his fists, feet, intelligence, wiliness, and willingness.The make-up was amazing in portraying an ever growing number of cuts, bruises, gashes, and other assorted traumas accrued by the cast - realistic, accurate and impressive - among the best ever in film.Action/fight/vehicle chase scenes were well above par as were the special effects and CGI (only one scene leans fully on CGI and was well done).Cinematography and editing are very good, and the pacing of the film is excellent for the most part.My guess is this is a one and done film, but what a shame, as there is great potential for an American Assassin franchise, and this is one if the best recent additions to the action genre, especially given more time to complete the film at a 007 level.The director and screenwriter(s) need to get it together though, IF there is a sequel - the script is the weakest point, usually a death nail for my reviews, but the director, cinematographer, make-up, and fx make up a lot of ground in that regard.For the hope of more (and better), I'm giving one additional Star bringing this 7-Star film up to 8/10.",American Assassin

140,cschultz-2,"Flawed, But Effective",6,17 September 2017,"In motion pictures, as in practically every other art form, the effectiveness of a performance relies heavily upon the enjoyment the artist experiences while delivering it. And Michael Keaton in ""American Assassin"" is plainly having the time of his life. As Stan Hurley, a veteran CIA black ops agent now running a training camp in Virginia for rookie agents, Keaton practically chews the scenery in his tightly-wired relish for a colorful role once rumored to have been sought by Bruce Willis. After watching Keaton's scene-stealing performance in ""American Assassin,"" it's difficult to imagine that the actor was once so indelibly associated with comedy roles that a major outcry among comic book fans was caused by his casting in the title role of director Tim Burton's 1989 version of ""Batman."" In fact, ""Batman"" changed the course of Keaton's career: Not only did the actor contribute possibly the definitive characterization to date as the conflicted, two-sided superhero, Keaton also possessed the artistic integrity to walk away from an almost-absurdly lucrative deal to continue playing the role in inferior, increasingly-cartoonish sequels after director Burton abandoned the series over creative differences with the studio's administration.That Keaton's performance in ""American Assassin"" is so enjoyable makes it even disappointing that the rest of the production does not match Keaton's exulted standards. Based on the sixth of the series of fifteen novels by the late author Vince Flynn, ""American Assassin"" details the genesis of that series' primary character, Mitch Rapp.After Rapp witnesses the brutal slaying of his fiancée during a terrorist attack on the island of Ibiza, he attempts to avenge the death on his own. But the young Rapp's aggressive, inventive, and unusually extreme solitary measures attract the attention of the CIA. The intelligence agency recruits Rapp, with the notion that partnering the young man with the seasoned operative Stan Hurley as a mentor might provide the rookie with the discipline necessary to become a more effective assassin, a killing machine, an American James Bond.Adapted from Flynn's novels by a distinguished team of writers which includes the Academy Award-winning team of Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz and directed with spirit by Michael Cuesta, the first half of ""American Assassin"" is successful in its repeating a tried-and-true formula familiar to motion pictures all the way back to ""Tell It to the Marines"" in 1926—the reluctant rookie in the charge of the hard-as-nails professional. The second half of the picture, in which Rapp and Hurley as professional equals are sent into the field to foil the detonation of a nuclear weapon by terrorists in the Middle East, is another story entirely.The major problem with ""American Assassin"" is the casting of Dylan O'Brien in the central role of Mitch Rapp. Although at age 26 the actor is familiar to adolescent audiences from his supporting role on the MTV ""Teen Wolf"" series and the ""The Maze Runner"" series of films, O'Brien seems too callow, immature, and juvenile in a role for which Gerard Butler, Matthew Fox, and Colin Farrell were also considered. Despite the fake-looking beard O'Brien sports as he's trying to infiltrate a Middle Eastern terrorist cell, the actor too often resembles a boy trying on the oversized shoes of an adult. But possibly that's the point—since ""American Assassin"" is one title in a series of fifteen, Lionsgate is plainly anticipating a Mitch Rapp series of films. In that event, O'Brien might possibly eventually grow into his role, even if he never quite carries off the dramatic gravitas of a James Bond.Or a Michael Keaton.",American Assassin

That being said, it works, most of the time. Mitch Rapp is totally believable. Michael Keaton is in darn good shape for a man his age, and his character is believable.It's too bad that the producers bowed to the cancer of political correctness and made Irene Kennedy black. That was so out of keeping with the Mitch Rapp books. Shame on Hollywood for bowing to pressure.All in all, the movie was worth the price of the ticket, and I only hope it does well enough at the box office to ensure that the series continues.",American Assassin
142,MichaelNontonMulu,Just Another One of Those Standard Special Agent Fighting Terrorist Movie,6,14 September 2017,"This movie was a rather standard spy terrorist movie. It started with a Bang, but then the pace slowed down a bit then it felt more like a rather flat thriller with occasional actions sequence here and there till the climax. The slower pace of the movie actually was a let down coz the trailer suggest a full action movie with high intensity, but it turned out that the movie fall rather short of expectation. The action sequence though, was actually pretty good. Dylan O'Brien managed to give the fighting scenes a very good performance (It seemed he prepared himself very well on this and I think experience of playing in The Maze Runner series certainly helped). Michael Keaton as usual always gave his all in his performance. His character was very convincing in this film.As I mentioned above, it was a rather standard movie whereby the story was about a man with very bad experience and enlisted to help the CIA to fight terrorism. It was adapted from a novel of the same title written by the late Vince Flynn who wrote a series of novels revolving around Mitch Rapp. This was the first of the novel series with the introduction of the character. I am not sure though whether the producer was thinking of spawning sequels based on this character. However, looking at the movie itself, I have my doubts whether it would be commercially successful enough to raise their appetite.The movie did have some interesting action sequence and I think the climax scene was pretty awesome. I think my wife shared the same view with me that those scenes were quite breathtaking and intense. The fighting scenes were also quite brutal and the killing scenes (especially the one involving a car in a sewer) were very violent and not suitable for kids. The sound effects were awesome, the special effects of the explosions were good considering the movie did not have a very large budget. Oh I also mentioned that the movie felt rather flat, which was probably due to very minimal scene that was fun to see (apart from brief scenes involving Michael Keaton in the end). So if you are looking for an action thriller movie of agents fighting terrorism and save the world from nuclear attack, then this one should be interesting enough. And if you are a fan of Vince Flynn's work specifically Mitch Rapp's character, maybe you can try and see how he is portrayed in a movie. But if you are looking for a similar type of movie with lots and lots of actions full of mind blowing fighting, explosions sequences, then perhaps this would be a bit soft for you. for my complete review, pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",American Assassin

155,RustyShacklefordd,"A Generic, But Enjoyable Action-Thriller for Fans of the Genre",6,13 September 2017,"Whether you enjoy American Assassin or not will most likely depend on what kind of film you are expecting. If you are expecting a thriller with a complex plot and characters in the vein of the Bourne series then you are probably going to be disappointed. However, if you are looking for an espionage action film that delivers when it comes to decent action sequences, you'll probably have a good time. American Assassin isn't anything anything that you haven't seen before. It's generic, predictable, and not particularly inspired. The plot is one of the most predictable I've seen in a film in quite some time where every twist is seen coming from a mile away. The climax even revolves around the old trope of our heroes trying to stop a nuclear- type weapon from killing a bunch of people. However, what makes the film work more than it doesn't is that it delivers when it comes to providing some above-average high-octane action sequences. There are a few moments of shaky-cam here and there, but most of the scenes are rather well-choreographed for a film of this caliber, especially the opening sequence which is done in the style of a single shot. The film also takes full advantage of it's R-rating displaying plenty of brutal and bloody violence including a particular torture scene that even had me wincing. Dylan O'Brien is fine in the lead role, but I personally don't feel like his character was given a lot to work with emotionally or depth beyond his motivation. The true star of the film is Michael Keaton who steals every scene he's in and providing some truly laugh-out-loud moments of comic relief. If it wasn't for him, the film honestly wouldn't have been quiet as enjoyable as it was. On a side note, Taylor Kitsch who i'm personally not a fan of did a decent job as the films villain.While it's certainly a run-of-the-mill action espionage thriller, American Assassin has enough to make it worth checking out if you are a fan of the genre thanks to solid action scenes and a great performance from Michael Keaton, although fans of the novels and those looking for a film with more depth will probably be disappointed.",American Assassin

The plot, such as it is, includes not one surprise in its entire length, especially where depicting most foreigners and their governments as suspect at best, murderous terrorists at every other time. The script is so clunky it feels as if no line was aimed higher than an 8 year-old's intellect. ""I know what it's like to lose someone,"" comforts one character. ""His scores are off the charts - I think he's ready,"" sounds another. Wow, they really stretched for the thesaurus on that one. Bargain basement stuff. What Michael Keaton, someone who has recently regained such cultural cache, is doing in something so crassly derivative is beyond me. This is Taken for the Trump era, refitted without the charm of that film or the presence of someone like Neeson to carry it off. Should be one star.

It's rough. It's angry. If it had less cuts, it'd be like a Daredevil fight scene, like a scripted boxing match. The stylistic choices, from the blood and gore lingering throughout the movie to the score being a bit understated, it didn't feel flashy.The actual plot is pretty blah, feels like a season worth of twists and turns, it actually reminds me of a Tom Clancy thriller, not in details, but in pacing. Like I was reading a shorthand of a full book. I've never read the series, I'm not a fan of the musings of the aggro white male, but the movies are always so violent and stylized so I watch them.This feels more like a look into how James Bond actually is: a violent man beating and killing people to solve his problems. Some people didn't like that, I certainly felt like he was unhinged throughout the movie, but that's the point. That's what this world wants in a political assassin: someone who we can deny we have ties to because they're so clearly deranged.I'm giving it an 8/10. Because it's fun, the actors liked it, Keaton was great, O'Brien was amazing and I love his range so far, I wish him the best from his continued recovery from his accident to his future projects.

161,rolandjordaan2,American Assassin - Spoiler Free Review,4,14 September 2018,"I actually watched this movie a few days ago, and since then I've really just been trying to think of anything to say about it. We've seen this story a thousand times before, some hotshot, arrogant kid is recruited by the (insert government agency here); a veteran is assigned to train him, the kid proves himself incapable of following command, thereby making himself a liability to everyone around him, yet when the mission comes, they take him along anyway and shenanigans ensue. So let me first talk about the things that I liked, because there are actually things about this movie that work well: firstly, and most importantly, Michael Keaton. I'm ashamed to admit, in the past, I had never taken much notice of Keaton as a actor, I always knew about him, obviously, but the few things I did see him in I just always found to be underwhelming films; it was only after seeing his amazing performance as The Vulture in 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' that I started taking notice of him and, here too, he is by far the best part of this film. His character is brutal, yet likable and every word he says, every facial expression he makes, I was interested in this character. Without him, this movie would have been a complete and utter fail. Taylor Kitsch, another actor I've always liked, also does a fine job as the villain; sure his character is a complete cliche, but it's kinda fun trying to see him do something with it. Another thing I want to mention specifically is the action; the action here is actually really good, it's fast paced, the fighting brutal and surprisingly gory, actually let me talk about that too; we're living in a era where even horror movies are being toned down to avoid R ratings and to leave way for a larger and younger audience, this movie does NOT care about that. We have scenes of people being burnt via blowtorch, closeups of nails being pulled out, feet getting impaled to floors...I've watched all the Italian Cannibal films, and even I will admit, there were a few seconds in this movie that made me cringe, and I actually would have respected this movie a lot for doing that: if they had known where to stop. The gore and blood splatter here gets so over the top at times that it enters 'Kill Bill' territory, but while 'Kill Bill' was intentionally filmed that way as a homage to classic and over-the-top martial arts films, here they kinda just doing it, because they can and in a movie with as little sense of humour as this, it just looks wildly out of place. And that brings me to why this movie doesn't work: lack of logic and consistency, i.e. it's really just a stupid film. Our lead character, portrayed by Dylan O'Brien, is able to track down the world's most wanted criminals in just a couple of months, by himself, with no training, why does the FBI or CIA even exist?? Btw, he is also the worst character in this movie, he's smug, at times annoying, gets tons of people killed and the worst part is, he never has a moment of redemption, he never learns anything from his mistakes. Beyond that though, Dylan O'Brien just isn't that great of an action star, sure some of his fighting scenes are impressive, but I would much rather have cast Taylor Kitsch as the lead here, hell, they even look somewhat alike in this film, so why didn't they? Overall, this movie just doesn't seem to knows what it wants to be, lol it actually turns into a disaster movie in the last 15 minutes. And also, without getting into spoilers, this movie has the absolute worst and just plain dumbest closing scene I have seen in a movie all year, I kinda just sat there with my mouth gaping open, wondering if I had just been Punked. Summing up, I'm not going to say avoid this movie at all costs, because, at the very least, I was never bored by it, but go in there knowing what to expect, a cliched action film, with zero logic, an unlikable lead and a nonsensical plot that just so happens to be kinda fun at times.",American Assassin

And they wonder why box office takings are down these last couple of years. The story line starts out believable enough - terrorists attack that kills a loved one and a survivor looking for revenge. Formulaic but watchable. The CIA, as usual in US movies of this type, appear far more successful in surveillance and covert action than is often the case in real life. The cast are OK and handle their roles well for the most part, putting aside the usual cliché or three re CIA/Special ops agents in the field. I found the movie acceptable right up to the ending where the bad guy sets out to Nuke the US Fleet. Nothing about that part of the story line was in the least bit believable. It may well have played out much better in the original book upon which the movie was based but fails miserably here. A wasted $20.

It's not done on the scale, with the acting prowess, or with the budget of the latter. The backdrops (In some scenes) are ridiculous, and downtown Tripoli looks more like downtown Birmingham.The acting is well done, and the effects are believable.

166,cochrandarin,"This is NOT a dadgum book, it's a movie...and it's pretty dadgum good!",10,28 December 2018,"I have read books and then watched movies, or vice versa. I have seen some movies that were not true to the book at all...ie; Go read Stephen King's 'The Shining' then watch the original movie with Jack Nicholson. They are waaaaay different. Was I upset? Was I offended? Did I want to get on a review site and crucify it? No, no and no!
Why is it that people feel some sort of sacrilege has been committed if a movie isn't true to the book? Holy cow...I didn't read the book for American Assassin, nor do I plan too, but if I would have and they were different, I would not get on a MOVIE review site and stone it. Anyway, rant over about that.
Ignore the negative reviews...this movie rocks. The special effects are incredible. The shooting scene at the beginning is disturbing and very realistic and will leave you with your mouth hung wide open for several minutes.
Some have blasted the movie, because they take a guy that has 'self-trained' and turned him into a CIA assassin, instead of getting a Navy SEAL or Green Beret or something. Uh, if they would have watched the movie, Sanaa Lathan's character explains this; Trained terrorists will spot 'boot camp trained' operatives a mile away. She is looking for someone who can kill without the 'soldier boy' mentality or the military aura.
So, anyhow, it works. The whole movie works. This might be Keaton's best roll ever. Lathan feels a little too nice and out of place to be the head of Orion, the mythical assassin team, but she kinda felt that way in Alien vs Predator too....you just have to overlook her sweet little smile and cute little turned up nose that makes her face a little too cute. But alas in a way, this kinda helps us swallow down the fact that they can take a guy that doesn't really have the military background and look the part (he's early twenties, not particularly big and burly) and unleash his rage and train him to become a killing machine.
Spoiler here, but some have also stoned the atomic explosion scene at the end...saying it's not 'realistic' or whatever. Gees....did Sheriff Brody shooting the tank in Jaws mouth look a little far-fetched? Quit with the ridiculous critique and watch the dadgum movie....the climax with the nuke explosion is awesome and will having you gripping your significant other's hand or couch arm until it cuts off the circulation!
I leave any wood-be critics with the same advice I usually leave you with, in the hopes that some day, I can convert every movie watcher in the world and educate you/them on what it really means to be 'entertained'...
No, this will not be the best movie you have ever seen!
No, it will not win any Oscars, I don't think.
Yes, it was a unrealistic in some places, but what action movies are not?

Plus I knew nothing about the main actor and I've never seen his work; seems like an actor for the younger demo. And that probably explains why this movie did not do too well in the box office and that's a shame.So, I saw this movie on DVD available for $5.99 at Book Off. So, I figured I was curious and at a cheap price let me check it out. Man, I was amazingly surpised how awesome this film is. It is basically a love song to Jason Bourne; same storyline or close to it where the main actor's girlfriend is killed and he now is set on revenge. If anything, it's their version of the Bourne Supremacy. I love Jason Bourne, I love the action, adventure espionage movies and that is what American Assassin is. Fun, action packed, intense. Michael Keaton is awesome as the ex-marine now serving as a teacher to Dylan O'Brien's Rapp character.People slept on American Assassin.

174,rs403404,You're killing me: Clichés ruin 'American Assassin',4,3 October 2017,"I cannot think of a single major release to come out for which I didn't see a trailer; as a critic, trailers are an occupational hazard. Yet this movie, which was released in over 3000 theaters, flew completely under my radar. In hindsight, under my radar may have been where it should have stayed. American Assassin though not a terrible movie, isn't by any stretch of the imagination good.It starts out with two young lovers on the beach (Dylan O'Brien and Charlotte Vega) who are soon to be engaged. Consequently, since this is an action movie, we know these two can look forward to a long happy life together (yes, that is sarcasm). Honestly, the moment feels so cliché that the girl should be wearing a bullseye on her bathing suit. Naturally, this scenario sets O'Brien's character (Mitch Rapp) down the path of revenge; he goes rogue; he does the job no one else can do; he gets his hands dirty; every other hackneyed cliché you can use to describe this type of character applies equally well. Eventually, he is captured by the CIA who, instead of putting him in a high security prison, recruit him, then they place him under the tutelage of the tough as nails, gruff Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton). He's a man who knows the dark side and won't put up with guff from kids who won't obey orders. Without question, Keaton's performance is the best part of the film. Nevertheless, his character is sadly enough, also, a cliché.Predictably, there's an old student of Hurley's (Taylor Kitsch) who's gone ""off the reservation"" that Hurley's new student, Rapp, will have to takedown, giving the movie clichés #47 & 48. Collect them all!A compelling character named Annika, who trains with Rapp under Hurley, seems to have quite a fascinating history, but, of course, the movie drops anything interesting. There's also a storyline where Rapp has to let go of his revenge and just focus on his mission. Does he overcome this obstacle? The movie doesn't say, but I would guess no, because that would require character development and character development is hard work.Quite frankly, I'm bashing this movie way harder than I should be. It's not completely terrible and it certainly isn't ten worst movies of the year material. It's just so what's the word? Oh yeah, cliché.",American Assassin

Nothing we haven't seen before, but told stylishly and at an unrelenting pace that kept me entertained. O'brien's brooding intensity paired with Keaton's veteran savvy made for an easy to root for mixture on screen. The movie jumps around in various beautifully shot middle eastern and European locales. And for a cast of mainly unknowns, the acting felt real.The negatives- As noted, no cliché is spared from the international thriller genre. A hero who we allow to disregard orders because of his extraordinary abilities, a nuke, an FBI director with no charisma, a completely pointless boob shot, and a fist fight on a boat because we all know that international terrorism involving nukes is always decided by hand-to-hand combat.To me, still worth seeing, even though predictable and the outcome was never in doubt. 6/10",American Assassin

The filmmakers have tried their hardest to get you to understand what makes Mitch Rapp such an efficient assassin but with limited time it doesn't quite work and he just comes off a bit aloof and arrogant (in the books you can understand his motivations a lot better which makes him a much more badass character).

He's on top of the world. ""I'm gonna get a drink,"" he tells her. ""I'll be right back."" In a movie that's almost a guaranteed cue for disaster.Eighteen months later from an Internet connection in Providence, R.I., a now bearded Rapp, with great chutzpah, texts Muslim Adnan Al-Mansur that he's ""ready to go on vacation""—code for jihad—in a cell the CIA has been unable to penetrate. He gets intercepted by Irene Kennedy, Deputy Director in charge of counter­terrorism who remarks, ""I like your agenda."" She enlists him in the elite Orion Unit, against the objection of her colleagues, telling them, ""This one is different. What happened to him on the beach that day changed him. You can't train that into some­one."" He's to be trained by ex-Navy Seal Stan Hurley (Michael Keaton.)In Marion Boyars's 1963 short story, ""The Island"", he writes—as quoted from his Collected Prose (NY: Marion Boyars, 1984)—""If people could be taken apart success­fully, inside there would be a complexity of jutting hooks, and places for such hooks to fit into, and what people consider as relation­ships would be the fact of a complement of such hooks and places, fitting together, until some external shake or jarring pulled them apart."" Rapp whose girl was torn from him now loves to get his hooks into the terrorists, with consummate success, but his coach has to tell him never to let it get personal but to rely on his training, a lesson the rest of the team needs to heed as well.This lesson is applicable to a broad range of life experiences and has even been put into a proverb: (Prov. 28:26) ""He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered."" In this nail-biter of an action movie, we mentally urge on the good guys while being all too cognizant of this common problem they face.""American Assassin"" is tightly plotted with realistic action and an easy to follow plot, even with its big stakes.

There's a scene where the main character stops running, it turns to a terrorist shooting people off camera, then it turns back and for some reason he is just standing there ready to take a shot to the leg? Why did he stop on our, oh yeah, bad acting and it was scripted he needed to be shot in the leg. Also he is in 4th the swimming pool and bodies and bullets are flying around him from above, he comes out and no terrorists were there and t HD em pan left t kg ry are still advancing from that direction as how did they shoot down into the pool they hadn't even got to yet? Also when he jumped in the pool they were shooting from the right, when he gets out they are now advancing from his left? So they ran round the beach in a circle quickly off camera? Nope again just bad editing and continuity.Then they shoot his gf point blank in the neck, she dies, he gets a shot to the shoulder, and crawls over to her. So they walk over and shoot his de as d gf and leave him alive after killing everyone else? Why, oh yeah so they still have a main character, even if it makes no sense at all. Shoot the pretty white girl who is no threat, leave the angry man still crawling in the sand alive after two gun shots??Then 35 minutes in after many other minor laughable moments. Like Keaton saying people think you slice a neck like this, and then demonstrates nothing, but no you do it like this, then demonstrates. What was the first one then genius? Another section cut out. Then in the same section, they are grabbing on the floor, Sean Atkins is on top chocking the main character, we focus on Keaton as he says a line, it moves back and for some reason Sean Atkins is now being chocked out in a sleeper hold by the main character within seconds? Another section cut out but continuity nof fixed.So the 35 minute in scene, fake shopping mall made for training with airsoft guns. He sees the target and accomplice on Sean Atkins, he draws a knife, then it cuts to another camera view and his hand is empty and he draws his airsoft pistol and takes put the two targets.

Emotion tests and off the charts, are these charts still so crap and limited that they can't measure anything better then what they already have?And how is he off the charts in everything, all his montage he is on his own, no MMA training he just does it on his own, no gun training, he is just at a range in his own. He dropped out of school 3 times so has no intelligence but somehow before his gf was killed they said he was graduating from college, but still never did as dripped out to kill terrorists.Horrible premise, horrible backstory, horrible acting, horrible filming, horrible continuity.Also everytime I saw Taylor kitsch I thought he looked like Timothy oliphant, and then when he started trying to act, I wished it was oliphant as he was just as crap in 4th his as he was in True Detective as the gay in denial.Don't waste your time watching this...",American Assassin

Dylan O'Brien (The Maze Runner and MTV's Teen Wolf) plays C.I.A. trainee Mitch Rapp. You'll be amazed at the transformation of O'Brien as he buffs up to play the stone cold killer in American Assassin. The movie is based on the best selling novels of Vince Flynn and directed by Michael Cuesta, who also directs the TV series Homeland. O'Brien's character, Mitch Rapp, becomes a lone wolf who is obsessed with revenge after terrorists kill his girlfriend while they are on vacation on a small island in the Mediterranean. He trains for a year in MMA and with weapons. He is so ruthless that he is kicked out of both his martial arts class and his weapons training class. His plans are to pose as an American who is sympathetic to the cause of Isis so he can get near enough to kill members of their terrorist cells.While he's making his plans he also being watched by the C.I.A. and they extract him from his first mission in Libya and offer him a chance to be a part of a super secret and elite black ops team. Sanaa Lathan plays Irene Kennedy, a C.I.A. Deputy Director who is in charge of the black ops team and Michael Keaton (who looks fantastic at age 66) is a former Navy Seal who's in charge of training the team. As an ensemble the actors make for a very entertaining movie. Keaton and his team travel all over the world to stop a terrorist plot between Russia and Iran to build a nuclear weapon. On the mission the team discovers a former black ops team member, only known as ""Ghost"", who is now a mercenary and is brokering the deal between the two countries. ""Ghost"", played by Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) is a former protegee of Keaton who's now seeking revenge against his former mentor and against The United States, a country who he feels betrayed him.While the cast is strong, it's O'Brien who carries the movie. He's on par with any former actor who's played James Bond except, unlike the Bond characters, he doesn't play his part with any humor or sarcasm. He plays it full out serious. He's a man obsessed with violence and killing, which makes for a very bloody and intense movie. American Assassin is rated a very strong ""R"" for violence and it has a run time of 1 hour and 51 minutes. It will keep you enthralled and on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

Set pieces are poorly written and unconvincing, even though production designing is quite decent.Lead Dylan O'Brien has decent presence as an action hero. He may eventually be able to build a decent career of the kind if he lands the right projects. Michael Keaton is polished as ever but his talents are wasted here. Rest of the actors are unremarkable.

198,reaver80808-552-7999,Generic,5,4 October 2018,"Upon seeing the trailer for this movie, I expected a gritty, twisting action thriller. What I got was a very generic action movie, and not a great one at that.The movie starts well. We are faced with a traumatic event, reminiscent of recent real world terror attacks. It is all handled well and is really quite visceral and frightening.
We are next presented with a protagonist bent on plotting revenge and destruction. So far, so good.It's just after this point, that it all starts to fall apart. It quickly switches gear to training montages, that in all honesty, don't look particularly challenging. Montages that jump from a secluded cabin in the woods to a high tech training facility with some very awful AR training simulator that looks about 20 years ahead of the rest of the movie. No doubt to add some un-needed glitz to proceedings.Next up are the ""spies"" or assassins themselves. Supposedly the best of the best, trained by the best of the best. Yet somehow they are incapable of intercepting arms dealers without major incident. Incapable of choosing the right locations to intercept enemies. They generally don't seem all that capable at all! Maybe it wasn't a montage after all. Perhaps they really did only train for a day!?!Government officials bark at each other in cliched style, and on more than a few occasions the protagonist is described by others as ""the best I've ever seen"" and ""off the charts""...urghhhh! 
The same protagonist who it seems was written to be unlikable. Off the charts on arrogance perhaps?I've never seen such a tone shift in a movie before. It starts feeling very real and grounded, and quickly becomes full of scenes with unnecessarily darkened government rooms that are inexplicably full of high tech monitors showing very stylized maps and target locators.
It goes from The Bourne Identity to CSI: Miami in five minutes!Long story short, this movie is dumb. It relies heavily on characters stupidity to move the plot forward and create action, and it is filled to the brim with cliches. The villain is also your usual two dimensional, psychopath with a grudge.I've given it a score of 5 for a very simple reason. As an action, no-brainer movie. It's ok. It's worth about a 5. It's not the worst I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the best either.

200,farshadtami,Racist and irresponsible,1,30 November 2017,"I was disappointed to see some good actors and actresses in a movie that reminded me a lot with the racist and political blunders of Homeland (the TV show). I think the movie targets a certain group of US citizens that glorify violence and have little knowledge of the political and global realities. The movie also advocates for vigilantism, and explores the unrealistic fact that CIA would hire regular individuals to be operatives in the field. The only good thing about the movie was that some actors and actresses got paid for their work. I wasted my time watching their work.",American Assassin

I could hold the puke in during the unbearably cheesy engagement scene on the beach in the opening scene, which combined with the title of the movie gives it away (unless you're 3 years old) that the fiancé is going to die so the main character has an excuse to become, well, an American assassin. What I am not willing to take anymore is that after a group of men armed with automatic weapons start shooting people dead on the beach, the recently engaged girl wanders oblivious to the shooting taking place around her calling for her fiancé - yes, as predicted she gets shot and probably dies, not sure because I sopped caring and watching at this point. In my book, anyone that stupid deserves to die (Darwin awards anyone?) so in my opinion the guy's following hunt for the guys who killed his girl is unjustified because the way I see it they did him a favor. How someone who has the nerve to film something this stupid is able to get funding for such a horrible movie is beyond me, if I could give it a -10 I would, because the current rating - probably artificially raised by bots and fake profiles - is totally undeserved, this flick should be getting a 2, TOPS.",American Assassin

Michael Keaton & Dylan o' Brien acting career is already known and i kinda interested to see Dylan acting in action movies after his acting in Maze Runner series. Their acting overall is good, but i just feel a little disappointed somehow. In the beginning, they show us nice background story, character, and character building of Dylan and Keaton. Actually I really like the background character of Dylan who is really broken after the terrorism attack and really wants to make the terrorist to pay for what they have done. Its really emotional and tough. And another good point is in the beginning they show us how cool & hard to train someone to be an assassin. But then the story is too simple, it contain less emotional story so it feel like watching action movie with action only. The movie tells us a lot of different names too and sometimes it just not really important. In the end, there is no plot twist added and also no morale message. Overall, this movie is just decent and above average.

221,kamenhaven,"Utterly pointless, unoriginal and lifeless film that's completely devoid of fun",1,17 September 2017,"American Assassin is the first film I've walked out of the theatre this year. It's also the first film that I've ever seen that's had me convinced that the script was written by a computer. I was shocked to find out that this was based on a book franchise of which there are 10+ novels, because almost every scene or dialogue in the film contains a horrible and tired cliché that you've seen in any spy/ action thriller. It's as if the producers of the film typed the words ""spy movie thriller for young adults"" into a computer and it regurgitated a bunch of words describing popular plot lines from every action movie you've seen and slapped a link to Dylan O'Brien's wikipedia page on it. From the fridging of the main hero's love interest (the plot of every revenge movie ever) to the hero's lone-wolf, silent but badass demeanour (every action movie ever) to his rebellious nature against the authorities but always comes off more heroic than every single law enforcement officer in the film (every cop movie ever) to the utterly predictable villain backstory (every villain in every spy movie ever) to the unorthodox but wise mentor who the hero hates but grows to respect him (I give up) - to count the 5 out of a 100 clichés - it's as if American Assassin is trying to one-up every single one of these tropes by being a total parody of them. Like, are you really doing the beautiful-girl-treating-the-badass-hero's-wounds cliché? Really, movie?All of this is further exacerbated by the completely lifeless and lackluster direction. The plot is pedestrian, derivative and painfully boring to watch. The action lacks tension and is shot horribly, with really lazy choreography and terrible editing. Visually, the film looks very ugly and desaturated all the time. As for performances, this movie was so bad it made Michael Keaton looked like a bad TV actor. The worse is the complete lack of charisma from the two leads Dylan O'Brien and Taylor Kitsch. Their characters are so boring to watch and every line from their mouth makes me want to barf. Once again, Hollywood commits the big sin of casting cult-favorite DTV action and martial-arts superstar Scott Adkins - who has proved he has more charisma and athletic talent than most living action movie stars today - and given him absolutely nothing to do and no spotlight to shine under.This is one of the laziest movies I've ever seen, and possibly the most forgettable movie of 2017. I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone, because there's not a single aspect that's redeeming about it. It is a complete waste of time, the equivalent of watching two hours of paint on a wall dry. If you're reading this review then I might as well recommend some great films of this ilk that you should be watching. Donnie Yen's Killzone 1 and Tony Jaa's Killzone 2 (also called SPL1/2) & The Thieves (2012 Korean movie) are great. Scott Adkins Undisputed 3 and Boyka: Undisputed are two of the best martial arts movies ever made and makes full use of the actor's talents. Peter Berg's Patriot's Day.

The implication seemed to be that he as just driven by ""cold rage"" and that this is what gave him his skills but all the fight scenes were edited to be close and so we never get to see him doing anything to show his hand/hand or knife combat skills.Secondly, all the people at various levels of power had a very one-dimensional ""I have dealt with everything and anything for years and don't have a drop of internal/emotional conflict"" expressed either though their body language or language. Compare this with something like ""Homeland"" where all the characters are basically showing more and more how messed up they are inside because of what they've been through.Third and this is just a personal gripe: Scott Adkins who is an incredibly skilled martial artists was completely wasted and watching ""Mitch"" take down ""Yuri Boyka the greatest fighter in the world"" was just heresy.Fourth and probably most importantly, it was just a boring movie.",American Assassin
225,gnokial-59688,A better than average film.,10,23 September 2018,"I watched this film on Netflix, not in the cinema. Yes I said cinema instead of theatre because to us Brits, a cinema is for film-showing, a theatre is for live performances. And I am glad I did, because I had to rewind some parts to establish the political who's who. I don't consider myself a film critic because I don't want to stress myself out reliving the bad films. I'm writing this review as a feed back to the film-makers so that, hopefully, they won't make the same pitfalls. So I go:1. There weren't many boring moments except from the swimming pool to the sandy side of the beach. Although I appreciate that it was probably done to establish the trait of the main character, but there are plenty of opportunity in the show to do that instead of dragging a scene. The other long drawn scene was watching a man lying on the bed doing nothing, possibly asleep.2. Not enough time is devoted to introducing the other characters - I'm not good at remembering faces or names that I have no idea how to spell or pronounce while I'm busy following what is going on in the plot. Trying to establish who the baddies are and what are their agenda was like attempting to take photos of a tree or a house from inside a fast-moving train.3. Featuring a black female on the top of the command chain is nice, I embrace racial and gender equality. However, someone in this important role wearing a pair of stiletto and a wig is not really believable. I'm sure this prejudice about how someone dresses for a role isn't just mine, given the bad press about what the current wife of the 47th presidents has been showing up for official visits.4. My last point is more to do with marketing. When we saw the film's title American Assassin, both my partner and I straight away thought that we have already seen this movie, for we have seen many films beginning with ""American"", surely we must have seen this one. Had I not subsequently gave it a chance by perusing the preview in IMDb, we would never have added this title to our list of movies to watch on Netflix.Despite the above, I'm happy to say I came away with satisfaction that I had been entertained after watching the show. My favourite part, without being specific and have to issue a spoiler warning, was seeing all the big water movement and chaos on the ocean, which are very well done, in my unsophisticated view anyway. I think all the actors and actresses acted convincingly (despite the wig and high heel shoes). I think this film deserves a higher rating than the current average of 6.2, so I give it a ten with the aim to lift the average so that maybe less people will get put off by insufficiently high ratings.",American Assassin

229,briancseel,Someone Turn Mitch Rapp Loose on Whoever Wrote This Script,1,18 January 2018,"Imagine, a popular series of action novels that have sold over 15 million copies that Hollywood feels pressure to option the film rights for. But the novels take, shall we say a conservative world view, and Hollywood doesn't really want to make the movie. So they sit on the rights for years until they are about to expire and then a bean counter prods them to get cameras rolling so they don't lose their investment. Throw in a need for meaningless diversity in casting and there you go.This is the movie that you get when you follow that process. What's really scary, there are 4 names attached to the screenwriting for this movie. You would think with 4 people in the room somebody could have come up with a better idea than this.I am a huge fan of the Vince Flynn novels and this could have well been a new action franchise for Hollywood. Their first mistake was trying to jam origin story together with another stand alone book (or books - I've read the series and this plot is a hodgepodge of multiple titles). They had ZERO room for character development. However much you care about Mitch Rapp before you see the film is exactly how much you will care AFTER you see the film.Without character development the film becomes a 105 minute hodge podge of random action sequences. Only because I have read the books could I fill in the blanks. The second mistake was introducing important characters like Thomas Stansfield or Dr. Frank that you had ZERO time to develop. You don't care about anyone in this movie and if you haven't read the books I am pretty sure that most of the time you have no idea what is going on.They got the casting half right. Dylan O'Brien is a good choice as Mitch Rapp and if he had been given ANYTHING to work with might have been able to craft an interesting character. Micheal Keaton is close as Stan Hurley, and he does his best, although Bruce Willis (who was interested in the role at one point) would have been a better choice. But Irene Kennedy reads in the book like a Gwynneth Paltrow role and they cast an African-American actress who can't pull it off. Thomas Stansfield should have been Donald Sutherland, slam dunk, and instead they cast a shorter, younger, more ethnic actor. That is probably irrelevant since they did nothing with the character. From there you are clear on Mitch Rapp's motivation (to kill terrorists) and not much else. Bizarre training sequences are rushed through so we can get Rapp into the field. Unfortunately the case he is working on is not much clearer, nor do we fully understand who is in his posse (she seems like CIA, but then she is working for the Iranians, but not the bad Iranians, and then she is dead).There are daylight assaults (because we can't afford to shoot at night), unexplained locations (are we under a high school?), shoddy spy craft, etc. A terrible movie and it is sad Hollywood will use the poor box office results to justify walking away from a great series of books. The reality is they mailed it in and tanked this because they didn't like the politics.",American Assassin
230,ronnietg,American Assassin,7,8 October 2017,"As a Vince Flynn fan, I put that aside and just enjoyed the film version. I think that with some fixes, this script could have gone from just good to memorable, over the top: The first few minutes deal with the Hero and the love of his life at a beach resort in the water, sun sparkling, etc. We know that there will soon be a blood bath of some sort and it is almost certain that the girl will be killed so as to give the Hero a motive for revenge to find the murderers and kill them.So, to transcend this predictability, the Hero should have been released from prison after doing petty theft, having been in and out of institutions all of his life ever since his parents were killed in an automobile accident when he was 14. The aforementioned Back Story is revealed to the audience when the C.I.A. goes through his file and just mentions these facts offhandedly. This Hero is a flawed Hero if he is introduced in the above manner. He is finally cleaning up his act; he's taking the big step and asking the girl for her hand in marriage. He has buffed up in prison already. This will be the set up for the pay off of seeing him transform into an action Hero bent on revenge.As it stands, the Hero grieves the sudden loss of a loved one and by the end of Act 1, he determines revenge on the Islamic group that murdered her. However, revenge as a goal/desire for a Hero is short-lived and difficult to play out for a 120 minute story line. After a Hero puts the bad guy out of his misery, where does the story have to go? Here, the story line got off track. Michael Keaton, brilliant actor as usual, starts out as the Point of View character, the mentor. But as the plot unravels, the new opponent comes into the story line. This new ""bad guy"" is not out for the Hero. He is gunning for the point of view character. This is problematic for the Narrative Drive and slows down what could have been an even better Action/Thriller story. Michael Keaton is given more play with the lowest point in the script, which should have gone to the Hero. There's a punch-counter-punch between the new opponent and the point-of-view character that should have occurred between the opponent and the Hero. The result is a reactive Hero who is motivated by revenge - This should have been written as a proactive Hero who is motivated not only by revenge, but by getting involved for the first time in his life with bringing down people who want to murder other people because of radical Islamic ideology. To honor the beautiful woman who was killed so senselessly, he decides to step up and go after the cell even though he has a self-revelation at the end that it's simply impossible for one man to ""get all the bad guys"" in the world - but at least one has to try. The power of this story would have been much greater had the character been written this way.In addition to the aforementioned script problems, the lead Hero was good, but not believable. Yes, he did buff up, but this actor should have been the demented Ghost and the demented Ghost or new opponent should have been the Hero. This is a casting decision, and I'm sure there will be many who disagree with what I'm saying. Ramping up the stakes with the possibility of a nuclear explosion killing thousands of humans was okay, but the main point of any great story is the character arc of the hero. The plot is a mirror of the Hero's character arc. That is why revenge as a motive is not forceful enough. The Hero and the new opponent going head to head would have strengthened his character arc and the nuclear aspect would not have seemed as if it was tacked onto the story line as a contrivance.",American Assassin
231,walter2-407-597390,Very enjoyable version of Vince Flynn's book,9,17 September 2017,"I am baffled by some of the low reviews, this has a few plot changes to make it more current (Mitch's fiancée's death, for example), but otherwise is a very good conversion of Flynn's excellent thriller to the screen.The action scenes are very well done, and the plot has enough twists and turns to be steadily entertaining. I am not sure some plot elements can be said to be totally original, but to some degree that is because so many other stories have been derived from Flynn's books that is just seems that way. This movie production was delayed for years, and that made the material less fresh feeling than it deserved to be.My only unhappiness is the choice of actors for Mitch, he just doesn't have the right chemistry and appearance to be the character. His performance is fine, I never felt he was putting in less than his best performance, but I simply think a different person would have made for a more enjoyable finished product.I did feel I got good value for my ticket price, something I haven't been able to say very often this year, so recommended to any action film fan.",American Assassin

It was hard to deal with the flashback aspect of the story. Seeing an inept young Rapp after all of the books where he was a super efficient cold blooded killer. I was so unimpressed by the book the I actually bought it twice totally forgetting that I had read it already.This movie was good. Dylan was a good choice for the dark haired Rapp and perfect for the flashback aspect of seeing Rapp as a very young inexperienced and mad man. Worst part of the book was the a hole attitude of Hurley. It was like I am going to teach you to be a killer by making you want to kill me. Some of that was there in the movie but toned down so it didn't dominate the story.Didn't see the cliches everyone is talking about. There are only so many angles on terrorism stories and they made nice twists on some of those.Overall very good and I would like to see more if they can show Rapp maturing and getting hold of his emotions like he does in the earlier books.",American Assassin

Muslims don't hate Jews. The list goes on... please bring something new and original to the table. How about the tables flip for a change? The world is innocent and the US is the enemy? Perhaps it's other religions/faiths that are at guilt? Maybe victimize the Middle East/Muslims for once? No?? I thought so.

238,NikiSarah,"Orion, The Hunter, son of Poseidon",10,21 September 2017,"I found it curious that they keep naming special-ops programs that train former Navy SEALS as Orion. (Looking at you, Blindspot!) Apparently, the mythology is that Orion was the son of Poseidon (god of the sea) and he had the ability to walk on water and was a great hunter. Seems fitting!The newest member of Orion is Mitch Rapp, and Dylan O'Brien embodies the character so well that you would never think a year ago he played a high school kid in Teen Wolf. Everyone loves his sarcastic, maverick character in Teen Wolf (really, he became the star more than the main character) and I kept looking for flashes of this character he's played so long to show up in Mitch, but they were nowhere to be found. Even in the two instances where he cracks a joke, it's filtered through the terrible experiences that Mitch went thru.He's serious, in fact more serious than Bond or Bourne. Maybe that's because of the R rating. But I think it's because this movie (franchise?) is more grounded and relatable to current events. Bond seems to be in a parallel universe - with over-the-top villains, futuristic gadgets, and a British sense of humor that makes you feel like things really aren't that bad. Bourne is more grounded but the whole franchise he's trying to figure out what happened to his life.Mitch Rapp, even though this was the origin story, is more about a cause greater than himself. His revenge plan is more serious than the other two. Maybe some people think Rapp and co. took themselves too seriously for an action movie, but I think it was a refreshing change.",American Assassin

247,jaredstarva,A pretty fun and intense action film,9,12 April 2021,"This movie is nothing that will blow your socks off narratively, but for the most part, it is pretty well grounded. We follow the story of a recently engaged man that tries to hunt down terrorists after losing his would-be wife in an attack. From there, we get into the nitty-gritty of world affairs, the CIA, and a specialized training force aimed at creating brutally efficient assassins. Each idea feels like it has room to breathe and the characters are mostly likeable.The main draw, of course, is the action, which looks stellar! Serious money was dumped into this aside from the celebrity casting and it shows! Everything from the car chases, hand to hand combat, gunplay, etc. It all combines together wonderfully. All the action in this movie builds up to an amazing climax. This film knows how to nail pacing and it never blows its load early. The music was gorgeous too, especially during the climax.Acting isn't usually a thing that people expect to be good out of a straight action flick like this, but this movie does have capable people in front of the cameras who give it their all.All in all, I don't see why this movie gets such a bad score. My only guess is that it might be based on a book or something like that and people hate it for that sole reason (which is a very narrow-minded view that limits creativity). Everything came together to create an exciting 2 hour epic! I can only imagine how fun this must've been for Dylan O'Brien to record.",American Assassin

Well, the puzzle pieces in the film are all the wrong pieces shoved together in all the wrong spots. I want to like this film, the actors played their parts well, but the constantly shifting plot make the bewildered viewer lose all interest.

261,stickman007,Much better than the usual PG-13 Hollywood yawn - fest.,8,18 September 2017,"I'll start by saying that sometimes this spy/terrorist/revenge genre can seem a bit stale but after watching this effort by director Michael Cuesta I was very entertained.My own belief is that while Hollywood has the biggest budgets on these types of movies it is consistently last, IMO, in marking all the ""action"" check-off list boxes. For the absolute finest in cinematic violence and realism look no further then the products coming out of Asia. I first was hooked by HK cinema and directors like John Woo and Tsui Hark back in the nineties. Nowadays my favorite studio is Well-Go. Stars like Donnie Yen, Tony Jaa and Iko Uwais are my benchmark in ""Action Cinema"" and ASSASSIN comes the closest to pleasing my blood stained palate of any U.S. production in a long time.Regarding the cast, Dylan O'Brien is probably very close in age to the actual character. At first he resembles a typical urban millenial yuppie type but his transformation to a psychotic professional killer is believable in mind as well as body. Props also to a ripped Michael Keaton who appears to be about forty years old (he is 66). No disrespect, but Tom Cruise and Matt Damon are probably the least able (physically and age-wise speaking) to portray their characters of Jack Reacher and Jason Bourne. ASSASSIN also contains some righteous R rated death dealing almost on par with the recent offerings from Asia such as THE BERLIN FILE or HEADSHOT. Fight fans can rejoice at the long shots and excellent choreography involved in ASSASSIN as well. The BOURNE series (for example) contained mostly headache inducing close-up flash editing. Matt Damon even admitted in print that he did not excel in hand to hand combat and relied heavily on the editing involved. Other recent action offerings like THE EXPENDABLES franchise are pretty much a carnival barkers promise to bring back the magic of the eighties.Finally, tho the output of this genre is admittedly high the plots can still be topical. Right now (September 2017) we could realistically be involved in a shooting war with North Korea. The country of Iran is well into production of nuclear weapons with which they publicly vow to destroy an already nuclear equipped Israel. Meet Julian Assange, he will pay you big bucks to tell him what happened to Seth Rich. Meanwhile hundreds of civilians worldwide (but mostly in Europe) have died this year in bombings, shootings, stabbings or vehicular homicide, pretty messy. So, while ASSASSIN may not be the ""greatest"" movie on tap here,it's still pretty good and a lot better than some of the efforts starring people (not necessarily knocking any particular celebrities here) who are more frequently on a red carpet and the cover of People magazine.",American Assassin

The CIA thinks he is the holy grail for a secret assassin even though he is a loose cannon, so they send him off to some secret camp that is led by Stan (Michael Keaton). After his intense training does he make good operative? He is the most obvious spy out there. Just runs around guns blazing and does his own thing when told not to and just happens to end up in the right place at the right time. But get this, the main antagonist is a loose cannon who doesn't take orders and used to be part of the secret CIA group but has now gone rogue. So the CIA's logic is to get someone who doesn't take orders and train them up to go against the person who was trained by the CIA and didn't take their orders...The action is lame, for example there is a part where he is in a car park (where he shouldn't be) and they're dogs after him so he hides in a car. He manages to lure them in the car and locks them in. That's it. Surely this holy grail of a CIA operative would of found a better way to get to his mission that didn't cause so much of a ruckus. But all of this noise and commotion wouldn't of have even compromised his mission, as he was on the ground floor outside in a car park and his mission is like the 30th floor of a building that he is next to so why did they make this so dramatic when he wasn't in any real danger!?When they wanted to add emotion to the film they would just mention his dead fiancé and Mitch would go teary eyed or angry and that's that.I do feel like there is a great storyline here but the way the director told it is utter shambles.",American Assassin

286,iromashchenko,One more thriller about espionage,6,29 September 2017,"Firstly, I need to say that I haven't read the book before watching the movie. Rather I was more like a blank page. My expectations were fully based on trailers, movie's cast and the name of the director. In general this is not a bad movie. It is dynamic and intriguing. There is plenty of action, which is quite of good quality. The biggest value of the movie is Michael Keaton. Surely the actor manages to grasp the viewer's attention when he is in scene. He does not even need to say anything, just enough to be on screen. A great actor. However, Michael Keaton alone is not enough for a good joint. And this is where some issues emerge. Other characters clearly lack some human features. The main hero is quick and acts well in actions scenes, but he reminds more of a machine than a real person. In this regard Jason Bourne looks more natural. One of the main weaknesses of the film is that characters are not developed enough. When someone dies there, it does not make us sympathize. To the contrary, this is how fresh air is brought to the movie. Finally, one of the strangest scenes ever observed in cinema and a SPOILER ALERT. In a scene where the atomic bomb explodes under the water all electronic devices should have fried there. However, all computer equipment continues to work, including the helicopter's displays. This is where this movie ceases to be a thriller and enters territory of science fiction.",American Assassin

You have to like, or at least be able to relate to, some of the characters before engaging and this just didn't happen here. A needlessly graphic torture scene didn't help (it's removal would probably have secured the film a 15 rating in the UK) and the violence that was justified by the story was over the top and, while causing a few cuts and bruises, didn't seem to incapacitate our hero in any way.

The Stan Hurley character was the best thing in the picture.
Although the book never stated what race Ireme Kennedy was, I always pictured her as a Condeleeze Rice type. 
In the books, Irene was always a lady. She would serve tea/coffee to her associates in her office. She would NEVER use the F word. She tried to have a private life but she was so tied up with her work, it was impossible.

He wasn't exactly who I pictured in my head but he really was close enough. Michael Keaton wasn't a bad choice for Hurley either. Personally I imagines Bruce Willis in my head for that role but Keaton was a pretty solid choice.
Unfortunately, this movie was a pretty pathetic ""interpretation"" of the book. Rename the characters and call it something else and I probably would have been pleased with the outcome. I had the book in mind and obviously the writers and directors did not. It's sad too because the actual storyline of American Assassin would have done great in theaters and Flynn fans would have been excited to support a Mitch Rapp franchise.",American Assassin
299,pcamp836,"A good action film, but NOTHING like the actual book",5,20 September 2017,"Ever since I heard that a film was being made of Vince Flynn's American Assassin, I couldn't wait to see it. I've read every ""Mitch Rapp"" book there is and am a huge fan of the character. But once again, Hollywood didn't waste an opportunity to take a great book franchise and screw it up. Apart from the names of the main characters and a small scene when Mitch first meets Stan Hurley, there are no similarities to the original book. Vince Flynn must be turning over in his grave. Why was it necessary to bring the time line of Mitch Rapp up by 25 years? It would have worked had Mitch been drawn into the secret organization because his girlfriend was killed in the Lockerbie crash. It actually would have been more faithful to the inner life of the character if the movie didn't begin with Mitch losing his mind and training himself to be a killer. The thing most fans love about Mitch is that he ISN'T half-cocked. He's very thoughtful and methodical about his job and that's what makes him so effective. Mitch isn't just some crazed, emotionally driven killer. He has a job to do and he does it with effective lethal force because he takes emotion out of it. Why was it necessary to make Stan an ex-SEAL instead of an ex-CIA operative (who worked alongside Irene's dad). Speaking of which, the film totally leaves out the deep bond of affection between Stan and Irene (as well as Irene and Thomas Stanfield, who was practically irrelevant to the story in the film), and the grudging respect (which grows into friendship) between Mitch and Stan.But the thing that really tipped the scales for me is the unnecessary introduction of a rogue ex-Orion member who got mad and has a huge chip on his shoulder because no one came to get him when he was captured and subsequently tortured. WTF. The whole point of Stan and Irene being highly discriminatory in who is on the Orion Team is because they're going to be exposed to extreme danger in their mission. They would have surely ferreted out a whiny POS like Ghost in the training process. I guess H'wood felt it was necessary to have the evil American in the film to show that the Islamist terrorists are all warm and fuzzy compared to an American psycho.On its own, the film was a decent action film and had a story that moved along. The actors were all good in their roles. However, as a Vince Flynn-inspired film, it sucked. If you're not going to use the characters and stories that made him a bestselling author, then why bother at all? I hope if they make a sequel they will stay truer to the stories told by Flynn (and now his successor in the franchise, Kyle Mills).",American Assassin

That is why I really looked forward to ""American Assassin"" as it had a really interesting movie trailer.Sadly, the actual movie left much to be desired in both the action and story department. Honestly, we have another one of those jingoist movies similar to American Sniper (another disappointing film)that portray a majority of people in the middle east as blood-thirsty killers/maniacs.The movie starts promising enough but towards the middle and latter part of the film, it becomes a yawn fest. The only notable action scenes were the intro scene and the brawl between O'Brien and Adkins. The last fight scene gave me a headache, quite frankly, I wanted to strangle the cameraman. What's up with this shaky cam bulls**t? Also,they should've cast Adkins in the title role and came up with a better script and director.I don't know any Vince Flynn books but I'm a big fan of action/thriller novels like Brotherhood of the Rose, Fraternity of the Stone, The Man from St. Petersburg, etc. and this film failed to emulate the feel or tone of those books.",American Assassin

O'Brian is about as far from Mitch Rapp as anybody could be. Don't get me wrong, he did a reasonably good job in the movie BUT HE'S NOT MITCH RAPP. Overall it's a pretty decent movie. It's entertaining for that type of film. There were a couple of scenes I could have done without. And the transition from one scene to another in a couple of places could have been more seamless. If they do make any more of Vince's books into a movie, I would hope they could find an actor who fits the Mitch Rapp character better.

It's ok to isolate yourself, arm up and train to kill the evil in the world.
In fact, the CIA is actually looking for talented rogue vigilantes!
And when they hire you, you don't need to obey orders - just continue on your self righteous gut feeling - you are the only one who knows the truth!

It's definitely not as solid as his siblings mentioned higher. Actually the opposite.Movie at the beggining deliver's fresh concept for action movie, but throw it away after several minutes which is a huge dissapointing factor. Leaving personal and more interesting concept for huge scale ""save the world"" story. Saying that, personal revenge is over used in more than half of the action movies. However, this could be more interesting ""avenging his beloved"" plot. Story fails rapidly from something more interesting to a typical American movie.Action is shown more than in other flicks which is always great and it is good to see that directors in recent movies are going this path of showing us what is happening instead of hiding actors incapabilities. That being said, don't expect action worth of John Wick.Leading actors making the characters more believable. Michael Keaton is great on set and Dylan O'Brien in a main role as a more newer face in action deliver a character that is highly interesting most of the screen time.Other characters are however, forgettable.Reviews slightly burn the movie down, but try to give it a chance.

I'll start off with Dylan - I did not buy him as Mitch, he didn't seem to play it consistently. Granted, Mitch is grieving but all the sides we see of him - sarcastic, defiant, strong, weak. It all just seemed to me like Dylan wasn't sure how to play it and it turned into a mess. I believe book Mitch Rapp is supposed to be badass and Dylan just didn't show me this. I did not view him as kickass, scary or relentless, but rather just a little boy who is a wannabe. This is just my opinion and I believe if someone else was cast it could've been MUCH better. Even if it was Scott Adkins. I question if Dylan read the books or not? But good on him for giving it a go... Michael Keaton nailed it as usual. Taylor Kitsch was hit and miss. Sometimes he was God awful, other times descent; but never once did he impress me with his acting. Not as much as Keaton who didn't even look like he was trying (in a good way).The story was completely Hollywood-ified. It was generic and rushed. I hated it. They were trying to fit in way too much and there was barley any meaning to it, so I did not feel invested into this world or the characters. The action was okay but at times it looked very rehearsed and I didn't see any rawness that I like to see in film fights. The best fight was definitely the one at the end but it still felt rushed. And what was that atrocious CGI?!Watch this if it's on the TV and you have nothing better to do. Don't be fooled though - the start is brilliant and the rest of the film is not.

It was fun to watch him evolve into a cold-blooded killing machine. Taylor Kitsch is OK as the villain. I've seen people complain online about how this movie doesn't follow the book, but I've never read any of the Mitch Rapp books, so maybe that's one of the reasons I enjoyed it more than others did. It's no Jason Bourne and I don't think this is a movie you can watch more than once, but I'd certainly check out a sequel if they choose to make one. It was a fairly auspicious debut for the Mitch Rapp character on the big screen.6/10",American Assassin

4) Right after Syria invasion by USA in just a couple of years, around 5 million Syrian arabs and other millions of arab people from other Middle East countries settled in Turkey by courtesy of Turkish government colaborating with USA government as a part of the american GMEP in order to getting Turkey arabic.
5) Beginning from potus until the most little governor manager director whatsoever should write in their minds in the hardest form that Turkish people will never be like arabs.

As such, his character is intense, befitting the novel it was based on. Taylor Kitsch plays ""ghost,"" and he works really well opposite Keaton and O'Brien.

Afterwards Matt (the main character) throw off is life and go on a quest to avenge his wife death. The movie shows how he tracks the terrorist and train for killing them. The start is very promising, and it does a decent job in drowing the viewer's attention. Then it all goes downhill. The CIA for some reason is monitoring Matt. Some how they got to know him, and they want to recruit him. Matt goes to the terrorist cell and the CIA shows up, and bomb the scene. Then they do recruit him. This plot change is somewhat crap, not believable narrative because government agencies don't operate that way. And why THE FUC* the CIA would monitor a random guy in the first place. Then in the greater scheme they want to train Matt to be agent and aid in nuclear weapon gone to the wrong hand. To do so, they transfer him to these navy seal veteran for evaluation and training. This part of the movie is so cliché and pathetic. First of all that veteran guy look more like a plastic surgeon or patient than an ex army soldier. Furthermore the training is rushed, without point and theme. Then the third phase of the movie is the actual mission where they try to retrieve the weapon. I guess it is o.k. action. They could have done a better job, with more believable mission and execution. In short, the movie could have been a 8/10 hit. The basic idea is good. Dylan as the main character does a good job. You can see he try to make the fighting scene authentic with some real life MA moves. But the CIA angle in this movie and the navy seal guy is totally BS.

348,mrdgal04,Trailer=great movie; Movie=disappointment (book reader),5,24 September 2017,"So let me get this out of the way, I started reading the book series in chronological order because of the awesome trailer and to see what the production company could come up with in sequels....well, about that. Spoilers ahead as a warning. As a book reader, I was okay with them making this more modern day story rather than age it back to the 80's and 90's when the main character was trained. The first scene was well done, definitely more violent than expected but this is rated ""R"". The dialogue could have been a bit better between characters and I understand what Micheal Keaton was trying to do with the character Stan Hurely by not being formidable physically but still having him stare at a computer screen of ""ghost"" and not really change anything there. They could of added the fact of sounds from the last time he saw ""ghost"" with Irene Kennedy calling his attention off screen, to make a better impact on that relationship. Dylan O'Brian does appear to have the acting chops to be a good action hero but what lacks is the development this movie doesn't really provide. Like one minute he is working with someone and is brought back into the CIA and at the end, they have no idea where he is and no where in the other character faces or voices makes an inkling that they do. The character development didn't really develop at all. Just a change in scene and he was an assassin. Also transitions from scenes could have been done better like when Ghost's personnel attack the room Mitch Rapp (Dylan O'Brian's character) and the other spy are in and Rapp surrenders but how does he surrender. All we see is him pointing a gun at Ghost, cut to a scene with Stan Hurely (Keaton), cut to Rapp and the other spy on their knees. Like why did Rapp surrender? Oh the big issue I have is they changed the character Victor completely. In the book he is undercover trainer for Hurely during Rapp's training and is a big part of the second book. In the movie he is a normal trainee who is likely former special ops and picks on Rapp once and doesn't play well with others it seems. Also they kill him in the movie which means if the studio breaks even ($33 million budget, as of 9/21/2017 only made $26 million) or actually gets a profit and wants to make a sequel....HOW!?! They could just skip to the third book but of course that's a bit of a time jump too. All I can say is this time the book was way better than the movie, but I'm willing to give it another shot when it comes on DVD and borrow it from the library. I'm not paying to see it again.",American Assassin

That's the case here, which is astonishing, because the book IS a good story. All they had to do was adapt it into a screenplay. Instead, almost everything is changed, with idiotic subplots and some really idiotic character choices.

354,slither5,Far better than expected!,10,5 October 2017,"I've been a Vince Flynn reader for a decade and have loved every Mitch Rapp book, so i was leery about the choice to cast such a youthful actor for the part of Mitch Rapp. I wasn't going to miss the film, but I wasn't sure I'd see it in theater or just wait until it came to streaming or small screen. However, my husband and I decided to give it a try, despite lackluster reviews, and I have to say I was very much taken with the movie, contrary to my expectations. Dylan O'Brien matured and filled out to the point where he could certainly pass for my version of a very young/green Mitch Rapp (he's lean but very muscular and his action scenes were whip-fast)... I've always thought of Rapp as average height/build, easy to underestimate, always able to blend in ... at least until he goes into motion! I thought O'Brien's facial expressions and his eyes were able to convey so much- from light-hearted youthful joy early on, to pain/rage/cynicism/cold detachment as needed throughout the film. He's a good actor and brought his A-game. And while he is easy on the eyes, he isn't a male model or unrealistically gorgeous- more of an average guy, which is how i've always pictured Rapp.Keaton was awesome as Stan Hurley, made me laugh out loud once or twice with affection for the grisly old warrior. I read several reviews here on IMDb and elsewhere by critics saying the dialogue was ridiculously simplistic, ie when Hurley says something along the lines of ""Some bad people plan on doing some bad things, and it's our job to stop 'em."" Sorry, but I think they missed the sarcasm there, and probably haven't read the books. Hurley and Rapp could hardly stand one another when they first met, and this is exactly the kind of frustrating and dismissive answer Hurley might use to shut Rapp down when he was asking questions Hurley didn't care to answer.So yeah, I bought in, and despite my early reservations, the cast won me over. I'd definitely pay again to see this franchise, though it looks like early box office results may make that unlikely. I'm crossing my fingers that I'm wrong and they'll be back, as I really do love a great action flick that doesn't shy away from R material. And now that the origin story is out of the way, I'd like to see some of those other books adapted to film. They're patriotic and full of ass-kicking. My kind of movie!",American Assassin

The major story problems were an easily predictable, clichéd plot and then a confusing message about the merits/morality of revenge vs. non-revenge.

I originally saw the trailer and it had interested me so I recently purchased the movie blindly, then checked out how the movie reviewed. Much to my dismay the reviews were incredibly poor and I almost returned the unopened box. Thankfully I was lazy and decided to stay home and watch it anyways because it is one of the most entertaining action thrillers I have seen lately. The poor reviews seem to be done by people who haven't watched the film, but what I recommend is watching the trailer and if it looks good, then rent it. If you are a fan of Michael Keaton, or Taylor Kitch then this is a Buy. Both give great performances, and work well together. I was impressed with the dynamic represented in the film of the duality between a veteran soldier who still serves his country, and of a vet who becomes warped from his tours of duty. ""America makes Monsters"" as the disturbed vet states in the film and it is the conflict between the two perspectives that crafts such an excellent film. The entire cast performs well and the fact of the matter is, the attention to detail and the respect given here is a real treat for those who have the eye for it. Weapon handling is done well, combat roles by extras and others are portrayed seriously without the wisecracking horse play commonly found in movies nowadays. The movie also crosses lines where many other films are not willing to go, playing on your expectations and keeping you engaged.

All Turkish characters were played by some non-Turkish actors and actresses, as if it was difficult to find better and truer sounding artists in Istanbul. The language was an Arabic sounding Turkish imitation with tons of mistakes. The scenes were shot as if to give an impression that the events were taking place in some arabic country. Some of the extras were intentionally made to wear costumes that are quite hard to spot in real Istanbul. Mr. Cuesta's focus had shifted to portrayal of Istanbul, a betrayal to the film.The Rome scenes, on the other hand, were testimony to the other extreme at which Mr. Cuesta has lost focus again, This time it was just for the sake of shooting tourist attractions in Rome.The whole movie is a poorly designed potpourri selected from cliché segments from similar genres.",American Assassin

3. The acting is sub-par and beneath Michael Keaton
4. It has a poor storyline and crappy pacing.In 2 words; So what? The movie has a solid premise, decent character build, and a very simple storyline. It also packs a metric butt-load of action into a little under 2 hours. Don't come into this expecting an Oscar contender, but a kick-ass action movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and delivers fist fights, espionage, explosions, car
chases, and gunfights - all the good stuff an action movie needs. I'm giving this a solid 7 as an action movie, not as a cinematic masterpiece. Come for the action, stay for the action and expect action. Enough said.",American Assassin

The answer to (a) is that it isn't even close. I am a great fan of the Mitch Rapp series and whilst I am not for a minute suggesting that the books are classical literature they are a fabulous and entertaining read. Almost nothing in this film has anything to do with any of the books. The only saving grace is that they didn't make the mistake of casting Tom Cruise (like they did to play the 6' 5"" Jack Reacher!) in the role of Mitch Rapp; I think that Dylan O'Brien did alright but i wasn't convinced - I think they could have done better but maybe so could Mr O'Brien with an even slightly passable script and director. Generally I found the casting pretty dire.
(b) Was it a good film? No. Plain and simple. It was pretty weak - even ignoring the divergence from the book.

This is Hollywood's Mitch Rapp. This is literally an ""American Assassin"" NOT Vince Flynn's ""American Assassin."" The kid they cast to portray Mitch, PLLLLLLEEEEEEAAASSSSSE! Take the time to read the interview below and you'll find Vince Flynn's PERSONAL choice for the part. 10/27/2010 Interview with Dan Gagliasso ""Most of Hollywood thinks it has a 'moral' mandate to defend the leftist status quo."" Flynn tells me with conviction. ""Their leftist bias won't allow them to do anything other then make crappy anti-American war movies where America is the bad guy."" Movies nobody goes to see. I get the strong impression that what he'd really like to say is, ""When are these snobby elitists going to get their heads out of their asses."" Flynn published his first book Term Limits fifteen years ago, and it was a runaway hit. So why hasn't even one of his twelve hugely popular novels made it the screen? He remembers with not a little irony, ""After Memorial Day was published (dealing with a possible nuclear attack by terrorists on American soil) Sherry Lansing, the head of Paramount called me and said, 'I read your book and I hated it. It's more Bush then Bush.' My response was 'Can we at least get on the same page that terrorists blowing up Washington D.C. or New York City would really be a bad thing?'""Lansing meekly agreed.CBS Films and producer Lorenzo DiBonaventura are on the verge of changing that Hollywood slight.Flynn's Consent to Kill,dealing with a high-end duo of freelance assassins hired by a revenge-seeking Saudi prince, who attempt to eliminate Mitch Rapp has been adapted by screenwriter Jonathan Lemkin.""Les Moonves at CBS purchased the feature film rights to the Mitch Rapp franchise. It's taken five years but this is a good group of people,they get it.""Says Flynn with appreciation. Antoine Fuqua of Training Day fame will direct with Gerard Butler and Eric Bana amongst others being considered as Rapp. Though he has no problem with either actor his personal choice would be Bruce Willis, ""He's a little old for the part, but he's my favorite actor and he could make it work."" Flynn has had to deal with a lot of foolish film industry types who used to come up with crazy ideas for casting the Mitch Rapp character with some left wing loon like Sean Penn. He shakes his head and gives a sardonic grin,""Like I'm going to let that happen."" Hollywood types should think more then twice before ever trying to cross this writer and his millions of dedicated fans. March 16, 2011 Robert James Bidinotto Flynn: My series has become too valuable of a commodity, so now, they are in this game of chicken. They don't agree with the books; they don't want to make a movie and have their friends give them crap. They are afraid that the Muslims might get upset if they make a movie that really goes after Islamic radical fundamentalism. But they are still looking at producing it, thinking, ""My God—business-wise, this might be a really good decision. No one has bought the rights to this damn thing yet; and he's got one of the biggest audiences of any fiction writer in the country. How much longer can we ignore him?"" TNI:Yes.

Maybe my review is a bit biased cause I'm Turkish but why is it that every time I watch a Hollywood movie that is supposed to involve a part of Turkey, I am just plain angry at the portrayal? From the first scene that was supposed to be in Turkey, I knew that it wasn't because somehow they didn't even check how our license plates look. The actors who are supposed to be Turkish are actually from Arabic countries. The level of Turkish spoken in the movie is laughable. The safe house Mitch and his boss go to is decorated in such a fashion that I haven't seen a house that ""oriental"" in Turkey since 1950s. I learned after I watched the movie that they shot the scenes in London but looking at them one might assume they're in Tunisia. There are even old men wearing ""Fes"" and smoking shisha. Safe to say I've never seen that many stereotypes crammed in one movie. Just so the rest of the world knows, being Turkish doesn't mean we look Arabic or oriental.

I didn't like Dylan O'Brien as Mitch. No depth and doesn't follow Flynn's character. Among other things, Rapp carries a Beretta 92F, not a H&K. He would not use an unsilenced weapon on an op, and biggest faux pas: Rapp is left handed, not right handed as the character in thus movie. And the story does not follow the boom at all. Poorly done, and highly disappointing for a huge Rapp fan who has been looking forward to seeing this rubbish. Vince Flynn is rolling in his grave.",American Assassin

As the stakes are raised a rogue operative is discovered to be building a nuclear bomb in a secret location and the elite CIA team become increasingly ineffectual. The only breaks in the case coming when Rapp disobeys orders. Something (luckily for them) he does continually. By the time the jarringly CGI-heavy finale comes, any semblance of reality has been lost, as has its sense of fun. Mitch Rapp just cannot catch a break, at the age of 14 he lost both parents in a car crash and then, seven years later, just moments after he proposes to her on an Ibiza beach, his fiancé is gunned down by Islamic terrorists.

The movie starts off promising with a very tense opening scene and what seemed to be an action packed smart movie turned out to be predictable And sometimes annoying.
There is no connection with the main character. Instead of feeling sorry for him and routing for him you tend to get annoyed with his lack of respect and defiance of direct orders. It's almost like the CIA doesn't know what to do, but he does, so he just acts independently Against directives. And they let him.
Michael Keaton is a great actor and he tries hard to salvage what turned out to be a mess of a movie but he can't do it alone. All the other characters are just blah.
There are some good action scenes but nothing we haven't seen before. Save your time and watch a Bourne movie again.",American Assassin

447,ernestpoirier,Bad Movie even if you didn't read the Novel,3,14 September 2017,"Let's start with those of us who are huge fans of Vince Flynn, and his numerous novels about Mitch Rapp. If you have read American Assassin, I highly warn you NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE, as it will be a complete disappointment. The only similarities are: The title, the characters, and the fact that Stan Hurley bites a guy's ear off. The other 92% of the movie is pure Hollywood b/s. The movie only needs to use the book as a guide, and take the story off the pages and onto the big screen, and it's a blockbuster, but no - they can't do that. They have to hack and mutilate a great story by Vince Flynn, and twist so many things that it makes you feel like walking out of the theatre.Now - let's say that you never read Vince Flynn's novel. I still would not recommend seeing this movie. The plot is sketchy at best. You have actors playing roles that they can't pull off (i.e. A french-man playing a Mossul agent). arggg. And then there is the second rate special effects / CGI. There is a particular scene near the end of a Navy Helicopter flying into the scene where Mitch Rapp has located the nuclear bomb (i.e. that's not part of the book either, and it's the premise for the movie)...but back to the chopper - it's obviously a special effect. Fast forward 10 minutes to the end, and the USS IKE (Aircraft Carrier) is in the ocean and there are waves crashing over it's deck.

448,reynoldsjohn-82126,Right Up There With John Wick 2 As Great Action Movies Of 2017!,10,14 September 2017,"I don't rarely rate movies on here, only when the movie has been exceptional or largely exceeded by expectations on what I thought I was going to watch. American Assassin is one of those movies. Going into the theater, I didn't expect much other than a decent action flick maybe something in the lines of Jason Bourne. What I got was a deeper, darker, and FAR more sinister action movie than Bourne ever got to. This is not a ""popcorn flick""(I always hated that term), something you just turn your brain off to see people get beat down. Although there is a lot of violence and beating down, this will actually stimulate your brain too. Which makes it far superior to generic Wal Mart Bin Beat Em ups in the 5 dollar cage. All 5 Bourne movies were PG13, a lot of people forget that. American Assassin is rated R and lets it be known. Rated R action movies are usually a lot more realistic. People die not get ""beaten up"", when someone is stabbed or shot their is blood, and the language used is more realistic, because yes people do curse in anger. It makes the movie far more realistic(as realistic as Hollywood action films can be anyways) and allows you to, at least some extent feel like YOU are part of the action. I will not spoil anything other than to say this is EASILY the best action movie of the year right next to John Wick 2. I have pretty high standards when it comes to action movies, I have been watching them all my life, and personally I felt American Assassin was a great movie.",American Assassin
449,mickanick-91719,Birth of an Assassin,8,15 September 2017,"A fun action movie with a top-notch turn by Dylan O'Brien as young Mitch Rapp. O'Brien's handling of the character's emotional arc supported the sometimes thin plot and occasional dialog clunkers. Michael Keaton was amazing in his first action film roll and was intense and believable as a former Navy S.E.A.L. and infamous Covert Ops team leader. Shiva Negar, who plays Rapp's counterpart, Annika, was the surprise of the film and came across as believable and amazingly competent at her job. Sanaa Lathan and Taylor Kitch also did a great job with with what they were given, but, unfortunately, they were saddled with the majority of the aforementioned clunkers.This movie would have gotten a 10-star rating from me if the pacing had been consistently tight all the way through and the dialog had been sharper. These are all highly intelligent, highly trained people whose words should be as quick and deadly as they are.The great cast and intense action sequences still made this a winner for me despite my quibbles, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. If you want an action film to squeeze in between Horror and Super Hero movies, American Assassin will fit the bill nicely.",American Assassin

Except for the key characters and a few scenes such as Hurley biting off someone's ear(but not the same character), the movie does not match the book at all including some key points about the Mitch Rapp character. I have to question whether the screenplay writers read the book or any of the books. It is a real shame because I have waited with great anticipation since the project was announced. I give a 3 instead of a 1 because my disappointment overrode my fair viewing of the movie.

I was excited to hear someone was going to make American Assassin. Typically, very few movies live up to their book counterparts, but many do a great job (Shawshank Redemption & Silence of the Lambs). This was not one of those. It was incredibly disappointing. Aside from Michael Keaton and his portrayal of Stan Hurley and Sanaa Lathan as Dr. Kennedy, the casting and character development was TERRIBLE. Dylan O'Brien, a pretty boy with a whiny- high voice and scrawny build, is not even close to what Mitch Rapp is and should be, a ruggedly handsome, athletic, self confident angel of death with a deep, gravelly voice. An actor like Jim Caviezel or Anson Mount would have been perfect. Making the casting worse, the character development and story line was just all over the place, and in the case of Rapp, was the complete opposite of how Mitch is described in the books. Also, the story didn't even follow any of the books' story lines.",American Assassin

463,rennytokic,Flawed action flick,1,1 March 2018,"Forget all those positive reviews for this movie, they are probably written by 14 year old kids who went to see the movie with a bunch of friends from school.
First of all let me clarify that I am a fan of Mitch Rapp books and that my review is not biased in any way. The movie is based upon a book by Vince Flynn with the same name. As per usual the movie industry doesn't follow the story of the book, they try to adapt the story so it can flow easier. In this particular case the story in movie is weapons grade atrocious. Why? Lets start off with the first scene in which Mr.Rapp proposes his girlfriend called Katrina Harper (Charlotte Vega), on a beach(in a swimsuit what shows off enough to make aforementioned 14 year olds happy). So he proposes and she says yes (nobody says no to rings), he goes to grab a drink for both of them. All of a sudden hell breaks loose with gunmen firing at everyone.This immediately put me of a great deal but i watched the whole movie anyway.
First of all there is no build up to the event of shooting and most of the shooters are as pale as mozzarella cheese. Only one of the shooters looked like he was from middle east. So why is that important? Whole Mitch Rapp universe is about hunting terrorists and most of them are not white guys that look they came from a beach party in Ibiza. Also in this scene you can tell the movie was low budget because the gun shooting felt so wrong and ""digital"". While on the subject of shooting, in this scene Mitch was shot 2 times. First shot was a graze on the thigh and second must have shattered his collarbone or done massive damage(terrorists used AK's and those things don't inflict the same damage as your M16 would). What does Mitch do? He keeps on going to get to his fiancee and when he gets there the terrorist shoots off two more bullets into her even when she was already pretty much dead from the shot trough the heart. So ignoring the fact that the movie is ignoring the story from the book and ignoring some common sense what else is there to the movie? Well the whole story in the movie is all over the place. First they need to kill a turkish benker/weapon dealer (this is actually the only thing that is following the book correctly) but that goes to shit quickly (because why would it?) when a guy called ""Ghost"" (Taylor Kitsch) disrupts it all. From there story goes everywhere and nowhere. What else? Oh yes I forgot to mention the cast. Mitch Rapp is played by Dylan O'Brien which is the worst possible choice, in his place I would have loved to see Gerard Butler or Scott Adkins(who sadly played minor role in this movie). One of Rapp traits in book is his ability to blend almost anywhere. I can't see O'Brien blending anywere besides London and LA. Hurley (Michael Keaton) feels okay but needs a bit more age added to him. Director Stansfield and Kennedy characters are okay for the most part but still there are better choices.
In short, don't watch the movie, get the book instead.",American Assassin

I do wish they would had offered some more time in the movie to build the story and develope the characters, but if they make it a franchise there is still time to do that in future chapters. I also wish they would have casted Donald Sutherland as Thomas Stansfield, as he feels more right for the role when you compare with the book, but he didn't have much screen time here anyway, so no biggie.I see there are quite a few 1 star reviews of the movie, so much so that they seem like an organized protest campaign against the movie. I would recommend you disregard those reviews and see the trailer instead. The trailer gives a good indication of what to expect from the movie. Would be fun to know what the average rating for this movie was if you removed all the 1 star and 10 star reviews from the calculation.Overall a really enjoyable and fast paced action flick.",American Assassin

Dr Irene Kennedy is so far off key from the books character that it's impossible to relate the two. Michael Keaton as the irascible Stan Hurley was OK but that's just it, OK. 
When you have a great storyline already written and the principal characters perfectly drawn, surely it is not such a stretch to translate to film? These days of political correctness have gone mad and ruined the chance for a Mitch Rapp franchise as far as I am concerned.
