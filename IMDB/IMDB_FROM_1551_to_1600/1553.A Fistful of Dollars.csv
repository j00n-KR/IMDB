0,MartinHafer,"Nearly as excellent as the followup film, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE",8,19 July 2006,"I've read in many places that this is the prequel to FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, and while I could understand people thinking this, this really isn't the case. It's more a film ""inspired"" by FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, as the same chief bad guy (Gian Maria Volontè) is killed in both films and Clint Eastwood is not the same amoral bounty hunter he is in the sequel. However, he looks the same and acts almost the same, so why be picky? Especially since if you like one of these movies, it's certain you will like both,...though I think overall FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is a slightly better film--mostly due to the appearance of Lee Van Cleef.FISTFUL OF DOLLARS is a reworking of the Kurosawa masterpiece YOJIMBO. And, while it's not quite as perfect as the original Japanese film (this would practically be impossible to achieve), it's a wonderful reworking of the plot by putting it in the old West. Plus, it does have an edge over the original when it comes to the always strange but always cool music from Ennio Morricone. Both Toshiro Mifune and Clint Eastwood play odd characters who the audience know very little about who wander into a town torn by a war between two rival gangs. And, in both, our heroes use their brains and fantastic fighting skills to wipe out both gangs for the good of the people.The movie begins with Eastwood coming to an unfriendly Mexican town and seeing a little boy trying to sneak in to see his mother who was kidnapped by the town's #1 bully. Although Clint (nicknamed ""the Man with no Name"" by fans) isn't visibly shaken when the kid is soon discovered and thrown out, he spends much of the movie trying to figure out why the baddies are holding her as well as how to get her safely back to her family. About the only real negative I saw in the film was some of the dubbing--in particular, the kid. He was SO whiny and shrill that I wondered why the bad guys didn't just kill the kid to shut him up once and for all! However, being a smart good guy (and yes, he is more of a good guy in this film than in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE), he doesn't immediately act but uses his brain to get the two rival gangs in town to wipe each other out instead of relying on his lightning fast shooting to kill everyone (something even this character probably couldn't do). To do this, he pretends to help both gangs by selling them information and playing tricks on them. At first, his two new friends in town can't understand several things he does--but Clint has a master plan.Like every early Eastwood Western I can think of, at some point Clint is captured and has the crap knocked out of him (it also happened in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY as well as in HANG EM HIGH). But, this is only just before Clint strikes back and finishes the job. In this case, with the aid of home made plate mail, he is able to beat Gian Maria Volontè and what's left of his gang in a dandy showdown.The movie has so many excellent touches that it's hard to figure out the negatives in the film--other than a few of the dubbed voices. In fact, this is the only problem. The music, direction, acting and script are all top-notch. A wonderful but violent early ""Spaghetti Western"".",A Fistful of Dollars
1,TheLittleSongbird,A great film from Sergio Leone,9,25 July 2012,"A Fistful of Dollars is not quite as good as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly from the Three Dollars trilogy(or Once Upon a Time in America and Once Upon a Time in the West), and I also think the film that inspired it Kurosawa's Yojimbo is the superior film. That said, that is not down-grading A Fistful of Dollars in any way, it is still a truly great film. As with all Leone's it is incredibly well made, the scenery is epic and looks gorgeous and the extreme close ups really helps to enhance the unrelenting violence. Ennio Morricone's score is wonderful with its minimalist style really fitting with the movie. The story is both elegiac which helps to give that feel of mystery to the Man with No Name's character and thrilling with the violence and the camera work. Leone's direction is as ever superb, as is the acting. Clint Eastwood became an international superstar and you can see why, he oozes charisma and his idea to make The Man with No Name mysterious with minimal dialogue proved to be a great one. Of the supporting cast, Gian Maria Volonte is especially impressive, as Ramon he snarls very convincingly. All in all, a great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",A Fistful of Dollars
2,bkoganbing,The sleepy town of San Miguel,6,4 January 2018,"A Fistful Of Dollars is the film that turned a television star who was wondering 
where his next bit of work would be coming from after his TV series Rawhide would end into an international film icon. Clint Eastwood gets the break of his
life in starring in this European western produced and directed by Italians and
shot in Spain.Clint's character is superficially like Shane, the gallant loner who rides into the
area, settles all the troubles and rides into the sunset. But that's most superficially because there's light years between quiet soft spoken Alan Ladd
and the bloody and explosive Mr. Eastwood who always lets his gun do his
talking. There's more fatalities in the first 10 minutes of A Fistful Of Dollars
than there are in all of Shane and any number of John Wayne westerns.In this story Clint rides into the border town of San Miguel where two factions
of outlaws have just made the place there headquarters. When they're not killing each other they're terrorizing the citizens. To be sure Clint isn't responsible for all the deaths in the film, the bad guys do quite a bit to each other.I've never been a fan of anything other than American made westerns and think that all of Clint's westerns made this side of the pond are superior to his
three with Sergio Leone. But I sure can't deny the lasting impact these films
had on the culture and on Eastwood's career.And the career of composer Errico Morricone was certainly made with this
film.Come see an icon and watch from whence he came.",A Fistful of Dollars
3,Leofwine_draca,Iconic spaghetti western,8,16 July 2016,"The film that served as Sergio Leone's big break was also the film that kick-started the entire ""spaghetti western"" genre which would churn out hundreds of films in the five years that followed. It's not really surprising, as there's something very enticing and watchable about this movie; it's a very stylish and likeable movie which, as well as making Leone an Italian force to be reckoned with, also dragged Eastwood's career out of the television doldrums and turned him, overnight, into an international movie star.What I loved most about this movie was, strangely, the music, created by old hand Ennio Morricone. The main theme, a lyrical whistle, is addictive and very evocative of the period; the western and this kind of music go hand in hand, so when you think of one you automatically think of the other. While the music adds to the feel of the film, the authentic location shooting of desolate mountains also creates a barren, sun-parched atmosphere, so evocative that you can almost feel yourself in the story, with the heat pounding down on you.Eastwood is strong in this film, creating a mysterious and charismatic hero with no name who would return in two sequels; his character is now the stuff of movie legend. The supporting cast are also excellent, with the swarthy villains menacing, the women alluring and the good guys likeable and amusing. Likewise, the film's low budget works wonders, with a definitive cool costume for Eastwood and plenty of explosions and gun play.What I particularly liked about this film was the death imagery (something that would be more fully explored in later westerns like DJANGO); an undertaker and his coffins play a major role in the film, with an injured Eastwood even hiding out in a coffin at one point. Corpses are used to provoke battles and shoot-outs in the streets leave bodies piled everywhere. These classic shoot-outs are brilliantly shot; they may seem clichéd today due to what's come after them, but all the camera angles and pauses are just right. A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS is one of those rare films that has a ""magic"" feel about it and the complex plot should keep most viewers engaged, as well as action fans.",A Fistful of Dollars
4,SnoopyStyle,Spaghetti Western Classic,8,21 September 2013,"Joe (Clint Eastwood) is a drifter with quick hands. When he arrives into town, he kills four men who harassed him. He finds there are two gangs led by John Baxter and Ramón Rojo. He finds the four men he killed were with Baxter. Instead of siding with one side, he decides to play both sides off each other.This is the first spaghetti western to get major international success. Director Sergio Leone has created a classic and Clint Eastwood into a major star. There is a little bit complicated with a story of back and forth double crossing. There are some great iconic scenes. The music has gone down in history as spaghetti western classic. Even the dubbed voices add to the feel of the movie. This is movie history.",A Fistful of Dollars
5,claudio_carvalho,"""Yojimbo"" Revisited - The Beginning of the Spaghetti Westerns",8,15 August 2008,"A drifter gunman (Clint Eastwood) arrives in the Mexican village of San Miguel in the border of United States of America, and befriends the owner of the local bar Silvanito (Jose Calvo). The stranger discovers that the town is dominated by two gangster lords: John Baxter (W. Lukschy) and the cruel Ramón Rojo (Gian Maria Volontè  a.k.a. John Wells). When the stranger kills four men of the Baxter's gang, he is hired by Ramón's brother Esteban Rojo (S. Rupp) to join their gang. However, the stranger plots a scheme working for both sides and playing one side against the other.""Per un Pugno di Dollari"" is a milestone in the history of the cinema, since the genre of ""Spaghetti Westerns"" didn't really exist previous to this movie. Sergio Leone used the storyline of Akira Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"", replacing the samurai without a master (""ronin"") Sanjuro Kuwabatake performed by Toshirô Mifune and the scenario of the rural Japanese town in Nineteenth Century by the stranger without a name (Clint Eastwood) and a small Mexican town in the border of the Wild and Far West. The result is a magnificent and remarkable movie, and beginning of the trilogy of Clint Eastwood's character Joe, who proves that ""a man with a rifle beats a man with .45"", completed by ""Per Qualche Dollaro in Più"" and ""Il Buono, il Brutto, il Cattivo"", . My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Por um Punhado de Dólares"" (""For a Fistful of Dollars"")",A Fistful of Dollars
6,classicsoncall,"""Death can be very useful sometimes.""",8,18 August 2007,"At some point, I'll have to research the mystery behind the concept of 'The Man With No Name', because in this, the genre creating Western establishing Clint Eastwood as an international star, his name was Joe, and it was clearly stated more than once. Yet here was something different, a mono-syllabic, no nonsense anti-hero who spoke with his guns and his fists, and sometimes it was a toss up as to which was louder. The intrigue and novelty of his character is established early - ""My mistake... four coffins"". From there, the body count takes on a life (death?) of it's own, played out as a gang war between the Rojo's and the Baxter's, with No Name Joe the fuse, often as short as the cheroot dangling from his lips.Amid the blood and bullets, I guess the reason for the popularity of Eastwood's persona is that at his core, he's a loyal and honorable character. He rescues his benefactor Silvanito (Jose Calvo) from torture, and comes to the aid of Ramon's unwilling mistress Marisol (Marianne Koch). Here's a guy you can beat to a bloody pulp and he keeps on ticking, but it's the ticking of a time bomb about to explode. I particularly enjoyed the clever way he took out the rotund Chico (Mario Brega) by shooting out the door posts, that had to be quite the headache.With my most recent viewing, I was particularly impressed with the Ennio Morricone score, perhaps not the best he would ever come up with, but new and different enough for the era to mark his arrival on the scene. Not only was the spaghetti Western something new, but so was it's hallmark music.The movie's most quoted lines have to do with the four coffins and the 'aim for the heart' business, but midway through, Silvanito got a response out of me at the Rio Bravo massacre with ""It's like playing cowboys and Indians"". Eastwood also sums things up nicely following the final confrontation between the Rojo's and Baxter's - ""Let's go, the show's over anyway"".",A Fistful of Dollars
7,gavin6942,"Good, But Not Leone's Best",6,22 April 2011,"A wandering gunfighter plays two rival families against each other in a town torn apart by greed, pride, and revenge.Sergio Leone kicks off his spaghetti western trilogy with Clint Eastwood as the man with no name (and quickly followed this with ""For a Few Dollars More""). While it is not the best of the series, it still ranks above your average western, and Clint Eastwood always delivers.You can see Eastwood knock a woman out, you can catch the exploding barrel. Gun enthusiasts might enjoy the discussion of a .45 versus a Winchester rifle. The winner of this debate lives, the loser dies. Sort of ads some weight to the topic.This was the first time that Sergio Leone and composer Ennio Morricone worked together. Initially Leone was not keen on using Morricone for this film. Lacerenza's initial trumpet performance of the score made Leone quickly set aside any reservations. Leone and Morricone, who had known each other since 3rd grade, would develop a close working relationship that would last through all of Leone's future films.",A Fistful of Dollars
8,lee_eisenberg,My parents drove through the town in Spain where this was filmed.,7,6 January 2006,"What made the spaghetti westerns different from John Wayne movies and such was that they showed the Old West as violent and gritty, and the people as dirty (the John Wayne movies portrayed the Old West as fancy and the people as good, clean Christians). ""Per un pugno di dollari"" (called ""A Fistful of Dollars"" in English) definitely showed the dismal side. The plot of course has The Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) arriving in a small town and playing two groups off against each other.Obviously, Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns are the ones against which all others should be judged. This one not only had two sequels, but also paved the way for Leone directing ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America"". It's not exactly a great movie, but definitely a groundbreaking one. As it was, 1964 saw a number of groundbreaking things: the Beatles coming to America, ""Dr. Strangelove"", and the Civil Rights Act.And yes, when my parents were in Spain in 1992, they drove through the town where this was filmed. They could clearly see that it looked like the town in the movies.",A Fistful of Dollars
9,jboothmillard,A Fistful of Dollars,10,29 June 2005,"I had not seen the ""Spaghetti"" Western Trilogy, directed by Sergio Leone (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West, Once Upon a Time in America), for many years, and it made perfect sense to watch them again during the 90th birthday of the leading star. Basically, a ""Man with No Name"" (Clint Eastwood) arrives at the small of San Miguel, on the Mexico-United States border. Silvanito (José Calvo), the town's innkeeper, tells the Stranger (known in the cast as ""Joe"") about a feud between two families vying for control of the town: the Rojo brothers, Don Miguel (Antonio Prieto), Esteban (Sieghardt Rupp) and Ramón (Gian Maria Volontè), and the family of Sheriff John Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy). The Stranger proves his speed and accuracy with his gun, confronting, shooting, and killing four men who insulted him as he entered town, and he earns a reward. The Stranger seizes an opportunity to search for gold, making the Rojos and the Baxters fight each other, during which Antonio (Bruno Carotenuto) is captured. While searching for the gold, the Stranger accidentally knocks out Ramón's beautiful prisoner and unwilling mistress, Marisol (Marianne Koch). He takes her to the Rojos in exchange for Antonio. After protecting her and her family from harm, the Stranger is told out the history of trouble the family have had, in the name of Ramon, she is essentially his hostage. That night, while the Rojos are celebrating, the Stranger rides out and frees Marisol, shooting the guards and wrecking the house. He gives Marisol some money and tells her family to leave the town. When the Rojos discover that the Stranger freed Marisol, they capture and torture him, until he manages to escape. Believing him to be protected by the Baxters, the Rojos set fire to the Baxter home and massacre the entire family as they run out of the burning building. Ramón kills John Baxter and his son Antonio after pretending to spare them. Baxter's wife, Consuelo (Margarita Lozano) appears and curses the Rojos for killing her unarmed husband and son. She is then shot and killed by Esteban. With help from Piripero (Joe Egger), the local coffin-maker, the Stranger escapes town by hiding in a coffin. He hides and recovers in a nearby mine, and eventually returns to town to face the Rojos. Hidden beneath the Stranger's poncho is a steel chest-plate, he taunts Ramón to ""aim for the heart"". Ramón panics and uses all the bullets in his Winchester, until the Stranger reveals his protection. The Stranger shoots the rifle from Ramón's hand and kills the other Rojos, including Don Miguel and Rubio (Benny Reeves) standing nearby. He then uses the last bullet in his gun to free Silvanito, tied hanging from a post. After challenging Ramón to reload his rifle faster than he can reload his own revolver, the Stranger shoots and kills Ramón. Esteban Rojo aims for the Stranger's back from a nearby building but is shot dead by Silvanito. It ends when the Stranger bids farewell and rides away from the town. Also starring Daniel Martín as Julián, and Mario Brega as Chico. Eastwood as the iconic ""Man with No Name"" looks really cool, looking steely eyed in his poncho, smoking cigars, it is said most of his dialogue was cut to make him more mysterious, it is no surprise that he became an international superstar. The film does have lip-sync and dubbing issues, and the story is a little up-and-down and slow at times, but for Eastwood, brilliant use of extreme close-ups, the tense showdown sequences, the violence, and the memorable score by Ennio Morricone, this is a great classic western. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Outstanding!",A Fistful of Dollars
10,rmax304823,My Gun Is Quick.,4,6 January 2013,"Some people whose opinions I respect admire this movie but, to tell the truth, I could hardly get through it. I can't fathom its appeal. After the first scenes, involving Eastwood protecting his mule's pride, I expected it to be a continuing joke. It was kind of witty. ""My mule don't like you laughin' at him."" Ennio Morricone's music helped establish it as some kind of comedy, with that whistling flute and the dirge-like underscoring of the dramatic scenes. I didn't think the composer could take it seriously, and I still don't. But I've come to believe that Sergio Leone thought he was making a good, tense, Western.In my view, he was wrong. It's more of a caricature. It's based on Akira Kurosawa's samurai movie, ""Yojimbo,"" which was modeled after John Ford's work, so ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is an Italian imitation of a Japanese imitation of an American Western.If Grandma Moses had been a director she might have come up with something like this. When Leone wants us to see someone's face, we see someone's FACE. Right up close. So close you can smell the garlic, see the glistening teeth. And when he REALLY wants us to see the face, as during moments of extreme stress, we see the face only from brow to philtrum. At this distance we see every bead of sweat, every pore sprouting a bit of whisker. We are on a first-name basis with the nasolingual fold and you can see the Darwinian points quiver. Sometimes, when Leone wants to indicate that a person is walking down the dusty street, we see nothing but his boots and brutal spurs. When he stops walking, the camera lingers on those items -- as if there were three things of value in this world: truth, beauty, and those boots.The acting is as overdone as the makeup, except for Clint Eastwood, who is made up impressively but doesn't act. Gian Maria Volonté is the chief heavy. Near the opening we watch him shoot down dozens of Mexican troops with a machine gun the likes of which the earth has never known. It's water cooled and yet it's not. It has multiple muzzles like a Gatling gun yet nothing revolves. It appears to have the breach of a Browning but has two handles. We see the barrel firing from behind. We see Volonté's maniacally grinning face as it shoots. Yet we never see the machine gun itself in action. That's because it's probably made of cardboard.Now, I'm not a gun freak and I don't care whether the gun is real or not. What I'm pointing to is not the stupid fake gun but the general air of sloppiness that prevails throughout the movie.Eastwood didn't speak Italian and Leone didn't speak English. Not that it matters. Eastwood, fresh from a long television Western series where every facial twitch registers like an earthquake, was made for a directorial style like Leone's. As Leone was to say later, ""Michelangelo claimed that he could look at a block of marble and see the man inside; I looked at a man and saw the block of marble inside."" Eastwood never did become much of an actor. He's not the type to emote, and it limited his range. We remember him for one or two of his lines -- ""Go ahead, make my day."" Yet, in later years, he's turned out some exceptionally good work as a director. ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is a Western. But so is ""Unforgiven."" Compare the two.",A Fistful of Dollars
11,Tweekums,Still fresh after nearly fifty years,10,17 July 2012,"This film signals that it is going to be different from American westerns made before in its opening scene; we are introduced to the protagonist as he rides into a Mexican town and drinks from the well; he sees a small child screaming for his mother and a couple of men come out of the house and chase the boy off, shooting as they do so. Any traditional western hero would have shot the men, or at least tried to intervene; but not here; he just watches then rides into town. After a confrontation with a group of men he goes to the bar and learns that they work for the Baxters, one of two rival gangs, the others are the Rojos. Observing that a man could get rich in a town like this he heads back to see the men then shoots them all. With four dead Baxters he goes to the Rojos and seeks employment. Things are quiet for a while; then the Mexican Army bring a shipment of gold to town; it is meant to buy guns off the US Army but the exchange on the border turns into a bloodbath when men in US uniforms open fire; they are with Ramón Rojo; the head of the family.This action provides the stranger with an opportunity; he moves two of the bodies and props them up in the graveyard. He then tells both the Baxters and the Rojos that there are two survivors who witnessed the crime and while they fight it out he looks for the stolen gold and takes Ramón's woman to the Baxters. He continues playing each side against the other until one day he decides to help the woman be reunited with her child; this gets him caught and almost killed; it also leads to a massacre and ultimately a showdown between the stranger and Ramón Rojo.Having enjoyed quite a few more traditional westerns recently I was surprised just how different this was, despite having seen it several times over the years. Clint Eastwood's portrayal of 'The Man with No Name' has become iconic; he is there to make money and starts a war between the two families to get it; he also has a sense of humour; it is almost impossible not to laugh as he asks four gunslingers to apologise to his mule! It is harder to judge the performances of the other actors as they have been dubbed into English. Another cliché avoided was the fact that Clint didn't 'get the girl' at the end; in fact there was no love interest for him at all... unless you count his love of money! There is plenty of action which all leads to a great finale. Director Sergio Leone did a masterful job; especially with his famous use of close-ups where a characters face would fill the screen to the extent that all you could see were is eyes and nose; this meant we see every nervous twitch and drop of sweat as they prepare to shoot. The music, provided by Ennio Morricone is one of the great movie scores serving to create just the right atmosphere. All fans of westerns should check this out; it is a classic!",A Fistful of Dollars
12,ma-cortes,The first and original installment of the ¨Dollars trilogy¨ with Clint Eastwood as ¨Man with no name¨.,8,14 July 2009,"The epitome of the S.W. is violent , beautifully crafted and exaggerated . This was the first S.W. to receive a major international release . It is a remake of Yojimbo (1961), which itself was based on 1929 novel ""Red Harvest"" by Dashiell Hammett . It pits ¨Man with no name¨ against two families that are feuding over business : the Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy , Margarita Lozano) and the Rojo (Gian Maria Volonte , Antonio Pietro , Sieghardt Rupp) . Meanwhile , Eastwood saves a damsel in distress (Marianne Koch) , her husband (Daniel Martin) and son . ¨Man with no name¨ is helped by Silvanito (José Calvo) and an old gravedigger , Piripero (Joseph Egger).This classic Western contains slow and deliberating filming , elaborate shoot-outs , and portentous close-ups of grime-encrustred faces with bloodbaths included . A remake to Yojimbo by Akira Kurosawa , in fact he sued the filmmakers for breach of copyright . The impact of this Spaghetti opened the gate for the huge numbers of Italian-Spanish Western which made fortune for their producers and directors in the sixties and early seventies . This has been described as the first ""spaghetti western"", but when this film was made , there had already been about 25 such westerns produced in Italy . This one made Eastwood an international star and previously better-known for his running character in TV series ¨Rawhide¨. Leone did revive his career almost instantly on the strength of this film , though the role was formerly offered to Charles Bronson , Frank Wolff , Rory Calhoun , Steve Reeves and Richard Harrison . In fact , Richard Harrison was the one who suggested Clint Eastwood to Sergio Leone when the famed director was looking for the main actor , as Harrison said : Maybe my greatest contribution to cinema was not doing Fistful of Dollars , and recommending Clint for the part . Leone came to the set of ¨Rawhide¨ intending to recruit Eric Fleming for the lead in the upcoming ""A Fistful of Dollars"" , due to Fleming's off putting personality, Leone looked elsewhere , director Charles Marquis Warren suggested Eastwood as an alternative . As all of Eastwood's later Western and his ¨Dirty Harry¨ movies owe a considerable debt to Leone . Furthermore , here appears Leone's habitual secondaries , acting as ominous hoodlums , such as : Mario Brega , Aldo Sambrell , Antonio Molino Rojo , Lorenzo Robledo , Jose Canalejas , Frank Braña , among them.It's a slick remake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo , the plot is mainly ripped off from classic Japanese , as Kurosawa wrote to Leone reclaiming the copyright . Ultimatelly , the Toho (Yojimbo's producer) obtained the rights of exhibition and received 15% of the film's worldwide gross and exclusive distribution rights for Asian countries . ¨Fistful of dollars¨ was filmed in low-budget during seven weeks on location in Golden City (Sierra of Madrid) , and Almeria : Albaricoques and Tabernas ; besides , interiors located on Roman Cinecitta studios . In the premiere the main cast and technicians were replaced by American names as John Welles (Gian Maria Volonte) , master of arms Benny Reeves (Benito Stefanelli), Dan Savio (Ennio Morricone who composed a groundbreaking and streaking soundtrack) , designer production by Charles Simons (Carlo Simi) and even Bob Robertson (Sergio Leone) ; nowadays , justly stay the true names . For Leone enthusiastic with his usual trademarks , it's full of which made his films so memorable, others might find it a bit long but no one can deny its sense of style what achieved a great burst of world-wide popularity .",A Fistful of Dollars
13,BA_Harrison,"Classic Clint, all stubble and squint.",8,17 April 2015,"A Fistful Of Dollars, the first in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy (the others being For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), is the film that seriously kick-started the Spaghetti Western craze, introducing audiences the world over to a far grittier Wild West than they had ever seen in a John Wayne movie. It's also the film that made a star out of Clint Eastwood, who, as The Man With No Name, established himself as the go-to guy for a badass anti-hero with a big gun.Clint, all stubble and squint, rides into the town of San Miguel on his mule, and begins to play the two gangs that run the place against each other, making himself a 'fistful of dollars' in the process. At the same time, he helps local beauty Marisol (Marianne Koch) escape her torment as bandit Ramón Rojo's plaything. Introducing the style that has since become synonymous with director Leone—gritty violence, extreme close-ups of twitchy faces juxtaposed with lengthy long shots, much inspired by Japanese film-makers—the film is a visually impressive and utterly engrossing piece of cinema from its iconic opening credits sequence (accompanied by a classic Morricone score) to its corpse strewn finale.",A Fistful of Dollars
14,Quinoa1984,Exciting Western remake that doesn't lose it's energy after forty years,10,30 December 2003,"Though Fistful of Dollars could, perhaps, be counted by most Leone and Eastwood fans as being the least of the three films in the Dollars trilogy, this film does prove one thing that hasn't changed since its release- a remake can give an equally powerful punch in its execution as long as it's faithful to its source story and can make it on its own terms. Yojimbo was one of Akira Kurosawa's finest samurai works, but Leone must've sensed a desire to bring the Japanese master's influence from Westerns back into that terrain, and though the story for Fistful is practically un-altered from its influence, it delivers the goods as both a gun-flinging outlaw western and as a subtle tale of morals in evil times. Eastwood's archetypal ""The Man with No Name"" is named Joe here (technically this comes after The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly in chronological order), and he enters a town with two rival gangs, the Baxters and the Rojos. Gian Maria Volonte plays the most vicious of the Rojos, Ramon, who is the only major obstacle for Joe in this town, as he figures out a way to play both gangs to get extra earnings. Along the way, the slightest sense of morality creeps into his mind-set, as the killings unfold. With many classic scenes (the climax is one of Clint's more infamous cinematic scenes, serving as an inspiration for the Back to the Future parts 2 & 3), Ennio Morricone's first great musical pairing with Leone, and moments that bring intensity and coolness in repeat viewings, Fistful of Dollars is one of those Westerns that's a lot of fun, and can be taken seriously too by film connoisseurs.",A Fistful of Dollars
15,edwagreen,Fistful is Empty **,4,21 November 2012,"Clint Eastwood came off absolutely dull here. It appears to me that as the years passed, his acting got a lot better.In this 1964 film, he is a drifter who wanders into a town filled with corruption shared equally by two rival families. What better way to get the better of them by the divide and conquer scheme. He will literally have each other and one another's throats. There is enough shooting here to last a life-time. No one is immune from the latter; even the wife of one rival family gets a belly full as she screams that her husband wasn't even armed.Eastwood's monotonous tone despite good looks and the wearing of a poncho doesn't do him justice in this Sergio Leone's movie.",A Fistful of Dollars
16,wes-connors,Sergio Leone puts Clint Eastwood on the Map,7,14 April 2010,"On leave from his ""Rawhide"" TV series, rough 'n' rowdy Clint Eastwood (as Joe, ""The Man with No Name"") orchestrates a colossal shoot 'em up in the Mexican border town of San Miguel, by playing one side against the other. Along the way, he rescues a pretty woman, Marianne Koch (as Marisol), who reminds him of someone he couldn't help, some time ago. Mr. Eastwood even gets a Samurai-style sword. Beaten to within an inch of his life, Eastwood cleans up to show he can take a licking and keep on ticking.By now, western plots were recycled frequently, but this one was immediately recognizable as too close a swipe of Akira Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"" (1961), which director Sergio Leone had obviously seen more than once. At least, Mr. Leone showed he had good taste, and made his own contribution with the material. The soundtrack music, by Ennio Morricone, is perfectly in tune with the film's vision. Eastwood and Gian Maria Volonté (as Ramon Rojo) have a classic confrontation. And, Eastwood's character isn't bad... just mysterious.******* Per un pugno di dollari (9/12/64) Sergio Leone ~ Clint Eastwood, Gian Maria Volonte, Marianne Koch, Wolfgang Lukschy",A Fistful of Dollars
17,sunwarrior13,A Wonderful Cinematic Experience,10,20 October 2012,"A Fistful of Dollars is a western film directed by Sergio Leone that features Clint Eastwood, alongside Gian Maria Volonté, Marianne Koch, Wolfgang Lukschy, Sieghardt Rupp, José Calvo, Antonio Prieto, and Joseph Egger. Based on Akira Kurosawa's samurai picture Yojimbo, it scored a resounding success as did its sequels, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Leone approached the genre with great love and humor. Although the plot was admittedly borrowed from Kurosawa's,he managed to create a work of his own that would serve as a model for many films to come. A mysterious gunman has just arrived in San Miguel, a grim, dusty border town where two rival bands of smugglers are terrorizing the impoverished citizens. A master of the ""quick-draw"",the stranger soon receives offers of employment from each gang. But his loyalty cannot be bought; he accepts both jobs and sets in motion a plan to destroy both groups of criminals, pitting one against the other in a series of brilliantly orchestrated setups, showdowns and deadly confrontations.Once in a great while a western comes along that breaks new ground and becomes a classic of the genre.It's Leone's shortest and simplest film, but all of his hallmarks such as masterly use of space within the widescreen frame, Ennio Morricone's unusual soundtrack music, plenty of silence are already in place.Added to that,this film helped define a new era for the Western and usher in its most iconic star, Clint Eastwood.A wonderful cinematic experience indeed.",A Fistful of Dollars

19,Hey_Sweden,"""Well, that's all very cozy, but I don't find you men that appealing.""",9,16 May 2021,"In the first of his legendary collaborations with filmmaker Sergio Leone, Clint Eastwood plays a lone gunslinger who ambles into the small town of San Miguel. Soon, he learns that the two warring crime families in town, the Rojos and the Baxters, each have their own specialty. With the Rojos, it's liquor. With the Baxters, it's guns. Since they have plenty of money between the two of them, ""Joe"" figures that he can best profit from playing them against each other.This is a film of major importance as any film buff can tell you: it made Clint an international superstar, and brought both Leone and composer Ennio Morricone (whose score is truly wonderful) to real prominence. Its incredible success opened the floodgates for the entire ""Spaghetti Western"" genre, and it's easy to see why. It's a stylish, atmospheric, intelligent film. A number of talents had a hand in the story and screenplay, an effective Western variation on the story of ""Yojimbo"".""Joe"" is a very cool customer with laconic dialogue to spare. He faces all opponents with confidence. He's a protagonist with a difference; although not totally unfeeling, it's telling that he chooses to look the other way near the beginning when a drunken lout is taking shots at a distraught child. And yet, he still has a human quality about him, as he takes pity on Marisol (Marianne Koch) and helps her because she reminds him of somebody he once knew.It's true that many of the supporting characters aren't as interesting as ""Joe"", but that doesn't mean that the actors are bad. Not at all. Gian Maria Volonte does a very capable job as one of the main antagonists, the swaggering Ramon Rojo. Jose Calvo is quite amiable as the helpful bartender Silvanito, as is Joseph Egger as Piripero, the towns' coffin maker who's at least one guy other than the baddies who can earn a decent living. (Owing to the fact that so many residents end up dead.)Leone takes full advantage of the 2.35:1 Techniscope aspect ratio, the way that he arranges so much of the cast in the frame. People really owe it to themselves to see films like this the way that they were meant to be seen.The other films in the ""Dollars"" trilogy may have somewhat eclipsed this one over the years, but there's no denying its potency, or entertainment value. It deals out an impressive amount of death & destruction, with an especially grandiose climax.Nine out of 10.",A Fistful of Dollars
20,Doylenf,Clint makes his mark in Sergio Leone's spaghetti western...,7,27 August 2006,"When the man with no name rides into a sun-baked western town wearing a poncho, a fixed expressionless squint, guns loaded, and you hear Ennio Morricone's staccato music blaring in the background, you know you're in for a real slambang, dirty western like A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS.And when CLINT EASTWOOD looks over the town, decides to play two feuding gang families against each other and tells someone, ""There's a lot of money to be made in this town,"" you're reminded that the producers of this film had the same idea when they fashioned the script out of a Japanese story and decided to make a lot of money out of it.It all clicks--the no name anti-hero who cleans up a town so thoroughly within the first hour that you wonder how there are any inhabitants left. He's certainly doing the coffin-maker a favor. And when he shoots it out with the bad guys, you know he's got nothing to worry about. You can almost predict he'll walk off into the sunset for the finale.Eastwood makes being an outlaw look like a hell of a lot of fun. Hat pulled down over his eyes, he looks as though no target is impossible for him to miss. He's clearly looking out for himself, plain and simple, without a care as to how many men he sends to the undertaker.Ennio Morricone's score is the added treat, giving even more punch to the film than any of the performances, although they're all pretty convincing.Naturally, the film made a lot of money for Eastwood and the producers and had movie audiences begging for more.",A Fistful of Dollars
21,lastliberal,My mistake. Four coffins...,8,1 May 2007,"It is interesting to go back and see how things began. Sergio Leone's remake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo(1961) into a western still has all the Samurai flavor. The idea of a nameless man traveling from town to town righting wrongs was alien to those brought up on Randolph Scott and John Wayne.Leone's use of bright light was also something that I thoroughly enjoyed in this film. Why not have all the grittiness on display for all to see? I get tired of low light flicks.It may not be the best of the Leone/Eastwood features, but it was the one that started it all and transformed Rowdy Yates into a star.I would be remiss not to mention the brilliant score of Ennio Morricone. Magnificent!",A Fistful of Dollars
22,zardoz-13,When A Man with a .45 Meets A Man With a Rifle . . .,9,16 November 2008,"Sergio Leone's ""Per un pugno di dollari"" ranks not only as a landmark horse opera in the history of the western but also in evolution of the spaghetti western. Hollywood had been churning out westerns since ""The Great Train Robbery"" in 1903, and the Italians had been cloning those westerns, for example ""Gunfight at Red Sands, before Leone revolutionized them with this Clint Eastwood epic. Indeed, mainly on the plains of Spain, Leone would reinvent the western and make it more violent than it had been before and until Sam Peckinpah would step from the background into the foreground with his 1969 western ""The Wild Bunch."" ""Per un pugno di dollari"" altered everything and forged a new hero who was for all practical purposes an anti-hero. Joe (Clint Eastwood) shot first in a duel, wore stubble on his jaws, and was motivated largely by money. Leone had to pare this sagebrusher down to its quintessential components because of a shoestring budget. Nevertheless, despite its financial shortcomings, this Italian/German/Spanish co-production looks fantastic in its 2.35.1 letterbox format and the Spanish and Roman locale double more or less invisibly to the simple but exciting plot. Most die-hand ""Dollar"" fans know that Leone and producers Arrigo Colombo and Giorgio Papi had to settle a copyright infringement suit with Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"" before they could release the film outside of Italy. Leone maintained that eighteenth Venetian playwright Carlo Goldoni's play ""A Servant with Two Masters"" inspired ""Per un pugno di dollari,"" but the courts ruled in Kurosawa's favor. The action unfolds as our anti-heroic protagonist rides up to a well located near two white-washed, single-storied dwellings in the middle of a parched desert. While he quenches his thirst, Joe watches as an ugly, gigantic Mexican gunman, Chico (Mario Brega of ""Death Rides A Horse""), bangs off shots at the heels of a tiny boy, Jesus (Nino Del Arco), and chases him between the two houses. When Chico reaches the other house, he brutalizes the father, Julián (Daniel Martin of ""The Last Tomahawk""), for letting the lad run loose. Little Jesus was only trying to see his mother, Marisol (Marianne Koch of ""Clint, the Nevada's Loner""), who has been abducted by the gunmen for their boss. This unforgettable opening scene represents the first instance that we're watching a different kind of western. Spaghetti westerns were notoriously violent yet seldom as sanguine as Sam Peckinpah's oaters. The chief reason ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is not three times as bloody is that Leone was working on a low-budget and couldn't afford such luxuries. Joe watches all of this transpire with mild curiosity. Unlike an American western hero, he doesn't intervene, at least until later. Joe rides into the arid hamlet of San Miguel near the Mexican border on his mule and a corpse astride a horse with the sign 'Adios, Amigo' passes him. No sooner has Joe gotten into town than four trigger-happy cowboys spook his mule with their gunfire. Joe grabs an overhanging pole and swings crucifixion style on it as Silvanito (José Calvo of ""Twice a Judas"") steps out of his tavern to watch. Silvanito prepared food and drink for him and talks about San Miguel and its reputation for death. He explains that the town has two bosses, the Rojos and the Baxters. Joe gets a better look at the town from the second-story balcony and concocts a plan after Silvanito tells him that the Rojos are stronger than the Baxters. He ambles back down the street and kills all four of them. What differs here is that Joe draws first and faster and kills them all. The entire shoot-out is captured in a long shot with Joe fanning his revolver in the foreground.Afterward, Joe plays both ends against the middle. The Rojos, lead by Gian Maria Volontè as Ramón Rojo, sell liquor to the Indians, while with the Baxters, led by Consuelo Baxter (Margarita Lozano), sell guns. Their respective houses face each other at either end of the street. Ramón wields a Winchester repeating rifle with devastating accuracy and always shoots for the heart. He boasts that ""When a man with a .45 meets a man with a rifle, the man with the rifle wins."" Initially, Ramón is not in town when Joe goes to work for his older brother Don Miguel Rojo (Antonio Prieto of ""The Sword of Zorro"") and moves in with their gunmen until he hears Ramón's murderous younger brother Esteban (Sieghardt Rupp of ""The Killer Likes Candy"") talk about killing him and retrieving the money. Meanwhile, a Mexican Army escort passes through San Miguel with a mysterious wagon. Later, the Mexican Army escort meets with the U.S. Calvary at the Rio Bravo, but the Americans have been killed and Ramón and his men are impersonating them. Ramón wipes out the Mexican soldiers to the last man with a machine gun. Sergio Leone displays his flair for visuals as well as storytelling in ""A Fistful of Dollars."" Ramón qualifies as the best kind of villain because he is dangerous, but Ramón's pride at ""aiming for the heart"" is what leads to his destruction. Ennio Morricone's distinctive music sets ""A Fistful of Dollars"" apart from all Spaghetti westerns and established new conventions for the genre. Clint Eastwood plays the anti-heroic Joe with glacial calm and Gian Maria Volontè is simply brilliant as Ramón. A number of people collaborated on the screenplay, among them Sergio Leone, Fernando Di Leo of ""Wipe Out!,"" Duccio Tessari of ""A Pistol for Ringo,"" Víctor Andrés Catena of ""Three Sergeants of Bengal,"" Jaime Comas Gil of ""Danger! Death Ray and even Clint Eastwood. Despite all these scribes, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" boasts several memorable lines.",A Fistful of Dollars

Being a spaghetti western, expect a few plot holes, strange turns, very weak acting, but some fun. This fits that bill.The script and Sergio Leone's direction is pretty basic. Eastwood is great in the lead role but the supporting cast are useless. Some of the most unconvincing acting you will ever see. The kid probably takes the prize for the worst acting performance ever. However, not entirely unenjoyable. Has its moments and not a waste of time. Vastly overrated though.",A Fistful of Dollars
24,Boba_Fett1138,The birth of a new genre.,8,30 May 2008,"It's not exactly as if this was the first spaghetti-western ever made but it was the movie that became the first mainstream success and pretty much marked the beginning of the success of a popular new genre. It was also the movie that launched Clint Eastwood's career as a leading man in movie roles. Before this he mostly played background characters in movies and had about 2 lines and he starred in a couple of TV-series, of which ""Rawhide"" is the best known example and is pretty much the reason who he got his role in this movie.I liked this movie a tad bit better than its first sequel of the 'dollar-trilogy'; ""Per qualche dollaro in più"" because the story had a bit more substance and the movie was less dark of tone. Of course it's not as good as its final sequel ""Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" but then again, which western is?The movie does not has an original story do, since this movie is an unofficial remake of the Japanese Kurosawa movie ""Yojimbo"". Director Akira Kurosawa and writer Ryuzo Kikushima even successfully sued but luckily the movie still got its release. Imaging if this movie wouldn't had been around and it would had been canceled. It perhaps would had meant the end of Sergio Leone's career and definitely the end of the spaghetti-western's, even before the genre took off.It's a great story with some great genre characters in it, that basically is about the ancient theme of good versus evil, which really is the story in a nutshell.The movie is directed with lots of style but it also became apparent that director Sergio Leone had yet to perfect his style. There are some trademark elements present, mostly with its compositions and long shots of people's faces but it's not really completely the style yet he became so famous for.It's mostly Clint Eastwood that makes this movie. Can you even imaging this movie without him? Casting him in the lead role was like the best thing since the invention of the Internet. Seriously though, he acts superbly in this film and he fits his role like a glove. It marked for him the beginning of a great long career of acting in movies, of course mostly also western's.A great early genre example!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",A Fistful of Dollars
25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"The first part of the famous Dollars Trilogy, and one of the best Westerns",8,8 August 2004,"Sergio Leone made some of the best and most well-made Westerns in his career, and this one is no exception. It's the first part of his Dollars trilogy, and, in my opinion, superior to the second part, For a Few Dollars More. I can't say if I prefer it to the third part, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, since it's been too long since I saw that, but I'll re-watch and review that one soon, and then I'll clarify my position on each of the films in the trilogy. The film is widely known as the first spaghetti-Western; that isn't true, as far as I know. It's not the first spaghetti-Western, it's just the first that became internationally known. Not to say that that isn't an accomplishment for Leone too, though; after the films release, everyone wanted to make spaghetti-Westerns. The plot is great; it deals with The Man With No Name who arrives in a small town, finds out that it's run by two major families, and decides to make money by turning them against each other. It's not terribly fast-paced, but it's more interesting than the second movie, and less dragging than the third. The action is also great; it might be slightly inferior to that of the third film, but only slightly. The score, and especially the theme, is inferior to that of the third film, but that's not to say that the theme or score of this film isn't good; it's just not as good as the theme/score of the third film. The acting is good, and in some scenes, great. I didn't find all of the performances great, though, but none were entirely terrible. The characters were all credible and well-written, despite the fact that a few of them are(or has since become) Western cliches. All in all, a great spaghetti-Western, and a must-see for any fan of Clint Eastwood and/or Sergio Leone. I recommend it to fans of spaghetti-Westerns, Sergio Leone and/or Clint Eastwood. 8/10",A Fistful of Dollars
26,view_and_review,Two Families and a Stranger,8,19 February 2019,"I've just taken a journey through cinema history and I liked it. This 1964 classic starred Clint Eastwood playing Joe, a hired gun more-or-less who has put himself right in between two warring families: the Baxters and the Rojos. His reason? Money. Naturally, everything doesn't go smoothly and Joe has to use his wits and his weapon to escape a bad situation.The stakes were heightened because the bad guy, Ramon Rojo (Gian Maria Volonte), is world class wicked. He's the antagonist that you yearn to see killed. And not just simply killed but killed in the most inhumane way. He's the nemesis that--once killed--all is right with the world.

27,Uriah43,Both Ends Against the Middle,7,6 April 2013,"Across the Rio Grande a man named ""Joe"" (Clint Eastwood) rides a mule into the outskirts of a Mexican town and notices a child being mistreated while the young boy's beautiful mother, ""Marisol"" (Marianne Koch) looks on helplessly. He then encounters a rude reception when he continues into the town. Not long afterward he finds that the town is ruled by two rival families. The ""Rojos"" deal in liqueur while the ""Baxters"" trade in guns. Realizing that there is some money to be made by playing both ends against the middle, Joe decides to offer his services to one side and then the other. Now, while this is a very enjoyable film it does have a few scenes which strain reality. One such scene involved two Mexican soldiers in a graveyard who just sit there without any reaction while gunfire was raging all around them. Even though they were already dead, the fact that nobody on either side realized that something was wrong is sort of far-fetched. Another scene happened at the very end when one of the bandits named ""Ramon Rojo"" (Gian Maria Volonte) kept firing at Joe's chest and never once aimed anywhere else even though it was clearly not having much effect. Now, don't get me wrong, it was quite entertaining. But it stretched the boundaries of believability just a bit.

29,Wuchakk,Introducing the Spaghetti Western super-human caricature killing machine,5,25 September 2017,"RELEASED IN 1964 and directed by Sergio Leone, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" stars Clint Eastwood as an expert gunman who drifts into a Mexican town where he finds himself in the middle of a war between two factions, the gun-running gringo Baxters and the firewater-running Hispanic Rojos. The story's based on Akira Kurosawa's 1961 samurai flick, ""Yojimbo,"" which was patterned after the work of John Ford, so ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is an Itala copy of a Jap imitation of an American Western (!). Interestingly, Kurosawa sued Leone, but it never went to court. It ended with a settlement of $100,000 and 15% of the revenue of ""Fistful"" for Kurosawa.Speaking of ripping off (or homages), Ennio Morricone's excellent score (as usual) features a moving piece obviously inspired by Dimitri Tiomkin's outstanding ""El Degüello"" from ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). Compare the two.The opening act is great and is probably why so many people fondly remember this movie, but the middle act is weak. It starts with a thrilling massacre of dozens of Mexican soldiers, albeit curiously bloodless, carried out by a machine gun the likes of which the Earth has never seen (until this movie). For instance, it has multiple muzzles, like a Gatling gun, yet nothing revolves. I could go on, but I'll have mercy.This sequence is followed by a gunfight near a graveyard where members of the factions are absurdly fooled by two motionless corpses placed there earlier by Joe (Eastwood). Why sure! The final act is marred by another unbelievable scene where Joe boldly faces the main antagonist in a showdown. He has total faith in something that protects him with zero concern that any other part of his body besides his central torso might be hit. Why sure! Someone might argue that Joe KNEW Ramón Rojo would only aim for the heart, but there were several other lethal heavies present. How did he know they weren't going to shoot? Speaking of Ramón, Gian Maria Volontè is charismatic in the role, but he's even better in the follow-up, ""For a Few Dollars More"" (1965), as a wholly different character.Other problems include bad English dubbing, cartoony gore, the camera's curious infatuation with close-ups of sweaty, maniacal countenances and no female character of much note, although Marianne Koch and Margarita Lozano appear in small roles.There's this myth going around that Leone's Dollars trilogy introduced the concept of the antihero, otherwise known as the ""good (or likable) bad man."" Actually, the antihero had been around for decades when ""Fistful"" was released in '64. Take, for example, John Wayne's Ringo Kid in ""Stagecoach"" (1939) or Richard Widmark's Comanche Todd in ""The Last Wagon"" (1956) or Anthony Quinn's Bob Kallen in ""The Ride Back"" (1957) and, particularly, Brando's Kid Rio in ""One-Eyed Jacks"" (1961). These are just off the top of my head.The difference with Eastwood's antihero in Leone's so-called Man With No Name trilogy is that, unlike the antiheroes above, he is without personality, unless squinting, shooting, killing and smoking cheroots are taken as profound marks of character. In Short, Leone introduced the antihero CARICATURE as opposed to the antihero CHARACTER. Cool caricatures with superhuman bravery & abilities work just fine when you're in your teens or early 20s, but after you mature a bit you naturally desire more three-dimensional and believable characters.""A Fistful of Dollars"" is worth checking out for its engaging first act and its iconic place in Western history, but there are superior Eastwood Westerns, such as the two Leone non-sequels (1965 & 1966 respectively), ""Hang 'em High"" (1968), ""Two Mules for Sister Sara"" (1970), ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976), ""Pale Rider"" (1985) and ""Unforgiven"" (1992).THE MOVIE RUNS 99 minutes and was shot in Almería, Andalucía, & Madrid, Spain; and Rome, Italy.GRADE: C",A Fistful of Dollars
30,zetes,"Decent, but doesn't hold a candle to Yojimbo",6,22 April 2000,"A Fistfull of Dollars has its moments, but the original film, Kurosawa's Yojimbo, was much better. Clint Eastwood, though very good, is no Toshiro Mifune. Mifune's nameless man had much more of a character and a personality than his ever-scowling counterpart, Eastwood. The supporting characters were much more interesting in Yojimbo, also. The gunslinger in that film was much cooler than Ramone (whom I believe to be the counterpart in A Fistfull of Dollars, but I'm not sure). Even Christopher Walken in Last Man Standing, a pretty terrible movie, was more interesting than Ramone. Also, the bell ringer, the undertaker, and the bartender were all more interesting in Yojimbo. Fistfull is also not as much fun as Yojimbo. That one was more playful. This on is more gruesome. The music was great in the original, and the score here is a tad bit annoying and overused.

So I can't agree with the high ratings it gets even though it's a movie from 1964. The quality of the story is just not there, it's kind of stupid and don't make much sense. A small town with barely twenty houses, two gangs living next to each other, it's just too stupid to be credible. The soundtrack is the best thing about A Fistful Of Dollars, the cinematography isn't bad, neither is the acting but the story just brings the score down. Sergio Leone is the master of spaghetti western and this debut set the tone for what was to come in the future. I think he learned a lot of lessons on how to better his movies afterwards. That said I always enjoy watching Clint Eastwood and those old westerns, but this one is just not my favorite. The ratings are just too high compared to the other masterpieces.

32,Mr-Fusion,"The movie that reignited the Western, and sent Eastwood's star into orbit",7,2 November 2012,"Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" takes a while to get going, but it thankfully kicks into gear in the second half. Essentially a reworking of Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"", ""Dollars"" is the uncomplicated story of a loner (Eastwood) who drifts into a dusty border town governed by two rival gangs, and enterprisingly plays one off of the other. You could argue that ""Dollars"" is style over substance, but in this case the style IS the substance. The film is notable for Leone's stamp on the genre, a stamp that has its own wry sense of humor and distinctive visual style. It de-romanticized the Western but also showed off some expansive and impressive landscape photography. Leone's West is an arid, gritty place, with peoples' faces caked in sweat and grime. And the hero is a mean bastard. Eastwood's Joe is a laconic gunslinger, often using his weapon to do the talking for him. We're to assume this man has no past (and for most of the movie, he has no backstory, save for a short throwaway line that paints an unexpectedly vivid picture). The character (and the movie, in general) play to Eastwood's gifts as an actor. The only thing I have against this film (aside from the sluggish first half) is the score. I can't help it, I've never been a Morricone fan. But I will say that he is nothing short of iconic. You hear that flute, and you instantly think ""Spaghetti Western"". 7/10",A Fistful of Dollars
33,christopher-underwood,an iconic central figure (albeit with no name) is being established,7,12 September 2020,"It is easy, watching this today, to be dismissive, to criticise the lack of story, lack of female interest and lack of moral outcome. But even though it is now almost sixty years since this film was made, its modernity, its radical break from the established American western tradition and the indisputable influence upon action films generally is clear to see. It appears a little mannered, a little measured and those little quirks in Eastwood's performance, the squint, the reluctant drag on the cigar, the mumbled and limited verbal responses are all there, in embryo. Although essentially just a film with guys shooting each other an iconic central figure (albeit with no name) is being established within an evocative landscape of mountain, desert and dusty streets but peppered with the characterful faces of those about to die. Another big difference from most films that came before this was the music. it is not that the score is particularly wonderful or inspiring but that it has been very deliberately created in conjunction with the imagery, that whether written before or after shooting, is an integral part of the creative process and this would happen much more in the future, not just with Morricone but others that would follow in his footsteps. This may have been nicked from Kurosawa's Yojimo (1961) but its own world influence would ultimately be even greater. Part of the settlement after the Japanese director took legal action was that he ended up with Japanese distribution rights to the Dollars films, something nicely ironic about that.",A Fistful of Dollars

However, Clint Eastwood was just starting out his career and was relatively unknown, but his performance in this film launched his career to great stardom. In this film, Clint is called Joe, but really has no name and stumbles into this small Western town which is ruled by two evil gangs who control everything and killing goes on every day as the way of living. The undertaker is constantly making coffins and works day in and day out. In one scene Clint is beaten up so badly his face looks like a bloody pulp or a smashed tomato. There is plenty of action which never seems to stop and this goes on from the very beginning to the very end.

35,JamesHitchcock,Perhaps remembered more for its influence than for its intrinsic merits,6,17 November 2008,"Although ""A Fistful of Dollars"" was not the first Spaghetti Western, it was the first to bring the genre to international attention. ""Spaghetti Western"" was originally an insult coined by US critics who were offended by the temerity of Italian film-makers in daring to tackle this quintessentially American genre, but later became a more neutral description of Westerns made in Europe. Actually, as most of these films were Italian/Spanish co-productions, and many of them were filmed in Spain, the title ""Paella Western"" would have been just as appropriate.This was also the film that made a major star of Clint Eastwood. It was the first film in Sergio Leone's ""dollars trilogy""; Eastwood was to star in the other two, ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"". His character in all three films is billed as ""The Man with No Name"", although here that is not quite accurate as he is referred to in the film itself as Joe, and represents a new breed of Western hero.Most previous Western heroes, as played by the likes of John Wayne, Alan Ladd or Gregory Peck, were heroic in both senses of the word. They were not only physically courageous but also morally virtuous, standing up for ideals of honour and justice against the villains. Some films had heroes who were morally flawed, such as Howard Kemp, James Stewart's character in ""The Naked Spur"", but the films themselves still took a moralistic line, with these flaws condemned as moral weaknesses. By the end of ""The Naked Spur"" Kemp has undergone redemption though a change of heart.The Man with No Name, by contrast, was deliberately presented as an amoral anti-hero. He is courageous, but does not stand for any idealistic moral principles. He is occasionally capable of altruism, but most of the time is motivated by self-interest. He is a hard-bitten, mercenary, laconic loner. Eastwood also gave him a distinctive physical appearance, characterised by his trademark poncho and cigar. He also sports a beard or stubble, whereas most earlier Western heroes had been clean-shaven.The plot of ""For a Fistful of Dollars"" is said to be based upon the Japanese film ""Yojimbo"", although I cannot comment as I have never seen that film. Joe arrives in the Mexican border town of San Miguel. The town is dominated by two rival families, the Rojos and the Baxters, who make their money out of a lucrative trade in smuggling contraband into the US. Joe, a skilled gunfighter, sees this as a business opportunity, and plays the two sides off against one another, undertaking various jobs for both families while showing loyalty to neither. His mistake comes, however, when he for once performs a good deed. Ramon, the most violent of the Rojo brothers, has taken as his mistress a young married woman named Marisol, forcing her against her will to abandon her husband and young child. Joe helps her and her family to escape, and Ramon vows vengeance.""A Fistful of Dollars"" is one of those films which is perhaps better remembered for its influence on later films than for its intrinsic merits. It is one of the first ""revisionist ""Westerns"", marking the start of a trend towards not only moral ambiguity but also a more realistic depiction of violence, shown not only in the shoot-outs, more messy and less clean-cut than those in many previous films, but also in the scenes where Joe is tortured by Rojos' thugs. This revisionist line was to become commonplace in the Westerns of the late sixties and early seventies; Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" is a good example of a film which shows the influence of Leone's work.The film was originally shot without sound, with a soundtrack being dubbed on later. This was common practice in the Italian film industry and this time, as it allowed versions to be produced in different languages for the home and foreign markets. (Even in English the film is sometimes referred to by its Italian title ""Per un Pugno di Dollari""). The dubbing, however, is not always convincingly done, and it is all too obvious that some of the characters are mouthing words which bear no relation to what we actually hear. The action is also at times over-leisurely and difficult to follow. Although Eastwood shows the talent and charisma which would make him a major star, the film today seems little more than a run-of-the-mill Western. Nevertheless, in the sixties it must have seemed to American audiences like something fresh and exciting. 6/10",A Fistful of Dollars
36,Red-Barracuda,The template spaghetti western,8,22 April 2011,"This is a pretty important western. It was the breakthrough film from Sergio Leone and the first of his Dollars films, it has a star-making role for Clint Eastwood and it's the film that set the spaghetti western sub-genre in motion. It was also the earliest film to indicate soundtrack maestro Ennio Morricone's genius. A Fistful of Dollars is therefore of great historical significance. Despite all this, it only shows hints of how great Leone's films were to become, and is easily the least of his 60's westerns. This isn't intended as a slight, however, as the standard of these other films is extremely high; A Fistful of Dollars is a great western by anybody else's standards.The story of a lone gun-slinger who wanders into a run-down border town and plays off the two ruling families is quite basic. What elevates it though is the cinematic style Leone brings to proceedings. It's beautifully photographed with a great use of widescreen. The film also introduces his use of the extreme close-up of faces. The Mexican gang in particular are shot in this way. And what an amazing selection of faces. These guys look bad. They are very authentic looking villains indeed with the faces to match. Gian Maria Volonté is a terrific lead villain, while the rest of the gang are perfectly cast. Clint Eastwood makes a good impression in his first major starring role, and it's easy to see why he became popular.A Fistful of Dollars is very much an Italian western in other ways. It's noticeably violent for its time and it introduce nastier villains than was normal for the traditional western. I guess the Italians were re-interpreting an American genre through European eyes. The result was a west that was a lot less idealized. Its towns and characters were tough people, who actually looked like they lived there. This has meant that this film, as well as Leone's others have aged much better than a lot of older westerns. A Fistful of Dollars is a must for western fans.",A Fistful of Dollars

38,OllieSuave-007,"Good, entertaining western.",8,27 July 2015,"This is an exciting western starring Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name, who tries to make a fortune off of pitting two rivaling families (Rojos and Baxters) by playing them against each other, and trying to save the town from the greed and revenge in the process.Eastwood gave a solid performance as the gun-totting cowboy, providing much action, wit and a dose humor in a film full of drama and twists. I'm not too huge a fan of westerns, but I believe Director Sergio Leone gave us a very adventurous, well-paced film with unpredictable moments that captures your interest. It is fun to watch Eastwood's methods of operation as he deals with the two families, thinking what cards to play to get them to defeat each other. However, I just thought one gang was way more evil than the other, which made it unbalanced because you're actually rooting for one gang over the other.Ennio Morricone gave a very catchy music score, perfect for a western movie and matching one of Eastwood's most iconic movie roles well.Overall, it's a good, entertaining western to watch.Grade B",A Fistful of Dollars

40,bensonmum2,"""Get three coffins ready.""",8,7 July 2007,"A Fistful of Dollars is often incorrectly called the first Euro or Italian or Spaghetti Western. In fact, there were a number of Euro-Westerns made prior to Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. However, in comparison with Leone's first Western, the few Euro-Westerns I've seen tend to be little more than copies of American Westerns. Instead, Leone was first to usher in a new style of Western. Leone created a less romanticized Western where characters had faults, got dirty, and bled. A Western where the line between the good guys and the bad guys was blurred. A Western where events were unpredictable. A Western where the violence was over-the-top. The Spaghetti Westerns like A Fistful of Dollars may have had little in common with the real Old West, but neither did the Hollywood Western. And I'm not sure that Leone and the rest cared that their films lacked historical accuracy. The real West wasn't their inspiration  the Hollywood Westerns were their inspiration. These were entertainment pieces first and foremost. And if the audiences of the 1960s were entertained by this new style Western, Leone was going to give it to them.It's impossible to mention A Fistful of Dollars and not discuss the genius of Sergio Leone. In this movie, you can see early examples of directorial flourishes that would become Leone trademarks. The extreme close-ups followed by enormous widescreen shots, the extended showdowns, and the use of music as an integral part of a film can be seen in his first Western effort. But just as amazing and genius as Leone and just as important to the success of A Fistful of Dollars is Ennio Morricone's score. I'm sure audiences familiar the Hollywood style of scoring were shocked by Morricone's music with its series of whistles, chirps, and other experimental sounds. It was a new sound for a new kind of Western. And it's brilliant.At its core, A Fistful of Dollars is a very simple movie. The plot is simple (and even more so if you've seen Yojimbo). Clint Eastwood rides into town and discovers two warring factions. He uses the animosity they have for each other for his own gain. Like I said, it's simple. But the film's simplicity extends beyond the plot. Partially for budgetary reasons and partially the result of some judicious cutting and editing, there's very little in the way of fat. For example, the dialogue in A Fistful of Dollars is often very minimal. Considering the fact that he's the lead performer, Clint Eastwood's character has very few lines. Instead, Leone and Eastwood allow a look, an action, or a note from Morricone's incredible score to speak for Clint. Simple? - yes, but very effective.Beyond Leone's direction, Morricone's score, and the style of the Spaghetti Western, A Fistful of Dollars excels in several other areas - especially the acting. For the budget the film was made on, the acting is superb. Eastwood and his minimalist ""Man with No Name"" may be the known quantity, but there are other, equally impressive performances in the movie. Chief among them is Gian Maria Volontè as the crazed Ramon. It's an amazing piece of work. As much as I enjoy Eastwood, it's Volontè that makes the movie for me.Finally (and I'll end here because I could probably go on writing all night) I sometimes wonder if Leone or Eastwood or anyone involved with A Fistful of Dollars had any idea of what they were doing. Did they have any notion that more than 40 years later these movies would be more beloved than when they were made? I sincerely doubt it. I'll never forget the night I discovered Leone's Dollar Trilogy. I was in college in the early 80s and WGN was playing A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More back-to-back. I was blown away! My conception of what a Western was changed that night. And I've been a huge fan every since.Thank you, Mr. Leone.",A Fistful of Dollars
41,lost-in-limbo,The price of loyalty is something you can't afford.,9,19 September 2009,"A true catalyst for the sub-genre that paved the way for an influential influx of imitators, but Sergio Leone would always be considered the visionary grandfather of the bruising Italian spaghetti western and deservedly so. Going on to change the face of the western frontier, I never grow old of these features. 'A Fistful of Dollars' would be the first of the dollar trilogy (or ""The Man with No name"" some like to call), and for me the weakest of the three (as to follow was my favourite 'For A Few Dollars More' and then the phenomenally grand 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'). Being the weakest isn't a true indication of how good it truly is, as it does stand head over heels over many other films of its type and goes on to show how strong a trio these films are. Not only did it make a name for Leone, it's virtually unknown leading American man Clint Eastwood would become an iconic figure with this character, which after a stint in TV would finally help him to get his foot into Hollywood and engrave a recognizable face around the world. His presence felt just right, as I couldn't really see anyone else (ah, possibly Charles Bronson who would star a couple years later in Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West'). His lean physic, blistering squint and lethal gun skills, made his character an unforgettable symbol. At times cold (with a very calculative way-of-thinking), but managing to show some warmth without really letting us in. A ruggedly swift and concise performance on Eastwood's part. He's a one-man show, in what is a scene filled with individuals. The dialogue is hard-bitten, straight-forward with a lot of short exchanges (where the stranger known as Joe or Americana spinning the own words of others back on them in some shape), but Leone likes the sweepingly expressive and fiery camera-work (framed by Massimo Dallamano) to capture the reactions/or mind-sets. Focusing on the eyes, facials and body gestures was just as important as or more so than what words could convey. Just as important to this is Ennio Morricone's rhythmically uncanny, but rousing score that can tell its own story by it heighten emotional weight in the end the simple plot (which has the concept taken off Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo' but who cares when it's done this is good) feels quite secondary, less flamboyant to everything else, but still would remain the backbone to holding it all together.Something about watching Eastwood set his plan in motion by being secretly the third party working both sides (two rival bands of smugglers bidding for power in one town) for the right price, and then sitting back as they drop like flies to finally leave his imprint is captivating. Accountable to Leone's unsparingly raw, but spiritedly tidy style whipping out brutally lashing violence with a venomously sharp humorous glee streaming through. It's all striking imagery as if ignited by a fuse, as he turns the conventions upside down in a dramatically decorative and quickly paced manner. The gritty realism is brought alive by such earthy, grim and sooty locations to lively stage these dangerously imaginative and suspenseful showdowns. The performances are finely displayed. Gian Maria Volontè is outstanding as the intense, but articulate Ramon. Likewise for José Calvo as the bar-owner. Leone paints an ugly looking western, that doesn't care for the straight line of good or bad in what is an unforgiving paradise that expects you to do anything to look after your own skin to gain the upper hand in what less than perfect character arks. Tightly ground-breaking and extremely top-rate entertainment.",A Fistful of Dollars
42,Robert_duder,"A thrill ride Western that keeps you enthralled, Eastwood is tops!!",9,1 August 2006,"A Fistful of Dollars is generally considered director Sergio Leone's leap into Hollywood, not to mention rocketing a small time TV Star to western fame and a Hollywood career surpassing nearly everyone else. It is plain and simple easy to see why Fistful of Dollars has become such an utter classic and there is three main things that make this film exactly what it is and on top of that makes the follow up films (which are not sequels) equally as brilliant. The first is the star Mr. Clint Eastwood. Eastwood is the exact definition of cool. The man oozes masculinity and there is never anyone faster with a gun, tougher in a fight, or more modest on screen to always allow his character to get the crap beat out of him at least once because he always comes back. The second is the extreme talent of Director Sergio Leone who was way ahead of his time. If Mr. Leone were alive today and given the 100-200 million dollar action budget of Hollywood the man would be an absolute superstar. I say this because he made incredible western, action flicks of budgets of less than one million dollars. In fact Fistful of Dollars was more for approximately 200 THOUSAND DOLLARS and it's one of the most entertaining action flicks I've seen in ages. You would never know the low budget with the exception of the sound being off a little in some places. The third thing is the western atmosphere. To someone who is not a fan of westerns then Fistful of Dollars would likely bore you to pieces. Myself...I just recently became a fan, discovered through my love of Eastwood as an actor that I love Westerns and Fistful of Dollars is the quintessential Western but set in Mexico.Clint Eastwood is the man with no name again...although he is referred to as Joe, so I'm not sure why he has no name?? Anyways Eastwood is the fast gunned, smart talker who sees that there is some money to be made in a small Mexican town by playing two rich families of smugglers against each other. ""The Rojo's on one side, the Baxter's on the other and me in the middle...sound like there is money to be made."" Eastwood's character this time around is a little lighter than others. He's not as dark and brooding and even has a bite of sarcasm and humor to him at times. Out of all of his Stranger performances this is his most fun and most watchable because he's a cinematic hero. Quick witted, and action oriented. Gian Maria Volontè plays the head of the Rojo family, Ramon. He is set up as a bit of a villainous hero in the area until Eastwood saunters along to make him eat his words. He is very good as Ramon and definitely the more evil of the two families. Sieghardt Rupp plays Ramon's brother Esteban and although he is not quite as villainous he does a good job in his role as well.The rest of the cast all play their roles very well in one way or another however small. The film flows at breakneck speed and every scene is riveting and compelling. The film reminded me a great deal of another great movie from a few years back with Bruce Willis called Last Man Standing. I just discovered now that indeed both Fistful of Dollars and Last Man Standing were based on the same 1927 story which explains the comparisons. If you're a fan of Westerns you'll love the gun fights and the ambiance they have created and a sub story regarding the American forces being set up during a gun deal and if you just love action films you'll love the in depth and incredible story of two families with Eastwood in the middle turning them against each other. It's definitely one of my favorites from here on in. 9/10",A Fistful of Dollars
43,ElMaruecan82,"The rebirth of a genre, in the name of Leone, Eastwood and the Holy Morricone ...",9,7 September 2011,"The iconic whistle that opens ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is simple, catchy and poetically comical in its ludicrous attempt to compete with the triumphant fanfares of Elmer Bernstein or the classic Fordian riding symphonies... but still, this music announces the birth of one of the most recognizable and spectacular movie sub-genres, a cinematic oddity whose strong Mediterranean consonances would earn it the derogatory name of Western Spaghetti, beneath which was delivered a new taste cooked up by two visionary geniuses.It's impossible to describe Sergio Leone's creation without evoking the crucial contribution of Ennio Morricone, probably one of the few cases where the work of the film-maker and the composer are equally significant. And not to diminish Leone's directorial merits, but the element that immediately pleases our senses the first minutes we're plunged into the film is definitely the music. Morricone has an extraordinary ability to absorb each of your perceptions and tactfully plug them into the right emotions, and not without creative innovations on a technical level.Morricone's music enriches the wordless content of the film with so many whip sounds, gunshots, chorus, and of course the whistle, over and over again, indicating a threatening presence, or a Chinese-like violin sound the brutal manifestation of something stranger, even creepier. The music pulls the strings of a wide range of emotions from the harmonica's melancholic slowness to the flute's solemnity, from the trumpets' inspirational melody to the heart-pounding vibrancy of the suspenseful drums. And the subtle touch of genius resonates through the sound of the electric guitar, every once in a while, as to underline the inner modernity governing Leone's reinvention of the Western genre. As you may have noticed, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is one of my all-time favorite scores.But the music is only one of the brushes with which Leone's painted an incredibly iconoclast piece of art. The music literally influenced the directing because it was made before the film's release, so the scenes had to fit the length and the pacing of the melodies. That's why we can't reasonably dissociate the score with the film. Actually, even the many aspects from the directing serve the purpose of the story, Leone's films are made with such a masterful artistry that there's no way to analyze every cinematic element separately. It's a harmonious and perfectly symbiotic creation that doesn't lie about its roots, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is a Western and a damn good one, but that also loudly and proudly shouts ""This is no Ford or Hawks! This is the roaring Leone!""Leone revolutionized the Western by emphasizing the vastness of the landscapes through extended views and hypnotic close-ups, the Goya-like ugliness of his characters, with creepy looks, bushy beards and the unforgettably sweaty and fearsome face of Gian Maria Volonte, magnetic in his antagonistic role. From his two trademarks, Leone underlines two important elements of the story: it takes place in a small town far from the civilized world and populated by men who carry on their face the nastiness inherited from a long absence of God and Law. The place is hopeless, with no chances of survival for the weak, the unarmed, women, children...Leone aesthetically depicts the savagery of a world that has been too exaggeratedly celebrated through the conquest of the West, the good old pioneers, the Marshall or lone ranger protecting the innocent civilians. Leone's film visits the antipodes of the Western genre providing the perfect alibi for the glorious and almost operatic amount of bloody and spectacular violence displayed all through the film. And if it wasn't for the last element of the Holy trinity, there would have been absolutely no redeeming qualities. Leone, Morricone were relatively unknown names when the movie was made, but this was nothing compared to Clint Eastwood, who wasn't even the first choice to play the role, a former TV star who acted in some B-Western movies. But never would the cinematic Gods have deprived the audience from such a face, such a character. A supposedly good guy who, in a thought-provoking approach from the script, doesn't even help a brutalized man in the opening scene, the cynical and anti-heroic tone is set.In a way, his classic good looks makes him almost archetypal, but like many Leone's protagonists, he's only good because he's less bad than the others, and carries one or two principles in his pocket. The Man with No Name is stingy on words, but his eyes say everything, his body language is austere and restrained, all he needs to build an attitude is one look, a way to handle a cigar, to wear his hat or not to. The Man embodies the menacing climate where any word, any action out of place would lead to disaster.The whole plot is indeed a poker and chess game where the only heroism is inspired by a detached and opportunistic cynicism, it's about one man who'll take advantage of a situation where two rival families confront each other in an endless war, where the only prospect of richness come from the 'undertaking' department. The movie is not without subtle ounces of black comedy, where the undertaker with his hyena-like giggle reminds of the futility of death as to better repress its gravity.The story of ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is adapted from Akira Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"" , probably superior for the purists, but as much as I love and respect Kurosawa, I prefer his ""Sanjuro"" as a more fitting Samurai story while I'm sure ""Yojinbo"" was begging to be adapted in a Western, and I'm most thankful for Master Kurosawa for having contributed to the resurrection of a genre his movies unconsciously belonged to. And -again- the music was also an extraordinary homage to these epic Japanese films where the actions, the looks, the environment spoke more eloquently than words.",A Fistful of Dollars

There's no doubt 'A Fistful Of Dollars (1964)' is an amazing and stylish spaghetti western that stands out as a staple of the wider genre, though. There are times when the plot drags a little and it isn't told as neatly as it could be, but no other director can eek so much tension from people just staring at one another, and the final shootout is one of the best of its kind.

45,ThomasDrufke,Building Some Coffins,7,4 June 2015,"A Fistful of Dollars marks the first film in the 'Man With No Name' trilogy and also launched Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone's careers. There's a whole lot to like about this film, even if it is pretty much a remake of Yojimbo. Westerns were really big back then and they still could be now. In many ways this film is an example of how to execute a western. You build a spectacle around great characters and an interesting story. Superhero films are the new westerns and probably contribute to why we just don't have many westerns anymore. But at least we have many old westerns, like this one, to go back and enjoy from time to time.Clint Eastwood stars as 'Joe', but really he's just a stranger who gets caught up in a local towns family feud, and works the conflict to benefit himself but also improve the lives of the helpless people in the town. I really like how contained this film is compared to other westerns. Don't get me wrong, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of the greatest films of all time, but there's something to be said about a film that keeps its story centered around one small town and is able to keep the film as compelling as a film that gives a bigger scope. Of course, because of the Morricone and Leone team, we have a brilliant score that compliments the film very well. You can hear the hints of the theme from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly and it works to its benefit. The film also gives us a great supporting cast and a dang good villain. I like Yojimbo, but I feel like the performance of Gian Maria Volonte as Ramon Rojo was superior to Yojimbo's lead villain. I also love Joe's friends, the few that he has, and the subtle comedic relief that they provide the film.So even though this is usually looked at as the weakest film of the three, I still had a great time with it. Especially the third act and the final gunfight. Eastwood once again proves that he was just about as smooth as any actor around this time and Leone & Morricone show us just how great they end up becoming in the following years.+Morricone's score +Final gunfight +Contained spectacle +Ramon 7.9/10",A Fistful of Dollars

He has the look of a rattlesnake in Leone's tight shots, exudes confidence and is tough, and yet he's also wryly playful. His best lines occur early on, when he calls out four men for trying to intimidate him by shooting at his mule when he rode into town. He says, ""I don't think it's nice, you laughin'. You see, my mule don't like people laughing. He gets the crazy idea you're laughin' at him. Now if you apologize, like I know you're going to, I might convince him that you really didn't mean it."" It's easy to see why this film and the rest of the Spaghetti Western films which shortly followed established Eastwood as a star. His poncho and thin black cigars are also iconic.Leone's direction is also strong. He creates a gritty, dark mood in this film, combines those tight shots on his actors with wide panoramas, and makes great use Ennio Morricone's music. The film was shot in Spain and has some gorgeous shots early on, but I would have loved to have seen more of them. The dialogue was clearly dubbed in afterwards, and except for Eastwood, is sometimes hard to understand. José Calvo is good as the innkeeper who befriends Eastwood, but John Wells (Gian Maria Volontè) as the main villain is just average. I was not happy that Leone had pirated Kurosawa's film Yojimbo (1961) to make this one, but tried to keep it out of my mind. It's an entertaining movie, the birth of a great collaboration between Eastwood and Leone, and seems to have been influential to the entire genre, and for all that it's worth watching.",A Fistful of Dollars

I still appreciate the good length and the nice action scenes. They really do sincerely hold up after all these decades. Clint Eastwood obviously makes this movie.

It is an adrenalin rush to watch. I saw it first run in a theatre. At the 16:00 mark after the first shootout, a guy two rows in front stood up and yelled an expletive. He was that excited.2. Launched Sergio Leone, one of the greatest and least appreciated directors of all time. See my IMDb review of ONCE UPON A TIME IN America.3. Launched Ennio Morricone, another top man in his field. I actually purchased the soundtrack to this film, never did that more than three times in my life.4. It rebooted Eastwoods career WHICH was OVER. He took the cash and forgot the movie, even forgot the title, until he heard he was the #1 box office star in Europe. He was stunned.5. It created a new genre of movies, something few films can claim. There were several dozen ""italian westerns"" before the trend expired.6.

51,CuriosityKilledShawn,Gotta get some of that fist.,7,13 January 2012,"It's strange to think that there's never been an honest film adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's 1929 novel Red Harvest. There was an adaptation in 1930 called Roadhouse Nights, however 1961's Yojimbo by Akira Kurosawa was more significant, and subsequently inspired this 1963 Western incarnation (as well as 1996's Last Man Standing).Clint plays his signature man-with-no-name character, who rides into a lonely town where he finds two gangs at war with each other. Feeling that there might be some fistfuls of money to be made from the situation he plays both sides while reaping the benefits and rewards.Since I have seen Last Man Standing many times much of this film was already familiar to me (the similarities are numerous) and therefor didn't draw me in, but I can certainly see the appeal.

53,851222,Classical western,8,15 March 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""A Fistful Of Dollars"" (1964) is a good spaghetti western, the first big release spaghetti western actually. It has everything that one can hope from Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood collaboration. Acting is just good as usual for this material, settings are rich (but not as rich as in next their movies, which will have a bigger budgets), plot is simple yet intriguing, and a Man with no name never misses. Overall, ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" was and still is a great western. It's not a best, but it's a good one. If you like this so called genre, you will like this movie as well. There were some small issues with this movie, like for example a very fake looking blood, some bad acting of dying in a soldiers massacre scene, but these are just a minors complains, witch in later movies by this great tandem will be fixed.

54,Bored_Dragon,The man with no name,10,26 August 2018,"This is the second film by Sergio Leone, one of the biggest names in the western genre, and the first film of his cult ""Dollar Trilogy"". It opens with an animated sequence showing contours of riders, followed with melody by legendary Ennio Morricone. The soundtrack for this movie is a masterpiece of film music that engraves itself in your mind forever. It will be outmatched in the last part of the trilogy by a similar melody, which has become one of the most famous movie compositions of all time.Clint Eastwood is a mysterious nameless gunslinger, who comes into a town ruled by two opposed gangs. Using his incredible revolver skill, as well as intelligent intrigues and traps, he makes the gangs kill each other and wipes off the remains himself. Apparently soulless, cruel, and interested only in dollars, he still acts on the side of the good, but his character remains completely covered with the veil of the mystery. Who he is, where he comes from and what are his motives remains unknown.The film features a mesmerizing camera and directing. Long slow shots shifts with brief flashy action scenes. The story relies more on body language and facial expression than on dialogues, and replicas are short, terse, effective and pervaded by dark humor.10/10Interestingly, the movie cost about $ 200,000, which is equivalent to today's million and a half, which is still a pretty small budget for one of the best movies of all time.",A Fistful of Dollars
55,The-Sarkologist,"Ahh, the Spaghetti Western",6,9 February 2012,"I saw this movie a while back and the one thing that sticks out is the end gunfight where Clint Eastwood walks into town wearing a metal chestplate. This chest plate is designed to stop bullets, which it does. Back to the Future II has this scene playing in the background and Back to the Future III actually uses this in the final confrontation. The plot of this movie has also taken by other movies, especially Last Man Standing, so it has been quite influential.A nameless gunman (Clint Eastwood) wonders into a Mexican Border Town and learns that there is no law and that it is ruled by two rival gangs. The man decides that he can make a lot of money playing both side off against each other and sets about doing that. He ends up causing one to wipe out the other and then turns on the other and destroys them. It is a simple plot but there are some interesting ideas in it.The two gangs are different nationalities: one is run by Americans, Baxter, and the other is run by Mexicans, Ramerez. These two gangs seem to represent the two greater powers on the North American continent, or even the two racial groups being the Hispanic and the Americans. This is confirmed at the end when Eastwood says that he has no desire to get caught up in the politics of the two sides when they meet.Eastwood, though he is American, is the typical lone wolf. He does not show loyalty to either side, and in fact he attacks the American gang first and allies with the Mexican gang, though he has no thought of really helping them. Thus this movie takes a very anti-authoritarian and even chooses to turn against one's own government. Even then this probably takes the side of the right wing in America, which chooses to limit the government. As such we should be free to live as we want to without any government to hinder us. This is not a major point though because instead of trying to destroy that which rules, he chooses to use it for his own personal gain, the idea of capitalism.I would believe that this movie is very right winged, but then most Westerns tend to be. It is about entering a hostile world and taming it. But the era of the Western has gone because now the west has been tamed, they turn to the cities and seek to tame them now. The 70's, 80's and 90's have brought the world from the west and into the city where the violence and adventure now rules for the west has simply become a tame land of farms.",A Fistful of Dollars

57,slightlymad22,The One That Started It All,7,6 March 2017,"Having finished viewing Mel Gibson's Filmography in order, I'm now working my way through the legend that is Clint Eastwood's Filmography starting with A Fistful Of Dollars (1964)Plot In A Paragraph: A stranger (Clint Eastwood) rides into a town torn by war between two factions, the Baxters and the Rojo's. He schemes to play the two sides off each other, getting rich in the bargain.It's impossible to talk about Leone's spaghetti westerns without heading Ennino Morricone's superb score, so I'll start by saying he sets the tone with what is to come right from the opening credits. It's fantastic and he can be simple or inventive either way it's first class.In 1964 Clint was an established TV star, thanks to his role as Rowdy Yates on TV's Rawhide, a role he had played for 5 years and 7 seasons, so to say Clint was already at home playing a cowboy would be an understatement. Needless to say, we are a long way from Rawhide here. Considering what a risk (shooting a low budget Western in Italy and Spain, with a director nobody had heard of, with only one directing credit to his name, who didn't even speak English) this was at the time for Eastwood, he looks great in his now iconic outfit and very confident, We see Clint honing his trademark expressions!! The snarl, the squint and the famous grin!! We also see a rare occasion. Clint take a great deal of punishment in this movie, maybe the most vicious punishment he receives in his entire career.Grossing $14 million A Fistful Of Dollars was the sixth highest grossing movie and 1964. A Massive success given its $200,000 budget.",A Fistful of Dollars

'A Fistful of Dollars' was Clint Eastwood's breakthrough performance and propelled him to super stardom. I can understand that to a certain extent, since he was the film's protagonist. I just didn't like his character, or the way he acted, for that matter.Much too little is known about Joe (Eastwood). We don't know his back story or what his intentions are or were before he decided to help the girl in peril. When she asked him why he was helping her, he replied ""I knew someone like you once, but there was no-one to help"". You would think they'd let us in on more detail, but they don't. This was not enough reason for me, as he had very little to know information about the woman herself.I suppose the film was good in its day, but I found it a bit boring with a lot of credibility issues.",A Fistful of Dollars
59,johnnyboyz,Hugely enjoyable slice of Western film-making which is consistently kept under a tight hold by a director hitting all sorts of form.,8,28 October 2010,"Sergio Leone was on the cusp of a wave when he set out to make 1964's A Fistful of Dollars; a step away from pioneering a new form of Western in which the leads, despite any labelling of 'good', were just as sordid and crooked as those within whom really were rotten to the core. It was a wave during which the emphasis on the word ""Wild"" was very much the focal point of the term ""Wild West"", as hot; grubby; grimy; sweaty locales in which ugly and morally vacant men duelled to the death. For all that was to come, this first of three efforts in the proclaimed 'Dollars' trilogy is surprisingly conformative, a film that will come to tell of a tale involving a lone rider and his wondering into a town before realising something's quite wrong prior to setting out so as to do something about it. If that means putting some pesky, good-for-nothing Mexicans in their place and aid the townsfolk in the process, then so be it. Regardless, the film is a deft but entertaining piece; a wondrous study of a central character coming around to substitute his selfish and methodical ways to fight off misogyny and terrorism – a rock of a performance at the centre of it all and a persistently high level of directing throughout.It is Clint Eastwood here, playing the character it seems he's become synonymous with over the years; this particular incarnation seeing him go by the routine name of Joe after a slight exchange with a friendly on what Eastwood's nameless stranger ought to be called. He' a tall; cigar smoking; poncho clad lone gunslinger whom happens across a Mexican border town named San Miguel, a town stuck in a full-on war between a native Mexican gang named The Rojos that are run by the Rojo brothers as well as a more organised, more law abiding group run by a man named John Baxter (Lukschy). When we first encounter Joe, he just as we catch a glimpse of an act of brutality against a local man whom is killed and then the consequent threat aimed towards his child by the higher-ups linked to the said Mexican gang. Joe doesn't intervene like a more typified justified film lead might, instead smiling at the woman of the family and heading onwards. Did he find the whole sickly scenario rather amusing? Or is it a gesture linked to later action he may or may not take.Arriving in the town, Joe is immediately targeted by a group of men linked to one of the rivalling factions whom taunt him and invade his close space, something that costs them their lives shortly thereafter. We feel the lead is a man not afraid of neither instigating violence nor being outnumbered in a fight, and the relative ease as to which he dispatches this small group of men without getting too emotional about things has us believe his refusal to deal with the horrid scenario from just earlier on suggests he looks out for himself only, crossing only those whom do so to him first. Leone nestles us down in this new locale nicely, establishing what sort of character the lead is; introducing the threat of a young woman whom might spell trouble later on; having local business owners mingle with Joe and, upon joining up with The Rojo's gang, making it so that one of the brothers takes against Eastwood's character on a personal level. Things are both beautifully complicated and furthered when an Army-led coach full of gold coins is stolen by the Mexicans, something that Joe seemingly has his eye on as they're holed up nearby.The film is an affecting documentation of that lone gunslinger being brought out of his robotic and self-obsessed mentality and into something fresher, a later reveal when he frees a certain character from captivity suggesting an ability to confront past demons and put them to bed as he helps somebody out in the mean time. Additionally, there is a sequence much later on involving a large burning building and the decision those within face of either cindering alive inside or running out to a hail of bullets from those surrounding it; a sequence briefly captured from Joe's point of view, or gaze, as he wearily peeks out of a hiding place. There's remorse in his reaction, remorse in his ruffled tone which comes out as a collection moans as he watches the agonising destruction of a group of people suffering because of his own actions and plans linked to greed. The brutal study of a man and the realisations he has on his presence and how it affects not only himself but those around him in this tight community is effectively captured in this one sequence.The power Leone instills within the Rojos, over that of the Baxter's, might be seen as a systematic tilting of the dirty and dishevelled over that of the elegant and finely-combed; specifically, in terms of not only whom is more powerful within the film but what a Western ought to resemble. Where inhabiting plusher surroundings and more informed looking locales than that of the Rojos is the norm for the Baxter's, it is the Rojo's whom embody the kinds of traits in their dirty, dishevelled living that Leone's Westerns themselves would come to heavily resemble. American romanticism and finely combed set-shot scenes featuring characters, lead or otherwise, just trying to keep the peace with certain cultured characteristics were on the way out; the eventual taking-down of those in the form of a group whom embody these traits by that of the ""Spaghetti"" conventions rather fitting. The film is directed and paced remarkably, a wondrous example of a man writing and directing with a great deal of confidence in his ability to manoeuvre his way around a number of ideas as well as sub-plots, culminating in thoroughly memorable finale.",A Fistful of Dollars

Brief Review -Akira Kurosawa's Japanese Classic transformed into the First Classic Spaghetti Western of the World Cinema. Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo is one of my favourite films from his singular filmography and when i learnt that it was remade as Spaghetti Western, i was desperate to watch it. Because i know all about the storyline, i decided to watch the next two films of Dollars trilogy first. Both the films 'For a Few Dollars More' and 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' blew my mind and introduced me to Spaghetti Western genre. Now all this and much more i have already said in my review of those two films so let's talk about A Fistful Of Dollars. The World keeps taking about Classic 'Dollars Trilogy' and this is where it all started. This is where two legends Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood begun the sensation that ruled the entire 60s decade. This film is outstanding in every sense of western cinema, rather it is way ahead in few fields. The use of background music in this movie is lesson to all filmmakers that how to use nicely scored tone smartly at deserving and required occasions. Clint Eastwood is so kick-a** and musculine guy, man i just I can't use some words which might offend the terms of IMDb reviews. He's Blasting, i said enough. I mean what Mifune did in Yojimbo was never to be matched but Eastwood was so close. Even the villain John Wells looks so bad-a** (if i could use the word). Rest of the cast is tremendously supportive and impressive. Sergio Leone's direction is well versed, well planned and well minded. Thank god he didn't do unnecessary changes to ruin Kurosawa's Great work and this is a lesson for other directors who ruined many great films in adaptions.

66,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A stylistic accomplishment that changed its genre, and movies",8,21 April 2017,"The Western genre changed forever with the release of Sergio Leone's landmark Spaghetti Western ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" but not necessarily for reasons you might think when it comes to a movie deemed a ""classic.""The story is weak, most of the acting bordering on comical and there's no depth to speak of, but the Akira Kurosawa-inspired style of ""A Fistful of Dollars"" makes it entertaining and a rather fascinating watch from a stylistic perspective. Leone did things with a camera that Hollywood hadn't seen before (probably  I admit I wasn't there), an approach that made the Western more entertaining yet more dramatic and tense.Clint Eastwood stars as Joe, or more popularly, ""The Man with No Name,"" in the role that launched the ""Rawhide"" star's film career. When he comes upon the Mexican border town of San Miguel – where you either get rich or get killed – the anonymous gunslinger puts himself at the center of a bloody feud between the Baxters and the Rojos, playing them off of each other for his financial gain. The Man with No Name is essentially the Western's first true anti- hero. That's the primary contribution ""Fistful of Dollars"" makes to the genre – it pushes past the black-and-white cowboy heroes and wanted bandits dynamic. ""Joe"" has one character-revealing moment when he takes pity on a woman named Marisol (Marianne Koch) and her family, who are captives, in a sense, of the Rojo brothers. Otherwise, he's a troublemaker with money on his mind; we just like the guy because he's a badass who is less slimy than the rest of the characters.The script annoyingly drifts between too overt and not explicit enough, but eventually it becomes clear that the only dialogue worth paying attention to is the clever quips, and that it doesn't matter how a point of tension or violence is reached, but how it looks and feels when we get there.Leone isn't at the peak of his powers here by any stretch, which should be obvious given this was his first foray into Western territory and second film ever, but he gets enough right to open the door to a shift in thinking about how these movies are made. ""Fistful"" is an experimental playground for camera angles and various perspective shots. Cinematographers Massimo Dallamano and Federico Larraya play a lot with lighting, incidentally creating Eastwood's trademark squint. You might argue that Leone and crew stumbled upon greatness and that this movie is a combination of stumbles and sure-footed landings.The secret weapon is Ennio Morricone. The composer's score feels familiar to modern audiences, but it's his creativity using raw sounds and singular instruments in striking patterns that ultimately redefined the genre. He brings the tension, mystery and swagger to the film. He even recognizes when silence works better than anything he could write. In so many ways, his music really glues this experiment of a movie together.Movies that rise to the top in spite of their weaknesses by means of style and creativity are extremely rare, and they're usually an indicator of a film that's a game-changer to the art form. ""A Fistful of Dollars"" qualifies. It's a film that is much more important than it is great.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",A Fistful of Dollars

But now that I live in China and can openly buy the entire Man with No Name trilogy for the equivalent of about $1.20, I decided to finally check them out. The first thing that struck me about the original film is how simple it is. Granted, it's 1964 and a western, but due to the massive iconography this character has, I guess I expected a few more badass scenes. As I'm writing this, there is a curious review on the home page of Fistful of Dollars by a reviewer who calls himself dtucker86 who strangely mentions that ""Clint Eastwood was as best known to American audiences for his role as Rowdy Yates in the series Rawhide."" Strange to me because, first of all Clint Eastwood is still alive even today, a full four years after that review was written (and thus really shouldn't be referred to as ""WAS best known""), but I happen to be a member of American audiences and I've never seen or heard of the TV show Rawhide. Of course, that's going to be attributed to my personal lack of familiarity with mid-20th century TV shows. Indeed, I've never seen a single episode of The Sopranos, so my ignorance of past TV shows should come as no surprise.A Fistful of Dollars is a very storied film, directed by Italian film-making giant Sergio Leone, a man who can't speak more than a couple words of English, and filmed in Italy. Eastwood apparently cut out pages of dialogue for his character (pretty unusual, given that he was only really known from one TV show, Rawhide, and was essentially brand-new to major films), which had the immensely important effect of making his character more mysterious. He squints his way through the film, creating a toughness and grittiness that earned him such huge recognition. The movie is very bare bones, no extravagances, and Eastwood's character (who really shouldn't be called The Man With No Name, but rather The Man With Three Names) is not made into a movie superman. He makes mistakes, gets beaten up, and ultimately wins his respect and victory through smarts, not special effects. Eastwood makes an astonishingly charismatic and interesting western figure, which helped this movie to really launch his career. He plays the one independent role between the battling American and Mexican factions, an unattached rebel with no needs or cares other than to provide for himself, which allows us to relate detachedly to the two sides of good and evil without really associating with either of them.

71,ackstasis,"""Aim for the heart, or you'll never stop me.""",7,25 April 2008,"Italian director Sergio Leone has an awesome, distinctive visual style. I've sometimes heard his Spaghetti Westerns described as operatic, and such a description is not as inappropriate as it initially sounds. Many Western directors achieve depth and scope in their pictures through the use of landscapes; the vast, dry countryside stretching out in all directions, the sheer majesty of John Ford's Monument Valley. For Leone, the human face is his canvas and his landscape. He periodically intersperses long-shots with intimate portraits of every characters' face: their sweat-soaked skin, their cautiously-levelled eyes, their mouths twisted into a grimace of suspicion. By the mid-1960s, Italy had produced several Westerns  all low-budget, and none particularly successful  until Sergio Leone moved on from the ""sword and sandal"" historical epics on which he had been working, and decided to make his own Spaghetti Western {so-called because of the large level of Italian participation both before and behind the camera, though filming usually took place in Spain to evoke the American Southwest}.'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' was the first film in what would later be called Leone's ""Dollars trilogy""  the other two entries were 'For a Few Dollars More (1965)' {the one film I haven't yet seen} and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).' All three films famously starred Clint Eastwood as the laconic and morally-ambiguous Man With No Name. What is most fascinating about 'A Fistful of Dollars' is how Leone was able to reconstruct and breathe new life into a distinctly-American genre that had been suffering dwindling popularity in recent years. His approach is almost satirical; every act of violence is tremendously overblown, and, underscored by Ennio Morricone's overwhelming soundtrack, every confrontation is treated with the utmost reverence, as though Leone is consciously mocking the grim sincerity of many of the classic Western filmmakers who preceded him. Every Western director who followed him would owe at least something to the enduring influence of Leone's efforts.In a neglected town in the middle of the stifling desert, two rivals gangs of smugglers are engaged in a bloody tussle for power. Their conflicts have torn apart the lives of the town's innocent civilians except for the coffin-maker, who does a roaring trade. In comes the mysterious Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood), an enigmatic drifter  a master of the ""quick draw""  who immediately causes a stir among the two gangs, promptly joins both sides, and sets about pitting the two powers against each other in a bid to eradicate their authority once and for all. What separates this character from most other Western anti-heroes is his moral ambiguity; we know practically nothing about his past (aside from the tantalising snippet, ""I knew someone like you once and there was no one there to help"") and his motives are consistently vague. In any case, the film is concerned primarily with spectacle and atmosphere, and the story  allegedly ""borrowed"" from Akira Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo (1961)'  is almost negligible; the result of this strange combination of factors is a film that feels oddly insubstantial, but it's a lot of fun while it lasts.",A Fistful of Dollars
72,dee.reid,A worthy start...,8,14 November 2011,"""A Fistful of Dollars"" is widely considered to be the movie that started it all, the rebirth of the western as a legitimate film genre. The man responsible for pioneering the rebirth of the western was not some big Hollywood hot-shot, but a young Italian filmmaker named Sergio Leone.""A Fistful of Dollars"" was Leone's 1964 western ""update"" (or remake) of Japanese master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa's classic ""Yojimbo"" (1961). The so-called ""spaghetti westerns"" that Leone has claimed credit for helping to jump-start as a legitimate sub-genre of an already-well-worn film genre, is also responsible for launching the career of star Clint Eastwood; it seems a shame that he was best-known for the TV show ""Rawhide"" in the United States at the time, and that he had to go to Europe before people would finally start to take notice of his talents.Technique-wise, Leone's use of wide-angle lenses to capture the oppressive desert-scape, the zooming-in close-ups of the actor's faces (a trend I believe you could say was later adopted by Hong Kong and American martial arts films during the '70s), gritty realism, and highly stylized depiction of the violent west won fans and critics over during the early 1960s. These films were also responsible for making extensive use of the talents of Italian composer Ennio Morricone.Little did they know at that time, however, that ""A Fistful of Dollars"" was just the beginning.As I stated before, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" was Leone's update of ""Yojimbo,"" about a lone gunslinger, the iconic ""Man With No Name"" (Eastwood), riding into a Mexican border town that is in the midst of a gang war between rival factions of smugglers. Because the ""Man With No Name"" (who is sometimes referred to as ""Joe"" in this picture) holds no solid allegiances to anyone, he decides to play both the Mexican Rojo gang against the American Baxters, with him in the middle - soliciting his services to the highest bidder.""A Fistful of Dollars"" is brilliant filmmaking from the word ""go."" Eastwood is undoubtedly the western genre's most iconic star, and it was his work on this film, its 1965 sequel ""For a Few Dollars More,"" and the legendary ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1967) that forever cemented his association with the genre - up until Eastwood's Oscar-winning anti-western ""Unforgiven"" in 1992. He pretty much pioneered the role of the lone anti-hero in the western movies; his squint-y eyes, laconic way of speaking, cigar hanging out the side of his mouth, quick draw of the gun - yeah, that's classic Clint.Clint Eastwood has long been one of my favorites of the golden era of Hollywood (he's my favorite actor overall). Incredibly enough, while not so much a fan of Eastwood's western pictures, I've always been partial to his more modern films (like ""Dirty Harry"" in 1971, which is my personal favorite picture of his so far). I'd say that ""Unforgiven"" is my favorite western of all time, followed by ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.""""A Fistful of Dollars"" = A Fistful of Dynamite!8/10",A Fistful of Dollars
73,drqshadow-reviews,Leone and Eastwood's First Rodeo Sets the Stage for the Epic Trilogy to Come,8,5 July 2012,"Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood team up for the first time and the partnership quickly bears fruit in this classic, scene-shaping western. While the plot is lifted almost verbatim from Akira Kurosawa's epic Yojimbo, the real devil is in the details as Leone challenges dozens of overplayed western tropes and instantly changes the genre's personality from a preachy, predictable windbag to a dirty, selfish, no-nonsense killer. Eastwood is outstanding in his first outing as the Man With No Name, (curiously addressed as ""Joe"" in this chapter) bringing so much depth, certainty and silent substance to the role that it's tough to believe he hadn't been playing it for years. Although it's no comparison to the next two films in the trilogy, which really picks up when Lee Van Cleef enters the fray as Eastwood's dust-cloaked playmate, as warm-ups go it's second to none. At roughly half the length of its siblings, it's also much more digestible and straightforward. Whether that's a positive or a negative is entirely up to the viewer.",A Fistful of Dollars
74,Lechuguilla,Nice Town,7,25 November 2017,"It's San Miguel, in Mexico. The town's got two bosses; neither likes the other. Both bosses lord over a clan of bad guys. The town is not moral; it's a town of death. Into this gloom rides Joe the stranger (Clint Eastwood). The stranger may or may not be a good guy. But he's a sharpshooter with a .45 pistol, and he uses it, a lot. He sizes up things in San Miguel and formulates a clever plan. This stranger is smart.Commonly referred to as the first spaghetti western, ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" evokes a new style: a script with grungy, mean characters; minimal dialogue; a hip protagonist vaguely similar to James Bond. Also, sets, costumes, and music are all highly stylized. I like the style.The script is engineered for maximum entertainment. There are action climax sequences about every ten minutes. Sounds of gunshots are heightened. We never learn anything about Eastwood's character, which makes him mysterious, indeed.Outdoor visuals were shot mostly in southern Spain. Cinematography makes use of long camera shots and extreme close-ups. Camera filters are poorly used in day for night shots. Production design is terrific. San Miguel looks pleasantly minimal with its whitewashed adobe dwellings and dirt streets.The look of the film and the script convey a sense of isolation, mystery, and death. There are references to Easter: a crucifixion, resurrection, a last supper. Though I have never been an Eastwood fan, and would have preferred another actor in his role, the multi-national cast perform their parts well.Aside from the casting of Eastwood, my main problem is the blurring of villains. With two evil gangs, it was hard to tell who was who, and which side each character was on. Overall, though, ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" is an entertaining western. I like its 1960s style much better than the stale, stereotypes of pre-1960 westerns. And that mournful, funereal dirge of Morricone's soundtrack adds enormously to the film's emotional tone.",A Fistful of Dollars
75,smatysia,A pioneering Western,8,19 March 2001,"A classic. The first, or one of the first, films to introduce the concept of the Western antihero. Sergio Leone pioneered a lot of things here. The brightness, the oppressive sunlight. The ugly brutality of Western gunfights, that had always been cleaned up in Hollywood. I understand that Leone's occasional framing of the shooter and his victims in the same shot was not allowed at the time in American films. I thought, upon seeing this film years ago, that some characters (Eastwood) spoke in English, and other characters in Italian. Who knows, maybe some spoke Spanish or German. Must make for an interesting acting job. I rarely notice a movie's music, but the original score by Ennio Morricone was so fitting. Probably the best match of film and music up to that time, and only bested by Hugh Montenegro(?) in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". A very good movie. Grade: A",A Fistful of Dollars
76,jimbo-53-186511,"Fans of Eastwood will enjoy this, but it's very much in the shadow of 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly'",6,16 March 2014,"The basic plot of this film follows Clint Eastwood as 'The Man with no name'. He is a lone gunslinger who befriends 2 rival families in the shape of the Baxters and the Rojos. The Man with no name has no real interest in the feud that these families are involved in and is only interested in how much money he can make from each family by playing them off against each other.I watched the Good, the Bad & The Ugly before I saw this film as I didn't realise that it was part of a trilogy until after I'd watched it. That, in some ways, reflects my score of 6 for 'A Fistful of Dollars'. A Fistful of Dollars is by no means a bad film, but it is definitely inferior to the Good, the Bad & The Ugly.Eastwood plays an interesting character where very little is known about him. I liked this as it gave him an air of mystery and made him interesting to watch. Clint Eastwood is excellent as always and gives a real 'scenery chewing' performance. Unfortunately, for me, he was the only interesting character - all the other characters in this film were rather dull in my opinion. I personally felt I wasn't given any reason to care for them. The Good, the Bad & The Ugly had Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef alongside Eastwood - Wallach was Eastwood's sidekick who provided excellent comic relief and Van Cleef was the villain, but he was an interesting villain. A fistful of dollars lacked additional interesting characters and that I think is the big difference between the 2 films.One other aspect to this film that's impossible to ignore is the horrendous dubbing - the dubbing in TGTBATU was a little out of sync, but in this film it was much worse. There is one scene where a little boy delivers about 30 seconds worth of dialogue seemingly without his mouth moving? Some people think that this aspect is part of the charm with these Spaghetti western and I agree to a certain extent, but I feel that if they are going to dub actors they should at least try and make it reasonably credible. The dubbing was so bad in this film that it almost served as a distraction.Ennio Morricone once again provides us with an excellent score which perfectly complements the film. Every single score he has done so far has been fantastic so I'm more than happy to take my hat off to him. There is also a consistently humorous tone running through the film which does make the film enjoyable.It may seem like I'm panning this film but I'll be honest and admit that on the whole I did find the film enjoyable. The problem is that I watched it after watching TGTBATU and after watching that film and then watching this film it's obvious that this is a much weaker film. I would still recommend watching this film (particularly if you're a fan of Eastwood or a fan of westerns). If (like me) you've watched this film after TGTBATU then you may find this film slightly disappointing in comparison.",A Fistful of Dollars
77,Nazi_Fighter_David,'The Man With No Name' rides into town for the first time...,9,28 August 2005,"Sergio Leone shared a rebellious desire to tumble the old values and present the audience with a new, more mystifying piece of storytelling... The violence, the speed of action in his film announced a totally new European style...Leone placed the poncho on Eastwood's shoulders to give his character a veil of mystery... The cigar acted as a sort of pendant to those ice-cold eyes... He creates a quite unique character, with no name, no horse and no money, a cynical bounty hunter whose impassivity is his main attraction, an ultra-cool gunslinger who leaves us impressed by his exceptionally swift draw... He is a mysterious 'gunman with green eyes' who comes from nowhere and returns there, a cult hero (set against a dry and dead landscape) entering a noisy violent world where evil competes with evil...""A Fistful of Dollars"" is distinguished by Sergio Leone's visual gift, and convincing fashion in handling violence, rape and torture... He presents his sadistic killers, invariably unshaven, sweating and bleeding in frequent big close-ups... Both the real and the unreal invincibility of his 'Stranger' are never better illustrated than in the final scene when the trembling Ramon fills the gunfighter's heart with bullets...Leone's very dark brand of humor stands out when Eastwood walks past a coffin-maker: ""Gets three coffins ready"" he orders... The town heavies make fun of him, asking where his old mule is... ""You see, my mule don't like people laughing, gets the crazy idea you're laughing at him!"" All four heavies get their just punishment for such mockery and as Eastwood returns past the old man, he corrects his miscalculations: ""My mistake, four coffins."" The film is strong on passionate emotions, and bloody violence... This aspect is completely foreign to the American tradition based on John Ford concepts of honor, bravery and romantic adventure... Sergio Leone's film deeply influenced the future of the Western in general and the Italian 'spaghetti' Western in particular...",A Fistful of Dollars

79,barnabyrudge,"The original spaghetti western - a neat, tight, highly atmospheric Yojimbo homage.",8,28 July 2005,"A Fistful Of Dollars marked the start of the spaghetti western genre and launched Clint Eastwood's career. Until this film, Eastwood had been a bit player in numerous forgettable potboilers and the star of the modest TV western Rawhide. But his ultra-cool performance in this atmospheric western really sealed his long and lucrative future. The film also marked the emergence of Sergio Leone as a masterful director - the ultimate evidence of his talent coming a few years later with the stunning Once Upon A Time In The West. Here, Leone uses a dazzling array of close-ups and long shots, and fits the terrific Ennio Morricone score around the action, with considerable skill.The simplistic plot is basically a borrowing of the Japanese movie Yojimbo. A tough, stolid, resourceful drifter named Joe (Clint Eastwood) arrives in the border town of San Miguel. He learns that the town is controlled by two feuding families - the Baxters and the Rojos. One one side, John Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy) acts as the town's ineffective and respectless sheriff; on the other side, the Rojos have murdered and bullied their way to mock-aristocratic status under the guidance of the psychopathic Ramon Rojo (Gian Maria Volonte). Aided by a reluctant bartender and a considerably over-worked coffin maker, Joe cunningly plays each side off against each other. For each family he carries out various killings and other such dirty jobs, pocketing increasing amounts of money for his lethal services while showing no loyalty to either party. But his plans come unstuck when he learns that Ramon has taken a girlfriend named Marisol (Marianna Koch) against her will, forcing her to leave her husband and son and forbidding her from seeing them again. That kind of bullying Joe just won't stand for.....Dripping with atmosphere and suspense, A Fistful Of Dollars was a totally new slant on the tired western genre in 1964. The minimalist plot actually becomes a strength rather than a weakness, lending the film an air of enigmatic mystery (reportedly Eastwood, at his own insistence, had his scant dialogue cut further in order to make Joe come across as the archetypal man of mystery). Gian Maria Volonte is excellent as the villain, giving a performance of real menace and cruelty as the despicable Ramon Rojo. And Ennio Morricone's simple but energetic score has since become an iconic piece of western movie music. A Fistful Of Dollars is an important western milestone. Admittedly, it steals its story from elsewhere and is full of far-fetched gunfights, but it oozes style and is so cleverly put together that its influence on subsequent movies is almost beyond measurement.",A Fistful of Dollars
80,MissSimonetta,"A fascinating example of a ""remake""",8,26 October 2020,"Those who defend the infamous 1998 remake of PSYCHO tend to say it is worthwhile only as an experiment. That is, an experiment regarding the nature of remakes, how the exact same script and the exact same shots paired with different acting, mise en scene, color, and other such elements can result in a product with such a different feel. That's what I tend to think about A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, a very close ""remake"" (really, a rip-off) of YOJIMBO. The main difference from PSYCHO '98 is that A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS doesn't make you want to die when watching it.In fact, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS is a solid western elevated by Leone's directorial style and Clint Eastwood's effortless and weary sense of cool. It changes small details from the Japanese original, mainly due to the differences that come with a shift in setting, but keeps faithful to its source (well, faithful enough for YOJIMBO's creators to sue). I still think YOJIMBO is the better movie as certain little nuances in that movie were either cut or just didn't translate well in this version (ex. I think Unosuke is more interesting than his FISTFUL OF DOLLARS counterpart Ramon) and those nuances tended to make the movie more distinctive and interesting. However, FISTFUL is still fantastic and a great example of how the same story can feel quite different under the direction of another cast and crew.",A Fistful of Dollars

Its loosely based on a Japanese movie, but it doesn't translate well here. Eastwood plays a super power human who says he's playing both ends against the middle in a gang war, but he only takes one side in the movie, so that doesn't make any sense. Nothing in the movie makes any sense. There's gunplay, but not as much action as the other spaghetti westerns. The music can only hold your attention for so long. Poor writing, directing, acting, and plot make this one of the all time worst movies. What's really bad, is that the director just followed all the rules for making a movie and a hero. The hero is nothing close to an anti hero. He's merely a composite of all the characters Robert Taylor, Rod Taylor, Charlton Heston, and other forgettable people played before. Nothing new at all! No ground breaking at all. No risk taking. Just mundane business, even for that era. There is one interesting bit about insulting a mule or horse or whatever, but that's because the equine may be the most entertaining and interesting character.",A Fistful of Dollars
84,slokes,"He Doesn't Think It's Nice, You Laughin'",8,19 April 2004,"Pretty impressive table-setter for the Clint Eastwood westerns, not just the two others Sergio Leone directed but the many after, right up to ""Unforgiven."" Clint's Man With No Name (called ""Joe"" by the coffin maker Piripero, though I suspect that's just what Piripero calls every man he doesn't know by name) appears mysteriously in the town of San Miquel and quickly sets himself up by playing two rival criminal families against each other? But to what end? And what's his motivation?The image one takes away from seeing this film at first may be one of brutal grittiness and realism, what with all those nostril-boring close-ups and blood. But it's actually a moral fable, with The Man With No Name being something of an apocalyptic avenging angel, protecting and enriching the meek and humble while laying waste to the cruel and powerful. This became somewhat more evident in later movies, particularly non-Leone westerns Eastwood did like ""Hang 'Em High,"" ""High Plains Drifter,"" and ""Pale Rider."" With almost a divine sense of responsibility, Leone does care about the fate of the secondary characters; this is no exercise in stylized cinematic cynicism, whatever your preconceptions of the spaghetti western might be. It's Sunday School class at Boot Hill, only delivered with such subtlety you hardly notice being preached to.The style of this film is so singular and impressive that it's almost enough to distract one from the glaring plot holes. Of course, fables are famous for not being too factually coherent. So should it bother one that the graveyard distraction Eastwood's character sets up for both families is one that would fall apart if anyone stopped and wondered why those two fellows sitting by the headstone didn't get up and move with all that shooting around them? Or that the Baxters part of the story is resolved with such ridiculous ease? Or that Eastwood's protective precautions at the end make no sense for a number of reasons too obvious to mention? Well, yes, if you are going to call this film a classic. But it's still a great flick.One reason we overlook the flaws is because the film moves so briskly, catching us up in the momentum. We see The Man watch the Rojos ride off, and before their horses' galloping recedes from the soundtrack, he's already climbing up a wall ready to unleash the next phase of his plot. Everything seems to happen so quick, you have no time to think about it, just prepare yourself for what happens next. Good films just didn't move that fast before 1964, and only a rare one does so today.Helping in the enjoyment department is Eastwood's lazy-faced acting style, fast editing, a boom-boom script, and some of the fanciest camerawork you'll ever see in a low budget film. There's one great shot, of a fugitive dragging himself across a dirt road and under the raised boardwalk of a wooden building. As his heels disappear from the shot, we see a group of men burst out of a distant gate and slowly emerge into focus. Ramon, the head of the Rojo clan, is shouting orders, demanding they find this guy, and leaps on the boardwalk brandishing his rifle. Without a single cut in this entire sequence, the camera then pans down and picks up a shot of the fugitive's face, perfectly framed behind a gap in the flooring below Ramon's feet. That there's a perfect marriage of storytelling and technical skill, my friend.Not much else to say, except I don't think we'd be talking so much about this film, good as it is, if it wasn't followed by two better sequels. But it is a fine film on its own terms, a ballet of gunplay and cinematography, offered up with a dollop of saving humor and spiritual grace.",A Fistful of Dollars

86,Witchfinder-General-666,The Brilliant Debut For The Man With No Name,10,10 December 2006,"Sergio Leone's ""Per Un Pugno Di Dollari"" aka. ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" of 1964 could be described as one of the most important movies in the history of motion pictures. The first movie of its kind, it rose the Italian Western to an international level, and if it had not been for ""Per Un Pugno Di Dollari"", the great genre of the Spaghetti Westerns would probably never have become what it is.Based On Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece ""Yojimbo"" of 1961, ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" is not a simple remake, but a masterpiece based on another masterpiece (something very rare in film history) that definitely has its very own style. There is no doubt for me that both Kurosawa and Leone are two of the most important and brilliant directors of all time. I love ""Yojimbo"" as I love ""Per Un Pugno Di Dollari"" and I could not say which one I prefer.The movie that made the Italian Western what it is, made Clint Eastwood a star as an actor and Sergio Leone a star as a director. It also made Ennio Morricone famous, who is arguably the most brilliant film score composer of all time, and it basically created the Western Anti Hero.A cigar smoking stranger, the Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood) comes to San Miguel, a small town in the Mexican/American borderland, which is terrorized by two rival gangs of outlaws, lead by two families, the Baxters and the Rojos. He plays the two families against each other in order to free the town (his secondary reason) and earn a lot of money (his primary reason.Clint Eastwood's performance as the Man With No Name (Joe in the credits) is superb. I can't remember any actor who has achieved the coolness of Clint Eastwood in the Dollar Trilogy, and I don't think any actor Ever will. But Clint Eastwood is not the only one who delivers an outstanding performance in ""A Fistful Of Dollars"". The great Gian Maria Volontè plays the crazy and villainous Ramón Rojo with brilliance, Volontè represents insanity and evilness equally believable and superb as Eastwood represents Coolness.The supporting cast is also great, the beautiful Marianne Koch fits perfectly in the role of Marisol, a young mother who is held captured by Gian Maria Volontè's character Ramón Rojo, who is in love with her. The supporting cast furthermore includes such great Spaghetti Western actors as Mario Brega, Aldo Sambrell and Benito Steffanelli, actors who have gained fame amongst Spaghetti Western fans, for roles such as those in ""A Fistful of Dollars"".It is Ennio Morricone's iconic, brilliant score that gives this movie perfection. Morricone's scores are one of the most essential things about Sergio Leone's films, see ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" and you'll know what I mean.""A Fistfull Of Dollars"" is a superbly directed, violent film about selfishness, greed and hatred, full of black humor and spiced up with great dialogue. A masterpiece that is only excelled by its two successors, ""Per Qualche Dollaro In Più"" aka. ""For A Few Dollars More"" and ""Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo."" aka. ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" (which is my favorite movie of all-time), ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" is one of the movies that, in my opinion, everybody has to see.

87,Steffi_P,"""My mule don't like people laughing""",8,15 October 2006,"For this picture Leone seems to now be in total control. This is his project and his chance to make his mark. And make his mark he did, spawning a wave of Italian made westerns and bringing a realistic level of violence to the genre five years before Peckinpah.It would be a mistake to assume Leone was innovating in a vacuum. Fistful of Dollars is at the same time pioneering and derivative. Of course there is the fact that the plot was around 90% stolen from Kurosawa's Yojimbo, but that has been discussed enough elsewhere. Also on display is a clear devotion to the Eisenstein montage technique, as well as the visual extremeness of directors such as Luis Bunuel and Michael Powell. As for reinventing the western, Leone was for the most part simply drawing together the strings from the grittier US-made westerns that were starting to appear in the 1950s  High Noon, The Searchers, Rio Bravo to name but three. But while those films only tentatively pushed at the rules, Leone outright tramples over them, and its this that makes the film a landmark.For the first time we see Leone trademarks like the extreme close-up (for which, by the way, Leone is as often disregarded as an amateur as he is revered), with grimy faces almost filling the screen in contrast to the landscape. He also shows how he is the master of location atmosphere, with set design, costume, movement and music creating just the right feel for this dead Mexican village. There is some of Leone's intelligent rhythmic cross cutting in a scene in which Clint Eastwood is tapping his pistol butt against barrels searching for one which contains gold, while simultaneously a gun battle is going on elsewhere. It seems strange though on Leone's first use of the Almeria location that there are none of the fabulous landscape shots that were such an integral part to his following westerns.Then there is the music  the beginning of what is in my opinion the greatest director-composer relationship in film history. The incredible level of understanding between Leone and Ennio Morricone was apparent early on, although it wasn't fully developed. Here, as is usual in film-making, the music was composed after filming wrapped whereas in later films Morricone's music would be recorded before a single reel had been shot, and so for Fistful of Dollars he wrote music which underscores the action in quite a traditional way. Leone-Morricone partnership trademarks such as individual themes for each character and the little snatches of music that act like cinematic punctuation were still to come. Morricone himself didn't rate the Fistful of Dollars score very highly. True, it's not among his best but it's not half bad either. Particularly interesting is the slightly eastern melody which occasionally creeps in (for example when the ""Adios Amigo"" man rides past at the beginning), perhaps in reference to the Asian origins of the story.Fistful of Dollars is not without its glaring weaknesses. There are some appalling performances in the minor and extra roles, particularly when it comes to the seemingly simple act of dying. My favourite ""ridiculous death of an extra"" has to be when a Mexican soldier is shot in the back whilst scrambling up a hill. Even as he falls backwards screaming he somehow feels the need to hold onto his hat to stop it falling off his head. On top of that, the plot differences between Fistful of Dollars and Yojimbo aren't all changes for the better, for example the scene in which the dead bodies of two soldiers are used to trick the Baxters and the Rojos into fighting each other. It seems a bit beyond belief that all those men would be taken in by the idea that the two soldiers fleeing for the lives would first stop for a nap in the middle of a cemetery and secondly have a gun battle going on around them and NOT WAKE UP. However, these are just minor gripes and most viewers should be able to laugh them off.So, a defining moment in the careers of a great director and a great actor, as well as the launch pad for a whole new sub-genre of spaghetti westerns. It's cheap and cheerful, it's a little rough at the edges, but its good entertainment, with the brain of a truly talented filmmaker behind it all.",A Fistful of Dollars
88,rbverhoef,The first of the three,9,2 November 2003,"'A Fistful of Dollars' is the first from Sergio Leone's trilogy about ""The Man with No Name"". The other two movies are 'For a Few Dollars More' and the famous 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. Although 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is considered the best this one comes pretty close. It is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo' and it comes also pretty close to that movie. It was also the first real Spaghetti Western.Clint Eastwood is ""The Man with No Name"" who comes to a small town where two families run the place. Both families hate each other and he thinks he can make a lot of money with playing both parties against each other. This is basically the main story. There are some sub-plots, one of them involves Marisol (Marianne Koch) who is taken by a leader of one of the families. Her husband and child still live in the town.For me it was not the story that made this movie interesting. It was the whole atmosphere. I like all Leone's westerns for that reason. Of course some are better than others, but they are never boring. The way we see Eastwood kill four man early in the movie is simply spectacular.This no 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or even 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' but we have the same atmosphere, the same kind of score by Ennio Morricone and a Clint Eastwood at the beginning of a great career.",A Fistful of Dollars
89,valleyjohn,Weakest of the bunch,8,19 December 2008,"When A Fistful Of Dollars, was released in the mid-1960s, the term ""Spaghetti Western"" was coined as a putdown to the new western films that dared to recreate the Wild West in a place as far away as Italy.However the Italian directors had the last laugh as the realistic , gritty look rather than the soppy romantic look of the wild west portrayed in the majority of John Wayne films will always be remembered more fondly.A wandering gunfighter - a man with no name - rides into San Miguel, a desolate border town torn apart by two warring gangs of smugglers, the Baxters and the Rojos. After a deadly run-in with a group of gangsters, the anonymous gunman is soon offered employment by both of the rival gangs. But instead, he concocts a plan to play each side against the other, and make a fortune in the process. Clint Eastwood stars as ""The Man With No Name"" in Sergio Leone's remake of Akira Kurosawa's classic samurai tale- Yojimbo ( a film i will be reviewing in the new year)This film the first in a series of movies by Sergio Leone and although it is seen as an iconic movie it is by far the worst of the series. The dubbing is poor ( every Mexican seems to have the same voice) and the story is not the strongest but is looks fantastic and has a soundtrack that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Clint Eastwood is fantastic . I vaguely remember seeing this as a kid and thinking i wanted to be him . I wanted to have a colt 45 by my side and ride into town looking for trouble! Before A fistfull of Dollars Clint Eastwood was only a minor TV star so this movie projected him into the big time and he hasn't looked back since.There is one scene that i Particularly love. It's when the man with no name confronts the Baxters not long after they shot at his horse. He says to them ""I don't think it's nice, you laughin'. You see, my mule don't like people laughing. He gets the crazy idea you're laughin' at him. Now if you apologize, like I know you're going to, I might convince him that you really didn't mean it.""The look on their faces is of disbelief. They somehow know they are facing someone they shouldn't have messed with and needless to say they soon experience joe's prowess with a six shooter.Thankfully A fistfull of dollars is by far the shortest of Leone's films which makes it a very easy film to watch.I will be reviewing the other films in the series in the new year and i am looking forward to seeing them all again.7 out of 10",A Fistful of Dollars
90,davidmvining,Great Moments,7,1 November 2021,"This is a film of great moments. I'm not entirely convinced that they coalesce into an actually good film, but I'm consistently entertained every time I watch it. And that, really, is all the movie really endeavors for, entertainment. Plagiarizing Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo (to the point where Kurosawa all but owned the film in Japan after his legal challenge) and bringing over the young actor Clint Eastwood, known only for his role in the television show Rawhide, Sergio Leone took the studio cache he had acquired after the direction of The Colossus of Rhodes and made one of the early spaghetti westerns, helping to create and popularize a burgeoning subgenre.An unnamed man on a horse (Clint Eastwood) rides into the remote Mexican town of San Miguel. He is met by a series of sights that go without explanation. A young boy moves from one building to another, crawling in through a window. He's ejected outside by some men with a young woman (Marisol played by Marianne Koch) looking out expressionless from the window in question. The man does and says nothing, instead moving deeper into town. It's a dead place. There's no business, no activity. Instead there are two centers of town on opposite sides of the main street. On the near side are the men of the Baxter clan, shooting at the man's horse's feet, forcing the beast into a high-pitched gallop that leaves the man hanging from the sign of the local tavern. On the other end of town is the large house of the Rojos, and in the middle is Silvantino (Pepe Calvo), the weathered proprietor of the tavern who gives the man the rundown.The argument between the Baxters and the Rojos has crescendoed to the point where the only way for anyone to make money in the town is to join one of the gangs and kill other men. There's no commerce left, and the man has an idea. He'll pit one side against the other, with him in the middle, raking in cash from both. The first step is to kill the Baxter men who insulted him on the way into town. He makes quick work of them in public, and walks right over to the Rojo house and gets paid $100 for his troubles. A bit of eavesdropping of a conversation between Esteban (Sieghardt Rupp) and Miguel (Antonio Prieto) Rojo tells the man that they'll never trust him and will take the first chance to kill him, so he moves out, back to the tavern.The plot itself is rather loose with connective tissue from one sequence to the other often kind of thin, like when hears open talk of the Rojos about a military caravan coming through town in a few days, so the man decides to just go and investigate. There, he witnesses a Mexican army suddenly massacred by the American army, supposedly delivering guns in exchange for gold, but the Americans were simply the men of the third Rojo brother Ramon (Gian Volonte). The man uses the situation to put the two sides in direct conflict with each other, dragging a pair of corpses to the cemetery and spreading word that the men are survivors. When both the Baxters and the Rojos arrive, a gunfight ensues, and a prisoner is taken.The movie really doesn't care that much about this story. It's probably far too complicated (and seemingly a bit incomplete since the man never actually goes to work for the Baxters) for Leone's emergent style. His style requires simplicity in narrative because it's more about the tension of individual moments. A flurry of dialogue explaining motivations from one big moment to the next isn't really conducive to this kind of story. It needs to be a story of simple movements, just enough to justify the next big moment. Needing to explain the history of Marisol's kidnapping by the Rojos, her inability to see her son and her husband, and her desire to get out? The amount of explicit explanation we get in the middle of a tense moment isn't that interesting, undercutting the moment itself. Later Leone would strip this sort of thing down to its minimum, usually helping his movies feel more cohesive.It's really this sort of thing that keeps me from loving A Fistful of Dollars at the same level as many others. The moment of the man discovering this information happens when Marisol and the heir to the Baxters Antonio (Carol Brown) are being exchanged in the middle of town. It's a great little sequence, tense and filled with dread as things could go wrong, and then it breaks to give the man the unnecessary exposition.The movie's plot resolves with violence, fire, close calls, and death. It's a thinly thrilling series of events that leads to a satisfactory conclusion.Ah, but the moments along the way. The man facing off against Ramon in the street while the man hides his plate metal armor, the man's escape from the Rojos, the man's rescue of Marisol from the remote hideaway, these are all great moments where Leone often edited too long in order to fit the music by Ennio Morricone. That overlong nature is far from a bad thing, helping to ratchet up tension while great music plays. I have no problem with this, it's kind of one of the central things that makes Leone's work overall special (and something that was sorely missing from The Colossus of Rhodes), it's just that the story around those moments seems overburdened and a bit underdeveloped at the same time. It feels like Leone and his screenwriter Duccio Tessari started with the objective or remaking Yojimbo, but Leone just kind of fell in love with Clint's coolness along the way, stripping the script down of, in particular, Clint's lines to make him a bit more enigmatic. The result was a movie of great moments that has some stuff in between.I enjoy the film, for sure. It's fun, tense, and exciting, and that's almost entirely driven by Leone's craftsmanship with the camera and in the editing bay (special shout out to Roberto Cinquini, the actual editor, of course), carrying a somewhat incomplete script well past the finish line.",A Fistful of Dollars
91,RatedVforVinny,"A raw, violent score of ten.",10,1 December 2019,"The first of Sergio Leone's epic 'Dollars Trilogy'. A Fistful of Dollars' is a bit rough around the edges but it's still the most groundbreaking Western of all time and aided with a masterpiece of a soundtrack by the Legendary Ennio Morricone. When it was released in the U.S (some years later) it blew every American counterpart off the screen. Subsequently became highly influential in both Europe and States. This new breed from Italy became a chief influence to the rather wonderful Sergio ('Django') Corbucci, and also inspired the violence, introduced by Sam Peckinpah, in a film such as 'The Wild Bunch'. The friendly face of the Western yarn was changed forever! To Eastwoods great credit he helped create his own costume and deliver the sharpest, minimalist dialog. The latter has be imitated countless times (throughout modern cinema history). A fantastic supporting cast and with the ultimate baddie, played by the great Gian Maria Volonte. Ironically got panned by film critics the world over, when it was released in 1964.",A Fistful of Dollars
92,p-stepien,In the shadow of Kurosawa,5,3 October 2011,"Not many will be surprised that ""A Fistful of Dollars"", the first of Sergio Leone's famous trilogy, is in fact a replica (or if you prefer 'a westernisation of the westernised Samurai genre') of Akira Kurosawa's famed Ronin drama ""Yojimbo"" (predating this movie by just a few years). The plot will also not come of any surprise, as multiple movies borrowed inspiration from the original Japanese movie. In a town overrun by thieves, crooks and murderers two families rule the wealth and life of its inhabitants: The Rojos and the Baxters. That is until one day an unnamed stranger (The Man Without a Name), concealed within an eternally memorable poncho, arrives on his horse. Offering his services to both sides in an attempt to dispose both of them...Given how classic ""Yojimbo"" is and its undying relativity to international cinema, it is almost impossible to not draw any comparisons. And those almost without exception favour the Japanese original. ""A Fistful of Dollars"" lacks the artistic coherence that Kurosawa effortlessly instills into his movies, whilst at the same time keeping it funny, intriguing and well paced. Despite Leone's best intentions he fails to outdo ""Yojimbo"" in either of these departments, while the best scenes are almost shot by shot taken out of the Kurosawa original. Meanwhile most script changes or adjustment fail to improve the story. As a stand-alone piece these deficiencies could have been overlooked, but pasting from the master really causes all the flaws to become glaringly obvious. Especially since Kazuo Miyagawa's cinematography vastly overshadows Dallamano's and Larraya's feeble attempts to replicate.The place where deficiencies are most obvious is in the acting department. Whereas Clint Eastwood's personality and scene presence allows him to go toe to toe with the legendary Toshiro Mifune, the rest of the cast fails to perform and gives some exceptionally cardboard characterisations. Whereas in ""Yojimbo"" the est ethical experience was a total package.The sole place where Sergio Leone's movie is a sublime and meaningful improvement is the unforgettable music of Enrio Morricone.",A Fistful of Dollars
93,winner55,Italian Red Harvest,8,25 June 2006,"In the middle '20's, Dashiell Hammett (best known as author of ""The Maltese Falcon"") wrote'Red Harvest"", in which a nameless private eye (also alcoholic, a status shared by many Hammett heroes) is hired to clean up a small town kept in fear by two warring boot-leg mobs.I believe ""Red Harvest"" did make it to film in the '30's, but I haven't been able to track that down and never saw it.In 1961, Akira Kurosawa brought a version of the story to the screen in ""Yojimbo', with Toshiro Mifune playing the nameless hero. Kurosawa and Mifune add an earthiness to the hero lacking in Hammett's tension filled original: Mifune's samurai is always scratching, eating, cringing or sneering. Perhaps this is to make up for the subtraction of the element of alcoholism that was the chief weakness of Hammett's anti-hero. But it also has the effect of rounding out the character so that he becomes human to us in a way Hammett's anti-hero is not.In 1965, an Italian director, not yet credited with completed film, Sergio Leone, was hired to do a typical ""spaghetti western"" of the era. Instead, he remade 'Yojimbo"" (without giving credit to the original, by the way) as ""A Fistful of Dollars"". The failure to credit ""Yojimbo"" as inspiration raises some ethical questions - but it must be noted that Kurosawa himself made no reference to Hammett in the credits to ""Yojimbo""! In any event, ""A Fistful.(...)"" is a young director's film, full of flaws; but it has an undeniable black-humor and is crisply directed, with some striking visuals that seem to come out of nowhere, given the genre context in which the film is made. The nameless hero is played with a particular coolness by Clint Eastwood, which undercuts the earthiness- the scratching and scruffiness - that remains from the Mifune version - Eastwood's anti-hero rarely eats, and never cringes or sneers. The pivotal torture scene from Yojimbo remains, given a peculiar brutality by the addition of a pan of the expressionless faces of the onlooking outlaws. This scene - predicated on Eastwood's unwillingness to give up the young family he has saved, is finally what makes him a hero. Is it enough? Well. if not, he's certainly one stinky of a masochist, taking a beating like that for nothing. In a world as corrupt as that in which our hero finds himself, it is the smaller sacrifices that determine the ethics of a man. Remaining silent is sometimes the boldest statement to make; it was good enough for Kurosawa and Leone; it's good enough for me.e.j. winner",A Fistful of Dollars
94,coltras35,Classic Sergio Leone western,10,12 March 2021,"Clint Eastwood was previously rollin' rollin' getting those doggies rollin' as Rowdy Yates in Rawhide before finally playing the man with No Name ( many actors including Charles Bronson had been considered for the coveted poncho wearing stranger.), and he's perfect in the role, laconic, wry, cunning, and cuts an iconic figure as he juggles between the Rojos and the Baxter's, earning extra dollars on both sides by playing the two rival gangs against each other.
Equaling Clint Eastwood's magnetic performance is the charismatic Gian Maria Volante, who plays the unhinged rifle-toting Ramon Rojo; matter of fact, Clint soon realises that the Rojos are the worst out of the two gangs, and is soon facing them on the street in a tense, spaghetti-style gunfight. A brilliant start to the Dollar trilogy, it's my 2nd favourite one after A few dollars more.

95,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,A Fistful of Greatness.,9,25 October 2016,"A Fistful of Dollars is one of the most influential films in Western-film history; and the one that would help define all Spaghetti Westerns to come after. This film borrowed its plot from Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, like the main character having no name and a subplot involving the rescue of a woman desperate to get back to her husband and son.Sergio Leone made a quantum leap of cinematic history when he made A Fistful of Dollars in the 60s, and the man's legacy would continue through to his later films and even after them he would influence American Westerns in turn. A Fistful of Dollars is a bloody, raw and ruthless type of Western that doesn't shy away from showing graphic violence uncommon in these types of films from the decade. This film shows Clint Eastwood getting beat-up pretty badly that one of his eyes are swollen: and that's only one example of how A Fistful of Dollars separated itself from the American Western market.The music consists of whistling, guitar (electric and traditional) and flutes. The music isn't orchestral like one of John Ford's Westerns: it uses different scoring to make up for a very different atmosphere that's now classic in film culture. The Spaghetti Western brought elements of rock to a genre that seemed out of place, but not it feels so IN place. It's a subversive piece of genius; the music in itself is exactly this.A Fistful of Dollars is brimming with Clint Eastwood's cool-tough-guy presence played alongside European film-making accompanied by one of cinema's great film scores backing up one of the finest Westerns ever put on film.",A Fistful of Dollars
96,Cosmoeticadotcom,Good,7,7 June 2012,"A Fistful Of Dollars, the 1964 film by Sergio Leone, that ignited the Spaghetti Western craze, is a very interesting film, even if it is only a pretty good film, cinematically. Among the interesting things about it is that its English language title, as presented within the film, lacks the article 'A.' It is Fistful Of Dollars, translated from the Italian Per Un Pugno Di Dollari. Another of its interesting facts is that it is perhaps one of the miost successful examples of artistic plagiarism ever, basically being a rework of Akira Kurosawa's 1961 film Yojimbo (Kurosawa sued Leone over the film and reaped substantial financial benefits from an out of court settlement, getting 15% of the film's worldwide gross, and exclusive distribution rights for Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, making more money with this film than with any of his own). And, despite claims of this film's being rooted in other sources, including those that aided Yojimbo, there are simply far too many scenes that are not the same, but virtually identical, down to dialogue and camera angles. No doubt, this film is plagiarism, but, as the saying goes, if you're gonna steal, steal from the best). Naturally, it is an inferior film (less depth, details, nuances, and intricacies), but Leone was simply too good a director to let the film totally flail away in imitation. Another fact is that the film is often said to have been the first part of a trilogy of films called The Man With No Name Trilogy. This is not so, for the whole Man With No Name concept was an American marketing campaign, and not something original to Leone. The trilogy is The Dollars Trilogy, but the character played by Clint Eastwood, in all three films: this, For A Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly, is a) not unnamed (he has three names or nicknames in each film), and b) the films are set in different times and places, so are not likely the same character, merely the same mythic archetype, a sort of Old West Everyman, yet one with the talents and luck of James Bond and an inscrutable mind (unlike the Sanjuro character in Yojimbo, for whom rumination's the thing).Taken on its own, A Fistful Of Dollars is a more influential than great film (all plagiarism aside), and it augured Leone's true mastery of the craft, evidenced in later films, like his two Once Upon A Time films: Once Upon A Time In The West and Once Upon A Time In America, but it is its own influence on its successor films that is the most interesting thing about this film.

Especially riveting are the showdown scenes in which Leone uses multiple extreme close-ups on each character's face and that furious score in the background to create serious tension.

While, in part, he owes a lot to Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, whose film Yojimbo (1961) inspired A Fistful of Dollars, this was in deed a milestone in his career as an actor.For those familiar with Kurosawa's film, the plot is identical. A Fistful of Dollars, you see, was an unauthorized remake of Yojimbo (1961). So resembling are the two films that Kurosawa successfully sued the Italian producers for copyright infringement. The plots are the same. A nameless drifter (Clint Eastwood) wanders into a small town torn apart by corruption and the fact that it's run by two bosses (Gian Maria Volonté and Wolfgang Lukschy). He decides to stick around in a place full of death and plays the two sides against each other, constantly shifting his alliance between them for his own advantage.Even if it is a direct rip-off of Yojimbo (1961), a far superior film, A Fistful of Dollars is still a movie worthy of one's time. I don't think it's great, but it is fun and has a certain level of charm to it. I did feel the screenplay was a patchwork of good and bad writing and that some scenes were flat-out dull, but then there came those moments that were truly great, such as the final confrontation between Eastwood and the bad guys, that redeemed the movie and redeemed Leone for copying Kurosawa's masterpiece, for it was there that he inserted his own ideas. And Eastwood was great as The Man With No Name, although I feel they had not perfected the character yet. There was too muchemotion I guess. But when he starred as the character again in the first sequel, the Italian screenwriters got it right and that was where Eastwood really shined.After A Fistful of Dollars, Eastwood starred in two more Italian Westerns under Leone's guidance. There was For a Few Dollars More in 1965, which I also recommend. And then there came Leone's greatest, and the best Western ever made: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966).So while it's not a great film, A Fistful of Dollars is certainly interesting and worth seeing a couple of times. And certainly a good way to introduce Eastwood's iconic character, The Man with No Name.",A Fistful of Dollars

Their respective legendary status started with this, the first ""spaghetti"" Western A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. Before ""Fistful"", Westerns were all-American, monotonous offerings with a clear delineations between good and evil and and mostly non-expressive, one-note characters. Then comes this film with its international cast, a mysterious no-named drifter, flamboyant villains, dubbed dialogue, an Old 'American' West that looks nothing like the West we were used to seeing: desert vistas, hot all the time, no winters. A skewered re-invention of the genre, indeed. And a fully enjoyable film experience.Eastwood essentially plays a no-name, but is called ""Joe"" by several of the characters. He apparently has no real mission in life other than to lend his gunfighting skills to the highest bidder. ""Joe"" runs into trouble ASAP when he arrives in a Mexican-American border town. He kills 4 gunfighters for striking his mule...the first time we get to see Eastwood's quick-draw skills.The town run on opposite ends by the three Rojo brothers and the Mexican-American Baxter clan, who have been vying for control of it for years. Eastwood plays both ends against the middle showing no loyalty one way or the other. The main Rojo brother is Ramon (played deliciously by Gian Maria Volonte, who went on to also star as the main villain in Leone's spaghetti sequel ""For a Few Dollars More"" with Eastwood) and he has just returned from attacking and stealing an arsenal of weaponry from an Army outfit. Ramon has taken captive Marisol (a vivacious Marianne Koch), a local peasant who has a husband and son. The Baxters are led by Consuela (lusciously played by Margarita Lozano), whose husband and son essentially follow her orders. Rare to see a woman with a dominant role in a testosterone-filled Western. Eastwood also has 2 entertaining sidekicks in this film, the local barowner-innkeeper Silvanito (Jose Calvo), who fills him in on the Rojos and Baxters early in the film, and coffinmaker Piripero (wonderfully played by Joseph Egger), whose facial humor speaks volumes throughout the film.""Joe"" takes Marisol from Ramon and gives her to the Baxters, who try to use her as a bargaining chip to get what they want from Ramon. Then Ramon takes the Baxter son and the two sides must make a trade to get back what their ""loved one"". The exchange scene in the middle of the film is a defining point of all Leone's Westerns: tons of character closeups, operatic background music, minimal dialogue, and an utter sense of doom! Leaves it to the viewer to absorb. Brilliantly done. On the surface, ""Joe"" seems to be all for himself, but upon seeing Marisol's family being torn apart, he saves them and almost gets himself killed for it. Ramon's men beat the hell out of him and only keep him alive to tell where Marisol is. They think he's given her back to the Baxters, so Ramon and his men finish the Baxters off in a scene that can be described as watching someone play a video game! They burn down the Baxters' home and as the helpless victims come out, they gun them down one by one with total glee and amusement. A rather startling scene! In the ensuing chaos, ""Joe"" manages to escape, heal himself, and return to town for revenge. The climactic gun battle is perfection (I'd say it is the best climax of the entire trilogy), as ""Joe"" re-appears as if a spirit returning from the dead, a common theme in a lot of Eastwood Westerns, not just his with Leone, but in his own that he directed.The Leone sequels may both be considered greater films, but I still love this one for its simplicity, originality, intimacy, bravado, subtle humor, re-watchability, and influence.

The Baxters certainly aren't saints but it's the unspeakably evil Rojos who are the really bad guys here. Our hero must deal with them but all in good time. He can use them for his own benefit first. The story lurches from one shootout to the next. The town's coffin maker is doing a very brisk business. As the bodies pile up The Man With No Name stands in the middle. He's not your typical hero who's set out to save the world. But what, if anything other than money, is he ultimately playing at? And how many will die before the mystery man wanders out of town? There really is not very much to the story, it's exceptionally simple. The Man With No Name lights the fuse on the simmering Baxter-Rojo feud and carnage ensues. Eastwood's performance is fantastic, bringing to life this mysterious character. It's hard to judge the other performers as they're mostly left to the mercy of the film's dubbing which ranges from being at times passable to sadly often being laughably terrible. There is also the sense that the Rojos are maybe a little too evil for the film's good, unbelievably cartoonish at times. Listening to them laughing hysterically as they murder innocent, defenseless people in cold blood becomes tough to take after a while. So many shootouts in the film, it does become a tad repetitive. Some of these scenes are undeniably dramatic. Others, notably one scene which takes place in a cemetery, come across as a little silly. Director Sergio Leone has some interesting pieces here but he did not quite manage to put those pieces together into an ultimately satisfying whole. Visually the film looks very good, certainly no quibbles with the work Leone did there. But the film is let down a bit by its story. It has a fascinating character at its heart but not everything which surrounds that one great character works. But there is enough here to intrigue you, to make you wonder where The Man With No Name may go next. Leone created a different kind of Western. Maybe he didn't get it perfectly right the first time out. But this was only the beginning, there would be so much more to come.",A Fistful of Dollars
104,sharky_55,To kill a man you shoot him in the heart.,7,24 January 2016,"The opening credits of Fistful are as flashy and colourful as the film gets; red silhouettes of classic western archetypes, Morricone's whistles, bangs and gunshots...then it becomes a lot more subdued. Leone would later, on the back of the success of this trilogy and its acclaim, be granted with much bigger budgets, but it was here where it all began. The low budget confines the setting to the small town San Miguel, and as Sanjuro, the masterless samurai, walked into town to a hostile reception, so too does the Stranger. But it doesn't really have the same power of the wandering ragged sandals of the rōnin, and the mournful strings that heralded a new coming age make the twisting repeated flute pale in comparison. Eastwood witnesses a domestic struggle that clearly signals bad, and even with his tight lips and elusive persona we know that he is the designated hero. There is nothing wrong with this of course, but for all the fuss about straight up plagiarism and all the legal issues surrounding the two films, Leone does a remarkable job of thinning all the substance from Yojimbo. Even as Eastwood's strut and softly spoken threats cut deep, and are backed up by his astoundingly quick draw, his lines are imitations of the original (""My mistake, four coffins""). While Mifune radiated pure power and skill, with his twitching shoulders and quiet demeanour, Eastwood's lines are short and dry, and we have to be told that he is fast with the trigger and intelligent by the big bad. The scurrying bell ringer is more comedic and less panicked than the constable, deluded in his giggling mania at having lost control of the warring town. The best shot of Fistful is stolen; the lonely figure of Eastwood standing in the middle of town, amidst smoke and ash for his final showdown. But this is a gunfight, and we have already seen him dispatch other men with ease, so it loses the symbolic of sword versus bullet. When Sanjuro dispatches of Unosuke, he uses a hidden knife, and seems to accept the death of the samurai via this dishonourable tactic. In Eastwood's case, he uses a metal plate underneath his clothes, but there is only an ounce of the dramatic quality and finality that Yojimbo conjures. I guess this seems more like praising the former than the latter. As a standard spaghetti western, Fistful is quite good. The characters, apart from one torn apart family, are all violent thugs, or hiding behind the guise of not being one, dirty and grimy and gruff from the everlong plains of the west (although most of these were shot in the rugged landscapes of Spain). The few ones with a bit of sense immediately advise the Stranger to leave town, as if this is the only place left for all of them to exist in their shared villainy. Leone relishes in the close-ups that cut distinctly from each reaction in the final climax, as the key light makes the eyes and sweat gleam, particularly for Volontè's Ramón. He would later perfect this type of cutting in The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.Half of the action however takes place not in the sunbaked landscape but during the night. The trick with the two soldier bodies is impressive enough, but these night-time shoot-outs are incomprehensible in the darkness and lose all tension. The is somewhat compensated by cross-cutting to Eastwood snooping around the Rojo's property as they are absent, in search of gold but instead coming across the girl held hostage. Later, he makes a quiet stand for her husband's life and there is palpable unease in the air as the Rojos stare him down but are hesitant to test his quick draw. There would be a few more of these staredowns in the trilogy, and more importantly with more intensity and gravitas. Fistful, although enjoyable, is undeniably its weakest entry, but provides all the vital building blocks.",A Fistful of Dollars

The camera-work is top-notch,the beautiful panorama of the countryside makes quite an impression,and even though it was filmed in Italy, the landscape easily passes for the American Southwest.

106,Bob-45,The Movie That Forever Changed the Face of the Western,8,7 October 2004,"After nearly 40 years I still remember the moment I decided to see 'A Fistfull of Dollars.' I'd been seeing advertising for the movie in VARIETY for months. However, the only western movies I usually saw were those of John Wayne. Television was producing more interesting characters, such as Paladin ('Have Gun Will Travel') and more realistic settings ('Rawhide). I knew 'Dollars' starred Clint Eastwood, and I didn't relish the thought of spending nearly two hours with the insipid 'Rowdy Yates'. Then I saw the TV commercial. Dreamlike, 'The Man With No Name' walks from the smoke and dust to the strains of an Ennio Morricone score. That settled it. I scrambled to a first-run theater to see 'A Fistfull of Dollars.' I stared breathlessly, transfixed at the surreal credits and the uniquely hypnotic music. The story (based on 'Yojimbo') wasn't great. However, the look and sound of this movie was. This was the first western since the musical 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers' that the characters were unwashed and unshaven. You could practically smell the stench. While 'The Man With No Name' was ruthless, he was also fearless, taking on three guns at once; and he could be sentimental and unselfish, as when he frees Marianne Koch. Eastwood was amazing in this role and is absolutely deserving of all the success he's had because of it. Director Sergio Leone establishes himself as the best visual director since Orson Welles. Ennio Morricone takes western music into an entirely new direction, composing one of the all time great western scores. While Gian Maria Volanté is not as effective here as he was in 'For A Few Dollars More,' he acquits himself well as Ramon, the head villain. Leone's cinematographers pushed the limits of Techniscope farther than anyone else; as a result, all Leone's westerns look great. Likewise, Leone's editors were outstanding.While the weakest of the 'Man With No Name' Trilogy, this is the one that started it all. I give 'Fistfull of Dollars' an '8'.",A Fistful of Dollars
107,gkeith_1,Eastwood still awesome,10,12 October 2013,"Eastwood still awesome. 83 years old, lady friend half his age and both in news this week in National Enquirer online version. He is now an acclaimed director as well as famous actor. He is so good to look at that I have known old women who have since gone to their graves still swooning over Eastwood after watching him on VCR/DVD for decades. Order more coffins, Joe would say (FFD, my abbreviation for this movie).What is it about Eastwood? I would no more watch a western than the man in the moon, but I am studying FFD in film class at university. Once upon a time, I saw him in ""Every Which Way But Loose"", where his bestie is an orangutan. I also saw Clint as ""Pardner"" (a very shy Sylvester Newell) in ""Paint Your Wagon"". In PYW, Clint sings about ""I still see Elisa"", and I truly love it. Eastwood's singing was broadly panned in PYW, but I truly loved it. Now, if he had only tap danced (you read about my tap dance obsession in many of my other 185 reviews!).What is it about FFD?? I study Italy, its language and culture, so that's a help. Joe is single-minded, playing the two families against each other. Joe is steely. He is not interested in female companionship. There is violence, plus the black humor coffin jokes, lol. ""Rawhide"", FFD and other ""American western"" media presentations were typical of 1950s-1960s cowboy-type shows. We had Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, John Wayne, Hopalong Cassidy. Annie Oakley (TV) was made into a cowgirl. Even Howdy Doody wore western garb -- plaid shirt, denim jeans, cowboy boots and neck scarf. Buffalo Bob wore sort-of deerskin fringed outfits-- ala Daniel Boone. What was it about this Cold War fetish with the American western? The Italians wanted to hook up with this phenomenon and get a piece of the action, albeit with tongue-in-cheek black humor. We were still in Post-World War Two America. The U.S. was way less scathed than Europe. Italy was damaged greatly in WWII, but still had a struggling, getting-by film industry. Budgets were still tight, and westerns all'Italiana were done way on the cheap -- a fistful of pennies.I have a B.A. Degree in History, plus have taken lots of Italian and Theatre coursework including movie censorship and critiquing. I have studied acting, voice/singing and fine arts graphic design.",A Fistful of Dollars
108,ivo-cobra8,Sergio Leone's first classic spaghetti western masterpiece and the best one of Clint Eastwood!,10,15 February 2016,"A Fistful of Dollars (1964) in my opinion is the second best one in the spaghetti western series, that is Sergio Leone's first best masterpiece in ""Dollars Trilogy"", that started all. It is my personal favorite western movie of all time. I love this movie to death and I will always cherish it. A lot of people are going for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West and of course Eastwood's Unforgiven as their best favorite western films. But no one talks about this one: A Fistful of Dollars, which in my opinion is a classic & Sergio Leone's first masterpiece! This was the third Clint Eastwood's western film that I saw as a kid and I loved it every since. What can I say? Except I love this movie and it is my second favorite Clint Eastwood western movie. This one is in my top 5 Eastwood western films. I just love this movie to death and I love the story and the actors that it is in this film.This movie is shorter for only an hour and 39 minutes long, which is not boring, it is fast paced and it is filled with classic moments. A Fistful of Dollars is a classic and I can always watch and enjoy it, without been bored. Clint Eastwood stars as the greatest Western character of all time, ever created - ""The Man With No Name"" in the greatest Western of all time. The story is an unofficial reworking of the Akira Kurosawa film Yojimbo from 1961. What I love about this film is Clint Eastwood's character who helps out a young family, who is torn apart from the Rojo's gang, he make sure that the kid goes in to his mom's arms, Eastwood was a heart in this movie. Also you have nice shootouts, Eastwood wears a boiler plate as a bullet proof vest, while Ramón Rojo (Gian Maria Volontè) fires his Winchester '92 rifle at ""The Man With No Name"" brilliant! Than ""The Man With No Name"" kills them all with his colt, excellent! Ramón fires the Mitrailleuse machine gun, killing dozen of Mexican Soldiers, awesome! Gian Maria Volontè as Ramón Rojo was a terrific villain and he did awesome job. The plot start's faster and it is a stone cold classic that started all. Clint Eastwood is the coolest actor in the role playing the famous character of all time, that made him an icon. Every second on screen, he chews up the scenery and even today remains as bad ass as ever. Eastwood's character has been mimicked and copied numerous times over the years and yet he still stands up to modern scrutiny. Despite the character being so cool, there is still humor to be found, like the fact that he ALWAYS has that cigar in his mouth even when he's lying in bed. You also have the classic ""Mule"" scene which manages to be bad ass and funny at the same time. Sergio Leone directs everything to perfection and considering the film is from 1964, it's extremely well paced with plenty of action. The score was provided by Ennio Morricone, who for some reason is credited as Dan Savio. The music is another element that has been copied by practically every other Western since. It set the standard of what a Western could be and once you watch the film, the tune will go through your head for hours. Not only that this movie is a classic but two movies ripped off the story from this film: Bruce Willis's Last Man Standing (1996) which completely ripped off the story from this film and Sukiyaki Western Django (2007).This is the beginning of the Man With No Name series. The visuals are beautiful, the character of the Man With No Name menacing and mysterious, the score is brilliant and the action is a blast. The greatest ""spaghetti"" western ever. The one that launched a thousand copycat versions, even the wonderful score by Ennio Morricone. A Fistful of Dollars is a legendary, with bullets, as loud as the explosions and close ups extreme. The plot is simple (though not as much as the sequel, A Few Dollars More) but that is what enables Sergio to weave a masterpiece. Iconic score. A Fistful of Dollars gets a perfect 10 by me and remains my all time best favorite Eastwood Western movie in the series that I absolutely love to death and I love Clint Eastwood's character. It's a genre that doesn't get enough love and it really should as it deals with all the familiar elements of action films, like this one is.",A Fistful of Dollars
109,itamarscomix,The Man With No Name,8,26 September 2011,"Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is the movie that completely changed the way everyone thought of westerns; and while, in retrospect, it's the weakest and most simplistic of the trilogy, all the stylistic elements are halfway there, and it's the one that put both Eastwood and Leone on the map. For that alone it's worth a respectable place in the history books. It may seem tame compared to more modern westerns but at the time of its release it was darker and grittier than anything else in the genre, and Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name was a completely new kind of anti-hero. On top of that, of course, the last ten minutes are enough to make it a classic.",A Fistful of Dollars

111,charlytully,Back to the Future in a Gran Torino: How the man-with-no-name morphs into Walt Kowalski,9,20 May 2009,"I've spent a good part of my working career in and around the old stomping grounds of GRAN TORINO hero ""Saint Walt"" (Kowalski, as played by Clint Eastwood) in Highland Park (an anomalous island entirely within the city limits of Detroit). Walt, the dying Korean War veteran (owner of the beloved ""mint"" green Pontiac title vehicle of the ""Top 100"" film from 2008) certainly is a direct descendant of Joe, Clint Eastwood's pre-Walt misnomered ""man-with-no-name."" At the beginning of A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, Joe arrives (from who-knows-where) at the dusty bordertown of San Miguel. Though he implies to his eventual two local confidantes that he's only interested in the profit to be made by setting two gangs even more against each other than they were prior to his arrival, Joe apparently gives away ALL the loot he makes to ensure the safety of the family trio he decides to reunite, taking an awful physical beating in consequence. Flash forward 44 movie years (or about 125 historical years), and Kowalski goes Joe one step further, both in the number of gangs confronted (three: Hmong, Hispanic, and black) and in making the ultimate sacrifice to protect the endangered family with which he has no ties, other than proximity. Joe leaves San Miguel bereft of its only significant money-makers, while Walt fades out nearly simultaneously with the ""gangs"" from Chrysler and GM--starting with his beloved Pontiac brand! As a bordertown like San Miguel, Detroit limps on as a shadow of its former self (now ""missing"" 1.2 million of its peak population of 2.1 million), not unlike the Mexican village seemingly depopulated by the time Joe's done with it. The mysterious stranger sees to it that both the Baxter and Rojo compounds burn to the ground, whereas Walt's Detroit features a closed-for-decades 20-story train station that has become the international symbol for urban decay, not to mention dozens of decaying auto factories (starting with the Highland Park building that housed Ford's Model T assembly line) and thousands of half-burned-out houses, outnumbered only by vacant lots, many of which sport a Michigan variety of tumbleweed. Had not a heart attack laid low FISTFUL director Sergio Leone at age 60 two decades ago, he could not have found a more forlorn setting for a post-modern (actually, post-apocalyptic) follow-up to his ""spaghetti western"" trilogy than present-day Detroit. It's fitting that his protégé, TORINO director Eastwood, was able to add two and two together, capturing his mentor's spirit in what may well be one of his own final on-screen roles.",A Fistful of Dollars

Dramatic, well-made, visually brilliant and wonderful dialogs, as my favourite. ""Feel like home"" ""Well I never felt that good at home""Clinty shows off as usual his best as the man-without-a-name and is simply great in the leading role shooting off people and being more selfconfident than any other man. The story is easy. ""Blondie/Joe"", whatever appears in this town where things aren't that nice. Two town bosses, the American Baxters and the Mexican Rojos, Rojos selling liqure and Baxters selling weapons. The thing is that they hate each other, and people keep on getting killed in the city. Rojos on one side and Baxters on the other, Clinty decides to stand between them and starts tricking around, he also get to know the local barowner. Well, so he starts fixing things...A lots of shooting and a lots of classical western on its very best.

115,elvircorhodzic,"""...when a man's got money in his pocket he begins to appreciate peace...""",9,30 July 2017,"A FISTFULL OF DOLLARS is a spaghetti western and an unofficial remake of the Akira Kurosawa film ""Yojimbo"". This film has revived the genre and topics that include a ghostly small town, evil and greedy antagonists and a mysterious anti-hero.A cynical gunfighter comes to a small border town and offers his services to two rivaling gangs. Neither gang is aware of his double play, and each thinks it is using him. A mysterious gunfighter has strange plans and he will outwit them both. However, everything has its price...Mr. Leone has managed to create a special style, which has returned the seriousness in the genre. The tempo is variable, but almost perfect. A stranger appears out of nowhere and quickly adapts to a smuggling game in a small town. It sounds familiar, but again, that is very interesting and exciting. The atmosphere is cold and morbid while the characters are dirty, evil and greedy. Simply, it had to come to the moral redemption at one point. After this turning point in the story, we, finally, can make some sort of distinction between good and evil in this movie.Mr. Leone has skilfully disguised relationships between the protagonists, so it is very difficult to determine interests or emotions in this film. Of course, all those who has watched ""Yojimbo"" will try to connect the dots. A few supporting characters will bring a little humor and empathy in an cruel conflict.Clint Eastwood as the Stranger is ruthless, cruel, and yet realistic and fascinating at the same time. Mr. Leone has set up a trap in his character. How will the audience react to a charming and exciting anti-hero? I guess we all know the truth. Mr. Eastwood has created an iconic character, in which humor bursts through an ice seriousness.The sound effects are superb. I am delighted with the soundtrack. Close-ups, in addition to an unique style, give a tension and severity of a coming conflict. I do not justify an enormous amount of violence in this film, but again, I think that westerns do not need to be a sweet fun for the whole family. This subgenre has brought something new.",A Fistful of Dollars
116,AhmedSpielberg99,Leone at his coolest!,8,20 April 2019,"The final duel is simply one of the tensest final scenes I've ever seen! But aside from it, the shootouts and gun fights are surprisingly boring, monotonous, and unvaried. One the other hand, the action and fight scenes that don't feature guns are so much fun, especially since Leone's style of camerawork and direction here are their best. I'm not exaggerating or anything; but A Fistful of Dollars really has some of the most inventive, and some of the coolest, camerawork and editing scenes I've seen in a Western film.I haven't seen Kurosawa's Yojimbo yet; but I really liked the story of this film. It's a story full of surprises, and twist and turns that kept me quite engaged and engrossed most of the time. While the movie has its slow parts, and the plot doesn't evolve very smoothly; it gets messy and muddled halfway through, A Fistful of Dollars's story never loses its track. The movie also feels somewhat heavy-handed at times, largely because the dialogue gets clumsy and overly expository at moments.I could have never imagined any actor who can be perfectly fit for this role as Clint Eastwood. He is as charismatic, bad-ass and tough as ever as the central character, Joe, and this was quite important, since this movie has this kind of story that focuses primarily on one protagonist (this is my favorite kind, btw).Overall, Per un pugno di dollari is yet another great Leone Western that makes me excited to keep exploring his small but very solid filmography.(8/10)",A Fistful of Dollars

120,alice liddell,Life-changing?,9,23 June 2000,"Much as we may regret admitting it, few films really change our lives.  Some many change the way we think or enrich our means of looking at the world, but if we're honest, they more likely only confirm what we intuit.  Everyone has one film, caught accidentally perhaps, which opens out the Damascean road to that exquisite fantasy world, Cinema.  But that's about it.  So A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS didn't change my life.  I'd probably still be the same person if I'd never seen it.  But caught at a impressionable age, it deranged my senses, it hurtled me into a genre I'd previously held in ignorant contempt, it coloured my dreams, it raised the stakes.  Seeing DOLLARS, I could never again accept the second-rate; it brought me to a pitch of demented excess, a rarefied realm populated by a few, such as the Archers, Minnelli, Preston Sturges.In hindsight, I can admit that DOLLARS is only a foretaste for the greater riches of Leone's subsequent great masterpieces.  While its relatively small scale does not constrain Leone - indeed he blows his limits with a dynamite cheroot - he seemed even more visionary in expansive airs.  But what a foretaste.  Its sensual firebombing easily transcends its tasteful source, YOJIMBO, and it is as excellently constructed as all his best films, which are not the sprawling messes they are often credited as, indeed cannot be if they are to have their desired effect.It is fashionable to see Leone as an abstract artist, a Melville of the Western, and there is much here to bear this out.  DOLLARS opens with a haunting animated shadowshow, stripping the tenets of the genre - landscape, history, the powerful white man - to its mythical bones.  The genius first sequence features a triangle - Joe drinking water, the crying child and father on one side, the helpless mother and the thugs on the other.  This triangular composition is mirrored by the shape of the well where Joe drinks, turning physical action into sheer abstraction.  This triangular shape runs throughout the film (eg Joe, the Rojos and the Baxters), as it does throughout the trilogy as a whole, infecting even the title of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, and provides a cool, ironic counterpoint to the excessive passions, the burning colours, the sun-parched landscape, the bibulous action.This abstraction is often conferred on Joe himself, who is less a human being, than perhaps an allegorical figure, Death, for instance, America, capitalism, a ghost.  The film is one of the most subversive popular films ever made, and to be so, it must, as an action film, undermine its hero.  In many ways he is the typical Hollywood hero, though far cooler - we share his point of view, his sense of strangeness in this unknown town, his powerful gaze which dominates and analyses the chaotic action, accomadates women.But what does he achieve?  His power, his 'wholeness' is purely destructive, he destroys a whole town except for three old men, expelling the only force of fertility, the family.  He has no sexual succour himself, and all the money he makes can never be of use to him beyond amenities.  His great scene in the coffin, witnessing the awesome siege sequence, allies him with death (or perhaps resurrection?), but he gives life to the family.  His naked, amoral capitalism, especially in the era of the Vietnam suggests a critique of America, using the Western, that most American receptacle of dreams.  The Marxist analyses of profit, exploitation and theft in the opening twenty minutes supports this.But to see Joe as an abstraction (which is why we prefer to call him The Man With No Name, even though 'Joe' is the American equivalent of calling a German 'Jerry') denies the body, and in the brutal, Anthony Mann-like torture scene, Joe's body is the site of all his vulnerability and potential failure, not to mention mortality.  Both his and Ramon's gun power is almost parodically phallicised, but without it, he is  mere pulp for beating.  This tension between his supernatural gunplay (hinted at by the score) and his very human frailty is compelling.  We get brief mentions about Joe's own past, in this film full of other's histories, perhaps his failure to protect a woman.  Why this should turn him into a money machine is unclear.  His isolation is certainly contrasted with different examples of the family, all to some degree deeply flawed - the first scene is an astonishing and brutal attack on the family, as two thugs attack the weak-willed father (a mirror of Joe's own failure?).Leone's films are often called operatic, and like most cliches, this one's true.  The circular, ritual nature of the plot, the relentless explosion of irrational emotion and exciting violence, the inexorable music, the overheated religious imagery, the intense Leone close-ups, the flaming colour, all bring the viewer to a heady pitch.  But we must not forget Leone's leftist sympathies, and his films are the nearest the popular cinema has gotten to Brechtian epic theatre, in which conventional ideological narrative (e.g. white American sorts out oleaginous Italians; the broken warrior's retreat to the cave) is continually broken by Leone's alienating style, pushing the boundaries of absurdity (though always full of gorgeous compositions and a mathematician's feel for space), Morricone's awesome music, mocking, excessive, signalling our emotions too broadly, taking us out of the action, amused but disengaged.  Clint was never better than as The Man With No Name, handsome, funny, cruel, sexually ambiguous.  DOLLARS works best as a European ghost story, full of mysterious strangers, gallows, corpses on horseback, widows, coffinmakers, cemetaries, nocturnal orgies, dead defenders of graves etc., reminding us of a Europe itself not uncontaminated from a brutal, pointless, nihilistic, bloody history.",A Fistful of Dollars
121,gigan-92,"""Get three coffins ready.""",10,1 February 2012,"A+ The first in the famed Man with No Name trilogy, this one is a real treat. Clint Eastwood plays a one-of-a-kind anti-hero.

The Italian actors all do very well, my favorite being Margarita Lozano. There are many familiar faces, with Gian Maria Volonté starring. As you know he would go on to play one of my favorite villains of all time in the next film, El Indio. Mario Brega, the butcher turned actor, also stars, and its funny that in all three movies he ends up biting the big one.The cinematography is pretty awesome, and director Sergio Leone definitely knows how to shoot a Western. I hear critics initially called the film a blasphemy for portraying an ""unromantic"" west. Of course now-a-days most of them have admitted their mistakes and acknowledged the film as the masterpiece it is. I love the rugged look of everything. It really sets the tone for the movie.Another aspect I have to comment on is the score. I saw ""For a Few Dollars More"" years before I saw this film, back in the 90s and when I watched this one I actually thought the composer was Dan Savio. I was surprised to learn that this was actually Morricone's stage name. Akin to Luis Bacalov, Ennio Morricone delivers a thrilling and unique brand of music for this Spaghetti Western. . And let us not forget, this was a 1964 film, and should be regarded as the genesis of the genre in itself.The only way I can sum up this film is by simply saying a BAD-ASS movie.",A Fistful of Dollars

124,Peach-2,Atmospheric and quietly astonishing.,9,6 December 1998,A Fistful of Dollars is a great example of style. Sergio Leone is one of the great stylist of modern cinema. Although most people I know seem to remember this as the first time they really paid attention to Clint Eastwood. I will always remember the look of this movie even more. A true movie buff has to appreciate the pacing and atmosphere that Leone creates. Highly recommended.,A Fistful of Dollars
125,dr_foreman,The beginnings of something great...,8,12 August 2006,"""Fistful of Dollars"" is the first and crudest of Sergio Leone's famed spaghetti western trilogy, featuring Clint Eastwood as the slow-talking', fast-shooting, oft-squinting Man with No Name.In many respects it's the weakest film of the bunch, with its occasionally grainy photography, choppy editing and lousy dubbing. On the other hand, it's got a raw energy and freshness that appeals to me. Unlike Leone's other films, it's heavy on action, and is relatively fast-paced. It also feels like something really groundbreaking and new (style-wise, anyway - the plot is apparently copied from ""Yojimbo""). The subsequent films in the series simply duplicate and refine this one's formula.I enjoy seeing Eastwood in the spotlight, all by himself. There's no Lee Van Cleef or Eli Wallach here to hog his screen time. He effortlessly dominates the movie as the sole protagonist, with his supercool persona and dry wit. And his character isn't purely a mercenary; the sequence when he helps Marisol establishes him as a sympathetic ""good guy,"" albeit an unconventional one.Equally impressive is Gian Maria Volontè as Ramon, the central villain. Volontè's performance is wonderfully over-the-top, and he has a very intense look that befits the character and lends him a real sense of menace. Leone and the screenwriters do an excellent job building up Ramon as a formidable opponent, making him do increasingly insane and savage things until the audience is bursting to see Eastwood take him down a peg.Looking back at this now, it's easy to see that Leone inspired a whole slew of later directors, including John Carpenter and, most notably, Quentin Tarantino. On the surface, Leone and Tarantino are birds of a feather because they both explore themes of violence and, occasionally, outright sadism. However, in Leone's films the truly sadistic acts are committed exclusively by the villains, and typically there's a few gentle or sentimental moments sprinkled in the narrative. In Tarantino's case, the so-called heroes are often sadists, and there's no sentiment whatsoever. I prefer Leone.Back to the movie, then...as I was saying, it's definitely a little raw, and rough around the edges perhaps, but it's a blast to watch and funny as hell, in a morbid way. You can sense that Leone and composer Ennio Morricone were poised to explode in a really big way, given more time, more money and perhaps more gumption than they had during the making of this film. But, despite its flaws, this is still great and it stands up quite well on its own, without comparisons to the rest of the trilogy. Certainly, if you're a fan of the Man with No Name, this is arguably his finest hour - the best moment in the spotlight for one of the coolest heroes in movie history.",A Fistful of Dollars

127,braddugg,It's a film that began the great march of the sphagetti western cowboy films with a distinct style.,8,20 September 2014,"It's a film that began the great march of the sphagetti western cowboy films with a distinct style.This film is not so great in itself when compared to other films of the same director Sergio Leone and even the actor Clint Eastwood. But it's instrumental in starting up the legacy of the Western films in a way that was not seen before. The cinemascope view, the stylish and less speaking man with No Name. The precise editing and the landscapes mostly set in New Mexico state or there about in America. The soundtrack that is signature guitar and has some strings and chorus of Ennio Morricone and brought him to Hollywood.This film was made prior to the great film ""The Good The Bad and The Ugly"" and this film is great in it's own right. There were Westerns being made before this film too, but this set a precedent in style which was to inspire many film makers later and still continues to inspire. The format of the film as I have read in references follows Akira Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"". Perhaps, the format was already present but Clint Eastwood certainly took this film to another level. There is lot of curiosity he generated whenever he had the hands on his gun, when he lit a cigar, when he rode the horse. clint Eastwood began a style that shall be there forever in cinema. The walk, the look, the minimal dialogue speaks a lot for itself. I loved the music of Ennio Morricone which is a big part of Sergio Leones films and this soundtrack is supreme. This film is only around 100 minutes and I suppose is the shortest of all other Sergio Leone Western films. So the editing is terrific too. A 4/5 for this great Western.",A Fistful of Dollars

They're rated real high so I feel I need to give them a shot. Nothing really blew my mind about it. One guy comes into a new town and pits two rivaling gangs against each other. Not a bad plot. It never quite drew me in though. I can look back the silly deaths as that's a staple of westerns (the way they fall). That said some stuff like putting two dead guys by a gravestone and telling both sides that they are hiding out in a cemetery shouldn't work. A lot of things in this shouldn't work. Eastwood was pretty cool though. I'm giving this a negative review but I will say it is one of the best westerns I've seen.,A Fistful of Dollars

131,willcundallreview,A Western classic,8,7 May 2014,"Rating-8/10A Fistful of Dollars is a western classic and one that helped cement the westerns of the 50's and 60's in the memories of fans and new audiences alike. With a smartly written, acted and directed story you can't help but watch this and enjoy it and take in the sights of this wonderfully set movie. I enjoyed all of it and for those who enjoy westerns I couldn't recommend this more as a piece. I felt it was a an Excellent and Great film and below is why I felt that about it, and so many other people did too.The story as I say is smart and well thought out, and with some great characters and parallel families, it just makes for one big and fun western, oh and with some bloody violence too. I guess to say this is fun is the wrong word and although it is hugely enjoyable the story is dark and makes for drama at some points, but then goes into some good old gun shoot outs(including the old extremely loud gunshots we got in classic western films). Finally we get a character who guides us through a slow plot but he does it so well it seems even faster.Clint Eastwood in the main role without a name is superb and his menacing voice coupled with his great performance makes for an interesting acting role indeed. I loved the supporting cast and even though no one stands out anywhere near Eastwood, they still do a great job and do what all supporting casts should do even today in film. Finally on the acting it is strong, for some films like this they don't all do well but in this you feel everyone does what there meant to do all the way through.Director Sergio Leone does his job here every well and if it wasn't for the other films in the Man With No Name series then this would be his finest by far. He also had a hand in writing this as well and with a massive writing team we got a great script that when put together with the film is just superb. I liked the chase scenes, gun scenes and anything in the beautiful landscape and for when this was made the quality of the stunts and deaths are great and they don't seem cheesy at all which can happen so often in films of this era.I felt criticism wise that although it warrants very very little, the story could be seen as over dramatic and too much cheesy lines and violence that doesn't fit in with the more quiet scenes. I don't feel they affected it and weren't cheesy etc but that is what could be said about the film. As I have said before I think you have to form your own opinion if you like it or not as I couldn't really find much to criticise this about really.I would Recommend this to those who enjoy a good western film or those who like a good bit of action but it also being drama and tense moments where a shoot-out could happen any second. I believe many will enjoy this as the story is thick with smartly written lines and I said about the tense shoot-outs, well they are every tense and in a sense you could describe this film as a thriller film because sometimes your heart can beat faster when the more quiet stand off's are around.Overall I give it a 8/10 and it is a Great and Excellent film and a firm one of that. I think some will like this film even more than I do, where as some I believe will dislike it, but the only way to find out is to watch it, because the film is classic cinema using one of if not the most famous western star of all time in Clint Eastwood. Finally I will say this is a must for all cinema lovers as it is truly a cinema classic and to say this is in the series that includes ""The Good The Bad And The Ugly"" it really is a great series of films, just excellent.",A Fistful of Dollars

Our hero, ""Joe"" (Clint Eastwood) soon realizes that the only way to get anywhere in that town is to get rich or to kill. So he plays the 2 families against each other. But he keeps his eyes on a woman who hangs around the Rojos, Marisol (Marianne Koch). Ramon Rojo (Gian Maria Volontè), our antagonist, is always suspicious of Joe and for good reason.I really enjoyed the way Clint Eastwood used everyone and managed to keep his own without saying much. Joe is one of the coolest, laid back types I have seen especially in a Western.The movie seems like a westernized version of the Hatfield-McCoy feud, except much bigger and worse. And not as direct fighting either, which stupid hard-on action fans of modern days will not appreciate.Sergio Leone is a great director, and this movie is proof.9/10",A Fistful of Dollars
133,diac228,The Western that spun the genre in another direction,8,25 May 2009,"Stagecoach pretty much set the stage for a very popular genre during the mid-20th century. The western genre is one full of beautiful scenery, exciting adventure, lovable characters, and a clear-cut view on who is good and who is bad. With stars like John Wayne at the helm, for decades we received plenty of tales of cowboys against Indians, sheriffs against bankrobbers, and Manifest Destiny versus Obstacles. But for every genre or trend, there's an anti-genre that comes around and breaks all the rules the original genre established. Clint Eastwood's infamously classic flick A Fistful of Dollars changes all the rules and begins a new trend of western: cynical, hostile, tense, and full of surprises.The Italians had a totally different view about the American wild west. Sergio Leone's tale of double-double crossing is directly influenced by a Japanese samurai epic known as Yojimbo (Enough of an influence to actually cause a lawsuit). In this shoot-em-up western, The Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood) decides to profit off of both sides of a gang war in a violence-driven town by working for both sides. At first his earnings are huge as he tricks both sides but as time moves on, complications arise, suspicions are drawn, and trouble starts brewing.The Wild West of the mid-1800s was anything but clear. A lot of distortion between right and wrong and good and evil occurred, and this was one of the first westerns to reveal this. That's what drives A Fistful of Dollars; the questionable characters, questionable decisions, and sometimes downright cruel implications. Eastwood's character is the supposed hero, but he's no better than the men he is fighting. The story carries this film (technically written by Akira Kurosawa, har har har) to previously uncharted territory. Then the directing is what flings this western into new heights.Leone perfected the close-up shot. Whether it's to reveal emotion, to hide a surprise, or to raise tension, close-ups are scattered throughout the film, and almost always used effectively. The scenes move very slowly, almost to a halt. There can be elongated sequences of people staring at people. While it sounds pointless and boring, these scenes are done extensive amount of times to make the audience feel uneasy and unprepared for what's going to happen next. Most westerns past and present fail to deliver as much tension and suspense as Leone did, which is what separates his gritty westerns from the simple ones of McQueen, Wayne, and other American western stars. To put it simply, Sergio Leone is a major reason why this film entertains.Eastwood himself becomes an icon with his breakthrough role here. Delivering the role with earnest grittiness, few words, and sheer intimidation; he crafted the modern-day bad ass gunslinger. Sometimes to get someone's attention, its best to have your actions do all the talking, and Eastwood proves this. Then let's not forget Ennio Morricone's musical score. Easily one of the most underrated composers in the history of film-making, Morricone mixes simple melodies and songs with musical interludes that carry the viewer through certain scenes. His music will play in your head long after the film is over.Bottom Line: While not the best western of them all, A Fistful of Dollars did indeed break all the rules towards how to make a gritty Western. Ever since there have been imitators (sometimes overdoing it; see: The Wild Bunch) but none can ever match Leone's craft in directing and telling a story. The Leone/Eastwood/Morricone 1-2-3 punch is the deadliest in western film-making, and that's why after all these years, the Fistful of Dollars trilogy stands proud and remains just as popular.",A Fistful of Dollars
134,PudgyPandaMan,Turned the Western genre upside down,7,26 July 2008,"This is the first of the ""Man with No Name"" trilogy's made by Italian director Sergio Leonne. It has a dark cynical storyline which blurs the lines of good and evil. It is by no means the best of the trilogy, but it is still a classic for numerous reasons. Some of the more noteworthy characteristics of this film (good or bad, depending on your tastes):1)There is the unforgettable opening score composed by Ennio Morricone. It has a great texture of sounds including whistling, horse hoof beats, church bell ringing, and gunshots that make it very memorable. The rest of the picture is also punctuated with similar haunting melodies, especially when using the Mexican-sounding trumpet.2)It gives us that first glimpse at what becomes the quintessential Clint persona - the squint, the cigar stub, the hat, the poncho and the days old razor stubble 3)It is quite revolutionary in the increased gore and violence depicted. Although still quite tame by today's standards, it was quite shocking for the mid-60's. This effectively led to the end of the glossy, Hollywood-ized Westerns and replaced it with a grittier, dirtier realism. Perhaps the darkest example of the cold-hearted violence is the shooting of a mother in cold blood. I found the blood to look extremely fake and unbelievable, so it was hard to buy into any real violence.4)Leone utilizes extreme close-ups to great effect and introduces the subjective-point-of-view camera angle. For example, he shows the gunfight from Eastwood's viewpoint, like you are looking over his shoulder.5)There is a great closing sequence. Eastwood emerges form the smoke to teach the bad guys their lesson - talk about an entrance! The trumpet music in the background reaches a crescendo. This is great shot composure for setting up the final conflict.But the film is not without its flaws. There is horrible voice dubbing, very choppy editing, and the lack of continuity (Clints horse repeatedly changes colors, his beard length changes within the same scene, etc.). There is also poor acting by the most all the actors. It is obviously very low budget, although they overcome a lot with the outdoor filming since the landscape scenery is very appropriate.By no means a masterpiece, there is still a lot to like. It is especially useful for setting up the next 2 films in the trilogy, which are admittedly much better.",A Fistful of Dollars
135,jonathan-577,warming up,7,8 December 2007,"Clint Eastwood rides into town to make some money, faces moral dilemma, gets beat up, comes back. This is Sergio and Clint's warmup. It's not as sprawlingly weird and wonderful as the films that followed, Ennio's soundtrack isn't as memorable, and it lacks the operatic grandeur that is this cycle's signature selling point. But that's not to say that there's anything wrong with it, or that it's not enjoyable to watch, or that there aren't some beautifully executed set pieces. It's just to say that this is a high-grade spaghetti western, not a masterstroke of populist cinema art.

An Excellent,Thrilling And Stylish Classic From Sergio Leone And Clint Eastwood.",10,22 October 2014,"A Fistful Of Dollars is one of the greatest Westerns ever made,an excellent,thrilling and stylish classic that combines amazing direction,a terrific star making performance by Clint Eastwood,intense Action and a fantastic score. All of those elements make A Fistful Of Dollars a wonderful movie that is Sergio Leone,Clint Eastwood and the Western genre at it's best.A Fistful Of Dollars tells the story of a gunslinger(Clint Eastwood) who has arrived in a town where there is a feud going on between rival families The Rojos and The Baxters and sees an opportunity to play both sides against each other and make some money. But as the feud between the two families becomes more intense it builds up to violent showdowns with the gunslinger right smack in the middle.A Fistful Of Dollars is a brilliant and unforgettable Western movie that not only was the first film in Sergio Leone's outstanding Man With No Name/Dollars Trilogy but was also the film that made Clint Eastwood a movie star and helped make Eastwood a movie and Western icon and gave movie goers a different kind of Western that is iconic and changed the genre forever and paved the way for the popular sub genre known as the Spaghetti Western. A Fistful Of Dollars is a movie that is an instant classic from the moment you watch it and is a film that is thrilling and stylish,violent and intense as well as brutal and harsh with a power and energy that never stops until the very end. Everything in the movie whether it's the gunfights,characters,music or style is done in a big and operatic way like a huge epic that felt fresh and new. This movie would define the Sergio Leone style that would grow with each of his films. While FOD has tons of style there is still a lot of substance and story dealing with the on going conflicts between the rival families and The Man With No Name being right in the middle and with the conflict there is danger all around. Many have said that A Fistful Of Dollars is a remake of Akira Kurosawa'a classic Yojimbo and I disagree because while FOD share some similarities with Yujimbo Leone puts his own stamp on the film and makes the movie stand out. While the Western genre was still doing well before the release of FOD(thanks to various movies and TV shows)but every Western movie and television showed the West as a clean and pretty place but the West in A Fistful Of Dollars and it's masterful follow-ups For A Few Dollars More and The Good,The Bad And The Ugly is not clean or pretty but dirty and gritty the way the West really was. The whole Man With No Name Trilogy not only revolutionized the Western genre it reinvented it. The Man With No Name(although his name is Joe in the film)is one cinema's greatest movie characters and one of the most iconic anti-heroes that redefined the movie Cowboy. Before the Man With No Name came along Western Cowboys were identified by being good or bad with white hats and black hats but when the Man With No Name was introduced he was a new Western hero that was a combination of good and bad as well as the white hat and black hat with a gray area and moral ambiguity. Also,The Man With No Name is a character that has a scruffy beard,wears a great looking poncho,smokes cigars and is fast with the gun hitting anyone he shoots at and when he shoots someone they go down. While The Man With No Name is tough and cynical he does good things for people which makes him very complex and fascinating. The Man With No Name is a classic character you will never forget. The Action in FOD is sensational and intense with most of the Action being Western gunfights but each of the gunfights are done wonderfully with suspense and tension and when the tension stops the gunfights explodes like dynamite. The Western gunfights in this film The ending in A Fistful Of Dollars is amazing,Action-packed and one of the best endings in a Western film and is one of the things that makes this movie a classic. A Fantastic ending.The cast is great. Clint Eastwood is excellent and at his best as The Man With No Name(or Joe),with Eastwood being charismatic,iconic and cool. Gian Maria Volonte is terrific and memorable as Ramon Rojos,one of the leaders of the Rojo family. Jose Calvo is good and funny as Salvinto,a bartender that befriends Joe. Marianne Koch is beautiful as Marisol,a woman held captive by Ramon. Sieghardt Rupp(Estaban Rojo),Antonio Prieto(Don Miguel Rojo),Wolfgang Lukschy(John Baxter),Margrita Lozano(Consuelo Baxter),Bruno Carotenuto(Antonio Baxter),Joseph Egger(Piripero-The Undertaker)and Mario Brega(Chico)give good performances as well.The direction by Sergio Leone is outstanding and stylish with Leone using close-ups,zooms and great angles giving the movie the right tone. Terrific direction,Leone.The score by Ennio Morricone is terrific,intense,epic and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Great score,Morricone.In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Clint Eastwood,Westerns or films in general,I highly suggest you see A Fistful Of Dollars,One Of the greatest Westerns ever made and an excellent unforgettable classic you will never forget.

It's definitely a slow starter but offers some interesting scenes in the middle and an epic showdown in the end.The film is an unauthorized remake of Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"", from which Leone borrows not only the plot, but a lot of traits that we would find in his later works: the moral ambiguity of the characters, the mysterious antihero without a name, the cynical tone and black humor, the dirty streets, etc. And here is how a Japanese director managed to indirectly renew westerns through an Italian director.",A Fistful of Dollars
138,Eternality,"A Fistful of Dollars is a B-grade ""spaghetti Western"" that entertains and is quite admired by many.",8,27 November 2010,"Sergio Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy begins with A Fistful of Dollars, an admirable attempt at reinventing a genre – the Western – that John Ford had mostly made his own from the thirties to the fifties. It is shot in Italy and the dialogue is in Italian. However, it is difficult to find an original video in its native language track. The dubbing in English is average but it will not be taken into consideration in my assessment of the film.A Fistful of Dollars stars the legendary Clint Eastwood who plays the iconic ""man with no name"". Here, he takes on the name of ""Joe"" after wandering into a town on a barren, desolate land. In this town, there are two warring families driven by greed, lust, and power. Their method of communication is through violence; this has wrecked the entire town resulting in its few inhabitants leading their lives in constant fear.Joe, the unwavering gunfighter, decides to pit the two families against each other through a series of cat-and-mouse games in an attempt to wipe all of them out and free the town. His plan works and backfires at the same time, making it interesting to observe how the situation would play out. Of course, if you have seen Kurosawa's Yojimbo (1961) in which Leone's film is based upon, then you would have an idea what to expect.A Fistful of Dollars is Leone's second feature but his first collaboration with composer Ennio Morricone, whose music would play a huge role in the success of Leone's future films, reaching its zenith with the epic, operatic Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). Here, Morricone's raw sounds complement the stark cinematography and rough editing, giving the film a kind of gritty cover over its amateurish character interplay characterized by dead one-liners that are occasionally unintentionally funny.The final action set-piece raises the tension a notch higher. Complete with wind, dust, and in sweltering heat, Leone sets Joe against the chief villain in a dawn shootout that is expertly staged and precisely executed. It is this climatic sequence that gives viewers the best glimpse of Leone's filmmaking talent and his unmatched sense of timing.A Fistful of Dollars is a B-grade ""spaghetti Western"" that entertains and is quite admired by many. Leone tried to replicate it with For a Few Dollars More (1965) but, in my opinion, to a far less successful outcome. However, in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), he finally scored big time with a film as legendary as they come.SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",A Fistful of Dollars

For cinematic historians these films are worth watching. This pioneered a new style of western and changed the backdrop of movie making forever.

Although the U.S. advertising campaign billed Eastwood's character as ""The Man With No Name,"" a name is one thing he does have - Joe - but almost everything else about him is a mystery except for his deadly proficiency with a gun. Leone's style would be more pronounced in later films, but this one provided the template.

141,refresh_daemon,A Stylish Western Start for Leone,7,3 February 2007,"This Italian film is where ol' Clint Eastwood got his first starring bid as the mysterious ""Man with No Name"". Although, in the film he is called Joe. That might just be a name given to him by the characters in the film (like a simple American name for the characters to call him by).An almost point-by-point Western remake of Akira Kurosawa's samurai film Yojimbo, the film demonstrates some of the underpinnings of director Sergio Leone's style, which he would go to perfect in the rest of the Man with No Name films. Although Sergio clearly learned a lot from the Japanese master as he imitated many of Kurosawa's framing choices, he also developed a strong style of his own through the film. Leone's use of both the extreme close up and the long angled shots became such a part of the Western language that it would be hard to go without seeing a Western without intense pre-gunfight extreme close-ups to the face and hands.The film's story, like Yojimbo's, is about a mysterious and deadly stranger that arrives in a town where two rival gangs are battling it out. Picking up an ally in the local tavern, he sets about bringing the downfall of the gangs for a fistful of dollars. It's not too complex a story and lends Sergio many chances to show his directorial style.The print that I viewed on DVD is unfortunately not in the best of health, but I suppose it can be expected for the film's budget and age. The dubbing on the film is quite terrible and threw me off at points during the film. I'm uncertain as to whether it was originally in Italian or the overdub is just plain bad. The lips didn't even match the words spoken much of the time.Of course, the film shows that it's still early in Leone's filmography. The scenes and packing of the film all seem a little rough. On the plus side, the music that the film employs is everything we've come to expect of Spaghetti Westerns and is quite amusing to listen to, with its strong motifs. Like many films in this series, the film also suffers a little from some characters being too simple or over-the-top. In this film, it's the laughing villain that's the most irritating, but all the characters seem to lack depth. This might be attributed to the source film, but Kurosawa was able to bring depth into the performances of his actors in his film. Leone does manage to do this in his later films, but here, they are seem like a grab-bag of caricatures, with the exception of the Man and the Villain and maybe the Ally. Maybe.Still, despite its roughness, it's still quite an entertaining film and the gunfights, as fast as they might be, helped define a style that would be copied in film after film for a long time. It's not an amazing or immense, film, but a good start to Leone's string of Westerns, which would only improve as time goes on. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon at all. 7/10.Note: The DVD that I saw doesn't feature an anamorphic widescreen and the picture clearly suffers from it when you try to watch it as a widescreen film. As the film is shot in 2.35:1 screen ratio, it's meant to be seen widescreen and I can only hope a new version is released with the film in anamorphic 2.35:1.",A Fistful of Dollars

Great job, I love it!The plot had good moments, one guy outplaying two big gangs. The way he did it - some things didn't seem too logical to me. Overall we get to see pretty good shootings, standoffs and explosions. Some quotes were VERY good and I will remember them.The cast was good, Eastwood is a Western legend. But also the rest of the cast did a great job for the important parts.The audio and subtitles sometimes were way off in my version, also when changing languages the experience was way different.Definitely one of the better Westerns, but not quite there yet for the highest rating in my book.",A Fistful of Dollars
143,illbebackreviews,This film is a classic and timeless Western film,6,8 January 2013,"There is no denying that Dollars is the most famous Western franchise ever and it is no surprise that the entire trilogy itself have been remarked as some of the greatest movies ever. A Fistful of Dollars is a film about an anonymous man who walks into territory that is continuously fought for ownership between the Baxters' and the Rojos'. Here, the stranger begins to cause further chaos by using each side to his advantage. This film is a cleverly planned out movie and has a few interesting characters, most notably the stranger played by the ever so great Clint Eastwood. Despite the characters seeming bland when compared to 'The Good the bad and the Ugly', the film itself is interesting even though every aspect of the film is lower than the final installment.The direction in the film is superb making the film move along very quickly with a lot of interesting elements to the film. The first film that I watched in this trilogy was the best: The Good the bad and the Ugly. Watching that, I fell in love with those characters but here the same cannot be said. The story in the third, despite being 3 hours long (Extended Ed.) was so enjoyable and entertaining that this film may seem like a let down but when looking at it on its own is clearly a Western masterpiece.The story is basic and easy to follow in this short 90 minute film. I loved how the movie ends soon after Joe shoots down the old man from the rope which we later see more of when he does the same to Tuco. The music, during the intro, did seem disappointed compared to the timeless masterpiece for the final installment. Everything about this film is very good and brilliant but still falls short of the third installment. Definitely a must see despite minor issues and is sure to be loved by all fans of Western movies.",A Fistful of Dollars
144,antagonist117,A strong remake that sets up even stronger sequels,7,17 June 2013,"A surprisingly faithful remake of ""Yojimbo"" (1961) considering the large temporal and geographical shift, this movie introduces uniquely Leoneian themes and details that would later find their fullest expression in ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly."" Like that film, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" features a bloodthirsty profiteer who dons a union army uniform, and a scheme regarding buried treasure in a graveyard. The Ennio Morricone score and the tricolor, gunpowder-inspired title sequence are also familiar hallmarks of Leone's collaborations with Eastwood. This is a fun movie that is best watched alongside its two superior sequels and ""Yojimbo.""",A Fistful of Dollars

The new man arrives into town and is told that he should not stay if he wants to live but it's obvious that he came to get money and that he will not stop until he does everything in his power to make it happen. Two divided families are brought into the massive fight for dominance over each other as Eastwood character tends to create opportunities for him to earn money. He befriended one of the town folks that helped him a lot and at the end he rescued him. Incredible manipulation of families made them spill the blood without getting him involved too much and he managed to get himself out of one of the complicated situation. As he recovered he brought fury and anger upon the Ramon and his family and killed them all in cold blood for what they did to him.

147,blakiepeterson,A Defining Spaghetti Western,8,2 May 2015,"Kanye West once declared that his presence was a present, but if Kanye West's presence is a present then Clint Eastwood's presence is comparable to that of a new yacht, a smattering of diamonds and gold bars, and a lifetime supply of fried chicken (and if not one of those gifts sounds enticing, then you probably don't exist). Eastwood is not the kind of actor that smells like a SAG meeting or a thespian conference. Rather, he possesses enviable tenacity, scowling as if he'd prefer to be angrily smoking on a dimly-lit street corner in Detroit, or somewhere dirtier. When he makes his first appearance in A Fistful of Dollars, I felt an uncontrollable urge to loudly ask ""who is that?"", despite being completely aware of his momentous career. Wearing a weathered cowboy hat, an armor-like poncho, a ten-day beard, and a hardened grimace, he looks considerably iconic. Eastwood remains nameless for the remainder of the film (most movie buffs refer to him simply as ""The Man With No Name""), but he doesn't need a title to define him. He is a presence.A Fistful of Dollars familiarized the world with the magnetism of Clint Eastwood, but it also popularized the Spaghetti Western (one could instead refer to it as the Italian Western, but that would be too politically correct), a now much-lampooned sub-genre that slapped the Hollywood western in the face and smacked some sense into its overtly bright and patriotic adventures. A gaga assembly line of close-ups, uncomfortable silences, sweat, and gunfights, the Spaghetti Western laughed at Roy Rogers and Randolph Scott hard. Riding into the sunset or wrangling an unruly horse were now stale, predictable. The Spaghetti Western pushed the Old West into the borders of Mexico and made sure to prove that violent sadism can be just as brilliantly conceived as a long- tracking shot in a healthily budgeted Hollywood thriller.The Man With No Name is billed as an anti-hero, a gunfighter almost as villainous as the said-villains but ultimately too clever to be marked as a stock rival. In A Fistful of Dollars, he finds himself in San Miguel, a tiny border town that is caught in the feud between two powerful families wanting to gain control of the territory. The Man With No Name sees opportunity among the bitter rivalry; by countering the families against each other, he would thereby receive the monetary benefits of the soon-to-be massacred parties. Truth be told, there are no nice people in A Fistful of Dollars. They are all so obsessed with furthering their own statuses that any sort of morality has been dead and gone for years, guns and money currently serving as the only forms of life's importance. Many have rendered the film as being a tepid exercise in arty bloodshed, but that would only be true if it had the same Technicolor innocence as a Roy Rogers or Randolph Scott movie (there those names are again!). I have always asked myself two questions when it comes to movie violence: (1) Does the violence feel out of place, not matched by the tone of previous scenes? (2) Do you leave the theater so disturbed by the carnage that it serves as the only thing you remember about the film a year later?Ultimately, these are probably stupid questions to ask, as they do not directly apply to A Fistful of Dollars. It creates and lives in its own universe. You aren't entirely sure what year it takes place in, where San Miguel actually sits, and how these characters became so outrageously handy when it comes to gun-play. Violence is a part of the equilibrium. In San Miguel, the kill-or-be-killed philosophy is shown in its truest form. No pistol parties would be as harmful as banning breathing.Sergio Leone is as inventive as Alfred Hitchcock or Steven Spielberg, but because he, along with his films, attract only a small demographic of people, his popularity wanes down to that of a cult filmmaker. For someone who promoted a new genre and perfected it single-handedly, he deserves much more credit. As his first hugely influential film, A Fistful of Dollars doesn't have the same unbearably tense patience of his Spaghetti masterpiece, Once Upon a Time in West, but it is so outwardly daring that you can still feel the aftershocks of the groundbreaking waves it made back in 1964. His style has been imitated time and time again, but still intact is that original underlying feeling that no one has done this before. It is a provocative and flashy work that walks alone on a dusty path in the desert of cinema. With its flaws in mind, saying Leone was finding his footing wouldn't be entirely accurate. In A Fistful of Dollars, you see him trying something unheard of with much luster, and it's immediately apparent that a snowball effect will ensue: The more movies Leone makes, the better they will get. Though he only directed a total of seven, they all contain enough personality to bolster the projects of director who has made hundreds of movies. A Fistful of Dollars is certainly one of them.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",A Fistful of Dollars

It still has Clint Eastwood as The Man With No-Name (even if the credits give him a name, Joe), the stylistic violence, terrible dubbing and mean performances. Like quite a few westerns (""The Magnificent Seven"") it took the basic plot from a Akira Kurosawa film, in this instance, ""Yojimbo"", but it dose not show, it is clearly a Sergio Leone movie.

152,mohit_sinsniwal,WOW!,7,1 June 2019,"A Fistful of Dollars (1964) in my opinion is the second best one in the spaghetti western series, that is Sergio Leone's first best masterpiece in ""Dollars Trilogy"", that started all. It is my personal favorite western movie of all time. I love this movie to death and I will always cherish it.A lot of people are going for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West and of course Eastwood's Unforgiven as their best favorite western films. But no one talks about this one: A Fistful of Dollars, which in my opinion is a classic & Sergio Leone's first masterpiece! This was the third Clint Eastwood's western film that I saw as a kid and I loved it every since. What can I say? Except I love this movie and it is my second favorite Clint Eastwood western movie. This one is in my top 5 Eastwood western films. I just love this movie to death and I love the story and the actors that it is in this film.This movie is shorter for only an hour and 39 minutes long, which is not boring, it is fast paced and it is filled with classic moments. A Fistful of Dollars is a classic and I can always watch and enjoy it, without been bored. Clint Eastwood stars as the greatest Western character of all time, ever created - ""The Man With No Name"" in the greatest Western of all time. The story is an unofficial reworking of the Akira Kurosawa film Yojimbo from 1961. What I love about this film is Clint Eastwood's character who helps out a young family, who is torn apart from the Rojo's gang, he make sure that the kid goes in to his mom's arms, Eastwood was a heart in this movie. Also you have nice shootouts, Eastwood wears a boiler plate as a bullet proof vest, while Ramón Rojo (Gian Maria Volontè) fires his Winchester '92 rifle at ""The Man With No Name"" brilliant! Than ""The Man With No Name"" kills them all with his colt, excellent! Ramón fires the Mitrailleuse machine gun, killing dozen of Mexican Soldiers, awesome! Gian Maria Volontè as Ramón Rojo was a terrific villain and he did awesome job.The plot start's faster and it is a stone cold classic that started all. Clint Eastwood is the coolest actor in the role playing the famous character of all time, that made him an icon. Every second on screen, he chews up the scenery and even today remains as bad ass as ever. Eastwood's character has been mimicked and copied numerous times over the years and yet he still stands up to modern scrutiny. Despite the character being so cool, there is still humor to be found, like the fact that he ALWAYS has that cigar in his mouth even when he's lying in bed. You also have the classic ""Mule"" scene which manages to be bad ass and funny at the same time. Sergio Leone directs everything to perfection and considering the film is from 1964, it's extremely well paced with plenty of action. The score was provided by Ennio Morricone, who for some reason is credited as Dan Savio. The music is another element that has been copied by practically every other Western since. It set the standard of what a Western could be and once you watch the film, the tune will go through your head for hours.Not only that this movie is a classic but two movies ripped off the story from this film: Bruce Willis's Last Man Standing (1996) which completely ripped off the story from this film and Sukiyaki Western Django (2007).This is the beginning of the Man With No Name series. The visuals are beautiful, the character of the Man With No Name menacing and mysterious, the score is brilliant and the action is a blast. The greatest ""spaghetti"" western ever. The one that launched a thousand copycat versions, even the wonderful score by Ennio Morricone. A Fistful of Dollars is a legendary, with bullets, as loud as the explosions and close ups extreme. The plot is simple (though not as much as the sequel, A Few Dollars More) but that is what enables Sergio to weave a masterpiece. Iconic score.A Fistful of Dollars gets a perfect 10 by me and remains my all time best favorite Eastwood Western movie in the series that I absolutely love to death and I love Clint Eastwood's character. It's a genre that doesn't get enough love and it really should as it deals with all the familiar elements of action films, like this one is.",A Fistful of Dollars
153,dkncd,A mysterious stranger rides into town,10,23 October 2007,"""A Fistful of Dollars"" is the first of Sergio Leone's ""Man with No Name"" trilogy of westerns. This film introduced the elements that would be used successfully throughout the trilogy: the sweeping scenes, well-constructed Western sets and costumes and a perfect score from Ennio Morricone.This film introduces Clint Eastwood in a role well-suited to him as the ""Man with No Name"", an enigmatic, stoic and perpetually smoking gunslinger. Eastwood's performance is the principal performance of the film, but the supporting performances are commendable too, particularly Gian Maria Volontè as the dastardly Ramón. All of the villains in this film are well-presented and made loathsome. Even supporting characters such as the barkeep or coffin-maker are memorable.The story starts with the ""Man with No Name"" riding into the Mexican town of San Miguel, which is in turmoil due to two rival families. This film capitalizes on the ambiguity of the intentions of the mysterious stranger and I liked how he was ultimately made a ""chessmaster"" figure that manipulates the situation. Interestingly, there is also a mysterious woman kept ambiguous for a lot of the film. An engaging story is developed with enough turns to keep it interesting for its relatively short duration. The gunfights in the film are also well-developed and tense, and the final conflict with an interesting twist is unforgettable.",A Fistful of Dollars

The film was visually pleasing to watch and that not to mention the glorious soundtrack.Imedialty from the start i was hooked. Visually, it was outstanding and with the help from the score, i really felt that i was riding along with Joe , in the beaming sun. At times things are slow but again the score and the visual keep you thriving in the desert. The story is based around two gangs . On one side there's the Rojos and on the other side, the Baxters. In the middle of this stands Clint Eastwood's Joe. I haven't watched any of his others westerns so i can't compare this role but i can easily say that after watching this film, I really can't wait to watch him again in similar roles. You know little of this man, all you know is that he just rode into town who quickly makes a dramatic arrival. His image is iconic and perfect . He stands out from the rest quite easily.If there was any negatives then it would be the acting which in some areas was mediocre but there's nothing which ruins the experience. As usual, you'll will get epic show downs and gun fights something that is expected from a western.

While nothing really stands out except for Clint's manliness, 'Fistful' paved the way for more famous westerns, and provided an entertaining 100 minutes any fan of the genre will appreciate, and can serve as a good start for newcomers.I call this 'Clint Eastwood Begins' because it was the rebirth of Clint's image, like Batman (play on the name).

""The Man with no Name"" is alongside ""Harry Callahan"" the character that most people think about when they hear the name Clint Eastwood, and this is definitely one of his best roles. Many have called it a corny and unimaginative character, I call it the contrary. ""The Man with no Name"" or ""Joe"" is one of the most enigmatic and clever roles ever conceived in the western genre. credit must also go to Sergio Leone for directing this great film, which has been imitated so many times in the following years, even by Clint Eastwood himself.This movie is one of the most famous Italo-Western movies, and was probably only overthrown by it's sequels. I must admit I was surprised when I read that this film was shot in Italy, the film was very authentic and believable and there's a reason it's called a Italo-Western movie.The only downside of this movie is if you watch the English dubbed version. Some voices can be really annoying, especially the child which was so obviously dubbed by and adult. Then again this is not Sergio Leones fault, I only mention this as a warning for you.The movie has obviously aged a bit, it has some uneven acting, and most of the dialogue has been dubbed, probably even in the original Italian version.

161,possumopossum,Not Your Average B-Flat Concert Western,9,11 May 2007,"This movie took a genre that was in trouble and turned it on its ear. Gone were the John Wayne and Marshall Dillon heroes who fought for right for right's own sake. Now, we had sheriffs who were cowards and bounty hunters who were heroes, though they were of questionable character. These ""heroes"", (or anti-heroes, if you will) were motivated to do the right thing by nothing more than making a profit.One thing that puzzles me about the so-called dollars trilogy...well...two things really. Why is Clint Eastwood's character called the Man With No Name. He has a name in all three of these movies. He's Joe in this one, Monco in FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, and Blondie in THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY. A marketing ploy, you say? All three of these movies speak for themselves, they're great. Not as great as ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, but they're great nevertheless. Also, none of these stories has anything to do with each other. There is no connecting thread whatsoever. Why are these called sequels or prequels to each other? This movie gave birth to three great icons; Clint Eastwood, Sergio Leone, and Ennio Morricone. These three were an unbeatable combination, although Leone and Morricone did okay without Clint, and Clint did pretty well for himself after he left the team. In this movie, Clint gives notice that he's here to kick ass and take names and you'd better be mighty clean living if you don't want him on your case. Great story, and probably a more realistic depiction of the west. (Come on, now, how many people could stand out in a sweltering southwestern sun without sweating and drawing flies, or stinking to high heaven? How many people bathed or brushed their teeth daily back then?) You really get a sense of living during that time in this movie, and others made by Leone. It makes you realize that the Old West wasn't as nice as many romanticized Hollywood Westerns portray it, although those movies, too are enjoyable in their own right. And the plots were cleverly set up, like Joe's plans. A great beginning for three great men in their fields of endeavor. 9 out of 10.",A Fistful of Dollars
162,SeriousJest,Spaghetti Westerns are all about the swagger!,6,9 March 2012,"Spaghetti Westerns were typically low-budget, with low-quality stunts, special effects, and technology. In this film, I had particular trouble accepting how idiotic the bad guys were. However, I quickly learned to appreciate that none of the foregoing is very important in this genre. Spaghetti Westerns are all about swagger: tough-guy posturing, catchy music, epic camera shots, cool artwork, and Western-chic outfits. In this movie, Eastwood helped to create his character's distinctive visual style. He bought the black jeans from a sport shop on Hollywood Boulevard, the hat came from a Santa Monica wardrobe firm, and the trademark black cigars came from a Beverly Hills store. Eastwood himself cut the cigars into three pieces to make them shorter.This film is not only entertaining, but it is most important for its iconic value. It is easy to see the influence that flicks like this one had on later works from great directors like Quentin Tarantino, who threw a proper budget behind the genre, and fused it with other genres, like gangster (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs), martial arts (Kill Bill: Vols. 1 & 2), and war (Inglourious Basterds) films. This year, Tarantino will also make Django Unchained, the closest film to a straight-up Western that he has made yetcan't wait.For more reviews and a kick-ass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com",A Fistful of Dollars
163,TankGuy,The wild west according to Sergio Leone,10,20 August 2014,"A mysterious stranger named Joe(CLINT EASTWOOD)rides into a dusty Mexican border town. He finds that the town is within the firm clench of two warring families, the proud Baxters and the thuggish Rojos.The two clans are locked in a bitter feud and the few remaining townsfolk live in the grip of fear. Seeing a strong chance to make a fast buck, Joe plays both families off against each other after the Rojos steal gold belonging to the Mexican government.The first film in cinematic genius Sergio Leone's groundbreaking Dollars trilogy, this is his vision of the 19th century American west. Leone destroyed the clichéd Hollywood myth of clean cut cowboys riding the range herding Cattle. It is more accurate to say the west was a Godforsaken environment in which violence was a way of life and hardship was common. This is how Leone seen it and showcased it in his Spaghetti westerns. At times, he would even satirise this scenario, which happens often over the course of the Dollars trilogy. To quote myself, I would say that Leone dismissed the childish myths of the American westerns as mere dime novel fantasies. In A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, he creates setting which is the darker opposite of what American directors were showing in their westerns. In Fistful, the town is a vice ridden melting pot in which the townsfolk are struggling to survive as they dream of a better life. The film is armed with a muscular script which is imaginatively written. Much of the dialogue is rich and also rather humorous.I think that the script contains some of the greatest and most memorable lines ever spoken in any film. The plot is engrossing and I doubt if there had been one similar to it in any film up to this point.Ennio Morricone's score cranks up the tension terrifically. This is one of the factors which made the final showdown truly gripping.Morricone's compositions would improve even more as his work with Leone went on. Fistful made an international star out of a then relatively unknown Clint Eastwood.In Fistful, Clint's Joe is a darker and more taciturn variation of the heroes depicted in the American westerns of the 40s and 50s.He melded his poncho wearing ""anti hero"" into something of a cult icon.The image of a towering, rugged and poncho clad Clint would become an enduring symbol of the 1960s and today represents the Spaghetti western in pop culture. Clint is awesome as the gunslinging stranger, it's a role that would have been impossible for any other actor to play. If you watch all of Clint's films right up to today, you'll see that he draws much inspiration from his role as the ""man with no name"" in the Dollars films.Gian Maria Volonte turned in a staunch performance as the evil Ramon Rojo,exploding with talent and blazing with intensity in his portray.The film's stylish cinematography impressed me greatly.The editing is snappy and I was also impressed with the taut camera angles. The top class action scenes that would become a staple of every other Spaghetti western are on full spectacular show here.The best scene in the film has to be the famous ""4 coffins"" scene. Here the dialogue is cleverly written, giving the scene a witty edge, but without detracting from it's suspense. The frenzied shootout at the Cemetery was absolutely exhilarating and expertly shot. Joe's vicious beating at the hands of the Rojos seared with gut wrenching brutality. It sets the standard for the cruel torture sequences that would become the norm for the formative Spaghettis. Briskly shot and packed with tight close-ups as well as fantastic stunts, the savage mass slaughter of the entire Baxter family was one of the most magnificent bloodbaths I've ever seen and the Machine gun massacre of the Mexican troops at the river was also crammed with rigid tension. The climatic confrontation between Joe and the Rojos changed the western showdown forever!. In this final sequence, Leone shows Joe to be an immortal avenger who appears from a cloud of dust to do battle with the forces of evil one last time. This sequence is an edge-of-your-seat ritual. I spent it's ensuing duration nervously biting into my fingers. The whole scene is just chillingly awe striking.Other Spaghetti western directors like Tessari,Corbucci,Lupo,Castellari,Valerii and the Marchent brothers owe much to Sergio Leone. He properly lit the fuse for what is, in my opinion, the greatest sub genre in film history. What I also believe to be the finest trilogy in the history of cinema shoots off to an utterly riveting start. This brilliance would remain consistent with the next two Dollars films. Leone paints a unique new portrait of the wild frontier, whilst at the same timed giving the legend a stunning,invigorating and eye opening new twist.10/10.",A Fistful of Dollars

At the time, this was one of the best westerns ever made. Not until Eastwood himself did, Unforgiven , did any western surpass the trilogy westerns of Clint.
Putting aside all the dubbing and voiceovers. The movie is believable to any western fan over 60. The music isn't bad either.",A Fistful of Dollars
165,pzanardo,Leone's revolutionary masterpiece,10,14 May 2001,"In every human activity, the most innovative, ground-breaking ideas of genius are very simple, ""a posteriori"". The two main ideas of genius ""Per un pugno di dollari"" is based on are: first, to put twenty shoot-outs in the movie, instead of the canonical two/three of the classical westerns; second, to erase any ""love interest"" from the story. This had the effect to enormously increase the action and strain in the movie, with an inebriating effect on the (naive) audiences of the early 1960's.I want to be more precise: the love affair between Ramon and Marisol (which is essentially a rape) is just instrumental to the development of the plot, and it remains on the background. In fact, Marisol utters no more than twenty words in the whole film. Nothing to do with the traditional ""love interest"", intended to attract the female audience. Needless to say, ""Per un pugno di dollari"" was hugely appreciated by women, too (and not just since young Clint Eastwood was so handsome, I guess). I for one consider ""Per un pugno di dollari"" the best work of Sergio Leone, even preferable to his subsequent masterpieces (which I extremely like, don't misunderstand me!). This movie was revolutionary from any point of view. Think to the music by Ennio Morricone, wholly original and non-standard, or to the innovative use of the camera, with the extreme close-ups of faces, boots, spurs and firing weapons. An unheard-of beastly violence and cruelty is combined with a sharp, dry, laconic but extremely wise-cracking dialogue (""Here you'll be at home"" ""I hope not. I was very bad at my home""). Indeed, the script is a triumph of cynical, black humour. All characters, especially Joe, the no-name gringo, share a total dedication to greed and violence which has something of a monastic vow. Some aspects of the movie are so conflicting that it seems impossible they can work together: take the ghastly realism of the tortures versus the impossible, almost magical skill of Joe and Ramon with fire-arms. Yet it works beautifully: that's Leone's huge talent. It is also worth noting that the movie was made with much accuracy, in spite of its very low budget.Few words about the story of its success can give a hint of the value of Leone's masterpiece. I was a kid when the movie was released in 1964, with NO PROMOTION AT ALL. I vividly remember that instant rumors spread off all over Italy: there was a fantastic movie, a must-see, don't miss it for any reason! Within few weeks everyone had seen the film and was commenting it.
I haven't seen ""Yojimbo"", the model for Leone's movie. However, indebted as it could be to that Kurosawa's work, it was ""Per un pugno di dollari"" which completely changed the western genre, and deeply influenced the style of action movies. Nobody can deny that ""Per un pugno di dollari"" is a mile-stone in the history of cinema.",A Fistful of Dollars
166,raphaklopper,The beginning of the best Age of Western movies.,10,3 October 2013,"After the great classic ""Yojimbo"" from the master Akira Kurosawa, the Italian Sergio Leone, known only by the great failure ""The Colossus of Rhodes"" decided to do the remake of the Japanese classic. None American production company wanted to produce the film because of the process that Japan put in Leone, and only managed to start producing and make the film in Spain. The budget was little, the actors were unknown, the failure that everyone thought was going to be today is considered a cinema classic.""A Fistul of Dollars"" begins with a strange cowboy who call himself Joe (Clint Eastwood), arriving in a small town on the Mexican border that suffers a war between two gangs. On one side the Americans ""Baxter's"" led by John Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy) and his wife Consuelo (Margarita Lozano), and on the other The Mexicans ""Rojos"" led by the Rojo brothers: Esteban (Sieghardt Rupp), Don Miguel Benito (Antonio Prieto Puerto) and Ramon (Gian Maria Volonte). Joe only sees in this rivalry a chance to gain an advantage working for the two gangs without them knowing, increasing the rivalry between them and just letting him in the end. But Joe barely knows that the Rojo's leader Ramon is not be underestimated, but neither is Joe. Yes, the plot of the film is identical to the classic ""Yojimbo"", but what Leone did with it, was magnificent.Before this film, the Western genre was dying. John Wayne was getting old and boring, and many others failed to capture the public's interest. What Leone did thanks to Kurosawa classic was simply redefine the Western genre putting: humor; tense moments; scary and disturbing villains; and Clint Eastwood.The biggest difference between this movie and the prior westerns and Yojimbo, is the ""hero"". The western hero was known for his ideals of justice and to do good; Joe is someone who seems cold and just wants to get advantage of situations thinking only of him and him alone. And Sanjuro, Yojimbo's hero, wanted to free the people of the city from the gang rivalry. Joe, at the end does the same thing only unintentionally. But not only the excellent performance of Eastwood as the anti - hero who stands as one of the best things in the film, but also the master Leone, giving not only a superb and humorous narrative to the film, but gives a hell of a direction.Leone not only managed to put the story of Yojimbo adapting perfectly to the style of the Old West, but it gave-it a humor but also violent and dark tone. And even with the small budget Leone capture unforgettable moments since the chilling duels scene with perfect close-ups on the characters capturing his nervousness before the shooting to come, and also beautiful landscapes and the huge Spain desert serving as the Mexican border.The film that at the time was considered a class B movie, but it had a great success in Europe and America. And thanks to Leone and his genius in both directions and script, picked the Japanese classic and transformed-it in a history of the old west, redefining the Western genre forever. Also thanks to formidable performance of Eastwood, starting his long career in style. Today this masterpiece is considered a classic of the cinema, and it isn't for nothing! 10/10",A Fistful of Dollars
167,The-Social-Introvert,Its worth more that a fistful of dollars!,8,24 August 2014,"This is the one that started it all. Sergio Leone's first film in the ""Dollars Trilogy"" is an unofficial remake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, and yet the Italian managed to make the film his own.The plot is simple enough. Mysterious gunslinger Clint Eastwood arrives in an apparent ghost town bossed by two rival families, and seizes the opportunity to makehem hem, a fistful of dollars for himself.Upon watching the film the first thing you will notice is the opening credits. Love it or hate it, you can't deny that this is one of the most unique opening creditsaround. I find it entertaining, if not a little ballistic, and more enjoyable than most of today's credits: you often see names you just don't care about fading in and out of the screen whilst the movie has already begun. Heck, the opening credits of this film tell a story of their own. And combine it with the now legendary whistling tune from Ennio Morricone, you know you're gonna be in for a treat.Whilst not as good as Leone's later work, A Fistful of Dollars serves as the template for his movies; all the trademarks are here, from the dark humor and detailed close-ups to the sweeping shots, whistling sounds to over-the-top bangs. The film is by no means perfect; constrained budgets are evident as it's pretty rough around the edges. Plus the dubbing at times is hilarious. And that's pretty much all the complaints I have.The man with no name. Arguably the most iconic character in cinema history. Its amazing how Leone found something special in a guy that was in silly B movies. Turns out the budget restrains did some good. His pose, appearance and cool one liners really make him a solid character well within the first fifteen minutes. The random bursts of music in the first half- hour of the film gives it a sense of mystery and foreboding.The movie is even more incredible when you remember that it was quite experimental. Leone and Morricone hadn't fully flowered yet, and still A Fistful of Dollars is known for their personal touches. This is where Morricone first used the iconic lonely whistling, guitar music, chorus, and unusual combinations which have been the base for music ever since in American westerns.It was a remarkable feat for an Italian director and Italian composer with Italian actors and films based on Italian culture to make it big in the US, and even more so that Leone's movies rose far higher than any other westerns, revolutionising the genre. Many of today's greatest directors (Scorsese, Tarrantino) admit to using ideas and formulas started by Sergio Leone.Not much to say about the story. Although it's good, the fim is a total remake.The final showdown is definitely the best part of the movie. The dynamite explosion triggers the trumpet score, and behind the smoke stands, alone, the man with no name up against around five Rojos. The music, extreme close ups, and perfect timing make for a fantastic final duel, with a really tense atmosphere. There are no goofy lines; words are spoken through the actors' faces and reactions. You just know as soon as the smoke clear that revenge of epic proportions is about to go down. Ramon's death is elevated through the use of the drums and spinning camera (used to show that his view is becoming steadily blurier and unfocused).Final Word: GreatA few minor flaws that in no way tarnish a solid timeless classic.My rating: 8/10Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2012/04/06/movie-review-a- fistful-of-dollars/",A Fistful of Dollars

Eastwood's role is a job well done, and thanks to director Sergio Leone, A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS works in a way that westerns never did. Definitely Eastwood's signature role in one of the greatest westerns of all-time.4 out of 5",A Fistful of Dollars
169,TheNabOwnzz,The Beginning of the Legend,9,25 April 2019,"Sergio Leone's first truly great film, a Fistful of Dollars, marks the start of his ascend into the levels of the all-time greats in terms of directors, and he has definitely shown what he was capable of and would be capable of in later years with this excellent picture.Of course, A Fistful of Dollars is a near literal adaptation of Kurosawa's Yojimbo (1961), and therefore the narrative structure and story does not tell us anything we do not already know. The story is in this sense quite weak, and gives us little of the artistic mind of Leone himself. However, the fascinating aspect of A Fistful of Dollars is how Leone films every single scene and every single situation. The combination between majestic widescreens and immersive close-ups of the sweaty faces to enhance intensity is a clear trademark of Leone, and his hand is unmistakable. The english dubbing was also in an experimental stage at this point, so that too sounds slightly off compared to Leone's later works.However, it becomes most apparent that A Fistful of Dollars's strength lies in the moments without dialogue. The hostage exchange or the lead up to the final gunfight are filmed mostly with close ups while Ennio Morricone's majestic score plays creating that typical trademark Leone magic into setting up for an important plot point. Due to the low budget available, some of the gunfights feature no bullet holes and/or blood, and blood that is shown looks more orangey instead of red, but again, Leone's direction shines through limited budgets and unoriginal storytelling.So, not only was A Fistful of Dollars the breakthrough for Leone, it was also the breakthrough of composer Morricone & actor Clint Eastwood, both of whom reached stardom in the years to come. Leone's direction was already extraordinary with this early picture, and the same is true for Morricone's score, blazing an epic trumpet and unconventional whistling throughout the picture, showing us his unique method of scoring films for the first time. No full scale orchestral scores like previous Hollywood westerns, but a somewhat singular sound lead by this operatic trumpet. Clint Eastwood also shines with his natural machismo screen presence, and forever made his mark on cinema in the scene in which he kills 4 adversaries for not apologizing to his mule.It was also quite unnatural for a western to sport a morally complex anti hero as a main character, instead of the black-and-white moralities many old westerns have given us. While the latter is not necessarily a bad thing, moral complexity does often times seem to create a more interesting and relatable protagonist, because pure goodness is often times too a fantasy in the real world. Pragmatists such as Eastwood's character Joe exist abundantly in the real world, and with the single line of dialogue after helping the family escape 'Because i knew someone like you once and there was no one there to help', he seemingly explains his abandonment of idealism in a single sentence, as this past event has possibly made him into the person he is today. Of course, there is still some character development in it, since when he saves the family, he abandons his pragmatic ways for a selfless deed, showing his partly good nature.A Fistful of Dollars is admittedly somewhat flawed, since it features weak dubbing & it has a story which except for some details is only a literal copy of a still slightly superior earlier film. However, Leone's hand is unmistakable, and his direction was already world quality in this early film, showing us his quality by mixing stunning widescreens with intimate close ups, while also containing many scenes of beautifully lit nighttime cinematography & pure visceral thrills with Morricone's score blazing through important moments, making sure that A Fistful of Dollars is still a masterful movie worthy of recognition.",A Fistful of Dollars
170,gottogorunning,Good Western,7,13 August 2005,"A Fistful of Dollars(1964) is a stylish western that begin the era of the Italian Western as well as being responsible for the rise to stardom for then TV actor, Clint Eastwood. He was not the first choice to play the main character but got the role due to the fact there no one left to offer the role to. Two people who were offered the role of the man with no name were Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda(four years later Charles Bronson takes the lead role in Once Upon a Time in the West after Clint Eastwood was the first choice for the part). A Fistful of Dollars was inspired and remade from Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo(1961). Many crew members from A Fistful of Dollars ended up directing themselves like for instance, Fernando Di Leo, Duccio Tessari, and Massimo Dallamano. Sergio gives a colorful and crude portrayal of The Wild West around the Texas-Mexico border. Both A Fistful of Dollars and Yojimbo are based on an obscure Italian play called ""the man with two masters"". This was also the film that introduced the cinema world to film musician, Ennio Morricone. Although not as good as later films, A Fistful of Dollars is still a terrific Western",A Fistful of Dollars
171,doug-balch,First Leone/Eastwood Western not that great,4,2 June 2010,"This isn't that great of a movie. It's best known as the first of the Sergio Leone Westerns. It is no doubt the worst of his films. It's pretty clear it had a very low budget. Worth watching just because it's interesting to see both Leone and Eastwood develop their styles progressively through the ""Dollar"" trilogy. Here's what I liked:Atmospheric music and high operatic style is of course the main positive quality of all Leone Westerns. Eastwood is very good as the ""Man With No Name"".Interesting scene where bandits dressed as American soldiers flip up the canvas on a covered wagon to reveal a machine gun, then surprise ambush a bunch of guys. Eastwood reused this idea in the beginning of ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"".Here's what I didn't like:Plot was very disjointed and confusing with all the back and forth between the two families.Too much gratuitous graphic violence.Supporting acting was terrible.Very few locations shots outside of the cheap town set.",A Fistful of Dollars

174,nmholland,"A Landmark in Cinematic History, Labeling the Genre ""Spaghetti Western""",9,19 June 2016,"A Fistful of Dollars is directed by Sergio Leone and stars Clint Eastwood as the Man With No Name (or ""Joe""). When Eastwood travels to a town in western Mexico, and accidentally gets involved in a rivalry between two local families, he must Clint Eastwood them to death, and try to keep the civilian deaths to a minimum, as well as stay alive himself.Many call A Fistful of Dollars the first spaghetti western, and they may be right. This was the film that established Eastwood's reputation of killing people with his pinky finger. Thanks to A Fistful of Dollars, Clint Eastwood is a name that almost everyone recognizes 40 years since its release. A Fistful of Dollars is not just a good western, it's a good film as a whole. Most of the elements work in its favor, and make the movie a great one overall.Easily the best attribute of A Fistful of Dollars is the suspense built up throughout the entire film, leading to the climax. This incredible level of tension is stacked up due to Sergio Leone's direction, the acting, specifically by Eastwood, and the fantastic script. The script takes bold turns, such as having two characters partake in a brief conversation prior to a shootout involving the two. Each and every action scene is much better with this suspense present than it would have been without out it. This tension is what so many action films are lacking today.The acting, as mentioned above, is outstanding as well. Clint Eastwood is one of many in the cast that delivers a great performance. Standing beside Eastwood is a cast that includes Marianne Koch as Marisol, the young woman being torn apart between the rivaling families in her town, and Gian Maria Volontè as Ramón, the greedy villain of the film that stands as a character wanting to kill and to steal. Besides the three actors mentioned, the rest of the cast does do well, they just don't exactly stick out next to the three leads.The direction, by Sergio Leone, is a great element of A Fistful of Dollars. As stated earlier, his clever direction sneaks in a layer of suspense on top of the already great film. His camera angles and movements add a feel of boldness to this film that is almost necessary for a story such as this one. Speaking of the story leads me to the script, which is also amazing. Of all the leading characters, Eastwood's ""Man With No Name"" (aka ""Joe"") probably has the least lines. This is a very brilliant thing to do with his character, because it makes the moments when he does speak much more significant. This is an astounding factor adding to the greatness of the movie as a whole.The score, composed by Ennio Morricone, is yet another aspect of the film I can't go without mentioning. The score for A Fistful of Dollars is a landmark in musical history, defining the score for all western films to come, led simply by subtle whistling and guitar music. Most of the score is more of the background type music, until an action sequence breaks out, which it then turns very intense, giving the atmosphere a feel of desperation, as if the audience is The Man With No Name, needing to survive the bloody gunfight that our protagonist is currently in.The only complaint I would take up with A Fistful of Dollars is the pacing of the film. There are a couple different moments where the film stalls, just a little. For instance, the opening scene. For about 2 to 3 minutes, we are given a slow tour of the setting through a camera tracking through the small Mexican village. These moments can drag on, and feel endless at specific points in the film. It's a very small nitpick, but it is an issue, and pulls the film below a perfect score by just a tad.In completion, A Fistful of Dollars is a landmark in cinematic history, marking itself as the first spaghetti western, and the film that made famous the amazingly talented Clint Eastwood. I'd recommend this film to anyone that would feel up to seeing it, because it's really worth anybody's time.",A Fistful of Dollars

Now I see it as one of the greatest Westerns ever.""Per un pugno di dollari"" is not the best of the dollar movies, but still extremely well done. Those who claims that Sergio Leone's direction here isn't as good as it would be later has got the wrong idea, with small budget he made everything as good as he could and succeeded well.Ennio Morricone's music is over the top (the opening credits are not to be missed) and there are great acting from Clint Eastwood, just as good as Toshiro Mifune in ""Yojimbo"".(Spoilers ahead)Sergio Leone did not just copy 'Yojimbo', even if some claim him to have been doing that. Just the end-duel between Eastwood and Volenté is the latent Leone motive: the gun cannot be beaten by the rifle - there is a new era of Western, where there is no place for rifles (John Wayne often carried rifle but The man with no name didn't use rifle much at all in the dollar-trilogy).Rating: 9 of 10.",A Fistful of Dollars

A Fistful of Dollars certainly wasn't, well it might have been slow-paced, but that's not a criticism. It wasn't boring, the plot was simple, and yet it worked. Every scene was well crafted and directed so carefully so that I was consistently interested in what was going on. Clint Eastwood definitely isn't the most terrific actor in the world but he is well cast in this part of the classic hero attempting to liberate innocent townspeople- and make some money in the process.

178,Wulfstan10,"""My mistake. Four coffins""",9,31 October 2005,"ALthough in many respects this film pales in comparison with Leone's later films, it is itself a brilliant cinematic achievement. In part, this is because its failings primarily appear to be due to constraints of budget (very small and highly uncertain) and time more than anything else. Even to the extent that the skills of Leone, Morricone, and others hadn't fully flowered yet, this film is incredible at how brilliantly it is handled for what is really a first-time go. Leone had worked on, and even directed, films before, but this is his first real foray in his own direction, and into a genre that he revolutionised and with which he became forever synonymous. Who can imagine westerns without at least thinking of Leone's films, while who can think of Leone without thinking of westerns (even though his last, and arguably greatest, film was a sort of gangster film)? Similarly, one should not criticize this film for being based on Yojimbo, for that film itself was based on an American story while A Fistful of Dollars really is very different in many key respects, not least of all Leone's visual style or his own sense of irony and symbolism derived from Italian precedents and Hollywood westerns.We also see the nascent Leone visual style here, with the close-up style and contrast of close-ups and long shots appearing. This alone sets it apart from previous films, westerns and non-westerns alike, and still provides for great visual treats that one can appreciate today.This film also ushered in Leone's obsession with details, hard faces, grungy people, etc., that also revolutionsed the genre.This films also marks the first brilliant score of Ennio Morricone. It is here that he introduced the lonely whistling, guitar music, chorus, and unusual combinations and styles that developed into the music that has become in the U.S. synonymous with westerns and duels in the same way that Leone's visuals and themes have. Despite its minor flaws, this is still a great film that is not only revolutionary but still great and fun to watch even today. Like Leone's other films, it is timeless. One must also admit that it is amazing that in the U.S. an Italian film maker basing his films partly in Italian culture and an Italian composer could come to so define and be synonymous with this genre that Americans had considered so uniquely American, and highlight its underlying universality. That alone reveals the greatness of the films, of which this is the first.",A Fistful of Dollars
179,xmdbx,A Classic Western,7,28 May 2019,"When watching a film years after its influence has ingrained itself into not only cinema but society as whole, it can be difficult to differentiate what aspects stand the test of time and what were merely blocks for greater works to build upon. A Fistful of Dollars is no different. Its influence is unquestionable but its flaws are also glaringly apparent.
The camera work is fantastic and the consistent wide shots transport the viewer into the setting. The score is also great, it matches the feelings of the film nicely. Clint Eastwood does an amazing job playing his character. His portrayal of the (now-classic) nonchalant vigilante is as good as anyone else has done it since.
The narrative leaves a bit to be desired but gets better as it goes on. The dubbing is, by modern standards, awful. It is a product of the times and makes it frustrating to watch at times.
I can imagine falling in love with this movie if I'd seen it when it came out but that wasn't possible for me. All of the cliches would've been something to see for the first time in context. Overall, it's a good movie whose influence is greater than that of its quality.",A Fistful of Dollars

Clint Eastwood (who else?) is the super-cool, amoral gunslinger who seeks to profit from the bloody struggle between two frontier families This massively influential film was where Clint Eastwood gave birth to his legendary Man With No Name, a grizzled, sharp-shooting loner who here profits from a small-town feud. He's the sort of guy who'll strike a match on your stubble, save your boy from a burning barn and steal your woman without a glance.This was the first spaghetti western, shot mainly on location in Spain's dusty landscapes by an international crew and cast. Whereas the traditional western had clear moral boundaries, between the good and the bad, the cowboys and the indians, director Leone chose a more ambiguous world and, in doing so, opened up the frontiers of a new and vibrant genre. Values are blurred, violence is stylised, the story is a steal from Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo and the score comes, of course, from Ennio Morricone.",A Fistful of Dollars
182,lawrence-14,A true classic of the genre,8,23 July 2000,"The first of Leone's spaghetti western trilogy is a classic, making a star out of Eastwood and changing the face of the western forever.  A Fistful Of Dollars is much shorter (and in parts) simpler than it's sequels, For A Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.  However, the hallmarks of the Dollars trilogy are well in place to ensure that first-time viewers will be thrilled by what they see and hear, stunning visuals and an unforgettable musical score.  The story sees Eastwood's 'Man With No Name' ride into a violent, Mexican border town in a memorable opening sequence.  From there, he learns of two warring families and begins to play them off against each other, slyly making money along the way from both sides.   This leads to one (of course, being the 'good family) party being killed by the other and 'Joe'(as he is reffered to by a coffin-maker) being caught out.  They beat him up and swear to kept him to toture him but he escapes and prepares to come back to battle his enemies in one, last big showdown. As in the other two Dollars films, the 'man with no name' is a complex character.  We know he is a ruthless, bounty hunter and is often after only money but we also see his softer side which questions what he is doing.  The style and script of A Fistful Of Dollars allows to see more of this than in the other two films.A Fistful Of Dollars arguably has two of the greatest sequels ever.  For A Few Dollars More was even more impressive with an amazingly tense atomsphere and was extremely exciting and full of twists and turns.  And, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, goes down as one of the most popular westerns, highly acclaimed by audiences and critics, with the majority felling it to be the best of the Dollars trilogy despite it's difference in style from Fistful and A Few More.  But, which ever Dollars western is the best, Fistful is a true classic of the genre.

183,donuthaters12,A Great Start To A Genre-Changing Trilogy,7,30 September 2013,"Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns are my transition to Western films in general. They were the first Western films that I truly appreciated. After Leone's trilogy, this led me to other western films like The Magnificent Seven and 3:10 To Yuma. A Fistful of Dollars was the first of the trilogy and in my opinion is the weakest out of the three.The film was written by a couple of writers, one of which includes Sergio Leone. This is the area of the film that I felt was the weakest as simple the plot may be, it lacks a strong build up to the memorable and exciting climax. The characters aren't as interesting in this film in comparison to the subsequent films, an example of poorly written characters in this film are The Baxters. They feel two dimensional and plain. I did enjoy the banter between Clint Eastwood and Jose Calvo. The dialogue in this film feels a lot more cheesier than the other films, most of it is good but there are moments that feels cringe-worthy. It is definitely a big risk in creating a protagonist with no background, it can be hard to empathise with but at the same time it allows the audience to become curious of the character and allows him to become unpredictable. The film's plot showcases the protagonist's greed and it's aftermath.The film's biggest strength is Leone's direction. Leone wanted to create something different from other westerns and focused on building tension between events making it much more effective. Leone has created something patient and at times quiet, in particular the first few minutes of the film. The film is definitely limited by it's budget, with the setting feeling plain and lifeless.Massimo Dallamano is the cinematographer of this film, and also for the next film. Dallamano and Leone has focused on using close ups and at times they are extreme. These shots are commonly found on iconic moments of the film, like the climax or the switch in the middle of the film. The film's overall look feels much more grittier, this may be due to budget constraints or the filmmakers are not as confident with their shots in comparison to the subsequent films. There is a particular scene, which I thought was beautifully done and the scene was the first time we see Eastwood uses his gun, having the camera placed low and shooting it on the point of view of the gun.One of the most memorable aspect of this film is the score. Ennio Morricone has created something that sticks with you and have you thinking of his score when you ever think of a Western situation. The beautiful sound of the guitar as it plays Eastwood out and that whistle that sticks with you throughout the film. The score is definitely influenced from the previous released Western films in that era but makes it his own. The score doesn't try to sound complicated or innovative but rather stripping it down, which fits the protagonist of the film.Eastwood definitely stands out in this film, as his character and his portrayal of it is the main reason people are so hooked to this film. Eastwood has created a character that makes the audience wonder and at times idolise as he never seems to get corrupted by the cliché things found in Westerns, aside from money of course. The other stand out in this film is Giari Maria Volonte playing the film's antagonist and Jose Calvo as Silvanito. Volonte creates a villain that doesn't feel over the top and times look really cool and slick, while Calvo plays as the comic relief supported by the banter between him and Eastwood.This film may not be perfect in my eyes, while other praise it. It definitely is an important film for me as it introduced me to a genre of film that I never thought I would appreciate. A Fistful of Dollars sets up the style and genre that is found on Leone's next few films.",A Fistful of Dollars

Clint Eastwood is way too awesome chewing on that cigar talking through his teeth in every scene. Cool as hell. The story had many plot turns and kept me interested throughout although the basic premise has now, 50 years later, become quite common and alsmot cliché. A stranger comes into a town that has an internal rivalvry and the newcomer stirs things up. We've seen it over and over by now and im sure it had been done before this movie Sergio Leone pulls it off very well and creates a lot of very cool scenes and picturesque shots.

187,paul_johnr,Leone blasts onto the scene,7,9 October 2006,"Those who are critical of European directors should take a long look at their impact on action films, particularly in the Western genre. When the average person thinks of movies with a Western theme, they will most likely recall the spaghetti trilogy by Sergio Leone and the several other films with Clint Eastwood that were influenced by it. After Leone and other European directors sank their teeth into this American niche, the earlier images of dandy cowboys, packed saloons, and neatly-arranged gun duels became cartoonish and subjects of parody.Although largely based on Akira Kurosawa's samurai film 'Yojimbo,' Sergio Leone still took the American Western in a different direction with 'Per un pugno di dollari' AKA 'Fistful of Dollars.' Leone made use of realist trends popular during the mid to late 1960s, bringing a new grittiness and level of violence to the screen. And of course, 'Fistful of Dollars' led to arguably the two greatest Westerns ever made, 'For a Few Dollars More' and 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,' both standards for action film-making.While not as successful as the other films of Leone's trilogy, 'Fistful of Dollars' is highly effective as an action tale. The script written by no fewer than ten people (including Leone and Clint Eastwood) has obvious plot gaps and is rather predictable, but Leone is very much at ease with his material and generates levels of drama that were rare in previous Westerns. Clint Eastwood, known only for smaller Western roles up to this point, is also teeming with the cold-blooded aura that made his name in cinema history.'Fistful of Dollars' lasts just one hour and 40 minutes, following Eastwood's nameless bounty hunter with his familiar cigar and poncho. Eastwood is out for cash besides toting an innate sense of justice, however brutal it may seem. At the film's opening, he rides into a Mexican border town called San Miguel, where two desperado families named the Rojos and Baxters are fighting for control of a trade route linking Mexico to the United States. Eastwood's motivation to set things right is found in Marisol (Marianne Koch), a young woman who has been taken by Ramón Rojo (Gian Maria Volontè) as a sex slave after her husband was accused of cheating in a poker game. Eastwood's deeds are unconventional, serving as an informant to both sides and playing the families off one another until they are wiped out and the 'disease' of the town has been eradicated.Eastwood's role as self-serving killer makes him a different type of antihero, one who draws the viewer's sympathies yet rests above and beyond the limits of normal behavior. This character is a tough one to bring off, but it completely works in 'Fistful of Dollars.' While we know very little about the character as a man, there are revealing moments that flesh him out and make him human. For instance, he is clearly against gratuitous violence and has a sense of humor in even the most dire situation. These will become motifs of Eastwood in his later roles, notably in the other Leone films and the 'Dirty Harry' series.Although this is clearly Eastwood's movie, the supporting cast is very good. Gian Maria Volontè easily gets under our skin as a trigger-happy playboy. The two townsfolk who befriend Eastwood are saloonkeeper Silvanito (José Calvo) and bearded mortician Piripero (Austrian actor Joseph Egger, who appears in 'For a Few Dollars More'); while not sidekicks, both men give humorous turns as his supporters. Antonio Prieto is demure as Rojo family head Don Miguel, while the female roles are adequately held by Marianne Koch and Margarita Lozano.As you would expect, Leone's film is heavily stylized, using frame-filling close-ups and perspectives that were unusual for its time. The cinematography of Massimo Dallamano and Federico Larraya is rich in detail, clearly showing the grain of wood, the dirt of trails, and the sky's azure. Roberto Cinquini and Alfonso Santacana provide decent editing and the sound by Elio Pacella is clear as a bell. Unfortunately, the dubbing of non-English actors is sub-par, but it is no worse than other European films of the 1960s. Ennio Morricone, a former classmate of Leone, uses a traditional orchestra and the wordless chorus that became his much-imitated trademark.For those wanting to grasp the impact of spaghetti Westerns, there is no better place to start than with 'Fistful of Dollars,' which should be viewed before the other films in Leone's trilogy and his landmark 'Once Upon a Time in the West.' 'Fistful' is available as a separate DVD and as part of a 'Man With No Name' boxed set from MGM/UA Home Video. The film is presented in dual letter box and standard format, although you would be crazy not to watch 'Fistful' in its original aspect ratio. The MGM print is in very good condition with distinguishable colors and few artifacts. English and French subtitles are provided with Dolby enhancement of the original mono track. MGM has once again provided the theatrical trailer as an extra and nothing more. Surely, there is an interview of Leone and Eastwood out there somewhere.Take note that many of the cast and crew members are listed with American-sounding aliases in the opening credits.*** out of 4",A Fistful of Dollars
188,Aomalle27,Enjoyable western romp...,9,30 April 2008,"This is another Akira Kurosawa film translated into a more American friendly medium of the time, the Western. It's also another successful translation. Like The Magnificent Seven, Fistful of dollars is a perfect story to retell in the Western genre. A mercenary stumbles upon a town just south of the border run by two competing families. The Baxter's and the Rojo brothers compete over the rich spoils of gun running and rum running. Two deadly vices, guns and liquor, that if used improperly spell doom. But what becomes deadliest of all is a creative mind with the where-with-all to pit the two families against each other, and collect bounty from both. The man with no name chooses no sides but his own. He sidles up to both families, and collects money from both for his services, neither side realizing their diminishing stock of men and money until it's too late. The Achilles heel of our protagonist is his humanity for the peasant woman stolen from her family by the ruthless Ramon, head of the Rojo family. The deadliest shot with a winchester, and a criminal genius who himself has done away with two fractious sides, the US army and the Mexican army, when he sabotages an arranged arms deal between the two. He slaughters both sides and steals both the arms the US army was going to sell, and the currency the Mexican were going to pay. It's interesting that a man playing both sides in a colossal con, would himself be caught up in a similar scheme being played against him. This isn't your standard shoot em up, where the hero's invincible, and wins merely because he's the best. This is a true character that's flawed, vulnerable, and can conquer his adversaries only through grit, wit, and determination. He's one man against the world, which is a common motif of life in general. No one can achieve victory by skill alone.",A Fistful of Dollars

There are definitely a few times where you watch it and you can tell it feels a bit dated by some of the stuff that goes on and the plot is a little weak in some areas - but these are all forgivable things when you consider it came out 50 years ago and I think in some ways we have improved upon things in cinema over those 50 years; but there is no question that this film helped pave the way for many films to come.

190,Ismaninb,A milestone,8,8 April 2007,"A Fistfull of Dollars may have many flaws, as other reviewers correctly have pointed out, it is still a very important movie. Its indirect influences are felt until today. It did not come out of the blue of course, so I'd like to concentrate on its roots. To understand A Fistfull of Dollars fully, we must know the circumstances. Italian cinema has known two directions. Fellini, Visconti and others represented the artistic branch. At the other hand Italian B-movies usually were low in every aspect: low budget, low profile, low quality, low profit, low running time. Some actors and directors used English pseudonyms; sometimes American B-actors were hired to give the movie an American flavor. The working title The Magnificent Stranger had also this intention (compare the title Gunfight at High Noon; very easy to guess were they got the inspiration from). Amongst others Ben Hur was partially shot in Cinecitta near Rome. That is how Leone and his crew got their education. They would use it fruitfully a couple of years later. Coincidence wanted, that American western had reached a dead alley. A movie like The Magnificent Seven illustrated this. After a promising beginning it bogged down in endless chit chat. In the beginning of the 60's the sword and sandal genre was dying. So Italian directors had to look somewhere else. As the German western Winnetou with Lex Barker was quite a success, the Italians decided to give it a try as well. Leone was one of them. Elsewhere you can read about the ridiculous budget, the stolen script, the restrictions. A Fistfull of Dollars had all the ingredients of a cheap Italian B-movie. The difference was Leone's and Eastwood's ambition. Both brought in their ideas. Leone's epic pretensions can be seen in the battle scene near the river. Out of necessity he had to lean on film noir ingredients. These mixed very well with Eastwood's creation of the lone cynical antihero and Volonte's psychotic role. A Fistfull of Dollars indeed is not the first spaghetti western. It certainly is a big step forward in developing the genre. The black, cynical approach is already there. It is a first try to turn the art of movie making upside down. Leone's (and Eastwood's) revolution would succeed and the world of cinema would never be the same anymore; neither would movie villains and anti-heroes. This makes A Fistfull of Dollars a milestone. The European public immediately recognized its importance. America had to wait a few years yet and the critics even a few decades. Leone and Eastwood did not care; the success allowed them to fulfill their ambitions. So everyone, who pretends to be a connoisseur, should see this one.",A Fistful of Dollars
191,michaelheiser-25099,Good western film,7,14 November 2021,"The plot is simple (and even more so if you've seen Yojimbo). Clint Eastwood rides into town and discovers two warring factions. He uses the animosity they have for each other for his own gain. Like I said, it's simple. But the film's simplicity extends beyond the plot. Partially for budgetary reasons and partially the result of some judicious cutting and editing, there's very little in the way of fat. For example, the dialogue in A Fistful of Dollars is often very minimal. Considering the fact that he's the lead performer, Clint Eastwood's character has very few lines. Instead, Leone and Eastwood allow a look, an action, or a note from Morricone's incredible score to speak for Clint. Simple? - yes, but very effective. Beyond Leone's direction, Morricone's score, and the style of the Spaghetti Western, A Fistful of Dollars excels in several other areas - especially the acting. For the budget the film was made on, the acting is superb. Eastwood and his minimalist ""Man with No Name"" may be the known quantity, but there are other, equally impressive performances in the movie. Chief among them is Gian Maria Volontè as the crazed Ramon. It's an amazing piece of work. As much as I enjoy Eastwood, it's Volontè that makes the movie for me.",A Fistful of Dollars

Unfortunately, I was only able to see it once, but it was an intelligently made movie and Eastwood's portrayal of the Man with No Name was superb. If I could, I'd watch it over and over again. Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood make a great team working together in these ""spaghetti westerns."" The musical score made me want to listen to it over and over again. I give this film a solid score of 10/10. It made me want to run off and watch the next installment of the trilogy.

194,yellowtail_tuna,Clint Eastwood as a Western icon,8,15 September 2020,"When I think about Western, the first thing that occurs to me is the image of Clint Eastwood in Dollars Trilogy. In an early scene in A Fistful of Dollars, Eastwood, or the Stranger, with a beard, wearing a cowboy hat and a poncho, is standing in the dusty town road blown in the wind. It is a Western icon.After having impressed his gun skills on the people, his strategy goes on a manipulation where he tries to pit the two gang groups against each other. Aside from gunfight, he is also good at spying. He sneaks somewhere, witnesses, and eavesdrops something. Through the camera that follows him, we can grasp the entire situation.A dissatisfaction to me is the Stranger's character. He is visually cool, and I like to watch him doing something, but I don't really understand his personality. What does he want the most, money, adventure, or justice? Maybe I am being too harsh because I am comparing this film with the unofficial original film Yojimbo, where the protagonist played by Toshiro Mifune is much more attractive to me.But still, I was compelled to the film to the ending. The location is almost limited to the small town, and many events happen indoor, or at night. That gives the film a suspenseful mood. As the Stranger is often sneaking or hiding, it is thrilling to watch if he is found or not. So I think half of this is a spy film. Set in Mexico, I am also attracted by the landscape of white walls. It is beautiful.",A Fistful of Dollars

The year is 1964, the third and greatest installment in the Bond franchise, Goldfinger has just premiered and just when you thought things couldn't get any better The Man with no Name explodes into the big screens.I personally am not a western fan but I completely fell in love with this film. What is ground breaking about it is that it's realistic in the sense of violence and surrounding. The John Wayne films were too patriotic, with bandits and the south breaking away I think the west was probably the least patriotic part in American history. We had a civil war and half the country didn't want to be part of the United States. Not to mention laws being broken in every town and bandits running lose. And racism was at it's highest. The appeal I found in a Fistful of Dollars were the characters and style. Clint Eastwood and director Sergio Leone made this film what it is. Sure it's a remake but it feels like a rebirth in the western genre and in the film industry as well. The character of Man with no Name is perhaps the greatest character ever created because he is legendary. The character is like King Arthur or Robin Hood, with the exception that he's more of an archangel. He comes in to this town where he witnesses these feuding families (more like a mafia) who together are tormenting this town. He saves the town and disappears. Who is he? Why did he do it? Who knows but like a legend his stories will be around millions of year with each generation exaggerating his story.

196,ga-bsi,A fist full of dollars: The steely eyed masterpiece that started it all,8,30 November 2007,"I watched the movie. I knew Clint Eastwood as the hard skinned and cocky cop that is Dirty Harry. Or maybe the aging cowboy who was out for just one last ride on his mule.But then I watched A Fist Full Of Dollars and new why this one had started them all. Gritty, steely eyed and lean, Eastwood was a prime choice for this Italian made film. I also learnt the meaning of ""Spaghetti Westerns"" as most of the cast and crew were of course from Italy.Yes, the acting was not spectacular, the plot was stark and simple. Of course it involved an old inn keeper, a blood thirst gang and a proud family that was led by an iron willed mother and a beautiful woman who didn't have much to say. And what Western would be complete without a crazy old undertaker? It could have been just another western, fell in and been rather mediocre, forgotten because it was just another Italian western flick with actors who were clearly being dubbed. But then again, it had Eastwood and he was what saved it.His gravelly voice, that cigar chewing bit and the legs that were of course much longer than the average man's. He of course, is the only one in the cast who doesn't have a very hectic tan, and he seems to be constantly on the verge of sleep. But when he starts talking, riding into town like he's always been there, and not caring that half the townsfolk are absent or deceased, or that the most lively place in town is the cemetery, you've got me sold. How can we forget him actually not having a true name? Wearing a poncho that looks about as old as the movie itself and talking about his horse like he's a human? But the good part is that he's not all bad. He's got a good side, as hard as it may be to find it, and helps out a desperate woman an old inn keeper, not to mention finally setting the town's people free.It was the flick that started all the others, made it okay to imagine that high noon wasn't just lunch hour, but the time for a pistol draw.The haunting score that composer Ennio Morricano put together, the whistling sound of a dual, that gets your eyes squinting against an imaginary sun and chewing tobacco that isn't really there.And finally the fantasy of being able to draw a gun as fast as the lunge of a cobra, and with as much deadly aim.A Fist Full Of Dollars is a cult classic.It's about what most of life entails, villains, damsels in distress and wanting to earn the occasion dime anyway we can- minus the horse and the poncho though.",A Fistful of Dollars

This movie is not only the beginning of a legend, as is the man with no name, but is a particular vision of life in west where men, without origin or destination, are wandering, with their fate only, to have only a few dollars. So, far from deep thoughts about morality or conceptions about the good and evil, we are faced a film where the bad guys are really bad and the good one is only looking for justice, the other situations are common in a lawless west.But what do they make this movie a classic of the genre? Where to start, from the wonderful music of Ennio Morricone, action and cynicism of Eastwood role, the masterful direction of Leone, a nimble edition that allows no dull moment for the viewer, a screenplay about hate and revenge, photography and art design that, both, create the right atmosphere for a western and some other performances that allow generate feelings of rejection or sympathy for some characters.

200,ikizdevran-882-254684,This is the man with no name. Danger fits him like a glove.,7,4 August 2018,"""A Fistful of Dollars"" is about a lone cowboy who plays double between two rival gangs for his own benefits. What a smart and talented gunman can do in the deserts of the west, is also one of the subjects Sergio Leone wants to show us in his film. ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is not purely about a bunch of cowboys killing each other for no good reason. The story is not very deep and everything happens directly in front of the audience. It doesn't have any hidden messages, it doesn't have any U-turns or plot twists. The story of ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is direct and easy to understand. What is beautiful in the film, beside its casting and story, are the landscapes, soundtracks, that follow the story almost all the time, and Sergio Leone's style of visual direction. His direction techniques show us all the facial expressions of the people with extreme close-ups, and this technique helps audience understand what is going on in that particular scene without the need of a conversation. ""A Fistful of Dollars"" shows us the technical beauty of cinema. This style of Sergio Leone is inherited from the Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, and ""A Fistful of Dollars"" was inspired by one of his films, Yojimbo (1961). ""A Fistful of Dollars"" also introduces us the rising star of Western films, Clint Eastwood, in the absence of Wayne and Honda. Back in 1964, when this film was made, Henry Fonda was already 59 years old and John Wayne 57. They were still making films back then, but by casting Clint Eastwood for his film, Sergio Leone has introduced an alternative star for this genre.""A Fistful of Dollars"" is a Spaghetti Western. It is a subgenre of Western and also called as Italian Western. This genre was born in the mid-60s because of the distinctive film making style of the Italian director Sergio Leone. American critics were using the name, Spaghetti Western, to describe the Western films made by Italians. ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is an International co-production between Italy, West Germany and Spain. When it was being made, no one was guessing it is going to be successful. Back then, Sergio Leone was thinking that Italians still react positively to American Western films. So, he took the idea and developed it in Italy. Sergio Leone was not a well-known director back then. This created risk for the production companies to produce this film, not only because of an unknown director but also because of its genre. After all, Europeans particularly Italians were not very familiar with the idea of American Western films. Eventually, the film was released on September 1964 in Italy. Its original release is in Italian. Because of its vast success, both financially and critically in Italy, it was released in the United States in 1967 with its English dubbed version.""A Fistful of Dollars"" is the first film of the Dollars Trilogy which is also known as The Man with No Name trilogy. The story in these films are not related. The stage names of Clint Eastwood are different in all three films, and they can be watched as standalones. The reason why they are considered a trilogy is because all three films are directed by the same director and the leading actor, even though he is a different character, wears the same clothes, talks and smokes the same in all the films. In order to understand Spaghetti Westerns, you must watch this trilogy. All three films were later released in sequence in the United States which led Clint Eastwood to stardom. The film techniques of Sergio Leone can be easily spotted in the films directed by Clint Eastwood later on. Sergio Leone highly influenced Clint Eastwood as a director, therefore in order to understand the directing style of Clint Eastwood, you need to familiarize yourself with these unique examples of Sergio Leone.""A Fistful of Dollars"", influenced a lot other films that follows it. Today it is still popular and considered a masterpiece. With its 100 minutes of runtime, it is the shortest film of the trilogy. It was made with a budget of $200.000-$250.000 and grossed up to $14.5 Million which is considered a huge amount for a European western film. This encouraged the trilogy to be born, and from this point of view, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is a significant film. Until it has reached to fame, it went through very challenging times. Despite the communication problems in the set, bad release dates and extremely negative reviews from Italian critics, this film managed to find its way to become a historical film.",A Fistful of Dollars

Clint's character is more tougher or better when he has a good supporting character to play off of (like lee van clef or eli from Leone's other films). Gian as Ramon was alright, but he just doesn't have enough depth to his character to really get the film going and make Clint seem more renegade. Some parts of the film are really dark, other parts are barely audible, but hey Leone had to start from somewhere. I would suggest watching this film though because it's still better than a lot of westerns out there.

However, the formula of Leone, Eastwood, no-name foreign cast and minimalist score doesn't work here.First, Eastwood's performance is not the best. If this had been the usual quality of his acting he would not have become the star he is.Second, far from being the 'antihero' Eastwood is an unbelievable altruistic saint in this picture. Worse, we have no real motive for his saintliness. To add to the confusion, he is set up as an amoral opportunistic killer. Bad writing here. The script fails in other ways, as if the writer wasn't even a journeymen but on his first effort. There are too many scenes that aren't believable but are inserted merely to give information to the viewer. The bartender's instant friendship with Eastwood, without cause or development is an example.Also, admittedly a drama in which we suspend belief, but when the Rojo's burn down the Baxter's house and kill them, the Baxter's complete and total passive co-operation in this deed is too unbelievable. Leone's directing was spotty: some good, some bad. One scene especially is bad: when Eastwood escaped from the Rojo's home after being brutally beaten. It's as if Leone wasn't sure how to get Eastwood out of this predicament so he just made the scene as confusing as possible.The picture suffers from the usual bad Italian sound track.The essential plot was good, just poor writing and execution and too many unbelievable elements.",A Fistful of Dollars

205,dsalouk,Whistles and cigars,7,19 February 2017,"A Fistful of Dollars is the beginning of a beautiful relationship between Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood. Being their first work together, the film creates an iconic western character out of Eastwood; the man with no name. What really helps set the tone is the music. The bells, the whistles, and the percussion create a suspenseful atmosphere where the dark grim frown painted on Eastwood's face says it all. Limiting his lines, every word Eastwood mutters holds weight and sway, and with his swagger and charm, he carries each scene with ease. Although there are flamboyant death scenes, acted to the point of over- dramatization, hence the labeling of a spaghetti western, A Fistful of dollars is a subtle work of art. Not as good as the later ventures between the Italian director and his star, but a damn good start.",A Fistful of Dollars
206,souther02,A casual comparison of the three Blondies,10,21 August 2012,"If you say the three spaghetti Westerns Eastwood began his movie career with are a trilogy, then I say that this is true as a way of marketing Sergio Leone movies made in Spain. This is nothing I'd argue with, because it does lead a person to see the three movies. They are crafted in the same way. Gina Maria Volonte plays the tough in the first two, and was ""replaced"" by Eli Wallach, who is the outlaw Tuco. Wallach is much better for the part in TGTB&TU, because of Tuco's style and his sense of humor. Whereas Ramon and El Indio only had a sadistic laugh. All three of the main characters in the Dollars movies were shootists, as was The Colonel. In many ways, A Fistful Of Dollars is my favorite of the Trilogy. It was nearly in the ""B"" movie category. Yet it was made better.A Few Dollars More was a movie that put the viewer in a position where the person has ""no amore, no sun, and no popcorn""(Groggy). What I mean is A Few Dollars More is a movie you cannot miss any of, from beginning to end. Even if you stop the player, you will miss something. Because the Van Cleef movie is very complex. It is also more elaborate. I would never try to watch A Few Dollars More on television. The other reason I like A Fistful Of Dollars so much is there are several characters that star as ""good""..Pepe Calvo, the store owner, and Joe Egger, the undertaker. They have character depth and are integral to the entire film.",A Fistful of Dollars
207,AngryChainsaw,My Cenzure of magazin Times review for this remarkable movie,9,20 February 2019,"Because of such statements, the pop magnate of the Time magazine for such a masterpiece, if we take the circumstances of the film, is a recording budget, and because of the small budget, the whole casting was done in Italy with the majority and the Italian * half-actors * this film, which was acquired world glory and that there are no men of men older than 35 who did not look at him, and therefore represent a treasure of Italian-American cinema and can be said freely and worldly. If I had sued at the site of Clint, I would have sued the then editor of the magazine for such pidlich and low comments, and a journalist who published the entire text. A shame is the rating of an even shameful journalist, which is for every conviction. Shame!!!",A Fistful of Dollars
208,keuhkokala,An Ugly is missing,7,10 February 2005,"In Sergio Leone's best westerns there usually are three main characters, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Actually all are more or less bad, but the Bad is the baddest and the Ugly somewhere in between. In For a Few Dollars more, the Good was Mortimer, the Bad El Indio and the Ugly Clint Eastwood's Monco. In the timeless masterpiece, Once Upon a Time in the West, the good is Harmonica, the Bad Frank and the Ugly Cheyenne. And I probably won't have to explain who the three were in the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. So, my problem with this movie was, that there was no Ugly. The good is obviously Clint, the Bad is Ramon, but there is no Ugly. This is probably due to the fact that this is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo (which I have to admit, I haven't seen yet) and the story has to be faithful to the original one. Too bad, because Leone's best talent is to tell a hate-revenge-greed-stories by the personalities of his three heroes. This comes best alive in the duel sequences. This one also misses one. The final shootout, when Ramon tries to shoot Joe, is good, but not as masterful than in the three following westerns.But even if this one isn't as good as the other Leone westerns, it's still quite good. Ennio Morricone's music is wonderful and has already some prototypes of the themes he would use in Once Upon a Time in the West. Although the dubbing is horrible, the people playing townsfolk, like the Innkeeper or the Coffin-maker are great. Sadly, the Baxter gang is left to the background as the story tells more about the Rojos and Joe's unholy war against them.*** 1/2 (7/10) The Best Part (SPOILER): As the shootout isn't the high point of the movie, I'll have to choose Joe's escape from the torturing Rojos. Eastwood looks really painful and you'll actually be worried about whether the hunting Rojos will find him or not.",A Fistful of Dollars

He is super cool, has that special ""look"" (figuratively and literally) and he always fully immerses himself into his role! Pure dedication!The story is really good and clear if you pay attention. Sergio Leone does a wonderful job at building towards the climax and then ultimately delivers us, the audience, a pretty satisfying conclusion. You absolutely root for our hero to come out of this film alive and well.Of course I would be remissed if I didn't talk about Ennio Morricone's soundtrack! The late, great Ennio Morricone gave us so many incredible musical pieces over the many decades!
In 'A Fistful of Dollars' he brings us this great, uplifting and very spiritual Western theme! It is really beautiful to listen to and it is very easy to remember and recognize!Out of all three 'Dollar' movies, this is the one that is the most held back and rather small in scale and scope compared to the other two.Clint Eastwood sticking a cigar inside his mouth while his face is in a close-up never gets old or boring!Overall, 'A Fistful of Dollars' is a glorious Western with a lot of heart and soul!

You cannot fault it. The undertaker is funny, his friend, Silvanito is brilliant and shows the value of true friends. Ramon is in his element as the bad guy.

213,charlesem,What started it all,7,12 March 2017,"My father was a huge fan of Westerns, which meant that whenever one was on TV -- which in the 1950s and '60s was almost all the time -- the set was tuned to Gunsmoke or Bonanza or Laramie or Rawhide or whatever. And naturally, that meant my adolescent rebellion took its course into a distaste for the genre. Which is why the ""spaghetti Western"" phenomenon escaped my notice in its heyday. Having had my exposure to Clint Eastwood on Rawhide, I was certainly not going to pay money to see him in a theater. Perhaps if you had told me that A Fistful of Dollars was based on (or stolen from) Yojimbo (Akira Kurosawa, 1961), I might have been curious. But it was not until years later, when people began talking about Sergio Leone as an auteur, that my curiosity about the movie was piqued. By then I had overcome my indifference to Westerns, having learned that they were the essential American Myth, and having admired Stagecoach (John Ford, 1939) and Red River (Howard Hawks, 1948), so I was intrigued enough to check it out. I still think A Fistful of Dollars is a shade on the primitive side, and that Eastwood occasionally shows his discomfort at being directed by a man who doesn't speak English, but it holds up, not only as a precursor of the compelling violence of The Wild Bunch (Sam Peckinpah, 1969) and as a landmark in Eastwood's extraordinary career, but also as a tour de force: a Western filmed in Spain by an Italian with a polyglot cast. Best of all, it established the career of Ennio Morricone as one of the great film composers. (charlesmatthews.blogspot.com)",A Fistful of Dollars
214,naaarfDE,A primary template for films like MAD MAX,7,8 August 2020,Sergio Leone uses Eastwood perfectly to transform a stereotypical into an archetypical character. And therefore A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS feels like one of the primary templates for films like MAD MAX. So Leone's film compensates on a meta-level what it lacks in plot. Because the one at hand feels kind of forced and overly construed towards the end.,A Fistful of Dollars
215,SilkTork,No Name,5,31 August 2003,"I don't get the fuss about this film - indeed all of Leone's films. Badly made and badly acted. It's supposed to be about the slow movement and timing isn't it? Gee, and I thought movies were about a little more than that. I suppose if Leone convinced himself he was a great film maker then he could convince other people as well. Full credit for making reasonably enjoyable films on a spaghetti budget, but without Clint Eastwood this would be a wooden spoon.",A Fistful of Dollars
216,MovieSoup,Oh Boy do I love spaghetti,9,10 November 2018,"A fistful of Dollars has become one of those timeless films that has etched itself into popular culture. The film follows a gunslinger (Eastwood) attempts to rescue a town from two rival gangs. It is, in my mind, one of the best ""spaghetti westerns"" ever made and has a unique perspective on the western as a genre. A fistful of dollars was a game changer and gave a grittier take on the western revealing a realistic and violent side to a genre that was dying a slow death at the box office.Sergio Leone's direction and vision for this film is masterful and his use shadow and unique lighting techniques really add a texture to the film unlike any western before it. Leone's work would go on to inspire heaps of Directors such as Tarantino when he worked on Django and Hateful 8.Clint Eastwood gives his best performance as the gunslinger called ""No Name"" or the ""Americano"". His stoic performance and Anti Hero attitude is perfect in every way, in fact it's slightly unbelievable how his stare and the way he carries himself can tell us more about his motives than any dialogue could ever do. This is especially effective in the shoot-out scenes and provides a real tension and an apprehensive atmosphere.The story itself is fast paced and very violent which adds a sense of realism to the picture and makes us care for the characters and their plight. I love that the scenes aren't full of expository dialogue or needless explanations. It keeps the story nice and simple with two rival gangs at each other's throats and ""NO Name"" in the middle. There are a few side plots that help drive the main plot along and fit perfectly into the narrative.Okay so onto a little problem I had with the film that made it difficult in some places. Some times in certain scenes the lighting does fall a little flat. It looks as if they shot some scenes in daytime and the dampened the colour contrast to appear like twilight or early dawn. This is probably a due to the time in which it was made but it took me a little out of the movie. Literally I sat there and was like ""what's wrong with the sky"".The actors lip movements don't add up to what they are saying as well which is quite noticeable in certain scenes. As I said these problems may have to do with the time it was made in and Leone made it work as best as he could. It certainly does not destroy the movie but when you are not fully engrossed in the film because you are wondering what about background inconsistences it is a bit distracting.The scenes of violence and gore were really ground breaking for their time as most westerns just focused on people shooting at each other and no consequences came from it. In this film we see people mourning over their dead and sadness is a major part of the film. We also see people being crushed or stabbed to death. Leone was obviously going for entertaining realism when shooting this film and it absolutely paid off.The grit of this film and the way ""No Name"" is neither a good person nor bad is completely engrossing. Before this film the good guys wore white hats and the bad guys wore black, in this there are no black or white hats as we see the world for what it is. ""No Name"" wears a brown hat to show we are not in the world of good and evil but in the real world.I can guarantee that at some point you have heard the iconic soundtrack to this movie in some ad or cowboy themed shoot out. It's great at the start of the film and really introduces the sense of violence and grit that the film is trying to convey. I love how ""No Name"" gets his own musical thumbprint on the film. Whenever he comes on the screen there is a little tuneful whistle that follows him all through the movie.I think ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is a masterpiece in storytelling and cinematography, whilst it does suffer a bit from old age it has stood the test of time. I recommend you to see this film and judge for yourself.",A Fistful of Dollars
217,trickrider,Why is it a western when...,8,7 December 2003,"I found it odd that ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""The Good, Bad and the Ugly"" are called westerns. If they are westerns meaning they take place in the southwestern part of the USA, then why do the main characters have Italian names? Do you know of any Italian families or influence in the old Southwest? I don't! Would not that area be more Mexican? I hear mariachi style music but I also see italians made up to look like mexicans! It's almost like Italy has a wild west! And one other point another poster made here was that Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone did not speak each others language. That Clint ignored most of the dialouge written for him in the script and wanted to keep it simple and let his acting reveal hispersonality. It's obvious that this led to his trademark screen persona as a guy who said little but definetley got respect from everyone around him! It was borne here out of his relationship with Sergio and he has replayed that original 'man with no name"" in every character from Dirty Harry to the tough guy in ""Every Which Way but Loose"" and so on",A Fistful of Dollars

At the moment I didn't know it was a remake of Yojimbo by Akira Kurosawa. By a quirky coincidence I saw the latter movie only a day later and must say: To call ""For a Fistfull of Dollars"" a remake is almost an understatement. It's a ripoff.The story is a total clone (OK, this is to be expected with a remake). The sets and camera angles are nearly identical, and even the jokes are stolen. After this experience my appreciation of the western sharply dropped. This is too early to be a homage (only 3 years later) and too uninspired for a remake. Had the story and dialog been original I might have forgiven this movie it's small other failings (soundtrack, bad acting by everyone except Eastwood - and he's not really up to his usual standards here, either). But the way it is, there is really nothing to recommend the clone over the original.Still, the original is brilliant. Detracting from that all I have said doesn't make ""For a Fistfull of Dollars"" a bad movie - merely a mediocre one.My advice: If you have the choice, go check out Yojimbo instead.5/10",A Fistful of Dollars

Leone is an asshole for claiming the story as his Idea and did not acknowledge the blunt fact he ripped off Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo without publicly apologizing.You know Kurosawa sued Leone, it never end up in court.

Clint Eastwood gives a squinted stare that could be traceable to a million of his movies, but it's still hugely fun and exciting. His character manages to swindle money out of the bad guys while simultaneously saving the small people who couldn't liberate themselves.

227,kulabas,John Wayne in Tarantino way,10,27 December 2003,"A brilliant masterpiece; Leone created a genre of cinema that nobody can do the same<remember;Sam Raimi tried.>.You have to write a clever script that also includes adventure,good dialogs and of course a little bit of sarcasism.I like to see it as a John Wayne movie in Tarantino way. 'A Fistful of Dollars' is probably a movie to remember.Not only for spaghetti western,it's also a peak point for the century of our cinema time.'JOE' is one of the first anti-hero character of movie history.Because of this I think it is a root for the film-noir genre of the latest times. From the strange start, to the funny end we don't really find out that if it is all about money, or woman or maybe fun.But if we look at the end, does our hero have a lot of money?No,but a lot of scars.So this makes the movie the most 'anti-dollar' movie in dollar triology of Leone.But this don't prevent that we're face to face with one of the best movie ever. 'JOE' is a classic Leone character.We don't know much about his past and he lives a thousands of trouble during the movie.But we all watch these like it is a part of his life.We don't become surfeited with that situation.Also like every Leone character.everything he does is planned.He makes no mistakes.Just because of the intelligence of the enemy or a coincidence,he gets caught.Of course we can't forget Clint Eastwood.He doesn't kill the character for his name but after the movie we all know that the only one to play this role is him. The second character of the movie is of course music.The Morricone's work is first class <like it always was>.From a moment you come to a level that you don't need dialogs to learn emotions,thoughts....The music starts to talk and makes the atmosphere all ready.So this gives Leone the chance to create a scene that only a few director in movie business can do:Creating the tension without the words.Remember how he did it on the final duel scene in 'The Good,The Bad,and The Ugly' and the final gunfight in 'For A Few Dollars More'.He doesn't betray the tradition and he builds a scene that we will see in the future<Back To The Future 3>But the difference between this scene and other scenes is:On other scenes there is the speed of the hands of the characters,in this one Leone shows us that you also have to be smart when it comes the time to shoot,not only on cheating,running away,or following a trail. My final word is that here is classic.It includes all the style and genre Leone wanted to do in westerns.You can say the characters or the music is like other Leone movies but small roles make this movie impossible to put it to the same level with other stuff of Leone.Really characters like 'BARMEN' and 'COFFIN MAKER' are also the things that other 2 'dollar-movies' don't have.I'm sure that we all agree with 'The Good,The Bad, and The Ugly' and 'For Few Dollars More' are the greatests, but this one is standing on the top alone.It's the biggest chance to see what all Leone western is about and also to thank for all the influence on Coppola,Robert Rodriguez,Tarantino... <One last thing:You 'LAST MAN STANDING';you're just to realize how impossible to copy the Leone style.>",A Fistful of Dollars

Classic Spaghetti Western!!,8,10 September 2012,"A Fistful of Dollars (1964) It's pretty hard to believe that, being the movie fanatic that I am, it took me 19+ years to see my first Clint Eastwood film. And after seeing this, all I'm left with is, wow - Clint Eastwood is a badass.Eastwood plays the ""Man With No Name,"" a super cool tough-guy outlaw (who, by the way, is exceptionally good with his Colt .45) in an amazingly well-played role. Italian director Sergio Leone creates an incredibly beautiful picture with this Spaghetti Western, the first film in ""The Man With No Name's"" trilogy (alongside ""For a Few More Dollars"" and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly""). The nitty gritty western landscape provides gorgeous scenery for this classic story of two rival gangs with a lone third party caught somewhere in between.If you can get past the extremely obvious dubbs (gets annoying at times), see this movie.

Many scenes are straight out of the Japanese film, which is superior to Leone's in several aspects, including the film's pacing, direction of the action sequences, and the portrayal of The Man With No Name. Coming only three years after Yojimbo, which won two awards at the Venice Film Festival, it's odd that Leone thought he could get away with plagiarizing Kurosawa's work. Although entertaining in its own right, Leone's direction is often silly, such as his trademark milking of gun scenes with repeated close-ups meant to increase suspense but which ironically drain the scene of its desired tension. I watched the two films back-to-back, having never seen Yojimbo, and was surprised at how much more I liked the Japanese film. Even its music is better.",A Fistful of Dollars

In fact, I had also watched their reruns a few times on cable TV in recent years. From the standpoint of pure entertainment, I consider the first one, A Fistful of Dollars, as the best of the lot.

Everything about him was a mystery, except for his deadly proficiency with a gun.Clint Eastwood played the laconic, steely-gazed, squint-eyed, serape-cladded, cheroot-smoking, invariably unshaven gunfighter, who was able to blast four to five baddies with bullet holes in one single sweep of his gun. He practically redefined the notion of a true hero in the wild wild west, as often exemplified by Randolph Scott (clean-cut, good-looking, & confident), Gary Cooper (stressed out, worried look), John Wayne (tough-guy, always wise-cracking) & Robert Mitchum (nonchalant, lazy style) & the others.The plot was indescribably simple: A wandering gunfighter played out two families, the Baxters & the Rojos, against each other in a god-forsaken town, somewhere near the Mexican border, which had been torn apart by greed, pride & revenge.The cinematography was visually stunning: wind-scoured deserts, dusty landscapes, empty streets. The director, Sergio Leone, obviously knew his craft as he intertwined them with a dazzling array of massive close-ups & panoramic long-shots. He had an incredible eye for details. The close-ups were sometimes quite chilling...dusty streets, rundown houses, town-folk with expression-less faces & shabby clothes, as well as baddies with twitching faces, dripping sweat, blood-oozing wounds as they fell.The movie flowed at more or less break-neck speed & every scene was riveting & compelling, backed by a brilliant music score that combined trumpets, guitars, harmonica, bells & other sounds - never heard before - that often enliven the occasional slack in between scenes. During gun-fight scenes, the accompanying music score tended to be somewhat haunting & eerie.The movie often had a style of gritty realism & expert build-up of tension, interlaced here & there with dry humor.The climactic sequence involving an eventual but deadly confrontation between the hero & the villain (a character of real menace & sadistic cruelty, played extremely well by Gian Maria Volonte) was amazing,...definitely the best scene in the movie. The villain was inordinately obsessed with his own ability to shoot a man in the heart at any distance. That proved to be his fatal mistake as our hero had fashioned an armored steel plate as bullet proof vest.The dialog sequences throughout the movie were witty & funny. In one scene as our hero rode past the under-taker, he growled: ""Get three coffins ready!"" He then confronted some baddies in town who made fun of him & his mule. He told them: ""I don't think it's nice you're laughing. You see, my mule don't like people laughing. He gets the crazy idea you're laughing at him. Now if you apologize, like I know you're going to, I might convince him that you really didn't mean it."" When they refused, Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! On his way back to the under taker, he corrected his miscalculation: ""My mistake! Four coffins!"" I really like the characterization of our hero. At one point, he seemed amoral. In fact, he seemed downright evil & greedy, as he constantly said"" ""I don't work for cheap!"" & his gun was ready for hire at the right price. In one of the opening scenes, as he rode past a father & son who were cruelly harassed by some town baddies, he did not bother to intervene at all. Only in the very brief & defining moment of the movie, he did demonstrate some redeeming quality by rescuing a damsel in distress (played by Marianne Koch). I saw him as he truly was.He also looked ultra-cool & invincible because of his exceptionally swift draw during gun fights. There was one particular scene where he was caught by the villain & his baddies. He was kicked in the butt, groin & his face was beaten to a pulp. I really felt sorry for him. This graphically violent scene was apparently extended - & beautifully choreographed - for viewer's enjoyment. In a way, this also demonstrated the human frailty of the character, caught in a dicey situation where he should have stayed away in the first place.Prior to A Fistful of Dollars, I have watched Clint Eastwood playing the character, Rowdy Yates, in the Rawhide TV series during the mid-sixties. He did not impress me at all but his performance in A Fistful of Dollars was superb. He went on to perform well in a series of other westerns, including Hang Them High, Joe Kidd, High Plains Drifter (*), The Outlaw Josey Wales (*), Pale Rider (*) & The Unforgiven (*). Of course, he also went on to play the street-smart no-nonsense character, Inspector Harry Callahan, in Dirty Harry, Magnum Force, The Enforcer, Sudden Impact (*) & The Dead Pool in the seventies & eighties. He was also the director of these movies marked with (*). I have also watched all of these action movies.I just love to watch Clint Eastwood in action. Till this day, I always remember his famous tagline: Make My Day! To conclude my review, I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this particular action movie again & again.",A Fistful of Dollars
231,jlazbuggy,Excellent Western,9,1 July 2021,"Probably one of the best western movies ever made, and certainly the most unique for its time. Clint Eastwood is the perfect lone wanderer outperforming Toshiro Mifune in Yojimbo, and the mystery simply draws you in.",A Fistful of Dollars

233,vjeet_a,Art of killing,9,7 August 2005,"Simply saying having seen this movie my interest and appreciation in shooting men has increased considerably. Now I tend to think that it more of an art! I just loved the way killing of men by a .45 revolver of Eastwood has been shown. Quite a story with fun, sorrow, danger, risk, climax. A real drama in popular Sergio's Westerner settings. I was told that the third of the ""Dollar Trilogy"", The Good, the bad and the ugly was the best among three but I find that we probably should not compare, each movie in the trilogy has an independent and different story. I wouldn't say that ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is any lesser then the most popular of dollar trilogy i.e. ""The Good, the bad and the ugly"" it is indeed a marvelous piece of movie making. I don't really know the reasoning behind the changing name of the movie but its hardly the name of the movie that matters. If you are interested in Western genre go for these movies first.",A Fistful of Dollars
234,jscontoyannis,"""Get Three Coffins Ready...",9,17 March 2005,"Sorry, Four Coffins."" First off, I am not a fan of westerns for the most part. However, the story told here is one that can be translated to just about any genre. In fact, this story has been re-told several other times on screen (most notably Kurosawa's Samurai classic ""Yojimbo"", which actually came first and is extremely similar...even some of Leone's shots are copied to the T from this; there's also a sub-par Bruce Willis version of this, but the name escapes me). But I digress. Clint Eastwood was born to play the ""man with no name"". And while he is certainly not my favorite actor, or an actor with the greatest range, I cannot imagine anyone else in this role. His squinting, grimacing, reluctant hero ushered in a new era in westerns, one which was initially ridiculed but has become a standard of sort over time. One need look no further than the fact that the phrase ""Spaghetti Western"", when first coined, was considered a derogatory term, but no longer implies that connotation; if anything, quite the opposite.The basic plot involves our protagonist (Eastwood) wandering through the desert. He happens upon a miserable little town on the Texas-Mexico border which is overrun by two factions of thieves; a group of rum runners, and a group of gun runners. Although he is warned against it, Eastwood (at one point referred to as ""Joe"" by a townsman) decides to stay in town and rack up some coin by being hired as an enforcer for both sides, thereby playing the two groups of brigands off on each other while slowly whittling down their numbers.The story is great; while no-name is not really a ""good guy"" at all, he still does good deeds, even if they do end up serving his own ends. He helps a Marisol, a woman forced to live in captivity with the head antagonist away from her husband and child, and her family escape from town; however this is done partially so that he can blame the escape and massacre of her guardsmen on the other faction of crooks so as to incite trouble. On the flip side, the villains are utter scum; totally reprehensible creatures without an ounce of good will among them. You don't feel any remorse for these characters when no-name finally takes them out.The action scenes are very well done, considering the movie was shot in 1964; there are some particularly gruesome deaths, as well as a pretty serious beating of which no-name is the recipient, along with the standard ""bang-bang-bang-bang-bang"" scenes, where 5 guys fall dead before they can even draw their guns against no-name. The music fits perfectly, and you'll notice the similarity of the music in FFOD's final scene to the music used in the climactic scene of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", Tarantino's nod to the genre.Plenty of memorable dialog, considering how minimalist the script is, and all in all a great watch that moves along quickly. It can be watched over and over. See this movie, it's a real treat even if you are not a Western fan. If you like it, you should watch the rest of the Eastwood-Leone collaborations in their loose trilogy: ""For a Few Dollars More"", and ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"".",A Fistful of Dollars
235,gluttony14,A very good movie,8,19 January 2006,"This sure is quite a movie.I had seen ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" prior to this one, and so I was expecting something quite similar. This movie is definitely no GBU, but it is a good film nonetheless.The Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood) arrives at a small town that is ruled by two rivaling families, one dealing in liquor, the other dealing in arms. After a not-so-pleasant encounter with one family, the Man With no Name buys some food and hires a room at a cantina. To pay the cantina owner what he owes him, he decides to work for the Rojos, the family that has the upper hand. And he demonstrates his skills by killing four members of the rival family, the Baxters. What follows is a movie where the Man With No Name plays both families in a plot that involves gold stolen from the government.This movie was shot with a low budget, and it shows, but it doesn't prevent the gunfights from being fast and exciting. It's always a pleasure to see the Man With No Name draw his pistol with blinding speed and take out three to four men at once. And the climax is amazing. It isn't quite on the same level as the unbelievable climax of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", but it's definitely the best scene in ""A Fistful of Dollars"". This sure is a showdown at high noon.And last but not least, I must say something about the atmosphere this film creates. Every person in town feels like a dirty peasant, working all day in the scorching heat. Every outlaw looks like an outlaw. The Man With No Name is both cool and menacing. And the cinematography in this film is spectacular.Anoyone who enjoys movies must watch this one.",A Fistful of Dollars
236,chaosHD,Where it all began,7,14 July 2008,"Not only did this film rejuvenate the western genre, but it was highly influential on film-making in general. Keep in mind that this was shot in 1964, yet wasn't released in the U.S. until January 1967, which makes it all the more ahead of it's time. The plot is actually a fairly generic western plot, but Leone adds his own touches to the formula. And it was these touches, the unique Ennio Morricone music, the closeups of heads and eyes, etc. Oh, and the hiring of some American TV actor named Clint Eastwood turned out to be brilliant as well. Leone pictured names like Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson or James Coburn in the role, but Fonda and Bronson had no interest in traveling to Spain to do a western with some no name Italian director, and Coburn asked for too much money. After the success of the Eastwood trilogy, they all regretted their decisions. Fonda and Bronson would then be more than happy to do Once Upon a Time in the West, and Coburn with Duck, You Sucker.Eastwood however, thought it would be neat to go to Spain and film a movie since he'd never been there before. He brought along some of his wardrobe and props from his show Rawhide. The last thing he expected was to become a huge star over night from some Italian western that surely hardly anybody would see.To be honest, when watched today, ""Fistful"" comes off as fairly average, with only Eastwood's performance still holding up the best. The scene toward the beginning when he squares off with the men who ""insulted"" his horse represents the first classic Eastwood moment. The villains are adequate but nothing more. The music is too repetitive. Morricone would reach new heights with his subsequent efforts. But nevertheless, it's as essential as it gets when it comes to the western genre. When amassing a western DVD collection, Sergio Leone's westerns should be the very first titles on the checklist. Every other western is secondary.",A Fistful of Dollars

But don't expect the story line to be realistic and just take it with a grain of salt. For example, Joe (Eastwood) takes the corpses of two Mexican soldiers and positions them leaning against a tombstone. The Baxter and Rojo families then converge on the cemetery -- one to ""capture"" them and the other to ""kill"" them before they can be captured. In the ensuing gunfight, the two supposedly ""alive"" soldiers never move and duck for cover. The Rojo family rejoices when they are ""killed"". Really? No one notices they never moved when the shooting started? Other things to add to the list: a hundred Mexican soldiers killed with a machine gun and no bullet holes or blood. Only one dead horse. Many more killed during the rest of movie with nary one bullet hole. Marisol punched in the face by Joe but she suffers no bruises or remembers that he did it. The Rojo family burns down the Baxter house where they suspect Marisol might be held. Really? -- you could kill Marisol!

This could be in the form of sequels, such as Lucio Fulci's unofficial Dawn of the Dead sequel Zombi 2 (aka Zombie Flesh Eaters), or it's an outright remake such as this.This is, in essence, EXACTLY the same film as Akira Kurasawa's 'Yojimbo', just in colour, in English, set in Mexico and starring Clint Eastwood. That doesn't take anything away from what makes a Leone film special; the respect for landscape; the sweating, hulking tension; the flying bullets and near misses; the flying bullets and confimed hits and have you thinking 'this is the end', only for there to be one last blood-dripping, fury-driven revenge set-piece to come.There's something magical in the ambitious over-reaching of Italian film-makers of this era, and few had as much talent, ambition and vision as Leone.Bonafide classic, and great, great fun.",A Fistful of Dollars

243,antoniocenteno-87266,A fistful of changing cinema,10,11 March 2020,"When westerns got stale in america italian directors took on the genre as a tounge in cheek review of american westerns and this movie changued cinema forever, Truth be told, for american cinema the later The good, the bad and the ugly by the same director Sergio Leone was far more influential and was the first of his movie trilogy to be released in America, but A Fistful of Dollars was in order first and changued the way directors wanted to do westerns in europe before GBU. This movie was panned by critics at the time for been far too violent and dark for it´s time, it´s aged much better than most american westerns though and definetly mark the way movies will be made in the years to come defining Sergio Leone carrer as a director, Clint Eastwood first and iconic movie role, Ennio Morricone music for this genre and putting the Spaggethi western on the map, spaning several look alikes. This movie is also an unofficial remake of Yojimbo by Akira Kurosawa who actually fined Leone, both of them settled it on court for 15% of the earnings of the movie.The acting in this movie is good and in some ocations really great due to Sergio´s direction and classic close ups wich sometimes let the faces of the actors express far too more than words could even do for the movie, there´s some shots in the final act of the movie that really let you see what is going through the mind of the charachter, specially a very intense close up to Eastwood face that make you belive he is comming out of hell to eat your soul. Eastwood, by the way, proved how much of a power star he could be for movies like this one, this perfomance as the Man with no name (nicknamed in this movie Joe) is more heartwarming, yes he is as cool gunslinger, but also has some charisma and you see him doing stuff he rarely does in other movies like eating, drinking, cheking out a women, was a far cry from american heroes but he was no near as cold blooded as he apperead in the other movies from the trilogy, yet he marked the way for anti heroes to come and is still present today.The cinematogrpahy in this movie is good, really let you take a darker and more realistic look won the west, presenting it as a place of poverty and desperation, some really long shots and everything on the screen when we get to the main place for the movie, wich was the town between rojos and baxters, with the rest in the middle and how the charachters interact within eachother in it is beautiful.Morricone score was really good here, altough he keep getting better with every movie he made with Leone, still this was his breakthrough movie in wich he really put a score that put you in the place of the action.The movie is not perfect though, many times the dubbing in this type of movie has been under the eye of critics and in this movie was an issue, altough wasn´t that bad sometimes is a bit disctracting. However my main problem with it is the poor editing in the shots that take place at night, when the charachters are around a house or a keep you see the night as we look at it in real life, however when they take on horses and ride through the plains at night is obvious that they shoted the scene at day and later downgraded the color to make it look as if it takes place at night and it looks bad, at one moment you have pitch black night, then you have this afternoon like enviroment, then pitch black again, it was weird, lightning was not the strenght of this movie.That aside this is as classic as other Leone´s movies, altough he did improved much more his formula in the movie to follow, still everything started here and this is a must watch movie, a really good western an a game chaning movie that inspired countless copies, changued westerns and movies forever, there´s countless scenes that Leone, Eastwood, Corbucci and several other re used from this one.One last advice: If you ever watch the other Leone´s westerns, not including duck you sucker, you should start for this very first one as you will find the other movies where muh bigger improvements and you might feel a bit let down when you find that this movie ain´t as good as it´s followers, again is a really good movie, but For a few more dollars is even better and GBU and Once upon a time in the west are by far some of the greatest movies ever made.",A Fistful of Dollars

245,oliverz-91768,A Fistful of Dollars - 4/5,8,29 September 2020,"Fistful of Dollars is a fast-paced Spaghetti Western with excellent action, a riveting score, and a jaded yet vulnerable character. The film stars Clint Eastwood as the iconic Man with No Name.Fistful of Dollars gets a slight edge over The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. I like Fistful a bit more because of its quick pacing. A lot happens in an hour and forty minutes, but it never feels too disorienting or overstuffed. The film is energetic and never lets down, yet really does a great job of never dealing pacing whiplash. The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly often feels slow, with the first hour setting up Eastwood's character in that film. Fistful of Dollars allows you to get familiar with the environment and the character in its opening scene, allowing it to be more efficient and fast-paced than its sequel. If you don't like The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, than consider watching Fistful of Dollars.Part of its memorable pacing is its excellent and well-rounded score. As with all Morricone scores, Fistful of Dollars provides riveting and fast-paced instrumental music. An example is its main theme that blares whenever the action gets heavy. The score allows for the film to maintain its energy while still being a fun Morricone score.Of course no Western film would be great without a cowboy. In Fistful of Dollars, our protagonist is Clint Eastwood's iconic Man With no Name. Once again, The Man with No Name is a stoic and brutal, yet charismatic character. Eastwood plays the character perfectly, given The Man with No Name a rugged and hardened charm. One great moment is the three-way Mexican Standoff between The Man with the No Name and members of the Rojo Gang. Eastwood gives The Man with No Name a cunning yet cold feeling. This allows the viewer to really feel the tension of the scene, as we do not really know what will happen next. We do know that Eastwood's character knows what he is doing, so we have anticipation for the scene but also a trust that the Man with No Name will barely make it out alive.Additionally, The Man with No Name is a physically vulnerable character. He gets beaten up near the end of the second act, but he eventually comes out back on top. We root for the character because he is able to overcome hardships, something a lot of movies with a ""cool"" protagonist forget to do. The Man with No Name is celebrated for his cunning and hardness, yet we know he can still get hurt and come back up. Eastwood's character is truly among the great cinema icons.A Fistful of Dollars is one of the greatest Western films of all time. Through it's high energy pacing, magnificent gunfights, and legendary protagonist, Sergio Leone created the blueprint for all Western films.",A Fistful of Dollars
246,JMitnik,A start of something beautiful,7,20 July 2011,"A Fistful of Dollars can be seen as the first in the so-called ""Dollars trilogy"". Even though it is the first of the three Sergio-Eastwood movies, it certainly is not on the same level as the other two.Let me start by saying that the main actor, Eastwood, was perfect. As always, The Man With No Name(ironically actually has a name, Joe) is one mysterious visitor, and tends to stir up his surroundings. I enjoyed the ""birth"" of the character, by watching him actually undergo a change, that would not only change his view towards others, but also change the view towards him. Also, the actors playing the bar-guy and the coffin guy both deserve some kudos. The coffin guy, Piripero, actually made you believe he was a bit strange in the head(maybe something to do with his age) but still very loyal, while Salvanito was generally likable. This could not be said about the other players in town, as Ramon was too much of a rough man, while Baxter was a man who thought too much of himself. That being said, I like to point out that both leaders of the two opposing factions were played extremely well. However, their minions and their prisoners(I only mean the Rojos prisoner) were acted out very poorly, and were very obviously evil.While the acting was solid most of the time, the audio itself was amazing. Not only was the soundtrack extremely epic, but also the voice-acting. Clint spoke with a soft, but fearing voice, while Salvanito had a humorous thing to his speech. I loved the timing of the songs, which were played during those 'HELL YES' moments, and could also increase the tension by a lot.The story itself was kinda strange at the beginning, but became more clear during the middle to end part. While the motives of many characters were kinda questionable, I enjoyed the friendship that was formed between Joe and Salvanito. I loved the kinda sweet moments between Piripero and Joe. But mostly of all, I was actually touched during the moment where two family members were reunited for only a second, but was taken away. These small things made the movie nice to watch, but couldn't fix the main problem this movie was suffering from; the main plot just wasn't interesting enough. Sure, watching Eastwood play two factions against each other was enjoyable, but after a while, it sorta started to drag on. Only near the end, it happens that the movie becomes somewhat epic, and opens the door for the next two installments.So here are the pros:-Great acting by the ""good guys"".-Audio was great. -The interaction between the ""good guys"" was nice to watch. -Some very heart-wrecking moments.-Atmosphere was very believing.Cons: -Not so great acting by the ""bad guys"".-Story could drag on.-Death scenes were extremely fake.With all this in consideration, I give this movie a 7 out of 10.",A Fistful of Dollars

However, Sergio Leone adds his own spin to the film. The casting is absolutely brilliant, the camera work is quite impressive, and the dialogue is some of the most memorable out of any western I have seen.I cannot stop praising Clint Eastwood's ""Joe"", whose cool demeanor yet often violent behavior makes you question whether you are following a hero. However, Joe is a man whose actions speak louder than words. Sure, he may wish to have payment for his deeds. Yet he brings justice to the middle of nowhere like some living legend of the West. He feels larger than life, but also strangely grounded. He can get hurt, but he always overcomes. He is all you could ask for in an action hero.The villains in this film are cool too. I was afraid the banditos would be very stereotypical on the first view, especially their dress. But they are well-written and some of the cruelest villains I have seen in film. The climax is satisfying with how Ramon is defeated in his own pride.As for the camera work: the ""night time"" scenes are odd, but otherwise the wide shots, the angles, and lighting are well used in this movie. Leone had a creative eye.What really sells this movie the springy, yet unnerving soundtrack that reaches into it. The beat of the song sounds like a galloping horse under a whip. It tells a legend in itself, with the growing triumphant melody. It adds to the atmosphere of the west.The only flaws I have with the film: The weird night-time darkening out in the cemetery. It has a very slow start. (Though, that builds up later.) Sometimes the action scenes are hard to follow and become too stylized over substance.Still a favorite of mine.

255,metal360,The start of a new era in film-making,8,17 March 2009,"This film is by no means the best in the series, which is more of a compliment to the filmmaker than anything. Unlike most movie franchises where each sequel gets worse and worse, each sequel in the Dollars trilogy got better and better.While ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is by no means the epic masterpiece of the later installment ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" it is still very fine and innovative work. Gone is the traditional story of the good cowboy versus the bad cowboy and in is a dark and gritty look at hatred and greed and the uncomplicated men who settled the United States. The Man With No Name shoots first and asks questions later. He doesn't look for a peaceful solution, he just shoots anyone in his way. It was not only this new type of character whom made this film so fascinated but Sergio Leone's camera-work and a bizarre score by Ennio Morricone. However, if you really don't care about all that technical junk but just want a good action film, then there is plenty of that. Bloody at times, gritty, dark, and fun. If you don't mind a few technical goofs and surrealism, then your in for a treat.",A Fistful of Dollars

As you can guess, they are rivals.As soon as he gets an idea about the town's history from the barman, he doesn't lose any minute and immediately hatches a brilliant scheme to make himself rich and clean the town of its scum.The beauty of this film is such that it overrides all its logical goofs (In the climax, no one can be sure that shooting will be done by Ramon himself, that too, to his heart  or the entire Baxter family comes through the front door to get themselves killed  or Clint Eastwood not making an attempt to take the gun of Chico when he gets killed in the vine cellar- or the fight at the cemetery with obviously dead (or deaf?) soldiers sitting in the middle)in the film.

257,ra-kamal,The king of the spaghetti western subgenre of western feature films,9,30 September 2014,"The king of the spaghetti westerns, though not the first. The credit for first spaghetti western can be claimed by Sheriff of Fractured Jaw (1958), a western comedy filmed in Spain. A Fistful of Dollars took western movie audiences by storm and catapulted spaghetti westerns onto the international scene as a serious and recognized western subgenre contender. Dozens of spaghetti westerns followed A Fistful of Dollars trying to capitalize on an emerging fascination with this subgenre. Spaghetti westerns, a subgenre of western feature films, were movies produced and filmed in Europe particularly in Italy, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom. One of the main characteristics of spaghetti westerns is a hero with unrealistic super gun skills. In a gunfight in an early scene of A Fistful of Dollars, Clint Eastwood shoots dead four villains spread apart by fifteen yards, in under two seconds. Throw in two additional ingredients: back and forth close-up facial shots and unique soundtrack music in the anteceding buildup to the spaghetti western gunfights; and we have scenes that audiences took in with delightful relish. The music was commonly variations of unusual mixtures of sounds including horse clip-clop beats, the snaps of whips, weary harmonica trills; not sparing timely introductions of trumpet sounds, guitar acoustics, cymbals, trombones, flutes, violins, piano and human Ahhs. One internet reviewer writing under the name, Jack Rabid, described the effect of the A Fistful of Dollars soundtrack as: ""...It's all pretty prairie, rolling hills, grasslands and cattle, wagon wheels, and unshaven men with uncertain life spans. It's so mood- setting, you expect to see cactus or bison outside your door instead of an asphalt city. It's instrumental music that's a veritable co-star in a motion picture, not a pack of pre-recorded hit songs all wedged into a film like large square pegs into tiny round holes. This is authentic film scoring, and it is as alluring and inviting as Leone's movie itself. You can see it just to hear this."" Spaghetti westerns typically included European directors, crews and actors and one or two fading or rising American actors. Hundreds of spaghetti westerns were produced between 1960-1980, but the popularity of spaghetti westerns was on the wane by the early 1970s. Spaghetti westerns were a passing subgenre fad much like the disco music subgenre of rock and roll. A Fistful of Dollars, a box office success, became the model that was copied over and over again as in releases like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), For a Few Dollars More (1965), Django (1966), and many others.The emergence of spaghetti westerns in the mid 1960s was considered by some critics as a farcical response to the western movie genre. But, unlike the first known spaghetti western, Sheriff of Fractured Jaw, which was meant to be a comedy, most other spaghetti westerns, including A Fistful of Dollars, were not comedies. In fact they were rife with killings, bloody fistfights, torture scenes, doses of raunchiness and naturally, mind-blowing gunfights.",A Fistful of Dollars
258,lukapapp,Great,7,16 March 2020,"Pretty fun, entertaining movie. Interesting plot with 2 families in war and ""Joe"" trying to outsmart them. Great music from legend himself Ennio Moricone. Give this movie a chance if you like good Italian western.",A Fistful of Dollars

By the way I am 18 years old and had the box set bought to me as a present from a very close friend of mine and man did I enjoy it.

262,ezytim,Superb,8,6 November 2007,"I saw this film at a sleepover (how exciting) when I was very young and only watched it recently with a critical eye. Since my first and latest viewing, I have heard countless people praise it but also several who found it very forgettable. Troubling for me was that those who thought it was excellent couldn't tell me why whilst those who objected to it stated concise and articulated reason: some questionable dubbing / syncing and a potential hole in the storyline.I have decided that I think it is, in fact, excellent. Clint couldn't play his role any better as the cunning, hard-faced protagonist; admittedly he doesn't say much, but it's not his dialogue that makes this role so brilliant. Whilst I remained fairly disconnected from all of the characters I think that added to the bleak portrayal of a lawless town where people were killed on a daily basis.As for a plot hole (and without shouting ""spoiler alert!""), I can't see it myself. There are a couple of instances of out-of-sync dubbing and if it were present in a film released tomorrow, it would get slated. However, indulge me if you will while a make a slightly tenuous analogy: the first electric motor. The first electric motor, compared to today's standards and technology would be inefficient and relatively under-powered. However, it is an invention of mind-boggling importance and surely the first production of which was a work of sheer genius. This film is the same.I loved the plot twists. I loved the way Joe lays out a seemingly random series of events only for us to later discover how his cunning has brought all the fragments together and realise his plan. I loved the camera work, particularly the quick cuts from face to face that would succinctly sum up the evil in a gang's mindset. And of course, there is the score. It is instantly recognisable and drags you into the Mexican world whether you like it or not! It is a good movie. Watch it.",A Fistful of Dollars
263,fotisgiarentis,The resurrection of spaghetti western,8,24 December 2020,"A Fist Full Of Dollars is the first movie of leone as a director , and with a rejected story from a lot of directors and with a small budget he made an all time classic.
First of all the optical aspects of the movie are amazing , with revolutionary close ups , long takes and long shots , attention to detail , amazing almost poetic cinematography , the movie can still be a good spagetti western without any sound .
But the other thing that makes this movie a classic is obviously the score of morricone.It just fits perfect in the movie and it raised the bar for other westerns to come .It can become sad , actionlike,or intense in a matter of seconds and you will not forget it easily .
Then of course except of leones apperance it was the birth of another star of hollywood clint eastwood who played the iconic character of the man with no name .He was perfect for this role , he was laconic ,he didnt have to talk to understand him because he was very expressive and he just stole the show and made the character an all time classic from the start of the movie (which by the way has great character introductions).But of course the rest of the cast had good perfemances too especially from the ""bad guys"" of the film that were easily unlikable.
But of course the movie has some issues , with some weak plotpoints and clumsy moments , and scenes that where rather funny than serious but still its normal for a small budget spagetti western movie back in the 60s .
In the end fist full of dollars is a fun movie to watch and an importand one . It resurrected the genre and it was the first movie of one of the best and most importand trilogys in cinema.",A Fistful of Dollars

Though a bit dated and very funny in places, some of it is tongue in cheek of course. I do have a problem with the dub - the lip - sync is terrible, and I personally prefer to watch anything in the original dub, but I suppose this has become a part of these films. Although this was an UNOFFICIAL remake of Kurosawa's Yojimbo (I usually condemn remakes, especially American ones, of which there are many, especially nowadays), but as I believe Kurosawa said, ""it's a fine film, but it's my film."" It is a good film in its own right, and deserves to be.",A Fistful of Dollars
267,sonickid,"Excellent setting, great story, TERRIBLE dubbing.",6,25 January 2013,"While definitely not a bad film, in my humble opinion, it is very much overrated. First off, I will admit that I do not watch many films in the Western genre, but I've seen many classics, most of which I greatly enjoyed (Unforgiven, Pale Rider, High Noon, The Searchers, etc.); this film on the other hand, seemed to pale in comparison (no pun intended).To start with, I did enjoy the story. The influence of Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"" being weaved into a Western tale is interesting immediately, & it was definitely well written into a simple but intriguing story. A mysterious stranger rides into a terribly corrupt & violent border town, & then this anti-hero proceeds to manipulate two rival factions against each other; the stranger's strength (as emphasized by one of the villains), is not simply his ability with a firearm but his intelligence, of which he makes great use. After successfully cleaning up the town, the mysterious stranger returns to the desert wilderness from where he came. As I said, a simple but well-crafted story.Even though the story was good in my opinion, the dialog was a bit lacking in points. I do realize this is an Italian ""Spaghetti Western,"" & thus the script might not have been originally written in English; this fact does carry over to the dialog in a negative fashion; at some points, it's fine but at others it's pretty bad. Going along with the dialog, I found the music to be odd & out of place at many points.The real weakness of this film was the voice acting. The movie was apparently originally filmed silently with the voices being overdubbed later. According to to the special features, ""the Spanish Actors spoke (mouthed) their lines in Spanish, the Germans spoke (mouthed) theirs in German, the Italians in Italian, and the Americans in English."" This fact most definitely shows in the final product. The dubbing is absolutely terrible; for me it was impossible to ignore the awful dubbing & it completely ruined the atmosphere of this film. The voices used to overdub the international cast were at best out of place & at worst just plain annoying; either way, they didn't seem to fit the characters or their original actors at all, really detracting from the film's quality.This film is supposed to have a very serious, very gritty, Western atmosphere; its setting absolutely created that brilliantly combined with a great story, but the atmosphere is completely destroyed by the terrible dubbing. What could have been great, ends up being just 'okay.'My rating: 6.5/10",A Fistful of Dollars

Not only have many movies been indirectly influenced by this style of filmmaking, but even such films as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels have direct references to the music, mood, and camera angles of Leone's genius.

273,Heisenberg-G1,An excellent western film. Clint Eastwood is AWESOME.,10,30 August 2009,"Being a remake of the 1961 Japanese film, Yojimbo; this is regarded to be the weakest of the bunch in the trilogy. But it is still regarded as a classic. And it was the start of something new and creative. Spaghetti Westerns. A Fistful of Dollars starts off with a a gunslinger arriving at a small Mexican border town named San Miguel. We are introduced to the Man With No Name. The main character in the film. The Man With No Name, or in the film, refereed to as Joe, is quickly introduced to mafioso style families who are laying claim to the town. One is the family of town sheriff John Baxter who are trying to protect the citizens from the cruel and gruesome brutality of the Rojo Brothers, the other family. Consisting of Don Miguel Esteban, and Ramon the main antagonist of the film brilliantly played by Gian Maria Volontè, who would go on to play another villain in For a Few Dollars More.The Man with No Name is very clever and calm. He is also a man you do not want to mess with. He is played by Clint Eastwood. Clint is fantastic as usual, and creates the coolest bad ass ever here. And one of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema. Clint went on to play the same role, The Man with No Name, in the two following prequels of the film. Gian Maria Volontè displays a brilliant villain, Ramon. He could not have been any better. And he really lets his character come to life.While this may not be considered Leone's best achievement but you cannot deny the impact this film brought to the world of westerns and the art of cinema.This film also marks the first brilliant soundtrack provided by the brilliant and talented Ennio Morricone who would go on to provide the brilliant soundtracks for the next two films in the trilogy and the new Quentin Tarantino film Inglourious Basterds. I am a sucker for westerns, more so spaghetti westerns, not only because of the story but because of the atmosphere and cinematography. The way that Leone captures all of the surroundings is just amazing.And we are also introduced to Leone's signature style in the film. Close ups. This film certainly revolutionized the genre of westerns and oh man they were plenty more alike to follow. The ending scene is so full of tension and suspense that you will be cringing on the edge of your seat. This is also the same for For A Few Dollars More and The Good The Bad and The Ugly. Full of suspense, humor, tension, violence, and anger this film is and always will be timeless. It can be enjoyed and be fun to watch any day. This is without a doubt overlooked and underrated not receiving as much praise and recognition as it should. But all I can do is give you the same advice I was given. And that advice is what I hope you will also follow. I took the advice to go and see the film and the outcome was overwhelming.",A Fistful of Dollars
274,purpletina,Why 6/10?,6,28 November 2013,"It is such a rip off. If you have watched Yojinbo, you might notice it. If you haven't,I'll explain it, in parenthesis you can find the Yojinbo counter-part. Stranger walks into town (samurai), the town is dominated by two clans (one owns a bar, the other a brothel), the stranger goes into a place to eat and drink and can't pay (owned by an old man that has a coffin-maker as a neighbour), the stranger agrees to become a hired gun/sword (kills some of the bar owners' men and shows of his talent) so that he becomes employed by the other side (the brothel owners). The clan (brothel owners) consider that why pay the guy so much money, when they could kill him and get the money back (in Yojinbo they do kind of try pulling that off). The stranger starts playing for both sides for money. Marisol (some woman with a moron for a husband) is traded from one clan to the other for the son (mom slaps the son in both versions once the exchange is made), Marisol's husband lost everything gambling (surprise, so did Yojinbo's counterpart)...and this could keep going.So, while I can appreciate the change of scenery, Japan vs. the wild west, truth is, this is the same story with somewhat of a twist. And there's nothing wrong about re-making a movie, or re-telling a story, but when you do so without saying that it has been influenced, inspired by this other movie (somewhat obscure and old), I call it rip off.",A Fistful of Dollars

He then strangles Belle Starr for three days, then tries to revive her. (It didn't work) Clint Eastwood then kills three members of the Baxter's then tells the coffin maker ""My mistake four coffins"" almost forgetting Belle Star's corpse lying out towards the town entrance. Clint then proceeds to screw over both the Baxter's and the Rojo's for his own personal gain. The ending of this movie was great Clint Eastwood is getting shot at by Ramon Rojo in the final duel and then stands out in front of Romon and says ""hold on to something. here comes the rain, this damn is about to break"" after a long pause Roman not buying into what Clint Eastwood is saying shoots him in the face killing him instantly like an idiot.

But in this film along with For a Few Dollars More-establishes the character and also seems to have more realism than GBU. They seem lonelier, and show more of the emptiness that is in the West. I don't think the extremely low budget hurts the film. Leone made a masterpiece with what he had. Yes, the script is not the greatest, and it is basically ripping off Kursowa's Yojimbo. But still Leone makes a film that captures one's attention-this is not your average Western! I remember first seeing this film when I was 8, and being totally entranced-more than Star Wars!

And even in the 1960s people must have realized that if the front of one's house is on fire and under gunfire, you go out the back. And do grownup man really continuously giggle when they execute unarmed people?

281,Frogleggs4,Fistful of Dollars,10,3 September 2007,"A classic innovative film that changed the face of the Western.Sergio Leone's 1964 film made Clint Eastwood an international star.This new genre of Western was called ""the spaghetti western"", a term that I personally don't like. It seems to imply a negative meaning as though a Western directed by a foreigner is inferior to American made films. Most American westerns depicted a glamorous, sanitized view of life filmed on elaborate stages. Leone's Fistful explodes that myth with a hard edged view filmed on location. The film shows a dirty,dusty and brutal world ruled by the gun.I believe this was how the West really was and not the contrived Hollywood version.Leone introduces a unique style of filming with his facial closeups and sharp angle shots, particularly from the ground level looking up.Ennio Morricone's musical collaboration perfectly captures Leone's vision.Morricone adds to the film what proved to be staples of Leone's later films that others of the genre would imitate. Such as the haunting singing chorus,blaring trumpets,stringing guitars and harmonic whistling.Fistful reveals in Eastwood's character a flawed individual instead of the noble hero found in most Westerns during that time.He was the anti-hero who lived by his own moral code and blew away any who stood in his way.This film was the first of what would be a trilogy based on Eastwood's role as ""the man with no name"".Hard to believe that this role was first offered to Steve(Hercules)Reeves who turned it down.After seeing Eastwood performance in Fistful, I can't imagine anyone else playing the part.A great film, but I believe Leone's sequels, ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good,The Bad and The Ugly"" are better films.",A Fistful of Dollars

Maybe because I liked the movie so much, just like the Kurosawa as a director and writer this movie looked like a cheap ripoff for me. The worst part I think is that nothing new was brought and by that I mean that if you seen ""Yôjinbô"" you knew what's going to happen. But the worst part is that if you even start to compare ""Yôjinbô"" with this movie, it fades into unknown. The film simply does not have soul.

287,simfilms-1,"Film facts about ""Fistful of Dollars""",8,30 May 2005,"Eastwood made this film while on hiatus from shooting the TV series, ""Rawhide"". He was paid $15,000. The total budget was said to be less than $250,000. When he returned for the sequel ""For a Few Dollars More"", his salary had risen to $50,000 due to the European success of the first film. Rumor has it that although Eastwood spoke his lines in English in ""Fistful"", he had to loop all the lines for the English-language version. It seems that the film was never considered to be shown outside of Italy and they didn't record Eastwood since they figured to re-dub him in Italian anyway. The film was not released in the US until 1967 (a year after ""Good, Bad, & Ugly"" was finished and released in Europe). I consider this to be the best of the ""Dollars"" trilogy in spite of its minuscule budget because of its supremely dramatic music (Morricone) and the humanity of Eastwood's character, Joe, in unselfishly helping Marisol (the woman kept from her husband and child by the villain). Advertising tag-lines of the time: ""It's the first motion picture of its kind...it won't be the last."" and ""In his own way, he is perhaps the most dangerous man who ever lived.""""The Man With No Name"" was a fiction concocted by the advertising dept. In ""Fistful"", Eastwood's name is ""Joe"" In ""Few Dollars More"", his name is ""Mango"" In ""Good, Bad, Ugly"", his name is ""Blondie"".The last film ""G, B, & U"", actually seemed to be a prequel to the first two films since near the end of the movie, Eastwood finds his signature serape' in the ruins of a bombed-out church.",A Fistful of Dollars
288,abdullahakman,the movie is about just what the title tells you,10,14 May 2006,"if you like the movies that are not about who is good and who's bad. this one is just for you...of course you take a side and be probably on the handsome guy's side who can't be described as a decent citizen by any means . what's the point of being honest having morale values if you are all surrounded by people who don't now what they mean... just do what it takes to survive... actually the guy just does all what it takes to get a for a few dollars more. that's all... except for the ending where we see some acts which a decent guy would do... in my opinion this is the best movie of S.Leone's trilogy of ""a man without a name"" and it is actually underrated",A Fistful of Dollars
289,tjay-43379,Poor production,5,2 November 2017,"You really appreciate the original Kurosawa production after watching this. This is a poor production compared to Kurosawa's Yojimbo. The acting is just sub-par and amateurish. I like Eastwood as an actor but I don't know what it is but he is just misplaced in this production. He performance is just, well, sub-par. Comparing him to Mifune in Yojimbo would be an insult. You just come to further appreciate what a truly brilliant actor Mifune was after watching this. There is just no comparison in Fist Full of Dollars and the original Yojimbo production.",A Fistful of Dollars
