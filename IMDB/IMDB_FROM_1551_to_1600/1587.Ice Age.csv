0,TheLittleSongbird,A really nice surprise!,8,6 May 2009,"I think too many people compare this to Monsters' Inc and Shrek in terms of animation quality. I also think that this film would have been a lot more successful, had it not been released too soon to Monsters' Inc. I thought it was a well-written film and in some case sweet too. The animation is spot on, and when I saw it at the cinema, the whole room were in hysterics in the first five minutes, because of Scrat, who was one of the funnier characters. The voice work is highly commendable, especially Ray Romano as Manny and Denis Leary as Diego. John Leguizamo has his moments as Sid. The script was well written, very funny, but sometimes especially towards the end, when the humour could have been more focused. I actually liked the sentimentality brought into the story. The baby, is one of those characters you love or hate, I warmed to him, but i never empathised with him. Although, I was really moved by the bit where Manny is seen staring at the drawing with the hunters killing mammoths. Anyway, the music score was perfect. All in all, a funny and sometimes touching picture, that had a tendency to get a bit slow, but overall this is misjudged by people. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Ice Age
1,SnoopyStyle,Good group chemistry,7,24 November 2013,"Manfred (Ray Romano) is a mammoth who is alone in the world. Sid (John Leguizamo) is a sloth who annoys everybody and is left behind. A group of sabertooth tigers want revenge on a human tribe. They try to steal a baby but Sid and Manfred rescue him. Diego (Denis Leary) is a sabertooth tiger sent to track down the baby, but he must decide which side he's on.Sid and Manfred have a great bromance. Leguizamo is especially funny as the annoying sloth. Manfred is always bothered by Sid's antics. Diego starts off with questionable motives, but eventually the three form their own special herd.This is much more for the smaller kids. There isn't the constant modern referencing. But the animal cartoons are fun. Sid is especially funny. They are an enjoyable group and an enjoyable movie.",Ice Age
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Touch of Jungle Book and Monsters, Inc., but succeeds on its own",6,12 December 2014,"""Ice Age"" is widely considered one of the best animated feature films of the 2000s and even if it is already 12 years old now, it is still certainly worth watching. It lost the Animated Oscar to Hayao Miyazaki's ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"" and runs for only 75 minutes not counting the closing credits. It has a parallel to the very successful ""Monsters, Inc."" as the film's protagonists also spend most of the movie with carrying a little kid around that does not really belong into their world. Here it is an Eskimo baby and the saber-toothed tiger, the mammoth and the sloth go on a journey to bring it back to its parents. The voice cast is fairly unknown, no real superstars here unlike most animated films these days. The most known member may be Jack Black.Visually, it is excellent work. The animated ice world is as nice to look at as all the creatures living in there. In terms of the story, early on it is mostly fun and a kids movie, but it gets deeper towards the end with some really emotionally investing moments. One would be the mammoth seeing the cave paintings and how he reacts to them. Another would be the ending when they reach the Eskimo tribe and give back the baby. I think they chose wisely to make this the final highlight of the film and not the dramatic tiger fight which happens before. Adds a lot of heart to the movie. Apart from that, it is interesting to see how the motivations of the trio change during the journey. The sloth wants to bring the baby back from start to finish. The mammoth really only wants to get rid of the sloth early on and develops a bond with the baby as the story continues. The tiger basically takes the enemy within role and wants to trick the other two in order to feed them to his fellows, but his motivations also change quickly.Director Chris Wedge started his career with the Academy Award winning animated short film ""Bunny"" and most recently directed ""Epic"", which I enjoyed a lot. He seems to have a talent to take us into new worlds mostly including animals. There are 3 sequels to ""Ice Age"" by now, but Wedge only directed the original. He gave his voice to Scrat in the other films though. The scenes including Scrat will be especially loved by younger audiences and serve as intermissions between the main story parts. It's a pretty interesting concept, somehow like short films within a movie almost completely independent from the story. Co-director Saldanha worked also on the sequels and not too long ago on ""Rio 2"", a film also centered on animals, but in a completely different spot of the planet, especially in terms of the climate.I recommend watching ""Ice Age"". It could almost be described as a road movie from many centuries ago and that is probably pretty unique. It has lots of humor, basically from start to finish, and heart and is worth a watch also for people who are not that interested in the animation genre.",Ice Age
3,kosmasp,Evolution,8,14 September 2009,"An animated picture that is really good and it's not from Pixar? Then it must be from Walt Disney Pictures, right? Well ... no! This little movie that dared and could, comes not from the Disney House (and/or Pixar which is now part of the big Disney family), but still is a great movie.While it has a few flaws (especially pacing wise), it convinces with it's very funny characters. A great first movie, that introduces us to characters we learn to love. And you have an animal (to love) for everyone. The talented voice cast turns it up a notch and make you forget about the very pale ""humans"" (depicted in this movie).",Ice Age
4,classicsoncall,"""I don't know about you guys, but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.""",7,12 January 2014,"I'm always way behind the curve on these animated features, this one by about a dozen years. I don't know how that happens but time does go by. Maybe because I've seen so many films, I have to conclude that the story here wasn't very original or exciting, but on the plus side, young kids watching will probably get the message about teamwork, friendship, loyalty and integrity. Animation wise, I thought there was room for improvement with some of the characters but that was offset by the vivid use of color. I did get a kick out of the Tae-Kwan-Dodo bird gimmick, that was pretty funny. Overall, a passable story and recommended for the younger set, so if you have youngsters in the family, treat them by watching along side.",Ice Age
5,jboothmillard,Ice Age,5,9 September 2005,"This was the first computer-animated film to be released by 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios, and led to films like Robots, Rio, and Ferdinand. I watched it several times when I was younger, it was a box office success, so it was inevitable that a franchise of sequels would follow, directed by Chris Wedge (Robots, Monster Trucks). Basically, it opens with a sabre-toothed squirrel known as Scrat (Chris Wedge) trying to find a place to store his acorn for the winter. In doing so, he inadvertently causes a crack in the ice, setting off a large avalanche, which he barely escapes. At the same time, a herd of prehistoric animals are migrating south to escape the forthcoming ice age. While a gruff woolly mammoth named Manfred aka ""Manny"" (Ray Romano) is heading north. Sid (John Leguizamo), a clumsy ground sloth, has been left behind by his family and decides to move on by himself. He inadvertently angers two Brontotheres, Carl (voice) and Frank (Stephen Root), after ruining their meal. Manny fights the rhinos after thy try to attack and continues on his path. Sid follows him, not wanting to be alone and unprotected. Manny is annoyed by Sid's outgoing demeanour and wishes to migrate alone, nevertheless Sid continues to follow him. Meanwhile, Soto (Goran Visnjic), the leader of a Smilodon pack aka sabretooth tigers, wants revenge on a neanderthal tribe for killing half of his pack by killing the chief's infant son. Soto leads a raid on the neanderthal camp, during which the baby's mother is cornered by Soto's lieutenant, Diego (Denis Leary), until she jumps down a waterfall. Soto orders Diego to find and retrieve the baby while the rest of the pack will wait for him at the mountain known as Half-Peak. Later, Sid and Manny encounter the mother in the river. In her dying moments she rests the baby on a rock for Manny to take, before disappearing into the water. After much persuasion by Sid, they decide to return the baby, but the camp has been deserted. They meet Diego, who claims he wanted to help the child, he convinces the pair to let him help by tracking the tribe. The four travel on, with Diego secretly leading them to Half-Peak where his pack is waiting to ambush them. On the way, they must change the baby, get into a squabble for a melon for the baby with a flock of dodo birds, encounter the Brontotheres once again, and enter an ice cavern. Scrat also pops up along the way still trying to find a place to keep his beloved acorn. Following these misadventures, the group reaches a cave with several cave paintings. There, Sid and Diego learn about Manny's past and his previous interactions with neanderthal hunters; they slaughtered his family, consisting of his mate and child, leaving Manny a depressed loner. Before reaching Half-Peak, they encounter a forming river of lava. While Sid and the baby get safely across, Diego almost falls, but Manny saves him, narrowly missing death himself. The herd takes a break for the night, and the baby takes his first walking steps towards Diego, who is having a change of heart after his time with Manny and Sid. The next day, the herd approaches the mountain, but Diego changes his mind and confesses to Manny and Sid about the ambush. As the pair turn hostile towards him, Diego asks for their trust and wants to help them escape attack. The herd battles Soto's pack, and guard the baby from harm, but Soto and his associates Zeke (Jack Black) and Oscar (Diedrich Bader) manage to corner Manny. As Soto closes in for the kill on Manny, Diego sacrifices himself by jumping in the way and is injured as a result. Manny then knocks Soto into a rock wall, causing several sharp icicles to fall and impale Soto, killing him instantly. The rest of the pack retreat in fear. Manny and Sid mourn for Diego, believing his injury is fatal, and go on without him. The two manage to successfully return the baby to his tribe, the father Runar bestows a beaded necklace to Manny in thanks. As the tribe walk away, Diego reunites with Sid and Manny, and they head off to warmer climates. 20,000 years later, Scrat, frozen in a block of ice, washes up on the shores of a tropical island. The ice slowly melts, and the acorn falls out, but Scrat cannot get himself out in time to rescue it from being washed away. Scrat then finds a coconut and tries to stomp it into the ground, he ends up accidentally triggering a volcanic eruption. Also starring Alan Tudyk as Lenny / Oscar / Dab, Lorri Bagley as Jennifer, and Jane Krakowski as Rachel. The voices of Romano, Leguizamo and Leary are suited for their characters who banter well together, I agree it is not the most exciting film, but it has fun and amusing moments that will entertain kids and adults alike, it is an alright family animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Worth watching!",Ice Age
6,ccthemovieman-1,Wish All Animated Films Were This Good!,10,13 April 2006,"I'd have to say this is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago. I can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie.A gorgeous color palette (man, this looks good) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make this a big winner. The opening 3-4-minute scene with ""Scat,"" is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him. ""Sid"" the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the movie. He usually has something funny to say throughout the movie.Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tigerThis isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice, sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters. This isn't interrupted with a lot of songs, either: one only brief one and there is nothing offensive, language-wise.If more animated movies were this good, I'd own more.",Ice Age
7,Quinoa1984,One of the most enjoyable family films in the past years,7,15 March 2002,"It always seems to be with these computer animated movies, to have a charm all it's own, humor that usually works all around, and (a flaw to be sure) the same plot elements fitted into different settings (notice how friendship, betrayal and a climax involving kids in some way fit into every animated movie in the past 7 years outside of Antz).  Ice Age follows that tradition being the first 20th Century Fox computer animated movie from Bunny director Chris Wedge, and it has an undeniable sweetness that can strike young and old alike.  This also goes with the laughs too.Manfred (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), and Diego (Denis Leary) join together, obvious un-wantingly at first, to return a baby to it's father. That's the plot-line and it works in it's typical way, borrowing from the two good computer flicks from last year as well (Monster's Inc. and Shrek). But what keeps young and old and inbetween alike in their seats is not the story but rather the good natured and silly humor, convinving if not always realistic surroundings and splendid voice work by the three leads.  A fine movie.One more note: while Leary, Romano and Leguizamo show off their capabilities, I jest to forget who steals a good chunk of the movie- a little squirrel chasing after an all important acorn nut throughout the pan of the movie.  Truth be told, he deserves his own TV show. A-",Ice Age
8,michaelRokeefe,Friends come in different shapes and sizes.,7,6 August 2003,"A wonderful animated movie that deserves all the praise it garners. A simple story that comes across big and triumphant. Prehistoric animals rescue a human baby. Lending their voices to this beautiful project are: Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Diedrich Bader, Jack Black and Jan Krakowski. Don't miss the chance to see this family fare.",Ice Age
9,studioAT,The best Ice Age film by miles,5,25 July 2013,I liked Ice Age. I thought it offered a nice change to the films of Pixar (which don't get me wrong I love but everyone needs a change sometimes) and to play on the buddy comedy idea between the creatures worked well.It's a good film that works on many levels and is one that both adults and kids can enjoy. The voice talents aren't as well known to people in the UK as perhaps they are in the US with Ray Romano being the only one I knew from his great sitcom.However while I like this film I feel it could have worked much better as a stand alone film because the standard was so good and has only been cheapened by the many sequels it has now produced. Perhaps studios need to understand that not everything needs to be a franchise.,Ice Age
10,Hey_Sweden,Completely endearing.,8,1 July 2012,"The Looney Tunes spirit is kept alive and well in this likable computer animated feature, that also continues the tradition started by ""Toy Story"" in having humour for younger and older viewers. It's also got real heart and soul, and characters that are never less than entertaining. It can often bring a lump to ones' throat, just as much as it elicits chuckles with its one liners and visual gags. Set during the title time in Earths' history, it brings together three very unlikely comrades - a solitary mammoth named Manfred (voice of Ray Romano), a goof ball sloth named Sid (voice of John Leguizamo), and a sabre toothed tiger named Diego (voice of Denis Leary). Their mission is to return a human baby to its tribe, although Diegos' motive has nothing to do with wanting to do the ""right"" thing. Punctuated by the misadventures of a prehistoric squirrel named Scrat (voice of director Chris Wedge), just as terminally unlucky as Wile E. Coyote himself, ""Ice Age"" is hard to resist, right from start to finish. The characters are wittily and inventively realized visually, especially Sid, the kind of character who can be seen as annoying but who is also very likable in his way. Leguizamo is a standout in this role, getting most of the big laughs. Other talents providing voices are Goran Visnjic as Soto, and Jack Black as Zeke, as well as Cedric the Entertainer, Stephen Root, Diedrich Bader, Alan Tudyk, and Jane Krakowski. Some scenes of peril may indeed be too much for the very young to take, but for others there is a deliciously dark edge to some of the humour, especially in regards to the dodo birds. There's also a very nice message in here about looking out for others, as well as one about redemption. All in all, a fine family feature, one that charms and amuses for a well paced 81 minutes. Eight out of 10.",Ice Age
11,zardoz-13,Far-Fetched But Funny Animal Yarn,8,2 April 2011,"The computer-animated epic ""Ice Age"" musters cross-generational appeal--adolescents as well as adults--with its ""Looney Tunes"" like tale about a woolly mammoth, Manfred (Ray Romano), a dim-witted sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo of ""The Pest""), and a sagacious saber-toothed tiger, Diego (Denis Leary of ""The Amazing Spiderman"") and their exploits 20,000 years ago when glaciers moved and wildlife migrated. Director Chris Wedge and co-director Carlos Saldanha get things off to a hilarious start with a woebegone little character named ""Scrat"" as it chases an acorn without being crushed by a glacier. The desperate efforts by the varmint to save the acorn while not being killed by the ice makes this opening gambit wonderfully funny. Basically, this is a road trip comedy with an odd couple. The story unfolds rather dramatically with a pack of saber-tooth tigers plotting to wipe out a village of prehistoric humans so that they can get the morsel of a baby. Later, the helpless Sid has to elude a couple of pugnacious rhinos and Manfred intervenes to save his life from the rhinos. The saber-tooth tigers attack the village. During the battle, the mother seizes her baby and flees. Diego corners her on a high rock above a water fall and she plunges into the rapidly flowing water to save her child. Downriver she manages to get the baby safely put on land while Manfred and Sid watch. The next time that we see them, Sid observes that the mother is 'gone.' ""Ice Age"" turns into three critters and a baby. The baby grows up enough to learn how to watch. Other amusing gags include our heroes stumbling upon a tribe of dodo birds that contribute more to their own extinction by stupidity than the dangers that they face. Diego joins up with Manfred and Sid but he does so because the saber-tooth tiger leader wants him to deliver the baby alive or suffer dire consequences. We learn later on from a cave painting what may have happened to Manfred's family. ""Ice Age"" packs several surprises, and sensitive adults will shed tears at Diego's untimely demise. Sid and the acorn-chasing Scrat steal the show. The animation is particularly good, too. The end gambit with a frozen Scrat washing ashore on an island is a rib-tickling hoot.",Ice Age
12,Boba_Fett1138,Great characters in a fun adventure!,9,25 June 2004,"""Ice Age"" gives us a sabertooth tiger, a sloth, and a mammoth and lets them go on an adventure. The result is a fun and entertaining movie.The absolute greatest thing about the movie are the characters. The unlikely trio forms the base of the movie and are wonderful together, also thanks to the voice cast of course, especially the character Sid voiced by John Leguizamo is highly entertaining. Also Scrat the squirrel that pops up every now and then is funny and adorable.The animations itself are pretty poor compared to many other animated movies. Especially the humans look kind of sloppy as well as most of the backgrounds. Luckily it doesn't make the movie less watchable in any way.It's a shame that the movie becomes a bit over sentimental at times, especially at the ending. It doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the movie and feels a bit overdone. Still the undertone of the movie is mainly fun and entertaining.Great movie to watch over and over again!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Ice Age
13,anaconda-40658,Saber Tooth Cats are Carnevores by Nature.,5,22 May 2015,"Ice Age (2002): Dir: Chris Wedge / Voices: Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Jack Black, Chris Wedge: Computer animation about new things and compromise between conflicting groups. The ice age has arrived and animals are heading south but not Manfred the mammoth. He is accompanied by a sloth named Sid and they are forced to trust a saber-tooth tiger named Diago. Ray Romano voices Manfred who faces tradition yet must care for an Eskimo child. This all climaxes upon an unrealistic compromise. John Leguizamo voices the irritating Sid whose job is to provide comic relief and be a complete pain in the frozen asshole to everyone else on this journey. Denis Leary voices Diago who has a predicted change of heart as if nobody could see that coming. And as if anyone needs to point out that it is a saber-tooth cat's nature to be carnivores and not buddy up to humongous mammoths and cuddly sloths. Besides Manfred, the only character of interest is the prehistoric squirrel that is featured periodically in his hazardous quest to obtain an acorn. Director Chris Wedge is backed by decent humour, which works best, but not so much of a script. He also provides the vocals of sorts for the prehistoric squirrel Scrat that is involved in the film's best scenes. The computer generated images are bright and colourful highlighting the era involved but they are unable to thaw out weak writing. Score: 5 / 10",Ice Age
14,mm-39,Love that squirrel,8,3 May 2002,This was a great animation with lots of humor.  Denis Leary's voice is always recognizable.  This film is great for kids but also entertaining for adults.  The voices suited the characters.  This is one that I will purchase when it comes out.  I felt sorry for the doodoo birds.  A good family orientated film.  8/10,Ice Age
15,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Ice Age (2002),7,18 March 2006,"I've missed this animated movie when it was out in Singapore a few years back. Since the sequel is hitting our shores real soon, I thought I'd better get myself up to speed with the original movie, lest I miss out on some references used in the sequel. You see, must do homework mah? It has been 4 years since this movie was released, but I am marveled at the level of animation detail that was already incorporated - the ice never looked as white or as menacing, and the scenes of water in this movie, could have been the real thing. It really is that good. Which is quite surprising, considering that Ice Age was only Fox Animation Studios' attempt after their initial offering of Titan AE.The beginning of Ice Age comprised of that extra long trailer featuring Scrat (the part squirrel part rat animal) trying to bury its acorn into the ice. Yes, it's the same one, which lead directly to a scene which looked straight out of A Land Before Time. The prehistoric animals are making their way down south, but somehow, Manny the Mammoth decides to leave the herd, and head up north instead. He meets Sid the Sloth, and they begin an uneasy alliance - you know, the usual bored character meets witty-but-irritating character routine.At the same time, some sabre-tooth tigers have ambushed some early-humans (they don't speak), and their prized target, a human baby, escapes. Diego gets appointed by the pack to hunt the baby down and deliver it, so that they can exact revenge. But alas the baby gets saved rather reluctantly by Manny and Sid, and Diego has to use its cunning to infiltrate the group, and complete its mission.It's a simple movie with mature themes, infused with madcap comedy. I especially enjoyed the crazy sequence with the dumb dodo birds - after watching this, you'd think that they deserve to be extinct! But anyhow, central to the themes is that of sacrifice and friendship. It got played out really well, since you have a double agent amongst the group of unlikely friends. And it is precisely this that the sequel can be born.As with most animation flicks these days, look out for some spoofs, especially in the cave (with the UFO), and pay close attention to the dialog - lots of gems to listen out for. It's an interesting caper, and the sequel, yes I'm awaiting.This Code 1, two-discs special edition comes with features filled to the brim. The first disc contains an audio commentary, interactive games, both widescreen and fullscreen formats, and the usual audio selection and subtitles. The second discs comes with an animated short Scrat's Missing Adventure, an HBO behind the scenes special, a making-of documentary, 6 deleted scenes, 6 production featurettes, trailers, and a clip from Blue Sky Studio's Oscar winning film ""Bunny"". Whew!",Ice Age
16,SimonJack,This animal bunch entertains all ages,7,16 August 2017,"This is the first of what was to become a series of animated films with animal characters living in the ice age. Ostensibly for children, it carries a PG rating. It could be because of some of the mild violence that's shown, and some of the scary characters – notably the lions. But more than likely, it's because of the humorous dialog that at times is adult. Indeed, I think ""Ice Age"" and it's follow-up films were made more for adults than for kids. It is funny and entertaining, and I think suitable for the whole family. It's one of a small field of films that all ages will sit still for. The little tykes like the fuzzy, cute and bug-eyed animal characters. The young kids and teens will like the action and antics. And adults mostly will enjoy the dialog. This one was a big hit and the sequels continue to draw the crowds. So long as the writers can come up with new ideas for plots, Manny, Sid, Diego and a nameless crazy squirrel could be around a long time. Maybe even to the next ice age.",Ice Age
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,Very cute and fun for all ages!,8,26 July 2005,"I just recently saw a trailer for ""Ice Age 2"" and it looked absolutely funny! I was asking my best friend if she ever saw the first Ice Age and she didn't see it either. So, we made our little typical trip to Blockbuster Video and rented it. ""Ice Age"" was so adorable and fun to watch. I mean, I really enjoyed this film, it's kind of hard to enjoy the Pixar films, because I usually enjoy the old fashion animated Disney films. I still miss them, but recently I have been also leaning towards Pixar. I've seen some very cute and lovable movies: Toy Story, The Incredables, and now Ice Age. I would highly recommend this movie for the family. It's a wonderful and charming film that will take your warm breathe away. :D Cheesy, I know, I know. I'm working on it.8/10",Ice Age
18,MovieAddict2016,Not very impressive.,5,15 January 2006,"So far DreamWorks Pictures has only produced two worthwhile computer-animated films (the ""Shrek"" movies) and ""Ice Age"" is another reminder of why Pixar has them beat in almost all aspects.First of all the only good thing about this movie is the cast - Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary. The animation is terrible for the most part and it just isn't very clever, funny or witty - at least not as much as it should be.If you've seen any Pixar films you'll instantly realize why they're vastly superior to DreamWorks' animated department - comparing ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"" to ""Ice Age"" and ""Shark Tale,"" for example, proves to be a laughable comparison.Unfortunately a sequel is coming out to this quite soon and judging from the trailer it's going to be a horrendeous cash-in.",Ice Age
19,Rainey-Dawn,A Worth While Animation,8,23 October 2014,"One of the funniest animated films I have seen and yes it is worth while watching. A cute story, comical characters, great animation and an all around good comedy.I loved all the characters but I will admit it: Scrat is my favorite toon in the entire film. To me, he was the most comical with his sight gags. I've never witness such humor in hiding and eating nuts but Scrat managed to get a quite a few laughs out of me with is nutty ways.If you like animated comedies then give Ice Age a view - you are sure to get a few giggles out of this cute film.8/10",Ice Age

21,sddavis63,Exceptionally Well Done,8,14 March 2008,"Marvellous animation, a good story and fun characters all add up to make ""Ice Age"" one of the better ""kids"" movies I've seen. The story - set during the Ice Age - revolves around a giant sloth named Sid who stumbles across a human baby, and decides that the baby should be returned to its family. He enlists the reluctant help of Manfred the Woolly Mammoth, and the duo then first do battle with Diego the Sabre-Toothed Cat, who wants to capture the baby, and then, through a series of adventures, manage to turn Diego into a somewhat surprising and surprised ally.Sid is clearly the highlight of the movie. He provides most of the action and most of the fun - a giant sloth who just can't keep still or keep quiet. And yet, for all the humour Sid injects, I appreciated that there were some serious plot elements in the movie as well. The trio stumble upon some cave paintings as they seek out the baby's human family, and a painting of a mammoth family obviously makes Manfred remember his own family, who were apparently hunted down and killed by humans. This also helps to explain Manfred's rather gruff exterior, and penchant for aloofness. Diego's apparent death scene near the end of the movie also injects a dramatic feel, although, on that note, I question the decision to bring Diego back at the end of the movie. His ""death"" was a poignant moment, and made the point forcefully of what we should be willing to sacrifice for our friends. Since Disney killed off Bambi's mom, it seems that animated children's stories have wanted to avoid the reality of death. Having said that, the combination of the three (or four, if you count the human baby) points out that families come in many different shapes - ""it's what herds do"" is the repeated mantra as Sid, Manfred and Diego (as unlikely a herd as you could imagine) find themselves coming to each other's rescue over and over again as the story progresses.There's some great satirical material here: as the trio trudge southward to escape the ice, Sid reflects wistfully that some global warming would be great, and I appreciated the irony of the fact (as was pointed out by one of the characters) that, in this movie, animals could talk and humans couldn't! The portrayal of the dodo birds was also quite hilarious.All in all, this is an extremely well done family movie. 8/10",Ice Age
22,paul2001sw-1,Left me cold,3,25 March 2006,"'Toy Story' is widely acclaimed for being the first film to rely entirely on computer animation; but in fact, it also had qualities that make it quite special among animated films. The ploy about obsolesce - a thinly disguised metaphor for human death - was amazingly dark for a ""childrens'"" film. The humour - centred on a toy spaceman who thinks he's a real spaceman - was incredibly sophisticated. And the metaphysic was entirely consistent throughout: every action the toys undertook was entirely in character, which meant that an adult could stay engaged throughout it's feature length. Many computer-animated movies since then have received similar rave reviews, but they haven't possessed these special qualities - and 'Ice Age' has none of them, just a bunch of annoying comedy animals and a by-numbers, episodic plot. There are other features of this film that also seem strange: the absence of any significant female characters, for example, and the unhappy contrast between the nicely rendered central characters and the static backdrops - it's like watching an old film where (human) actors pose in front of painted cardboard. It's also very strange to make the hero a hyperactive sloth with no slothful characterises at all. The best animated films have the same qualities as the best non-animated films, but I didn't find them in this film. And if you really want to watch a film where dinosaurs and humans roam the earth simultaneously, 'One Million Years B.C.' was actually more fun",Ice Age
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Short, simple and fairly straightforward yet extremely well-executed, entertaining and surprisingly emotional.",7,2 December 2017,"It's a short, simple story with a strong structure and three somewhat stereotypical yet superbly crafted central characters, set against a unique backdrop of prehistoric permafrost that's, strangely, not often explored on film despite its interesting inhabitants and splendid scenery (not to mention the artistic licence inherent with a narrative that takes place so very long ago). The animation (and general graphic) style is rough around the edges but ultimately snappy, lively and aesthetically pleasing. 'Ice Age (2002)' paints a stylistic yet consistent world full of envelope-pushing environmental effects (ala snow and water) that ground the cartoon-esque physics and give them a proper weight. It's really the interplay of the main players that marks this piece as a cut above the rest; each of them arise as distinct individuals with believable arcs and interesting dynamics. Plus, the feature is much more emotionally affecting than you'd expect and is pretty funny, too (especially in a couple of stand-out set-pieces, most notably a dodo debacle). 7/10.",Ice Age

Even after I saw this film nearly 20 times, I still laugh hard which is not very often for a lot of comedies. This story is about a shrewd woolly mammoth, a dumb sloth, and a baby-hungry saber toothed tiger trying to return a lost baby to its tribe before a pack of tigers ambush the baby and the gang. The acting in the film is great. Ray Romano and John Leguizamo were hilarious as their parts. Denis Leary as Diego is good too. I liked the music in this film. I think the score is great and the one song by Rushed Root featured in the film. Overall, this is a suitable movie for people of all ages. I rate this film a 10/10.",Ice Age
25,lesleyharris30,"Fun for the Whole Family, but More so for Kids,",7,23 July 2015,"Ice Age is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific voice cast. It's certainly a very original animated film, focusing around a group of animals as the ice age begins, it's quite funny and the characters are very likable, it also has a lot of heart and the ending of the film is very sweet, I also really loved Scrat's scenes, being my favourite parts of the entire franchise. It's a fun movie, but it's definitely much more entertaining for kids, I loved it when it first came out, I probably would have rated it ten back then, but now I'm giving it a seven as it just dosen't hold up as well when you're older, it dosen't have enough humour for adults to laugh, something that is evident in all the best animated films, such as Monsters Inc and Shrek, it's understandable that it wanted kids to be its target audiences but there should have been more in it for an older viewer. The ending is very anti-climatic, as the story finishes, we are left feeling there should have been more, it definitely could have been at least ten minutes longer, to give us a better idea where the characters were headed, how their relationship has changed over the course of this movie and give them more closure with the child. It's certainly not the finest animated film, but Ice Age is still sure to entertain and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. As the ice age begins, three animals discover a lost human infant, they must travel far and wide to find his tribe.",Ice Age

It reminds a little of ""The Lion King"" and Mammoth and Sloth are quite similar to Shrek and Donkey, who premiered a year earlier. But regardless of questionable originality, the story is very emotional with lots of gags and witty remarks and 80 minutes will fly by in a jiffy. Animation and sound are excellent, the story of friendship, devotion, and self-sacrifice is universally susceptible to both children and adults, and along the way, you will learn how dodo birds became extinct, the origins of the continents and, of course, what squirrel is capable of in order to preserve her acorn.8/10",Ice Age
28,The-Sarkologist,"Entertaining, but nothing new",5,2 March 2019,"I had this idea that this film, and the sequels, are basically about this squirrel, which is actually a sabre tooth squirrel, named Scrat, that is running around trying to do something with its acorn. Well, it is sort of like that but it is sort of a lot more than just that, he really is only something that sort of happens in the background, but he does keep on popping up throughout the story, and not surprisingly the movie opens with him, and closes with him.Anyway, this is one of those films that I have actually been meaning to watch for quite a while but never really got around to it. I guess being as old as it is now sort of starts to give some character to it, and it also makes me think that maybe there is some actual staying power to it, especially since a number of sequels (four) were spawned out of it. Well, it turns out that this was not really the case.So, other than our squirrel, which is really only a background character, the film is about how a Wooly Mammoth named Manfred, and a Sloth named Sid are attempting to get a human baby back to their parents. The catch is that humans aren't actually seen as being all that nice - not only are they predators but they are apex predators, which is why the sabre tooth cats sort of have a problem with them.Yeah, this is one of those quest stories, but it is also a story about how three unlikely people are thrown together and end up becoming good friends, particularly since one of them is a sabretooth tiger and sort of has some rather dubious ulterior motives. Then again, as can be expected with a lot of similar films, we can probably work out where this is all heading.Manfred is rather interesting though because he is a lonely and brooding character that seems to be going against the grain. Everybody is migrating south, but he is heading north. As for Sid, well, he is just plain annoying, namely because he gets left behind when everybody else sort of decides to head south - they basically decide not to wake him up.I guess I could say that this film was fun, but honestly, there really wasn't all that much with it that made it stand out from all the other films that seem to come and go over the years. Yeah, it had staying power, but the catch is that new moves have come along, and all the kids who grew up with this film are all adults now.",Ice Age

From the animation to the great premise, this was an exciting and funny action adventure ride. This beautiful film has it all: humor that is really funny, thrilling action and adventure, wonderful characters and voice overs. The humor is brilliantly original and never really slapstick.The film also features much darker elements like double crossing, scheming, and evil plans of revenge. There are also very sincere and emotional moments, like a mother willing to sacrifice everything to save her child, a mammoth longing for a family, and a villain becoming a hero. The cute factor is evident throughout the film, and the characters steal your heart every step of the way. The squirrel, Scrat, is just lovable and adorable!!

31,tomgillespie2002,Familiar tale with some great voice-work,6,7 July 2012,"When a group of sabre-toothed cats led by Soto (Goran Visnjic) attack a group of humans that have been hunting their pack, a mother of a new- born baby escapes, inadvertently leaving the baby with the giant mammoth Manny (Ray Romano) and his clumsy, clueless tag-a-long friend Sid (John Leguizamo), a sloth. Soto puts his lieutenant Diego (Denis Leary) in charge of finding the baby and bringing it back to him alive, so Diego befriends Manny and Sid, who are returning the baby to the humans, in an attempt to mislead them into the path of Soto and his savage pack. But they have treacherous caves and a group of idiotic dodo's in their path, amongst other things.With a relatively microscopic budget (of around $60 million) in terms of modern funding, 20th Century Fox have managed to create a lovely-looking (although it suffers in comparison to the likes of WALL-E (2008)) piece of animation with a host of talented voice actors. Of course, due to its massive popularity, the Ice Age films have now produced three sequels, a Christmas special, and a rather impressive profit. I was interested to see why this was so popular, given the massive amount of CGI animated films being churned out these days that are of mainly poor quality. Although the film isn't exactly a classic, the well realised characters (and the voices behind them) and its genuine heart raises it above the rest.This kind of story has been done before, for instance it was bettered in Pixar's Monsters, Inc. (2001) that came out a year before, and although it would be harsh to call the film unoriginal, Ice Age does suffer somewhat because of this. But whoever's idea it was to cast Hollywood misfit John Leguizamo as the idiotic Sid deserves a firm pat on the back. He is the comic relief to the film, and if mishandled could have come across as annoying, yet Leguizamo's voice (coming across as Louis Spence crossed with Mort from Family Guy) and some impressive facial capturing makes him a very funny and endearing character. And every time the story seems to be heading into predictable territory (which is does often), a clever running joke involving Scrat, a sabre-toothed squirrel, trying to smuggle an acorn to be frequently interrupted, makes the film fun again. Hardly anything breakthrough, but there's much fun to be had and I will be watching the sequels.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Ice Age

33,johnnyboyz,"In spite of the title, this is very much a warm film; whether it's one for the ages is another matter, but it's affirming and exciting enough to recommend.",6,17 September 2011,"Ice Age is a three way buddy pic set in the pre-prehistoric era unfolding as a modern day road movie of sorts, in spite of taking place at a time many millennia before roads would even exist; a neat comedy driven by the rocky relationships between a trio of hapless creatures of ancient times gone by running on some good interplay and wily writing as we observe them negate a long, relatively hostile, terrain rife with the elements; sight gags and the fleeting pop culture reference. The film, a sort of two way riff on the likes of Shrek and Monter's Inc., is a workable and often exciting excursion into animation; made more impacting by the real lack of this era in planet Earth's long existence ever really being put to screen, particularly in the animated format. Where Ice Age is nothing above and beyond, it is quaint and timely; its attitude to what it essentially represents never more than evident during a more-dramatic-than-we-expect denouement, something which sees directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha exude an offbeat idea that primitive humans and plentiful mammals may actually co-exist peacefully in this unremitting world of food-chains and strife – it is somewhat nonsensical, and more than fanciful, but you've oddly swayed with it. The film begins with a short skit, within which we observe a small squirrel-like character speaking to us in agonised squeaks and offering us pained reactions to his pratfalls. His unfortunate exploits linked to never quite knowing what to do with a small nut he's managed to get his hands on are what follows, with an attempted burying of it in the snow causing a huge rift in the ground, a rift formulating into a crack and then causing a huge glazier to break off seemingly dooming all the creatures within the realms of this world. Those of whom it will affect the most dwell in the valleys and the forests below this mountainous locale; here, a large but seemingly downcast mammoth named Manfred (Romano) is, in a literal sense, heading counter to the tide as he walks against the mass exodus of animals fleeing this glacier rift and looming ice age. It isn't long until he bumps into Sid, or rather Sid bumps into him; a character who has to be one of the more talkative sloths ever devised and of whom is voiced by John Leguizamo - Sid's scenario seeing him left behind by that of his close family prior to disembarkment: for reasons that become clearer. The dynamic of Sid and Manfred's relationship feeds off the animated film of 2001 of equally good value in Shrek; specifically, Eddie Murphy's Donkey character literally running into that of the hulking titular lead following a mix up with those out to get at him: the nature of their later bond a clear riff on the said pairing in their ""little-and-large"" double act plus easily wound up nature clashing with the smaller element of the pairing's talkative nature. Away from these proceedings lie a pack of sabre tooth tigers led by that of Soto (Visnjic), who employs the services of one of his more competent aides, Diego (Leary), to swipe an infant from a camp of early-human Neanderthals amidst the chaos of a surprise attack; early-human Neanderthals of whom look suspiciously drawn from 1995's Pocahontas and its respective homo-sapiens. Soto has preordained this attack out of spite for the mass slaughters implemented upon the tiger clan that have transpired at the discretion of the Neanderthals. The tigers, with their predominantly Hispanic sounding Christian names and evident subscription to gang culture, allude to a greater extent of misrepresentation, but a misrepresentation of which isn't prominent enough to sag the film into a messy trough of any kind. Indeed, Soto puts it very clearly to the rest of us that it is a guided idea born out of a desire for retribution; a veering of the characters away from stock villainy sort and perhaps doing well to draw the more younger members of the targeted audience into identifying the politics of the two sides before having them take their own stance. The raid is a success but Diego looses the baby down a nearby river, only for it to end up in the laps of Manfred and Sid further on down the stretch of water; Diego's angling for it back clashing with Manfred's ignorance out of Diego's true intent as he strives to return it to the humans. Principally, the duality in Manfred and Diego's attitudes towards the primitive humans in regards to specific tragedies that have come to affect either their lives or existences is what's at the forefront here; later revelations linked to Manfred reveal certain truths that do not do enough to sway him onto the ill-guided tract of blood-lust and destruction that drove Diego pre-crucible. What unfolds is an often exciting, albeit reasonably routine, adventure film about these grossly differing animals connecting and repelling at various stages, with a neat framework concluding with quaint epiphanies we do not necessarily have much of a problem with no matter how channelled they may be. The film has fun with that post modern approach to animation contemporary American animations usually feed off, a tract reading something along the lines of ""real life in a world not entirely true to life""; the stopping for a mock-level crossing occurring shortly after we're made aware of the trio's travelling ought to resemble a holidaying family separate examples of this. We enjoy the film's sense of adventure, its grandiose feel in spite of it being a little over 80-odd minutes in length, as well as its core politic pitched solely towards its target demographic that teamwork persistently wins out in the end, and that when prejudices and such are put aside, things can more often than not come off for the much better.",Ice Age
34,filipemanuelneto,It could be much better.,4,3 August 2016,"This film is set in the Ice Age and tells how a mammoth, a sloth, and a sabertooth tiger join forces to return a human child to his father. Directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, has voice actors like Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Film.This is not a film I consider remarkable, but it's funny enough to not consider for lost the time I spent watching it. Although not easy to understand for young children, the film is appealing enough. Playing with the animals existing at the time, the script creates a situation, implausible but funny, involving a human child and a group of animals, predators and preys, united in a joint effort.The characters are not the most interesting but Diego, a tiger torn between loyalty to his brothers and friendship with fellow travelers, and Manfred, a mammoth mourning his dead family, deserve some positive highlight, giving the film a touch of maturity. The more negative note goes to Sid, an unpleasantly greenish sloth, which associates a grotesque aspect to an endless collection of stupid moments. Unfortunately, this creature is the largest attempt to make this movie something funny. The intelligent humor of other characters works better, making more digestible a film that, without it, it would be quite silly. The squirrel can also be very funny.The work of animators is regular and fulfills its role. The voice actors did a good job, particularly Leguizamo, who gave voice to Sid.

41,Anonymous_Maxine,"A great film for children and adults, but they needed more of that squirrel!",9,12 December 2003,"Ice Age is a visually stunning animated feature that takes after Shrek in that it is wisely aimed toward adults just as much as children - an important detail the oversight of which just about single-handedly caused the failure of Cats & Dogs. It is structured unfortunately like a birthday cake, in that the candy frosting is at the very beginning and then the actual body of the film, the cake, bears much less of an immediate appeal but is still willingly consumed.The spectacular opening sequence in the film is probably the most recognizable part of the film since it is what makes up the majority of the theatrical trailers. By far the most entertaining part of the film, it introduces a lowly squirrel (lowly in that it is one of the few animals in the film that doesn't speak) that makes occasional and very welcome appearances throughout the rest of the film. After this opening sequence (which easily surpasses the opening sequence of any James Bond film), we are quickly introduced to an accident prone sloth named Sid, who is saved from a couple of angry rhinos by a caring mammoth (Manfred) who would just as soon save his life and never be seen with him again. They become a grudging partnership when they come across a human baby, as their care of life itself overcomes Manfred's dislike of Sid and his desire to be left alone.I was a little disappointed that this was going to be yet another animated movie with talking animals (seriously, do we not already have enough of these?) the way I was with Dinosaur in 2000, but for the most part, Ice Age manages to avoid being a routine animated talking animal movie. There is a curious interaction between animals that clearly do not belong together, given their random places on the food chain. Sid sticks with Manfred because Manfred is huge and scary and able to protect Sid from the threat of predators if he can only convince him to let him tag along. Sid does this, even though this is obviously not a symbiotic relationship, and then ultimately they are joined by a sabertooth tiger, of all things, who they trust only because he claims to know a shorter way to get to the humans and return the baby, and also because he alone is not much of a threat to Manfred.(spoilers) The place where this film graciously strays from the routine talking animal movie is where the subject of good and evil in the film is concerned. It is no secret that Diego (the sabertooth, voiced brilliantly by Denis Leary) is a vicious predator with little on his mind other than obtaining this baby for his pack for revenge purposes and, as an added bonus, tricking Manfred into walking into a trap and feeding his whole pack of tigers with his abundance of meat. This develops a wonderful situation in that we never know what is going to happen and who to trust, and even this involving story is intercut with things like the thrilling ice-slide scene (which mirrors the sheer thrills created by the door factory scene in Monster, Inc., arguably the best scene in the film), and blanketed by the breathtaking animation first introduced in a mainstream film with Toy Story in 1995.There is, however, a rather unfortunate quality to the mixing of the characters here, in that it so effectively portrays the carnivores as the bad guys, the evil part of the necessary good and evil ingredients in order to have a story. Also like Cats & Dogs (which chose to impose the characteristic of evil onto one of the two breeds of rivals seemingly at random), this film chooses to present the carnivores as the evil ones, but at least the reasoning is apparent here. The sabertooth tigers are meat-eaters, they kill other animals for food (and talking animals at that!), so clearly they have to be presented as the antagonists. Never mind the fact that humans are much more vicious and violent predators than sabertooth tigers, right? Newsflash, vegetarians, if you only want to eat things that were never alive, I hope you can get used to a diet of sand and rocks, because that is just about all that's going to be on the menu.Just kidding, I actually applaud people who make restrictions in their diets because of the things that go on in slaughterhouses. Killing animals for human food is one of the least supervised industries in the world by the animal rights groups, and these practices sicken me to no end (although have little to no impact on my own gleeful consumption of meat), but I hardly think this is an adequate reason to portray sabertooth tigers, who are doing nothing more than following their natural instincts, as evil because of their longing for such a large quantity of meat as Manfred would provide them.The end of Ice Age is the point where the movie comes dangerously close to being overly sentimental and cheesy, given the tearful antics that go on when the baby is returned to the humans. Sid and Manfred give their teary goodbyes just as Diego staggers over the horizon (assuring us that he is not really dead), to do a little peek-a-boo at the baby and then give a little wave. This is cheesy crap, but the rest of the movie is good enough to allow for a little over-sentimentality like this.The best things about Ice Age were things like the rearrangement of the food chain in the partnership that develops throughout the film, the sheer comedy involved in the squirrel's unending efforts to stow away acorns for a winter that is already here, and the new idea of where the English language may have come from (humans don't speak!!). Despite the ham-handed message of vegetarianism that permeates the film from beginning to end (which I dislike more for its blatant ham-handedness than its presence at all), Ice Age proudly carries the distinction of being one for the whole family and not just one that the producers want you to BELIEVE is one for the whole family, as was the case with Cats & Dogs. Enjoy it, and don't sit too close to the TV.",Ice Age

It felt like the animators were so lazy they forgot to make it more realistic looking as the backgrounds look so generic its like what you see in a Barbie movie or a made for TV or straight to DVD animated film with the quality of the film. Maybe its only my opinion on it but it didn't seem as realistic as let's say Big Hero 6 or Tangled which had more realistic backgrounds than this but I guess the two I have mentioned are from Disney,while this is 20th Century Fox.Overall thought if you love Shrek,you will like this film.4/10",Ice Age

What peril over yon hill awaits these merry travelers?Manny is the linchpin of the trio. He's a lone mammoth, staying put when all others of his kind (as well as of any other kind) begin their yearly migration to a more arid climate. Manny is morose and a little bitter, but this is quickly recognized as a facade for a warmhearted mammal. He initially wants to stay a lone mammoth, but he's soon joined by the ever-jabbering Sid, who's a little short on both brain and brawn power. When a baby human is left behind by his dying mother, Sid convinces the immovable Manny to help transport the tyke back to his family.The two are joined by Diego, a saber-tooth tiger who was in on the attack on the family and tribe of the young human. Diego's been ordered to retrieve the baby by the head tiger, who wants to do all sorts of nasty and unspeakable things to the infant. Diego's plan is to ingratiate himself with Sid and Manny, offering to take them to the area where they can meet up with the human tribe. Which is fine with Manny, who just wants to be rid of the kid - and Sid.Ice Age, then, is a good old-fashioned buddy pic. The three disparate animals, each outcast in very subtle ways, form a bond that has a common goal. Along the way, they face dangers more of the nature type than of the predator type, and each saves and is saved. But this isn't a movie about great moral lessons; it's a damn hilarious laugh-a-minute cartoon. It's aimed at kids, of course, although the style of animation (it looks a little closer to Toy Story than, say, Looney Toons) can be appreciated by adults, too. But what makes this such a cool movie is that the writing and the timing of the humor - and it's heavy into physical comedy - are impeccable. Sure, it's easier to do this with animation than with live action, but any movie at which I can laugh out loud, unprompted, at a near-constant rate is a surefire winner. Of course, at this point most kids have seen this - pardon me for being one of the last - but if you can still spot it in the theater, please do go.",Ice Age

I struggle to get invested in them trying to save this human. He just seems like a nuisance.

47,noralee,Laugh Out Loud Funny,8,22 December 2005,"""Ice Age"" is a lot of fun! It's laugh out loud funny, even though it's not ""Shrek"" or ""Chicken Run"" but it's definitely entertaining for adults, including shots like a passing reference to ""The X Files"" movie and showing why the dodo became extinct. Sure it sticks with Disney-established cartoon clichés of orphaned kid, wisecracking side-animal and nature that's scary and dangerous.But the odd trio of stand-up comics with thick New York accents of Ray Romano, Denis Leary and John Leguizamo work really well off each other.I didn't recognize the voice of Goran Visnjic from ""E.R."" as the villain.I was disappointed that they didn't bother to do any original songs, just a recap of the old Rusted Roots song ""Send Me On My Way,"" though that does happen to be a fave of mine.(originally written 3/17/2002)",Ice Age
48,slokes,Fun With Fossils,6,25 November 2014,"If you want a showcase presentation for your big-screen Blu-Ray TV, ""Ice Age"" is a good way to go. It's brilliantly animated, with amazing texture and detail. As a story, it's more than a bit sloppy, and the humor is hit-and-miss, but it does get better as it goes and makes for painless companion viewing with the little 'uns.Long before the dawn of modern man, we join a migration of prehistoric mammals – heading north instead of south. For Manfred (Ray Romano), a mammoth, and Sid (John Leguizamo), a giant sloth, it's less a marriage of convenience than the fact they have no one else. They meet an abandoned Neanderthal baby and a saber-toothed tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) with an unhealthy interest in taking the kid for himself. The three work out a deal to deliver the kid to its missing father. Diego's true motives are just the start of their trouble.Basically an animated, kid-friendly version of the John Wayne cowboy flick ""3 Godfathers,"" ""Ice Age"" presents a harsh winterscape of high imagination. An early example of a fully computer-animated movie produced not by Pixar or Dreamworks but the smaller Blue Sky Studios, ""Ice Age"" is remarkable for its tactile depiction of snow and water as well as the strange beasts long extinct that make up its cast.It's not all that funny or engaging on its own. The banter is merry but tends to be unmemorable.""How do we know it's the Ice Age,"" we hear one critter ask.""Because of all the ice!"" answers another.The best things about the movie, beyond the sheer spectacle of it, are the voice work of the main actors and David Newman's infectious musical score. Co-directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha seem more amused by the plight of ""Ice Age's"" luckless critters than they have a right to be, particularly a poor sabre-tooth squirrel named Scrat whose attempts at securing an acorn unleash a lot of Chuck- Jones-style mayhem without the twisted joy of those classic cartoons of yore. Any time the action shifts to Scrat, I wince a little, but the kids will like it if they are anything like the twisted brats I know.The film does get better as the relationships between the characters develop. The Diego story arc, as predictable and hokey as it is, pays off rather well. To enjoy ""Ice Age,"" you have to believe in the threat behind the story, and Diego provides much of that. Leary is very good at working the menace into the jokes, and vice versa, though Leguizamo is easily the funniest of the trio, while Romano makes for a solidly enjoyable center.Some things are not well explained, like the reason Manfred is so determined to journey north in the first place and why he puts up with the annoying Sid for so long. The film moves a bit too slow, even after it brings together our core foursome but especially before that. An emphasis on sentimentality, like multiple close-ups of the spritely Neanderthal baby and Manfred's backstory as revealed in some cave drawings, give ""Ice Age"" a weightiness it doesn't really earn. You just know the directors want to get the theater sniffling, as they admit in their DVD commentary.The best scenes do have the power to bring out the kid in anyone. If Blue Sky ever opens their own Magic Kingdom, I hope they offer an ice-tunnel ride or Sid Slalom of the kind we get to enjoy here. The film plays too much to its core demographic that way, but I found it preferable at times to the more adult sensibility of snarky Shrek or the Pixar factory.",Ice Age
49,Enchorde,Cute and funny,8,11 November 2003,"If you're to watch any movie with your kids, or just feel young in mind, this is your movie. A sloth team up with a mammoth that reluctantly agrees to bring back a infant human to his family, and the adventures start.I firmly believe that kids will like this movie but there are something there for adults too. Just keep track of the dialogue and watch for the details. Wouldn't be for the details, this movie would just be average. I won't tell more... good hunting!And yes... poor squirrel... 7/10",Ice Age
50,Agent10,Make way for Ice Age!,8,21 May 2002,"While the animation was sometimes corny (especially the humans), the dialogue between the characters was entertaining and sarcastic to say the least. Ray Romano fully embodied the bitter Manfred, and John Leguizamo's slobbery voice fit in nicely with Sid's persona. Denis Leary was also a standout, making his presence felt even though his character wasn't meant for comic relief. A funny, solid film that doesn't last too long (only 81 minutes) and doesn't overdo any jokes. While the story turned out to be predictable, the little interludes with Scrat were rather entertaining.",Ice Age
51,triple8,The cute Factor,6,7 April 2005,"SPOILERS: I didn't get into this movie all that much, maybe because I am not a big fan of animated pictures though I've started watching more of them, in the last few years, Thanks to a great movie called Shrek. Yet even though I wasn't that into this I still gave it a 6. Not a great rating but a bit above average. And that's for one reason.Ice Age has one main thing going for it and that's ""the cute factor"". In fact the adorable factor! Be prepared, people who may not have seen this, if you are an animal lover, you will find many friends here. I think part of the reason Ice Age was made was to make the viewer melt a little at all the cute little animals scampering across the screen. And yes it worked. On me anyway.Ice Age is NOT a movie I enjoyed strongly but it is a movie that pushed all the right buttons for me in terms of the cute factor. The plot does take awhile to get going. During the first half, I wanted to go to sleep. During the second half, I wanted to hug all the characters. They all reach out and draw you in on their wintery journey, particularly Diego (and that darn squirrel!!).Another positive is that the movie, blissfully, does not wear out it's welcome because it's rather short and doesn't go on and on and on. Ice Age is not a movie I'd watch over and over again, it's a little dull at times and is not in the league of a Shrek, but it is perfect when one is exhausted and just wants to lose themselves in cuteness. It's complete cuteness and warmth and sometimes that's not a bad thing!",Ice Age
52,onepotato2,aver Age (get it?),5,20 March 2008,"The first half an hour of this was so yawn-inducing, with cut-rate characters, and B grade ideas, that when the low-stakes conflict was introduced (returning a lost baby!?) I could not have been less interested. I turned it off with no interest in watching the rest. But then I needed something to fall asleep to later, so I put it back in.Yes, the movie had no hope of being better than a mediocre animated 'Three Men and a Baby.' But the quality improves a little. I laughed a few times (""Iceberg ahead, captain!""). And the sequence where Manny relives the demise of his family is touching, and subtly done in a style of animation based on cave paintings.The humans here are creepy, but then they're intended to be so. No one has ever provided an explanation on why the humans in Shrek are so damned stiff and disturbing.The DVD is designed so poorly that if you put it in your laptop it will insist that you view the games menu and not let you access the movie, even if you just want to watch it.",Ice Age
53,rosscinema,Predictable story,5,12 July 2003,"This is the second animated feature by Twentieth Century Fox and I thought the general idea was endearing enough but it just plods along in a very predictable manner. The story of course takes place in the ice age and we see a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo) being saved by a mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and they start traveling together during the southern migration. Also, some sabertooth tigers want to get revenge on a tribe of humans and the leader of the pack decides to steal a human baby and he selects a tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) to carry out this mission. He chases the human mother until she and her baby jump into the river and disappear. She washes up down the river where Manfred and Sid find her. She dies but the baby is alive but then Diego shows up and wants the baby. Manfred and Sid say no but Diego says he can lead them to a pass in the mountains where the humans are going and they can hand the child over. But Diego is really leading them to an ambush where the other tigers will be waiting. So the journey begins and at this point in the film Diego discovers the importance of being in a herd and how you should look after one another. The story is very predictable and you can guess what is going to happen before it even happens! There really is nothing new here. A band of talking animals protecting a human baby, haven't we seen that before? Didn't that happen in ""Monsters Inc""? The animation is not overly impressive although some of the shots have some good detail. As you watch this film the animation just doesn't grab your attention. I think part of the reason is the bleak landscape. How attention grabbing is the color white? It doesn't leave a lot of room for detail. I did enjoy Ray Romano's voice for his character. His deep and slow drawl seems perfectly suited for a slow moving mammoth. Its not a bad animated film and its hard not to root for these characters no matter how hokey the story is. But the story is really aimed at a very young audience and it should work best for that mentality. But if your a teenager or older than you will easily spot how familiar the story is.",Ice Age
54,invisibleunicornninja,This movie is dumb.,3,8 April 2018,"Most of the ""comedy"" from this movie is based in poop jokes and characters being stupid. The animation in this movie is lazy, and the story is dumb. When I was younger and the target audience of this movie, I was bored for most of the runtime so I'm not going to make the claim that kids will like this movie. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. Side note, one time in the 4th or 5th grade a teacher showed us that clip where the character Scrat created the continents and then told us that that was how the continents were actually made. She did not then go on to tell us that that was a joke and then tell us how the continents were actually made. That clip aside, this movie is filled with bad science.",Ice Age
55,RainDogJr,"""you know humans can't talk""",6,7 July 2009,"I saw this one when it was brand new back in 2002. Yesterday I saw the new Ice Age, Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and in my comment of Dawn of the Dinosaurs I wrote this: ""I was pretty much a fan of the first Ice Age, right now I have one adjective to describe each: for the first one (released in 2002) the adjective is great and for the first sequel (released in 2006 and called The Meltdown) the adjective is boring"". So today I decided to watch again Ice Age and it wasn't the same, it wasn't like in 2002. And I wasn't a very little kid back in 2002 but still 7 years are 7 years and certainly I remembered a much better movie, I remembered a much funnier squirrel but now I can say this isn't even better than Dawn of the Dinosaurs, of course this doesn't looks as good as ""Dinosaurs"" (still it is a good-looking movie) and well this is just an OK movie, entertaining at least.It's very simple, simple elements: three different animals, a mammoth, a sloth and a saber tooth tiger, will have a common goal which is returning a lost baby to his people. The saber tooth tiger while at first with a different goal will end being good, you know it is basic. The squirrel works a bit better here than in ""Dinosaurs"", it feels that it is a bit more stick with the main story. But still apart of that scene when the main characters ask it about the humans and of its very last expression (that happens 20, 000 years later of the events in the movie) the squirrel is never hilarious.So, yesterday I was thinking ""the first one was much better than its sequels"" but now I'm not, this is far from being a great.",Ice Age
56,nycritic,The Quest to Return a Lost Child,9,3 April 2006,"I have a soft spot for animated movies because even the lesser effective ones (HOODWINKED) have their own magic even when either their very story, overall composition, or continuity may bog it down. And due to the fact that they're aimed at the younger audience, it's become a staple that these films -- deemed ""safe"" -- have a simple plot allegorical in nature with clearly defined characters, comic interludes, a frightful chase sequence involving the main character(s), and a character that either switches sides from bad to good or from weak to strong which comes in at the crucial climactic, dramatic moment where a resolution is needed. It goes back to the days of Disney and BAMBI.ICE AGE is no different. It follows these elements closely in the story of Manfred the woolly mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego, a saber-toothed tiger, who due to circumstances not of their own making come together to return a child back to its parents. Throughout the way they will come closer even though the tiger may not have clear intentions with the child, and there is a truly beautiful scene when Manfred comes upon some cave drawings made by humans in which he sees the tragic story of his own breed. We see it too -- from Manfred's point of view. Both we and Manfred react the same way: with a sad feeling of irony.A very good movie that may appeal to young and old, ICE AGE benefits from the vocal personalities of its cast: Ray Romano brings likability to Manfred, John Leguizamo is great as the goofy Sid, and most of all Denis Leary, with his gravelly low menace of a voice, does a sharp turn as the conflicted, dangerous Diego. A cute story adds a little padding to the movie and exists in its own universe: a little squirrel trying to get his nut -- watch the end credits, which intended or not, sort of foreshadow the title of its sequel.",Ice Age
57,Lady_Targaryen,Ice Age is coming...,8,30 January 2006,"I watched 'Ice Age'in the movie theater and I liked the movie. Spite of the fact that 'Ice Age'has many flaws and scientific errors,like humans,sabers,dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same period, and even the location of where the story passes(looks North America,but has some characteristics from Iceland for example) we can have fun even so.(unless you are very severe!)

Sid is a stupid Sloth that is left behind by his own family, that can't stand him any longer.Walking in his way, he meets Manfred,or how he calls '' Manny'' a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and is going to the north. Worried that he can easily be captured, Sid decides to follow Manfred, and in the middle of their journey, they found a human mother with her baby. The mother dies but Manfred and Sid decides to take him and return the baby for the humans. Diego, one of the sabers, decides to follow and help them to go to a shortcut to the human's camp. What Manfred and Sid does not know, is that Diego is from a saber clan who hates humans and wants to kill the baby, and also pretend to betray they both to make they become saber's food.

The special effects are really amazing and the music well adapted. I have to admit that before I bought the DVD I had some doubts because when I was a little child I saw Walt Disney or Warner Bros cartoon and not CGI generated films.

61,MartianOctocretr5,"Appealing characters, good humor, creative story",9,20 October 2007,"A well designed yet wildly playful romp which is fun, silly, touching, clever, and creative all while telling a very sincere story. Of the many animated talking animal movies, this is one of the best.The characters are immediately likable. The film introduces the principals in a series of actions that demonstrate some favorable personality traits while revealing they have weakness too. As the story progresses, we get to know these creatures through their interaction as they slowly learn to trust and even like one another.The construct of the movie is a quest. A wooly mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger, and a sloth join forces to return a baby human to its people, after a tragedy the child survives. The mammoth was my favorite, a heroic and gentle giant who made the silent pact with a dying human to save the child. He has nothing to gain personally for doing this; it's just the right thing to do. The sloth makes a great comic relief sidekick, and the tiger Diego is a deceptively complex character that is developed well. The running gag with the little guy trying to capture a nut that is seemingly always just out of his reach works well and seems to fit anywhere they choose to put it.The characters grow in ways which are surprising during the first viewing, but the logic in how they change ultimately makes sense. The film tells a wonderful story, and some moments, like the petroglyph imagery are quite touching. The expressions on the faces of the characters are magnificently done; no words need be said. The wild ice slide ride (with its ingenious sight gags) are the other side of the picture, just some entertaining silliness for its own sake.The movie involves you with the characters, as you join them on their journey.

(Way to go Johnny Leguizamo!) While the sabre-toothed squirrel Scrat and his pursuit of nuts are apparently hilarious (maybe once) and have been overdone to death in the sequels, the relationship between Sid, Manny and Diego is the film's strength. Manny is the leader and most sensible, Diego is a little dangerous at the best of times and Sid is basically a well meaning idiot that must be forever watched over else he'll end up in trouble. As the three realise that they must stick together to get the job done and learn to put up with one another they forge a solid dynamic, which enhances the drama near the end of the film.This lead to a couple of sequels (so far), one OK, the other a bit of a cash in.What you hope kids will learn: If we all stick together and trust one another we can achieve anything.What they'll take away: The prehistoric era was like a big theme park with cool slides and funny animals.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Ice Age

The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, set 20,000 years in the past. The visuals were great. Simply beautiful.

They don't know whether to trust the saber tooth. Because he might have attacked the tribe(which he kind of did). The three animals try to take the infant home on a very fun journey. A journey that some may forget.Ice age is entertaining no doubt about it. But saying that it is art and a masterpiece is pushing it. Really pushing it. Luckily, I don't know anybody who has.

It gets the balance between being a kids movie while also appealing to older audiences just about right, which would explain why it is such at hit with people of all ages.This is certainly a good, fun family film and I remember getting a lot of enjoyment out of it as a kid. However, when comparing it to some of the other main animated family films of the 2000s, I can't agree with the ratings that put it among the best. For me, 'Ice Age' isn't in the same league as classics like 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Incredibles'.'Ice Age' is a good animated film that works for all ages, but I can't help but feel it is a little overrated.

However, that does not disqualify it from being an enjoyable movie. By contrast, this is a very sweet, funny, and wonderfully charming little movie that I actually prefer over ""Shrek."" Yes, ""Shrek"" is a better movie, but I personally prefer ""Ice Age.""Like ""Shrek"", the movie concerns a grumpy hermit, an irritating sidekick, and an unwanted burden all joined together on a quest. Only this time, the hermit is a moody mammoth named Manny (voice by Ray Romano), the sidekick is a rejected sloth named Sid (voice by John Leguizamo) and the unwanted burden is a human child whose been separated from his clan following an attack by a pack of saber-toothed tigers. One of the tigers, a cunning feline named Diego (Denis Leary) has also joined the quest to return the child to his clan. And as they travel, there's a rat-like squirrel known only as Scrat, darting around, obsessed with protecting his acorn against everything from nosey sloths to avalanches.The reason why ""Ice Age"" holds up despite an all-too-familiar plot is because it boasts surprisingly funny jokes, well-realized characters, a decent enough story, and much to my delight, a potent level of charm. The movie is not all light-noted funny moments. There are some surprisingly moving moments in the movie, including one that succeeded in bringing tears to my eyes. And that's the primary reason why I like this movie so much. It makes me laugh, but also warms my heart. Yet it does not overplay the dramatic hand to the point where it becomes mopey or too depressing for younger children.Overall, ""Ice Age"" is a very well-realized family entertainment movie. It's not a jaw-dropping spectacle or a revolutionary film, but it is influential, very funny, charming, and it can pull at your heart strings. And that nutty little squirrel Scrat, he never fails at producing a grin.",Ice Age

The two eventually stumble across a wounded human who in her dying moments gives Manny the baby. While Sid wants to return the baby to the humans, Manny has no interest. When a Sabretooth tiger, named Diego (Dennis Leary) meets them claiming to know where the human's have migrated Manny reluctantly accepts Diego's help unaware his pack has plans for the baby and Manny.Released in 2002, Ice Age was the first feature film from Fox's Blue Sky Studios who up to that point had been primarily a visual effects house with notable projects such as the cockroaches from Joe's Apartment and the Penguin scene from Fight Club. Initially intended as a more dramatic 2D animated film for Don Bluth and Gary Goldman the project was scrapped with the closure of Fox Animation Studios after the failure of Titan A. E. but was salvaged by Blue Sky Studios as a project to test the viable of the studio in feature CGI animation. The movie became a smash hit upon release become the 8th highest grossing film of 2002 and launching an enduring franchise that has ingrained itself in popular consciousness. The movie itself is a familiar story, but well told even if its balance of humor and pathos isn't quite as surehanded as it wants to be.In terms of story the movie is essentially a reworking of the 1913 novel Three Godfathers which itself has inspired notable films ranging from the John Wayne adaptation to the 80s comedy hit 3 Men and a Baby (and its French source film). The movie's ragtag trio who set out to bring the baby back to civilization are well done with John Leguizamo's Sid playing a well meaning but clumsy and unaware doofus, Ray Romano's Manny who plays the emotionally distant curmudgeon harboring quiet sadness, and Denis Leary as the sinister but conflicted Diego who plays the moral ambiguity of his character quite well with some really good scenes both humorous and character based that play well with the character. The interactions between the core trio are pitch perfect in timing with rapid fire exchanges well complemented against the animation.The animation in Ice Age is quite impressive. While the film doesn't try to go for the realistic aesthetic of Shrek, the movie uses a more stylized approach going for more exaggerated designs that play well with the world established. The work on fur and water in particular is quite impressive as the fur will get matted or wet and react accordingly in some impressive texture work.The story is pretty thin clocking in at about 73 minutes not including credits. The movie never feels rushed and plays at a good pace, but there are moments where the comedy feels like it outweighs the more dramatic moments and it feels like a very ""post Shrek"" movie with a number of anachronistic gags and jokes that aren't as well integrated here and do call attention to themselves. There's also a fair number of scenes with an undercurrent of tragedy to them that feel like leftovers from when this was a more dramatic project and while the scenes are well done (including a cave painting sequences that is as beautiful as it is tragic) they do find themselves somewhat at odds with over the top visual gags, slapstick, and reference humor that the film keeps focusing on.Ice Age isn't a great film, but it's a good well made one. With likable characters, well timed animation, and a fun if familiar adventure, Blue Sky's debut feature showed they were an animation house that could play on the same level as Dreamworks and Pixar.",Ice Age
73,blott2319-1,"Cute, but it's no Pixar",6,25 August 2020,"There's a pleasant charm to Ice Age that reminds me of when I was young and enjoyed watching The Land Before Time. I think they created some humorous characters and do a decent job of developing all their stories as they journey on a road trip to return a human baby to her family. It's a little annoying that my grown-up mind can't shut out the thought that the entire thing is futile. I mean, we're introduced to a series of creatures who will soon be extinct, so it just feels like they're on a slow march to their doom. That aside, it's a cute film, and I can see why kids would enjoy it and these characters would continue to live through a multitude of sequels. The comedy worked OK for me, but there's nothing about this story that is transcendent like you might expect from other modern animated films. Ice Age has enough heart to keep an adult entertained, but not enough interesting story elements to keep me coming back to watch it again.",Ice Age

And their first film they ever made.Ice Age is taken place in the Ice Age of course. So we get to see prehistoric animals and native cavemen.The story focuses on 3 different mammals that don't get a long at first but in time they do.Manny is a Mammoth who's very grumpy and doesn't want to go to the migration with the other animals. You eventually learn why he's always in a bad mood when it comes to humans.Sid the Sloth, is annoying and funny in both ways. His family left him home alone and didn't bother to wake him up for the migration. Sid encounters Manny. Manny find Sid annoying, but eventually becomes friends with him.Diego the SabertoothTiger is put on a job to get a human baby for his pack to feast on. But when the baby went into the care of Manny, Diego will have a hard time in getting the baby. So he just stays cool and acts like he knows where the baby's tribe is heading. So Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are on a long journey through the snow. Hoping to find encounter the tribe so that the baby will be safe and sound.Ice Age is a good movie.

75,Andy-296,Enjoyable and well done animated film,8,4 March 2008,"A very enjoyable animated feature, whose plot is loosely based on 1948's classic western from John Ford Three Godfathers. Set during (of course) the last Ice Age, the story has a mammoth called Manny, an annoying sloth named Sid and a duplicitous saber tiger called Diego finding a dying human mother along with her baby. They decide to return the infant to their tribe, against all odds, and facing a series of predators (especially saber tigers, who count on Diego on helping them on the inside). Punctuating the plot, a squirrel tries to save an acorn in a series of very funny vignettes. And a running joke is that the only species that do not talk during the movie are human beings. Unfortunately, the graphics are a bit below standard (they are no match for Pixar's works). The sequel has better graphics but a far less interesting plot (though it has a very funny final scene).",Ice Age
76,Beta_Gallinger,"Humour, touching moments, action, and great animation make this a worthwhile CGI film",8,11 November 2009,"After Pixar and DreamWorks Animation had made successful CGI animated movies, Blue Sky Studios, another computer animation company, made their feature-length debut with this 2002 blockbuster, ""Ice Age"". Even though this was apparently both a critical and box office success, and has spawned two sequels since then, it took me years to finally get around to seeing it. I'm not exactly sure why, since I've been aware of its existence for a few years now and saw ""Robots"" nearly four years ago and ""Horton Hears a Who"" last year. However, despite how long it took me to finally watch it after all these years, I now have seen it. Aware of its popularity beforehand, the movie did not fail to meet my reasonably high expectations.The story takes place many thousands of years ago. An ice age is coming, and animals are migrating south to escape the increasingly cold weather. A goofy, motormouth sloth named Sid wakes up to find that his family has migrated without him, and he is alone. As he tries to migrate on his own, he meets two rhinos and accidentally angers them. They want to kill him, but as he runs from them, they are fought off by a woolly mammoth named Manfred, whom Sid calls ""Manny."" Sid begins to follow Manny, even though the mammoth finds him annoying and wants him to go away. Nearby, saber-toothed tigers invade the camp of a human tribe in an attempt to eat an infant as an act of revenge! The mother of this infant runs away with him and jumps into a river, leading her to Sid and Manny. Manny saves the baby just before his mother drowns, and the mammoth and sloth must attempt to get him back to his father. Diego, one of the tigers who attacked the camp, helps the two, but what they don't know is that he is leading them to a trap! The animation here is amazing, which is often the case in these CGI films. They developed some beautiful imagery of frozen land. I didn't like the way the humans were animated as much as the way the animals were, but animation-wise, I definitely can't complain about anything else. There's a lot of humour in the film, often thanks to the goofy antics of Sid, voiced by John Leguizamo (though other characters can also be very funny as well), and the comical situations and conflict the main characters get into on their adventure. The subplot with a squirrel named Scrat trying to bury his acorn in various places is also pretty funny, if you like physical humour. Around the beginning, it may look like the film relies mainly on the animation and laughs for entertainment value, but as it goes on, it proves this isn't quite the case. There are some good action sequences, and eventually some touching moments and good morals, which it wouldn't be the same without. Of the three main cast members, Leguizamo was the only one I wasn't familiar with, and he does a nice job with his voice-over. There's also good voice acting from comedians Ray Romano (Manny) and Denis Leary (Diego).Since they started making full-length computer animated movies in the 90's, I've seen many that have come out over the years, and have found that some are masterpieces while others are basically average (haven't seen any terrible ones, though it takes a lot to make a movie terrible to me). Like a number of others I've seen, this one comes somewhere in between, but fortunately comes closer to the former. I guess I can see why this 2002 release doesn't have appeal as wide as several Pixar efforts do, but can also see why it is quite popular nonetheless. ""Ice Age"" was a good way for Blue Sky Studios to make their feature-length debut, and they have since gone on to do more good stuff. This movie has a simple but effective plot, plus a lot more to entertain viewers of different ages, making it another example of good family entertainment. Regardless of your age, if you like computer animation, this particular film probably isn't one to miss.",Ice Age
77,vip_ebriega,Scrat steals the show. Everything else is just fine.,8,3 January 2009,"My Take: Nowhere near SHREK on the level of craftsmanship, but amusing and energetic enough. ICE AGE may not be a much for SHREK nor TOY STORY 2, but with fine characters, an appealing (of somewhat familiar) story and terrific animation (fur has never been this accurate), ICE AGE earns its place in the animation milestone. A trio of Pleistocene critters including Manny the moody Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), a talkative sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo) and a shady sabertooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) come together when they come across a baby Neanderthal whom they plan to bring back to his tribe. While on the other hand, Diego's pack of hungry sabers, led by its vengeful leader (Goran Visnjic), look on the little human as a snack (while also looking at the mammoth as a little bonus).There's really not much of a story, partly being the main plot itself has already been done on MONSTER'S INC., released almost the same time as this film. Basically, it's just an environment-hopping adventure moving from one place to another, encountering critter (a pair of grumpy rhinos) to critter (a flock of dimwitted dodos who plan the biggest hibernation of their lives, with a stock of only three melons). The animation is fairly well, with the computerized fur almost nearing its perfection. The comedy is surprisingly sharp, with great help from the always reliable Ray Romano on the helm. ICE AGE is yet to be on the level of SHREK or other competitions, but it's a fine start for (hopefully) great things to come. Rating: **** out of 5.",Ice Age
78,jhclues,Iceberg Ahead!,7,30 March 2002,"From the realm of digital animation, this is a film that is geared to the younger set, but one that most adults will find pleasantly entertaining, as well.  Heavy on visual humor, with a few one-liners thrown in for good measure, `Ice Age,' directed by Carlos Saldanha and Chris Wedge, is a fairly pedestrian, family comedy that is viewer friendly and has a heart as big as it's main character, who just happens to be a mammoth named Manfred.	It's the Ice Age, and the migration is on; but as the mammals begin to move, three very distinct individuals are about to be thrown together by circumstances of fate:  Manfred the Mammoth (Ray Romano) insists on going against the tide of the migration movement (literally), and it brings him in touch with Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo), who awakens from his slothful slumber to find that he's been left behind by the other sloths.  Meanwhile, a pack of Sabertooth Tigers, led by the ruthless Soto (Goran Visnjic), is about to exact revenge on the humans, the hunters he feels are responsible for the decimation of his pack.  An attack is planned, with Soto especially intent on claiming a human baby as his prize.  But during the attack, one of Soto's pack, Diego (Denis Leary), fails to prevent the baby's mother from escaping with her child.  Outraged that the baby has escaped his grasp, Soto charges Diego with the task of locating the baby and bringing him back, alive.  What Diego does not know, however, is that the baby has ended up in the care of one of the most unlikely duos imaginable, Manfred and Sid, who have joined forces in an attempt to locate the humans and return the baby to it's herd.  When Diego realizes what has happened, he decides that his best shot at getting ahold of the baby is to join Manfred and Sid in their quest, which he does by convincing them that they need him-- a tracker by nature-- if they are to succeed in finding the humans, who are also on the move.  And so they begin their journey, with Manfred and Sid unaware of the treachery at hand, lying hidden in their very midst.	Unlike other prominent films of this genre, such as `Shrek,' or even `Monster's Inc.,' `Ice Age' is not terrifically clever or witty; nor does it try to be.  The strength of this film, in fact, lies in the very straightforward manner in which it is presented, and the filmmakers obviously made some very deliberate choices as to what they wanted to do with their film, and what exactly they wanted it to be.  Rather than go for the hip and hilarious, they chose warm and funny-- and it works.  There is some subtle humor, but for the most part the jokes are what they are; Saldanha and Wedge do not employ the double entendre, for example, so you don't have to go looking for what they're trying to say.  It's a matter of what you see is what you get.  	What they do give you are some engaging characters (especially Manfred and Sid) and a number of things that visually stimulate the funny bone, beginning with the hapless squirrel who mugs his way through the opening frames with a nut in tow (and who pops up occasionally throughout the film), whose bug-eyed looks and frantic antics are enough to start you chuckling and take you right on into some full-blown gales of laughter.  And it's all tempered so that it never goes too far over the top into `Road Runner' type slapstick, relying instead on some imaginative touches (such as the stages of evolution of the sloth preserved frozen in ice, with Sid falling into frieze briefly at the end of the tableau) and a basic story that's involving enough to sustain interest.	Anyone familiar with the TV show `Everybody Loves Raymond' will know what to expect as far as the Manfred character, whom Ray Romano infuses with the same wry persona as his Raymond TV character.  But Romano does it well, his Manfred is quite likable, and he even manages to create a couple of truly poignant moments with him.  Simply put, he gives you a mammoth to whom you can actually relate.  And that's a pretty good piece of acting.	As Sid, John Leguizamo gives a distinct voice to the film, creating a personality that definitely fits the wall-eyed looks of the sloth.  Like Romano, Leguizamo has a unique comedic style, and the contrast between the two works beautifully for their respective characters and the way in which they play off of one another.  And when you add Denis Leary to the mix-- which offers yet another distinct style of comedy (a bit more on the caustic side)-- the result is quite an interesting and diverse combination that in the end works extremely well.  It should be noted, too, that Leary is comparatively subdued with his character, while Leguizamo gives a stream-of-consciousness type performance, though he manages to stay just this side of Robin Williams territory (which is a positive within the context of this film and this particular character).  Most importantly, all three create characters that succeed in effectively telling the story, and they do it in a way that is not only inoffensive, but which enables the audience to embrace them, as well.	The supporting cast includes Jack Black (Zeke), Tara Strong (Roshan), Stephen Root (Rhino), Diedrich Bader (Saber-tooth Tiger) and Jane Krakowski (Jennifer the Sloth).  Entertaining, feel-good family fare, `Ice Age' is guaranteed to put a smile on your face and provide you with a satisfying cinematic experience.  And I dare not neglect to mention the educational significance of this film, too; I mean, where else are you going to find out what really happened to the Dodo Bird?  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.",Ice Age
79,Stampsfightclub,A definite watch for the whole family,8,1 September 2006,"When watching family animation I always like to have a good laugh and appreciate the sentimental and humorous ideologies as well as the fantastic graphics and this 2002 hit is one if not my favourite animation.This story sees a sloth; a mammoth and a sabre-toothed tiger form an unlikely friendship as they travel through the icy climate looking for humans to return the stranded baby.The story is slow moving. This way we can accept the different ideas put forth and gain the persona's of the characters. Its emotional, funny, and appreciative of the family comedy drama genre.The side story about the Scrat the squirrel is great and adds a different aspect to the animation genre. It's a little story about one squirrel and his nut and the physical humour is great.Having different animals the audience can gain an insight into different views, opinions on life. It's an unlikely combination and that's what makes the whole film exciting, because we don't know how they're going to deal with each other.The film is very humorous, it prides itself on physical humour although it does have some great speech humour between characters. Having humour was great but a real reason why I loved this film is because it is emotionally driven as well. The film sells ideologies of loyalty, friendship, families and survival making it a real aspect of real life. It preaches through the likable characters and therefore younger children will appreciate the ideas and realise how important they are in real life, because they will admire the characters and want to understand about life. Having humour combined with emotion allows audiences to accept the characters who are portrayed in a 'real' light.My favourite scene involved the three animals trying to rescue a watermelon from a group of dodos who are tripping over themselves, literally. It is hilarious and younger audiences as well as an older one can appreciate the hilarity behind the great physical humour.The CGI used is simply outstanding. It is used very effectively to gain the aspects of the characters. The funny expressions of the squirrel, the stupidity of the sloth, the greatness of the mammoth and he scenery is also outstanding, especially in the ice cavern towards the end.It's a different animation to what you normally see. Because of the high amount of loyalty emotional situations it is very different to your other animation films such as 'Toy Story 2' which should have been emotional but was comedy driven, and therefore adds something different.I definitely recommend it to anyone. It's a great film to watch with the family. You will laugh and you will cry when watching 'Ice Age' an enjoyable comedy/drama with a great energetic storyline",Ice Age
80,jon.h.ochiai,Part of the Herd,7,29 April 2002,"Director Carlos Saldanha's animated feature ""Ice Age"" starts ordinarily, then half way through it finds it's voice and says something remarkable about communities or ""herds"". This is a good surprise, and a welcome one. ""Ice Age"" is 20th Century Fox's entry into cutting edge animated feature market. Techincally, it is not on par with some of the Disney or Dreamworks entries, though what makes it promising is that it has a worthwhile story to tell much like ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters Inc."" Note that ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters"" are better movies. For one thing the story by Michael Wilson and the screenplay by Wilson and Michael Berg wastes time wandering in the first half, without really providing a context for what they really want to say. Our hero Manny, the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Ramano), is migrating south, though curiously alone. He is suffering over his family from his past. He saves a goofy sloth, Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) from a curious pair of male Rhinos-- a friend and I ""wondered"" about the nature of their relationship. The reluctant Manny agrees to take on Sid as a traveling bud. Along the way Manny and Sid become involved in the dark plot of a Sabertooth Tiger pack to kidnap a human child. Manny rescues the child in the failed attempt, and the child joins their herd. Sabertooth Diego (voiced by the always edgy Denis Leary) is the Judas who joins Manny's herd, pretending to help lead the child back to safely-- he is really following the orders of his leader, the evil Soto (Goran Visnjic). However, Manny saves Diego's life. Diego asks why Manny risked his own life for his. Manny says ""... That's what you do when you're part of a herd."" Now does Manny trust Diego, who is out to betray him? The ""Part of the herd"" or this community conversation saves ""Ice Age"", and offers value. Heroes and leaders can emerge from communities that are very diverse. And these are communities simply because they declared themselves to be--""Our herd"". Heroes and leaders emerging unexpectedly from communities are touching and inspiring-- what is cool that it is also expansive. Ultimately, ""Ice Age"" along with Ramano, Leary, and Leguizamo gets the job done.",Ice Age

82,Hollywood_Yoda,Ice Age: The Film that Jump Started Blue Sky,7,29 October 2018,"When Ice Age was released in 2002, computer animation was still pretty new, but it was one of the best visual films. Starring Ray Romano, Denis Leary and John Leguizamo as Manny, Diego and Sid, respectively. The story was different, and it wasn't Disney, so it was kind of slow at first, but still a fairly good family film. The animation and settings were beautifully done.Even sixteen years later, Ice Age is still a popular film that has spawned a franchise, including four sequels so far. Ice Age was also the first feature film from Blue Sky Studios, who later brought us Rio, Epic and Ferdinand. Ice Age was also honored with being nominated for best animated film at the Oscars, but lost to Spirited Away.For the voice acting, Denis Leary stood out as the best of the cast. Ray Romano, who had mostly done stand-up and Everybody Loves Ray, was okay in his first voice over. And Leguizamo could have done better.",Ice Age
83,fernandoschiavi,"Ice Age may not have the glamor of classic Disney productions or Shrek's acid sarcasm, but even so, it's one of the best and most entertaining animations",7,20 May 2021,"With the advent of computer graphics, animations have been one of the most profitable sectors of the film industry, with some products even reaching close to 1 billion at the worldwide box office. But for a long time that slice was only in the hands of Pixar / Disney and DreamWorks. Given this, Fox even tried to develop its own animation with the weak Titan A. E., which did not get the desired result by the producers. Therefore, Ice Age was launched with the studio's expectation to change this economic scenario, but was the quality of the film also prioritized?When we finish watching Ice Age, we get the feeling that we could have received more and we get that strange feeling when the credits go up, and this is due specifically to the script, too simple in its ambitions, without much news. However, this is the typical animation that is gradually conquering its audience, more because of the elements it brings together - like the characters, absolutely charismatic - rather than the set presented. And a more careful review is enough to see how strong its effect is today, so long after its debut.The story takes place 20 thousand years ago, when thousands of animals must migrate towards the south due to the beginning of the glacial period. Parallel to this, a tribe of Eskimos also needs to flee, but halfway through it ends up losing a baby. Luckily (or unlucky) for him, the grumpy mammoth Manny (Ray Romano) and the sloth who, with pardon the pun, are too lazy to think, Sid (John Leguizamo), find him. Like Shrek and the Donkey (released a year earlier, by the way), the two create a friendship by leaps and bounds until the arrival of the saber-toothed tiger Diego (Dennis Leary), who, at first, becomes the villain of the story. Of course, even the boy's surrender to the human tribe takes place in various amusing situations, from the teasing between the main trio to the disastrous attempts of the most neurotic squirrel in the world to get away with his nut. Scrat, by the way, is the poster boy for Ice Age to this day. It is impossible not to associate it when we think of the film.When we talk about imagination, the best way we have to release it is through cartoons. It's a run there, run here, supernatural jumps, stretches of body parts beyond normal, animals talking, a sloth making snowboard, a squirrel falling off a gigantic cliff and then being trampled by countless animals, like the little mouse on the leaf... and why not try to imagine a mammoth falling into a river of lava and then being thrown up by a jet of hot air? This way, it is easy to make children laugh and even some adults.With a simple reading of the synopsis it is possible to notice that the script, written by Michael Berg, does not have originality as a positive point, since, other films have already had premise stories where characters with differences need to stay together for a greater reason, such as those already mentioned Toy Story (with Woody and Buzz) and Shrek (with Shrek and Burro). In the case of Ice Age, there is Manny, extremely serious; and Sid, extremely chatty, with the mammoth constantly trying to get rid of the sloth, which insists on staying together and achieves its goal through insistence, becoming even more like Shrek's plot.Can we notice that the first act uses resources to unite the characters that end up being left without answers, as, for example, because Manny was going to the north while all the other animals migrated to the south? Or, why did Sid's family abandon him and travel without him? To make matters worse, the tigers, which can be considered villains of the plot, at no time really transmit fear, right in the first scene in which they are presented they fail to try to attack a small village of humans, showing themselves, from the beginning, incompetent in your pretensions.However, the story has merits, getting it right by developing a family relationship between the characters, using a narrative that can be considered surprisingly modern, with an outcome that shows how family does not always have to be blood, but who creates and cares, since all the protagonists are alone (for various reasons) and find support in animals of other species. But the story is not limited to that and even has an anti-conservative line, as in the moment when Diego meets Sid and Manny to try to capture the baby and says ""You are a strange couple. Oh I see, they want to adopt because they can't have one"", that is, even if in a subtle way, the film addresses the existence of same-sex couples.Another positive point of the script is the humor, developed not only through the dialogues that highlight the difference between the protagonists, but also in the moments when Scrat appears. In addition to serving as a good comic relief, the squirrel scenes move the plot, such as, for example, the cold period that begins because he breaks a glacier while trying to bury his nut, that is, in addition to being funny, his moments do not are in the feature for no reason.The Ice Age stands out nobly, even in the face of recent projections, which show considerable technological advancement. At the time, FOX invested heavily in the scenes; true paintings, such a richness of their colors and the perfection of the built landscapes. In addition, all this adapted to an agile script, with simple characters, but that are kept in our memory for a long time. Perhaps because of the simplicity of the plot, it is very easy to admire the qualities of his characters. The fact helps them to be well explored in their personalities. Not to mention the technical qualities, the look in which animals are really believed to live in that prehistoric period, to the perfection of their textures. Even the detail of the characters' hair is incredible, such a dedicated work by the filmmakers.The best thing about the drawing is that it was not ashamed of being short. Perhaps even as a strategy, because if it were soon, it would possibly become tiring. Many films of the genre are ashamed of not exceeding the 90-minute barrier and create situations that are of little use or curl up to solve some plot outcome. ""The Ice Age"" is not succumbed to this evil. The design has an impressive synthesis power, helping to maintain a dynamic rhythm.To give you an idea, during most of the film, we realized that the Manfred mammoth has some trauma in its past, but we don't know what it is about. When the time comes to show this trauma, the director does not call for a long and monotonous flashback. Instead, it uses an extremely simple feature that has a poetic beauty - also used in the animations of Clone Wars (cartoon made to show an excerpt from the Star Wars trilogy that was not explored in the films, which was shown on the Cartoon Network). Using the paintings that the men left on the wall of a cave, we learned in a few seconds what happened. And the scene still imparts an almost human dimension to the character Manny, by showing his attempt to do exactly what his executioners were unable to accomplish for him.Analyzing the English dubbing, I feel completely satisfied. Ray Romano makes Manny fit his voice perfectly, or vice versa. I ask: Would you imagine another voice for that gigantic, yet affectionate, mammoth? I could not. Okay, we can imagine several other voice actors for Diego, so we have many actors with bold voices for the character. In such a way, Denis Leary was chosen, who fulfilled his role perfectly. Diego's band also boasted well-framed voices, such as those of Jack Black (""School of Rock"") who brought the vocal chords of the character Zeke and Goran Visnjic (""Elektra"") to life, for those of Soto. In turn, Chris Wedge voices Scrat. Chris already had the experience of being a voice actor in the animated film ""Robots"". As for Sid, we see that behind every great animation character, we have a great voice actor. This is John Leguizamo. Stupendous is the lazy creature and even better his voice, which by itself, can already cause some laughs.A great success by Fox, which at the time only got along with animations (despite the good Anastasia, 1997, and Titan A. E., 2000). Not only was the box office surprising (almost $ 400 million worldwide), but the name of Brazilian co-director Carlos Saldanha was raised to stardom, giving him the opportunity to direct two more sequels of this saga (in 2006 and 2009), in addition to Rio (2011). As it is aimed at children, the film calls for some easy jokes, trying to force a laugh from the viewer. This feature works very well among children, who prefer a more visual joke, but which is lost when seen by a more mature audience. Ultimately, Ice Age may not have the glamor of classic Disney productions or Shrek's acid sarcasm, but even so, it's one of the best and most entertaining animations today.",Ice Age
84,Animany94,Worth watching.,8,9 August 2018,"Ice Age is an enjoyable family film with something for everybody. I don't think it's something spectacular, but what we get is enjoyable. This is a buddy comedy story we've seen before, but it is executed well with each character providing their own sense of humour ranging from the mostly goofball slapstick of Sid to the deadpan from Manfred and the similar style from Diego. But it's not only fun and gags, because these characters are actually pretty well made. Even though Sid primarilly plays the role of the socially inept one whom nobody wants he is both kind and brave when he needs to. Manfred may seem grumpy and stern, but their is a sad reason to that (no spoilers). Diego gets into their trip with a completely different agenda than when he pretends to have and that makes some good tension between the three of them. My only little issue with Ice Age is that the animation hasn't aged very well. Even compared to other animated features of its time it is not that great which is shown best in the human characters' unnatural look. You can't blame it for that, because it's a first from Blue Sky Studios and they did a great job. Even though it's been milked with pointless sequels which went in a completely different way than I had hoped, people seem to like it, because the box office performances sure don't lie. It all started with this enjoyable feature with good humour, good characters and some powerfull moments.",Ice Age

86,mitsubishizero,Ok though a little dated,7,24 May 2019,"I grew up watching this as a kid and I have to say I enjoyed it then and I still do now. The jokes are funny, the characters have well defined likable personalities and the animation's nice though by today's standards it's somewhat dated but I'll get to that.The story's about a misfit trio journeying during the ice age while looking after a baby they find. Sid(John Leguizamo), a clumsy yet well-meaning sloth trying to reunite with his family bumps into an irritable mammoth named Manfred ""Manny""(Ray Romano) and an enigmatic saber tooth tiger named Diego(Denis Leary) who may have a hidden agenda.Meanwhile a saber-toothed squirrel named Scrat struggles to find a place to store his acorn leading to several hilarious gags that indirectly effect the trio on their quest. Will they get to their destination without killing each other? I'll let you decide that. What it lacks in animation it makes up in story. The story's nothing new but what pulls it through are the characters and their chemistry. The jokes don't always hit but when they do they get a laugh. The scene where they're walking through the snow with the baby has some pretty good gags such as the scene where Sid throws a snowball at Manny a few times leading to Manny finally throwing a snowboulder at him.Sid could easily be annoying but he has charm and Manny to bounce off of leading to some funny scenes like the one where he's forced to change the baby's diaper. They're like an odd couple and Diego's the third wheel. The baby also gets some laughs too. There's a scene where it test Manny's patience by pulling on his nose hairs leading to Manny hanging him on a branch threatening to leave him there. I thought that was funny.The animation's fine though though as I said earlier some of the textures feel off. The snow never feels right and the people look somewhat strange and rubbery. The fur also doesn't feel real in how it looks and moves. Again that's just nitpicking. For what it is it's a good family movie. Take it for what it's worth and see for yourself.",Ice Age

Dealing with fairy tale lands where things don't always run to plan (""Shrek"") and medieval England (Disney's ""Robin Hood"" and ""Sword In The Stone"" to name two), it has expanded across vast potentials and often come out of it in one piece. In 2002's ""Ice Age"", animation went a long time into the past when man still hunted as a pack and mammoths roamed the Earth. With a predictable story and some relatively unknown names, this film might not have the impact and comedy value as other recent classics, but it does have enough humour in it to be worth watching.As the impending ice age arrives, animals migrate in vast numbers. Not all manage this however as annoying sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) is abandoned by his family and forces himself upon unfortunate mammoth Manny (Ray Romano). Now with sabre tooth lion Diego (Denis Leary), the two must travel across snow and ice to return a human child to his tribe. Along the way, this unique herd will bond as they face countless difficulties.As far as animation styles go, this film isn't that bad. Feeling distinctly out of place in comparison with more modern effects, it returns to an older style where animals were realistic, and humans were irrelevant. While humans might look distinctly block based however, scenes involving ice and steam are treated with incredible detail and look remarkably realistic.Humour in ""Ice Age"" is also just as inconsistent as the animation. A scene involving a huge number of Dodo saving for the winter is perhaps one of the funniest scenes to come out of animation since the turn of the 21st century. Simultaneously though, the ongoing joke about Sid's annoyance is quick to loose steam and by the end of the film, you find yourself more agitated than amused.Another flaw with ""Ice Age"" is a bad choice of casting. Sometimes the best thing about watching a cartoon is working out who does what voice. In ""Shrek"" and it's sequel, there was a ridiculous amount of star voices present. In more minor films like ""Robots"", there are less, but they are still distinctive. In ""Ice Age"" however, with the exception of the always noticeable tones of Denis Leary, very few voices are identifiable. In America, perhaps the voice of Ray Romano might be known for ""I Love Raymond"", but in Britain where the show never caught on, the name is a complete unknown and is unidentifiable.For an animation to be successful, it generally has to be funny, well made and with a cast of familiar voices. With moments of hilarity and some equally impressive animation, ""Ice Age"" does make some headway. Unfortunately though it is far too inconsistent and too lacking in the vocal front. A laugh to watch when there is nothing else to do, but it's best not to set your expectations too high.",Ice Age
88,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,The best Non-Disney film that reaches the emotional levels of Pixar before Dreamworks' How To Train Your Dragon,10,25 January 2012,"Generation after generation, Pixar and Dreamworks Animation has started to become very successful CGI animation companies creating such great hits like Toy Story (1995) a story about toys who come to life and face many villains and many dangers in lost of their adventures and Shrek (2001) about an ogre who is sent on a mission with his donkey friend to rescue a princess in an epic tale of pop culture references, but before they continue making more groundbreaking movies, Blue Sky Studios, a division of 20th Century Fox Animation, seems to be facing those two companies as they make their first debut in the CGI animation genre by making this their very first masterpiece from the past ten years, ""Ice Age"", a story about three Paleolithic animals named Manny, a mammoth, Diego, a saber-tooth tiger, and Sid, a sloth on an adventure to return a baby to the human tribe.Considering that I watched this a few times on video when I was little child after it's release in theaters in 2002 and still loved it even as a young adult, this film is the best non-Disney film that reaches the emotional levels as Pixar before Dreamworks' How To Train Your Dragon which also became a masterpiece in 2010 after this one.The story is very original with likable characters and includes touching and emotional scenes where Manny discovers that his kind were killed by the humans and I actually felt sorry for him seeing how we humans had done such a terrible thing in killing animals in terms of live-action and animation. It also has hilarious dialogue and laugh-out-loud comedy including where Diego and Sid try to cheer the baby up with Sid getting hit by Manny causing him to make a weird face which caused me to laugh my head off.The strongest aspects of the film are the animation and the voice cast. The visuals are lovely with the impressive look of the mountains and the look of the ice glaciers while having great character animation with the animation on the animals as the best. The voice actors are great. Ray Romano did a good job as Manny, Denis Leary did great as Diego, but I think John Leguizamo as Sid and the evil saber-tooth tiger named Soto (which is, in my opinion, the best non-Disney villain in an animated film since Rasputin from Anastasia due to his dark nature and intent on killing the baby) voiced by Goran Visnjic steal the show.The orchestra score from David Newman is also the strongest aspect of the film with a great opening sequence and a great song ""Send Me On My Way"" while having a mixture of drama, suspense, and emotion.Since this film became so popular it spawned two sequels with a fourth one coming this year, but not only that. It became a start of Blue Sky Studios' career in making other CGI films including Robots, Horton Hears A Who, and Rio and although not as compelling as this film, they were both enjoyable and fun. Since I still loved it, Ice Age will remain one of the greatest masterpieces of computer animation since Toy Story.",Ice Age
89,Pedro_H,"Well produced, but criminally short on content and originality.",6,29 February 2004,"Computer animation is merely a tool. Like all tools the tool actually creates nothing without human intervention and while they may be key to getting something done (this sort of  3D technique is relatively new) they are not a force by themselves. Only a new genre. Here a (talking) comic sloth, a stern mammoth and a slick mountain tiger work together to return a lost baby to its tribe. Well sort-of, but don't let me spoil one of the few lines of plot development for you!Boy is this thin and well trodden stuff. When two people can't stand each other in films you can be sure that ten minutes down-the-line they will be the best of pals, ready to die for one another. Shame real life isn't like that! Cliches are not cliches for nothing and the script writers haven't left anything obvious out - bar maybe a musical number, which would have at least been some light relief.I am reminded of a well known gag that Woody Allen once quoted in a movie about two old women in a restaurant. One says ""isn't the food here terrible."" And the other says ""yes, and such small portions."" This is far from terrible - indeed it is not at all bad - but the portions are too small: Character introduction - journey - climax. There should have been far more, but in this type of animation every second counts and every extra second shaves a point off the box office income!Glad I didn't pay for it though and anyone seeing it at a cinema better get a small popcorn or they will be still  eating it on the way home.",Ice Age
90,rebeljenn,"Fun, fresh, engaging - and the best trailer I've seen",7,30 December 2005,"'Ice Age' is a fresh and original animation taking place among animal misfits in the ice age. The unlikely animals band together to form a friendship based on returning a human baby to its parents and avoiding the evil sabre-toothed tigers from stealing the baby. Hilarious events take place on their journey, and it is a deeply engaging and fresh film. Children and adults both can enjoy this film.I remember catching the trailer for this film in 2000 - several times. The trailer itself was a work of art. As soon as the little squirrel came on the screen with his acorn, the audience was immediately hushed and wrapped up in the unfolding action. I have never seen an audience react so intensely on a film trailer. I think that they did a very good job putting the trailer together, and it is - by far - the most effective trailer I have ever seen. Watching the audience's response to this trailer time and time again was wonderful.I was amazed at how good the animation was. It's not totally realistic animation, but they did a good job at keeping it simple and not letting it distract from the action. The 'feel' of the film reminded me of 'The Lion King', but this story was much better; I was also not annoyed with the sloth character, but I was annoyed with Timon and Pumba from 'The Lion King'. I thought that all of the characters, including the secondary ones, were quite charming in their own individual aspects.

However, I found myself mildly surprised at the quality of this one. While the animation isn't terribly great, the story pulls the film along nicely. It's paced properly, with no wasted time. There is little need for violence, so there's very little of it. Drama and humor are the major elements in the film. Much of the humor is provided almost as a sidebar by a prehistoric saber-toothed squirrel named Scrat. He has the worst time keeping up with an acorn that he's trying to store away. The dramatic element is provided by an unlikely trio trying to return a lost human infant to it's ""herd"". The trio, a woolly mammoth, a sloth and a saber-toothed tiger, face several trials and some outside interference to try to accomplish their task. This was a pretty enjoyable flick and I'd recommend it to everybody, especially children.",Ice Age

The baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth, but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby. They went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger, and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth.

Then you meet Sid and Manny...My thoughts: It looks like Chris Wedge, who had done just little films before this film, could produce a motion picture SO good, that it became a hit at the box office (something which everyone seems to care about...) and it did well otherwise, making loads of people enjoy it all around the world (oh yes and they also put it into many different languages). Yes, this is a good film, no doubt about it. Pretty good use of computer animation, especially in background. The characters are very likable and their lives and personalities are very subtle in a good way (their past is certainly not easy to understand). The jokes are very good, funny and not too unclean (unlike in films such as ""Open Season""). The excitement is also not very high, a few fighting and scary scenes (not too bad for the youngsters though) but apart from that not much. Everyone wants action films nowadays and yet this was a big hit! I just don't understand it.So if you are a CGI liking child or a CGI liking adult, then you will love/like this in some way.Recommended to: Families who like animated films, people who like characters who are subtle and people who are interested in preostoric animals.

95,bopdog,Almost could have gone Direct To Video. Bright moments and lots of dull and bad stretches,5,22 March 2002,"""Ice Age"" is one of the most mixed and uneven movies I've seen in a long time. Overall it was ""OK."" There were wonderful aspects-- and some really bad aspects. The mammoth and the sloth, for example, were amazing bits of animation. The water at the end of the movie was also marvelous. Some of the scenes, though, were cheesey rip-offs of way better films. Note the similarity between the mountain cave passages in ""Ice Age"" and the flying whale scene in Disney's ""Fantasia 2000."" The flying whales, and the whole trapped under the iceberg thing--- was enchanting, evocative, uplifting, and a masterpiece. The rip-off version in ""Ice Age"" by contrast seems dim, depressing, and dreary.Much of ""Ice Age"" resembled the frenetic and abbreviated desert scenes of the later, crappier, Road Runner cartoons. I saw ""Ice Age"" in a small town full of ordinary people. The audience at my showing was a mix of small and medium kids and their parents. There were a few moments of ""Ooooh!"" and a few quiet chuckles. One or two kids guffawed every time an animal stepped on a stick and got hit in the face. Otherwise, the theater was pretty quiet. I think we were all waiting for the cool part to start, when all of a sudden, the movie was over.Referring again to the moments of goodness-- the tigers looked awful, but Dang! The mammoth and the sloth looked great. Their fur was so well done! But if it weren't for their great looking fur, this movie could probably have gone straight to video.Take the kids!

It is like they cranked previous cartoons through some AI morpher to create pseudo-new content.Manfred the Mammoth has a leading role. He has not a funny bone in his body. He is depressed, rude, a bully and self-centred, hardly a likable hero. He would be a fine side character, but he wastes huge amounts of screen time. He is BORING!

I have to say that I wasn't terribly fond of John Leguizamo's lisp thing in the film, but I can deal with it and won't make too much of a big deal of it.  It was kind of funny for about a minute, then it just got annoying.  But like I said after a while you get used to it and just live to deal with it.

101,EmperorNortonII,A New Age For Computer Animation,8,13 April 2002,"Animation has always managed to keep up with the current techology. Nowadays, the big thing is computer-generated animation.  The leaders in this field is Pixar, the studio under the wing of Disney, which has given us ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.""  Then, Dreamworks' partner Pacific Data Images came to produce ""Antz"" and ""Shrek.""  Now a new studio steps into the ring, Blue Sky, which is partnered with 20th Century Fox.  Its first feature, ""Ice Age"" has already shown that it has what it takes to be a major player in the CGI animation game.  ""Ice Age"" isn't as finely polished as a Pixar movie, but it is very well done.  The story has its share of laughs and heartfelt moments.  But the main draw is the sight gags.  The walk through the glacier cave is a classic example.  Plus, the antics of the Scrat also amuse.  Another good point of the movie is its portrayal of prehistoric wildlife.  Almost everyone thinks of dinosaurs, but few people are aware of the more obscure mammals that walked the earth after dinos ruled.  And an interesting cross-section is presented in ""Ice Age.""  Chris Wedge has already given us an epic in ""Ice Age.""  I hope he can continue to give the competition a run for its money!",Ice Age
102,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: great, not just for kids",8,31 March 2002,"""Ice Age"" doesn't have the intricate story arc of ""Toy Story"". In fact, the big picture story is fairly generic. A short, annoying but lovable pipsqueak who's always in trouble. A big ""straight man"" who cleans up the mess. Sound familiar, from ""Monsters, Inc"", ""Shrek"", going all the way back to Abbott & Costello?But buried within the generic plotting are tons of hilarious little skits. The film is as funny as ""There's Something About Mary"", and is the most funny 3D graphics animated film to date. The setting and the variations on the ice age are clever and original.Being somewhat cartoony, Ice Age does not shoot for the ultimate high-end in realism, but the animation is good (except for the human characters) and the animal fur is a special treat -- one of the hardest things to do well in computer graphics.Who should see this film:-- All kids over 6 (the film is PG but it's very mild)-- Adults who like comedies, won't mind a little bit of""it's just for kids"" in what is basically an accessible filmfor adults, and aren't overly arty. This is not high drama.-- computer graphics fans who like to figure out special effectsI'll give ""Ice Age"" an 8 out of 10.",Ice Age
103,dilipbts,Ice age,8,29 April 2020,"I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out, back in '02. I was only 13 at the time, but even then I liked it. It had some sort of warmth.We've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it, it never gets boring. This is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3D animations made at the time - The characters have no particular 'home' which they leave. They are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch.Also, each individual character on the surface, appear to be just putting up with each other, but they're really all good friends. As well, all of the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). Sid the sloth is charming in his annoying, over-affectionate and naive sort of way. Manny is adorable in his depressed, reclusive character, and so on and so forth.Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. All the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay, giving the film an artistic edge.Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie, is that gender means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film. Due to this, there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.",Ice Age

106,chrisbrown6453,"The animated Ice Age has more than a couple of visually exciting sequences. Well done story, but just not quite Toy Story quality.",7,24 June 2002,"A glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never-ending wet-slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001: A Space Odyssey. Miles apart in vision, but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless. A magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel-like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn. You've probably seen this scene in the trailer, but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and, results, an avalanche. The horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible. The movie traces two characters, a mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and a buck-toothed sloth (John Leguizamo) as they try to migrate south. They find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them. They are joined by a saber tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan, by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap. Diego's meat-eating family wants the mammoth most of all, but Diego's learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end. There are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip, including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in Shrek. Characters contemplate on why they're in the Ice Age, while they could have called it The Big Chill or the Nippy Era. Some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming. Another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends: `All the great guys are never around. The sensitive ones get eaten.' Throwaway lines galore, whimsical comedy and light-fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch. Also, food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as `good eating.' The vocal talents of Romano, Leguizamo and Leary make good on their personas, while the children will delight in their antics, the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents. There is some mild violence and intense content, but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age-old battle of good versus evil, and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties. The animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic.",Ice Age
107,bsinc,Funny and touching,9,17 September 2003,"Finally I got to see the infamous ""Ice Age"". Apart from maybe not being as dead funny as I'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word I can say about it. Sure, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production(besides, it is Fox's 1st attempt at a full length CG movie) but it's got immense heart and on some occasions(like the look in Manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past) I found myself on the verge of tears. But when they reunited the baby with its father I just couldn't hold them in anymore. A movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and cliché and manages to bring more than the best out of it; the end result being one of the most touching animated creations I have ever seen. Great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you(and great voice talents as well) and many funny memorable scenes, especially from Scrat's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002.I honestly don't get it, but for some reason it really looks like CG animation will be taking the upper hand in the future. But if it just means that there will be more movies like this one (and who can forget Pixar's creations) then I don't really mind, at least for now. 9/10",Ice Age
108,DavidSim240183,"Cold surroundings, but a warm story at heart",8,12 February 2008,"Ice Age marked the debut of Blue Sky Studios, another player in the arena of computer animation. Pixar remain the undisputed kings of the field. Just about every film they turn out is an absolute delight. And even less received films like Cars and Ratatouille have that magic Pixar touch.I'm not sure if Blue Sky are what you would call a truly great studio. Their films are amiable enough to make them instantly likable, but they somehow lack the shrewd intelligence of a Pixar film. Still, judging from Ice Age, Blue Sky have the potential to go onto a very promising future. If not a great one.Set 20'000 years ago, animals are on the move to find warmer climates now the Ice Age has set in. Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo), ditched by his migrating family, gets on the wrong side of a couple of hot-headed rhinos. But he's saved (reluctantly) by Manfred, the Great Wooly Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano).Latching onto Manfred, Sid comes across a baby human. His tribe were attacked by a pack of sabre-toothed tigers, and his mother managed to get him to safety before she died. Sid takes it upon himself to return the little tyke to his people, with Manny's help of course. But they have to contend with Diego the Sabre-Tooth (voiced by Denis Leary), who says he's out to help when really he's leading them into an ambush.Ice Age, although a reasonable box-office hit, could have brought in more money if it had opened in cinemas before the likes of Monsters Inc and Shrek. Because when you're watching Ice Age, its impossible not to think of those two films. Manny is the sullen giant saddled with Sid's annoying chatterbox...Shrek & Donkey. And the baby often reminds you of Boo, in the care of Sully and Mike Wazowski from Monsters Inc.But to say Ice Age is predictable is to shortchange its virtues. Because although its a rather slim film plotwise, it has surprising depths and unexpected charms.Manny, Diego and Sid are all quite well written. Granted they tend to seem a little generic. Manny's the loner who gradually thaws. Sid's the annoying sidekick who provides comic relief. And Diego's the unknown variable faced with a moral dilemma. But they're all voiced well by the actors, imbuing each character with a separate identity.Especially impressive is Denis Leary, who plays it totally straight for once. He never launches into the rapid, manic monologues that he seems to enjoy. He almost makes Diego seem dignified. And its an appealing moral dilemma the writers have laid at his feet.Half of Diego's pack were wiped out by human hunters. And he's supposed to bring this baby back to the people who slaughtered his own. The rest of Diego's pack are interested in settling the score, by feasting on Junior, so Diego is supposed to deliver him to them. Quite an interesting problem isn't it? And Leary rises to the challenge admirably.Ray Romano and John Leguizamo are both on good form. But its really Denis Leary who shines. He totally convinces you of Diego's struggle. Whether or not he should give in to his instincts. Or rise above them for the greater good. Its a great piece of characterisation. Madagascar tried the same thing. To much lesser effect.From the way I've described the film, you'd think it was a dramatic endeavour solely. But there are plenty of laughs to be had. Particularly appealing, and something that was a common staple of the trailers are the sidesplitting adventures of a squirrel trying to bury his beloved acorn. But because the ground is frozen solid, he can't achieve this one simple task.Everything he does to bury the damned thing sets off avalanches, earthquakes, lightning strikes, you name it. The scenes with Scrat the Squirrel are actually the funniest thing about the film. What I especially liked is they're told in complete silence. Scrat never talks, but he has an endless supply of squeaks, grunts and exasperated facial expressions on his neverending quest to bury that acorn. He arguably goes through more trials and tribulations than our trio.The filmmakers include obstacles for Manny, Diego and Sid to circumvent. A common theme for this type of film. The trip through the ice tunnels is a hair raiser. As is our heroes encounter with a lava flow. And in between the action, there's a quite poignant scene where through a cave painting, Manny relives the extinction of his herd. Its a scene where the film holds still for a few minutes, and allows you to feel Manny's pain.One thing I thought was an especially nice touch is the film's depiction of humans. They don't talk. Probably because they haven't mastered the mysteries of the human language yet. And in a neat twist, its perfectly natural to see an animal talk instead of a human. Its nice to see a film finding the time to take something like that into account.Also, Ice Age is mercifully free of film references and smart-ass hip colloquialisms. Things that have sunk many an animated film. DreamWorks is a particularly guilty offender. Blue Sky have no desire to distract us with adornments like that, because they're clever enough to know the drama is a strong enough hook to bring in the audience. And they're right.Ice Age is visually appealing, even if it doesn't have the razzle-dazzle of a Pixar film, but the characters dilemmas are really quite enough to draw us in. It may seem like an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, but its much deeper than that (and much better too!). Surprisingly forthright (the death of the baby's mother).

109,Flagrant-Baronessa,Sub-zero heroes on an adult-humoured adventure,8,28 September 2006,"I've been having a bit of an animation treat lately with films such as Robots, Finding Nemo, Shrek II and Ice Age and while I may have had my favourite all along, this viewing cemented ""Ice Age"" as the best of the bunch. It holds up amazingly well since its primary focus is not meticulous animation (like DreamWorks focus on), but story and humour. Sure, you could probably find an animated film with more heartfelt messages and substance than this (Finding Nemo), but I dare you to find a funnier one. This film remains completely unrivaled in the laugh-department.Its sequel, Ice Age: The Meltdown, rode largely on this humour advantage throughout and unsurprisingly suffered a few pitfalls when it attempted to 'get serious' by adding morals and messages. Thankfully, Ice Age does not have this problem because it knows it is mostly funny and it makes no pretense about it. Make no mistake however; it was originally written as a drama and therefore still has a lot of story to fall back on  the story of three outcasts turned Sub-Zero heroes (Manny the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger) joining up to return a human baby to its herd  and all the detours, diversions and conflicts that this journey entails, pinning the stunningly hilarious prehistoric rodent-squirrel Scrat somewhere in between, collecting his acorns. No words can describe how funny this character is but the special short on him on the DVD extra material should give you some idea.So if there is just this one template story and humour, without heartfelt messages á la Disney/Pixar and meticulous fluent animation á la DreamWorks, then how does it manage to be such a great film? I don't know, but it is likely that its success stems from the fact that it lacks these very aspects of its peers. For example, it does not indulge in homages and references to the same extent as DreamWorks (except one little Star Trek joke squeezed in) and it never falls prey to predictable sappiness in the same way that Disney does. Without these things it therefore NEEDS a great backstory and fun characters to fall back on  and it truly does.It is a bit more adult-humoured, too. There is a continuous gay joke with the rhinos Carl and Frank, for example. It never resorts to fart or pee jokes (ok - fine, there is a poop-joke, but so what?). There is an hilarious joke about modern architecture  Manny walking past Stonehenge and remarking on how ""it'll never last."" There is subtle use of irony in all the animals being able to express themselves eloquently while no humans talk in the film. It's insightful. The children's side of things is best tended to by John Leguizamo as Sid, who has clearly done something very cool with his character which ends up catering just as much to adults as its target audience  which is probably true for the whole film.8 out 10",Ice Age
110,willcundallreview,A fun animation adventure,7,2 April 2014,"Rating-7/10Ice Age is an animation which people still enjoy today, with some quick jokes and fun characters to be around the story truly lifts off and the plot is a fun one too any many cases. With a lovely voice cast to guide us through and it's running time being perfect, we can now truly say that Ice Age is not just a film aimed at 3 year olds. My personal feeling with this was that it is a strongly good movie and worth a watch, and so well here below is why I think it is a movie you should watch.The story is nicely paced and as said the running time doesn't drag it, it actually makes it better. The plot is fun and not icy at all with some fun jokes but with a sweet centre that can at times pull at the heart strings(well enough to say this is animation and extinct animals). I did love the characters to and I will get onto them in a little bit but they contribute massively to the story and make it flow even nicer. Maybe not superbly funny, the film I feel is meant to be just a big old adventure and if you enjoy that, then give it a go and see where it takes you.Now on to the characters, I particularly liked all three together as Ray Romano(Manny), John Leguizamo(Sid) and Denis Leary(Diego) work well and really make this film even more fun. Everyone talks about Scrat the little saber toothed squirrel who does make this film even more higher up in the world of animation with a performance that will be remembered for years, and everyone will remember he just couldn't get that acorn out. Finally on Cast I felt the voices were good and varied and I liked the way that the Saber toothed tigers sounded the same as each other, and things like the Dodo's also sounded similar.Animation isn't the top thing about this and I didn't feel it moved flowingly to be fair, although a fair point is that it was made in 2002 so I guess not to much can be expected of it in that department if made then. I loved the effect used though and some lovely looking things like snow falling and even fire are done well, but on the technical side of the film there isn't too much to talk about so best move on.It isn't that funny and maybe a point why this isn't a great film, the humour is there but sometimes it feels as if it is aimed too much at kids and that the adults taking there children there, just won't be in the cinema with them. I also said about the animation being a bit poor and well at times it can be very plain the movie scenery wise but in all fairness the animation was never a point I dragged this down on.I could just tell you that kids will enjoy this, but I also feel adults can too and if your up for an animated adventure then this is for you, especially also that isn't too long a film either. Those who want a really funny film don't watch and people who dislike more slapstick ""type"" humour also don't watch, but I would also like to say that I would recommend this film to anyone, even if you don't always watch things like this.Overall a 7/10 from me as I felt it was Strongly a Good film, quite near to being very good but what I put in criticisms just didn't allow it. Either watching this with children, or watching by your yourself Ice Age has a little something for everyone, you won't be crying with laughter but I do think this film will leave a little warm feeling in you, and you may want to see more of it, of which there is plenty.",Ice Age

Sharing a similar plot mechanic to Monsters, Inc. - goofy creatures discover themselves through caring for an abandoned infant - Ice Age is a likable, fast-paced, computer-generated opus that opts for good gags and enjoyable action instead of sappy moralising and Phil Collins songs.Sidestepping the attention to detail of Pixar, there is an intentional 'cartoon' quality to the character animation and backdrops. The comedy here covers all the bases, from the broad to the sly - in this world, creatures speak, human's can't.While the journey throws up the requisite thrills and spills, Ice Age's real strength lies in sharply-defined relationship dynamics and likable characters that are worth rooting for. Best of all is Romano's world-weary yet big-hearted mammoth - cold on the outside, warm on the inside. Just like the film itself.It may lack the fine-tuned inventiveness of Toy Story or the knowingness of Shrek, but it still delivers solid laughs and thrills wrapped up in an infectious sense of character.",Ice Age

114,LivingDog,Excellent characters,9,18 August 2007,"This movie is not plot heavy. It's really about the characters - who they are, how they interact with each other, and what their goals are. Manny the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth, and Diego the Saber toothed Tiger are the protectors of a child who they received rather surreptitiously... well Manny and Sid have, but Diego has a somewhat different idea.So all three head out to find the ""herd"" of humans to which this baby belongs. The baby is very quiet, happy, and very brave - a rare combination in any human. Regardless of this idealization (like talking, conscious animals are not?) all four are very well played out and voice acted (yes, even the baby has to be voice acted) that you feel that they are real and not animated. That's the success of this movie - since it is character heavy, then the characters must become real to the audience or else it would fail. Well it is a marvelous movie that kids of every age can appreciate and relate to in some way.One extra nod to John Leguizamo for his voice acting of Sid - who steals most of the scenes without being overbearing.There is one thing wrong with this movie - it's too short. :) 9/10-LD___________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",Ice Age

During the last Ice Age, Manny, a wholly mammoth, Sid, a sloth, and Diego, a saber tooth tiger, have become what they call a herd. Trying to survive the ice age, the three come upon a human child thought too be lost by his own kind. Being the good animals the three are they decide to bring the child back too his tribe who is heading for the America's. The adventure that follows is enjoyable and conveys a powerful message.The theme of the film is brotherhood and friendship. Throughout the film many aspects of the characters lives come forth and you witness how the other characters must unite to help one another. Some wonderful voice acting is put into play also. Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Leary all give excellent performances in the leads and help keep the smiles coming.What many must remember is that Ice Age is a kids film and some adults may not find the witty humor as funny as children. I guarantee though that children will fall in love with the characters of Sid, Manny, and Deigo and have some pretty good laughs while watching.3 1/2/5 stars",Ice Age

While the animation looks great and some of the voices are a perfect match (particularly Ray Romano as the Mammoth), there is still a lot of formulaic plotting meant to sheepishly tug at your heartstrings..  The animation is quite good, particularly a running repeating montage involving a squirrel like character and his desire to crack an acorn throughout the film.  There are also some pot shot humour that is clearly aimed at kids, (gags involving doo doo) and adults alike (We have to be the most screwed up herd in history)..So I guess all in all it turns out ok, but not a good picture, yet not a bad one either Rating 6.5 out of 10",Ice Age

And the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that I agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. As I said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, ""Ice Age"" is commendable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt.

Ice Age is much too under-estimated. It's better than Monsters Inc and just as good as Shrek. Perhaps the concept for the film may be familiar to the other two, but they were all in production at about the same time so you can't blame them for that.It is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and is always consistently entertaining. The visual gags and the wit should appeal to adults and children of all ages. While in Toy Story 2, serious scenes dragged the film down and made it lose momentum, in Ice Age moments of sentamentality are heartwarming and engaging. But if you have problems with your inner-child, thats not my problem.The cast may not be as well known as the vocal talents in Shrek, they still work perfectly together. Ray Romano exceeds Mike Myers (whose evident flaws were overlooked) as being the loner-like but lovable mammoth (Shrek was an ogre) and was highly appropriate for the part. No one will EVER match Eddie Murphy as the talking donkey, but John Lequizamo is a good contender as the comical sloth. Denis Leary is also very good. ER's Goran Visnijc is more of a Gene Hackman in ""Antz"" than a John Lithgow in ""Shrek"", and gives the film a darker mood instead of more comedy, which is fine in its own way.It follows a familiar outline, but Ice Age is always entertaining and definitely the best animated movie of 2002. 8.1 out of 10.",Ice Age

128,basrutten,Hit and miss animation,5,28 March 2006,"Back in 2002, animation movies were really becoming hugely popular, so it's no surprise that Fox decided to jump on the bandwagon with their first real effort at a CGI movie. The result, ""Ice Age"", is watchable but certainly no match for the Pixar and Dreamworks competition.To start with the good things, all the scenes involving the frantic squirrel/rat (""Skrat"") character trying to hide his nuts everywhere are simply great. The same is true for the part involving the hilariously stupid and suicidal dodos.As for real laughs, that's about it though. There are some occasionally funny bits, but for the most part ""Ice Age"" is too predictable and repetitive to be really funny. The constant bickering between the main characters gets old really fast, and the Sloth character in particular often crosses the line between funny and just downright annoying.Don't expect anything from the story or the characterization either. I don't mind that the plot is predictable (let's face it, most animation movies have similar plots) but it's so sickeningly cute and delivered in such a pedestrian, play-it-safe manner that it should really appeal to kids only. The characters also left me completely cold, other than that I felt sorry for Skrat.As for the animation itself, I have to say in general that it's below par, even by 2002 standards. This might have been intentional and for the most part the overly cartoony style works reasonably well, but don't expect to marvel at the visuals.In the end, I'd have to say Ice Age is still watchable. I didn't care much for the fairly dull characters and the overly cute and basic plot but there are enough funny bits to mostly make up for that.**1/2 out of ****",Ice Age

Now this film is as funny as SHREK, the first part is copying SHREK, except the rest of the film involves bringing a Baby Neanderthal back to it's family.

I have a hate/love relationship with their animations, but once in a while they'll hit the mark; hence Ice Age. Now this film takes the setting of the ice age and very cleverly executes it with a hint of wittiness and even a hint of emotion. The movie adventures through all these events that happened back then, and makes it funny. We even get the hilarious scene of the Dodo bird extinction. This is what makes the film for me, because they executed this setting very cleverly. The voice acting was pretty good, and the jokes were hit well. But instead of my praising of the film, I have to give it a dosage of my complaints. The characters, although funny, seemed very bland. I know that's saying a lot, because I know lots of people love these characters and their antics, but me? I don't know. They were new and original but I think they could've done something more with them. Maybe it was the plot, where they kind of took a shortcut by placing a baby in there to insert some clichéd jokes. Maybe it was the atmosphere they chose. Or maybe it was the mood I was in when I watched it. Whatever it was, I still enjoyed it and found it to be a great and original animation film, especially for the hit and miss Dream works. Nevertheless, I recommend watching Ice Age.

Somehow, this didn't surprise me.Although it implied some of the violence and death, I found ""Ice Age"" to be unusually cruel. I was especially disturbed by the dodo bird sequence. It was not only historically inaccurate, it was vicious. Good thing they've been extinct since 1681, otherwise, Fox would be shilling out mucho dinero to the dodos and their lawyers. And, the watermelon concern also has grounds for a big-time lawsuit as well.Shamelessly manipulative and paint-by-the-numbers, it's no better than Disney's recent offerings. Manfred's story was an obvious play for our sympathies, but he's not likable to begin with, so it was hard to empathize with him.My hopes were raised when Diego comments that the baby will become a hunter and he might, someday, hunt them! But the film makers didn't have the guts to explore the moral and ethical questions just raised, especially in light of Manfred's story. It reminded me of the soldiers in ""Saving Private Ryan"" discussing the stupidity of 8 guys risking their lives to save one then the issue being dropped: it was patronizing and insulting.And why did they add on that coda?

In this film we see more then just the usual fart and slapstick humour and begin to see jokes about their actual situation and while it does have most of the jokes aimed at kids, the jokes are fresh enough that adults will respect the experience as well.Second, this film has a great back up of not only a good storyline and animation but all the voice actors support each other beautifully and help add quite a style to this movie that also adds to its enjoyability.Overall, the film is funny and has many enjoyable moments.

The first Fox Studios entry was this one, Ice Age, a funny movie following Manfred the Mammouth (Ray Romano) and Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) as they go the wrong way during the seasonal migration. Manfred has always been an outcast in this chilly society, and Sid just annoys everyone to the point that he's out there by himself as well. The plot takes off when Manfred and Sid find a baby human after saber-tooth tigers attack an early man settlement. Manfred and Sid decide to take the baby back to the humans. One problem is that one of the attacking saber-tooths, Diego (Denis Leary), travels with them, his motivations unclear. The movie follows the traveling party in mainly good cheer and with outstanding animation. The scene where the party slides through an ice shield is especially effective. Ice Age is a good movie that has funny moments, lead mostly through the comedic chemistry that exists between Romana, Leguizamo, and Leary. However, when compared to the Shrek movies, the overall laugh-out-loud humor just does not measure up. However, that is not to say Ice Age is a bad movie, it's just not as good as the contemporary gold standards. The animation, however, is top notch, even the humans, though have their own style, look good enough to do well. Ice Age is quality entertainment, just not to the level of Shrek.",Ice Age
139,Gunn,An Animated film for All ages!,9,7 May 2009,"One of the truly finest examples of animation in the new age of computer animated films. This little film has it all, a very funny script, delightful characters, a perfect cast of voice actors, fantastic animation, a terrific score by David Newman, poignant scenes and a sweet story of animals trying to survive the ice age. Ray Romano does a great job as Manny the Mammoth, John Leguizamo is fine as Sid the Sloth, Dennis Leary is perfect as Diego the fierce sabre tooth tiger who learns the meaning of friendship and the character of Skrat the wacky squirrel, voiced by director Chris Wedge, steals every scene he's in and becomes a star. The plot involves an unlikely trio of animals trying to deliver a lost human child back to his tribe. Kudos to all the animators, artists, technicians and everyone else involved in this wonderful film.",Ice Age
140,patrick_dunne,Ica Age doesn't disappoint,8,20 October 2005,"Ice Age is a prehistoric film about a mammoth (Manny), a fast-moving sloth* (Sid) and a saber-tooth tiger (Diego) trying to return a human baby back to its ""tribe."" Manny is a rouge mammoth migrating the opposite way of other mammoths. Sid is caring (but stupid) and wants to return the baby and hangs with Manny, seeking protection. Diego promises to kill the baby behind the others back because the baby's father has killed more than half of his pack.So, the odd group travels, fighting many obstacles and trying to reach the group of humans. There is not much of a plot, but this film has a great sense of humor and fun for the family. It is more of stupid funny, but funny nonetheless. The characters and the setting are unique, which makes this film more enjoyable. What is also strange is that the humans don't talk, but the animals do. As odd and funny as the trio starring in this film, Ice Age is one of my favorite Pixar films. Pixar has done a great job on this film and I really think it is fantastic.Great movie.*A man walking moves over 26 times faster than a sloth.8 /10",Ice Age
141,TuckMN,Great fun for everyone that has a sense of humour.,9,14 May 2002,"With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $60 million the people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job.They have combined state-of-the-art digital animation, the perfectly cast voice talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a highly entertaining, family film with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and caring for your fellow herd members. And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd.While watching this film I got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders!David Newman -- yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and, at times, is positively toe tapping.The overall look of the film is incredible; an intensely coloured, strangely believable fantasyland of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. The individual characters were delightfully believable too, with the facial expressions of Ray Romano's Manfred' being a particular treat.The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `Dumb as a DoDo comes from.'This is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless.It would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home.",Ice Age

143,FeverDog,THREE MAMMALS AND A BABY? Exactly.,5,8 October 2003,"I didn't think much ICE AGE. Never mind the drab visual look or the predictable plot.  What annoyed me was its unrealized premise.I dunno, but why do these animals need to speak? Disregard, as I have, the fact that English wasn't around when the movie was set. What bothered me was the laziness of the scriptwriters. Wouldn't the movie be more creative if the animals didn't speak at all? How about telling the story through their own means - with body language and grunts and whatnot. What's the point in making a movie about animals if all you're gonna do is supply them with recognizable human characteristics? Sure, it'd be terribly difficult to make this movie without dialogue, but it'd be possible right? Think of all the money to be saved without hiring B-list actors to supply the voices.This would also eliminate another gripe I had - the anachronistic dialogue. At one point Manfred spoke of a ""petting zoo."" Would zoos have been in existence at the time the movie takes place, much less the petting variety? Another quip had to do with a slalom; I don't believe any form of sport exist back then, especially not a sophisticated zigzag skiing type. 
I guess I'm too hard on these kiddie movies. I still haven't figured out exactly what Stuart Little is (a mouse, or a boy who looks like a mouse? And why doesn't his family treat him as such? Are they blind, or just stupid?), so maybe I should stop watching them.",Ice Age

However, one of them has a hidden ulterior motive..I remember that I watched this movie twice in theaters in 2002. I was laughing like there was no tomorrow when this was out. Granted, I was quite young- about 7-years-old or so. The good memories that I had of this film were what pushed me to re-watch the trilogy. :)Re-watching the film now, I can see that the story line was a bit too simple. Just fit for a kids film. If I was still the 7-year-old me that had watched this years ago, I would have given this an instant 10.

148,MUFCOK,"A film I watched countless times, which I then re-watched years later only to find it less enjoyable than I remembered.",8,21 July 2015,"Ice Age is a good movie, there is no doubt about that. As with most popular animation flicks, it appeals to all ages and has a decent enough mix of humour to keep all the family entertained. I loved Ice Age growing up and have memories of it being one of the favourite animated movies of all time. Having re-watched it at weekend, 7 or 8 years after previously viewing it, I felt a little flat. Sid seriously carries the film, many of the jokes and the majority of the dialogue comes through him. The supporting cast all do a pleasant job, Manny is entertaining and they do share some good chemistry but the film relies heavily on Sid's presence.I couldn't help but compare Ice Age to two very famous animated movies. The relationship between Sid and Manny and the unlikely relationship that they develop is reminiscent of Shrek and Donkey. The way they take care of the baby, taking him into their tribe, naming him Pinky and looking after him and getting emotionally attached as they search for his parents, reminded me too much of Monsters Inc. I don't know how I didn't see these comparisons in the past but upon recent viewing they were far too blindly obvious.With a run time of less than 1 hour 20 minutes, Ice Age really struggles with the pacing. It takes 20 or so minutes to introduce all the characters and get the plot in order then it flies through the next hour! We see scenes which could have added a little more depth - the drawings of Mammoths on the cave wall for example, this was brushed aside very quickly which I thought was a shame. I personally think Ice Age could have benefited with being 15-20 minutes longer.With the negatives that I have mentioned above being considered, I still think Ice Age is a very good film! It is funny, feel good, caring and creative. An aspect that I especially liked was that the animals didn't have a home, they weren't based anywhere, it was essentially a road trip. They moved from place to place, out of their comfort zone with only each other for support and guidance. I appreciated the message behind the story and enjoyed how the movie panned out as it progressed. The on screen relationship between Sid and Manny is very well done and Diego is a decent enough addition to the group. The story is pleasant if not a little clichéd and the comedy is a decent mix of slapstick and subtle humour. This is certainly the strongest film in the Ice Age franchise and certainly worth a watch!8/10",Ice Age
149,mweston,3 stars,7,5 April 2002,"The humans have (unseen, before the film opens) killed a sabertooth tiger, and the tigers want revenge, so they plot to kidnap a human baby. Diego (voice by Denis Leary) is charged with this task, and he partially succeeds, but finds himself sharing three-way custody of the baby with a woolly mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo), who rightly don't trust Diego alone with the baby. Manny and Sid want to return the baby to the humans and Diego agrees, although he secretly has other plans. All of this occurs as the ice age is beginning and almost all animals are migrating south. Interspersed with this main story we occasionally see a hapless sabertooth squirrel thingy trying valiantly (and painfully) to find somewhere to hide the acorn he has found. Besides the squirrel there are a number of other very fun bits, such as dodo birds performing ""Tae Kwon-Dodo"" and showing why they became extinct, as well as references to Star Trek and Titanic.The animation is not as polished or flashy as in Shrek or Monsters, Inc., but it might be a little more human. On the whole, I definitely enjoyed this film and would recommend it, but the story which holds the brilliant bits together is pretty obvious and a little too precious to let it measure up to the high standards set by other recent animated films.",Ice Age

An interesting and cheerful comedy that makes you laugh. The plate tectonics is explained and presented very well- though in the most dumb manner...haha. A wonderful adventure fantasy that will make you smile, no matter what your age or tastes are.
A story that describes the importance of a family and concern irrespective of differences. Also, this is friendship and sacrifice that build trust as represented in Diego changing sides. And an interesting fact- men in this series can't talk animals can!!

When I saw it at the theater, it was really good, much better than I ever would've expected.The animation is quite stunning. The story is good too, with plenty of good points about working in a team and overcoming hardships together as one.This is often compared to Shrek, while I think that Shrek is an entirely different type of movie. Even though the sloth in this movie does kind resemble the chatterbox donkey in Shrek, the two films are much different. Both films have great animation. The animation in Shrek is more colorful, while in Ice Age there is snow everywhere, so the main ground color is white.I'm sure most kids will enjoy Ice Age, even the 13 year olds will probably enjoy it too. People in the age area between 14 and 16 might think other wise.This is great, it is thrilling, enjoyable, and has a good meaning deep inside.

The story, despite (just in my pointless opinion) its lack of decent humor (while there are some occasional chuckles), has enough touching moments and action to make it an excellent diversion for audiences. The animation is very well done by 2002 standards, utilizing the help of brand new rendering technology that can render minute details like fur very well (despite how in some areas, it was still quite primitive, such as dug-up ice not leaving holes where it came from). The characters aren't exactly funny: rather, they're touching, cold, dark, and overall characters that will be appreciated or depreciated for the right reasons. Despite having some references that are obviously out-of-place in its timeline (including possible foreshadowing in the cave scenes), it sums up to one of the better animated movies of 2002. It isn't Lilo and Stitch, but a view is as warranted as an Ice Age migration (which may come soon).",Ice Age

Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie.A gorgeous color palette (man, this looks good) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make this a big winner. The opening 3-4-minute scene with ""Scat,"" is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him. ""Sid"" the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the movie. He usually has something funny to say throughout the movie.Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tigerThis isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice, sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters.

Ice Age is a nice movie, and I think it was worth seeing in theaters.  Maybe one of the main reasons I went to see it was the previews for Spirit and Star Wars Episode II, but those are different matters.Ice Age follows a trio of buddies out to save a child, even though he is the human son of a hunter.The plot is not bad, but poorly develops as we are led into the life of Sid the Sloth, a slow, annoying, yet likeable character who is left behind during migration.  He pals up with Manfred the Mammoth after the big wooly creature saves his life from two angry rhinos.The characters are pretty well-developed except for Diego and the humans in the clan.  But the humans play a minor role, so we don't need to know much about them.The execution of the movie is great.  Sid and Manfred team up with Diego to get through the ice and find the human clan, but Diego has his own plans.  I won't go any further.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes animated movies and can overlook some childish flaws.  The humor is satisfying in most (but not all) areas, the characters are deep, the plot isn't bad, and the storyline follows a solid stream of events that will entice you to continue watching.Also, the music isn't bad in some places.  Especially in the ice cavern when they're racing along on the ice... hilarious!",Ice Age

They didn't talk at all through the whole movie. What's up with that? On the other hand, the story is fairly good. I like the humor of Manfred, the giant mammoth, (voiced by Ray Ramano) and Sid, the dumb sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo). Diego was a good character too, voiced by Denis Leary. (who also voices Francis the male ladybug in ""A Bug's Life."") The finding and returning the human ""baby"" though, is a little typical. Why must it always be a ""find and rescue"" type of thing?"" Though, ""Finding Nemo"" is an example of a great ""search and rescue"" -type movie.The humans were poorly animated, and as I said before, look like half-apes and half-human. We all should know by now that evolution is still an unproven theory. It's 100% theory, nothing more.""Ice Age"" is not among my Top 30, nor will it ever will be.

If this sound like a Disney film, it is(only made through 20th Century Fox). The trailer to the movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, but the movie doesn't live to the expectation the trailer set. The problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film didn't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film. Yes, there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but  the film is mostly aimed at children.

Certainly it was a lot more enjoyable than Shrek (to me) and perhaps even Monsters, Inc. even though it might not quite match the technical achievements of either of those films.  I just found the simple story that much more engaging and fun.  Also, it's set in a more interesting environment than either movie (in my opinion, of course).  I expected there to be a barrage of fart jokes in the film but was utterly amazed by the complete absence of them.  Well, there *are* two instances involving ""poop"" but these are by no means gratuitous and have a lot to do with the development of the characters; moreover, they are actually quite funny.  All the voice work was great, especially (again, surprisingly) that of John Leguizamo, whom I expected to be annoying, but as it turned out, the Sloth stole every scene he was in.

This is the kind of film that the whole family can enjoy.It's not just hilarious in places, but it is also very emotional at some points. I don't want to spoil anything, but you find out later in the film why the mammoth is so moody, and by the end of the film, you will have discovered that he is indeed the strongest character of the bunch.This film may not have been a ground-breaker when it was released, but it certainly has set a standard few have been able to match since.Scrat, the Izzardesque squirrel can make you squirt cola out of your nose in laughter, with his constant misfortune, and hilarious predicament.Overall, this is a film, you'll want to watch over and over again.

163,thousandisland,Excellent.,10,2 April 2002,"Ice Age is a wonderful film.  The main characters are so lovable and developed (a rarity in film these days.) that you can't help but be engaged and totally absorbed in their adventures.  The key to good film isn't plot, story or effects.  It isn't even good animation.  It's CHARACTER, and this film's got that in spades.  There are also deep and emotional messages about family and friendship, morality and betrayal.  Contrary to what you may read in some reviews, this film is not for little kids.  It is totally adult in feel and execution, full of maturity and perspective.   The humor is a great touch, even the ""poop"" humor, because it is dealt with in a sophisticated, adult way, not a Shrek-Ohh!-Someone farted!-That's so FUNNY!-way.  I would know because I HATE childish ""humor"" like that. Movies like Dr. Dolittle 2 make me want to walk out. It ISN'T funny.  It is just stupid and talks down to the audience as though we're all fourth graders.  What IS funny is three Prehistoric beasts arguing about who is going to look at the ""baby thing"" the baby is wearing and be the ""poop checker""... These are adult animals having to deal with a human baby, and that is just plain funny, especially when they conclude from it that ""humans are disgusting.""   To put a scene like this even NEAR the immaturity of Shrek's is unbelievable.   One is realistic and reflective, the other is just rubbish from some writer with a six year-old mentality.     ""Ice Age"" is light years beyond Shrek in its approach to real themes like death, loss and sacrifice, and all of it is carried off with perfect results.  There are a couple of very brief moments where the emotion is excessive, but it is so meaningful that this is hardly a complaint.   The story is wonderful and, unlike other great films like The Lion King, the quality of the humor and emotion is uniform to the very end.  I love this film because it is full of terrific dialogue.. The characters discuss everything with absolute honesty and realism, which rounds out all their personalities and provides lots of humor.  I went into this movie thinking it was going to be awful-- (Hearing things like, ""If you liked Shrek, you'll love Ice Age"" only confirmed my dread.)  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Ice Age was amazing and moved me to laughter and tears, and I'm going to see it again today.  If you're a big Shrek fan, you might not like Ice Age.  But if you like an adult movie with a great, emotional story and rich characterization, I highly recommend ""Ice Age."" My score: 9.8",Ice Age

Scrat is cool! And so are the rest of the Sub Zero Heroes.The animation is superb. Your heart really goes out to the characters in this film. They have good lines of dialogue and are well developed. It's hard to say which one really steals the picture.I experienced their journey with laughter, tears and amazement. Nothing was forced or over done. The emotion was genuine, especially in the dramatic second half. The last film to affect me this deeply was Anastasia in 1997, also a Fox Production. And before that it was The Land Before Time 1988.

Although the animals have more screen impact than the humans, this does not mean Roshan & his tribe are badly done. On the contrary I liked the way they were animated. Several people have remarked that they are unrealistic but I don't see the problem. Photo realism is not what I'm looking for in animation. In any case they look better than the humans in Toy Story.Roshan is cute and I love watching him interact with Sid, Manny & Diego. Sid falls for him immediately and they treat each other like siblings, sometimes fighting, sometimes just having fun. Manny is like a grumpy uncle at first but is soon won over by the baby's charms. The scene where Roshan hugs him is adorable. Even Diego gradually weakens. It is these relationships that make the film such a success.Roshan's parents and tribe only have a small part to play, but an important one too. The ending is beautifully done and no one can fail to be moved. It's just a shame that such a magnificent film wasn't longer. (The same is true for The Land Before Time.

It is typical animated light entertainment, in which an unlikely group of animals team up (for a variety of different reasons) after they find a baby human. This plot gimmick is, for grown-ups anyway, rather contrived, but who cares? This is, first and foremost, a kid's movie, and it borrows heavily from the classic Disney animated films in that it features a veritable menagerie of interesting and offbeat animal characters whose interactions manage to transcend an otherwise implausible story. This is by no means a great film, nor even a great animated film, nevertheless it is entirely satisfying way to spend an hour and a half, especially when you're stuffed into the back of a DC-10 late at night out in the middle of the Pacific. 6/10",Ice Age

The only real differences between the two movies are that Ice Age is CGI and it has a more ""adult"" attitude, which it lifted from Pixar and ""Shrek.""Still, I wasn't bored by it, despite the almost constant white.  6 out of 10.",Ice Age

171,Growlyted,Heartwarming. Brilliant animation & characters.,10,13 March 2004,"While most 3D films (""Toy Story"", ""Shrek"" for example) have left me cold due to the emphasis on visuals or tasteless humour, Ice Age matches the warmth of ""The Land Before Time"" the best 2D ever made. The hyperactive, unfortunate, Scrat sets the tone right at the start. Then we meet the melancholy Manny, the irresponsible Sid, the scheming Diego & the charming Roshan (or Pinkey as they call him.) They're all uniquely lovable & you root for them to succeed. The animation itself is awe inspiring. I especially liked the cave painting sequence, Scrat's intro & the lava bridge. There are some real tear jerker moments & others of pure comedy. The supporting characters, especially the rhinos & dodos, flesh out the story nicely. There's no offensive humour & is clearly aimed to entertain, whatever your age. The soundtrack was unfortunately not released but that's great too. The casting couldn't be better. I look forward to the sequel. 10/10",Ice Age
172,lucianomarzo92,Great Animation,7,5 July 2009,"I first saw this movie in theaters when I was a kid. Since then I have probably watched this movie 6 times. It was worth it each time. This movie is so much fun. Ice Age is great for kids but should not be watched by them only. It has a charm that can appeal to older audiences unlike some animated movies. These other animated movies are still good but don't always hold the interest of the older folks. Ice Age is fun for the whole family! It also has a fairly speedy pace, and the movie is not filled with the main characters singing the soundtrack constantly. The sequel was also very good! I have not seen Ice Age 3 yet but am looking forward to seeing it soon.",Ice Age
173,SwingBatta,"Heartwarming, comical ""Ice"" is one for the ages",10,2 April 2002,"""Ice Age,"" which could have been alternatively titled ""Three Mammals and a Baby,"" is the smartest and most entertaining animated movie since 2000's ""Chicken Run."" It's an intellectual winner that will prove gratifying for both children and adults, and it's the first great film of a year otherwise marred by rubbish like ""All About the Benjamins"" and ""Resident Evil."" There's just something about small-studio-produced, anthropomorphized animals that does the trick every time.Then again, considering my name, I probably would've been hard-pressed to dislike this movie in the first place.Manfred, a huge, aloof woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), is clearly uninterested in tagging along with an assembly of prehistoric creatures who are migrating south to escape the oncoming Ice Age. Before he knows it, he is thrust into an unexpected and unwelcome position of playing bodyguard to a good-natured yet incompetent sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo), when the latter angers a pair of rhinos after inadvertently ruining their dinner in a most unpleasant manner. Meanwhile, Diego (Denis Leary), a revenge-minded sabertooth tiger, has the task of kidnapping a human baby from a tribe who have killed and reduced his pack to the brink of extinction, but his plan of attack fails and the baby disappears from the fracas. Later, Manfred and Sid are shocked to see this little pink thing wash up at their feet on a riverbank, still alive. Though distrustful of one another, the threesome reluctantly put their agendas aside and join forces in order to try to return the child to his family. It's a race against time as they try to succeed in their quest before the Ice Age destroys them all.
Considering that this is a computer-generated film, there's no element of surprise in the animation. But ""Ice Age,"" directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, has something that sets it apart from its brethren. It's oddly reminiscent of the immortal Looney Tunes cartoons, due to its old-school slapstick. Throughout the picture, a feisty little critter named Scrat (so called because he's part squirrel and part rat) tries constantly in vain to bury his beloved acorn. His first attempt - pounding it into solid ice - sets off one heck of an avalanche. Scrat's continuous failed attempts to bury that darned acorn resemble Wile E. Coyote's vain pursuits of the Roadrunner. The aforementioned avalanche scene, in which two icy mountain ranges collide with each other and nearly crush our diminutive protagonist, is a blast. The resulting ""uh-oh"" expression on his little face, upon realizing his grave mistake, is priceless; you almost expect him to whip out that tiny umbrella and cower beneath it. (He also features in a hilarious tag scene at the film's conclusion.) When characters go flying into a snowbank, they leave their silhouette-shaped imprints in their wake. Diego and Manfred continuously knock Sid on the noggin simply for the baby's amusement. ""Ice Age"" even contains a unique and spectacular take on the chase scene, courtesy of what looks like a frozen waterslide hidden deep in a cave.As was the case with ""Chicken Run,"" this film's centerpiece is its superb voice acting. With a trio of venerable comedians cast in the leading roles, the chance was there for them to ham it up and try to outdo each other. Instead, their performances are considerably restrained and they mesh together well, resulting in near-impeccable comic timing. Romano brings the right touch of endearing grouchiness as Manfred, but without becoming a completely miserable sourpuss. Leguizamo's high-pitched voice, coupled with a Cindy Brady-type lisp, is perfect for the cowardly and lovable Sid, while Leary, one of the greatest - and most ribald - stand-up comics ever, is all easygoing attitude as shady Diego, who may or may not have something to hide. Their voices fit the characters in the tradition of Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny or Elmer Fudd; it's hard to imagine anyone else in these roles.It doesn't hurt that their bestial counterparts are so darn cute and well developed either. Sure, Diego's mission is to abduct the baby and bring him to the leader of his pack (voiced by Goran Visnjic), but viewers will discover that it's near impossible to feel any animosity towards him. His character is hurt slightly by predictability, but that doesn't make him any less enjoyable. Manfred is pretty much a Neanderthal Lou Grant in terms of his take on the familiar surly-on-the-outside and soft-on-the-inside disposition, but he doesn't whine constantly about it. He doesn't expect anyone's sympathy. The oddly proportioned Sid steals the show, from his funny backside-swinging strut to his personality as a timid little sloth with a heart of gold; no one is more dedicated to returning the baby safely back to his home. There is a hysterical scene where poor Sid sits in the pouring rain while trying futilely to build a fire, or when he entertains some girlfriends in a prehistoric Jacuzzi (in this case, a tar pit). But while ""Ice Age"" succeeds at tickling the funny bone, it's not all mindless fun and games. There is one emotional moment when our three heroes look at a series of cave paintings, including one featuring a mammoth family - mother, father, and child - which transforms into a beautifully animated yet melancholy sequence showing a horrible human slaughter of the family, as seen through Manfred's perspective. He feels a spiritual connection to the baby after the death of his own. Not since Gandalf's demise in ""Lord of the Rings"" have I teared up during a movie, which, needless to say, is something I don't do very often. It's a rarity when a film causes viewers to believably experience different emotions without feeling forced to do so.""Ice Age"" succeeds in various ways where ""Shrek,"" to which it has drawn many comparisons to, fails. How remarkable is this film? It may mark the first time that the toilet humor contains actual humor. The stiff partnership between Manfred and Sid is parallel to the relationship between Shrek and Donkey, only it's much more amusing. There's no juvenile or crude humor, nor are there any unnecessary potshots aimed at its competition or hypocritical morals preached to the audience, such as the rampant don't-judge-someone-until-you-know-them ethics in ""Shrek"" that were wedged in between the short jokes. The film's only real weakness is an insignificant sequence involving an army of dodo birds, but it's no more abhorrent than watching frogs and snakes being grossly inflated into balloon animals. And, there are no bloody ""Matrix"" spoofs to be seen anywhere.After a string of disappointments like ""Anastasia"" and ""Titan A.E.,"" Fox's beleaguered animation department has finally broken the jinx with this comic delight, and you can do likewise with ""Ice Age"" if you've already lost hope for the 2002 movie season. 9/10",Ice Age
174,ayric,Beats Dreamworks,8,28 November 2002,"In contrast to Dreamworks, Fox try to follow the Disney recipe in their first CGI attempt. And they do so with great success. Where Dreamworks have failed, Fox succeeds straight away to make a film with great warmth and fabulous humor. The animation is not as good as Pixar's and the story is not as well-plotted as Disney's, but other than that this is great fun. I think it also contains the first gay couple (prehistoric rhinos) in animated children's film history. The sabre squirrel is worth the ticket alone.Rating - 8/10",Ice Age
175,San Franciscan,"Well, what do you know? 20th Century Fox DID it!",10,16 March 2002,"I went to see ""Ice Age"" out of curiosity and boredom only. I thought, ""What the heck, let's go see it."" I didn't have terribly big hopes for it and just thought it would be merely a slightly passable hit which would be mildly successful because of the lack of animated films otherwise out in theaters at the time of this writing.But what do you know? The great news is that 20th Century Fox has managed to pull a winner out of its bag on their very first outing!Although the plot won't win any huge awards for originality, it's beside the point: the fun here is with the wildly zany, energetic direction that the film takes in getting from A to B. Unlike the horrendous ""Shrek"", which was basically a bunch of childish gross-out jokes attached to an extremely juvenile attempt to mock Disney (which was so limp that it ended up being the motion picture equivalent of scribbling dirty pictures and wisecracks all over a bully's photo in his high school yearbook), this one is guaranteed to appeal to ALL ages and not just those who haven't yet outgrown the buttcrack/fart stage. This is because ""Ice Age"" is written with a very adult, sly and sophisticated sense of humour that hasn't really seen much of the light of day since the original Looney Tunes creations, gags which grow out of situations and personality as well as clever animation--NOT just cheap laughs.The film is blessedly free of the trendy gross outs that prevails excuses for modern family comedy today. There are only three gags here (which I won't give away) which mildly approach that area--but they work because of the attitude behind them. Let me give you an idea by saying this: the stupid gross outs in ""Shrek"" were created by people would thought that the offensive bodily actions THEMSELVES were funny. By sharp comparison, the three in this film are funny not because of what they are, but because of the identifiable situations they are PLACED in. There's a huge difference, one that frat crowds tend to be all too late to realize until they hit the emotional equivalent of puberty.I'd be tempted to say that it was created as a tribute to the now-late Chuck Jones if it weren't for the fact that it's been in the works since long before his death. I say this because it pays such a huge and loving tribute to the classic WB studio. It's no coincidence that the little squirrel-like character who spends all his time trying to hide an acorn is created with a facial structure and expressions which are almost identical to Wile E. Coyote's.And speaking of facial expressions...well, the ones here put ""Shrek"" to shame. They are wild, cartoony and even manage to outdo the emotions expressed in even Pixar's creations. This film KNOWS it's a computer-animated cartoon as opposed to a computer-animated ""feature film"", so it goes for broke with fantastic exaggerations that would do the Old School proud. Even its gorgeous backgrounds refuse to take themselves too seriously, sporting a cartoonish surrealism that echoes Maurice Noble.My only complaint is that, as with ""Shrek"" and the Pixar films, the people STILL tend to look awfully plastic. But that's such a minor quibble concerning this film, because its only main concern is to provide audiences with the best time watching a comedy that they've seen all winter. And it succeeds terrifically.Take the kids, take your parents--heck, take your grandmother. Everyone will get a kick out of this gem.(NOTE: Why slap a PG rating on a film that has virtually nothing any more objectionable in it than Disney's current G-rated animated features?)",Ice Age
176,HBeachBabe,silly and entertaining,7,17 March 2002,"This was a fun movie. It's perhaps more ""silly"" and kid oriented than some other recent computer animated films like Shrek or Monsters Inc. which work on 2 levels.  The majority of humor here is physical, reminiscent of early Looney Toons cartoons or even Three Stooges style violence-as-humor horsing around.  The kids in the theater with me seemed to enjoy it.  The only concession to adult-level humor appeared to be a Pumbaa & Timon inspired possibly-gay rhino couple.The message is pretty basic, involving standing by your friends, but that still didn't stop it from being fun.  And despite the carnivore vs. plant eater premise, and the humorous violence, the actual level of violent threat was minimal, with only one real death and that being off screen.The animation style was interesting, looking more like claymation than computer. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. The surfaces looked smooth and realistically 3D. Like it was a physical object, but the blockiness made it clear it wasn't ""real."" But the look worked for the film. It certainly never looked computer created, however it also lacked that level of realism seen in movies like ""Dinosaur.""  These creatures and this world were highly stylized, from the sloth's wide set eyes, to the sabre-tooth's almost disembodied lower jaws.The voice talents of the leads were quite well done, with each actor essentially playing himself (or his well known persona).  Ray Romano, plays the large wooly mammoth Manfred with an arrogance and attitude appropriate for his size, but with an underlying vulnerability and pathos.  John Leguizamo has the enviable role of motormouth sloth, Sid, essentially the comic foil to Romano's straight man (mammoth).  Dennis Leary is rather sedate as Sabre-tooth tiger Diego, toning down his usual hyperactive vocal mannerisms to a more kid-friendly level. His seems to be the only character who's appearance was modeled directly from actor.A minor complaint is that aside from a brief opening ""migration"" sequence featuring a number of humorous prehistoric mammals, strange enough in appearance to rival any dinosaur (my personal favorites are the glyphodons, early ancestor's to modern armadillos), there are no female characters. This is a story for the boys, again reinforcing the Three Stooges style silliness.A film the kids will love and parents will be able to sit through without squirming.  Depending on your tolerance for silliness, you may even enjoy it.",Ice Age

178,Figaro-8,Cool ICE AGE gets a warm reception.,10,15 March 2002,"Fox has had a hard time with animated features.  ANASTASIA did moderately well; TITAN AE did not.  But with ICE AGE, they may finally have their foot firmly in the door.The animation:  Okay, maybe Blue Sky won't dethrone Pixar or PDI anytime soon.  But make no mistake, ICE AGE is a visual marvel still.  It fits the story perfectly:  alternately cartoonish and detailed when it needs to be. (It's not ALWAYS necessary to see every strand of hair on a creature's body.)Voices and characters:  One of the best things about the film.  The characters are quite memorable, and the vocal performances are great. Others have objected to Ray Romano's performance as Manfred the mammoth, but I felt that his deadpan delivery was just right to portray the strong, yet emotionally wounded loner.  Denis Leary makes Diego a cool cat, whether he's bad or good.  But the best vocal performance goes to John Leguizamo, who is simply hilarious as Sid.  He makes Sid immediately endearing rather than irritating.And then there's Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel whose antics with an acorn open, close, and serve as the transitional elements of the film. He's a miniature Wile E. Coyote to his acorn's Road Runner.  You know he's gonna get it, but you just gotta cheer for--and laugh at--the guy.But the success of a film ultimately comes down to its script.  The trailers make this film out to be hilarious, and it is.  But what a nice surprise to find out there is more to it than mere comedy.  It's a testament to the talents of director Chris Wedge and the writers that you will laugh hard one minute and have a tear in your eye the next.  They also know when dialogue is not needed, which is commendable.ICE AGE has the potential to be a big hit.  It's got one of the best ad campaigns in years, no Disney competition on opening weekend, and on top of that, it has a solid story with endearing characters.  I hope it will be a film for the ages.",Ice Age
179,pmcollectorboy,Funny but brutally straightforward,6,26 March 2002,"Much like Monsters, Inc., I had a really good time watching this movie but felt that something had gone wrong somewhere.First let's start with the good. The jokes are funny and clever and never let up. They're a good combination of the typical verbal humor and the not so typical sight gags. This movie also has one of the longest running gags I've ever seen in an animated movie. The characters are colorful and really know how to tickle your funny bone.Now the bad. The characters fall prey to unconvincing conventions later on in the movie. The story doesn't have the minor plot nitpicks that Monsters, Inc. had, but it's also much more brutally straightforward. Unlike Monsters, Inc., there's really not much point to Ice Age's story. It's there and back again, and you're left wondering ""Um. Yeah.""Even still, Ice Age is a fun knee-slapper that has enough charm and humor to elevate it above Dinosaur. But it lacks the gentle charm combined with zaniness found in The Emperor's New Groove or the craftiness of Chicken Run or Shrek.

It has quirky, funny moments that the kids will enjoy while also maintaining its more serious heartfelt moments and even adult humor that the grownups will appreciate. We get to go on this meaningful journey with our three protagonist, Sid, Diego, and Manny as they attempt to return a lost child to his tribe.

182,yourfavoritecritic,Still Good! Despite Living in the Shadows of its Early-2000's Competition,6,27 June 2021,"Released in 2002, Ice Age, became the eighth CGI feature-length film to be released at that time and was directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha; the film tells the story of a misfit prehistoric group made up of a mammoth, ground sloth and sabre-toothed tiger undertaking the task to return a missing baby to its tribe. Ice Age was met with fairly positive reception from both audience and critics alike and performed well enough at the box office to spawn four sequels and catapult the success of the studio Blue Sky.I grew watching the Ice Age series however after not seeing the films for several years now, I decided to check out the series starting with where it all began. Returning to Ice Age was both nostalgic and interesting to see how this film has aged, with it using technology that hadn't had been perfected at the time much of the animation (though I am sure was good for 2002) has definitely shown its age. Ice Age is by no means unwatchable or ugly to look at, however, it is rough around the edges. One thing that has stayed constant is the humour both due in part to the writing and good voice acting.Starting with the latter, Ice Age primarily features the voices of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary who voice the characters of Manny, Sid and Diego. All of which do a good job in their role, helping to bring some charisma and emotion to their sometimes stiffly animated characters. Without that charm, much of this could have been bogged down and been a product of its time. Although most of the voice acting is serviceable and helps to elevate this film, the overarching story featured in Ice Age is one that is pretty standard for a family movie. However, with the setting of the film, the filmmakers were able to craft some entertaining sequences and touched on moments that I was not expecting for this type of film, with themes of death and loss. Although those moments are surface level and have nothing more to add beyond what is presented on screen, it does provide a layer to Ice Age that helps it to stand out even if it remains in the shadow of its competitors (at the time) like Toy Story or Shrek.In conclusion, it was fun returning to Ice Age and with a runtime under ninety minutes, made it a film that was brisk to get through. Although the animation may be dated and I am unsure how entertaining a film like this would be to today's youth, there were still aspects to Ice Age that I liked. It is a film that, for the most part, has stood the test of time, even if the story is tired and animation isn't as pretty as some CGI films today. If you are someone who is new to the series, the first Ice Age may be a tough sell and I have a hard time flat out recommending it, however, if you are someone, like me, looking to feel some nostalgia Ice Age will definitely provide that; and for that reason, I am giving Ice Age a 6/10.",Ice Age

I found myself laughing with my kids in the theater.

Ice Age is about three prehistoric creatures forming an unlikely friendship over something unexpected. Manny the Mammoth believes himself to be the last mammoth alive (having watched his wife and child lose their lives to the savage human tribes that kill for meat and fur to stay alive) and unwillingly befriends an idiotic sloth named Sid. A group of saber tooth tigers seek revenge on the human tribes for attacking their pack and the leader tells Diego to kill a woman and her baby, and asks that he bring the baby to him alive. The woman flees into a river with the baby, and having washed onto a rock, sees Manny and Sid watching her. She slides the baby before them and disappears into the river. Manny and Sid set out to return the baby to the tribe, and run into Diego who pretends to befriend them in order to steal the baby at the right time.

Although it includes many other animals, the film centres mainly on a charming but vicious sabre-tooth tiger, a lively but irritating sloth and a miserable and cynical mammoth who are forced to join each other in a quest to return a lost human infant back to its tribe.Ice Age is full of brilliant voice work from Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary who all clearly define their animal's characteristics and have excellent chemistry with one and other. This was a must in a film with poor and unrealistic CGI animation that not only gives little effect to the backdrops and landscapes but also gives the characters few facial expressions and emotions.Apart from the main trio, there is also an excellent independent character in Scrat, an acorn- chasing squirrel. Scrat is entirely there to be laughed at and as lightning, an avalanche, and glacier and ice cracking prevent Scrat from his acorns, you can only sit there in hysterics. Although the verbal humour is funny, the physical, slapstick humour can get tiring to watch and most of the 'action' sequences turn out to be somewhat anti-climaxes.

They both have incredibly strong and likable story-lines as well as better characters with more developed personalities. However, 'Ice Age' is able to stand on its own two feet more than comfortably with numerous features such as its humour, its emotional presence and its strong visuals. Impressively, these fine features are consistent throughout the first three films although the fourth appears to be an anomaly in what was an entertaining franchise.When Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) makes an unlikely partnership with Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), they attempt to return a lost child to its family. Sly sabre tooth Diego (Denis Leary) secretly pretends to join forces with the duo however his actual intentions appear to be with his herd.As the audience, you will develop feelings for the characters and bond with them as the duration unfolds.

Denis Leary especially, as Diego the sabertooth-tiger, goes through so much development. As a villain helping the heroes, its impossible to see which way he will turn when the climax comes. And when it does come, you feel as if you have just watched something amazing happen. Ray Romano and John Leguizamo also give immense emotional contributions to the story.

Strong one-liners, some social comments that kids won't understand, the good guys win. One thing more: Scrat. By the way, how does everybody know his name is Scrat? 7/10",Ice Age
193,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 3 out of 5,6,2 March 2003,"Ice Age is the next amusing chapter in the computer-animated family film genre.  Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say it is a rehash of the previous chapters.  It is certainly a fun film, with witty word play and some exciting action sequences, including an ice-slide ride which every child (and probably most adults too) would love to try out.  But one can't help feeling that the story is a little tired through previous overuse.  A group of unlikely acquaintances - this time comprised of a mammoth, a sloth and a sabre-toothed tiger - set out on a quest to return the obligatory lost-but-cute child to his family.The animation is adequate, but nowhere near the high standard set by Monsters, Inc.  This is particularly noticeable with regards to the various animals' fur, which is disappointingly static.  Additionally the background landscapes are very basic and the snow is somehow just too pristine.  Having said that however, the film does have some nice attention to detail, such as the eye tic in Scrat - the acorn-obsessed and incredibly unlucky squirrel. The misadventures of Scrat are the best parts of the movie, and made more impressive by the fact that, as he doesn't speak a single word of dialogue, the humour is entirely visual. There are also nice character touches evident in Manny the mammoth (who has amazingly emotive eyes), and a sequence in which a cave painting comes alive and depicts a tragic scene from his past is very effective.  While an emotional sequence like this gives the movie a heart, its descent at the finale into saccharine sentimentality is somewhat cloying, but will probably satisfy the kids (and anyone else who requires a film to have a happy ending).",Ice Age
194,taikman,"Funny and well made, but not one of the best animated movies.",7,18 June 2002,"I love cartoons. They can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire ('The Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), spectacle ('Aladdin'), or reality  ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in 'Ice Age', such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside, chatting like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch, as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time, it's a really fun film. Sit back, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs.The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth, and Diego, a sabretooth tiger, as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, naturally, they have a whole lot of problems. Also popping up throughout the journey is Scrat, history's unluckiest rodent, who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers, on top of dead trees, in ice-caves. His opening scene is a classic.It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in, but some of the scenes, such as the nappy-changing or the dodos, are hilarious, the animals are likeable and it looks good. There is one quite touching moment too, when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes.Not a must-see, but good for a fun hour or so.7/10",Ice Age
195,Syrchek,Great fun. Presumably the funniest animated film I've seen so far.,8,20 September 2005,"Ice Age is a movie that really focuses on it's characters. I found the way the characters look, move and sound very funny and amazing. It wouldn't be fair to say that they just had some life in them like I did for Madagascar. At times I was so sunk in that I forgot that I was watching invented creatures because they appeared so authentic.I won't give away the story, all I can say is that it's pretty classical but still very worth watching and portraying on the big screen. There's also a pile of fun and imaginative creatures in the movie. But most of all the creators gave great significance to fun and adventure.Surprisingly there's just a handful of movie references which I didn't mind at all. One of the few things I didn't find very good was the action that went a bit overboard at times. Overall this is a very fun animated feature. I'm still quite new in seeing these sort of movies but this one was perhaps the best I've seen so far......... 4/5 ........",Ice Age

I saw it a second time, and I was somewhat bored in the slow scenes.  Sid (the sloth) is not all that flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good in the movie.  The animation is outstanding, and the story has a touching ending.  It is worth taking kids 10 and under to, but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring.  Also, the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting.  Like I said, it is a pretty good movie, but I would rate ""Toy Story 2"" or ""Shrek"" higher. 8/10",Ice Age

199,Theshapeshifter,Nutty and well enjoyed,9,29 December 2006,"This film is one of those in the world of animated movies that just says to folks ""Hey, not all of the great computer animated films out there come from Disney and Dreamworks alone!"" It is simple and yet it is none too shabby either. The story starts off with an unsuspecting little ""Scrat"" (saber-toothed squirrel) trying to store his acorn for the winter, and as he does, is soon in the midst of a great migration of all prehistoric mammals, great and small. Among these creatures a lone mammoth named Manny is shown trying to leave all of the others behind, and soon meeting an oafish ground sloth named Sid. The two travel and soon Sid, who had found a baby human, made a move to try to return this baby to his tribe. Manny, not seeming to care a whit for Sid but having an altruistic attitude, teamed up with him and the two made their way to meet up with a saber-toothed cat known as Diego, who was employed in the finding of the humans, claiming that he could find them. And so through many hardships and goofy antics, the trio now make their way to try and return the baby to his family. With some touching moments showed in this fine little film and some hilarious cartoon-like antics, it is not to be missed by cartoon film patrons in the know.",Ice Age

""cause you have no choice"", how many times did we hear it?) but the characters are funny, the humor of situations is fresh, and the movie more or less flows undisturbed up to the Happy End. If you happen to read my notes both to ""Shrek"" and to ""Monsters Inc"", here's something linking all these three: this movie, albeit marginally less good than ""Monsters"" (see above) has got a hint of the salty humor of ""Shrek"" (the small squirrel mishaps are great).

202,annahudak-70828,So charming!,7,17 May 2021,"What a wonderful movie. Has its animation aged poorly? Absolutely. Has the heart that's permeating through it aged poorly? Not at all. I have seen this movie so many times. It's one of the most important films of my childhood, and yet it's still absolutely hilarious, no matter how many times I see it. I still feel deep emotion everytime I see it. All the characters are so loveable. There's of course the baby, absolutely adorable. The saber-tooth tiger pack which is filled with idiots. There's Sid the sloth, a total idiot who pretty much serves as the movies punching back and also is the main focus of the funniest scene in the movie (playing football against the dodo's) and his lactation joke is absolutely hilarious. Diego, the hunter who is supposed to kill Manny the Mammoth and the baby who is a true adventurer and has some of the best moments in the film. Manny who has been through a lot, is jaded, and wants rid of Sid, and is the master of name-calling and insulting others. Finally, who could forget Scrat? The cause of just about every problem in their world who is incapable of hiding his acorn. It's honestly a perfectly paced movie. Few films pace everything out as well as this movie does. Nothing overstays it's welcome or feels too short. They never overload you on jokes, despite the jokes seemingly coming a million miles per minute at points. If you want a charming movie that will entertain anyone, old or young, watch Ice Age. I highly recommend.",Ice Age
203,GSmith9072,It's average...and immoral,5,18 January 2007,"Maybe a bit below. For me, ""Ice Age"" is what defined the decline of inventive story-telling in the new cgi era. I remember seeing this in theaters. I was thrilled to see it because I was mentally inclined to think that cgi = greatness thanks to the likes of Pixar. Aside from the incorporation of several ""Scrat"" sequences, the film was average average average. I had the thought process of the film fully envisioned in my head after viewing it. The creators needed a unique environment with some animals and chose the ice age. They then invented a very 'Shrek'-esque formula: a tetchy large protagonist is accompanied by a underdog who for no apparent reason insists on joining in on the journey to complete the task that is the conflict of the film. It is however less inspired than ""Shrek"" and the laughs are more sporadic. Well, for me anyway. I must admit that the audience is always driven to giggles over the annoying 'sabre tooth' squirrel thing that suffers in his many pursuits for nuts. I hate it, it's a Looney Tunes rehash. But if the crowd likes, fine. That is actually a merit for the film. The other characters, ""Manny"", ""Sid"" and ""Diego"" are average characters when it comes to personality. Diego is the soon-to-be-redeemed for his evil meat eating ways (as long as he's not human) character who will learn to befriend the annoying sloth and the stubborn Mammoth. Manny will learn to love and respect the small child that falls into his care despite the fact that the child will grow to cause the extinction of Manny's species. Too bad he can't learn to respect the tigers for attempting, like the humans, to live. Nope, the tigers are evil demons. Moving on.Sid is the irritating sidekick. Dorry, Donkey, Mike from ""Monster's Inc"" all come to mind, although most likely it wasn't plagiarized from any of those. He did garner the most laughs aside from ""Scrat"", the infamous squirrel and his nut. The story overall is not very interesting or creative. Some animals find a human child and must return it, finding laughter along the way. The attention is gained from the character's antics (which many have grown to love). If you aren't interested in the characters you'd hate the movie. The overall theme of the film is that meat-eaters should give up meat and magically live while befriending the prey. Also, that animals are reprehensible for causing any kind of discrepancies to the human race in an effort to not be killed for their fur, and that the animals should deal with it. Indeed, a watermelon is ""hilariously"" stolen from some dodo birds for the human and we laugh at the stupid soon-to-be-extinct birds as our heroes effectively steal from them. The film epitomizes the formulaic talking animal genre, for the most part, but the main problem is that it relies on the gimmicks on the comedy and it isn't gut-wrenchingly funny. I had a hard time laughing at the screwed morality. Luckily, as usual, I was the only one who noticed it. What I have left to review is the animation, which for the time was adequate. The film is average, and it needs to get it's problems with the food chain settled out. It caused Ebert to give thumbs up to Disney's ""The Wild"" for paying heed to this issue.",Ice Age
204,Mrswing,the only person in the world to dislike this? Probably,1,26 July 2002,"I disliked Ice Age from the time I first saw the trailer. So when I finally went to see it with my girlfriend to avoid taking her to Blade II, I was not looking forward to it but hoped for the best. Unfortunately my worst fears came true : I didn't like this movie one bit. The main reason is the character design, which I find to be hideous to such a degree that I cannot identify with any of the characters. Sid the Sloth looks yucky (like a really filthy plush toy), the sabre tooth tigre's facial features are just wrong, etc. Only the baby is appealing. I did find myself wondering whether I would have enjoyed the film if I had felt the character design was more attractive, but I doubt it somehow (I liked Shrek's designs but found that to be a big disappointment too, though still better than this). The plot is very predictable, the baby's mother dies but no one cares, the drama is wonky (the sabretooths cannot defeat a single human in their raid on the encampment - which makes them weak as villains - yet the immensely powerful Manny the Mammoth seems to be helpless before them in the finale though he can throw giant brontotheriums through the air with the greatest of ease), the emotional arc doesn't make sense (Manny has lost his wife and child to human hunters - so he finds closure by saving a human baby??? Very noble, but does this make sense? Saving the offspring of those who destroyed your life?), the creation of the bonds between the mismatched 'herd' never really gells, and the humour is to my mind very often forced. And I do not find Scrat's being picked on by fate to be funny in the slightest.However, I know I'm in an absolute minority with this one. I just had to vent... :-)",Ice Age

Even the drawing style had a certain skewed idiosyncracy that was enjoyable. And the required-by-law tearjerking heartstring-pulling scene was done with a subtlety, delicacy and tastefulness that was nothing short of great, in addition to passing over the heads of the tiniest audience members so as not to give them existential angst beyond their ability to handle.Really well done.

Some of this reluctance is due to my love of the CG animated film Shrek.  But I wish now that I had seen this film on the big screen as it is a really magnificently done film, considering it was a first effort by Blue Sky Studios and Fox.The acting was brilliant and very very believable.  The animation was some of the best CG stuff that I have seen yet.  The story was well written and contained a very good and solid plot that never left the audience feeling that the movie had bogged down.  The movie contains many scenes which have double entendres and inuendos that are definitely geared for a mature audience but are so well disguised that the average young viewer is not going to pick up on them in the double meaning in which they were intended. 
Two very emotional and touching moments occurred in the film that were much warmer than hardly any film I have seen live action or animated in a long time.  All in all, I would have to say that this is one of the best films that I have seen come out in a long time.  In addition, since I saw the film for the first time on a DVD format, I would also have to comment on the content of the DVD.  Absolutely breathtaking and in many ways as funy and entertaining as the film itself.

How could you not laugh at one of his opening lines... ""They migrated without me... they do this EVERY YEAR!!""

The animated movie makes you want to like it so much, despite not being perfect. The film pours out creative energy and slapstick high jinks for the entire 90 minutes. This computer animated movie doesn't miss a beat in terms of visual style. A ice sliding sequence is especially impressive. The story, meanwhile, revolves around a sloth (John Leguizamo) named Sid, Manfred the mammoth (Ray Romano) and Diego (Dennis Leary) a tiger. The group of animals are trying to return a baby to its tribe after he ends up away from them following a Sabertooth tiger attack. ""Ice Age"" reminds one of the classic Warner Brother's Wile E. Coyote cartoons. Scrat, a wide-eyed, prehistoric squirrel provides some truly funny moments in a desperate attempt to open up a nut. Despite, the strengths of some funny slapstick comedy and solid voice characterizations, the film does feel tad too familiar. Computer animation provided cinema with some terrific films the past two to three years including: ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Shrek"". The animation, while still impressive, does have that ""been there, done that"" touch to it. The film contains moments of obvious sappiness and overall is not quite as original as the wide range of humor displayed in ""Shrek"". Yet, all that being said, ""Ice Age"" delivers the goods.

It had style but VERY little substance with a forced morality lesson in tow.I really don't understand why everyone was so jazzed about this movie. Maybe they were voting based on how well their kids liked it. As an adult, I was personally rather bored.I only gave it a 5 because of the technical wizardy of the CG.Well, since I'm forced to put in at least 10 lines, I'll also say that Ray Romano is talentless and continues to play the same character no matter what he does.

231,lschmalz,Good Family Fare,9,23 March 2002,"Kudos to writers, Michael J. Wilson and Michael Berg, who have given us a unique and cleverly written film that will appeal to anyone over four. The story revolves around two misfit characters, a depressed giant wooly mammoth, and an obnoxious, irritating sloth who has been rejected by his family. They meet as one heads south to escape the ""ice age"" and the other is heading north to escape life. A friendship of sorts ensues and then strengthens when they find a baby boy and decide to try to find its parents. Trouble ensues when they meet up with a tiger who tags along with them under pretense of concern for the child, while secretly imagining it as breakfast. This is simply a downright funny movie, filled with clean comedy, slapstick, lots of action and the sweetness that we adore in Disney films. Some scenes are very poorly digitally mastered however, which distracts from the film, and for this reason alone I deducted a point. Despite that fact, however, this film should appeal to anyone age 4 and above, and I do recommend it as a good family outing..",Ice Age

The movie wasn't bad, necessarily, but it wasn't great either.  The voice acting was quite good, especially Denis Leary, and most of the jokes were pretty humorous, but thats about where it stops.  The plot was quite thin, even for a comedy, with a sickeningly sweet sentimental ending.  The movie was pretty slow paced, with long period of not much happening.  The animation was average at best, with the human characters looking especially bad.  The animation in this film to that of ""Monster, Inc."" or even ""Shrek"" and you will see where I am coming from.

So, I went to the theatre having so-so expectations, and I walked out smiling. But... now I look at it today, and occasionally I find myself reaching for a tissue. The story is so well told that I found myself laughing at most of Sid's antics, and Scrat's, which have never gotten old for this movie by the way... ever. But, now being old enough to understand, I also found that the implied, but still tragic, death of Manny's family being revealed is one of the saddest moments in this beautifully animated film.

The writers demonstrate a certain gleeful unpredictablity in the plot and jokes, but the audience enjoys being gulled and deceived, and all ages seemed to appreciate it in the crowded theater in which I saw it.Oh, and give an acorn to a frantic rodent, would you?Four out of five stars.",Ice Age

Carefully timed and executed references to things that adults would recognize elicited well deserved giggles and chuckles from the moms and dads, leaving children wondering what the fun is all about.  But, in the next scene, the never failing smash into the wall leaving an outline cutout had those kids rolling with laughter.  Overall, I do think it sits well with all ages.

It's perfect for kids but not really for anyone over 10. It is not comparable with any of the ""Toy Story"" movies or even Monsters Inc. to a lesser extent which all work on so many levels... for both kids and adults. Shrek blows it out of the water. Just don't bother, get it out for the kids if you want them to be distracted for 90mins or so. Otherwise just stick with Pixar!

248,ccm043,"Very Funny Movie. A lot better than ""Robots""",8,19 May 2005,"This is an extremely funny movie. Although some of it seems stolen from other movies, it manages to pull off a difficult job: making a believable world that is consistently funny throughout. Undeniably, the best part is Scrat (or is it Scrap). Whenever he's on screen, I can't help to bust out laughing. Too bad he's not part of the main story. The main characters include a mammoth Manny (Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), and Diego the saber tooth tiger (Dennis Leary; apparently, they didn't think alliteration was appropriate for this character). All in all, these characters manage to get some good laughs (although they pale in comparison with Scrat). Sid can sometimes get annoying, but overall the three main characters aren't bad.There are plenty of good scenes, including a fight with a group of apocalyptic dodos, an amusing trip in an ice cave, and a final scene with Diego's pack. Some parts of the movie feel stolen from other movies. The pack feels like something from ""The Lion King"" and the baby seems like it was lifted out of ""Monsters Inc."" Furthermore, although I'm not complaining about the voice talents, I wish they would do what Pixar does, and mine the creative depths of the staff as opposed to just going to large scale celebrities for voices.Still, this was an excellent animated film. I would recommend this over ""Robots"" any day.",Ice Age
249,coolfasho-1,A Truly exceptional animation,9,11 September 2006,"Here we have a a phenomenal animated cinematic production. The financial investment it must have taken to establish such a highly-defined animated film must have been considerably extensive, but as any typical viewer can perceive, including myself, the effort has truly paid off. The voluminous and solemn Manfred (Ray Romano) accompanied by the burdensome yet substantially droll Sid (John Leguizamo) make an interesting duo as they embark upon an adventure to return a child to his widower father. Even Denis Leary's voice acting of Siego applies an interesting vocal sound which fluctuates in between the prosaic dialogue of Manfred and the high pitched monotony of Sid.The augmentation of the plot outline by the periodic intervention of the hilarious small furry creature (dubbed Scrat) is ingenious. His dogged efforts to conceal his acorn from a foreboding ice age apocalypse results in constant precarious changes in the icy environment. Throughout viewing this singular and witty animated accomplishment I couldn't resist bursting into peals of laughter and calling my friend over to watch it a second time. From beginning to end, the explicit plot is gripping, the voice acting is strikingly humorous, and that inner desire one possesses to view an extraordinary film a second, a third, or even fourth time resounds. In my ranks this intriguing picture deserves a 9/10",Ice Age

I thought this must be a cool movie, as much fun as Shrek or Monsters, Inc. I believe now that it was not as good as either, although Shrek is still my favorite. One idea was even almost the same as Shrek although Ice Age lacks the cool voices. The sloth's attempt to be the mammoth's friend is identical to the donkey's attempt to be Shrek's friend. It may be true that the writers/producers of this movie did not know of Shrek's story line but it still felt like a cheap way to make a movie with a similar theme. It is true that this movie may be more child friendly than Shrek but it also misses the edge and most of the humor of the other movie.

The story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end (its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves) but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different ""animals."" You know the outcome, but you can't help being drawn in. The characters themselves are far more than their voices (the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely believable, strangely. The group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable. You will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think. The animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie. You will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts. I came out wanting the obligatory merchandise, especially the sloth toy, only to be disappointed the next day when I couldn't find anything vaguely related.Which, strangely, makes the movie all the more pure.

Sometimes the touches of reality shine through (especially the water was impressive), but nonetheless, it's a fantasy-world based on reality.

265,yshaibushira,Great,8,26 September 2020,"The first ice age is probably the best of the franchise. The first ice age is the best of the bunch from the reasons below:The writing does lack a bit. It is predictable and unoriginal. But, in order for the movie to be good, the story spice things with vomedy, action and a pretty clever way. The comedy comes in two diffrent ways. First, the slapstic, and second is the dialougue. The slapstic is mostly funny becuase of the execution of the animation and the dialougue is very clecer and one of the films strongest aspects. The movie may not offer much with the script, but the execution does make it good. It also not afried to show some dark themes in order to develop the main characters. Like the sadness when we intruduce to Manny's backstory, the intensity of the action, and the comedy of Sid.The animation is not the best of its time... the animation does look dated and not the best of its time. The textures are weak, the lightning sucks, the rendoring is not strong and the movements can be akward, but this film is from 2002, and even if not the best of its time, it does look good. The animators succeed on capturing the ice age feeling, the overall movements are solid, and the designs are creative and unique in a more animated look that makes them appealing. It may not look good for today, but it is well done for its time.The characters are highly enjoyable, and likeable as well. As Manny is the straight man that his goal might be to get rid of Sid, but still has enough of heart to know what is the right thing to do. Sid is more of a comedy relief, that doesn't always hit its mark, but he is mostly really funny. Diego is actualy kind of a villain, but after a while, he does show some heart to help the group. The characters has a lot of depth either, looking into thier backstory and rules in the film. Scrat doesn't have a rule here, but he is pretty funny. The characters are very likeable and well developed.Ice age is one of the best comedy animated film out there. With a very strong script that is both funny, dark, emotional, and has a very likeable characters. The only thing that drags it down is the animation, which is pretty dated. But other than that, I highly recommend you to check the first, and only the furst one out.",Ice Age
266,Melanie82-1,Wish All Animated Films Were This Good,6,2 October 2008,"I'd have to say this is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago. I can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie. A gorgeous color palette (man, this DVD looks incredible on a flat screen TV set) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make this a big winner. The opening 3-4-minute scene with ""Scat,"" is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him. ""Sid"" the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the movie. He usually has something funny to say throughout the movie. Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tiger. This isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice, sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters. This isn't interrupted with a lot of songs, either: one only brief one and there is nothing offensive, language-wise. If more animated movies were this good, I'd own more.",Ice Age
267,grin,Fun for the children,7,21 October 2002,"No day passes without a new released computer animated movie, so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects. After watching Ice Age I felt that's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre.But it's because I am a Big Guy now, and I am pretty sure that this is a very enjoyable movie for children (maybe up to 14). The story is quite simple, and the ""actors"" are funny in a cute way, without any crude or complex humour. Even the ""evil"" is lovely, fluffy big cat with those funny teeth. And the story has a happy end, which was a small disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way) but a great thing for children. And apart from some fights nobody dies (not even when he gets stomped on by a mammoth, several times), which made a cartoony feeling.The computer animation part is nice but nothing special, apart from some really nice cartoony feeling scenes, when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics. [Which means lots of work nevertheless!]There were some gags which made me smile - I accept, the creators tried to satisfy those grownups - but they are hard to spot and (in my opinion) better left unnoticed, since it does not feel to fit into the story.Overall it's a nice movie, but it's rather in the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-children disney cliche.

268,callipygian,A fine kids movie,4,31 March 2002,"Having been blown away by what animated films are capable of inthe last year (Shrek & Monsters, Inc.) as far as cross-generationalhumor, I was sadly disappointed by Ice Age.All the reviews said, if you like Shrek and Monsters, Inc., you'll loveIce Age.  The trailer made it look interesting, the cast was good,and this movie had everything going for it.  Sadly, it didn't live up towhat it could have been.The animation was poor by today's standards, with the humancharacters looking more like GI Joe's than people.  The cave menhad square jaws, rigid lines, and twine hair.  Their movement wasjerky and unnatural.  It was a big step down from other recentanimated films.  The wind blowing through Sullivan's hair on theice covered mountainside in Monsters, Inc. comes to mind forexample.Poor animation could have been overlooked, if it weren't for thepredictable plot and tired jokes.  At one point in the movie, an 8year old boy sitting next to me turned to his friend and said, ""Oh mygod, this is so predictable, next he's gonna <insert spoiler here>"". All I can say is that when an 8 year old finds a movie toopredictable, it's not going to keep me interested for long.As I mentioned earlier, I've enjoyed several other recent animatedfilms that offered something to multiple generations.  Theycontained jokes that were clearly intended for a mature audience. Ice Age had one or two, an amusing commentary on evolutioncomes to mind, but for the most part, the jokes were all kid stuff.To sum it all up, if you've got kids that want to go see Ice Age, by allmeans, take them; I'm sure they'll love it.  If on the other handyou're interested in something you can both enjoy, or maybe youdon't have any kids at all but are a kid at heart, I'm afraid Ice Agemay let you down.",Ice Age
269,valens-1,Fox make a good animated film?,8,22 February 2002,"forget your wizards and rings.  The REAL big genre is still animated cinema.  And 20th century Fox add admirably to the genre, for the first time it looks like they have a box office winner.Starting with a crazed squirrel character,who is in the whole film, and has nothing to do with the main story,(getting human child back to his pack,don't ask),who heavily resembles a benzidrine addled speedy gonzales, ice age settles into being an entertainment xtravaganza.  bad news, Ray Ramano, the obviously cheap star from a t.v.show that doesn't play outside of the US - his manfred the mammoth is as dreary a voice as garry shandling doing a cartoon voice, boring. he sucks a lot of energy out of the film, but John Leguiazamo as syd the sloth provides much needed energy, and great sequences with the dodo's, (it plays like a pixar short) and the ice itself,(even though the ice age is barely touched on in the story, apart from Ray Ramano probably hurting overseas markets, a great piece of animated entertainment",Ice Age

The jokes are lame and puerile, the story predictable, the characters annoying, and the animation is surprisingly poor quality. It's not terrible, but it's not great.

The computer graphics were okay as far as the characters were concerned but the animation was nor particularly good nor particularly fluid. The characters, however, are really cute and parts of the movie are hilarious.  I give it 8 out of 10.",Ice Age
272,Starfiremyst,Ice Age: The only 2002 film that is not Sylvialess,10,15 April 2008,"""Ice Age"" is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the company's first. We are introduced to the main characters: a squirrel named Scrat (voiced by Chris Wedge, AND PLEASE NOTE: the sound of Scrat's screams is the sound of Tom's screams from the ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons), a woolly mammoth named Manny (voiced by Ray Romano of ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), a sloth named Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo of ""Titan A. E.""), and a saber toothed tiger named Diego (voiced by Denis Leary of Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"").The movie opens with Scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that, he caused an avalanche. We then see a herd going south for the coming Ice Age (except for Manny, who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him). Sid comes out of his cave yawning, and saw that his family abandoned him. He then pays toll with some aardvarks. Unfortunately, he gets pursued by Sylvia (voiced by Kirsten Johnston of ""3rd Rock from the Sun""), a female orange sloth, who wants Sid to go migrating with her. Sid eventually teams up with Manny, and they became friends.Meanwhile, nearby a human tribe, Soto (voiced by Goran Visnjic), an evil saber toothed tiger, wants revenge against the tribe's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son, Roshan, away from him. In the morning, he, Diego, and Soto's henchmen, Lenny (voiced by Alan Tudyk), Oscar (voiced by Diedrich Bader), and Zeke (voiced by Jack Black) attacked the tribe, but the leader's wife escaped with Roshan and gave him to Manny and Sid to look after. Eventually, Diego joins them, and went on a journey to return Roshan back to his tribe, who are also looking for him as well. Relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out, okay? Besides Manny, Sid, Diego, Scrat, Sylvia, and Roshan, the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that Roshan's tribe are using, and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named Jennifer (voiced by Jane Krakowski), and a skinny female yellow sloth named Rachel (voiced by Lorri Bagley), to whom Sid shows them Roshan as they relax in a tar pit. Incidentally, the two rhinos, Carl (voiced by Cedric The Entertainer of PDI's ""Madagascar""), and Frank (voiced by Stephen Root of Pixar's ""Finding Nemo""), who go after Sid for ruining their meal and confront Manny on a cliff, are simple minor characters. Same went for the dodos, who are using melons as their food supply.The gags in this movie are very funny. For instance, Manny talks through his trunk saying, ""I'M NOT GOING!"" When Jennifer and Rachel are out of the tar pit, Sid asks Jennifer ""What do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens?"" Jennifer then responds to him, ""What do you say if you go jump into the TAR PIT!?"" Rachel also then kicks Sid in the waist. Sylvia sees Diego holding Sid by the neck with his teeth, then she asks Sid if he's holding his breath, tells Diego to eat him, and promptly walks off.Since ""Ice Age"" is not only a success, but it has 2 sequels: the first one was ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", which was released in 2006, and the other was ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"", which is going to be releasing next year. I can hardly die waiting to see what ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" will be like.",Ice Age
273,jbt136,Fun and entertaining movie.,9,20 April 2002,"This movie was an entertaining kids movie that I think was enjoyed more by the adults in the theater than the kids.

9.0",Ice Age
274,kalel6868,"Uneven, But Still Fun in a Cutesy Way",6,4 December 2002,"Millions of years ago (or thousands, depending on your religious beliefs) a squirrel-rat forced an acorn into a crack in the ice, causing an avalanche that kicked off the Ice Age.At least, that's what this silly diversion of a movie would have you believe.And the comic relief provided by that squirrel-rat character (known as Scrat) as he repeatedly tries to find a hiding place for that acorn is the highlight of an otherwise uneven but sporadically funny, though at times mean-spirited family movie.After the Ice Age hits, herds of prehistoric mammals start migrating towards warmer temperatures.  A sloth named Sid (voiced by a lisping John Leguizamo) gets left behind by his family (not surprising, considering how annoying this odd-looking little creature is) and takes up with a brooding woolly mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano).Meanwhile, a pack of sabre-tooth tigers led by the evil Soto (Goran Visnjic) attacks a tribe of primitive humans.  One human mother manages to get away with her baby, but is chased down by Soto's second-in-command Diego (Dennis Leary).  Soto commands Diego to bring the baby back at all costs.And wouldn't you know, the baby is found by Sid and Manfred, who decide to guard him and get him back to his family.Essentially a road movie without cars, the rest of the plot follows the adventures of Sid, Manfred and Diego in their trek across the tundra played mostly for laughs.  Which is why the occasional lapses into dramatic territory (such as the revelation of what happened to Manfred's family, and the rather violent end that comes to one of the villains) seem to come in from another movie altogether.The animation is good, but noticeably inferior to the similarly plotted MONSTER'S INC; but then I don't think they were going for realism here.  All of the characters look like three-dimensional cartoons.Overall, it's a passable time-killer with a few good laughs, and a storyline that's just predictable enough to keep you comfortable.Sort of like a comfy old coat that's been worn a few too many times.",Ice Age

It deals with lots of touchstones for kids and for adults. Friendship, respect for differences, environment care, even biodiversity are tasks developed in this movie. I encourage all film-makers to make films like this. You don't have to be sad, tedious and formal to make people's consciences change. I'm sure you will be pleased and will laugh out loud, but in some times one tear will appear in your eye and you've been moved by a lot of scenes. On the other hand, I won't recommend the same way Ice Age 2. Yes, it's very funny to see that rare animal pursuing its acorn, but I think it's tiring. It has some good things like love for family and also a full charge of friendship. Second part is not bad. First part is fantastic. I remember a lot of good cartoon series in the 70's and the 80's (say Heidi, Maya...) and some good films from Disney's Factory. It's a pleasure to see that the spirit of such productions is in this 21st Century Movie. One of the best of its genre. I strongly recommend a purchase. Put it to your kids and make them laugh.

Ice Age is loaded with well crafted characters, an excellent accessible script, and great visual slapstick. Inside the theater where I saw the movie, the audience laughed loudly and often. So did I. Everyone left the theater smiling.Unlike many other recent big budget animation pictures, the voice acting matched the characters personalities perfectly and did not take me out of the movie in the least.But in the end, it was the simplicity of the movie that make me believe that it will stand the test of time, which is why I gave it a 10.Excellent!",Ice Age

The expression of the characters through their movement and faces is amazing. Definitely the best out of everything I've seen before. So realistic. It's the subtlety that does it. The story is a relatively straight-forward adventure/return to home type thing. What makes this stand above other films of this type is the interaction between the characters. Using animals means that they can be physically very different from one another alongside their personality differences, and this works very well indeed. There's some great humour in there and some really touching moments as the main characters overcome their differences and bond into their herd.I really can't fault it. I'd recommend it to anybody. I just hope that they make a sequel.",Ice Age

Fox people finally got the hang of it; I liked 'Anastasia' pretty much though. I don't understand why 'Ice Age' is NOT in the IMDb #200 list! This should be in it. What are you thinking, people?!? I've seen a lot of animations so far in my life and this is it. 'Shrek'? No way. 'Toy Story 2'? Close but not enough inspiration as this one has. No offense though- I basically like all well-made animations. Probably the FOX image came under a shadow. What if this was made by Disney?-while it is not possible whatsoever. They became too complacent to produce this kind of gem.Anyhow,""Ice Age"" is THE first animated picture that made me laugh a hearty laugh(TRUE!) and also made me naturally sob at the end. I was not forced at all. All the characters are great-they acted very well together. My sis dotes on the baby and the tiger. Denis Leary did a fine job,by the way. John Leguizamo especially. I didn't even know the voice was him!I got so excited and I don't know if I'm writing this down correctly but PLEASE! Folks who like clean & slick animation and give you laughs&tears, GO SEE THIS!

282,dr_rjp,I loved this film!,10,19 March 2002,"What I think is a testament to this animated film is the fact that I forgot it was an animated film while watching it.The artwork is beautiful and captivating, but the antics and cameraderie of the cast are what take it to a higher level.  The storyline is not unique, but how many films are these days?  What is unique is how well the writer, producer, director and cast all work together.Despite the superficial resemblance to ""Three Men and a Baby,"" this is a buddy film in all respects. The characters continually play off each other in subtle ways lacking in such other films as ""Monsters, Inc."" and even ""Shrek.""Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary work so well together that it's hard to believe this was their first, joint project.  The only flaw I found in this trio was Romano's voiceover of Manny (which was no different from his ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" character).  As plain, bland, and easily recognizable as Ray's voice was, it was more than compensated by Leguizamo's quirky-sounding Sid and Leary's cool-cat rendition of Diego.From the moment the movie begins, the gags flow fast and furious, thanks to the addition of the adorable Scrat (voiceover by Director, Chris Wedge). Scrat is the Pleistocene's answer to Wile E. Coyote, but much funnier. There are other throwbacks to previous animated fare (such as Tarzan and Lion King), but, for the most part, Ice Age avoids the strictly formulaic approach to toon films that Hollywood seems to lazily adopt.  Sure, there are those intentionally sentimental moments you have come to expect in every Disney film ever made. Yet, they are not so weighty as to put a drag on the comic continuity of the film.There are also moments in the film where you can see homage being paid to the great animator and gagster, Fred Avery, as when all the characters make their imprint on a snow bank as they crash into it at high speed.This is a film that has something for all age groups. It has silly toon humor for the kidlets, and sly innuendoes for the adults.  I cannot wait to see it again.",Ice Age

TONS of cliches abound. But don't let that get in the way of your enjoyment.  Watch it without being a grumpy cynic and you will come away satisfied for the $8 ticket you just paid.  It's a film that will make you smile along the way and maybe sniffle at the end.  This wasn't meant to be an astract masterpiece.  It was meant as a fun for all ages film and it definitely succeeds. Basic storyline of 3 mammalian misfits coming together to save a baby boy. The voice casting was perfect.  John L. is especially fitting as the clumsy sloth.  The others barely have lines.  The small rodent/squirrel is also good for some short comic relief along the way as he tries hard to bury its acorn.  It was nice to see how they kept Manny's reason for being a loner mysterious until the (almost) very end. What made this movie enjoyable for me were the fantastic job the animators did with the whole body expressions.  This is like watching a CG muppets/Sesame street.  The fur and fat undulates, muscles stretch and contract conveying a very comical feel. Manny's fur and Sid's belly were especially well done. Unfortunately, they focused so much on the animals the humans were left as an afterthought; too robotic but you don't see much of them anyway.  I also love how there were very little saccharine songs (ahem, Disney) to revolt you.  It's wonderful to see how well CG (and people talent) is coming along.  This presents a much more level playing field for the movie studios.  Disney definitely doesn't own this joint which is a great thing since their stuff has been uninspired of late. I can easily (and heartily) recommend this film seeing as how the competition the last 4 weeks have been utter garbage.  So go on, watch it and bring the kids!",Ice Age

Ray Romano and the other actors who do the voices are great. I have seen this movie twice already and will definitely get the DVD when it comes out tomorrow. Absolutely a delightful film, and the computer animation is excellent.

The main plot outline is that 2 weird companions, Sid (a sloth) and Manny(a mammoth) find this baby belonging to a group of humans, in which they try to return the baby. They then meet up with Diego, a cool sabre toothed tiger who wants the baby for himself. But as the film goes on, he becomes good and wants to return the baby himself.

John L's sloth was utterly unloveable, and I cringed through most of his lines.  The mammoth had one, and ONLY one, shining moment - when he saw the paintings in the cavern.  The sabretooth was at least a good character, but had such a small role, really.  And Pinky/Lumpy wasn't HALF as cute as Boo.  Plus, the animation was really second-rate (compared to MI), the plot was methodical and predictable, and most of the humour fell flat. 
On the up side, this movie had much more death (implied, not shown) than most Pixar creations, so I'd say it's much more mature and therefore earns an extra point.If this film had one truly redeemable quality, it'd be that darned squirrel. Add about another four segments with HIM, and this movie would have been a hoot.  As it is, I rate Ice Age slightly better than average, 6/10.",Ice Age

An interesting take on the John Wayne film ""3 Godfathers"", which revolved around three outlaws who find a dying woman that gives birth to a baby and requests the men take the baby back to town to give the baby a chance at life.

302,wolf_beautell,Loved it!,9,19 July 2002,"Why are digital animation films taking successfully over traditional animation? Because of examples like ""Toy Story"" (1&2), ""A Bug's Life"", ""Shrek"" (wonderful), ""Monsters, Inc."" and now, ""Ice Age"".As the rest of listed films, the secret of this new breed of animation is found in the ORIGINALITY of the idea...ORIGINALITY-something quite difficult to find in cinema nowadays. The story told by ""Ice Age"", although simple, is perfectly narrated and very well ""juiced"" by their producers, as throughout the story you find lots of gags and scenes that could seem not essential for the story, but are excellent (the final scene, for instance) and very funny.The originality of this ""Ice Age"" stands in the excellent design of both characters and scenery, and in the excellent personification of the animals we see during the movie. A special mention for the squirrel, Scrat, one of the funniest toons I've ever seen. Another interesting point is the ambition of Fox Animation to transmitt, alike Disney films, a message (in this film, sort of friendship, courage and ecologic balance between humans and nature), but not in the classic ""kiddish"" way we are so tired of watching. The thing is, here that message doesn't take over the whole plot of the story: the real ingredient is the humour the film constantly radiates, let the public enjoy a memorable film just by its ambition of being extremely funny and humorous, not by showing a kind of serious melodrama, like happened with ""The Prince Of Egypt"" and many of the last Disney´s, such as ""Pocahontas"". David Newman's music outstands: rhythmic and very playful, like the very first piece of the film, in the starting credits and the migration of animals to the south.What more can I say? Many more small things and details, but the essential is summarized here. Just say this is NO film for kids and youngsters: the fame of animation of being exclusively aimed at children is finished. So important has this genre become, that even the Academy has made an exclusive Oscar for the best animation film of the year. Because thingts have changed. Just by watching the films I listed at the beginning, you'll find the answer. And ""Ice Age"" follows this new tradition of excellent and original digital animation.VOTE ----> 9/10",Ice Age

It is incredibly funny and the computer animation is great and more realistic than in other CGI films like Shrek. Compared to Monsters Inc. which I saw a week ago this was definitely funnier and did not have this sweet and tame Disney style. The story itself may not be the innovation of the year but the characters are so lovely - especially the unlucky squirrel which is so funny that it deserves a leading role.To sum up, Fox hit it big with that movie and (in my opinion) even tops all the other great animated features like Toy Story, Antz or Shrek. Ice Age is entertainment at its best!",Ice Age

The animation quality was also very good for a 2002 movie. The Character Scrat is also very funny and enjoyable.

Everything you see in the trailer is about the funniest parts of the film. All right the story is quite original but they could have made more of it. It wasn't filled up. No background music or long talks. So it's a silent movie.The jokes and sketches that are made are funny but nothing more and nothing less.The main figure seen in the trailers is in fact the background figure in the film. And he makes the most fun parts. So I would say ""give scrat his own movie"".greetzzzzzzzzzz Joep",Ice Age
307,Pegg,Any new idea in the funny fairy-tale!,6,5 November 2002,"This film is really for children. It is funny, but it hasn't any new idea. There is no reality. It is a fairy-tale and it does not say almost anything real about primeval ages. The classical double - clever and silly, big and small etc. isn't a new idea too. The animation could be better. The best idea of this film is the small tale of the squirrel. Children will have a nice experience but this film won't give them any new knowledge for life.",Ice Age
308,Cyril2122,Good for kids,7,8 June 2003,"I wouldn't go so far as to not recommend this movie, since the only problems I have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems. That doesn't make it bad, just not something I'd go far.It is a little saccharine, so I might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for-kids movie like this.However, all of that goes out the window when that squirrel (the one in all the trailers) comes on-screen. His time is limited, but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys 'hey, could you stick in a little more squirrel?' every time it's getting intolerably dull. That doesn't save the movie, but you can leave saying 'at least there was one aspect where I couldn't stop laughing.'And of course, visually it won't disappoint, but that's almost a given with Pixar flicks. Of all of their stuff, I'd put this at the bottom...but that isn't in itself bad.",Ice Age
309,eric_hanson,"Great Animation, Great Cast, what happened to the story?",7,23 January 2003,"SPOILERS!A+ for animation, the humans looked human, loved the look and feel.
However, if you want a story about a mis-understood giant and an annoying small sidekick, you would be better off watching _Shrek (2001)_. Everytime I would see a scene that was suppposed to be funny, I would think ""This is just like Shrek, only, different somehow, oh yes, not as funny"".  The one true original scene was the ice cave sequence.  Everything else was a stereotypical mishmash of animation cliches.  Oh look, the psuedo-villian has a last-second change of heart (Emperor's New Groove).  Oh look, a lake of lava, never seen that before (Shrek).  Oh look, creatures stuck with a baby and hilarious antics ensue (Monsters Inc).Seems like the animators had some cool technology to show off and simply cut and paste a plot together.  I mean, don't get me wrong, there are broad elements common to almost all movies/stories, however, it seemed that Ice Age went out of its way to simply reuse other bits of movies, without giving it a personal touch/ new spin.  What a shame.  Great cast though.",Ice Age

They're hunted by a pack of other sabertooth tigers who are portrayed as the bad guys.I've heard of white washing and witnessed it all too many times. Where humans identifying with their skin- instead of accessible heritage that other skin tones do not have- edit historical facts to make dead people sound less horrible than they were so that said white people can pretend that said dead people weren't as bad as we all know they were.Now, just apply that to humans in general.

313,star_gazer_1628,One of the best animated films EVER!,9,11 May 2007,"I first saw this film in a cinema when it was first released, and it is now one of my personal favourites. Even now, 5 years later, it still manages to make me laugh. I can't really choose just one aspect of the film that makes it so brilliant, but I definitely think that the cast has something to do with it. Ray Romano is a great choice for Manny; he can be moody and sullen at times, but we also get an insight into why he is like that; he is hiding his pain. Dennis Leary is brilliant as Diego; you're never quite sure where you stand with his character until the very end. Sid the sloth has got to be the funniest character in the film (aside from Scrat possibly); without him, the other characters would have no one to direct their sarcastic comments at, and there would be a lot less comic relief. John Leguizamo is amazing; the voice he gives Sid is so distinct and funny that it makes me laugh every time. He gives a charm to the character; even though he may well be one of the ugliest things you've ever seen, you warm to his kindness and loyalty to his friends. Sometimes when watching a film, there are parts that really seem to drag; fortunately, I did not find any such moments in this film. Possibly the best scene ever has got to be the one with the dodos. Granted, the way they died was dissimilar to the truth (we were the ones who hunted them to extinction) but the slow-mo scene with Sid and the melon was absolutely hilarious: Dodos flying everywhere and Sid leaping over their heads. I was in stitches. Backgrounds are a little plain and not realistic, but hey, this is a cartoon, not a super-realistic blockbuster. As I have mentioned before, the voices are perfect for their characters, and they give a little bit of themselves to the role. The interaction between the leads is brilliant and the dialogue is hilarious. Anyone who loves a decent comedy movie, go see ""Ice Age"", (but I must admit, I personally was disappointed by the sequel; that's just my opinion.)",Ice Age
314,cougarpop,"Not as good as Monsters, Inc. - But you'll love the squirrel",5,15 March 2002,"At times this movie was pretty good, but generally not as good as Shrek or Monsters, Inc.  I don't think it will hold the adults attention as well as the other two.  The characters were not as lovable, and Ray Romano's vice characterization was not nearly on par with John Goodman or Mike Meyers. Similarly, John Leguizamo's side kick character was not as good as Eddie Murphy or Billy Crystal.  Generally, a second rate knockoff.  The prehistoric squirrel was worth the price of a matinee ticket!",Ice Age
315,brotherfallout,Falls Behind the Pack,6,17 March 2002,"Ice Age is an example of the more slapstick, less satirical animated movie. Not too long ago this would have been regarded as a decent enough cartoon. But now, with movies like Toy Story and Shrek appearing, the slapstick humor of Ice Age seems less clever and makes it less appealing. The movie has its moments, but it really doesn't compare to the more modern satirical animated film. The vocal talents are impressive, especially Ray Romano and Denis Leary, but I see this as a second-rate movie.",Ice Age

317,va12voltgrl,Skip this movie,2,30 November 2002,"I read through the comments, immediately after FORCING myself to watch this film...this was without a doubt, the most boring cartoon I have ever sat through. I did not care at ALL about the characters...they had no personalities, no character traits to make you excited when they begin a line, or begin a joke. I agree the squirrel creature with it's acorn was a little amusing..but I'd already seen it 40 times in the movie trailer.I think Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Leguizamo did the best they could with the script...but I bet they were picturing better graphics. I thought the creatures were all LESS than lifelike..especially the humans. They looked exactly like characters in PC video games..which are mass produced, and I'm sure with LESS budget than Fox decided to spend on this movie.Kids might enjoy it..but not many kids I know. If you  need to amuse children....try Monster's Inc...or any disney flick. If you are an adult looking for a great, moving film...try Shrek or Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron.

Never a boring moment.",9,14 December 2002,"Lately I have been a bit let down by the story content of the animated offering which don't seem to be keeping up with the soaring technology that showcases these stories. ""Ice-Age"" is an exception as it is concise and interesting and is over so fast I found myself wishing it would just go on. While the technology is impressive as seen in the remarkable fire, moving water and smoke filled scenes, the technology is used sparingly which is good as it lets the story shine and it does. In addition to a neat and clever story the voices of the characters fit and the plot really books avoiding getting bogged in songs that don't further the plot [like some of Don Bluth's epics].I have not yet seen the special DVD features, but I did watch the film twice on our first showing on DVD. This film compares very well to the Lion King but has less music and a faster cleaner plot. 4.5 Stars!",Ice Age
320,michael-colan,Although it may not be Original we are Won Over by the Great Characters and Humor,8,10 November 2012,"Around the early 21st century computer animated family films had really taken off. Through the recent hits of Shrek and Monster's Inc, people started seeing money in this business. So in Blue Sky's first ever animated film they may have not been very original but the film known as Ice Age has enough charm and laughs to be very acceptable.The film takes place in the Ice Age when a sabertooth cat, a sloth and a mammoth take in the care of a lost baby and attempt to return it to the humans who have lost it.Now the story is really a cross between Shrek and Monsters' Inc. In Shrek we have the lonely character (in this film is Manny) getting crossed in the path of a lovable idiot (Sid the Sloth) that is faced with a quest and in this film it's returning the baby. Returning the baby part is just like Monster's Inc. where the characters have to return a little girl back to her room. So really story wise the film isn't that original and it's not like a good homage, it feels a little too noticeable in places. Usually when a film does this it takes me right out of the movie but because of the characters and the funny stuff they get themselves into I can't help but ignore this ""big"" problem.The characters are the best part of the film. Manny the Mammoth is the lonely character that would rather be left alone then be bothered by anyone else. He doesn't like people (or the other animals) and he really doesn't want to deal with stupid things. Yet for an animated film he has a rather deep character with a dark past that is explored in more detail later in the film. But also he is really funny making the sarcastic remarks and other smaller jokes that is really funny. Ray Romano really shines in this part and makes a mark as a different character and doesn't play Raymond Barone from Everybody Loves Raymond.The next character is the stupid and lovable and funny Sid the Sloth. He isn't that deep of a character but he really doesn't need to be. All we need to know is that he cares a great deal about the rest of the characters and just wants to be accepted. Other than that he really is ""the funny guy"" and he is really funny. John Leguizamo creates a very memorable character filled with great jokes and gags and memorable lines.The final character out of the main ones is Diego the sabertooth cat (tiger)and he is another fantastic character. He is at first set up as the villain and throughout the film you can never tell whose side he is on but you can tell that he starts to care for the other characters. Denis Leary voices him and is a great talent and a great voice. He can be serious and funny at the same time and just like the rest gives us a great show.As a bonus we get a side character named Scrat. He is the Wild Coyote of our times. He presents us with no dialogue but a good dose of some fantastically funny slapstick humor that will always make you laugh. The character has nothing to do with the story and he is just there to give a few extra laughs and the character works.The humor is the film is very well done. It may not be ground breaking by any means and some jokes are recycled from other films but really the rest of it works completely. We get slapstick humor, smart humor and some plan old good old fashion jokes. All work well and should be enjoyable for every age group.There are also some good animated action sequences, some of them really fun (like the ice cave sequence) and some of them very tense and exciting. All of them of course have jokes in there even the more serious sequences with the exception of the fight at the end. These sequences are great for people of all ages and will be enjoyed by people of all ages.Another thing the film has is a lot of heart. Throughout the film you get this theme of family and love and even loyalty along with friendship. Parts where Manny's Character is explored more is very touching and might even come as a surprise. Also near the end where we finally see Diego as he true self is also very touching and well done. Also where the characters first save the baby after the rest of the humans lose it is also very well done. In fact this film was originally supposed to a Drama instead of a family animated film but Fox would not accept it as a Drama and wanted it to be a family film. But I think a lot of the Drama Elements still carried over to the final film without being in your face about it. The film has a lot of themes and really a lot of heart which is something that is missing is a lot of recent non-computer animated films.The animation on the film is really good too. It might not be as good as Pixar or DreamWorks buts it wasn't trying to be. The film has animation that looks very good and state of the art but it maintains a more classic animated film. So the animation is good but it's nothing grand and I think it works for a film like this.The Bottom Line is this is a very funny animated film that has some great animated characters and is very well drawn out and funny and even though the film sometimes feels like a copy of other films the film has enough charm and touching moments to make us forget about it.Final Score 8/10",Ice Age
321,Gandoon,"Funny, but does not reach greatness",4,24 April 2003,"This was a nice film, it was funny and so on but it had a major flaw: It embraces many classic Hollywood clichés. At points it is almost too much with all the classic plot evolution that can be found in a not insignificant number of other titles, mostly found in the adventure and action genres.The dialog was witty in a very characteristic Hollywood manner and if you don't like that this film might get a little annoying but not impossible to watch.The animation is surprisingly cubistic for a film made in 2002 and that could be allright if it were a stylistic move but that is not obvious from the film. If you compare it to such resent computer animated films as ""Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within"" and ""Shrek"", both are by the way made before Ice Age, you will probably be disappointed if you wanted a brilliantly animated film.With this I want to say that this is a nice film, worth the time to watch but does not give much more than an average Hollywood production.",Ice Age
322,patgreene,"Good, not great",7,17 March 2002,"I saw this film with five, eight, eleven and forty year old children. Between us, we've seen almost every animated film made in the last twelve years, in most cases multiple times. (We deliberately missed ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and ""El Dorado"" after reading early reviews.)  The general consensus was that, while not up to the best of the computer-animated genre, it was entertaining and amusing.  (I especially liked John Leguizamo's voice for Sid the Sloth.)  We rated it as better than ""Monster's Inc."" but not as good as ""Shrek"" or either of the ""Toy Story"" films.  Roughly equivalent to ""Jimmy Neutron"".  Or as, my husband pointed out, he wouldn't pay to see it in a theater a second time,  but he wouldn't be driven crazy by the kids playing it over and over once we got the DVD, either.And the more players in the animation field, either traditional or computer-generated, the better, for those people like me who feel that animated films are generally underappreciated as an art form.  (Personally, I think the fact that Disney no longer has a lock on quality animated features is all to the good.) I will keep an eye out for new features from this group.",Ice Age
323,paxman356,Good for kids AND adults alike,8,23 March 2002,"The movie was good.  This visuals were outstanding.  Only people are still hard to draw with computers, and it shows.  The story, albeit simple, was entertaining.  But jumping from Yellowstone (Old Faithful) to England (Stonehenge) to France (Lascaux) seems a stretch, even if the world was one big continent at the time.  Not good for a children's movie...no wonder we don't know geography in America.Character voices were good.  Ray Romano didn't have to stretch too much, and was effective as the Manfred the Mammoth.  Supporting cast was good as well. Goran Visnijic (Dr. Kovac, ER) as Soto, the alpha-male sabre-tooth?  I didn't even recognize the voice until the credits.  But in my humble opinion, John Leguizamo WAS Sid.  He did an excellent job voicing the character, and making Sid his own.  John has talent, I just wish he did more (maybe it is the To Wong Foo... curse.)One last thing.  Sid bears an awfully big resemblance to the donkey in Shrek.  Sid is saved by a big scary Mammoth; the donkey, by ugly looking Shrek.  Sid makes the Mammoth his friend; the donkey, Shrek...well, I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  I hope next time Pixar comes up with something completely new.I thought the little sabre toothed mouse (or whatever it was) would be the Jar-Jar of the movie, and ruin it.  But it was great comic relief, and nicely played.This movie could have been a nine if the lame jokes that distorted geography were left out, a ten if they could have left the Shrek angle out.

At first I was afraid that the funny sequences from the two trailers would be the best clips from the movie cut into a nice teaser, but it didn't take long to get rid of that fear, as the fun just kept going & going for the whole film through!The characters are extremely funny and really nicely animated, it's hard to believe this was not a Dreamworks or a Disney picture but for me at least a total newcomer in the animated movies genre not having seen Titan AE yet (even though this movie has certainly made me put it up in queue).I do not get the criticism this movie has got from some of the early user comments. ""Ray Romano boring and depressed as the mammoth"" - A. Well, the mammoth was a depressed and sad character in the movie, so that shouldn't be such a surprise?! B. He did a very good job with the voice IMHO and was also really funny at times. C. This movie would hardly need any more energy than it already has, thank you very much!Also, just because a few of the scenes reminds me of other movies (Shrek comes to mind at about 2 short scenes) doesn't make it any worse! All movies takes ideas and inspiration from other movies in the same genre and this one can definitely stand on its own!Monsters has nothing compared to this movie, which is right now doing a major struggle in my mind for first place with Shrek.

Each have to deal with huge emotional stresses during the film and and can relate to each of them. When it appears, that Diego (a sabor-toothed tiger) is died, and silently cried with sadness, and happiness, when the human child is reunited, then sadness again, when the child goes, then happiness again, when it appears that Diego is in fact alive.

341,scotty_pimpin87,Defines animation at it's best,7,15 March 2002,"Finally - A family movie worth seeing!  I have been itching for 'Ice Age' to come out since the unforgettable teaser was released in Spring of 2001.Overall, the movie was great...while the performances (given by Romano, Leguizamo, Leary) were just so-so.  They had great parts to work with, and they just didn't give it enough 'oomph' to top it all off.  But of course, my favorite character 'Scrat' was wonderful.  Every scene was just hilarious with him in it.Animation wise, it was breath-taking.  Definitely a different feel than Monster's Inc, and Shrek.  Not saying that it was bad - not at all! Just, well, DIFFERENT in a 'cool' sort of way.At some points, it seemed like it took off from Disney's 2000 dud ""Dinosaur"".  For example: the teaser trailer.  But, it worked great anyways.Only TWO bad thing:  TOO SHORT!  I say it ran for about 1 hour and 20 minutes only, and they could've extended the story longer.  Oh, and Scrat needed more appearances!  He made Ice Age what it is today - an animated beauty.",Ice Age
342,mikman27,The Squirrel was hilarious!!!,8,18 March 2002,"Good story line that will keep you involved throughout the movie. Great job with voices by John Leguizamo, Dennis Leary, and Ray Romano as the humdrum Wooly Mammoth. Kids and adults alike will love the squirrel scenes that are intertwined within the main characters travels throughout the movie. In comparison with other animation flicks, I would certainly have to put it above Shrek, and just a hair below the original Toy Story. Not the worst way that you could spend a couple of hours with the kids!!",Ice Age
343,deerhunter98,A MUST SEE,9,23 March 2002,"I don't have any technical expertise, but all I have to say is that Ice Age is a definite must see.  It is hilarious at times, sad at times, and overall just a well done movie.  I would put it on the same scale as Monsters Inc. The kids will love.  I definitely recommend this movie.",Ice Age
344,jbilbrey1,Very Funny,7,6 May 2002,"This is one of the years funniest cartoons.  If you need a laugh, go out and see it.  This movie will have you laughing almost all the way through it.

345,kikka_ip,Ice Age beats Shrek !,9,16 May 2002,"For the lovers of Shrek there is now a new challenge on the market. I just saw Ice Age 3 times already and I must say : they've done it. A great animated film situated in the Ice Age, when poor Scrat tries to save his food for worse time. All the animals are going south except a small group that tends to go the other way for various reasons. A mammoth, a sloth, a tiger and a foundling discover what a herd really means and who their real friends are. A very funny, extraordinary collection of in depth characters that give us a splendid time in the cinemas or at home. From hilarious laughs to emotional tears, this is a movie that everyone should see.",Ice Age
346,macblasterg4,shrek in a ice age setting.,1,3 July 2002,The movie can only be summed up as a poor attempt to try to reap the success of Shrek and turn the same story around and manipulate it so that the characters are different but their quests and perils are just the same. Not worth the price of admission. In fact i enjoy the nice popcorn that was coated in a chemical yellow sludge better than this movie.,Ice Age
347,glatouf,Scratch!,8,21 October 2002,"The movie itself was ok for the kids. But I gotta tell ya that Scratch, the little squirrel, was the funniest character I've ever seen. He makes the movie all by himself. He's the reason I've just love this movie. Congradulations to the crew, it made me laugh out loud and always will!",Ice Age
348,rimohit,IIIIICCCCEEEE,10,27 December 2002,I'm sick and tired of all the bad reviews about this movie. This is the best animated movie of the year and everyone should treat it with respect. -you can't comment on bad animation on humans becose that was made on purpuse -the graphics are great and no one can deny it -people are complaining about it being childish... it's made for kids so you can't blame anyone for that This is a simple (at least it seams so) movie that everybody will enjoy (except for the people that lost their inner child and are now bi**ing other people about more things than animated pictures),Ice Age
349,Dseuss83,A movie that no one can beat.,10,6 March 2003,"Everything in this movie look like it was real. It was really funny and heartwarming, I laughed and cried. The actors who did the voices were great. The music was moving, just as the movie was going. If there is anyone who said it was dumb, well, they'll be getting a big black eye in history from me. There is no doubt in my mind about this movie. THIS MOVIE IS MADE TO WIN THE ACADEMY AWARD!!!!!!!  This is a movie that no one can beat!!!!",Ice Age
350,reindeer2uk,"""Ice Age"",a marvellous film for everyone",10,7 December 2005,"Although aimed at children, ""Ice Age"" is a little like one of those timeless tribal stories where different age groups get something valuable out of the tale at different levels, whilst always enjoying the story into the bargain.Its simple plot and easy going pace, do nothing but enhance its delivery and charm. Timeless you might say.The film follows three widely different species of mammal as they seek to return a Human child to his people.They are Manfred the mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger. They go through several testing adventures together, an experience which is often fertile soil for the making of strong friendships. Here is no exception since they come to refer to themselves as ""the herd"".I think the choice of mammoth as one of the child's saviours is a wise one since there have been allegorical tales of their surviving relatives, the elephants extending a level of concern beyond their own species.There is one very touching scene which takes place within a cave which Humans have perhaps used for generations to reflect and meditate on their place in the world. It is daubed with paintings of various animals, among which are mammoths being hunted. We are witness though to what appears to be a bond and an understanding between the child and Manfred, that their friendship transcends such concerns.Sid looks like a caricature rather than a real sloth, and most of Diego's feline pride also look caricatured. That said, I simply love the animation of the characters, and the level of observation which has obviously gone into living cats, pachyderms and Humans. Diego does the cat-crawl, and Manfred uses his trunk with absolute sensitivity, as would his latter day relatives.If you have young children show them this film, they'll love it. If you don't have children don't worry. See it anyway, and remember that friendship and responsibility frequently extends to those of another species.",Ice Age
351,kortasthekiller,It's full of adventure.,9,19 April 2006,"It's usually funny throughout the film. My favorite part is when Sid looks down into a mini volcano and his caboose catches on fire! I wanted to put my comments on here about the film because if you or your child likes adventure, then they'll love this movie. There's no violence or language besides when the people tried to attack Manny with sharp sticks, but they don't get him. The computerized art is very realistic and well done. The characters are very cute- even Sid in his own way is cute. The funniest part is when Scrat the squirrel tries to get his nut but the nut and him fall with about a million other nuts. It is funny. I hope Ice Age 2 is as good as Ice Age 1!!!!!!!!!",Ice Age
352,taylort-62416,I still love this movie!,10,28 October 2015,"I first saw this movie when I was five years old. I'm now sixteen and I still love it every bit as much! I love the comedy the best.This story is about animals who are migrating South for the winter in the prehistoric times. Two of the animals, Sid, who is a sloth and Diego, a saber-toothed tiger, befriend a woolly mammoth named Manny. Sid and Diego try to help Manny as he migrates north, while caring for a human baby. For years, Manny has kept his past a secret from everyone, but Diego and Sid help Manny work through his painful feelings along the way. They experience many other challenges on their journey to return the baby to his ""herd"".Ray Romano did an excellent job at playing Manny and I especially loved Sid, voiced by John Leguizamo. Diego was played by Denis Leary. You will love this heartwarming, comedic, family feature film, which carries a hidden message saying, ""No one can make it through life on their own"". I'm ready to see it again!",Ice Age
353,biteme_here,so good i can think a word to describe it!!!!,10,24 March 2006,"oh my goodness this movie is great i love it!! its funny, sad, entertaining and is suitable for all ages!!! i have watch it so many times that the video is nearly wore out! i am going to have to buy it on DVD just so that i can watch it again!! the characters are really good and the actors they chose for the voices are brilliant they really bring the characters to life!! and the quality of the animation is unbelievable the detail of every little things is perfect!! the way the fur moves to the expressions in the eyes is perfect you can really see the emotions they are feeling or thinking. would recommend to any one who wants a fun film for all ages with comedy and a good story!! 11 out of 10!!! :) can't wait til ice age 2 is released so i can watch it again and again. this time i hope the squirrel gets his nut its so cruel watching him be disappointed every time!!",Ice Age
354,shari_boo01,Best Quote I can remember and laugh about,10,22 March 2006,"This is such a hilarious movie in one part of the movie I think when they find the human baby and Sid says something about keeping it and taking care of it and Diego says ""Sure, and maybe he'll grow a tail and call you mama."" I'm sorry...but I laughed so hard and thats one of the hilarious parts I can remember. It was a very fun movie, I mean we all know animals didn't create fire as the show in the movie but...that scene was funny too.I loved all the sarcastic humor, the goofy humor was fun too. One thing I didn't understand was the little squirrel...what the heck was he doing??I can't wait for Ice Age: The MELTDOWN!!",Ice Age
355,MaceAce,"Entertaining, funny and imaginative!",9,26 March 2002,"The graphics' surface textures aren't as sophisticated as those seen in ""Shrek"", but the storyline and caricatures are even funnier.  You'll laugh more often, as the character dialog has great lines and zingers.If nothing else, it's worth seeing ""Ice Age"" for its opening and closing sequences: absolutely hilarious and imaginatively clever!One suggestion:  when viewing the opening sequence of Ice Age, you'd be better off not drinking or chewing.  Your cheeks and diaphragm are going to ache from laughter.",Ice Age
356,bruce1234,no Toy Story or Shrek - but kids loved it!,7,15 March 2002,Well we just came back from this movie and it met our expectations - the kids loved it but not a classic like Toy Story or Shrek.   Most of the funny moments are purely visual gags - and very well done ones - had the kids laughing out loud many times and us chuckling.  This is especially true with a running gag where this squirrel is trying to bury an acorn - Hilarious! But the story is not as interesting to follow as many other kid's movies - very very simple plot - but the young ones will enjoy and even your 5 yr old will be able to follow along.,Ice Age
357,wheezerdog,A Story as far as I'm concerned is as real as we can make it.,10,9 April 2006,When I saw the story unfold I felt like this was just another cartoon that someone made a few bucks on. I was pleasantly surprised to see characters developed with care and a illustrator with a heart. The Woolly's eyes and brow are almost human. He puts his trust in Deigo and Sid and when he almost died when the ice bridge collapsed trying to save Diego I lost it. When Diego asked Manny why he did it he simply said because that's what friends do. I think the story line really shows what we as humans should be like. It is a shame we have to use cartoons to show ourselves what we should be like. I will get caught up on the other Ice Age movies that are now out.,Ice Age

360,evondella,Excellent,9,11 December 2006,"I was thoroughly pleased after watching Ice Age. Every moment of the movie was enjoyable me, and is for people of all ages, from infants to geriatrics. This visually animated film is about a hilarious journey of a few unlikely friends. As animals of all species start their journey to run from the oncoming Ice Age, a few of them get separated from their families and join together to overcome this feat and survive. A mammoth, sloth, and saber-toothed tiger join together to migrate south. Along the way they even rescue a human baby while overcoming their differences with each other.

Cold ice, cool film.",Ice Age
362,runneraeg9,Fun for the kids!,8,25 November 2006,"This movie was very comical and entertaining for me. The characters were my favorite; them all having different personalities. The movie's plot was good and it kept the movie viewer on the edge of their seats because you didn't know what was coming next. I really enjoyed the part where the dodo birds were fighting over the melon. That was funny! My brothers went on and on about that part forever. The main characters in the movie were well developed and acted out. My favorite character was Sid because he made the group laugh and always get into trouble. Overall, the movie didn't have any stand out boring parts because every scene was full of action. I would want to see it again.",Ice Age
363,C-Roberts27,Sid and Manny are on a journey to return a baby to a colony of humans.,9,7 December 2006,"I enjoyed this movie greatly. I loved the animation, it was visually pleasing. The 3D movie which started off using clay, turned into a real set with the help of computer graphics. The humor was suited for both adults and children, so the whole family would enjoy it. I liked the overall message of the movie, which was: never leave your friends behind. I also liked how Diego started off as a bad guy and ended up switching sides and becoming one of Sid and Manny's friends. All the characters have their own personality and are very likable animals. I liked how Sid and Manny saves the baby, and how the baby ends up back with the humans.",Ice Age
364,weaver1515,"A Wooly Mammoth (Manny), a Sloth (Sid), and a Saber Tooth Tiger (Diego) set out to return a Native American child to its home",8,7 December 2006,"It was hard not to compare this movie to others like Monsters Inc. or Shrek, which were also great animated films. I really like the computer animated movies like these. This film is just fun enough and enjoyable enough to rank itself up with the other two. While this film may not be as original, actually seeming to blend the plots of Monsters and Shrek, it doesn't matter due to the lovable character personalities and intriguing scenery. It didn't seem to matter too much that the relationship between Manny and Sid was much like Shrek and the donkey, or that two odd characters are stuck with a human baby, with the larger hairy one eventually warming up to it. Mixing the two plots, tossing the setting back into prehistoric times and using that as a basis for a lot of its humor, works very well here. And the film has heart. While it does seem a little corny at times, the heart is there, and it's always great to see a warm movie like this.",Ice Age
365,Ovdoblondie1234,Ice Age - great movie,10,6 December 2006,"This movie is awesome! Ice Age is definitely a family movie. I would recommend this movie to all ages; for the most part it is directed towards children but i believe that adults would enjoy the movie too. The movie is very funny and will keep you laughing through the whole movie. Not only is it funny, but it has a nice plot and solid characters. Each character has unique traits that compliment each other. The script is well developed and is easy to follow. I would say that this movie is the best animated film of 2002. This film also teaches life lessons to kids such as building friendships, respect for differences, environment care, and even biodiversity. I encourage all film makers to make a film that keeps the audience laughing yet still produces a moral to the story.",Ice Age
366,ROXYchick7267,Ice Age was great!,9,7 December 2006,"I watched the movie Ice Age and i thought it was great. The choice of the character's personalities really showed the types of people you may encounter from your day to day routine. The voices used for the characters really matched how i would picture they would sound. The different angels shown in this movie was great. I think the movie somewhat showed how we have to deal with all different kinds of people in our lives, but that each person, no matter how it may seem, may benefit you in some way; whether it be to teach you a lesson or to led you a helping hand. Overall I think the movie really showed what it might have been like in that time period yet still added humor and wit. I would recommend this movie to any one at any age, child or adult!",Ice Age

I thought that it included real life environmental facts as well as an insight to what that time period was like, as well as a fun and lighthearted plot. I felt as though the animal's mission would be a great lesson for kids..even adult kids too! The animal's bonds, determination, and caring all are perfect teaching tools for young kids as well. The images in the movie were interesting, well thought out, and perfectly crafted for the audience at hand. All-in-all, I felt this cartoon film to be a perfect film for those of all ages, one that I would love to share, watch, or buy again.",Ice Age

It had a lot of action in it and I recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of movies. This movie is also a very good movie for kids of all ages. Most kids will enjoy this movie because it was funny and had a lot of adventure in it. For example, all the adventures Sid and Manny went through to take the baby back to his dad. They came encounter with animals they had to fight off in order to get to the cave men. This movie had a good ending because Sid and Manny finally found the cave men including the baby's father. The baby's father was very thankful when Sid and Manny brought the baby back which makes this movie very loving.",Ice Age
369,WingSun,Ice Age review,9,10 March 2007,"Ice Age is a great film, I have watched it for three times. It is an interesting and funny movie too! I think it is the best animation the world has ever had before.In the movie, the baby learned to walk and eat. She became friend of Diego- a tiger.This was really educative. I love the Dodo birds most, they protected their watermelons with their life. In the end, Diego changed his mind of saving the baby from other tigers instead of eating her. That showed justice, Diego was noble. Mannfred the Mammoth had saved Diego's life. That was the main factor that changed Diego's mind. They argued at the first but became good friends at the end.Ice Age is really too short, and I wished it would be longer. But the content is good.That's all I want to say. Hope everyone like this movie!",Ice Age
370,teenspirit91,Just saw it...,4,17 March 2002,"Not a bad movie. The plot line was a little formulaic, and it seemed to borrow a lot from ""Monster's Inc."" and ""Shrek."" The entire opening part where Sid first meets up with Manfred seems like the opening to ""Shrek"" where Donkey meets Shrek. Leguizamo does a great job in this movie, and lends himself nicely for most of the humor relief. Scrat, the little nut hunting squirrel thing was more of a nuisance than a funny anecdote for the film, and it could have done without him. Overall, I think this movie is decent, and should be seen in the theaters, but wait until it is on the cheaper screens, as it is too similar to previous CGI/Computer Animated Movies.",Ice Age
371,ecki-imdb,It is the time to recognize...,5,8 April 2002,"that not all animated movies are great. I was very disappointed from this movie. Slapstick does not get better if it is rendered.This movie is a tearpulling story from bad Disney productions combined with cheap and nerving slap stick. Especially in the german syncro with Otto Walkes as Sid, they managed to kill this movie.Some funny shots, most of them already seen in the trailers is not enough to make this a great movie.And I dont see any relationship to Titan AE. If you want to see a good animation, I would recommend you to visit Shrek 2 Times and forget about Ice Age.",Ice Age
372,mr_shush18,nice way to spend an hour and a half,7,15 March 2002,"I just got back from watching Ice Age and I found it to be fairly entertaining but aimed to a younger audience.  Most of the jokes involved sight gags that, albeit amusing, did not require much thought to understand. Although there were some jokes that older people would catch onto, such as the gay rhinos (don't worry it's clean).  The characters and plot were very similar to Monsters Inc (they find a human baby they don't care for but grow to love etc), but one does not go to a movie like this for the plot really. All and all it was entertaining and fun",Ice Age
373,zieben-imdb,"More rodents; less humans, please!",6,19 March 2002,"This film has some good moments, most of which are clearly derivative of some of the best of Chuck Jones. The scenes with the shrew-like character (shown in the long early trailer and several other scenes in the film) were the best parts. The casting of the voice roles throughout seemed good, but it would have made a better movie if they'd left out the humans and kept all the characters in the animal kingdom.",Ice Age
374,IcicleFyre,"Slapstick, heart, and more laughs than I've had in a while",9,27 March 2002,"Having been disappointed by the overrated Shrek, I was delighted to find the fun and whimsy in Ice Age that's been missing in recent films, particularly animated ones. Yes, there are moments, particularly at the beginning, that feel somewhat cliche, but how many ways are there to kick off a journey picture? The characters are strong, the voice acting is excellent, and the plot far more emotion-driven than one would expect from the previews. That being said, the reason I love this picture is the slapstick. It features, in the form of a bizarrely shaped buck-toothed squirrel and his eternal crusade to bury a nut, one of the most original and hysterically funny opening sequences and running gags I've ever seen. Watching Ice Age is like watching an hour and a half of Shrek's Gingerbread Man. I have not laughed this hard in a movie theatre in an extremely long time, and I'd recommend Ice Age to anyone of any age. Nothing too scary for little kids or too intense for the older crowd and enough wit and heart for everyone in between.",Ice Age
375,lovell,Really worth seeing,7,15 March 2002,"My family went to see this movie today, and I thought it was great. Visually, it is a stunning piece of film.  The background/landscpaes are excellent without taking away from the rest of the animation.  There are actually a few spots that make you look again because they seem so real.As far as the story goes, it is very sweet.  Far-fetched, maybe, but entertaining nonetheless.In a weird way, this could even be called a ""buddy movie"".  It wouldn't hurt to take a tissue along, either, especially for primary-grade kids.  I'll admit, there were a few seconds where having one myself wouldn't have hurt.I also think the voice-casting was right on.  You think ""Ray Ramano"", you think ""quirky family guy"".  You think ""John Leguizamo"" you think ""silly, silly, silly"".  You think ""Dennis Leary"" you think ""part-time jerk/part-time good guy"".  The supporting cast is also great.My husband and I have already decided this is definitely a movie to add to our collection when it's released on DVD.",Ice Age

I really really would love to watch his adventures on its own ... i don't need anything else ! ... lets just have 81 minutes of just that little prehistoric sabre-tooth squirrel trying to find the ""right"" spot to bury his acorn !...I even found myself going to Toys 'r' Us afterwards to see if i could find any ""Scrat"" soft toys ... obviously they have done their homework in marketing :)but at least he pops up from time time in the story, which was good, i found myself saying ""yeeees"" everytime the story had him involved !! .... Overall though, i felt was the story was a little shallow when you compare this to Pixar's ""Monsters INC"" but i think the animation IS better in 'Ice Age' ... the animators have really done a fantastic job of creating a realistic world, the shadows and lighting deserve a special mention, really wonderful to watch ! ... and even the humans (the hardest of creatures to realistically animate !) were believable !! .. however of course they didn't have to concentrate on the backgrounds quite *just* as much!Well, thats all i am going to say really ... i think the other reviews before this says everything about the story ...Just .....PLEASE ...

""its a film that kids will like and most adults, for not only does it bring out warmth in all but also things like how important Loyalty and freindship is,I give it  a  ten in my book, and its well worth seeing more then once, its about time we started getting good movies aginKaltag",Ice Age

Visually, the animation was amazingly detailed; there were lots of nice touches such as the wisps of breath shown when they entered the ice cave. If this movie strikes you as sounding interesting, go see it.  It's worth the money. If you have kids under 4, perhaps wait to see it at home.

This is because when Sid was following Manfred around, I immediately thought of when the Donkey kept following Shrek around. I could clearly tell that the writers of Ice Age thought through every single detail of the characters and the storyline itself and that is what is lacking in some films today.

386,supervince000,A nice and funny tale about friendship,8,11 January 2003,"Ice Age is a very pleasant animated movie. Through the story of a Mammoth, a sabertooth tiger and a sloth trying to bring a human baby back to his tribe during the ice age, it gives a nice tale about friendship. The movie is sometimes very funny and sometimes really moving. The ability to pass from laugh to tears is noteworthy. The characters are nicely shaped and very different in order to make their association very surprising. Yet, this combination makes the quality of the pack and allows our heroes to overcome the various challenges they meet on the way. As in most Disney movies,the motivation and values shared by the animals can be translated into human beings. It makes Ice Age a very pleasant and entertaining movie for all.",Ice Age

This one does not disappoint. The animation is, as usual, superb.  Ok, its not quite as spectacular as Shrek or the mighty Monsters Inc  but this film still gets you hooked from the beginning and never lets you go.  You end up feeling very strongly for the main characters and wishing them on at every step of the way.  There are a couple of sad bits in this film that will get the children and the sensitive people welling up but there are also a few bits in the movie that just have you howling with laughter. I cant give anything away so you're just gonna have to give it a chance and watch it yourself. I garantee that you'll enjoy it.  You'll never get bored as the main characters are always doing something to keep your attention ranging from the serious to the downright ludicrous.

392,ryan29-42-433698,"This is a simple yet entertaining film that children, along with parents will all enjoy.",8,1 May 2011,"This is a simple yet entertaining film that children, along with parents will all enjoy. This film is set back 20,000 years ago where three eccentric characters team up for an unexpected adventure. This is a story about Manfred (Ray Romano), a woolly mammoth, Diego (Denis Leary), a saber tooth tiger, and Sid (John Leguizame), a sloth. These three cross paths as Manfred the sad and lonely mammoth decides not to migrate south with the rest of the animals where he runs into the stuttering and fast-talking Sid the sloth. As also seen in the movie Shrek, Sid becomes a follower of the loner. The two together run into a lost child. To Sid and Manfred he is a lost child but to Diego the child is prey. Diego was ordered to bring this child back to his pack as the pack sought revenge on the humans. Diego deceptively offers help in returning the child back to his family and their journey begins across mountains of ice. This awkward combination of characters brings humor and comedy to the screen. Not to forget one of the most humorous and speechless characters alone, Scrat, a half squirrel, half rat that has set out on a mission of his own. In doing so, each character learns to work together and eventually become friends. Their differing personalities mixed together provide for a mission full of laughs and giggles. This films simplicity allows watchers to just sit down and be entertained. The voices of all the characters were impeccable. From the stutter of Sid to the grave tone of Diego. These animated voices brought these characters to life and provided personality. This personality contributed to the adventures of this team's journey.This film reaches out to children as well as the adults. The simplicity of the film plot allows for children to easily follow these lively characters throughout their journey. This film also shows depth as it looks brings details to the characters. From the beginning of the film Manfred was seen only as a loner deciding to travel north alone. His character was expanded with reasoning as he viewed the art within the cave. This brought great continuity to the film as each of the characters brought their contributions to the team. Ice age was simple and entertaining enough for children pleasure and added enough depth and emotions for adult interests. Entertainment for the whole family!",Ice Age
393,nick-alfonso,Ice Age is a solid family movie most intended for children 6 and up.,6,1 May 2011,"Ice Age is just one a slew of computer generated films aimed for young children and families that came out in the early 2000s. It centers around three friends; a woolly mammoth named Manny who is voiced by Ray Romano, a saber-toothed tiger called Diego who is voiced by Denis Leary, and a smooth-talking, dimwitted sloth named Sid, who is voiced by John Leguizamo. Together the three friends face the destruction of their home by impending glaciers brought on by a coming ice age, all the while trying to return a human baby back to his village.As with most family friendly movies, this one centers around friendship, trust and togetherness as the three reluctant friends face many hardships such as lava pits, glaciers, and ice caverns all to accomplish their goal. Though this film is solid, it doesn't rank with the powerhouses of family films such as Shrek, mostly because of the pacing and lack of thrill. The movie is funny, but not because of the usually reasons, such as the characters finding themselves in zany predicaments, but rather the characters themselves add to the majority of the humor. Manny, the mammoth is boorish and slow, Diego is slick and somewhat devilish, while Sid is fast talking but not fast thinking. The character combination is what makes the film generally enjoyable. However, the most enjoyable character is one that does not get equal billing with the others, and that is Scrat. Scrat is a saber-toothed squirrel, who wants nothing more than to secure his fortune that comes in the form of an elusive acorn. Throughout the film the camera will cut to Scrat chasing the acorn and finding himself in some hilarious situations. Yes, the bulk of the comedy focuses mainly on Scrat, and most adults would find his scenes more entertaining than watching the rest of the animals on their adventure. This is most likely because the pacing is as slow as Manny lumbering up a hill. As you watch the movie, you find it obvious that the pacing is set more for children than adults, which is okay, except that there are some rather scary scenes in which most young children shouldn't watch it alone without adults their to reassure them.As far as the artistic styling of the film, the lighting, and camera angles, and colors are all brilliant and vibrant throughout the film, and they tie in well with the overall attitude of the movie being of a light and airy sort. The theme does well to show kids that friendships can be made and challenges overcome with teamwork. For the most part, Ice Age is a solid family movie most intended for children 6 and up.",Ice Age

395,matt-staples,Ice Age Review by Matt Staples,9,29 December 2012,"Ice Age is a great animated film with an amazing voicing cast. Ray Ramano as Manfred the mammoth is instantly recognizable. To hear the voice of Ray Barone as an ancient elephant is a lot of fun. Also to have Denis Leary is amazing as the saber toothed tiger Diego. He throws you off because you often hear a swear word laced in his speech. Sid the sloth is also a stand out character voiced by John Leguizamo. So the movie takes you on a journey in a time before people could talk and the concept of fire is pretty much a new thing. While all the animals are migrating north Manfred an outcast is heading south. On his way Manfred is joined company by Diego and Sid. They encounter a women swept on a river bank trying to get her baby out of the freezing water. Manfred and Sid make it their mission to return the baby to ""its own herd"". So we are brought on a fun journey as they return the baby. Manfred and Sid come across Diego who pretends to be friends with the two, while holding an agenda that will will betray Manfred and Sid. I was really impressed by how much I enjoyed this movie. Everything from the way the characters were created and who they were voicing them. The story is unique and will make you smile.",Ice Age
396,mallory34,Just not funny,4,28 November 2004,"I'm usually a big fan of computer animated movies, so I had high hopes for Ice Age because of its big budget and recognizable voice cast. However, I was a more than a little disappointed with the non-organic, almost polygonal animation of what should have been organic, believable characters. Character development wasn't believable, and verged on stereotypical, and the humor just wasn't funny. I was hoping for jokes and scenarios that would appeal to both adults and children, but any attempts at more adult humor by the movie didn't go over too well. Perhaps the worst mistake that Ice Age made was casting the monotonous Ray Romano as the voice of the main character. Normally, cartoon characters need a voice with range and variety, and Romanos voice was lacking in both. The only scenes that I partially enjoyed were the ones with the squirrel, but the running-gag of the squirrel never getting the nut got old quickly. If it's on TV, go ahead and watch it, but don't waste your time and money on a rental. I know that they pretty much hold the monopoly on computer animation films, but check out anything by Pixar instead.",Ice Age
397,reddead9889,One of the most underrated and best movies i ve ever seen,10,30 July 2013,"Ice Age has a very unique direction going for it. It follows the amazing journey of 3 animals who find a baby and they need to bring it to his parents. The charetersare all well written and amazing. Diego the sarcastic tiger, manny the good hearted mammoth and Sid them comic and sometimes annoying 3 finger lazy. I really like the humor of the movie as it is at the right amount and very well done. The voice acting is very good and the design of the world is amazing. What makes this movie so great is how emotional it is. There are 2 scenes in particular that made my cry bad, and for a movie to make someone like me cry it shows how amazing it is.",Ice Age
398,vegetable_milkshake,"A great warm, funny movie in the golden age of 3D animation.",10,25 March 2005,"I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out, back in '02. I was only 13 at the time, but even then I liked it. It had some sort of warmth.We've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it, it never gets boring. This is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3D animations made at the time - The characters have no particular 'home' which they leave. They are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch.Also, each individual character on the surface, appear to be just putting up with each other, but they're really all good friends. As well, all of the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). Sid the sloth is charming in his annoying, over-affectionate and naive sort of way. Manny is adorable in his depressed, reclusive character, and so on and so forth.Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. All the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay, giving the film an artistic edge.Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie, is that gender means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film. Due to this, there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.",Ice Age
399,mushi_azn,Am I the only one who didn't like this?,3,5 April 2005,"Personally, I didn't like it. Me giving it 3/10 is pretty generous in my opinion. All the jokes....were old. They were all previously used in previous Disney/Dreamworks cartoons, The Simpsons, and other comedy sitcoms. Seriously. All the comedy was predictable and dull. The writers were in desperate need for new material. The storyline wasn't that bad. But wasn't too interesting either. The idea of a group having to return a baby to its rightful home has been done many times. If you're going to make a movie with a cliché concept, you're gonna have to make it GOOD. Make it original. Make it different from all the others. This, was just pathetic. You knew what was going to happen from the beginning too. It was just a dull, 'same old' plot from a cartoon that would have been original in 1991. The whole movie, everything... from the jokes, the actions, the plot, the character development, even the dialog...was predictable. This movie, was disappointing. and I'm a huge animation/cartoon fan. It's easy to impress me. But this...was just a waste of my time and money. Boo.",Ice Age

Comedy, Drama, and it has a really good storyline, with another ongoing storyline. That of Scrat's Acorn Hunt. Ice Age has to be my favourite film ever, as i never get bored of it! The voices a great, as well as the characters themselves. Sid's voice in my opinion being the best as well as him being my favourite character in the film.. All three main characters have background issues going on which we are told more about as the film unfolds. The detail on the animation is very good as well.. You can tell when they're wet. You can see every different hair on Manfred's body, and you can see it swaying in the wind. I have just found out that they're making a sequel. Let's hope it is as good if not better than the first one.. Undoubtedly it will be a great animated film. Let's hope we see Sid, Manfred, Diago and Scrat in the sequel as well as some new faces!",Ice Age
401,bmovieluver,cute,8,29 July 2005,Filled with clichés of all cartoons this one still has enough to overcome its mediocre story. The cast has a blast with the characters who are all well thought out. The characters with great voices are the highlight here. It looks great and can be fun if you let it. It is an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of the pixar movies but fails to get the magic of those wonderful films. The writing is only half what those movies are although the look and cast seems top notch. It is certainly one that can be enjoyed by kids although adults might have a hard time sitting through it as they've seen the same basics done a million times over since they were kids.,Ice Age
402,cosmidumi-1,A little story,10,17 August 2005,"After an attack by a pack of saber-toothed cats (Soto, the leader, with Diego, Zeke and another) a camp of Neanderthal humans try to protect their women and children. Jumping into a raging river with her baby, one woman is dragged downstream. She manages to place the infant on an embankment but is too drained to climb out of the water herself. Soto orders Diego to find the baby and bring it to him alive. Meanwhile the animals are all trying to avoid the coming ice age by retreating to warmer climates. Left by his family, Sid, a clumsy Sloth, is rescued from two rhinoceroses by Manfred, one of the last remaining mammoths. Not wanting to be alone Sid follows Manfred, much to the mammoth's annoyance. Sid and Manfred spot the baby on the side of the river and decide to return it to its tribe, but when they get there the humans have already left. Diego, still trying to pinch the baby, convinces the pair that he knows where the humans are going and begins leading Sid and Manfred to find them. Over the course of their adventures Diego realizes that it would be wrong to harm the child and works with Sid and Manfred to return it to the tribe. At one point he even fights off his former pack. Eventually finding the humans, the trio return the child and say an emotional goodbye to the baby they had gotten somewhat attached to. A subplot involving Scrat, a sabre-toothed prehistoric squirrel who defends his beloved acorn with paranoid fervor, is continued in the follow-up short film ""Gone Nutty"". Alert viewers will notice the plot has some similarity to Disney's animated version of The Jungle Book (1967). Great Movie: ICE AGE!",Ice Age

405,bikini_bottom_7,Overall review,10,27 January 2006,"I thought that Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a woman of 30, with no children, I still seem to really enjoy these humorous, witty animated movies. Sid is the best character I have seen in some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really humorous, and I did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the movie at least 15 times (I own it obviously) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasions...yes,still). My favourite scene is the part where Sid says ""Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!"" and Sid and Manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the ""tigers""...""Pack of wolves, pack of bears, pack of fleas, pack of whiskers, pack of noses, pack a derm?, pack of lies, pack of troubles, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish..."" or however that part goes! That is THE funniest part about the whole movie, although I also really enjoyed the humour behind ""putting sloths on the map"" and many other parts as well. The only animated movie that can remotely compare to Ice Age is ""Brother Bear"".",Ice Age
406,kimdockins,"A Lovable, Heart-Thawing Film",8,30 January 2019,"Definitely the best in the (what would soon be) franchise. I say that even if other people say that the franchise as a whole is awful, at least check this film out. While they aren't wrong in saying the other films in the franchise are terrible, this one holds a special place in several people's hearts.Since the story's too good to give away, i'll simply fill you in on the characters.I enjoy Sid's personality a lot. He's a small, wimpy guy, but tries his hardest to make some form of impact. From some sources, it was said that he was intended to be a hustler/con-artist, which I would have liked to see. I think Diego is quite enjoyable as well. In my option, he should have had somewhat of a redemption ark given he wasn't the nicest when the group first met him. However, they make up for it in a short, but sweet reveal sequence when he bids a key character farewell.I think the character that really breaks the ice in this film is Manny. He's the largest, loudest and most threatening in the ragtag group of misfits, but won't hesitate to stand up for his friends. The backstory of his family is very saddening to me, most likely because i've gone through something similar to it.Ice Age might have some problems in it's story and it's CGI hasn't aged super well, but for what we got, it's a fun little movie that'd i'd like to see a few more times in the future.One final note. My favorite scene from this film (and the entire franchise) is the opening with Scrat. No dialogue. No music. Just the low howls of wind and the saber-toothed screw up doing what he does best; wreaking havoc.",Ice Age
